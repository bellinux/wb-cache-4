40|$|Mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, {{showed a}} high {{bioaccumulation}} ability {{when exposed to}} waterborne <b>tetrabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> (BDE- 47), with a bioconcentration factor of 10, 900 L Kg- 1 wet weight, and slow depuration rates in clean seawater. Kinetic and concentration– response experiments were performed measuring in the exposed mussel the activities of three molecular biomarkers: glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The long term (30 days) exposure of mussels to all concentrations (2 – 15 lg L- 1) of BDE- 47 significantly inhibited the AChE and GST activities, a result that supports the suitability of these biomarkers in marine pollution monitoring programs. However, GPx activity showed a less consistent pattern of response depending on the concentration and the duration of exposure. Versión del edito...|$|E
40|$|Polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers are lipophilic persistent {{organic pollutants}} (POPs), which accumulate in the environment, leading to human exposure. The compounds exert {{a negative impact on}} human health. Strategies to prevent or diminish their accumulation in humans are required. We investigated in rats whether the disposal rate of C- 14 -labeled <b>tetrabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> (BDE- 47) could be enhanced by increasing fecal fat excretion through dietary treatment with nonabsorbable fat (sucrose polyester, SPE). As compared to control rats, SPE treatment increased fecal excretion rates of fat (+ 188 %, p < 0. 05) and C- 14 -BDE- 47 (+ 291 %, p < 0. 05). On the basis of biliary secretion and fecal excretion rates of C- 14 -BDE- 47, SPE effectively inhibited the enterohepatic circulation of C- 14 -BDE- 47. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of nonabsorbable fat can enhance excretion of hydrophobic POPs by interruption of their enterohepatic circulation. Our data indicate that this strategy could decrease concentrations of hydrophobic POPs in the human body and thereby their impact on human health...|$|E
30|$|Industrial {{chemicals}} like {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} [PCBs], perfluorinated compounds [PFCs], and polybrominated diphenyl ethers [PBDEs] {{have been used}} in innumerable applications for many years. In recent years, however, it became clear that these compounds are by no means unproblematic when reaching the environment. Many of them are highly persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic. Furthermore, the substances themselves or their precursors are subject to long-range transport and have been detected in biota in remote areas like the Arctic and Antarctica (e.g., [1 – 16]). These findings led to the inclusion of PCBs, certain PBDEs (i.e., hexabromodiphenyl ether, heptabromodiphenyl ether, <b>tetrabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether,</b> and pentabromo-diphenyl ether), as well as the PFCs' perfluorooctane sulfonic acid [PFOS] and its salts and perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride into the list of persistent organic pollutants [POPs] covered by the Stockholm Convention on POPs [17, 18]. Already 9 years earlier, in 2000, a voluntary phase-out of PFOS was initiated by its main producer 3 M. Others, like perfluorooctanoic acid [PFOA] are still under evaluation. In the European Union [EU], PCBs and technical Penta- and Octa-BDEs were banned already in 1985 and 2004, respectively [19, 20]. An EU-wide restriction of Deca-BDE followed in 2008 (curia.europa.eu; case C- 14 / 06).|$|E
30|$|PBDEs are {{extensively}} used {{in various}} types of electronic equipment, furniture, plastics, textiles, etc. due to their excellent flame retardant performance (Leonel et al. 2014). Since PBDEs can be easily incorporated into different materials and products without making any covalent bonds, they could transport and migrate to different environment through volatilization and effusion etc. (Kim et al. 2007). Therefore, PBDEs have become widespread environmental pollutants and are ubiquitous in the environment (Birgul et al. 2012). Due to their persistency, long-range environmental transport potential and bioaccumulation ability, four PBDE congeners (i.e. <b>tetrabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether,</b> pentabromodiphenyl ether, hexabromodiphenyl ether and heptabromodiphenyl ether) have been listed as new persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in 2009 (Stockholm Convention 2009). Previous studies demonstrated that PBDEs have {{a wide range of}} toxicities, including cytotoxicity (An et al. 2011), developmental neurotoxicity (Costa et al. 2014), genotoxicity (Ji et al. 2011), disruption of thyroid functions (Xu et al. 2014), reproductive toxicity (Muirhead et al. 2006) and carcinogenicity (Zhao et al. 2015). Penta-BDEs are reported to be the most toxic compounds among the PBDEs congeners. Deca-BDEs received the least concern among PBDEs congeners on account of its relatively lower toxicity (Gandhi et al. 2011). However, the higher-brominated PBDEs congeners (hepta-BDEs to deca-BDEs) could be degraded/transformed to lower-brominated PBDEs congeners which seems to be more toxic in various environments such as soil, aquatic ecosystems (Huang et al. 2014). Therefore, PBDEs had posed a great threat to both human health and the global environment.|$|E
40|$|Polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) are a {{class of}} global flame retardants whose residues have markedly increased in fish and human tissues during the last decade. They belong to persistent and toxic contaminants which needmore attention and toxicological study as their degradation in the environment is not well understood. This study characterizes 2, 2 ′, 4, 4 ′- <b>tetrabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> (BDE- 47) bioconcentration, elimination and biotransformation in juvenile turbot Psetta maxima, in order to evaluate the risk of its bioaccumulation in the marine environment. During this study, juvenile turbot were exposed to environmentally relevant BDE- 47 concentrations from 0. 001 to 1 μg/L for 16 days via aqueous exposure. This study found that juvenile turbot bioconcentrated and biotransformed BDE- 47. There {{was no difference in}} standard length or weight between control and exposed fish. Uptake and elimination of BDE- 47 by the turbot during exposure were examined in controlled laboratory experiments. Bioconcentration of BDE- 47 was similar in fish from all treatment groups. Bioconcentration was rapid and increased with exposure time, since the bioconcentration factor (BCF) was higher. However, elimination was slower in comparison and low elimination was detected after 10 days in clean water. BDE- 47 concentration in water influences the BCF. Half-life ranged between 37 and 108 days and theoretical times t 90 could range from 120 to 358 days. The present study demonstrates a stepwise debromination of BDE- 47 to BDE- 28.

40|$|Brominated {{flame retardants}} (BFRs) are {{a diverse group}} of chemicals, which are used to slow down or inhibit the {{development}} of fires. BFRs are incorporated into a wide range of consumer products that are considered as potential fire hazards, such as TV-sets, household appliances, computers, and textiles. The production and use of BFRs is extensive and consists of mainly tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and hexabromocyclododecan (HBCD). BFRs in general, but in particular the PBDEs, have led to both scientific and public concern since they have been found to bioaccumulate in humans and wildlife. The general population is targeted by the PBDEs due to their applications and via the food web. Occupational exposure occurs not only during direct handling of BFRs, but also during handling, repair and dismantling of flame retarded goods. This thesis is aimed to assess occupational exposure to BFRs. It is mainly focused PBDEs and especially the PBDEs with high bromine content, such as decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE- 209). The work has been accomplished by analysis of BFRs in indoor air at industries handling BFRs or flame retarded goods, and by analysis of blood drawn from workers with potential exposure to BFRs. A referent group, abattoir workers with no occupational exposure to PBDEs, was also investigated. Data from these cross-sectional investigations and from serum sampling during vacation in PBDE-exposed workers have been used for calculation of apparent halflives of hepta- to decaBDE in serum. The results clearly show that the workers were exposed to PBDEs when handling PBDE containing products or goods. The serum PBDE levels in computer technicians were found to correlate to the estimated cumulative work hours with computers. Exceptionally high concentrations of BDE- 209, almost up to 300 pmol/g lipid weight (l. w.) were observed in serum from rubber workers manufacturing or handling rubber compound that was flame retarded with a technical mixture of decabromodiphenyl ether (DecaBDE). Elevated concentrations of PBDEs with eight or nine bromine substituents were also observed. In an electronics dismantling plant, where elevated levels of PBDEs previously had been observed, reduced serum levels of some, but not all PBDE congeners were observed after industrial hygiene improvements. Notably, it was observed that the BDE- 209 concentrations in referents with no occupational exposure were similar to the concentrations of 2, 2 ’, 4, 4 ’- <b>tetrabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> (BDE- 47), {{often referred to as the}} most abundant PBDE congener in humans and wildlife. Additionally, PBDEs with high bromine content were found to have a fast rate of elimination or transformation in humans, based on serum analysis. BDE- 209 had an apparent half-life in serum of only 15 days. The possibility of quantifying BFRs, such as PBDEs, in human serum at low levels of detection has been achieved by reducing the contamination of the samples and procedural blanks. Major efforts have been done to develop routines and clean up methodology to enable an almost contamination-free environment at the laboratory. The use of a clean room has decreased PBDE levels in the blanks to acceptable limits. The modifications of the original analytical method have made it possible to quantify almost all PBDE congeners of interest in one GC/MS run. Occupational and general background exposure of BFRs to humans will continue as long as these chemicals are a part of our daily life and present as environmental contaminants. The present scientific knowledge of the potential health risks of these BFRs still needs to be further developed. It should be stressed that health effects to PBDEs have not been assessed in this work. It is the author's wish that this thesis should add another piece of knowledge to the puzzle of BFRs and BFR exposure to humans and that these data will be used in future risk assessments of PBDEs in particular...|$|E
40|$|Wild caught fish, {{especially}} marine fish, {{can contain}} {{high levels of}} persistent organic pollutants (POPs). In the Netherlands, especially eel from the main rivers have high POP levels. This led to a ban in 2011 on eel fishing due to health concerns. Many of the marine POPs have been related to adverse health effects such as endocrine disruption, neurodevelopmental problems, immune suppression and cancer. Although some mechanisms of action of POPs are clear, like dioxins binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and OH-PCBs binding to thyroid transport proteins, not all adverse health effects {{can be explained by}} these mechanisms of action. Epigenetic phenomena, such as DNA methylation, have been proposed as a possible molecular mechanism underlying adverse health effects. DNA methylation is a heritable modification, which refers to the addition of a methyl group to cytosine in a CpG dinucleotide. Observational studies have indeed shown that POPs can affect global DNA methylation, although results are inconsistent. Some animal studies as well as in vitro experiments suggest that POPs can affect gene-specific DNA methylation, however, the biological significance and relevance for humans is not clear. Therefore, this thesis aimed to 1) study the accumulation of POPs in men consuming eel from high-polluted areas 2) elucidate whether seafood-related POPs can induce aberrant DNA methylation and 3) to determine whether DNA methylation is related to functional endpoints and gene expression in vitro. For this purpose eight POPs that are abundantly present in seafood were chosen, namely 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), polychlorobiphenyl (PCB) 126 and 153, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), 2, 2 ′, 4, 4 ′- <b>tetrabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> (BDE- 47), tributyltin (TBT), and methylmercury (MeHg). Chapter 2 describes the in vitro effects of these POPs and mixtures thereof in H 295 R adrenocortical carcinoma cells. Relative responses for 13 steroid hormones and 7 genes involved in the steroidogenic pathway, and CYP 1 A 1, were analysed. PFOS induced the most pronounced effects on steroid hormone levels by significantly affecting 9 out of 13 hormone levels measured, with the largest increases found for 17 β-estradiol, corticosterone, and cortisol. Furthermore, TCDD, both PCBs, and TBT significantly altered steroidogenesis. Increased steroid hormone levels were accompanied by related increased gene expression levels. The differently expressed genes were MC 2 R, CYP 11 B 1, CYP 11 B 2, and CYP 19 A 1 and changes in gene expression levels were more sensitive than changes in hormone levels. The POP mixtures tested showed mostly additive effects, especially for DHEA and 17 β-estradiol levels. This study shows that some seafood POPs are capable of altering steroidogenesis in H 295 R cells at concentrations that mixtures might reach in human blood, suggesting that adverse health effects cannot be excluded. DNA methylation was not measured in this study due to the short exposure time, which was expected not to be sufficient for long-term epigenetic marks. Therefore, in chapters 3 A and 3 B a differentiation experiment was performed enabling long-term exposure to POPs. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were differentiated into mature adipocytes over a time-course of 10 days. The transcriptional regulatory cascade involved in adipocyte differentiation has been extensively studied, however the mechanisms driving the transcription are poorly understood. In chapter 3 A we therefore first explored the involvement of DNA methylation in transcriptional regulation during adipocyte differentiation. Genome-wide changes in DNA methylation were measured as well as the expression of adipogenic genes. The majority of these genes showed significant expression changes during the differentiation process. There were, however, only a couple of these differentially expressed genes that were differentially methylated. Genome-wide DNA methylation changes were most often located in intergenic regions, and underrepresented close to the transcription start site. This suggested that changes in DNA methylation are not the underlying mechanism regulating gene expression during adipocyte differentiation. Nevertheless, we explored DNA methylation differences after continuous exposure to POPs to investigate whether this could be an underlying mechanism by which POPs affect adipocyte differentiation. TCDD and PFOS decreased lipid accumulation, while TBT increased lipid accumulation. TCDD and TBT induced opposite gene expression profiles, whereas after PFOS exposure gene expression remained relatively stable. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis showed that all three POPs affected DNA methylation patterns in adipogenic and other genes, but without concomitant gene expression changes. Differential methylation was again predominantly detected in intergenic regions, where the biological relevance of alterations in DNA methylation is unclear. This study demonstrated that POPs, at environmentally relevant levels, are able to induce differential DNA methylation in differentiating adipocytes. However, the biological relevance of this aberrant DNA methylation remains unclear. The in vitro results showed a proof of principle that POPs could be capable of altering DNA methylation. To this date, no human studies were performed investigating the relationship between POP levels and genome-wide DNA methylation. In order to investigate this, we first measured POP levels in eel consumers from the high-polluted areas (areas with a ban on eel fishing) and compared these levels to men consuming eel from low-polluted areas or aquaculture (chapter 4). We aimed to investigate the accumulation of these POPs and determine whether the predictions made in an earlier risk assessment were valid. This was indeed the case as levels of dioxins and dioxin-like compounds were on average 2. 5 times higher in men consuming eel from high-polluted areas. Furthermore, PCBs with their hydroxylated metabolites, and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) were, up to ten times, higher in these consumers. Especially the high levels of dioxins and dioxin-like compounds as well as the OH-PCBs are expected to be of health concern. We continued this research in chapter 5 by associating all the measured POPs to clinical parameters related to e. g. thyroid hormones and liver enzymes, but found no relationship. Subsequently, we investigated the association between dioxins and dioxin-like compounds, the sum of seven indicator PCBs, and PFOS with genome-wide DNA methylation. We detected a number of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) related to genes involved in carcinogenesis (e. g. BRCA 1, MAGEE 2, HOXA 5), the immune system (e. g. RNF 39, HLA-DQB 1), in retinol homeostasis (DHRS 4 L 2), or in metabolism (CYP 1 A 1). In contrast to the in vitro data, most significant effects were detected in CpG islands and were annotated close to the promoter region. This suggests that the differential methylation might be related to differential expression and possibly induce adverse health effects. The hypermethylation of some of these gene related to cancer could be an explanation of the carcinogenic effects that are observed with POP exposure. Based on the results of this thesis we can conclude that the consumption of eel from high-polluted areas lead to accumulation of POPs above safe levels and that POP levels are associated with gene-specific DNA methylation in vitro as well as in environmentally exposed men. More research, however, is needed to fully elucidate the biological implications of this aberrant DNA methylation. A first step can be to measure histone modifications, as these two epigenetic marks together are likely better in predicting gene expression. The second step can be to investigate the potential health effects related to these epigenetic marks and to determine whether there is a causal relationship. Although at this point {{there is a lack of}} knowledge with regard to health effects caused by DNA methylation, the consumption of eel from these high-polluted areas is ill- advised, because adverse health effects cannot be excluded based on our results and can even be expected based on literature...|$|E
