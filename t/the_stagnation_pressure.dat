40|$|AbstractIn {{supersonic}} two-phase {{flows of}} steam, {{under the influence}} of rapid expansion, the vapor becomes supersaturated. Following this condition, nucleation happens during the vapor phase; formed tiny droplets grow along the passage and, therefore, the condensation phenomenon occurs. The effects of the condensation phenomenon in power steam turbines include efficiency drop and mechanical damage. In the previous work of the authors, volumetric heating was introduced as an approach towards reducing the mentioned damage and loss. However, further investigations revealed that heating decreases the mass flow rate, which can be increased by adjusting <b>the</b> inlet <b>stagnation</b> <b>pressure.</b> In this paper, using a semi-analytical and a one-dimensional modeling approach, the simultaneous effects of volumetric heat transfer and inlet <b>stagnation</b> <b>pressure</b> variation are investigated in order to remedy the mass flow rate reduction.
