40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experimental}} and numerical investigation is to analyze the effects of burner configuration {{on the characteristics of}} biogas flameless combustion. In the four non- premixed studied burners, the inlet jet of the fuel is located {{at the center of the}} burner, surrounded by four oxidizer parallel jets in the coaxial burners and four perpendicular jets in the tangential configuration. In the three-dimensional (3 D) computational fluid dynamic (CFD) study, a two-step reaction scheme, eddy dissipation concept (EDC), eddy dissipation method (EDM), and the realizable k- e formulation were set for all simulations. The results illustrate that the volume of the flame is wider in a <b>tangential</b> <b>burner</b> and, hence, the tem- perature uniformity in the <b>tangential</b> flameless <b>burner</b> is more than coaxial configurations. The inside temperature of the furnace and the combustor’s wall temperature are higher in the tangential burner; consequently, higher heat loss from walls was recorded in tangential mode. Despite the higher energy loss from walls in the <b>tangential</b> <b>burner,</b> the efficiency of biogas flameless combustion in the tangential is more than the coaxial burners (66 % and 64 %, respectively). The concentration of CH 4 in the exhaust gases was recorded at 48 ppm and 60 ppm in the <b>tangential</b> and coaxial <b>burners,</b> respectively, which confirms that the combustion of biogas is more complete in the <b>tangential</b> flameless <b>burner.</b> The lower con- centration of oxygen in the <b>tangential</b> <b>burner</b> conducts the combustion system to generate higher carbon monoxide (CO) based on the two-step combustion concep...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPerformed {{investigation}} of pulverized fuel combustion in swirl flows {{has shown that}} there are two important groups of influential parameters: fuel and burner characteristics. The most important conclusion of these investigations is that each type of fuel needs a defined burner for its combustion and concrete operating parameters for its optimal work. Optimal operating parameters can be determined only by performing the appropriate experiments. Selection of optimal swirl burner design is dependent on energy loss which is used for air transport through burner. Increasing of swirl intensity is convenient for fuel ignition and flame stability, but energy loss for air transport increases, too. Swirl economy is estimated using hydraulic resistance parameter which represents energy loss due to swirling. In the paper are presented the methods and experimental data of hydraulic resistance determination for three laboratory models of swirl burners for pulverized fuel combustion.

This paper presents investigations towards finding new ways for the minimization of NOx emissions in the power boiler. These analyses were done in two directions: two stages of combustion into the furnace and {{a new system of}} re­-circulating gases. The purpose of carrying out both analyses had the objective of diminishing the emission of nitrogen oxides during the combustion processes. Both analyses were developed in a steam generator that currently working in the power plant "Villa de Reyes", Mexico. This steam generator Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of 350 MW is equipped with four levels of <b>tangential</b> <b>burners</b> and it bums fuel oil (C 23 H 37. 29) during its operation. These analyses were carried out {{from the point of view}} of decreasing temperatures in the active burning zone (ABZ). The methodology is based on four main parameters related to combustion process in the furnace active burning zone (ABZ). Such parameters are the following: air excess coefficient in ABZ, average temperature in ABZ, reflected heat in ABZ and the residence time of combustion products in the ABZ. Two stage of combustion is achieved by having three levels of burners in the bottom operate rich and the top level supply air only. The first volume bums 100 % of fuel oil with 75 % of air. In the second volume bums 00 /o of fuel and is introduced 25 % of air. As a result, the decrease of NOx formation is up to 25 % in comparison to current emissions. On the other hand, the thermal calculation of furnace was done, and with the results it would be possible to change the place of recirculation gases to the hot air, changing the combustion processes and move the flame core position. The changes of the parameters to calculate NOx formation are the following: different thermal loads of the power boiler from 50 %, 75 %, 100 % and maximum load. Different fractions of recirculation gases are introduced from 23 % up to 61 %. As result, it is possible to decrease NOx emission up to 50 % in comparison to current emissions. ej 201...|$|R

40|$|Lean {{premixed}} swirl stabilized combustion {{is one of}} {{the most}} successful technologies for NOx reduction in gas turbines. The creation of inherent coherent structures such as recirculation zones {{is one of the}} main advantages of these flow-stabilized systems since these zones create regions of low velocity that allow heat transfer improvement between reactants and products while increasing residence time for unburned species. However, these effects can also affect the stability of the flame under lean conditions, with various instabilities that can appear during the combustion stage such as flashback, blowoff, autoignition, etc. These processes are even more complex when new alternative fuels are being used for power generation applications. Synthesis gases (syngas) are some of the most concerning out of the available range of fuels as their heating values, flame speeds, ignition energies, etc. are highly dependent on the combination of species that comprise them. Since new gas turbines need to deal with these new blends for fuel flexibility and current lean premixed swirled stabilized systems seem to be the most cost effective-technical option to keep NOx down, gas turbine designers need more information on how to properly design their equipment to achieve stable flames with low NOx whilst avoiding instabilities.

40|$|Trying {{to improve}} gas {{turbines}} {{to be flexible}} to use different fuels requires a big challenge for gas turbine designers when working with current operation stability issues. Flashback is the major challenge for low NOx premixed combustion of high hydrogen content fuels. Flashback in gas turbine combustors is usually assigned to four mechanisms; core flow flashback, combustion instability flashback, boundary layer flashback (BLF) and combustion induced vortex breakdown (CIVB). The last two mechanisms are most common in swirl combustors, which are used to have better operation stability and low emissions. Improvement of swirl combustors against CIVB has been studied extensively to improve the combustion stability. The most promising solutions of CIVB are limited because the improvement against CIVB worsens the system against boundary layer flashback. Boundary layer flashback is theoretically based on the Lewis von Elbe’s formula for laminar flame, with formulas also used in turbulent flames (with some reservation) by most recent studies. However, the majority of studies take the flame side of the formula, parameters such as fuel type and blends, pressure and preheat temperature, and try to improve {{the understanding of the}} boundary layer flashback hoping to find ways to reduce its onset. However, the effect of the burner nozzle has not been studied in many types of research, especially the internal nozzle surfaces. Therefore, this work aims to study the effect of regular surface roughness on the boundary layer flashback in a 150 kW <b>tangential</b> swirl <b>burner.</b> The first part of this study is a numerical simulation using the in-house code Hydr 3 D to simulate the flow over riblets with different geometries (blade, triangular, scallop, diamond, lotus and sharkskin).

40|$|In {{recent decades}} {{there has been}} a strong trend towards the use of lean {{premixed}} combustion in order to produce gas turbine systems that are compliant with air quality regulations. Additional growing interest in using alternative fuels has drawn many problems in terms of operational stability, thus there have been extensive investigations to achieve more stable and reliable combustion systems. Flame flashback {{has been one of the}} major instability problems that have the potential of causing considerable damage to the combustion system hardware in addition to significant increase of emissions such as CO and NOX. Swirl combustors are proven as effective flame stabilisers over wide range of operation conditions due to swirl structures which provide a low velocity region that enables flame anchoring. However the interaction between swirl structures and swirl burner geometries can considerably alter the stability regime downstream the burner exit plane. Using central injectors either as a central bluff body or to inject fuel diffusively have been used successfully to achieve wide stability limits and prevent upstream flame propagation. However, central injectors in swirl combustors can be subject to large amounts of heat, which can cause flashback, subsequently increasing maintenance cost and reducing the predicted operating life of the system. This paper present a series of experiments using a well-characterised <b>tangential</b> swirl <b>burner</b> to investigate the effect of using diffusive air injection on flow field characteristics and how it can affect the lower instability limits through altering the flashback mechanism by Combustion Induced Vortex Breakdown (CIVB). Results show that using diffusive air stream injection affects flashback trends significantly by providing a wider range of stability limits both in terms of equivalence ratio and mass flow rate which implies the possibility of working at higher power outputs compared to the case when using a central body injector. This technique can be considered a promising technology in terms of flexibility of operation because it enables switching to another air stream diameter while maintaining full load operation as opposed to the use of central body injectors...|$|R

It presents a series of experiments to determine the impact of different configurations on flame flashback mechanisms. Experiments were performed using a 150 kW <b>tangential</b> swirl <b>burner</b> working on premixed mode with various swirl numbers; the flow field characteristics were measured by 1 D LDA. The {{first part of the}} project targeted the effect of central fuel injector geometries on flame flashback mechanisms, especially combustion induced vortex breakdown (CIVB). It was found that changing the central fuel injector outside diameter can significantly alter the flame flashback mechanism. Large injector diameters result in boundary layer flashback (BLF), contrary, the use of small injectors diameter led to CIVB. Thus a dimensionless number (χ) which represent the ratio between the injector outside diameter and the nozzle inside diameter was introduced. Using this dimensionless number the critical value of transition from CIVB to BLF has been defined, the value being χ= 0. 280 for Sg= 1. 12 and χ= 0. 320 for Sg= 0. 9. The second part was about the effect of using axial air injection instead of central fuel injectors. It was found that axial air jets have a considerable potential for flame stability requirements, they producing wider stability operation than that of central injectors. Moreover, the stability limits increase regarding both equivalence ratio and inlet tangential velocity. It appeared that using such air jets could reduce the combustor maintenance cost that arises due to a continuous harsh environment. However, it was found that axial air jets could enforce flame propagation during flashback via wall boundary layer. Thus, the third part of the study was about the validity of using micromeshes to improve BLF resistance in addition to axial air injection. It was found that using both techniques produced high flashback resistance for both mechanisms, i. e. CIVB and BLF...|$|R

However, the use of new fuels faces many issues especially the problem of stability of operation which sometimes can cause severe damages to the system hardware. Thus the development of flexible combustion systems for gas turbines becomes urgent in order to achieve high reliability with these new sources of energy. Swirl stabilized combustion is the most widely spread deployed technology used to stabilize and control combustion in gas turbines and numerous other systems. However, the interaction of the swirling flows with the burner geometries is very complex and it has been proved that any change in the burner geometry can affect the flow field inside the combustion chamber, close to the burner mouth and downstream the combustion zone. Most burners are generally provided with a diffusive injector that centrally delivers well-known fuels allowing the stabilization of the system previous to entirely premixed conditions. Moreover, the injector anchors the central recirculation zone formed downstream of the nozzle. However, the use of injectors can also affect the stability limits of the system, especially the propagation of flashback through changes of shape of the shear layer since other structures such as the Combustion Induced Vortex Breakdown are suppressed due to the presence of this central body. However, the characterization of the flow and its impacts on the propagation of these and other flashback structures using different injectors has been briefly documented.

The trend in the development of spot spraying equipment is an increase of the spatial resolution and new actuators that are able to target very small areas. However, there is a lack of methods for assigning rates of herbicides relating target to optimal droplet features. A wide range of droplet impact angles occurs during the spray application process because of droplet trajectories and the variability of leaf orientation. In this study, laboratory experiments were conducted to highlight the effect of surface orientation on droplet impact outcomes (adhesion, rebound or splashing) on two very difficult-to-wet surfaces: an artificial surface with a regular roughness pattern and an excised black-grass leaf with an anisotropic roughness pattern. Measurements were performed for different surface orientations with a high-speed camera coupled with backlighting LED. Droplets of two formulations (distilled water and distilled water + a surfactant) were produced with a moving flat-fan hydraulic nozzle to obtain a wide range of droplet sizes and velocities, which were measured by image analysis. Increasing surface angle reduces surface area available for droplet capture. Droplet impact behaviors are then modified since surface <b>tilt</b> induces a <b>tangential</b> velocity component at impact and, consequently, a reduction of the normal component. Impact modifications have also been observed due to the anisotropic roughness pattern of a black-grass leaf.
