25|$|It is {{possible}} to improve the match between graduate training and employer requirements when relevant organizations interact with university faculty and manage to obtain money for laboratories and equipment. The competence of medical laboratory technicians was improved in five Ethiopian universities. In-service training was too disruptive to normal services which already suffered from staff shortages. The Centre for Disease Control Ethiopia and the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP) together with university faculty assessed medical laboratory education. The curriculum was revised and standardized to include practical training which formed part of the final assessment. Faculty staff were trained in grant writing and quality management systems. The United States President's fund for AIDS relief provided money for equipment, including an uninterrupted power supply and consumables. Lecturers were trained {{to use the new}} curriculum, improve their <b>teaching</b> <b>skills</b> and up-date their knowledge through website resources supplied by ASCP consultants.

The reborn Hallé's first concert somehow lived up to the Hallé's great reputation." [...] The Musical Times also noted, [...] "From his earliest days with the orchestra it was the string tone that commanded immediate attention and respect. There was a fiery intensity and glowing warmth that proclaimed the born string coach". Barbirolli retained his reputation for training orchestras: after his death, one of his former players commented, [...] "If you wanted orchestral experience you'd be set for life, starting in the Hallé with John Barbirolli." [...] Further afield, critics, audiences and players in Europe and the United States commented on the improvement in the playing of their orchestras when Barbirolli was in charge. Later he extended his <b>teaching</b> <b>skills</b> to the Royal Academy of Music, where he took charge of the student orchestra from 1961.|$|E
500|$|Some {{children}} {{were trained in}} skills valuable to the area. [...] In Shrewsbury, the boys {{were placed in the}} workhouse's workshop, while girls were tasked with spinning, making gloves and other jobs [...] "suited to their sex, their ages and abilities". [...] At St Martin in the Fields, {{children were}} trained in spinning flax, picking hair and carding wool, before being placed as apprentices. [...] Workhouses also had links with local industry; in Nottingham, children employed in a cotton mill earned about £60 a year for the workhouse. [...] Some parishes advertised for apprenticeships, and were willing to pay any employer prepared to offer them. [...] Such agreements were preferable to supporting children in the workhouse: apprenticed children were not subject to inspection by justices, thereby lowering the chance of punishment for neglect; and apprenticeships were viewed as a better long-term method of <b>teaching</b> <b>skills</b> to children who might otherwise be uninterested in work. [...] Supporting an apprenticed child was also considerably cheaper than the workhouse or outdoor relief. [...] Children often had no say in the matter, which could be arranged without the permission or knowledge of their parents. [...] The supply of labour from workhouse to factory, which remained popular until the 1830s, was sometimes viewed as a form of transportation. [...] While getting parish apprentices from Clerkenwell, Samuel Oldknow's agent reported how some parents came [...] "crying to beg they may have their Children out again". [...] Historian Arthur Redford suggests that the poor may have once shunned factories as [...] "an insidious sort of workhouse".|$|E

But I’m okay with that— I’m good with being unlikable." [...] Series creator Shonda Rhimes, discussing the rivalry between Hahn and her Resident Cristina Yang – which saw Hahn reprimanded by Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), Seattle Grace's Chief of Surgery, for her lack of encouragement— has given the insight: [...] "Hahn is a brilliant surgeon and is great with her patients but her <b>teaching</b> <b>skills?</b> [...] Well, let's just say she can use a little more loving care with her students, particularly Cristina. [...] I felt sorry for Hahn because Hahn grew up in a surgical world that included even fewer women than there is now (so Hahn is accustomed to a [...] "dog eat dog" [...] kind of surgical world)." [...] Trish Doolan, who consulted with the show's producers on the developing lesbian storyline between Hahn and Callie Torres, said of the character: [...] "She's very strong, very good at what she does, and actually a lot of men are threatened by that.
