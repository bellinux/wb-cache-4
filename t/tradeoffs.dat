25|$|There are two generic ideas how to {{visualize}} the Pareto front in high-order multi-objective decision problems (problems with more than two objectives). One of them, which is applicable {{in the case of}} a relatively small number of objective points that represent the Pareto front, is based on using the visualization techniques developed in statistics (various diagrams, etc. – see the corresponding subsection below). The second idea proposes the display of bi-objective cross-sections (slices) of the Pareto front. It was introduced by W.S. Meisel in 1973 who argued that such slices inform the decision maker on objective <b>tradeoffs.</b> The figures that display a series of bi-objective slices of the Pareto front for three-objective problems are known as the decision maps. They give a clear picture of <b>tradeoffs</b> between three criteria. Disadvantages of such an approach are related to two following facts. First, the computational procedures for constructing the bi-objective slices of the Pareto front are not stable since the Pareto front is usually not stable. Secondly, it is applicable in the case of only three objectives. In the 1980s, the idea W.S. Meisel of implemented in a different form – in the form of the Interactive Decision Maps (IDM) technique.|$|E

Platings usually fail only in small sections, but if the plating is more noble than the substrate (for example, chromium on steel), a galvanic couple will cause any exposed area to corrode much more rapidly than an unplated surface would.

40|$|Abstract. Cryptanalytic time memory <b>tradeoff</b> {{algorithms}} are {{tools for}} quickly inverting one-way functions and many consider the rainbow table method {{to be the}} most efficient <b>tradeoff</b> algorithm. However, it was recently announced, mostly based on experiments, that the parallelization of the perfect distinguished point <b>tradeoff</b> algorithm brings about an algorithm that is 50 % more efficient than the perfect rainbow table method. Motivated by this claim, we provide an accurate theoretic analysis of the parallel version of the non-perfect distinguished point <b>tradeoff</b> algorithm. Performance differences between different <b>tradeoff</b> algorithms are usually not very large, but even these small differences can be crucial in practice. So we take care not to ignore the side effects of false alarms while analyzing the online time complexity of the parallel distinguished point <b>tradeoff</b> algorithm. Our complexity results are used to compare the parallel non-perfect distinguished point <b>tradeoff</b> against the non-perfect rainbow table method. The two algorithms are compared under identical success rate requirements and the pre-computation efforts are taken into account.
