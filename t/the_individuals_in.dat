5|$|Fred Gildersleeve, a Waco-based {{professional}} photographer, {{arrived at}} city hall shortly before the lynching, possibly at the mayor's request, and photographed the event. His photographs provide rare depictions of a lynching in progress, rather than typical lynching photography, which only shows dead victims. Gildersleeve's photographs include views of the crowd shot from a building and close images of Washington's body; some may have been taken by an assistant. Gildersleeve produced postcards featuring images of adolescents, some as young as twelve, gathered around Washington's body. <b>The</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>in</b> the photographs made no attempts to hide their identities. Berg believes that their willingness to be photographed indicates that they knew {{that no one would}} be prosecuted for Washington's death. Although some Waco residents sent the cards to out-of-town relatives, several prominent local citizens persuaded Gildersleeve to stop selling them, fearing that the images would come to characterize the town.|$|E
25|$|Militants {{published}} a newspaper, The Waterfront Worker, {{which focused on}} longshoremen's most pressing demands: more men on each gang, lighter loads and an independent union. While a number of <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>in</b> this group were Communist Party members, {{the group as a}} whole was independent of the party: although it criticized the International Seamen's Union (ISU) as weak and the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA), which had its base on the East Coast, as corrupt, it did not embrace the MWIU, but called instead for creation of small knots of activists at each port to serve as {{the first step in a}} slow, careful movement to unionize the industry.|$|E

Analyzing the proportions of dominant and recessive offspring determines if <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>in</b> question is homozygous dominant or heterozygous. If all offspring from the test cross display the dominant phenotype, <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>in</b> question is homozygous dominant; if half the offspring display dominant phenotypes and half display recessive phenotypes, then <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> is heterozygous. Since <b>the</b> homozygous recessive <b>individual</b> can only pass on recessive alleles, <b>the</b> alleles <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>in</b> question passes on determine the phenotypes of the offspring.

25|$|The {{number and}} initial strata of the vacancy chains created {{influence}} the career possibilities of <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>in</b> the internal labor market and those about to enter. The more chains initiated at higher levels, the more mobility opportunities for individuals throughout the system, as the chains move downward, {{and the greater}} {{the speed with which}} individuals advance to high status or large units and positions. On the other hand, if chains are mostly initiated at lower levels, individuals already in high status positions will see their careers plateau while only those at lower levels will move comparatively quickly before they reach a career bottleneck caused by the lack of opportunities at higher levels.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} {{research}} on the social loafing effect began in 1913 with Max Ringelmann's study. He found that when he asked {{a group of men}} to pull on a rope, that they did not pull as hard collectively as they did when each was pulling alone. This research did not distinguish whether this was the result of <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>in</b> a group putting in less effort or of poor coordination within the group. In 1974, Alan Ingham, James Graves, and colleagues replicated Ringelmann's experiment using two types of group: 1) Groups with real participants in groups of various sizes (consistent with Ringelmann's setup) or 2) Pseudo-groups with only one real participant. In the pseudo-groups, the researchers' assistants only pretended to pull on the rope.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>in</b> each colony {{can usually}} be {{separated}} into three groups: on the nest, next to the nest, or absent from the nest. Those {{who are on the}} nest usually consist of the dominant reproductive female, queens, and those caring for the brood or taking care of the nest. If more than one reproducing female is present in a nest, the less dominant one either stays on a smaller comb or remains next to the nest {{out of the way of}} the dominant individual. Non-reproductive individuals can reside in all three groups, but they usually remain either next to the nest or absent from the nest foraging for food. If they are on the nest, the dominants often force these subordinates onto smaller combs.|$|E

25|$|The Revolution in Haiti did {{not wait}} on the Revolution in France. <b>The</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>in</b> Haiti relied on no other {{resolution}} but their own. The call for modification of society {{was influenced by the}} revolution in France, but once the hope for change found a place in the hearts of the Haitian people, there was no stopping the radical reformation that was occurring. The Enlightenment ideals and the initiation of the French Revolution were enough to inspire the Haitian Revolution, which evolved into the most successful and comprehensive slave rebellion. Just as the French were successful in transforming their society, so were the Haitians. On April 4, 1792, The French National Assembly granted freedom to slaves in Haiti and the revolution culminated in 1804; Haiti was an independent nation solely of freed peoples. The activities of the revolutions sparked change across the world. France's transformation was most influential in Europe, and Haiti's influence spanned across every location that continued to practice slavery. John E. Baur honors Haiti as home of the most influential Revolution in history.|$|E
25|$|Led by the {{minister}} of the First Christian Church, the Klan represented a rising group of politically oriented non-ethnic Germans who denounced the elite as corrupt, undemocratic and self-serving. The historian Christopher Cocoltchos says the Klansmen tried to create a model, orderly community. The Klan had about 1200 members in Orange County, California. The economic and occupational profile of the pro and anti-Klan groups shows the two were similar and about equally prosperous. Klan members were Protestants, as were most of their opponents, but the latter also included many Catholic Germans. Individuals who joined the Klan had earlier demonstrated a much higher rate of voting and civic activism than did their opponents. Cocoltchos suggests that many of <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>in</b> Orange County joined the Klan out of that sense of civic activism. The Klan representatives easily won the local election in Anaheim in April 1924. They fired known city employees who were Catholic {{and replaced them with}} Klan appointees. The new city council tried to enforce prohibition. After its victory, the Klan chapter held large rallies and initiation ceremonies over the summer.|$|E
25|$|Among <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>in</b> Japan {{after their}} 1945 {{surrender}} was Lieutenant Colonel Murray Sanders, {{who arrived in}} Yokohama via the American ship Sturgess in September 1945. Sanders was a highly regarded microbiologist {{and a member of}} America's military center for biological weapons. Sanders' duty was to investigate Japanese biological warfare activity. At the time of his arrival in Japan he had no knowledge of what Unit 731 was. Until Sanders finally threatened the Japanese with bringing communism into the picture, little information about biological warfare was being shared with the Americans. The Japanese wanted to avoid the Soviet legal system so the next morning after the threat Sanders received a manuscript describing Japan's involvement in biological warfare. Sanders took this information to General Douglas MacArthur, who was the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers responsible for rebuilding Japan during the Allied occupations. MacArthur struck a deal with Japanese informantsâ€”he secretly granted immunity to the physicians of Unit 731, including their leader, in exchange for providing America, but not the other wartime allies, with their research on biological warfare and data from human experimentation. American occupation authorities monitored the activities of former unit members, including reading and censoring their mail. The U.S. believed that the research data were valuable. The U.S. did not want other nations, particularly the Soviet Union, to acquire data on biological weapons.|$|E

Of the fourteen individuals, five are members of the Chippewa Cree tribe on the Rocky Boy Indian Reservation in Montana and are associated with the Team Redskins Rodeo club. Two are Mike Wetzel and Don Wetzel, Jr. (Blackfeet), descendants of the logo designer, and the six others are members of various tribes and state that they are fans of the team and find nothing wrong with the name, or think it is positive.

500|$|Prior to the finals, the Lithuanian {{media outlet}} 15 min {{released}} an undercover video suggesting that representatives from Azerbaijan {{were trying to}} bribe Lithuanians for votes in the tele/smsvoting. The video detailed the plan, which involved recruiting groups of 10 people each, and supplying them with SIM cards so they could vote multiple times during the voting window in the tele/smsvoting. It was also suggested that similar activity was taking place {{in a total of}} 15 countries including Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, Ukraine, Croatia and Switzerland. In response to the allegations, Executive Supervisor Jon Ola Sand reaffirmed the contest's commitment to a [...] "fair and transparent result." [...] He stated that while Eurovision organisers were looking into the case, they [...] " [...] that the intention of these individuals have not yet been clarified, and nor has a link been established between <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>in</b> the video and the Azeri delegation, the Azeri act or the Azeri EBU member Ictimai TV." [...] He added that, since 1998, when he was first involved with the contest, [...] "every year there are rumors about irregularities in the voting".|$|E
500|$|Economic {{geographer}} Richard Florida came {{to prominence}} when he popularized {{the concept of}} a creative class, or a subset of individuals whose work involves creativity and innovation. [...] Florida's previous three books, The Rise of the Creative Class (2002), Cities and the Creative Class (2005), and The Flight of the Creative Class (2005), link the creative class with wealth generation and argue that <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>in</b> the creative class choose to locate in places with strong cultural and recreational activities, as well as an interesting nightlife. [...] Cities that have offered those activities have attracted innovative people, and despite high land and labor costs, businesses have chosen to re-locate to those areas in order to access them. With the success of his creative class theories, Florida founded a consulting firm, called the Creative Class Group, to advise local governments and other organizations about how to attract creative and innovative people. Florida, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College in Pittsburgh until 2005, wrote his next book, Who's Your City?, after moving to George Mason University's School of Public Policy. By the time he agreed to move to the University of Toronto he was deemed an [...] "academic pop star". Upon his arrival, he was personally greeted by the mayor of Toronto and the premier of Ontario. [...] Articles in the National Post and Toronto Star heralded his move, an article appeared in the magazine Style at Home featuring his new house, and he was given a regular column in the Globe & Mail.|$|E
