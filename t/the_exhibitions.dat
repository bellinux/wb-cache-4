5|$|The Museum {{building}} {{consists of}} a three-level base building that is {{closed to the public}} and provides staff workspace and storage areas. Five public, two-story towers on the base are called the North, East, South, West and <b>the</b> <b>Exhibitions</b> Pavilions. <b>The</b> <b>Exhibitions</b> Pavilion acts as the temporary residence for traveling art collections and the Foundation's artwork for which the permanent pavilions have no room. The permanent collection is displayed throughout the other four pavilions chronologically: the north houses the oldest art while the west houses the newest. The first-floor galleries in each pavilion house light-sensitive art, such as illuminated manuscripts, furniture, or photography. Computer-controlled skylights on the second-floor galleries allow paintings to be displayed in natural light. The second floors are connected by a series of glass-enclosed bridges and open terraces, both of which offer views of the surrounding hillsides and central plaza. Sculpture is also on display at various points outside the buildings, including on various terraces and balconies. The lower level (the highest of the floors in the base) includes a public cafeteria, the terrace cafe, and the photography galleries.|$|E
5|$|Meier has {{exploited}} the two naturally-occurring ridges (which diverge at a 22.5 degree angle) by overlaying two grids along these axes. These grids serve {{to define the}} space of the campus while dividing the import of the buildings on it. Along one axis lie the galleries and along the other axis lie the administrative buildings. Meier emphasized the two competing grids by constructing strong view lines through the campus. The main north-south axis starts with the helipad, then includes a narrow walkway between the auditorium and north buildings, continues past the elevator kiosk to the tram station, through the rotunda, past the walls and support columns of <b>the</b> <b>exhibitions</b> pavilion, and finally the ramp besides the west pavilion and the central garden. Its corresponding east-west visual axis starts with the edge of the scholar's wing of the Getty Research Institute (GRI), the walkway between the central garden and the GRI, the overlook to the azalea pool in the central garden, the walkway between the central garden and the west pavilion, and finally the north wall of the west pavilion and the courtyard between the south and east pavilions.|$|E
5|$|The main axes of {{the museum}} grid that is offset by 22.5 degrees begins with the arrival plaza, carries through {{the edge of the}} stairs up to the main entrance, aligns with the columns {{supporting}} the rotunda as well as the center point of the rotunda, aligns with travertine benches in the courtyard between the pavilions, includes a narrow walkway between the west and south pavilions, a staircase down to the cactus garden and ends in the garden. The corresponding cross axis starts with the center point of the circle forming the GRI library garden, then passing {{to the center of the}} entrance rotunda, and aligning with the south wall of the rotunda building. Although all of the Museum is aligned on these alternative axes, portions of <b>the</b> <b>exhibitions</b> pavilion and the east pavilion are aligned on the true north-south axis as a reminder that both grids are present in the campus.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>exhibition</b> venue was in North Hagley Park, a {{location}} considered ideal {{because of the}} available open space for <b>the</b> <b>exhibition</b> buildings and its proximity to transport links.

50|$|In April 2009 {{the museum}} began to display <b>the</b> <b>exhibition</b> “Body Worlds”, which uses human bodies which were donated {{for use in}} <b>the</b> <b>exhibition.</b> <b>The</b> opening of <b>the</b> <b>exhibition</b> was {{accompanied}} by a public protest, among others by Rabbi Yona Metzger, Chief Rabbi of Israel at the time, who claimed <b>the</b> <b>exhibition</b> was offending <b>the</b> deceased. <b>The</b> <b>exhibition</b> was displayed at MadaTech until January 4, 2010.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the making and}} {{experiencing}} of <b>the</b> <b>exhibition</b> “Sundi Mongo – A village in Congo” is examined through ethnographical interviews with former and present employees at the Museum of Ethnography in Stockholm. The interviews, together with archive material concerning <b>the</b> <b>exhibition,</b> are analyzed with discourse theory {{in order to examine}} how discourses of defining Africa construct application and interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>exhibition</b> pieces. A significant element is dislocation, where <b>the</b> <b>exhibition</b> has been standing since 1983 and the meaning of <b>the</b> <b>exhibition</b> is now expressed as changed. This change of meaning is connected to <b>the</b> change of <b>exhibition</b> ideals and changes in the perception of <b>the</b> <b>exhibition</b> model; a real village called Sundi Mongo, located in southwestern Congo. Change and continuity also concerns interpretations of the museum’s cooperation with the Swedish Missionary Association and affective practices surrounding <b>the</b> <b>exhibition</b> pieces and objects in the museum’s collections. The construction of interpretations of <b>the</b> <b>exhibition</b> pieces and objects are also analyzed with the concept of fantasy...|$|R
5|$|In 2003, Madonna {{collaborated with}} {{photographer}} Steven Klein for an art installation project called X-Static Process. The installation portrayed Madonna in different incarnations of her spiritual practices– from yogi, prophet, queen to freak and pole dancer. The publication was a worldwide success, {{leading to a}} number of exhibitions in New York, London, Paris, Düsseldorf, Berlin and Florence. After the exhibition was over, Madonna was inspired by the images from <b>the</b> <b>exhibitions</b> and decided to incorporate them into her then unplanned tour and asked Klein to help her with the task. She then began developing her sixth concert tour called Re-Invention World Tour. The poster released for the tour used one of the images from the installation project. It featured Madonna in a seventeenth-century-style dress, crawling on all fours towards the camera. The central theme of the show was unity versus violence. It was divided into five acts with different themes: French Baroque-Marie Antionette Revival, Military-Army, Circus-Cabaret, Acoustic and Scottish-Tribal segments. During the Q Awards, Elton John accused Madonna for lip-synching in her shows which gained great controversy but was denied by Madonna's representatives. Although musician Prince's Musicology Live 2004ever tour was initially projected to be the highest grossing tour of 2004, Billboard Boxscore published that the Re-Invention Tour had sold 55 out of the 56 shows and grossed $125 million. At the 2004 Billboard Touring Awards, Re-Invention Tour received the Top Tour while Madonna's tour manager Caresse Henry was awarded the Top Manager award. A documentary, titled I'm Going to Tell You a Secret, which chronicled the tour, was released in 2005.|$|E
