Some commentators criticized the use of harsh political rhetoric in the United States, with a number blaming <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>right</b> wing for the shooting; in particular, Sarah Palin was criticized for a poster by her political action committee that featured stylized crosshairs on an electoral map. Palin rejected claims that she bore responsibility for the shooting, and others defended her by noting that Loughner hated all politicians regardless of their affiliation.

40|$|For my {{undergraduate}} research, I evaluated {{what factors}} influenced a nation’s <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> score {{as determined by}} the international organization, Freedom House. I conducted this study by developing a multiple regression analysis through Pollock’s Political Analysis SPSS output. The data set contained <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> scores of 114 different nations. I focused on five major indicators in my analysis of <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> including: <b>the</b> ethno-linguistic heterogeneity of a country, the feelings of each country 2 ̆ 7 s population towards religion, the economic development of a nation, the percentage of the a country 2 ̆ 7 s population that is rural, and whether the country awarded women 2 ̆ 7 s suffrage before or after 1920. The model has an R Square of. 779, which means that the independent variables explain 78 percent of the variation in <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> scores of nations around the world. Other tests confirmed that each of the five independent variables were effective in determining the variation within the dependent variable. Each of my original hypotheses were confirmed by analysis. The model revealed that all other things being equal, as a particular country’s ethno-linguistic hetereogeneity increased, <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> score decreased; as the percentage of country’s population that viewed religion as “very important” increased, <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> score decreased; as the economic development of a country increased, <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> score increased, as the percentage of a country’s population that was rural increased, <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> score decreased and if a nation awarded women’s suffrage before 1920 it would have a higher <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> score than if suffrage had been awarded after 1920.

The conservatives planned a monarchist political system, with a lesser role for Parliament. A section of the conservatives had always supported monarchy and opposed democracy; others approved parliamentarianism since the revolutionary reform of 1906, but after the crisis of 1917-1918 concluded, that empowering the common people would not work. Social liberals and reformist non-socialists opposed any restriction of parliamentarianism. They initially resisted German military help, but the prolonged warfare changed their stance.|$|E

In this election, <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>right</b> in general had a great upturn, which garnered the Progress Party increased support. The ideology of the party was sharpened in the 1980s, and the party officially declared {{that it was a}} libertarian party at its national convention in Sandefjord in 1983. Until then, the party had not had a clearly defined ideology. In the campaign for the 1985 parliamentary election the party attacked many aspects of the Norwegian welfare state, and campaigned for privatization of medical care, education and government-owned enterprises, as well as steep cuts in income tax. In the election, the party lost two of its four members of parliament, but was left with some power as they became the kingmaker. In May 1986, the party used this position to effectively throw the governing Conservative-led government after it had proposed to increase gas taxes. A minority Labour government was established as a result.|$|E

25|$|In 1983–1984, however, {{approximately}} 90 employees {{left the}} newspaper after a rift over Becerra Acosta's management style.

They were also angry that Becerra Acosta reportedly accepted a loan from the government to help Unomásuno through its financial difficulties. In their eyes, Unomásuno was sacrificing its autonomy by accepting the government's help. The defectors of Unomásuno, headed by journalists Payán, Lira Saade, Miguel Ángel Granados Chapa, Héctor Aguilar Camín, and Ricardo Alemán, formed a competing daily newspaper known as La Jornada on September 19, 1984.
