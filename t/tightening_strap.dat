50|$|After {{cleaning}} {{the sample of}} any mud or dirt, {{the next step is}} to press the sample. It should be noted some samples may press better if they have been left to wilt for a few days. However plants should never be allowed to spoil or decompose before pressing, as this will impact the quality of the dried product. Plant presses are most commonly constructed with two flat smooth pieces of wood, and some type of compression mechanism. Compression may be accomplished with tightened nuts and bolts on the corners of the press, with <b>tightened</b> <b>straps</b> around the press, or by placing weights on top of the press. When placing in the press, plant samples should be sandwiched between a few layers of absorbent blotter. Newspaper and cardboard are two common choices for blotter material. When arranging the plant in the press it is important to remember that the dried plant product will be fragile and inflexible, so position the plant exactly as you wish the final product to appear. Tighten the press and wait approximately a day to check up on the plant. The blotter should be taken out and replaced with dry blotter roughly every 24 hours. Complete drying time will vary depending on the type of plant, but is generally 7-10 days. Fleshier plants such as succulents will take longer.|$|R

Berets made of camouflage cloth in the [...] "Duck hunter", [...] "Leopard", [...] "Tigerstripe" [...] and [...] "Highland" [...] patterns were also used in the field, particularly by elite units within the RLA and by the irregular SGU formations.According to the 1959 regulations, General Service and corps’ berets were worn with the standard RLA beret badge placed above the right eye. Issued in gilt metal for officers and in silver metal for the rank-and-file, it consisted of a trident, symbolizing the Hindu God Vishnu, superimposed on a spinning Buddhist [...] "Wheel of Law" [...] (Chakra) whose design recalled a circular saw.There were however exceptions to this rule, such as the Laotian airborne battalions who retained the silver winged dagger metal airborne beret badge modelled after the French pattern previously adopted in the early 1950s, simply replacing the dagger by a Laotian trident after 1961.|$|R

Gloves are designed to protect from extreme heat and various penetrating objects and to allow dexterity. Usually the latter is sacrificed to give adequate protection to heat and sharp objects. Newer gloves are more lightweight and don't lose their dexterity when they dry after becoming wet, the way leather gloves may.|$|R

Johnson had his harness straps on too loose, and wrenched his shoulders – revealing that his earlier rugby injury had not healed properly. The Spitfire did a ground loop, ripping {{off one of the}} undercarriage legs and forcing the other up through the port main plane. The commanding officer (CO) excused Johnson, for the [...] "short airfield" [...] was difficult to land on for an inexperienced pilot. Johnson got the impression, however, that he would be watched closely, and felt that if he made another mistake, he would be [...] "certainly washed out". Johnson tried to pack the injured shoulder with wool, held in place by adhesive tape. He also <b>tightened</b> the <b>straps</b> to reduce vibrations. Johnson found he had lost his [...] "feel" [...] in his right hand, and it became numb. When he practised dives, the pressure also aggravated his shoulder. He often tried to fly using his left hand only, but the Spitfire would have to be handled with both hands during anything other than simple manoeuvres. Despite the difficulties with his injuries, on 28 August 1940, the course was complete. Johnson had 205.25 hours on operational types including 23.50 on the Spitfire.|$|R

30|$|The Biodex system II {{dynamometer}} (Biodex medical, New York, N.Y., USA) {{was used}} to assess quadriceps endurance.

Quadriceps endurance test consisted of 12 maximal isometric knee extensions of the dominant leg. Contractions were held for 3  seconds, with a 5  second rest period between each repetition. A traffic light system on the computer screen and standardised verbal commands from the researcher ensured participants were contracting at the appropriate times. Endurance was assessed using the percentage fatigue index value, calculated by the 1 st peak torque (PT) minus the last (12 th) PT, divided by the 1 st PT multiplied by 100. In addition, the percentage change of torque (mean of last three repetitions/mean of first three repetitions) was computed (Nicolay and Walker 2005).|$|R

40|$|We {{performed}} {{a study on}} 32 idiopathic scoliotic patients (30 females, 2 males) treated with a Chêneau brace. Eighteen patients had a single right thoracic curve and 14 had a single right thoracolumbar curve. We used the TekScan 1 system (ClinSeat Type 5315 Sensor, TekScan, Boston MA, USA) to measure pressures at the skin-brace interface, assess the effect of strap tension and analyze the variation of these pressures with position and activity. The TekScan 1 device enabled identification of the pressure areas corresponding to the brace’s three loading points. The pressure under the main pad had a greater mean value than the pressure under the two counter-pads. <b>Tightening</b> the <b>straps</b> led to {{a significant increase in}} the pressures, whatever the position studied or the curve pattern. Compared with the standing (reference) position, we observed significantly higher pressures during maximal inspiration (p 5 0. 001) and lower pressures during maximal expiration, in the prone position and after having risen from a lying position, for both thoracic curves (p 5 0. 001) and thoracolumbar curves (p 5 0. 01). The pressures for thoracolumbar curves were lower than those for thoracic curves, whatever the position studied and both before and after strap adjustment. For lying positions, lying on the right side produced the greatest increase pressure. Even though the TekScan 1 system does not provide direct information on the correction of spinal curvature, it appears to be a useful tool in the treatment of scoliotic patients. Strap adjustment clearly influences the applied pressures – particularly those on the rib cage. During activity, there is a natural tendency to decrease the pressure; this justifies efforts to maintain strap tensions in general and during day wear in particular...|$|R

40|$|Background: In {{emergencies}} when commercially de-signed tourniquets are unavailable, hemorrhage {{may need}} to be controlled with improvised tourniquets. In the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing, no im-provised strap-and-windlass tourniquets were used to treat casualties; tourniquets without windlasses were used. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to determine the effectiveness of improvised tourniquets with and without a windlass to better understand the role of the windlass in <b>tightening</b> the tourniquet <b>strap.</b> Methods: An experiment was designed to test the effectiveness of im-provised strap-and-windlass tourniquets fashioned out of a tee shirt on a manikin thigh. Two users conducted 40 tests each with and without the use of a windlass. Re-sults: Without a windlass, improvised tourniquets failed to stop bleeding in 99 % of tests (79 of 80 tests). With a windlass, improvised tourniquets failed to stop bleeding in 32 % of tests (p <. 0001). In tests with no windlass, at-tempts to stop the pulse completely failed (100 %, 80 of 80 tests). With a windlass, however, attempts to stop the pulse failed 31 % of the time (25 of 80 tests); the differ-ence in proportions was significant (p <. 0001). Conclu-sions: Improvised strap-and-windlass tourniquets were more effective than those with no windlass, as a wind-lass allowed the user to gain mechanical advantage.

Hughes added curved structural steel rods that were sewn into the brassiere under each breast cup. The rods were connected to the bra's shoulder straps. The arrangement allowed the breasts to be pulled upward and {{made it possible to}} move the shoulder straps away from the neck. The design allowed for a larger amount of bosom to be exposed. Contrary to many media reports afterward, Russell did not wear the bra during filming. According to her 1988 autobiography, she said the bra was so uncomfortable that she secretly discarded it. She wrote that the [...] "ridiculous" [...] contraption hurt so much that she wore it only a few minutes.
