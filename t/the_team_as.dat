5|$|According to critics, the {{inherent}} {{problem with this}} approach is that it relied heavily upon an assumption that Michelangelo only painted buon fresco, that he was always satisfied with the result {{at the end of the}} day, and that in four and a half years spent on the ceiling, he stuck exclusively to one approach, and never made small alterations or added details. Arguimbau, on his website, quotes Colalucci, the head of <b>the</b> <b>team,</b> <b>as</b> contradicting himself on this matter.|$|E

While remaining head coach at Iowa State, he coached Cornell to records of 5–3–1 in 1897 and 10–2 in 1898; in the latter season, Cornell outscored its opponents 296–29. Despite its 1898 success, tension existed within <b>the</b> <b>team,</b> <b>as</b> its assistant coach (backed by {{a large proportion of}} the players) lobbied to replace Warner. Acknowledging an issue with his leadership, Warner resigned.|$|E

5|$|Alec Coxon took match {{figures of}} 4/113 for Yorkshire against Australia, taking four middle-order wickets, and scored 21 and 16 not {{out in the}} middle-order. He came into <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>as</b> an all-rounder, even though his {{performances}} {{during the rest of}} the English season had been mediocre; he had a batting average of 20.25 for the summer and took only ten wickets in seven matches prior to the county fixture against Australia. Bowes saw him as an attacking bowler compatible with Robins's strategic thinking.|$|E
5|$|Australia's {{prospects}} improved after Sweden was disqualified in {{the morning}} heats.

In 1983, Henderson married his high-school sweetheart, Pamela. They have three children: Angela, Alexis, and Adrianna.|$|E
