5|$|Waller {{was also}} {{involved}} in matters related the local railroads. On October 3, 1877, he sold some of his land in Bloomsburg to the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad {{for the purpose of}} a new railroad station. He was {{also involved in}} the building of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>and</b> <b>West</b> Branch Railway between 1880 and 1881. He started raising money for this railroad in 1872 and broke the ground for the railroad in March 1872. Waller put most of his money into the building of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>and</b> <b>West</b> Branch Railway. The work on the railroad stopped during the Panic of 1873 but resumed in 1880. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>and</b> <b>West</b> Branch Railway Company was sold in 1881 but he managed to regain much of the company. The company was leased to the Pennsylvania Railroad on November 23, 1881, but remained its own company for approximately 20 years. He was president of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>and</b> <b>West</b> Branch Railway in the 1880s. In 1888, he sold a piece of land to the town of Bloomsburg for the purpose of building the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad through it. It was he who initially conceived the idea of the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad. Waller also successfully convinced the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad to move its Bloomsburg station to his land on Market Street.|$|E

The stables and <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>and</b> <b>west</b> sides of the castle were {{protected}} by another, smaller curtain wall, but this is now largely ruined. Accounts suggest that the original stables could hold around 60horses, although by the 17th century they had been expanded to accommodate more.|$|E

The lack of mutually agreed borders in this area led to several international conflicts, from the Cisplatine War to the Paraguayan War.|$|E

5|$|Between his {{coronation}} and 1071, William consolidated {{his hold}} over England, defeating {{a number of}} rebellions that arose particularly in <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>and</b> <b>west</b> of the country. Immediately after Hastings, only those English noblemen who fought in the battle lost their lands, which were distributed to Normans and others from the continent who had supported William's invasion. The rebellions of the years 1068 to 1071 led to fresh confiscations of English land, again distributed to William's continental followers. By 1086, when William ordered the compilation of Domesday Book to record landholders in England, most of the native English nobility {{had been replaced by}} Norman and other continental nobles.|$|E
