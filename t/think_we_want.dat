2500|$|The Discovery Institute {{continues}} to deny allegations that its true agenda is religious, and downplays the religious source {{of much of}} its funding. In an interview of Stephen C. Meyer when ABC News asked about the Discovery Institute's many evangelical Christian donors the institute's public relations representative stopped the interview saying [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to go down that path." ...|$|E
2500|$|Barbara Alyn Woods portrays Deb Scott, Dan's {{wife and}} Nathan's mother. Initially normal, she later becomes neurotic. Woods said, [...] "She's fun to play, I love Deb Scott, she's a well-rounded character. I can't say I'm {{a lot like}} her, but I think our desires are the same. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to be career women and good moms– I hope I'm a bit more {{successful}} than she is." [...] Explaining their differences, Woods added, [...] "I've never done any drugs in my whole life, I've never even smoked a cigarette– that's where I'd start– lay off the drugs. I'm not a big drinker, so I'd lay off the booze. So, {{that would be a}} good start for a mom I would say. And I've never cheated on my husband." [...] Seventeen years of marriage to Dan have made Deb bitter, and she divorces him in season 3, her hatred of him once driving her to try to kill him. Deb battles an addiction to pills in season 2 and again in season 4, but overcomes it permanently the second time.|$|E
2500|$|... "Get Along" [...] {{deals with}} the damage inflicted by religious, racial and {{cultural}} intolerance, asking why the world can't just get along. It is a stripped back track with minimal instrumental accompaniment. Sebastian explained why he wrote the song, [...] "It sends your brain into overload when you are expecting your first child. It definitely makes you {{take a step back}} and try to gain some perspective on this world we live in". [...] "Big Bad World" [...] was written for his son Hudson who was born in March 2012. He said, [...] "It's about that promise we all make to our kids, but realise we don't have as much control as we <b>think.</b> <b>We</b> <b>want</b> to protect them from the big bad world, but the promise matters the most." [...] "Used to You" [...] is a song Sebastian wrote for his wife Jules. He said, [...] "I always say to her, 'I don't get used to you'. I still get back from tours and I'm still excited to see her. [...] We've been friends for 18 years, together for 13 years. I'm lucky".|$|E

5000|$|I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to portray}} {{a sort of}} [...] "we are guilty before we even release the album" [...] in regards to all the {{censorship}} and musicians blamed for violent crime.... Anders Bjöler ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hi, old fossil," [...] {{cried the}} man who had first called on him for assistance, [...] "did je <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> of you to read the bloomin' notis to yourself? Come back here and read it out loud, you old barnacle." ...|$|R
2500|$|In November 2010, General Richards {{said there}} was no desire to [...] "open up another front" [...] in the Middle East but {{suggested}} that in future it [...] "might be" [...] necessary. David Cameron told Parliament that Britain would [...] "take every step to cut out the terrorist cancer that lurks in the Arabian Peninsula", but Gen Richards said an intelligence-led approach was the current strategy. Richards added: [...] "Clearly, the primary agencies dealing with this are our intelligence and security agencies. But the military are already helping with their [...] training. I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to open up another front there and nor do the Yemenis want us to do that. So we have to find other ways of doing these things and in the meantime making sure Afghanistan doesn't revert to becoming, if you like, a 'second Yemen' – that is the Army's primary duty at the moment. Our role is to remain very close to them, to help them where they most need it and in the meanwhile focus our efforts on Afghanistan and assisting Pakistan to ensure they don't become the threat Yemen is beginning to be.|$|E
2500|$|Producer Eric Fellner {{attempted}} to convince Pitt {{to remain in}} the film, but Pitt was in disagreement with the studio over changes that had been made to the script since he originally agreed to star. Talent agency CAA (which represents Pitt) maintained that he never signed off on the changes; Macdonald delayed filming by a week to perform a scene-by-scene review of the script with Pitt; by the end, the director told the actor [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to make the same film." [...] When Pitt decided {{to drop out of the}} film he called the director himself to say so. Pitt preferred a version closer to the original Carnahan draft and wanted to postpone filming until after the resolution of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, which would have enabled a further rewrite. The studio preferred to press on with production, and initially said it was to sue Pitt for reneging on his [...] "pay or play" [...] deal, which would have earned him $20million. Settlement talks later led to a thawing of relations between the parties. Pitt later said of the situation: [...] "I had definite beliefs of what [...] should be, and the director had his definite beliefs [...] we got up against this writers' strike where we couldn't fuse the two." ...|$|E

5000|$|Kylie {{spoke about}} the novel, saying [...] "The fans seem to love it. That’s why we did it, characters' names are Lexi and Livia. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to make Lex more like me and Livia more like Kendall, {{and they kind of}} evolved into their own characters." ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{was on that}} tour Thin Lizzy that we {{realized}} there was really a lack of just straight up rock and roll records coming out these days. So I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to make something that was, front to back, a very focused kind of a recording. A very efficient kind of recording. One that had good energy {{from the very beginning}} to the end.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> shall <b>want</b> {{anything}} else," [...] {{she said}} with a serenity that cost her an effort, though it was excellently assumed.|$|R

6000|$|... "He did, did he?" [...] said Dockwrath, {{rising from}} his chair and {{clapping}} his hands. [...] "Very well. I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> shall <b>want</b> more than that, Mr. Mason." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] Charlotte {{instantly}} said, [...] "isn't it for us, only, to do that?" [...] She {{spoke as}} with a flare of pride for their privilege and their duty. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> no one's aid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, my hearties," [...] said I. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> {{a little}} recreation. And now let's turn in, for {{we ought to}} be off by dawn, and then perhaps we may catch them feeding before they move on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll have to {{be careful}} how we write home about it," [...] cautioned his cousin. [...] "If we aren't, they'll <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> them to come just on account of Ruth and May, and then they'll tease the life out of us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> shall <b>want</b> that; {{there is}} a sort of thin blue light, the {{reflection}} of the light upon the water outside, though I don't know why it should be so blue." ...|$|R
5000|$|That’s more of {{a comment}} on America {{as a whole and}} television's {{standards}} and practices than it is on us. It is kind of absurd that in an episode where you see the inside of a bloated, water-logged corpse, you can't see so much as a butt cheek. That's the world we’re living in. But I think it's important to view the relationship between Maggie and Glenn in a certain light. I don’t <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to turn that into some kind of steamy, pornographic sex romp. Robert Kirkman ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is cheaper, I know," [...] said Mr. Holiday; [...] "but then {{as to the}} talking, I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> shall <b>want</b> to be quiet, and go {{to sleep}} if we can. You see it will be night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O no, no, no, dearest mamma: {{nothing can}} be dull with you," [...] cried Henrietta, wishing most {{sincerely}} to undo her own work. [...] "We are, indeed we are, as happy as the day is long. Do not fancy we are discontented; do not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> a change." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> more {{evidence}} of a change. The vice-chancellor and myself went down to a place we have near town, on Saturday, {{where there is a}} very nice piece of water; indeed, some people call it a lake; but it was quite frozen, and my boys wanted to skate, but that I would not permit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> {{the things}} that you've got," [...] said Janet. A phrase one of the orators had used came into her mind, [...] "Enough money {{to live up to}} American standards"--but she did not repeat it. [...] "Enough money to be free, to enjoy life, to have some leisure and {{amusement}} and luxury." [...] The last three she took from the orator's mouth.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder what}} the matter is with him?" [...] Fred asked, when, at a late hour, the {{partners}} were alone. [...] "Do you suppose he <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> don't <b>want</b> to see him just {{because we have been}} fortunate?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} of the album was recorded at guitarist Dan Hawkins's home, Leeders Farm, in Norfolk. Discussing the album {{in comparison to the}} band's previous two studio albums, Permission to Land and One Way Ticket to Hell... and Back, drummer Ed Graham noted: [...] "I <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> all feel that the second Darkness album is a bit over produced and maybe lost its way in places, a bit. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to return to the form we were in; <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to make something that was more like Permission to Land than the second album. There are a couple of songs on this new album that are actually really old songs that we played ten years ago when we first formed." ...|$|R

60|$|I do not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> {{to get rid}} of patriotism, and I do {{not think}} we could, even if we wanted to do so. It seems to be {{necessary}} to his moral life, that a man should feel himself part of a community, belonging to it, and it belonging to him. And that this community should be a single and lovable reality, inspired by a common idea, with a common fashion and aim.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let's {{be generous}} to them," [...] whispered Shep to his chums. [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to stay after the circus people {{come for the}} lion and the chimpanzee." [...] And after some talking the young hunters offered the Spink crowd part of their food {{supplies}} {{and a few other}} things. This surprised Ham, Carl and the rest. They accepted the offer on the spot, and a better feeling prevailed between the boys than had for many months.|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen, my friend," [...] he said, [...] "there are no {{such things}} as allies. An {{alliance}} between two countries is a dead letter so soon as their interests cease to be identical. Now Austria is our ally because she is practically Germany. We are both mid-Continental Powers. We both need the same protection. But England and France! Go back only fifty years, my dear Hunterleys, and ask yourself--would any living person, living now and alive then, believe in the lasting nature of such an unnatural alliance? Wherever you look, in every quarter of the globe, your interests are opposed. You robbed France of Egypt. She can't have wholly forgotten. You dominate the Mediterranean through Gibraltar, Malta, and Cyprus. What does she think of that, I wonder? Isn't a humiliation for her when she does stop to think of it? You've a thousand years of quarrels, of fighting and rapine behind you. You can't call yourselves allies because the thing isn't natural. It never could be. It was only your mutual, hysterical fear of Germany which drove you into one another's arms. We fought France once to prove ourselves, and for money. Just now we don't want either money or territory from France. Perhaps we don't even want, my dear Englishman, what you <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>want,</b> but all the same, don't blame us for trying to dissolve an unnatural alliance. Was that Simpson who came by the Luxe this morning?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Unlike the band's {{previous}} two studio albums, Something for the Weakened does not feature any electronica elements, with Pennycook noting that his Macbook broke prior to recording, and that [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> all <b>wanted</b> {{to move towards}} something which had a more human element to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{it would}} be as well, while you are about it, to bring eight. You may as well get some more coffee. We drink a lot of that, and like it strong. If your wife <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> shall <b>want</b> more sugar, or {{anything}} else, by all means get some." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> really <b>wanted</b> to be Kraftwerk.” William Cashion stated to Star News Online - January 13, 2005. It {{was through}} Kraftwerk's Trans-Europe Express which was sampled by Afrika Bambaataa that Cashion and Herring found some common ground when forming the Kraftwerk-influenced Art Lord & the Self-Portraits. They explained: ...|$|R
