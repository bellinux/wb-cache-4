5|$|Egyptian texts take {{different}} views {{on whether the}} gods are responsible when humans suffer unjustly. Misfortune was often seen {{as a product of}} isfet, the cosmic disorder that was the opposite of maat, and therefore the gods were not guilty of causing evil events. Some deities who were closely connected with isfet, such as Set, could be blamed for disorder within the world without placing guilt on the other gods. But some writings do accuse the deities of causing human misery, while others give theodicies in the gods' defense. Beginning in the Middle Kingdom, several texts connected the issue of evil in the world with a myth in which the creator god fights a human rebellion against his rule and then withdraws from the earth. Because of this human misbehavior, the creator is distant from his creation, allowing suffering to exist. New Kingdom writings do not question the just nature of the gods as strongly as those of the Middle Kingdom. <b>They</b> <b>emphasize</b> humans' direct, personal relationships with deities and the gods' power to intervene in human events. People in this era put faith in specific gods who they hoped would help and protect them through their lives. As a result, upholding the ideals of maat grew less important than gaining the gods' favor as a way to guarantee a good life. Even the pharaohs were regarded as dependent on divine aid, and after the New Kingdom came to an end, government was increasingly influenced by oracles communicating the gods' will.|$|E
25|$|Southern Baptist {{churches are}} evangelical in {{doctrine}} and practice. As <b>they</b> <b>emphasize</b> {{the significance of}} the individual conversion experience, which is affirmed by the person having complete immersion in water for a believer's baptism, they reject the practice of infant baptism. Other specific beliefs based on biblical interpretation can vary somewhat due to their congregational polity, which allows autonomy to each individual local church.|$|E
25|$|Schools of the Shanxi branch have a {{narrower}} stance, lighter footwork {{and tend to}} be more evasive. <b>They</b> <b>emphasize</b> the development of relaxation before the practice of intention (Yi). Schools of the Hebei branch emphasize Xing and Yi before developing a higher level of relaxed structure, and have a slightly different evasive footwork. Schools of the Henan branch are typically the most aggressive of the three.|$|E

25|$|Hot media usually, but not always, provide {{complete}} involvement without considerable stimulus. For example, print occupies visual space, uses visual senses, but can immerse its reader. Hot media favour analytical precision, {{quantitative analysis}} and sequential ordering, {{as they are}} usually sequential, linear and logical. <b>They</b> <b>emphasize</b> one sense (for example, of sight or sound) over the others. For this reason, hot media also include radio, as well as film, the lecture and photography.|$|E
25|$|The Lemba, a Bantu-speaking {{group of}} people from {{southern}} Africa, primarily Zimbabwe and South Africa, consider themselves of Jewish descent, although most practice Christianity or Islam. <b>They</b> <b>emphasize</b> eating only meats slaughtered by special ritual. They have endogamous marriage practices. If a man wants to marry a non-Lemba woman, she must adopt all the Lemba practices and traditions, including keeping meat and dairy foods separate. No male non-Lemba are accepted into the group, even by conversion.|$|E
25|$|Reading {{models can}} be {{classified}} by whether <b>they</b> <b>emphasize</b> on lexical processes (Reader, EMMA, E-Z Reader, SWIFT) or oculomotor control processes (Competition-Interaction Theory, SERIF). Models in the first group focus {{on the effect of}} relatively high-level cognitive processes like those on word frequency, word parsing or word predictability, while models in the second group focus on the more primitive mechanisms of oculomotor processes in reading such as how word length of currently fixated word and its neighbour words affect saccade amplitude and latency (or fixation duration).|$|E

50|$|In {{long-term}} perspective, the revolutions {{were mostly}} successful. They spread widely {{the ideals of}} republicanism, the overthrow of aristocracies, kings and established churches. <b>They</b> <b>emphasized</b> the universal ideals of The Enlightenment, such as the equality of all men. <b>They</b> <b>emphasized</b> equal justice under law by disinterested courts, as opposed to particular justice handed down at the whim of a local noble. They showed that the modern notion of revolution, of starting fresh with a radically new government, could actually work in practice. Revolutionary mentalities were born and continue to flourish to the present day.|$|R
25|$|Adding {{secondary}} {{actions to}} the main action gives a scene more life, and can help to support the main action. A person walking can simultaneously swing their arms or keep them in their pockets, speak or whistle, or express emotions through facial expressions. The important thing about secondary actions is that <b>they</b> <b>emphasize,</b> rather than take {{attention away from the}} main action. If the latter is the case, those actions are better left out. For example, during a dramatic movement, facial expressions will often go unnoticed. In these cases it is better to include them at {{the beginning and the end}} of the movement, rather than during.|$|E
25|$|Proponents {{argue that}} nuclear {{power is a}} {{sustainable}} energy source which reduces carbon emissions and can increase energy security if its use supplants a dependence on imported fuels. Proponents advance the notion that nuclear power produces virtually no air pollution, {{in contrast to the}} chief viable alternative of fossil fuel. Proponents also believe that nuclear power is the only viable course to achieve energy independence for most Western countries. <b>They</b> <b>emphasize</b> that the risks of storing waste are small and can be further reduced by using the latest technology in newer reactors, and the operational safety record in the Western world is excellent when compared to the other major kinds of power plants.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, the University of Birmingham {{disclosed}} that scientific tests may show a Quran manuscript in its collection {{as one of}} the oldest known and believe it was written close to the time of Muhammad. Dr Saud al-Sarhan, Director of Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Riyadh, questions whether the parchment might have been reused as a palimpsest, and also noted that the writing had chapter separators and dotted verse endings – features in Arabic scripts which are believed not to have been introduced to the Qur'an until later. Dr Saud's criticisms was affirmed by several Saudi-based experts in Quranic history, who strongly rebut any speculation that the Birmingham/Paris Quran could have been written during the lifetime of the Prophet Muhammad. <b>They</b> <b>emphasize</b> that while Muhammad was alive, Quranic texts were written without chapter decoration, marked verse endings or use of coloured inks; and did not follow any standard sequence of surahs. They maintain that those features were introduced into Quranic practice in the time of the Caliph Uthman, and so the Birmingham leaves could have been written later, but not earlier.|$|E

500|$|The {{species was}} {{described}} as new to science in 1873 by Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis, from specimens collected in Wisconsin. In their short description, <b>they</b> <b>emphasize</b> the short pedicels (tube-like extensions) on the spores, and indicate that these pedicels—initially {{about as long as}} the spore is wide—soon break off. According to the nomenclatural authority MycoBank, taxonomic synonyms (i.e., having different type specimens) include Pier Andrea Saccardo's 1882 Bovista tabacina, Job Bicknell Ellis and Benjamin Matlack Everhart's 1885 Mycenastrum oregonense, and Andrew Price Morgan's 1892 Bovista montana. William Chambers Coker and John Nathaniel Couch called B.pila [...] "the American representative of B.nigrescens in Europe", referring to their close resemblance.|$|E
500|$|Rather than {{maintain}} {{the system of}} having scholars specialized in certain time periods and authors, Wellek and Warren push for scholars who have mastered certain approaches and thought patterns, preferably those who are from a literary background. They also recommend [...] "sharper distinction between {{the teacher and the}} scholar", allowing some individuals to devote their careers to research and not teaching. <b>They</b> <b>emphasize</b> a need for fluency in several modern languages rather than an understanding of the classical ones; this coincides with their urge to establish departments teaching comparative literature. They recommend the teaching of literary methods and theories in combination with periods and authors, with a retooling of the doctoral dissertation procedures.|$|E

50|$|Also, Ibn Kathir quoting hadiths from Sahih Bukhari and Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal {{states that}} the verse {{referred}} to Quraysh, because <b>they</b> <b>emphasized</b> that it was revealed at Mecca {{and at that time}} Ali was not married with Fatima.|$|R
500|$|Wellek and Warren's {{concept of}} {{aesthetics}} {{borrowed from the}} writings of Immanuel Kant, implying that a specific [...] "aesthetic realm" [...] was autonomous within the work and required a certain perspective to properly understand; <b>they</b> <b>emphasize</b> this with a quote from the neo-Kantian philosopher and literary critic Eliseo Vivas, that beauty is a [...] "character of some things... present only in the thing for those endowed with the capacity and the training through which alone it can be perceived". Meanwhile, their depiction of a dynamic scale of values, {{as opposed to an}} anarchical one, is a reimagining of perspectivism, which Wellek and Warren define as [...] "recogniz that there is one poetry, one literature, comparable in all ...|$|E
500|$|The {{questions}} of what defines film noir, {{and what sort}} of category it is, provoke continuing debate. [...] "We'd be oversimplifying things in calling film noir oneiric, strange, erotic, ambivalent, and cruel"—this set of attributes constitutes the first of many attempts to define film noir made by French critics Raymond Borde and Étienne Chaumeton in their 1955 book Panorama du film noir américain 1941–1953 (A Panorama of American Film Noir), the original and seminal extended treatment of the subject. <b>They</b> <b>emphasize</b> that not every film noir embodies all five attributes in equal measure—one might be more dreamlike; another, particularly brutal. The authors' caveats and repeated efforts at alternative definition have been echoed in subsequent scholarship: in the more than five decades since, there have been innumerable further attempts at definition, yet in the words of cinema historian Mark Bould, film noir remains an [...] "elusive phenomenon always just out of reach".|$|E

[...] The chapter entitled [...] "Origins of Lemurs" [...] ("Origin of the Lemurs" [...] in the third edition) briefly summarizes the theories on how lemurs came to Madagascar and the difficulty in resolving the mystery. [...] "Discovery and Study of the Living Lemurs" [...] reviews the history of exploration, field research, and taxonomic nomenclature of lemurs, starting from the 1625 description of a ring-tailed lemur to contemporary research by Western and Malagasy scientists. [...] "The Extinct Lemurs" [...] discusses the recently extinct subfossil lemurs, including the monkey lemurs, sloth lemurs, and koala lemurs. [...] "Conservation of Lemurs" [...] details the threats lemurs face, such as habitat destruction and hunting for bushmeat, [...] and conservation efforts aimed at their protection, from the in-situ and ex-situ programs of the Madagascar Fauna Group to the promise by Madagascar's former president Marc Ravalomanana to triple the country's protected areas over five years, known as the Durban Vision. [...] In the third edition, a new chapter was added, entitled [...] "Madagascar's Ancient Geological History", written by Maarten de Wit from the University of Cape Town. [...] In it, three billion years of geological and biological history are explored in detail.|$|E
