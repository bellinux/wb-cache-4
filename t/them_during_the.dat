5|$|About 185,000 Armenians {{lived in}} Vaspurakan. In {{the city of}} Van itself, there were around 30,000 Armenians, but more Armenians from {{surrounding}} villages joined <b>them</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman offensive.

The Dashnaktsutiun was also involved in other less-successful resistance movements in Zeitun, Shabin-Karahisar, Urfa, and Musa Dagh. After the end of the Van resistance, ARF leader Aram Manukian became governor of the Administration for Western Armenia and worked to ease the sufferings of Armenians.|$|E

Bohemund, who had set himself up as Prince of Antioch, briefly went to war with the Byzantines, but he agreed to become Alexios' vassal under the Treaty of Devol in 1108, which marked the end of the Norman threat during Alexios' reign.|$|E

The men then went on leave, after which they returned to Atherton where training was conducted before staging and departing again.|$|E

Shortly afterward he returned with a party of armed settlers from Bull's estate.|$|E
5|$|Plants face severe {{challenges}} in arid environments. Problems {{they need to}} solve include how to obtain enough water, how to avoid being eaten and how to reproduce. Photosynthesis {{is the key to}} plant growth. It can only take place during the day as energy from the sun is required, but during the day, many deserts become very hot. Opening stomata to allow in the carbon dioxide necessary for the process causes evapotranspiration, and conservation of water is a top priority for desert vegetation. Some plants have resolved this problem by adopting crassulacean acid metabolism, allowing them to open their stomata during the night to allow CO2 to enter, and close <b>them</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> day, or by using C4 carbon fixation.|$|E
