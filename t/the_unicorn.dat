5|$|The {{synopsis}} continues a plot {{begun in}} The Secret of <b>the</b> <b>Unicorn.</b>|$|E
5|$|While sailing in the West Indies in 1676, <b>the</b> <b>Unicorn,</b> {{commanded}} by Sir Francis Haddock, is seized and captured {{by a group}} of pirates led by Red Rackham. The pirates hoist a red pennant—no life would be spared. During the battle, Sir Francis is hit and loses consciousness. Later, the members of <b>the</b> <b>Unicorn</b> crew still alive are killed or thrown overboard. Sir Francis regains consciousness, finding himself tied to the mainmast. The pirate ship is damaged and sinking, so Red Rackham moves his treasure on board <b>the</b> <b>Unicorn.</b> The ship then sails to an uninhabited island. When anchored near the shore of the island, Sir Francis manages to free himself and goes below deck to <b>the</b> <b>Unicorn</b> gunpowder stores. Whilst there, he encounters Rackham for the final time, killing him in a sword fight. Before escaping in the ship's jolly boat, he is able to set fire to the gunpowder by means of a slow-burning fuse, causing <b>the</b> <b>Unicorn</b> (with Rackham's drunken crew and presumably Red Rackham's treasure still aboard) to explode and sink.|$|E

5|$|He {{also studied}} other vessels from the period, {{such as the}} Le Soleil Royal, La Couronne, La Royale and Le Reale de France, to better {{understand}} 17th-century ship design. It was from the Le Reale de France that he gained a basis for his design of <b>the</b> <b>Unicorn</b> jolly boat. No ship named <b>the</b> <b>Unicorn</b> was listed {{in the annals of}} the French Navy, but Hergé instead took the name from a British frigate which had been active in the mid-18th century; the fictional ship's unicorn figurehead was also adopted from the frigate.|$|E
5|$|In the Tintin adventures, <b>the</b> <b>Unicorn</b> is {{the setting}} of a battle between pirates and sailors {{followed}} by a duel between its captain, Sir Francis Haddock (an ancestor of Captain Haddock) and the pirate Red Rackham. <b>The</b> <b>Unicorn</b> is scuttled and sinks, only to be discovered years later by Tintin and his friends {{in an attempt to}} locate Red Rackham's treasure.|$|E
5|$|In {{the present}} day, Tintin, his dog Snowy, {{and his friends}} Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus follow {{coordinates}} that Sir Francis had left his three sons in a strange riddle hidden in three model ships of <b>the</b> <b>Unicorn.</b> Reaching the coordinates, they discover the island and, upon diving, they find the wreck of <b>the</b> <b>Unicorn.</b> Although they recover various artefacts from it, they do not find the treasure. Back in Belgium, Tintin realises that Sir Francis' message referred, not {{to the location of}} <b>the</b> <b>Unicorn,</b> but to a globe mounted on a statue in Sir Francis' former country home. Understanding now that Francis would never have left the treasure but would have taken it with him to his home, Tintin locates the coordinates to the treasure on the globe, presses a secret button he finds there, and discovers Red Rackham's treasure hidden inside.|$|E

5|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{thought that}} The Black Island linked to Hergé's other Adventures in various ways; he {{connected}} the counterfeit {{money in the}} story to the counterfeit idol in The Broken Ear and the fake bunker in Tintin in the Land of the Soviets. He also connected Tintin's solving of the puzzle in the airman's jacket to his solving of the pirate puzzles in The Secret of <b>the</b> <b>Unicorn,</b> and that in transmitting from a place of death, Ben Mor, or mort (death), it linked to Tintin's transmitting from the crypt of Marlinspike Hall in The Secret of <b>the</b> <b>Unicorn.</b>|$|E

5|$|Hergé's next Adventure of Tintin {{would be}} The Secret of <b>the</b> <b>Unicorn,</b> serialised in Le Soir from June 1942. He had collaborated closely with Van Melkebeke on this project, who had {{introduced}} many elements {{from the work}} of Jules Verne into the detective story, in which Tintin and Haddock searched for parchments revealing the location of hidden pirate treasure. The Secret of <b>the</b> <b>Unicorn</b> marked the first half of a story arc that was completed in Red Rackham's Treasure, serialised in Le Soir from February 1943; in this story, Tintin and Haddock search for the pirate's treasure in the Caribbean, with the character of Professor Calculus being introduced to the series. Following Red Rackham's Treasure, Hergé drew illustrations for a serialised story titled Dupont et Dupond, détectives ("Thomson and Thompson, Detectives"), authored by the newspaper's crime editor, Paul Kinnet.|$|E

5|$|In 1957, the {{animation}} company Belvision Studios produced Hergé's Adventures of Tintin, {{a series of}} daily five-minute colour adaptations based upon Hergé's original comics.
