The effect of low level wind shear can be factored into {{the selection of}} sail <b>twist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sail design, but this {{can be difficult to}} predict since wind shear may vary widely in different weather conditions.

25|$|Brokeback Mountain is a 2005 American neo-Western romantic drama film {{directed}} by Ang Lee and produced by Diana Ossana and James Schamus. Adapted from the 1997 short {{story of the}} same name by Annie Proulx, the screenplay was written by Ossana and Larry McMurtry.

25|$|He {{makes the}} analogy of the plot <b>twist</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> War of the Worlds, by H.G. Wells, where Earth {{pathogens}} made the Martian invaders of Earth sick and then die. Perhaps, he suggests, the same could happen to us on Earth if we return samples containing micro-organisms from Mars. On the one hand, he points out, this possibility seems unlikely {{because of the lack}} of contact between the two planets and because pathogens adapt to their host. On the other hand, the lack of contact also means that we would have never evolved any defences against any pathogens.|$|E

25|$|A similar problem {{affected}} {{some models}} of the Supermarine Spitfire. At high speeds, the ailerons could apply more torque than the Spitfire's thin wings could handle, and the entire wing would <b>twist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite direction. This meant that the plane would roll in the direction opposite to that which the pilot intended, {{and led to a}} number of accidents. Earlier models weren't fast enough for this to be a problem, and so it wasn't noticed until later model Spitfires like the Mk.IX started to appear. This was mitigated by adding considerable torsional rigidity to the wings, and was wholly cured when the Mk.XIV was introduced.|$|E
25|$|Creeling {{involved}} {{replacing the}} rovings bobbins {{in a section}} of the mule without stopping the mule. On very coarse counts a bobbin lasted two days but on fine count it could last for 3 weeks. To creel, the creeler stood behind the mule, he placed new bobbins on the shelf above the creel. As the bobbin ran empty he would pick it off its skewer in the creel unreeling 30cm or so of roving, and drop it into a skip. With his left hand, he would place on the new bobbin onto the skewer from above and with his right hand <b>twist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new roving into the tail of the last.|$|E
25|$|Baconian theory {{developed}} a new <b>twist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> writings of Orville Ward Owen and Elizabeth Wells Gallup. Owen's book Sir Francis Bacon's Cipher Story (1893–95) claimed to have discovered a secret history of the Elizabethan era hidden in cipher-form in Bacon/Shakespeare's works. The most remarkable revelation was that Bacon {{was the son of}} Queen Elizabeth. According to Owen, Bacon revealed that Elizabeth was secretly married to Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, who fathered both Bacon himself and Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, the latter ruthlessly executed by his own mother in 1601. Bacon was the true heir to the throne of England, but had been excluded from his rightful place. This tragic life-story was the secret hidden in the plays.|$|E
500|$|DNA can be twisted like a rope in {{a process}} called DNA supercoiling. With DNA in its [...] "relaxed" [...] state, a strand usually circles the axis of the double helix once every 10.4 base pairs, but if the DNA is twisted the strands become more tightly or more loosely wound. If <b>the</b> DNA is <b>twisted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{direction}} of the helix, this is positive supercoiling, and the bases are held more tightly together. If they are <b>twisted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite direction, this is negative supercoiling, and the bases come apart more easily. In nature, most DNA has slight negative supercoiling that is introduced by enzymes called topoisomerases. These enzymes are also needed to relieve the twisting stresses introduced into DNA strands during processes such as transcription and DNA replication.|$|R

25|$|The series 8 recommission {{press release}} stated {{there would be}} a <b>twist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final episode of series 7. In this episode, a nuclear bomb is set to explode, {{triggered}} by a Russian sleeper agent who is part of Operation Tiresias. As Parliament and the Royal Family are evacuated, the nuclear threat to London is eliminated when Ros and Lucas are able to turn Connie James and elude an FSB kill squad. While defusing the bomb, Connie is killed by its conventional explosives. Seconds before the bomb exploded, Connie revealed that it had not been Harry who sold Lucas North out to the Russians as Lucas had always believed but, rather, herself. The episode concludes with Harry, conscious but with his mouth taped shut, in the boot of a car being zipped up in a body bag by Viktor Sarkisian, head of the FSB's London station.|$|E

Yum-Yum is unwilling to marry under these circumstances, and so Nanki-Poo challenges Ko-Ko to behead him on the spot. It turns out, however, that Ko-Ko has never executed anyone, not even a Blue bottle, and cannot execute Nanki-Poo, because the ex-tailor is too soft-hearted. Ko-Ko instead sends Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum away to be wed (by Pooh-Bah, as Archbishop of Titipu), promising {{to present to the}} Mikado a false affidavit in evidence of the fictitious execution.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{inspired}} by a real dispute seen by the writers and starred Pemberton as Malcolm, Shearsmith as Archie, Jason Watkins as Kevin, Philip Glenister as Craig, and Ellie White as Anya. Callum Coates also appeared in the episode. Critics responded positively to [...] "The Bill", praising its humour, direction and acting. Glenister, Watkins and White were all singled out as providing particularly compelling performances. Despite considerable praise for the writing and timing, some commentators questioned the effectiveness of a <b>twist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> closing minutes, with a number criticising the final scene.|$|E

Billen was less impressed, saying that [...] "the ultimate <b>twist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tale was crude, and the insight that those who offer help need it most just a little banal - by this series' standards, at least". Owen, similarly, found the motives of [...] "Chloe" [...] unconvincing, and considered [...] "the surprisingly nihilistic final shot perhaps not fully earned or plausible", but confessed that the episode was able to [...] "outmanoeuvre" [...] him, as he did not foresee the ending.|$|E

Aerox called the game [...] "an extremely strong addition to the series", saying that the cohesiveness of the themes and narrative made the game's episodes more connected than those in previous Ace Attorney games, and that he liked how the game discusses subjects such as declining trust in the legal system, the definition of justice, and people considering winning more important than the truth. Vore said that the game's last two episodes had him [...] "glued to the screen", but that he was tired of the series' reuse of the same story structure, with early cases having small connections to a bigger case, which in turn has a connection to a mystery from the past.|$|E
500|$|Poe {{may also}} have been {{expanding}} on previous analytical works of his own including the essay on [...] "Maelzel's Chess Player" [...] and the comedic [...] "Three Sundays in a Week". As for the <b>twist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plot, Poe was likely inspired by the crowd reaction to an orangutan on display at the Masonic Hall in Philadelphia in July 1839. The name of the main character may have been inspired from the [...] "Dupin" [...] character in a series of stories first published in Burton's Gentleman's Magazine in 1828 called [...] "Unpublished passages in the Life of Vidocq, the French Minister of Police". Poe would likely have known the story, which features an analytical man who discovers a murderer, though the two plots share little resemblance. Murder victims in both stories, however, have their neck cut so badly that the head is almost entirely removed from the body. Dupin actually mentions Vidocq by name, dismissing him as [...] "a good guesser".|$|E
500|$|Director Alexander Singer {{admitted}} that the prop wasn't what they envisioned, and work was conducted on it post-production to improve it. Post-production was also problematic as there were several morphing scenes involving Odo and the female Founder, which required reactions by other actors.
