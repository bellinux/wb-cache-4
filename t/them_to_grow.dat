5|$|A bulk carrier, bulk freighter, or bulker is a {{merchant}} ship specially designed to transport unpackaged bulk cargo, such as grains, coal, ore, and cement in its cargo holds. Since the first specialized bulk carrier {{was built in}} 1852, economic forces have fuelled {{the development of these}} ships, causing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> in size and sophistication. Today's bulkers are specially designed to maximize capacity, safety, efficiency, and durability.|$|E
5|$|Endometrial cancer forms {{when there}} are errors in normal endometrial cell growth. Usually, when cells grow old or get damaged, they die, and new cells take their place. Cancer starts when new cells form unneeded, and old or damaged cells do not die as they should. The buildup of extra cells often forms a mass of tissue called a growth or tumor. These {{abnormal}} cancer cells have many genetic abnormalities that cause <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> excessively.|$|E
5|$|In the Philosophie Zoologique, Lamarck {{proposed}} that species could acquire new characteristics from influences in their environment, in two rules that he named as laws. His first law stated that use or disuse of a body's structures would cause <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> or shrink {{in the course}} of several generations. His second law held that any changes made in this way would be inherited. Together, Lamarck's laws imply the steady adaptation of animals to their environments.|$|E

After graduating from PCS that year, she applied to New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, but decided to focus on her film career when she was rejected.|$|E
5|$|While on Müller's trail, {{he happens}} to meet his old friend, the Portuguese {{merchant}} Oliveira da Figueira. With Figueira's help, Tintin enters Müller's house and knocks the criminal unconscious. He finds the prince, who is imprisoned in a dungeon, and rescues him as Haddock arrives with the authorities. Müller is revealed to be the agent of a foreign power responsible for the tampering of the fuel supplies, having invented a type of chemical in tablet form, which {{goes by the name}} Formula 14, that increases the explosive power of oil by a significant amount. Thomson and Thompson find the tablets and swallow them, thinking them to be aspirin, causing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> long hair and beards that change colour. After analysing the tablets, Professor Calculus develops an antidote for Thomson and Thompson and a means of countering the affected oil supplies.|$|E
5|$|A businessman, Blackmer, {{visits the}} reclusive Dr Orchard, a {{scientist}} {{who lives in a}} remote house on the Ambro River in South America. From the local plant Sidonicus americanus, Orchard has developed a food additive called Theramine; if administered to animals, the chemical causes <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> beyond their original size. Enlargement of animal stock would offer a simple solution to world famine and present other economic advantages. Blackmer's boatman, Culp, eavesdrops on the meeting. After a storm forces Blackmer to stay at the house for the night, Culp resolves to steal the Theramine and sell it to the highest bidder. Waiting until the other occupants fall asleep, he steals the keys to Orchard's laboratory from the housekeeper, Mrs Files. While filling a vial with a quantity of the chemical, Culp accidentally knocks the rest of the supply into a sink, and the Theramine drains into the Ambro River.|$|E

5|$|Balaenids rely {{on their}} huge heads, {{as opposed to the}} rorquals' throat pleats, to feed effectively. This feeding {{behavior}} allows <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> very big and bulky, without the necessity for a streamlined body. They have callosities, unlike other whales, {{with the exception of the}} bowhead whale. Rorquals have a higher proportion of muscle tissue and tend to be negatively buoyant, whereas right whales have a higher proportion of blubber and are positively buoyant. Gray whales are easily distinguished from other extant cetaceans by their sleet-gray color, dorsal ridges (knuckles on the back), and their gray-white scars left from parasites. As with the rorquals, their throat pleats increase the capacity of their throats, allowing them to filter larger volumes of water at once. Gray whales are bottom-feeders, meaning they sift through sand to get their food. They usually turn on their sides, scoop up sediment into their mouths and filter out benthic creatures like amphipods, which leave noticeable marks on their heads.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} higher boiling points, only metals and silicates could exist in solid {{form in the}} warm inner Solar System close to the Sun, and these would {{eventually}} form the rocky planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Because metallic elements only comprised a very {{small fraction of the}} solar nebula, the terrestrial planets could not grow very large. The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond the frost line, the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets, allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> massive enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements. Leftover debris that never became planets congregated in regions such as the asteroid belt, Kuiper belt, and Oort cloud. The Nice model is an explanation for the creation of these regions and how the outer planets could have formed in different positions and migrated to their current orbits through various gravitational interactions.|$|E

25|$|Ironically, Will and Jim {{can be said}} to have aged prematurely in the novel; {{the horrors}} of the {{carnival}} force <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> up fast to {{be able to deal with}} its tricks on a knowledgeable level. Furthermore, Will and Jim do take a brief ride on the carousel before Will pulls Jim off, and they are never shown reversing this process before Charles destroys its machinations. Thus, it can be stated that they, in fact, grow up slightly. In this case, though, Will and Jim have also matured emotionally, too, having had their first encounter with evil. This enables <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> more proportionally in both physical and emotional status.|$|E

25|$|Worldwide {{introduction}} of various mosquito species over large distances into regions {{where they are}} not indigenous has occurred through human agencies, primarily on sea routes, in which the eggs, larvae, and pupae inhabiting water-filled used tires and cut flowers are transported. However, apart from sea transport, mosquitoes have been effectively carried by personal vehicles, delivery trucks, trains, and aircraft. Man-made areas such as storm water retention basins, or storm drains also provide sprawling sanctuaries. Sufficient quarantine measures have proven difficult to implement. In addition, outdoor pool areas make a perfect place for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the British colonies, {{immigration}} {{began in}} 1607 and continued until {{the outbreak of}} the Revolution in 1775. Settlers cleared land, built houses and outbuildings, and on their own farms. The rich owned large plantations that dominated export agriculture and used slaves. Many were involved in the labor-intensive cultivation of tobacco, the first cash crop of Virginia. Tobacco exhausted the soil quickly, requiring that farmers regularly clear new fields. They used old fields as pasture, and for crops such as corn and wheat, or allowed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> into woodlots.|$|E

The new company became the largest independent grocery organization in the Carolinas.|$|E
25|$|Common bonsai species (particularly {{those from}} the Japanese tradition) are {{temperate}} climate trees from hardiness zones 7 to 9, and require moderate temperatures, moderate humidity, and full sun in summer with a dormancy period in winter that may need be near freezing. They do not thrive indoors, where the light is generally too dim, and humidity often too low, for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> properly. Only during their dormant period can they safely be brought indoors, and even then the plants require cold temperatures, reduced watering, and lighting that approximates {{the number of hours}} the sun is visible. Raising the temperature or providing more hours of light than available from natural daylight can cause the bonsai to break dormancy, which often weakens or kills it.|$|E
