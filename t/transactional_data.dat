40|$|Abstract: <b>Transactional</b> network <b>data</b> can {{be thought}} of as a list of one-to-many {{communications}} (e. g., email) between nodes in a social network. Most social network models convert this type of data into binary relations between pairs of nodes. We develop a latent mixed membership model ca-pable of modeling richer forms of <b>transactional</b> network <b>data,</b> including relations between more than two nodes. The model can cluster nodes and predict transactions. The block-model nature of the model implies that groups can be characterized in very general ways. This flexible notion of group structure enables discovery of rich structure in transactional net-works. Estimation and inference are accomplished via a variational EM algorithm. Simulations indicate that the learning algorithm can recover the correct generative model. Interesting structure is discovered in the Enron email dataset and another dataset extracted from the Reddit website. Anal-ysis of the Reddit data is facilitated by a novel performance measure for comparing two soft clusterings. The new model is superior at discovering mixed membership in groups and in predicting transactions...|$|R

The use of REST is growing with {{the inclusion of}} smart devices and the Internet of Things, {{within the scope of}} web information systems, along with large-scale distributed NoSQL data stores and other web-based and cloud-hosted services. There is an important subclass of web information systems and distributed applications which would benefit from stronger transactional support, as typically found in traditional enterprise systems. In this paper, we propose REST with Transactions, a <b>transactional</b> RESTful <b>data</b> access protocol and API that extends HTTP to provide multi-item <b>transactional</b> access to <b>data</b> and state information across heterogeneous systems.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that applications accessing Oracle distributed databases can run into potential performance issues which often lead to customers spending long hours on their business operations, spending money on new design and additional hardware. The reason behind these problems is that the applications designed for extracting data from distributed databases require special performance considerations when compared against the local standalone databases. This paper covers the distributed databases key Concepts, Architecture, identification of key performance root causes and optimization techniques for distributed queries of Oracle’s homogenous distributed databases. These techniques are for improving the application response time and throughput numbers. The paper also focuses on indicative performance comparison numbers for techniques which we had experienced in our various performance optimization exercises. WHY DISTRIBUTED DATABASES? Today's competitive business scenarios need their IT enterprises to operate across the globe. The enterprise databases play a very key role here as information is the backbone for organizations. The information is dispersed across the various databases {{in the form of}} <b>transactional</b> and <b>data</b> warehousing databases. Generally the business need is to have single consolidated data view from the <b>transactional</b> and <b>data</b> warehousing databases for proactive and faster decision making at the enterprise level and to get an edge over competitors. In Oracle environments these types of dispersed databases are connected through distributed database architecture and database links. The paper starts with a generic discussion on the distributed databases and then narrows down to Oracle homogenous distributed databases, the concepts and architecture. The paper focuses on the performance optimization techniques for the Oracle homogeneous distributed databases which authors have experienced during their various performance engagements...|$|R
