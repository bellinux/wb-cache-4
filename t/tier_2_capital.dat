50|$|<b>Tier</b> <b>2</b> <b>capital,</b> or {{supplementary}} capital, {{includes a}} number of important and legitimate constituents of a bank's capital base. These forms of banking capital were largely standardized in the Basel I accord, issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and left untouched by the Basel II accord. National regulators of most countries around the world have implemented these standards in local legislation. In the calculation of regulatory capital, Tier 2 is limited to 100% of Tier 1 capital.|$|E
50|$|Noncumulative {{perpetual}} debt {{is almost}} identical to typical preferred shares (most of which are noncumulative), the only difference being that preferred shares often {{have the option of}} conversion to common shares, while perpetual debt generally does not. Because noncumulative perpetual debt can be counted as <b>Tier</b> <b>2</b> <b>capital</b> (supplementary capital), it is generally issued by banks as a way to maintain capital requirements (i.e. capital adequacy ratio or CAR). The debt is generally callable by the issuer at some point.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{depository}} {{institutions are}} subject to risk-based capital guidelines issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). These guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy based primarily on the perceived credit risk associated with balance sheet assets, as well as certain off-balance sheet exposures such as unfunded loan commitments, letters of credit, and derivatives and foreign exchange contracts. The risk-based capital guidelines are supplemented by a leverage ratio requirement. To be adequately capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4%, a combined Tier 1 and <b>Tier</b> <b>2</b> <b>capital</b> ratio of at least 8%, and a leverage ratio of at least 4%, and {{not be subject to}} a directive, order, or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels. To be well-capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6%, a combined Tier 1 and <b>Tier</b> <b>2</b> <b>capital</b> ratio of at least 10%, and a leverage ratio of at least 5%, and not be subject to a directive, order, or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels. These capital ratios are reported quarterly on the Call Report or Thrift Financial Report. Although Tier 1 capital has traditionally been emphasized, in the Late-2000s recession regulators and investors began to focus on tangible common equity, which is different from Tier 1 capital in that it excludes preferred equity.|$|E

50|$|A {{revaluation}} reserve is a reserve created {{when a company}} has an asset revalued {{and an increase in}} value is brought to account. A simple example is the situation where a bank owns the land and building of its head-offices and bought the properties for $100 a century ago. A current revaluation is likely to reflect a large increase in value. The increase would be added to a {{revaluation reserve}}. The reserve may arise out of a formal revaluation carried through to the bank's balance sheet, or a notional addition due to holding securities in the balance sheet valued at historic cost. Basel II also requires that the difference between the historic cost and the actual value be discounted by 55% when using these reserves to calculate <b>Tier</b> <b>2</b> <b>capital.</b>|$|E

50|$|Subordinated debt is classed as Lower Tier 2 debt, {{usually has}} a {{maturity}} of {{a minimum of}} 10 years and ranks senior to Tier 1 debt, but subordinate to senior debt. To ensure {{that the amount of}} capital outstanding doesn't fall sharply once a Lower Tier 2 issue matures and, for example, not be replaced, the regulator demands that the amount that is qualifiable as <b>Tier</b> <b>2</b> <b>capital</b> amortises (i.e. reduces) on a straight line basis from maturity minus 5 years (e.g. a 1bn issue would only count as worth 800m in capital 4 years before maturity). The remainder qualifies as senior issuance. For this reason many Lower Tier 2 instruments were issued as 10 year non-call 5 year issues (i.e. final maturity after 10 years but callable after 5 years). If not called, issue has a large step - similar to Tier 1 - thereby making the call more likely.|$|E
