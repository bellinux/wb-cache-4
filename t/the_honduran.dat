5|$|Then-president Carlos Roberto Flores {{estimated}} that Mitch reversed 50years {{of progress in}} the country. Officials estimated it would take at least 15years to rebuild completely. The national gross domestic product (GDP) only grew {{at a rate of}} 3% due to the storm, compared with 5.1% in 1997, due to damaged infrastructure and lingering effects. In 1999, the economy of Honduras contracted by 1.9%, largely due to the storm. <b>The</b> <b>Honduran</b> government increased spending by 24.7%,. much of it emergency funds to restore communications and provide relief, which caused economic deficits. This caused inflation to increase from 13.6% to 15.7%. <b>The</b> <b>Honduran</b> government adjusted its economic plan, including privatization of various federal entities. For two years, the government temporarily halted taxes to businesses affected by the hurricane.|$|E

On 22 June, another rebel plane bombed <b>the</b> <b>Honduran</b> town of San Pedro de Copán; John Dulles claimed the attack had been by the Guatemalan air force, thus avoiding diplomatic consequences. The handful of bombers that the rebel forces had begun with were shot down by the Guatemalan army within a few days, causing Castillo Armas to demand more from the CIA. Eisenhower quickly agreed to provide these additional planes, bolstering the rebel force. William Pawley had a crucial role to play in the delivery of these aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In 1598 Alfonso Criado de Castilla became {{governor}} of the Captaincy General of Guatemala.

As {{a result of the}} survey, and after royal permission was granted, Criado de Castilla ordered {{the construction of a new}} port, named Santo Tomás de Castilla, at a favourable spot on the Amatique Bay not far from the lake. Work then began on building a highway from the port to the new capital of the colony, modern Antigua Guatemala, following the Motagua Valley into the highlands. Indigenous guides scouting the route from the highlands would not proceed further downriver than three leagues below Quiriguá, because the area was inhabited by the hostile Toquegua.|$|E

5|$|Late on September 17 when Greta's eye {{was just}} {{offshore}} Honduras, the country's government issued a hurricane warning {{for the eastern}} coastline. Around the same time, the Mexican government issued a hurricane warning for the eastern Yucatán peninsula, and on September 18 a hurricane warning was issued for the Belize and Guatemala coastlines. These advanced warnings helped reduce fatalities. In Puerto Castilla, Honduras, about 2,000 people were evacuated {{in advance of the}} storm. <b>The</b> <b>Honduran</b> government put its military, police, and Red Cross on standby in advance of the storm, due to fears of a repeat of Hurricane Fifi in 1974. However, unlike Fifi, which caused deadly floods in the region four years prior and took a similar track, Greta did not cause as significant river flooding in Honduras.|$|E

Several European Countries sent aid to Honduras, in addition to donations from the European Union. France sent medical equipment, and the government of Japan provided a field hospital that helped 300patients per day in the center of Tegucigalpa. Following the storm, the United Nations Development Programme sent a team to Honduras and El Salvador to determine the needs of the population. <b>The</b> <b>Honduran</b> government requested the team to assess the socio-economic impact of the storm. The World Food Programme provided $17million worth of food to the country.

5|$|Gregorio Bundio and his {{assistant}} José Santacolomba coached the team in the qualifying stages for the 1970 FIFA World Cup. This {{was the first time}} El Salvador participated in World Cup qualifying. As host, Mexico automatically qualified so there was just one qualification spot up for grabs. El Salvador won group 3, playing four games, winning three and losing one. Their record was 10 goals for and 5 goals against with 6 points. As a result, they qualified for a 3-game playoff against group 2 winner and traditional rival, Honduras. The first game, hosted on 8 June 1969 in <b>the</b> <b>Honduran</b> capital of Tegucigalpa, was won 1–0 by the home team and was followed by crowd violence. The second game, hosted on 15 June 1969 in the Salvadoran capital of San Salvador, was won 3–0 by El Salvador, and was followed by even greater violence. A play-off match took place in Mexico City on 26 June 1969. El Salvador won 3–2 after extra time. As a result of existing tensions being exacerbated by these matches, on 14 July 1969 the two countries began the 100-hour-long war known as the Football War. As a result of the conflict, El Salvador and Honduras were both disqualified from entering the 1969 CONCACAF Championship qualification.|$|E
5|$|Mitch caused such {{massive and}} {{widespread}} damage that Honduran President Carlos Roberto Flores claimed it destroyed {{fifty years of}} progress in the country. Honduras, the country most affected by the hurricane, received significant aid for the millions impacted by the hurricane. Mexico quickly gave help, sending 700tons of food, 11tons of medicine, four rescue planes, rescue personnel, and trained search dogs. Cuba also volunteered, sending a contingent of physicians to the country. The U.S. administration offered at first troops stationed in Honduras, and then withdrew them {{a few days after}} the storm. They also at first offered only $2million (1998USD) in aid, which came as a shock to residents, and president Carlos Roberto Flores alike. The U.S. later increased their offer to $70million (1998USD). <b>The</b> <b>Honduran</b> government distributed food, water, and medical services to the hurricane victims, including the more than 4million without water. In addition, the country initially experienced a sharp increase in the unemployment rate, largely due to the destruction of crop lands. However, rebuilding provided jobs in the following years. In Costa Rica, reconstruction after the hurricane increased the number of jobs by 5.9%, lowering the unemployment rate slightly.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Francelia {{struck the}} Bay Islands, <b>the</b> <b>Honduran</b> health {{ministry}} flew {{a doctor and}} nurse with medical supplies to the islands. Undamaged boats were used to transport people and supplies to the islands, utilizing relief goods intended for the recovery after a war earlier in 1969. In Guatemala, the president organized the National Emergency Committee to coordinate disaster relief, but after few organizations complied, there was duplicate relief work in some areas and no assistance in other areas. The Guatemalan Red Cross and the country's air force and army helped in the relief efforts. Citizens throughout the country donated over $200,000 worth of food and clothing. The government made widespread road and bridge repairs following the floods {{with the assistance of}} the United States, installing two Bailey bridges that were completed by early November; there were delays installing the bridges due to persistent unsettled weather. The United States ultimately provided $281,659 in aid to the country, mostly through the road reconstruction and C-rations. Other countries and Red Cross chapters sent money to Guatemala, including 10tons of medicine from Brazil, 500blankets from Chile, and 200bottles of snake bite serum from Costa Rica. El Salvador also received assistance from the United States, including food and blankets.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after being}} {{designated}} as Tropical Storm Ida on November4, {{the government of}} Nicaragua issued a tropical storm warning for the entire coastline of Nicaragua, {{and the government of}} Columbia also issued a warning for the nearby islands of San Andrés and Providencia. Later that day, a hurricane watch was declared for areas between Bluefields and the Nicaragua–Honduras border. As Ida moved closer to land, the tropical storm warning for San Andrés and Providencia was discontinued. Several hours later, the tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were modified to cover areas south of the Nicaragua–Honduras border to Puerto Cabezas and a hurricane warning was issued for areas south of Puerto Cabezas to Bluefields. After Ida made landfall in Nicaragua, all hurricane advisories were discontinued and replaced by a tropical storm warning. Shortly thereafter, a tropical storm watch was declared for areas along <b>the</b> <b>Honduran</b> coastline between Limón and the Nicaragua–Honduras border. However, all watches and warnings were discontinued once Ida weakened to a tropical depression on November6.|$|E
5|$|The Ch'olan {{languages}} were formerly widespread {{throughout the}} Maya area, {{but today the}} language with most speakers is Ch'ol, spoken by 130,000 in Chiapas. Its closest relative, the Chontal Maya language, is spoken by 55,000 {{in the state of}} Tabasco. Another related language, now endangered, is Ch'orti', which is spoken by 30,000 in Guatemala. It was previously also spoken in extreme west of Honduras and El Salvador, but the Salvadorian variant is now extinct and <b>the</b> <b>Honduran</b> one is considered moribund. Ch'olti', a sister language of Ch'orti', is also extinct. Ch'olan languages are believed to be the most conservative in vocabulary and phonology, and are closely related to the language of the Classic-era inscriptions found in the Central Lowlands. They may have served as prestige languages, coexisting with other dialects in some areas. This assumption provides a plausible explanation for the geographical distance between the Ch'orti' zone and the areas where Ch'ol and Chontal are spoken.|$|E
5|$|At around 18:00 UTC on October 22, the {{hurricane}} made landfall near Santiago de Cuba at its initial peak intensity, with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h).

Steered by persistent high-pressure ridging over the eastern United States and western Atlantic, the cyclone would maintain this highly unusual path {{for the remainder of}} its duration in open waters. It brushed Cuba's Cape Cruz and deteriorated to a tropical storm before passing relatively close to the western tip of Jamaica. On the morning of October 24, the barometer aboard a ship in the storm's eye fell to , its lowest recorded pressure. The ship measured winds outside of the lull only up to , but the storm was reintensifying, and once again achieved hurricane strength later in the day. It matched its previous peak intensity at 12:00 UTC on October 25 as it approached Cabo Gracias a Dios on the border of Honduras and Nicaragua. Shortly thereafter, {{the hurricane}} crossed <b>the</b> <b>Honduran</b> coast for its final landfall. The mountainous terrain of Central America worked to diminish the storm, which curved westward and steadily lost force, though observation of its decay was minimal.
