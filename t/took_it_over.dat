5|$|Born Kathy Petro, {{she grew}} up in a horse racing family from Massachusetts and married a fellow horseman, Tim Ritvo, in 1990. Kathy and Tim ran a race horse {{training}} operation in Florida, and In 2010 she <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> solo when Tim became part of the management of Gulfstream Park race track. Her accomplishments came against the backdrop of having been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in 2001 and receiving a heart transplant in 2008. In spite of the medication regime and immunity issues that transplant recipients face, she lives a normal life as a horse trainer and shows no signs of organ rejection.|$|E
5|$|Brownlee's {{impact is}} also felt through the {{organizations}} {{he participated in}} founding: the Alberta Wheat Pool remained an important player in Canadian agriculture until 1998, when it merged with Manitoba Pool Elevators to form Agricore Cooperative Ltd.. In 2001, this new company merged with the UGG to form Agricore United. In 2007, the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>over,</b> forming Viterra. Brownlee's vision, unique {{among the members of}} the Macmillan Commission, of a publicly controlled central bank became a reality in 1938, when the Bank of Canada shifted from private to government control.|$|E

5|$|To finance {{electrification}} at {{the beginning}} of the 20th century, American financier Charles Yerkes <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> and made it part of his Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) group. Electric propulsion was introduced in 1905, and by the end of the year electric multiple units operated all of the services. On 1 July 1933, the District Railway and the other UERL railways were merged with the Metropolitan Railway and the capital's tramway and bus operators to form the London Passenger Transport Board.|$|E
5|$|A {{project to}} convert the former southbound-only Richards Boulevard access {{just south of the}} American River to a {{standard}} signalized intersection was completed in August 2007; this improves access to existing and future development in the area, including redevelopment of a former rail yard, while slowing northbound traffic heading for the bridge and freeway. Another project converting Freeport Boulevard and 21st Street south of Broadway into two-way streets was also completed. 21st Street has carried northbound traffic since 1974, when Caltrans <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>over.</b> This will calm traffic while improving the intersection {{at the south end of}} the former one-way pair, which the RT Light Rail now crosses 21st Street just to the north of. In addition, the three blocks of F Street that carried southbound SR 160 from 12th Street to 15th Street have been calmed by the addition of a roundabout at 13th Street.|$|E

5|$|After {{the airport}} opened, {{services}} started with Widerøe-operated twenty-seat de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters. The airline operated two trips Bodø–Røst–Værøy–Bodø on weekdays and one round trip during the weekend. In addition, {{there were two}} weekly trips that connected Værøy to Leknes Airport before returning to Bodø. The service was subsidized by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Widerøe replaced the Twin Otters with 37-seat de Havilland Canada DHC-8-100 Dash 8s in 1995. The route from Bodø to Røst was made subject to public service obligation from 1 April 1997, which was won by the incumbent, after beating Valdresfly and Helikopter Service in the auction. The following contract, valid from 1 April 2000, was awarded to Guard Air, but this company folded in 2001. Helikopter Service operated the route temporarily until Widerøe <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> again the same year.|$|E
5|$|Andy's {{toys are}} welcomed {{by the other}} toys at Sunnyside, and are given a tour by Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear ("Lotso"), Big Baby, and Ken. The toys choose to stay, except Woody, who {{attempts}} to return to Andy, but is instead found by Bonnie, one of the Sunnyside students. She brings Woody home and plays with him along with her other toys, which are well-treated. Meanwhile, at Sunnyside, a group of toddlers play rough with Andy's toys. Buzz seeks out Lotso to request to have the toys moved to the older children's room, but Lotso declines. At the same time, Mrs. Potato Head, through an eye she inadvertently left in Andy's room, sees Andy searching for the toys. However, before they can leave, Andy's toys are imprisoned by Lotso's gang, guarded by Buzz, whom Lotso switched to Demo Mode (which caused him to believe he is a real space ranger, therefore turning against the other toys). At Bonnie's house, Woody meets a toy clown named Chuckles, who explains to Woody that he, Lotso, and Big Baby once had a beloved owner named Daisy. When the toys were accidentally left behind by Daisy's family during a trip, {{they made their way}} back to her house, where Lotso found that he had been replaced. Lotso lied to Big Baby, saying Daisy had replaced all of them. When they found Sunnyside, Lotso <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>over,</b> with Chuckles only getting out because Bonnie took him home, after he was broken, and fixed him.|$|E
5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>over,</b> took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E
