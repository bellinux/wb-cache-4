5|$|After the Lancastrians {{had ceased}} loosing their arrows, Fauconberg ordered his archers <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> again to shoot. When they had {{exhausted}} their ammunition, the Yorkists plucked arrows {{off the ground}} in front of them—arrows loosed by their foes—and continued loosing. Coming under attack without any effective response of its own, the Lancastrian army moved from its position to engage the Yorkists in close combat. Seeing the advancing mass of men, the Yorkist archers shot a few more volleys before retreating behind their ranks of men-at-arms, leaving thousands of arrows in the ground to hinder the Lancastrian attack.|$|E
5|$|Shane arms {{the rest}} of the group and they {{converge}} on the barn just as Hershel, Rick, and the other return with the snared walkers. Shane screams that walkers are not people and shoots one of the captive walkers before breaking the locks off the barn doors. Walkers start to file out, and Shane, Andrea, T-Dog (IronE Singleton), Daryl, and Glenn execute the zombies while the others watch. At the last moment, Sophia (Madison Lintz) emerges from the barn, dead and zombified. The group is paralyzed with shock and sadness, unable to act as Sophia walks towards them. Only Rick is able <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> and shoot her.|$|E
5|$|The Lennons {{were married}} on 23 August 1962 at the Mount Pleasant Register office in Liverpool. Fellow Beatles McCartney and George Harrison were in attendance, as was their manager, Brian Epstein, who was best man; no parents were there. The wedding was farcical, because {{as soon as}} the {{ceremony}} began a workman in the backyard of the building opposite started using a jackhammer which drowned out anything the registrar, Lennon, or Powell said. When the registrar asked for the groom <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward,</b> Harrison stepped forward instead. With no photographs or flowers the wedding party celebrated afterwards, at Epstein's invitation, in Reece's restaurant in Clayton Square, which was the same restaurant where Lennon's parents, Alfred Lennon and Julia Lennon, had celebrated their marriage in 1938. Lennon was 21 years old, and Powell 22. The newlyweds had no honeymoon, as Lennon had to play an engagement at the Riverpark Ballroom in Chester the same night, although they did travel to the Hotel George V in Paris, for a belated honeymoon on 16 September, but were accompanied by Epstein, even though he had not been invited to join them.|$|E

25|$|First, {{the townspeople}} would be {{gathered}} in a public place. Although attendance was voluntary, those who failed to show would automatically be suspect, so most would come. The inquisitors would {{provide an opportunity for}} anyone <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> and denounce themselves in exchange for easy punishment. As part of this bargain they would need to inform on other heretics.|$|E

25|$|Mother Theodore was not {{the first}} <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> when the Bishop of Vincennes asked the Sisters of Providence to {{establish}} an academy for young women in Indiana. Although she had been decorated by the French Board of Education for being a highly gifted and efficient teacher, Mother Theodore felt unworthy of the task of founding an institution of learning, but her superiors convinced Mother Theodore to accept the assignment. Mother Theodore and five other nuns arrived on October 22, 1840, more than three months after leaving France.|$|E
25|$|Hedwig {{grows more}} erratic and {{unstable}} {{as the evening}} progresses, until she finally breaks down, stripping off her wig, dress, and make-up, forcing Yitzhak <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> and sing ("Hedwig's Lament"/"Exquisite Corpse"). At the height of her breakdown, she seems to transform into Tommy Gnosis, who both begs for and offers forgiveness in a reprise of the song she wrote for him ("Wicked Little Town (Reprise)"). Hedwig, out of costume, finds acceptance within herself, giving her wig to Yitzhak. At peace, Hedwig departs the stage as Yitzhak takes over her final song, dressed fabulously in drag ("Midnight Radio").|$|E
25|$|On April 28, 1967, Ali {{appeared}} in Houston for his scheduled induction into the U.S. Armed Forces, {{but he refused}} three times <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> when his name was called. An officer warned {{him that he was}} committing a felony punishable by five years in prison and a fine of $10,000. Once more, Ali refused to budge when his name was called, and he was arrested. Later that same day, the New York State Athletic Commission suspended his boxing license and stripped him of his title. Other boxing commissions followed suit. Ali {{would not be able to}} obtain a license to box in any state for over three years.|$|E

5000|$|Joseph Skipsey {{faced an}} early tragedy when his father, Cuthbert, {{was shot dead}} on 8 July 1832 {{in the wake of}} a long and bitter miners' strike. On the Sunday evening, an [...] "affray" [...] {{occurred}} between a group of miners and special constables. Cuthbert Skipsey, an overman and someone who the pitmen would look up <b>to,</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> in an attempt to defuse the situation. One of the specials, George Weddell, pushed him away and shot him with his pistol. Weddell was arrested, tried, found guilty of manslaughter, and sentenced to six months hard labour.|$|R
25|$|The {{situation}} in Hungary took {{a sharp turn}} for the worse immediately after the celebrated victory over the Turks. The victorious commanders, including János Hunyadi, died of plague, Ulrich of Celje was murdered, and even the young King Ladislaus died suddenly the following year. The aged Đurađ Branković also died, his despotate passing to his son Lazar. Realizing that Hungary was drastically weakened and that he had crossed {{the point of no return}} by refusing the Sultan's demands, Thomas decided <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> to head the Christian coalition. In August 1456, Ragusa received an information from the King in the utmost secrecy: he was intent on declaring war on the Turks. He was far from capable of succeeding, and even suffered a Turkish raid in the beginning of 1457.|$|E
25|$|Since 1996, {{international}} cyclists have dominated. Cyclists {{from the}} U.S. have won 8 Classics, Mexico and Guatemala three each, and Belize five. Two of those belong to Ernest Meighan (1997, 2001), one to Shane Vasquez (2006) {{and one to}} Giovanni Choto (2012), while Darnell Barrow became the first Belizean {{to get back to}} back wins for Belize since 1995. A pattern has developed of younger Belizean cyclists and expendable foreign ones leading the race early, dropping back into the peloton, then allowing fresher, stronger, more well-known cyclists <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward.</b> Most Belizean teams bring in foreign riders to participate, then have to defend themselves to the outraged public when a foreigner wins. But that foreign participation also introduces Belizeans to fresh talent and provides for a real test of Belizean cyclists' capabilities.|$|E
25|$|During {{basketball}} practice, Troy {{has trouble}} focusing because his thoughts are on Gabriella {{and the idea}} that he might enjoy singing more than basketball ("Get'cha Head in the Game"). Gabriella and Troy go to the musical auditions where Sharpay and her twin brother Ryan Evans (Lucas Grabeel) perform ("What I've Been Looking For"), but Troy and Gabriella are both too shy to audition. When Gabriella finally gains the confidence <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward,</b> Troy offers to sing with her, but drama teacher Ms. Darbus (Alyson Reed) tells them that they are too late. After Ms. Darbus attempts to leave, Kelsi Nielsen (Olesya Rulin), the musical's composer, trips and drops her music sheets. Troy and Gabriella rush to help her, and they sing together as Kelsi plays piano ("What I've Been Looking For (Reprise)"). Ms. Darbus overhears them and gives them a callback audition.|$|E

500|$|In 1996, as Seattle Seahawks owner Paul Allen {{worked with}} the city {{to build a new}} {{football}} stadium for his team, the potential of an MLS expansion team that could be a co-tenant helped drive public support for the effort. Many of the state's voters supported the referendum to construct Seahawks Stadium because it was also expected to be a professional soccer venue. While the stadium problem was being resolved, a new issue emerged. [...] By 2000, MLS was moving away from league-operated teams to investor-operated teams, so wealthy individuals would need <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> for Seattle to obtain an MLS expansion team.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{universal}} {{praise of}} Bobby by critics, Beaver commented on his blog that {{a minority of}} fans dislike the character. Don Williams of BuddyTV, however, defended him—he believes Bobby to be the show's [...] "most important recurring guest star"—and noted that [...] "people will complain about anything". In his response to the criticism—an article entitled [...] "Why We Love Bobby Singer"—Williams wrote, [...] "I think it's a shame when people like Jim Beaver or Eric Kripke have <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> to address this vocal minority, especially when the minority is {{just a handful of}} people gathering at a certain TV website that's known for being snarky and negative about everything. The complaints of these supposed fans aren't even worth addressing, in my opinion." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{people did}} confess to even a minor {{role in the}} rioting, such as {{throwing}} a few stones, they were charged with affray. One resident told the 1986 Gifford Inquiry into the rioting: [...] "You would go to bed and you would just lie there and you would think, {{are they going to}} come and kick my door, what's going to happen to my children?... It was that horrible fear that you lived with day by day, knowing they could come and kick down your door and hold you for hours." [...] The inquiry heard that 9,165 police officers were either deployed on the estate or held in reserve between 10 and 14 October 1985. Thus, argues Rose, the police created, or at least intensified, a climate of fear in which witnesses were afraid <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward.</b>|$|E

500|$|After Lwaxana and Timicin {{spend an}} evening together, {{he tries to}} explain the custom of the Resolution. [...] He tells her that a fixed age had to be {{selected}} by the Kaelons because just randomly choosing a time to die would be heartless. Lwaxana finds the practice barbaric and refuses to accept the Kaelon tradition. [...] She tells Timicin how a Betazed woman on her planet successfully fought the tradition of wearing ornate wigs that contained live, captive birds. [...] It only took one courageous woman <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> and end this cruel tradition. [...] Lwaxana also compares Timicin's plans to end his life with his research to save his star. If it is Timicin's time to die, Lwaxana argues, perhaps it is also time for his star to die as well, so why should he {{continue to try to}} prevent it? Timicin thinks about what Lwaxana has told him.|$|E
500|$|As Somerset {{was content}} to stand and let his foes come to him, the opening move of the battle {{was made by the}} Yorkists. [...] Noticing the {{direction}} and strength of the wind, Fauconberg ordered all Yorkist archers <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> and unleash a volley of their arrows from what would be the standard maximum range of their longbows. With the wind behind them, the Yorkist missiles travelled farther than usual, plunging deep into the masses of soldiers on the hill slope. The response from the Lancastrian archers was ineffective as the heavy wind blew snow in their faces. They found it difficult to judge the range and pick out their targets and their arrows fell short of the Yorkist ranks; Fauconberg had ordered his men to retreat after loosing one volley, thus avoiding any casualties. Unable to observe their results, the Lancastrians loosed their arrows until most had been used, leaving a thick, prickly carpet in {{the ground in front of}} the Yorkists.|$|E
500|$|Gjems-Onstad became {{critical}} of the [...] "retracted regional leadership" [...] of the Home Front (hjemmefronten) which {{he became aware of}} in late 1944. According to him, he and his fellow resistance members had not even heard of their existence. He sent a wire to London requesting that they should take over what remained of Milorg, rather than remaining passive during the occupation only <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> as leaders of Milorg when the war was over. He became more critical when he became aware that they had started entering the administration in London and Stockholm, according to him without the necessary experience from practical fieldwork. He was shocked at the recklessness of one of them who arrived at one of their bases in Trondheim, concluding that they [...] "obviously had no idea about how strong the infiltration really was in Trondheim, nor how we worked." [...] The regional leadership that stepped forward after the war was according to Gjems-Onstad not identical with the actual leadership of Lark and Milorg during the war.|$|E
