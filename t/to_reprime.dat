A little puff of powder answered to the click of the lock, as the gun missed fire.

50|$|Some {{printers}} use {{a supplemental}} air-suction pump, utilizing the rubber capping station to suck ink through a severely clogged cartridge. The suction pump mechanism is frequently {{driven by the}} page feed stepper motor: it {{is connected to the}} end of the shaft. The pump only engages when the shaft turns backwards, hence the rollers reversing while head cleaning. Due to the built-in head design, the suction pump is also needed to prime the ink channels inside a new printer, and <b>to</b> <b>reprime</b> the channels between ink tank changes.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} investigation {{designed to}} evaluate and better define the overall characteristics of freezing blowby in a copper/water heat pipe was conducted. The results from various rates of restart heat addition and channel blockage, indicate that upon breakthrough the depressurization of the evaporator may result in an effective heat transport capacity far {{in excess of the}} steady-state transport limit. The resulting transient conditions imposed on the heat pipe by the effective increased heat transport capacity can cause a loss of liquid in the evaporator and potential dryout. Evidence is presented which indicates that in order to prevent either temporary or permanent dryout, sufficient liquid inventory must be present in the evaporator wicking structure to accommodate the increased transient thermal load and allow sufficient time for the capillary wicking structure <b>to</b> <b>reprime...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractNa channel {{subunits}} αSNS (PN 3) and αμ 1 (SkM 1) produce slowly inactivating/TTX-resistant {{and rapidly}} inactivating/TTX-sensitive currents, respectively. αSNS (PN 3) current recovers from inactivation (reprimes) rapidly. Sequence alignment identified the tetrapeptide SLEN, in the S 3 –S 4 linker of D 4, as αSNS-specific. To determine whether SLEN endows Na channels with slow kinetics and/or rapid repriming, we analyzed the transient Na current {{produced by a}} chimera μ 1 SLEN in HEK 293 cells. Neither kinetics nor voltage dependence of activation and inactivation was affected. However, repriming was {{twice as fast as}} in the wild type at − 100 mV. This suggests that SLEN may contribute <b>to</b> the rapid <b>repriming</b> of TTX-resistant Na current...|$|R
40|$|Photorelaxation of {{vascular}} {{smooth muscle}} (VSM) {{is caused by}} the release of nitric oxide (NO) from a finite molecular store that can be depleted by irradiating pre-contracted arteries with visible light. The ability of an ‘exhausted' vessel to respond to a further period of illumination is lost temporarily but then recovers slowly as the photosensitive store is reconstituted in the dark. The recovery process, termed repriming, displays an absolute requirement for endothelium-derived NO and is inhibited by pre-treating arteries with ethacrynic acid, a thiol-alkylating agent. Here we demonstrate that agents that up- or down-regulate glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis influence {{the extent to which the}} store is regenerated in the dark. Isolated rat tail arteries (RTAs) were perfused internally with Krebs solution containing phenylephrine (PE; mean [PE]±s. e. mean: 5. 78 ± 0. 46 [*]μM) and periodically exposed to laser light (λ= 514. 5 [*]nm, 6. 3 [*]mW[*]cm− 2 for 6 [*]min). Photorelaxations of control RTAs were compared with those from either (a) vessels taken from animals previously injected i. p. with buthionine sulphoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (three injections, 100 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 at 8 [*]h intervals); or (b) isolated RTAs that were perfused ex vivo with oxothiazolidine (OXO), a precursor of cysteine (10 − 4 [*]M OXO for 60 [*]min). RTAs from BSO-treated animals exhibited attenuated photorelaxations: the mean (±s. e. mean) amplitude of the response recorded after 72 [*]min recovery in the dark was 12. 4 ± 1. 6 % versus 21. 4 ± 2. 9 % for control arteries (n= 5; P< 0. 01). Conversely RTAs treated with OXO and allowed to recover for a similar period showed enhanced photorelaxations, 32. 6 ± 6. 3 % as compared to 21. 4 ± 2. 9 % for control arteries (n= 5; P< 0. 01). A hyperbolic curve fit <b>to</b> <b>repriming</b> curves for BSO-treated and control arteries returned asymptote values (maximum photorelaxations) of (mean±s. e. mean) 24. 2 ± 3. 2 % and 55. 2 ± 8. 5 %, respectively. The level of GSH in RTA extracts was measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Injecting animals with BSO decreased GSH to 85 % of control levels (P< 0. 05) while treatment of isolated vessels with OXO resulted in a 31 % increase above control levels (P< 0. 05). Thus, drug-induced changes in RTA GSH levels were positively correlated with altered photorelaxations. The results lead us to postulate that the photosensitive store in VSM is generated, at least in part, from intracellular GSH which becomes converted to S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) by nitrosating species that are formed ultimately from endothelium-derived NO. The possible physiological significance of a photolabile store of NO in VSM is discussed briefly...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{ability of}} a number of calcium {{antagonistic}} drugs including nitrendipine, D 600, and D 890 to block contractures in single skinned (sarcolemma removed) muscle fibers of the frog Rana pipiens has been characterized. Contractures were initiated by ionic substitution, which is thought to depolarize resealed transverse tubules in this preparation. Depolarization of the transverse tubules is the physiological trigger for the release of calcium ion from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and thus of contractile protein activation. Since the transverse tubular membrane potential cannot be measured in this preparation, tension development is used as a measure of activation. Once stimulated, fibers become inactivated and do not respond to a second stimulus unless allowed <b>to</b> recover or <b>reprime</b> (Fill and Best, 1988). Fibers exposed to calcium antagonists while fully inactivated do not recover from inactivation (became blocked or paralyzed). The extent of druginduced block was quantified by comparing the height of individual contractures. Reprimed fibers were significantly less sensitive to block by both nitrendipine (10 ~ and D 600 (10 and 22 ~ than were inactivated fibers. Addition of D 600 t...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{has been}} developed to examine {{the behavior of a}} titanium-water loop heat pipe (LHP) under standard and elevated acceleration fields. The LHP was mounted on a 2. 44 m diameter centrifuge table on edge with heat applied to the evaporator via a mica heater and heat rejected using a high-temperature polyalphaolefin oil (PAO) coolant loop. The LHP was tested under the following parametric ranges: heat load at the evaporator, 100 ≤ Qin ≤ 600 W; heat load at the compensation chamber, 0 ≤ Qcc ≤ 50 W; radial acceleration, 0 ≤ ar ≤ 10 g. For stationary operation, the evaporative heat transfer coefficient decreased monotonically with heat load while the thermal resistance decreased to a minimum then increased. Heat input to the compensation chamber was found to increase the evaporative heat transfer coefficient and decrease the thermal resistance for Qin = 500 W. Transient periodic flow reversal in the LHP was found for some cases, which was likely due to vapor bubble formation in the primary wick. Operation in an elevated acceleration environment revealed that dry-out was dependent on both Qin and ar, and the ability for the LHP <b>to</b> <b>reprime</b> after an acceleration event that induced dry-out was influenced by the evaporator temperature. The evaporative heat transfer coefficient and thermal resistance were found not to be significantly dependent on radial acceleration. However, the evaporator wall superheat was found to increase slightly with radial acceleration at high heat loads...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to determine the}} feasibility of using loop heat pipes to dissipate waste heat from power electronics to the skin of a fighter aircraft and examine the performance characteristics of a titanium-water loop heat pipe under stationary and elevated acceleration fields. In the past, it has been found that the boundary condition at the condenser can be a controlling factor in the overall performance of this type of thermal management scheme. Therefore, the heat transfer removed from the aircraft skin has been determined by modeling the wing as a flat plate at zero-incidence {{as a function of the}} following parameters: airspeed: 0. 8 ≤ Ma∞ ≤ 1. 4; altitude: 0 ≤ H ≤ 22 km; wall temperature: 105 ≤ Tw ≤ 135 °C. In addition, the effects of the variable properties of air have been taken into account. Heat transfer due to thermal radiation has been neglected in this analysis due to the low skin temperatures and high airspeeds up to Ma∞ = 1. 4. It was observed that flight speed and altitude have a significant effect on the heat transfer abilities from the skin to ambient, with heat rejection becoming more difficult with increasing Mach number or decreasing altitude. An experiment has been developed to examine operating characteristics of a titanium-water loop heat pipe (LHP) under stationary and elevated acceleration fields. The LHP was mounted on a 2. 44 m diameter centrifuge table on edge with heat applied to the evaporator via a mica heater and heat rejected using a high-temperature polyalphaolefin coolant loop. The LHP was tested under the following parametric ranges: heat load at the evaporator: 100 ≤ Qin ≤ 600 W; heat load at the compensation chamber: 0 ≤ Qcc ≤ 50 W; radial acceleration: 0 ≤ ar ≤ 10 g. For stationary operation (az = 1. 0 g, ar = 0 g), the LHP evaporative heat transfer coefficient decreased monotonically, thermal resistance decreased to a minimum then increased, and wall superheat increased monotonically. Heat input to the compensation chamber was found to increase the evaporative heat transfer coefficient and decrease thermal resistance for Qin = 500 W. Flow reversal in the LHP was found for some cases, which was likely due to vapor bubble formation in the primary wick. Operating the LHP in an elevated acceleration environment (az = 1. 0 g, ar 3 ̆e 0 g) revealed dry-out conditions from Qin = 100 to 400 W and varying accelerations and the ability for the LHP <b>to</b> <b>reprime</b> after an acceleration event that induced dry-out. Evaporative heat transfer coefficient and thermal resistance was found not to be significantly dependent on radial acceleration.

Since the transverse tubular membrane potential cannot be measured in this preparation, tension development is used as a measure of activation.

Fibers exposed to calcium antagonists while fully inactivated do not recover from inactivation (became blocked or paralyzed). The extent of drug-induced block was quantified by comparing the height of individual contractures. Reprimed fibers were significantly less sensitive to block by both nitrendipine (10 degrees C) and D 600 (10 and 22 degrees C) than were inactivated fibers. Addition of D 600 to fibers recovering from inactivation stopped further recovery, confirming preferential interaction of the drug with the inactivated state. A concerted model that assumed coupled transitions of independent drug-binding sites from the <b>reprimed</b> <b>to</b> the inactivated state adequately described the data obtained from reprimed fibers. Photoreversal of drug action left fibers inactivated even though the drug was initially added to fibers in the reprimed state. This result is consistent with the prediction from the model. The estimated KI for D 600 (at 10 degrees and 22 degrees C) and for D 890 (at 10 degrees C) was approximately 10 microM. The estimated KI for nitrendipine paralysis of inactivated fibers at 10 degrees C was 16 nM. The sensitivity of <b>reprimed</b> fibers <b>to</b> paralysis by D 600 and D 890 was similar. However, inactivated fibers were significantly less sensitive to the membrane-impermeant derivative (D 890) than to the permeant species (D 600), which suggests a change in the drug-binding site or its environment during the inactivation process. The enantomeric dihydropyridines (+) and (-) 202 - 791, reported to be calcium channel agonists and antagonists, respectively, both caused paralysis, which suggests that blockade of a transverse tubular membrane calcium flux is not the mechanism responsible for antagonist-induced paralysis. The data support a model of excitation-contraction coupling involving transverse tubular proteins that bind calcium antagonists...|$|R
40|$|Short {{muscle fibers}} (less than 1. 5 mm) from the m. lumbricalis IV digiti of Rana pipiens were voltage-clamped at - 100 mV with a two- {{microelectrode}} technique, in normal Ringer's solution containing 10 (- 6) g/ml tetrodotoxin. The activation curve relating peak tension to membrane potential could be shifted toward more negative or less negative potential values by hyperpolarizing or depolarizing the fiber membrane to - 130, - 120, or - 70 mV, respectively, {{which indicates that}} contractile threshold depends on the fiber membrane potential. Long (greater than 5 s) depolarizing (90 mV) pulses induce prolonged contractile responses showing a plateau and a rapid relaxation phase similar to K contractures. Conditioning hyperpolarizations prolong {{the time course of}} these responses, while conditioning depolarizations shorten it. The shortening of the response time course, which results in a decrease of the area under the response, is dependent on the amplitude and duration of the conditioning depolarization. Depending on the magnitude and duration, a conditioning depolarization may also reduce peak tension. When the area under the response is reduced by 50 %, the level of membrane potential also affects the repriming rate. During repriming, peak tension is restored before the contracture area. Thus, when peak tension is <b>reprimed</b> <b>to</b> 80 %, the area is reprimed by 50 % of its normal value. Repriming has a marked temperature dependency with a Q 10 higher than 4. These results are compatible with the idea that an inactivation process, voltage and time dependent, regulates the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum during these responses...|$|R
40|$|Discrete Ca 2 + release events (Ca 2 + “sparks”) were {{recorded}} in cut segments of single frog skeletal muscle fibers using a video-rate laser-scanning confocal microscope operating in line-scan mode (63 μs per line). Fibers loaded with the Ca 2 + indicator fluo- 3 were voltage clamped at a holding potential of 0 mV, briefly reprimed at − 90 mV, and then strongly depolarized with a large test pulse <b>to</b> activate any <b>reprimed</b> voltage sensors. Using this high time resolution system, {{it was possible to}} record individual Ca 2 + sparks at ∼ 30 -fold higher time resolution than previously attained. The resulting new experimental data provides a means of characterizing the time course of fluorescence during the brief (a few milliseconds) rising phase of a spark, which was not possible with the previously used 1. 5 – 2 ms per line confocal systems. Analysis of the time course of individual identified events indicates that fluorescence begins to rise rather abruptly {{at the start of the}} spark, continues to rise at a slightly decreasing rate to a relatively sharp peak, and then declines along a quasi-exponential time course. The mean rise time of 198 sparks was 4. 7 ± 0. 1 ms, and there was no correlation between rise time and peak amplitude. Average sparks constructed by temporally and spatially superimposing and summing groups of individual sparks having similar rise times gave a lower noise representation of the sparks, consistent with the time course of individual events. In theory, the rising phase of a spark provides a lower bound estimation of the time that Ca 2 + ions are being released by the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + channel(s) generating the spark. The observed time course of fluorescence suggests that the Ca 2 + release underlying a spark could continue at a fairly constant rate throughout the rising phase of the spark, and then stop rather abruptly at the time of the peak...|$|R
