40|$|Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) {{has been}} widely adopted for object identification. An RFID system {{comprises}} three essential components, namely RFID <b>tags,</b> <b>readers</b> and a backend server. Conventionally, the system {{is considered to be}} controlled by a single party who maintains all the secret information. However, in some practical scenarios, RFID <b>tags,</b> <b>readers</b> and servers could be operated by different parties. Although the private information should not be shared, the system should allow a valid tag to be authenticated by a legal reader. The challenge in designing the system is preserving the <b>tag</b> and <b>reader</b> 2 ̆ 7 s privacy. In this paper, we propose a novel concept of authorized RFID authentication. The proposed protocols allow the tag to be merely identifiable by an authorized reader and the server cannot reveal the tag during the reader-server interaction. We provide a formal definition of privacy and security models of authorized authentication protocols under the strong and weak notions and propose three provably secure protocol...|$|R

Because of this redirection, Microsoft is also able to track users and provide Tag analytics to publishers.|$|E

50|$|This simple {{protocol}} leaks considerable information, because anyone able {{to eavesdrop}} on the <b>tag</b> <b>reader</b> alone can determine {{all but the}} last bit of a tag's serial number. Thus a tag can be (largely) identified so long as the reader's signal is receivable, which is usually possible at much greater distance than simply reading a tag directly. Because of privacy and security concerns related to this, the Auto-ID Labs have developed two more advanced singulation protocols, called Class 0 UHF and Class 1 UHF, which are intended to be resistant to these sorts of attacks. These protocols, which are based on tree-walking but include other elements, have a performance of up to 1000 tags per second.|$|E

Leapfrog also sells bundles that can be purchased directly from their webpage that range between $70-$400. Before using the Tag stylus with a book, a software installation is required and an account set up with LeapFrog. Once the initial account is set up, then the Tag stylus must have the desired books' audio files downloaded to it. The stylus can hold multiple books at one time (from 4 to 10, {{depending on the size of}} the book and the amount of memory in the stylus). The <b>Tag</b> <b>reader</b> is powered by batteries.|$|E
