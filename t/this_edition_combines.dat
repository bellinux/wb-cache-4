40|$|This volume {{marks the}} {{conclusion}} of the fourth year since Archnet-IJAR was established. A considerable effort has been put into this volume, which addresses timely and pressing questions that pertain to design pedagogy in the built environment related fields. <b>This</b> special <b>edition</b> <b>combines</b> the second and third issues of volume 4 and integrates the efforts of more than 45 contributors from 12 countries presented in 32 papers. In response to our call on the web in August 2009 for papers, we have received more than 80 expressions of interest and more than 65 abstracts. The papers included in <b>this</b> <b>edition</b> are those of the accepted abstracts that were developed into full papers and followed the typical review process of the journal. These figures underscore a rising interest in writing about educating future architects and urban designers. In fact, they manifest a commitment to the field of design education in its broadest sense. Design education is the cornerstone of design professions. The approach to and the content of it are the backbone of design practices. This suggests {{that it has to be}} encountered and to be dealt with as a rich field of pedagogical discourse whose foundations, underlying theories, contents, and methods can be questioned and critically analyzed. Reaching across the boundaries of cultures and regions, the theme of this volume addresses design education in its fullest sense in order to reflect its worldwide status in 2010.

40|$|The Woman Who Married Clark Gable' (1985) is a pivotal, BAFTA {{nominated}} film in {{the career}} of Thaddeus O'Sullivan. Andrew Pattman's screenplay was adapted from Sean O'Faolain's short sorty and the film was O'Sullivan's first venture into directing drama for the screen. Starring Bob Hoskins and Brenda Friker, and set in late- 1930 s Dublin, it {{tells the story of}} an uninterrupted, domestic routine, and a stale marriage without children that is temporarily transformed by a cinematic obsession. Echoing the Hollywood screen of that era, O'Sullivan's film was shot on location in luminescent black-and-white. Lit, designed and costumed with beautiful detail, it captures the mood and pace of suburban Dublin life in the interwar period. Its central drama, coupling and English working-class lapsed Methodist with a devout Irish Catholic woman, teases out an emotional level the close, long-standing relations between Ireland and England that also spoke to its mid- 1980 s contexts. <b>This</b> special <b>edition</b> <b>combines</b> O'Faolain's original short story, the text of the screenplay, an introduction by the director, and is offered in dual-language translation, generously illustrated with images. It is framed for the reader by critical essays by Lance Pettitt, Roy Foster and Anelise Corseuil, notes and filmography. This book accompanies a digitally re-mastered, two-disk DVD of Thaddeus O'Sullivan's films, 1975, published by the Irish Film Institute, Dublin / St Mary's University College, London...|$|R
40|$|By the C 21 st {{the glue}} that bound moral {{communities}} was no longer necessarily a belief in a particular deity or the ritualistic practices that expressed this belief. While notions of the sacred and profane remain, these notions now deal with cultural ideology, economics {{and the politics of}} privilege. Moral communities, Tom Regan 32 argues, continue today, to be founded on the pillars of exclusion. Each community is bound by a 'moral' code that accrues privilege to members and disfavor to non-members. The Australian PhotoJournalist seeks to challenge the orthodoxy developed around journalism with particular reference to photojournalism. In doing this, the publication presents as an exemplar for documentary and journalistic research by combining the work, evidence, conclusions and knowledge developed in-field by leading practitioners of these disciplines. In the context of the work chosen for inclusion in the APJ, journalism and documentary practice is defined as a blending of rigorous investigations and ethnographic research within an aesthetic frame, that combined, disseminate the tacitly understood. Studies of the human condition are studies of the non-rational elements of human practice that have been largely ignored by traditional researchers because they are not conducive to interrogation by scientific methodologies. Pink (2006), a visual ethnographer, argues that the changing paradigms of research methodologies "paved the way for the visual to be increasingly acceptable in researching the human condition "妯r it is no more subjective or objective than written texts" In addition to providing new understanding of human practice each edition of the APJ challenges traditional notions of research and presents documentary practice as legitimate modes of inquiry. Documentary practice and by extension the Australian PhotoJournalist, combines the evidentiary and concrete with the metaphoric and expressive, each of which offers a valuable contribution to the creation and communication of meaning. When used with text, this text image combination stimulates the cognitive and affective spheres of our intelligence allowing us to understand through empathy. Within this context, Epilogue challenges the tired notions of main-stream journalism and documentary practice. It published the work of in-field researchers who undertake long term investigations of their subjects and, in many instances, become stakeholders in the lives of those whose stories are told. The compilation of stories attempt to contextualise human practice within the multidimensional and non-linear frames of human practice. <b>This</b> <b>edition</b> <b>combines</b> the expertise of visually articulate practitioners schooled in research methods and incorporates more holistic research methodologies while exploring the nature of the human condition in the 21 st Century.
