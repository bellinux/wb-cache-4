500|$|Sonic at the Olympic Games is a Sonic-themed sports {{game for}} mobile phones {{released}} in June 2008. Developed by AirPlay {{and published by}} Sega, the game features five events based on the Olympic Games starring Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Amy. Players control one character from a two-dimensional prospective through one-button commands. The commercial success of Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games started a series of Mario & Sonic sport video games to coincide with upcoming Summer and Winter Olympic Games. Sean Ratcliffe, {{vice president of marketing}} at Sega of America said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> factor that decides the ongoing building of this franchise is basically success. Is the game successful? Are consumers happy with it?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Robin Hood and the Sorcerer" [...] {{was shot}} at Bowood House. Helen Phillips said of his {{performance}} as Little John, [...] "excellently played by Clive Mantle, the series' John at first appears to conform to a, by then, well- established stereotype." [...] Mantle has said of his role: It is the job I've enjoyed doing {{more than anything else}} on TV. I have the greatest memories of beautiful, halcyon days-out filming on location and we had such a great, fun crew working on the show. We still get together once a year. Not just the cast but also the directors, producer, props guys, it's like a family! I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to part of the series' success was that this great camaraderie came across on screen.|$|E
500|$|Songs {{featured}} in the pilot are [...] "Where is Love?" [...] from Oliver!, Aretha Franklin's [...] "Respect", [...] "Mister Cellophane" [...] from Chicago, Katy Perry's [...] "I Kissed a Girl", [...] "On My Own" [...] from Les Misérables, [...] "Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat" [...] from Guys and Dolls, [...] "You're the One That I Want" [...] from Grease, REO Speedwagon's [...] "Can't Fight This Feeling", Amy Winehouse's [...] "Rehab" [...] and [...] "Don't Stop Believin' and [...] "Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin' by Journey. The director's cut version also includes an acoustic rendition of John Denver's [...] "Leaving on a Jet Plane". Murphy {{was surprised at the}} ease with which use of songs was approved by the record labels approached, and explained: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to it is they loved the tone of it. They loved that this show was about optimism and young kids, for the most part, reinterpreting their classics for a new audience." [...] The score of the episode features a cappella covers of instrumental songs provided by The Swingle Singers. Dance routines were choreographed by Zach Woodlee.|$|E

500|$|Murphy was {{responsible}} for selecting all of the songs covered on the album, and strove to maintain a balance between show tunes and chart hits. He {{was surprised at the}} ease with which use of songs was approved by the record labels approached, and explained, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to it is they loved the tone of it. They loved that this show was about optimism and young kids, for the most part, reinterpreting their classics for a new audience." [...] Music supervisor P.J. Bloom cleared the song rights with their respective publishers, and music producer Adam Anders rearranged the tracks for the Glee cast. [...] "Take a Bow" [...] was offered for use at a reduced licensing rate, which surprised Murphy, who had believed {{he would not be able}} to afford the rights given that it had been a number one hit for Rihanna. Neil Diamond had some reluctance over licensing [...] "Sweet Caroline" [...] to the show, and retracted clearance after it had already been recorded. Bloom was able to convince him to reverse his decision, and Diamond went on to also license his song [...] "Hello Again" [...] for use on the show at a later date.|$|E

They loved that this show was about optimism and young kids, for the most part, reinterpreting their classics for a new audience." [...] A minority of those approached refused to allow their music to be used, including Bryan Adams, Guns N' Roses and Coldplay; however, in June 2010, Coldplay reversed their decision, allowing Glee the rights to their catalog. Adams posted on his Twitter account that the producers of Glee had never requested permission from him and urged them to [...] "pick up the phone". Composer and musician Billy Joel offered many of his songs for use on the show, and other artists have offered use of their songs for free. A series of Glee soundtrack albums have been released through Columbia Records. Songs featured on the show are available for digital download through iTunes up to two weeks before new episodes air, and through other digital outlets and mobile carriers a week later. Glee music producers Adam Anders and Peer Astrom have begun to add original music to the show, including two original songs, [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] and [...] "Get It Right", on the March 15, 2011 episode.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers of {{the episode}} have also praised it for its {{character}} development. Todd Gilchrist of IGN said he <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to <b>The</b> Simpsons longevity is its [...] "sentimental but not gooey" [...] approach to storytelling and character development. He cited [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian" [...] as an example and said: [...] "Lisa sabotages Homer's barbecue, which results in an unceremonious death for his prize pig. But rather than simply punctuating the episode with an iconic image of the porker soaring through the air, the writers actually develop a story into which the joke fits. The comedic effect is actually intensified because we care about the characters, are invested in the story, and primed for a great gag." [...] The Niagara Gazettes Phil Dzikiy said that [...] "the character development and storytelling is perfect", noting that the episode was [...] "equally hilarious, touching and satirical".|$|R
40|$|Lots of {{business}} experts have great {{ideas about the}} ways in which Web technologies can be used to enhance customer/partner relationships, increase market share, enhance competitive advantage, etc. However, many of these e-business ideas never take shape simply because it was so difficult to "sell" the idea to <b>the</b> <b>key</b> business decision-makers. What is <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to selling an e-business idea to decision-makers? What are the strategic factors who make this idea to become real? I <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> <b>key</b> is to try to understand the decision from their perspective. ...|$|R
50|$|But I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> {{thing is}} getting the right string players. It {{has to be a}} very high octane, high gloss, soloist sort of player. The string sound isn’t blended down, it’s blended up. You play up to the best. It’s a very in-your-face, {{expensive}} sort of string sound and {{it takes a lot of}} playing. You have to have the best players, but we're spoilt in this country for terrific orchestral performers.|$|E

But I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> word here is that I probably wouldn't run. But I haven't made up my mind as yet." [...] The following month, Lightfoot decided not to run for reelection.|$|E
5000|$|In 2002, {{following}} {{his work on}} Suffering City Vol. 1, Suffa also revealed a perspective on hip hop production that he had discovered {{at that time of}} his career: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to hip hop production is keeping things rough. If a song’s too clean it loses its edge. My advice to producers is to look outside the standard jazz, funk and soul breaks for samples. I’ll sample anything, even if someone else has already used it. I’ve stopped caring about ‘The rules’." ...|$|E

Benny tells Ray and Len that Patterson <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> they and Rita had {{were used in the}} robbery. Benny sacks Len. Rita takes him to task for it. Rita tells Len he won't have time to run the yard and be a councillor. She makes him buy Ray and Jerry a drink. Rita tells a worried Elsie about the night club deal. Benny feels life is looking up with the new business venture. He gets Rita to support him in a meeting to discuss terms with Jimmy and Alan. Jimmy, Alan and Elsie join Rita and Benny. Jimmy and Benny agree to be equal partners in the new club venture with Alan looking after Jimmy's interests in his absence. Rita decides to take the job of hostess at the Club, keeping on the Betting Shop as well. Mayor Harold Chapman tells Len he's in for a chance of being the next Mayor of Weatherfield and tells him to look out for a suitable Mayoress, insinuating that Rita doesn't cut the mustard.|$|R

5000|$|After {{reading the}} statement, Corera {{emphasized}} that the sources he spoke with [...] "were careful not to deny that a meeting did take place with the Iraqi intelligence chief {{on the eve of}} war in which this man Habbush denied Saddam had any weapons. But I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> question is whether he was meeting MI6 as a spy providing secret intelligence on Saddam, in which case his information might have been taken very seriously, or whether, in fact, this was a back channel that Saddam Hussein himself had authorized, and that therefore this Iraqi intelligence chief Habbush was simply saying what other Iraqi intelligence officials were already saying." ...|$|E

5000|$|He is a {{dedicated}} Christian. Belfort believes {{the most important}} key to his success and longevity in the sport {{is that he is}} happy with what he does. [...] "I just thank God every day. I’m happy. I’m healthy. Bottom line is it's just the way you treat life and life will treat you back. Make sure you’re happy with whatever is going on in your life. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> of life is just be happy with what's {{in front of you and}} the decision of my life is under God and God knows what's best for me."

500|$|Naughty Dog {{consciously}} avoided action game stereotypes, including super-powered {{heroes and}} overly sexualized female characters. They included a large {{cast of characters}} {{to ensure that the}} story was character-driven rather than story-driven. Co-president of Naughty Dog Evan Wells stated, [...] "I honestly <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> <b>key</b> element, {{if you really want to}} boil it down, is characters. People will tell a story, but if it's not a character-driven plot then you are missing something." [...] Many of these characters were specifically designed to highlight different facets of Nathan Drake's personality.|$|R
5000|$|The {{lines were}} much quoted in antiquity, as for example by Stobaeus and Sextus Empiricus, {{and it was}} imitated by later poets, such as Sophocles and Bacchylides. Theognis himself might be imitating others: each of the longer hexameter lines is loosely paraphrased in the shorter pentameter lines, as if he {{borrowed}} the longer lines from some unknown source(s) and added the shorter lines to create an elegiac version. Moreover, the last line could be imitating an image from Homer's Odyssey (5.482), where Odysseus covers himself with leaves though some scholars <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> word [...] might be corrupted. The smothering accumulation of eta (...) sounds in {{the last line of}} the Greek is imitated here in the English by mound round.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{some reports}} that Bowie was unhappy {{working in the}} band, Bowie stated several times over his years with Tin Machine that he was happy working in the band. Bowie used his time with the band {{as a way to}} revitalize himself and his career (which he would later in March 1997 call a [...] "lifeline"), citing Reeves Gabrels as a source of his new-found energy and direction: Reeves took me aside and spent many hours {{explaining}} it in very simple terms. 'Stop doing it' was, I <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> phrase he used. 'Stop doing it.' 'But you know, I've got all these shows I've got to do, and I hate having to do these hits, and ...' 'Stop doing it.' That was essentially the reasoning, which I found extremely complicated to understand at first. And then it dawned on me—he meant stop...doing...it. And I did.|$|E
5000|$|Following the {{qualifying}} session, Edwards stated, [...] "There's {{really no}} pressure. It's {{just go out}} and have fun, try not to run into Clint Bowyer or any of those guys that have a lot on the line. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> for us is to {{just go out and}} win a race. While the pressure's off, you can go out and you can take risks and race harder and sometimes {{you get a chance to}} perform really well. That's just what we need to start the Chase." [...] After qualifying fourth, Bowyer predicted that teams would utilize several different strategies as the race went on: [...] "Some teams can afford to take gambles — fuel mileage-wise, tire-wise, strategy-wise. That separates the race out. It really shakes things up. At the end of the races you are going to see guys keeping track position and doing whatever it takes to be up front to have that opportunity to win." ...|$|E
5000|$|Idea, {{released}} in September 1968, was the Bee Gees' third international album. [...] "We were in friction at that point," [...] says Barry. [...] "We weren't getting on, {{and that was}} it. I {{think it was a}} mixture of the group not getting along very well and egos. Ego, I <b>think,</b> is <b>the</b> <b>key</b> word for this group. It's not unlike any other group in that everybody wants to be the one that gets the attention. Unfortunately, I think that happens a lot. Certainly it happened to us." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{first game}} in the series, Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games, is the first {{official}} crossover title to feature characters from both Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog's respective franchises. The Olympic Games were chosen as a setting since Sega and Nintendo felt its competitive sportsmanship was ideal for the once-rival mascots Sonic the Hedgehog and Mario. Sonic the Hedgehog is the protagonist of the video game series released by Sega {{in order to provide}} the company with a mascot to rival Nintendo's flagship character Mario in the early 1990s. Sean Ratcliffe, vice president of marketing at Sega of America commented on whether the Mario & Sonic series had a future past its second installment, Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games.

The EP was released in November 1998 and was limited to 1,000 copies. During the album recording sessions, the band were facing the prospect of finding a lead singer, but found themselves more than satisfied with bassist Jimi Goodwin's vocals: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> songs for us on Lost Souls were [...] "The Cedar Room" [...] and [...] "Break Me Gently", {{because they were the}} first songs Jimi sang properly and we realised we needn't go looking outside the band for this 'mythical singer', something our friend and label boss Rob Gretton had been telling us for years," [...] said Andy Williams.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT In this paper, 1 we {{survey the}} Chinese {{polyphonic}} characters and introduce our solution to convert them into Pinyin.

Then we introduce the methods we used to judge the Pinyin of PMC words and the polyphones in undefined words in our automatic Chinese text-to-Pinyin system.
