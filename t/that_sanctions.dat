25|$|Some in Israel {{are worried}} that Iran may achieve a latent {{capability}} to produce nuclear weapons without taking any overt steps that would expose it to further international action.

25|$|He told General Jones that Iranian {{internal}} turmoil {{presented an}} opportunity to weaken the regime—which he encouraged—but he also urged that this be done covertly, stressing that public statements {{in support of the}} reformers were counterproductive. The King assessed <b>that</b> <b>sanctions</b> could help weaken the government, but only if they are strong and sustained.|$|E
25|$|The {{consequences}} of the decision have been mixed. On the one hand, {{four members of the}} Committee, Rabbis Joel Roth, Leonard Levy, Mayer Rabinowitz, and Joseph Prouser, resigned from the CJLS following adoption of the change. On the other hand, the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies of the University of Judaism (now the American Jewish University) in Los Angeles had previously stated that it will immediately begin admitting gay/lesbian/bisexual students as soon as the law committee passes a policy <b>that</b> <b>sanctions</b> such ordination. On March 26, 2007, the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York followed suit and began accepting openly gay/lesbian/bisexual candidates for admission for their Rabbinical program.|$|E

25|$|Kentucky {{is one of}} the 32 {{states in}} the United States <b>that</b> <b>sanctions</b> the death penalty for certain murders defined as heinous. Those convicted of capital crimes after March 31, 1998 are always {{executed}} by lethal injection; those convicted on or before this date may opt for the electric chair. Only three people have been executed in Kentucky since the U.S. Supreme Court re-instituted the practice in 1976. The most notable execution in Kentucky was that of Rainey Bethea on August 14, 1936. Bethea was publicly hanged in Owensboro for the rape and murder of Lischia Edwards. Irregularities with the execution led to this becoming the last public execution in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) is an American family-owned and {{operated}} business venture <b>that</b> <b>sanctions</b> and governs multiple auto-racing sports events. Bill France Sr. founded {{the company in}} 1948 and his grandson Brian France became its CEO in 2003. NASCAR is motorsport's preeminent stock-car racing organization. The three largest racing-series sanctioned by this company are the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, the Xfinity Series, and the Camping World Truck Series. The company also oversees NASCAR Local Racing, the Whelen Modified Tour, the Whelen All-American Series, and the NASCAR iRacing.com Series. NASCAR sanctions over 1,500 races at over 100 tracks in 39 of the 50 US {{states as well as}} in Canada.

25|$|To ensure {{profits to}} {{complete}} the park, fair organizers knew {{they would have to}} maximize receipts. An estimated attendance of 70million people would be needed to turn a profit and, for attendance that large, the fair would need to be held for two years. The World's Fair Corporation also decided to charge site-rental fees to all exhibitors who wished to construct pavilions on the grounds. This decision caused the fair to come into conflict with the Bureau of International Expositions (BIE), as the international body headquartered in Paris <b>that</b> <b>sanctions</b> world's fairs: BIE rules stated that an international exposition could run for one six-month period only, and no rent could be charged to exhibitors. In addition, the rules allowed only one exposition in any given country within a 10-year period, and the Seattle World's Fair had already been sanctioned for 1962, as 2 years prior.|$|E

This paper summarises existing studies, alongside an international review based on 140 documents and 38 expert interviews, into four ‘stylized facts’: (i) requirements for disability benefit claimants are common, but sanctioning is rare; (ii) assessment and support are critical for implementing conditionality; (iii) limited but robust existing evidence suggests <b>that</b> <b>sanctioning</b> may have zero or even negative impacts on work-related outcomes for disabled people; and (iv) individual case studies suggest <b>that</b> <b>sanctioning</b> can lead to destitution and affect mental health...|$|R
25|$|Powell {{came under}} fire {{for his role in}} {{building}} the case for the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. In a press statement on February 24, 2001, he had said <b>that</b> <b>sanctions</b> against Iraq had prevented the development of any weapons of mass destruction by Saddam Hussein. As {{was the case in the}} days leading up to the Persian Gulf War, Powell was initially opposed to a forcible overthrow of Saddam, preferring to continue a policy of containment. However, Powell eventually agreed to go along with the Bush administration's determination to remove Saddam. He had often clashed with others in the administration, who were reportedly planning an Iraq invasion even before the September 11 attacks, an insight supported by testimony by former terrorism czar Richard Clarke in front of the 9/11 Commission. The main concession Powell wanted before he would offer his full support for the Iraq War was the involvement of the international community in the invasion, as opposed to a unilateral approach. He was also successful in persuading Bush to take the case of Iraq to the United Nations, and in moderating other initiatives. Powell was placed at the forefront of this diplomatic campaign.|$|E

500|$|The Rhodesian High Court granted full de jure {{recognition}} to the post-UDI government on 13 September 1968, while rejecting the appeals of 32 black nationalists {{who had been a}} month earlier convicted [...] of terrorist offences and sentenced to death. Beadle declared that while he believed the Rhodesian judiciary should respect rulings of the Privy Council [...] "so far as possible", the judgement of 23 July had made it legally impossible for Rhodesian judges to continue under the 1961 constitution. He asserted that the court therefore faced a choice between the 1965 constitution and a legal vacuum, the latter of which he felt he could not endorse. Referring to the Privy Council's decision that the UK might yet remove the post-UDI government, he said that [...] "on the facts as they exist today, the only prediction which this court can make is <b>that</b> <b>sanctions</b> will not succeed in overthrowing the present government... and that there are no other factors which might succeed in doing so".|$|E

30|$|In addition, {{as can be}} {{seen from}} Additional file  1 : Figure S 2, {{agencies}} <b>that</b> <b>sanction</b> frequently and agencies that {{do not appear to be}} distributed more or less randomly across the sampled regions. In many cases, agencies <b>that</b> <b>sanction</b> frequently and non-frequently directly border each other. In the city of Berlin, for example, five welfare agencies are sampled. Two of them use sanctions frequently, while three do not. Since Berlin can be regarded as a single labor market, which is identical for all five agencies within the city, and since the composition of UBII recipients in these five agencies is quite similar, it is unlikely <b>that</b> the <b>sanction</b> strategy of an agency depends on the labor market state or the sociodemographic characteristics of the UBII recipients. A similar picture arises with respect to the actually observed sanction rates within the agencies (see Additional file  1 : Figure S 3).|$|R

40|$|Recent {{literature}} {{argues that}} studies of economic sanction effectiveness {{suffer from a}} selection bias by considering only those <b>sanctions</b> <b>that</b> are deployed and not just threatened. These sanction threats, it is argued, should be more successful because both sender and target {{have an incentive to}} solve their dispute before entering into a costly economic sanction episode. Testing this assertion is somewhat problematic because sanction threats are, in essence, non-events— <b>sanctions</b> <b>that</b> were never deployed. This paper provides an empirical assessment of one set of threatened economic sanctions—the U. S. threats to revoke or condition China’s MFN status from 1989 to 1995. We show that Washington’s threats did not affect the level of Chinese political repression and actually decreased the human rights accommodations offered by Beijing. Further, when China was cooperative, the U. S. de-escalated its threats. We do not conclude <b>that</b> <b>sanction</b> threats are generally ineffective but <b>that</b> <b>sanction</b> threats directed at human rights behavior create expectations of future conflict that result in their failure. Theoretically, the results highlight the importance of considering the impact that the target’s behavior has on the sender’s sanction decisions. The results also suggest that engagement with countries openin...|$|R
