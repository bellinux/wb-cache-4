5|$|The Ballroom, {{the last}} of the palace's three largest rooms, (illustrated below) was {{designed}} by Robillon in 1760. To create this oval room the architect combined five smaller rooms. The ormolu Rococo ornament takes the form of heavy gilding to <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceiling,</b> of such richness that it has been compared with that of François de Cuvilliés' Amalienburg at Schloss Nymphenburg. The walls and doors are mirrored and the painted and gilded, coffered ceiling is supported by golden caryatids.|$|E
25|$|Gabinetto Vieusseux Library (Biblioteca del Gabinetto Vieusseux): All 250,000 volumes were damaged, {{including}} {{titles of}} romantic literature and Risorgimento history; submerged in water, they became swollen and distorted.

25|$|The {{interior}} walls are plaster applied over an interior brick face, with vertical beadboard and molded chair rail complemented by a similar cornice at the joint between <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceiling.</b> The slip pews {{are made of}} oak with tre- and quatrefoil carvings at the ends. The floors {{in the center and}} side aisles are laid in a polychrome glass pattern, with carpet covering the area under the pews. There is a brass dedication plaque on the west wall.|$|E
25|$|Wall {{paintings}} {{inside the}} prayer {{halls of the}} temple have been mostly white washed. Some of the paintings still discernible on the south-west column of the northern devotional hall have been restored by the Department of Archaeology of Myanmar. Some of the paintings seen in good condition are: on <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the eastern devotional hall; the pictures of re-appeared Buddha, north {{of the statue of}} standing Buddhas, Arahats and lotus flowers; and floral designs on the western entrance.|$|E
25|$|The decorations:On {{one side}} of the {{courtyard}} is the temple proper, on a raised dais four feet high. The building and decorations are exquisite; the shafts of all the arches are of polished white marble inlaid with flowing flowery patterns in coloured marbles. <b>The</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceiling</b> and every available inch are painted richly, the prevailing colours being blue and gold, but all so artistically blended that the eye only takes in the general effect, which is something like that of a Cashmere shawl.|$|E

25|$|The Cathedral, {{dedicated}} to Saint Mary, {{was built in}} Romanesque style during the years 10711105, with Gothic-style additions in the mid-13th century. The crypt contains the tombs of St Magnus of Anagni, the patron of the city, and of St Secundina of Anagni. The frescoes covering all <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceiling</b> {{are among the best}} preserved examples of Romanesque/Byzantine art in Italy, and form a single iconographic scheme, which includes natural philosophy, saints, the Apocalypse, and the Old Testament Ark of the Covenant. The unrestored Cosmati floor is in excellent condition.|$|E
25|$|The female plays {{no role in}} parental care; {{the male}} takes care of its young. Males will clean the eggs and the cavity with its fins and mouth. Males inspect eggs to remove diseased or {{infertile}} eggs, and aerates the clutch by fanning them with its pectoral and pelvic fins. During this time, a male usually will not leave the cavity to feed, or will leave only occasionally and quickly return. The eggs hatch in 4–10 days {{over a period of}} 2–6 hours; the male guards the eggs for 7–10 days after hatching. The fry remain in the cave, attaching to <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceiling</b> with their mouths, absorbing their yolk sac in 2–4 days and becoming free swimming.|$|E
25|$|Asar Mahal or palace was {{constructed}} in 1646 by the Adil Shahis. It is located {{to the east of}} the citadel. A bridge connects it and it is well preserved. It also known as Dad Mahal since it was initially used as hall of justice. It was later converted as reliquary and has become a highly revered place since it is said to hold two hairs from the beard of Prophet Mohammed. The portico has impressive wooden columns (four numbers of octagonal shape) and is double the normal height and has wooden panelled ceiling. It faces an artificial lake. <b>The</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the hall display landscape paintings. Women are prohibited from entering this Mahal.|$|E

25|$|Many of her MGM films, such as Million Dollar Mermaid and Jupiter's Darling, {{contained}} elaborately staged {{synchronized swimming}} scenes, with considerable risk to Williams. She broke her neck filming a 115ft dive off a tower during a climactic musical {{number for the}} film Million Dollar Mermaid and was in a body cast for seven months. She subsequently recovered, although she continued to suffer headaches {{as a result of}} the accident. Her many hours spent submerged in a studio tank resulted in ruptured eardrums numerous times. She also nearly drowned after not being able to find the trapdoor in the ceiling of a tank. <b>The</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceiling</b> were painted black and the trapdoor blended in. Williams was pulled out only because a member of the crew realized the door was not opening.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{remarkable}} findings in the tunnel chambers was a miniature mountainous landscape, 17 metres underground, with tiny pools of liquid mercury representing lakes. <b>The</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the tunnel were found to have been carefully impregnated with mineral powder composed of magnetite, pyrite known as fool's gold and hematite, providing a special brightness to the place and to give the effect of standing under the stars as a peculiar re-creation of the underworld. At the end of the passage Gómez Chávez’s team uncovered four greenstone statues, wearing garments and beads, and their open eyes would have shone with precious minerals. Two of the figurines were still in their original positions, leaning back and apparently contemplating up at the axis where the three planes of the universe meet - probably the founding shamans of Teotihuacan, guiding pilgrims to the sanctuary, and carrying bundles of sacred objects used to perform rituals, including pendants and pyrite mirrors, which were perceived as portals to other realms.|$|E
25|$|To {{the north}} of the ticket hall is an office and service room for the station manager. Parts of the timber framing to the ticket windows are visible on its {{south-eastern}} wall. The floors are carpeted and <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceiling</b> are lined with fibrous cement sheeting. The windows are double-hung sashes with interior sills made with a terrazzo different from that {{on the floor in the}} ticket hall. Adjacent to these rooms to the north is the semi-enclosed waiting area. Its floor has a terrazzo tile pattern to match that in the ticket hall. Its southern wall is face brick, while the remainder are plastered. On each side wall, there are two banks of the same double-hung sashes as in the office, with interior terrazzo sills. There is also some solid timber shelving here. The seating, which lines three walls, is made with timber slats and framing on shaped concrete legs. Two timber-framed and screen-infill doors, with matching surrounds provide entry from each side of the platform. At the northernmost end of the building are the toilets, which consist of two toilet cubicles and wash areas accessed by timber doors on the south-western and north-eastern sides. Metal framed louvres open off all three exterior walls at two metre sill height. Approximately one and a half metres from the north- eastern face of the building stands a cast iron drinking fountain. A number of timber and concrete seats, the same as those used in the northern waiting room, sit against the building on its long facades.|$|E

Like other major murti (statue) in this and other Badami caves, the Varaha artwork is set in a circle and symmetrically laid out; according to Alice Boner, the panel is an upright rectangle whose [...] "height is equal to the octopartite directing circle and sides are aligned to essential geometric ratios, in this case to the second vertical chord of the circle". <b>The</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceiling</b> have traces of colored paint, suggesting the cave used to have fresco paintings.|$|E
500|$|Lopez later {{confirmed}} {{in an interview}} On Air with Ryan Seacrest, that the completed music video would premiere jointly on season ten of American Idol and on Vevo on March 3,2011. Fans could vote between three alternative endings through Idols official website. Lopez said the idea behind giving fans the choice was {{to give them a}} chance to see what she experienced. [...] "You get to do what I do,... Like, I go in there with my videos and I start editing and picking all the shots I like and the things that I like and what I feel the best kind of feeling for the record is. You guys get to do that. We picked two different ones and we weren't sure." [...] The alternative endings included three varying scenes: in the first, the video ends with a close-up of Lopez's face in the silver lace catsuit; the second ends with a shot of dancers defying gravity on <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceiling,</b> while the final ending ends with a shot of Lopez on the dance floor in her harem pants.

2500|$|Van Zyl {{discovered}} that the front-right pallet was the [...] "seat" [...] of the fire. The manifest said that pallet mostly comprised computers in polystyrene packaging. The investigators said that the localised fire likely {{came in contact with}} the packaging and produced gases that accumulated near the ceiling. They also said that gases ignited into a flash fire that affected the entire cargo hold. The cargo fire of Flight 295 did not burn lower than one metre above the cargo floor. <b>The</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the cargo hold received severe fire damage. Van Zyl ended his investigation without discovering why the fire started.|$|E
2500|$|Vault: The crypt is in a vault at {{the base}} of the stairs.

When entering it is three steps down and then a short passageway into the hill and at the end of the passage is the brick-lined crypt. The crypt is approximately [...] square. There are a series of slate coffins inserted into a double-set of shelves on the right and left. Various bones are said to be sorted by type into different coffins, presumably because individual bodies could not be identified and re-assembled for burial.|$|E
