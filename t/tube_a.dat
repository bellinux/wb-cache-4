In 2015 {{a team in}} Italy built soft-bodied robots able to crawl and swim, requiring only minimal computation. In 2017 a German company made an arm with a soft pneumatically controlled silicone gripper fitted with two rows of suckers. It is able to grasp objects such as a metal <b>tube,</b> <b>a</b> magazine, or a ball, and to fill a glass by pouring water from a bottle.|$|E

5|$|Kates {{built the}} game to {{showcase}} his additron <b>tube,</b> <b>a</b> miniature version of the vacuum tube, though the transistor overtook it in computer development shortly thereafter. Patent issues prevented the additron tube from being used in computers besides Bertie before {{it was no longer}} useful. Bertie the Brain is a candidate for the first video game, as it was potentially the first computer game to have any sort of visual display of the game. It appeared only three years after the 1947 invention of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game to use an electronic display. Berties use of light bulbs rather than a screen with real-time visual graphics, however, much less moving graphics, does not meet some definitions of a video game.|$|E
5|$|For vertebrates, {{the early}} stages of neural {{development}} are similar across all species. As the embryo transforms from a round blob of cells into a wormlike structure, a narrow strip of ectoderm running along the midline of the back is induced to become the neural plate, the precursor of the nervous system. The neural plate folds inward to form the neural groove, and then the lips that line the groove merge to enclose the neural <b>tube,</b> <b>a</b> hollow cord of cells with a fluid-filled ventricle at the center. At the front end, the ventricles and cord swell to form three vesicles that are the precursors of the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. At the next stage, the forebrain splits into two vesicles called the telencephalon (which will contain the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures) and the diencephalon (which will contain the thalamus and hypothalamus). At about the same time, the hindbrain splits into the metencephalon (which will contain the cerebellum and pons) and the myelencephalon (which will contain the medulla oblongata). Each of these areas contains proliferative zones where neurons and glial cells are generated; the resulting cells then migrate, sometimes for long distances, to their final positions.|$|E
5|$|Glass welding is {{a common}} {{practice}} during glassblowing. It is used very often {{in the construction of}} lighting, neon signs, flashtubes, scientific equipment, and the manufacture of dishes and other glassware. It is also used during glass casting for joining the halves of glass molds, making items such as bottles and jars. Welding glass is accomplished by heating the glass through the glass transition, turning it into a thick, formable, liquid mass. Heating is usually done with a gas or oxy-gas torch, or a furnace, because the temperatures for melting glass are often quite high. This temperature may vary, {{depending on the type of}} glass. For example, lead glass becomes a weldable liquid at around , and can be welded with a simple propane torch. On the other hand, quartz glass (fused silica) must be heated to over , but quickly loses its viscosity and formability if overheated, so an oxyhydrogen torch must be used. Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass, allowing it to be blown into various shapes, such as bulbs, bottles, or tubes. When two pieces of liquid glass are pressed together, they will usually weld very readily. Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease. However, when welding a tube to another <b>tube,</b> <b>a</b> combination of blowing and suction, and pressing and pulling is used to ensure a good seal, to shape the glass, and to keep the surface tension from closing the tube in on itself. Sometimes a filler rod may be used, but usually not.|$|E

25|$|<b>Tube</b> {{drawing is}} <b>a</b> process to size <b>a</b> <b>tube</b> by {{shrinking}} <b>a</b> large diameter <b>tube</b> into <b>a</b> smaller one, by drawing the <b>tube</b> through <b>a</b> die. This process produces high-quality tubing with precise dimensions, good surface finish, and the added strength of cold working. For this reason {{this process is}} established for many materials, namely metalworking but also glass. Because it is so versatile, tube drawing is suitable for both large- and small-scale production. The large-scale production of glass typically uses a one step process where glass is directly drawn into <b>a</b> <b>tube</b> from <b>a</b> melting tank.|$|R

25|$|Gas {{chromatography}} {{is based}} on a partition equilibrium of analyte between a solid or viscous liquid stationary phase (often a liquid silicone-based material) and a mobile gas (most often helium). The stationary phase is adhered to the inside of a small-diameter (commonly 0.53 â€“ 0.18mm inside diameter) glass or fused-silica <b>tube</b> (<b>a</b> capillary column) or a solid matrix inside a larger metal <b>tube</b> (<b>a</b> packed column). It is widely used in analytical chemistry; though the high temperatures used in GC make it unsuitable for high molecular weight biopolymers or proteins (heat denatures them), frequently encountered in biochemistry, it is well suited for use in the petrochemical, environmental monitoring and remediation, and industrial chemical fields. It is also used extensively in chemistry research.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedHeat-transfer measurements {{were made for}} condensation of R- 113 and steam on <b>a</b> smooth <b>tube</b> and on three finned tubes with rectangular shape fins. These <b>tubes</b> had <b>a</b> fin height and width of 1. 0 mm and spacings of 0. 25, 1. 5, and 4. 0 mm (<b>tubes</b> <b>A,</b> B, and C respectively). Data were taken by increasing the vapor velocity from 0. 4 to 1. 9 m/s for R- 113 and 4. 8 to 31. 3 m/s for steam. For both fluids, {{the improvement of the}} condensing heat-transfer coefficient with vapor velocity was smaller for the finned tubes than for the smooth tube. For R- 113, the smooth <b>tube</b> experienced <b>a</b> 32 percent improvement with vapor velocity, where the finned <b>tubes</b> (<b>tubes</b> <b>A,</b> B and C respectively) experienced improvements of only 0, 5 and 10 percent. For steam, the smooth <b>tube</b> experienced <b>a</b> 62 percent improvement, whereas the finned <b>tubes</b> (<b>tubes</b> <b>A,</b> B, and C respectively) experienced improvements of only 31, 11, and 9 percent. These test results show that, although finned tubes can provide significant heat transfer enhancement over smooth tubes at low vapor velocities, the degree of enhancement becomes smaller as vapor velocity increases.

25|$|Double seam rims {{are crucial}} to the joining of the wall to a top or bottom surface. An {{extremely}} tight fit between the pieces must be accomplished to prevent leakage; the process of accomplishing this radically deforms the rims of the parts. Part of the tube that forms the wall is bent, almost at its end, turning outward through 90 degrees, and then bent further, {{toward the middle of}} the tube, until it is parallel {{to the rest of the}} <b>tube,</b> <b>a</b> total bend of 180 degrees.|$|E
25|$|X-rays can be {{generated}} by an X-ray <b>tube,</b> <b>a</b> vacuum tube that uses a high voltage to accelerate the electrons released by a hot cathode to a high velocity. The high velocity electrons collide with a metal target, the anode, creating the X-rays. In medical X-ray tubes the target is usually tungsten or a more crack-resistant alloy of rhenium (5%) and tungsten (95%), but sometimes molybdenum for more specialized applications, such as when softer X-rays are needed as in mammography. In crystallography, a copper target is most common, with cobalt often being used when fluorescence from iron content in the sample might otherwise present a problem.|$|E
25|$|The {{efficacy}} of fluorescent tubes ranges from about 16 {{lumens per watt}} for a 4 watt tube with an ordinary ballast to over 100 lumens per watt with a modern electronic ballast, commonly averaging 50 to 67lm/W overall. Most compact fluorescents above 13 watts with integral electronic ballasts achieve about 60lm/W. Lamps are rated by lumens after 100 hours of operation. For a given fluorescent <b>tube,</b> <b>a</b> high-frequency electronic ballast gives about a 10% efficacy improvement over an inductive ballast. It is necessary to include the ballast loss when evaluating the {{efficacy of}} a fluorescent lamp system; this can be about 25% of the lamp power with magnetic ballasts, and around 10% with electronic ballasts.|$|E
