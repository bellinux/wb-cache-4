5|$|Richard III was {{followed}} by another adaptation, the comedy, Love Makes a Man, which was constructed by splicing together <b>two</b> <b>plays</b> by John Fletcher: The Elder Brother and The Custom of the Country. Cibber's confidence was apparently restored {{by the success of}} the <b>two</b> <b>plays,</b> and he returned to more original writing.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Stanford in {{possession}} of the ball and facing second down and three from its 39-yard line. <b>Two</b> <b>plays</b> gained the Cardinal a first down, then Stanford committed a false-start penalty that pushed its offense back fiveyards. <b>Two</b> <b>plays</b> later, however, Luck completed a 58-yard pass to Fleener, who made up the lost yardage and far more as he raced down the field for a touchdown. The following extra point granted Stanford a 33–12 lead with 12:28 remaining.|$|E
5|$|Following the missed field goal, Air Force's offense began {{operations}} at its 24-yard line. Running back Anthony Butler broke free for an 18-yard gain {{on the third}} play of the drive, giving Air Force a first down. <b>Two</b> <b>plays</b> later, however, Harridge threw a pass that was intercepted by Tech linebacker Vegas Robinson. At {{the end of the}} play, Air Force committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty, which allowed the Tech offense to take over at the Air Force 15-yard line. Tech needed just <b>two</b> <b>plays</b> to drive the 15 yards and earn a touchdown, its first of the game. With 2:26 remaining in the quarter, Air Force's lead had been cut to 10–7.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, she {{performed}} in stage productions of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes at Carousel Theater and Bus Stop at Yonker Playhouse. Both co-starred Mickey Hargitay and were well-reviewed. Mansfield toured {{small towns in}} the US alternating between the <b>two</b> <b>plays.</b> In 1965, {{she performed}} in another pair of plays – Rabbit Habit at Latin Quarter and Champagne Complex at Pabst Theater. Both were directed by Matt Cimber and were poorly reviewed.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} fourth quarter began, the Virginia Tech drive {{that began in the}} waning moments of the third quarter came to an end. The Hokies were forced to punt, and Louisville began its first drive of {{the fourth quarter}}. The Cardinals' Harry Douglas ran for 29yards on their first play of the drive. On the second, Hunter Cantwell {{completed}} a 29-yard touchdown pass to Gary Barnidge. It took Louisville just 33seconds and <b>two</b> <b>plays</b> to travel 58yards and earn a touchdown. The score gave Louisville a 24–13 lead with 13:32 remaining to play. But just as it took Louisville just <b>two</b> <b>plays</b> to score, so too did it take Virginia Tech <b>two</b> <b>plays</b> to answer the Louisville touchdown. After taking over at his team's 22-yard line, Marcus Vick completed a 54-yard pass to wide receiver David Clowney. Virginia Tech and Louisville committed offsetting 15-yard personal foul penalties before the play, to no effect on the Hokie offense. On the next play after the long pass, Cedric Humes rushed for 24yards and the answering Hokie touchdown. It took just 28seconds for Virginia Tech to answer the Louisville touchdown. Having done that, Tech went Louisville one better, successfully scoring a two-point conversion on a pass from Vick to Morgan. The touchdown and two-point conversion cut the Louisville lead to 24–21.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies {{were forced}} to punt again, and Brent Bowden's 50-yard punt stuck the Eagles deep in their own territory. The drive began with a five-yard penalty against Boston College and culminated <b>two</b> <b>plays</b> later in a six-yard loss on a sack of Matt Ryan by Hokie defender Barry Booker. Boston College punted, but the kick by Johnny Ayers {{traveled}} just 34yards before sailing out of bounds.|$|E

5|$|Their {{frustration}} clearly apparent, the Virginia Tech offense fared {{no better}} on their next possession. <b>Two</b> <b>plays</b> were stopped for no gain, {{and the only}} positive play—a five-yard pass to Eddie Royal—was negated by a false start penalty. The Hokies were again forced to punt the ball away to Florida State, their fifth of the game. The punt allowed FSU to start at their own 46-yard line, and at first, the Seminoles were able to capitalize on that opportunity, showing some of the effectiveness that characterized their prior drive. Lorenzo Booker ran for 24yards on <b>two</b> <b>plays,</b> but afterwards, Drew Weatherford threw two incompletions. A false start penalty backed up the Seminoles, who were forced to punt after failing {{to pick up the}} first down. The kick was an excellent one, and Florida State's special teams were able to get downfield and stop the ball inside the Virginia Tech one-yard line, again hurting the Hokie offense.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{began the}} quarter in {{possession}} of the ball in Tennessee territory, attempting to capitalize upon a drive begun in the third quarter. Tennessee's defense, however, allowed only one yard on the first <b>two</b> <b>plays</b> of the quarter, and Tech placekicker Waldron returned to the field to convert a 46-yard field goal, extending Virginia Tech's lead to 27-14 with 13:33 left in the game.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's kickoff was downed for a touchback, and Tennessee {{started its}} drive from its 20-yard line. On the second {{play of the}} possession, Crompton {{completed}} a 40-yard pass to wide receiver Denarius Moore. The play gave Tennessee its first plays inside Virginia Tech territory, and the Volunteers capitalized on the field position. After two rushing plays were stymied for no gain or losses, Crompton completed a 15-yard pass to wide receiver Gerald Jones. Crompton was sacked on the next play, but <b>two</b> <b>plays</b> later completed a 20-yard throw to Jones, who ran out of bounds at the Tech 4-yard line, giving Tennessee another first down. <b>Two</b> <b>plays</b> later, running back Montario Hardesty ran forward four yards into the end zone, halving Virginia Tech's lead. After the extra point, Virginia Tech still led, 14-7, with 6:43 remaining in the first half.|$|E

5|$|With {{time running}} {{out in the}} third quarter, Clemson's offense entered the field of play at its 28-yard line. After a five-yard penalty for delay of game, the Tigers' Andre Ellington gained 41 yards on <b>two</b> <b>plays,</b> pushing into Georgia Tech territory. Those plays all but {{exhausted}} the quarter's remaining moments, however, and the third quarter ended with Georgia Tech still leading, 33–20.|$|E
5|$|After {{the third}} Louisville punt, Virginia Tech took over at its 46-yard line. Unlike the {{previous}} second-quarter possessions, which saw the Tech offense struggle {{to move the}} ball effectively, Tech began its drive with a five-yard rush. After losing seven yards on the next play, Marcus Vick completed a 19-yard pass to tight end Jeff King, driving the Hokies into Louisville territory {{for the first time}} in the quarter. <b>Two</b> <b>plays</b> later, Vick connected with wide receiver Justin Harper on a 33-yard pass that resulted in the Hokies' first touchdown of the game. With 4:56 remaining in the first half of the game, Tech trimmed Louisville's lead to 14–10.|$|E
5|$|Alabama {{opened the}} third quarter with a six-play, 75-yard drive that ended with a ten-yard Lacy {{touchdown}} run. On the kickoff that ensued, Demetrius Hart forced a fumble by Arkansas' Dennis Johnson that was recovered by Foster at the Razorbacks' 27-yard line. <b>Two</b> <b>plays</b> later, Alabama led 38–0 after T. J. Yeldon scored on a one-yard run. Arkansas responded with their longest drive of the game; however, it ended when Deion Belue forced a Knile Davis fumble that was recovered by Nick Perry at the Alabama 20-yard line. With {{the majority of the}} offensive starters pulled from the game, the Crimson Tide reserves led Alabama on a 15-play, 80-yard drive that ended with a 12-yard Kenyan Drake touchdown run early in the fourth quarter. The final touchdown of the game was set up late in the game after Knile Davis lost his second fumble of the game on a Jeoffrey Pagan tackle that was recovered by Denzel Devall. <b>Two</b> <b>plays</b> later, backup quarterback Blake Sims made the final score 52–0 with his 27-yard quarterback sneak for a touchdown.|$|E

The Steelers held them for no gain on the first <b>two</b> <b>plays</b> and Lawrence Timmons sacked Flacco on third down. The Steelers took over after a punt and Mewelde Moore caught a 24-yard reception to bring the Steelers to Baltimore's 31-yard line. Jeff Reed converted a 46-yard field goal {{to win the game}} for the Steelers. Reed was named the NFL's special teams player of the week. With the win the Steelers passed the Ravens for first place in the AFC North at 3–1, as well as extending their all-time record of 14consecutive home wins on Monday Night Football.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin's {{life has}} also {{been the subject of}} several stage productions. Two musicals, Little Tramp and Chaplin, were {{produced}} in the early 1990s. In 2006, Thomas Meehan and Christopher Curtis created another musical, , which was first performed at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego in 2010. It was adapted for Broadway two years later, re-titled Chaplin – A Musical. Chaplin was portrayed by Robert McClure in both productions. In 2013, <b>two</b> <b>plays</b> about Chaplin premiered in Finland: Chaplin at the Svenska Teatern, and Kulkuri (The Tramp) at the Tampere Workers' Theatre.|$|E
5|$|Clemson's post-score kickoff was {{returned}} to the Georgia Tech 15-yard line, where the Yellow Jackets began their first offensive possession. On the first <b>two</b> <b>plays</b> of the game, Georgia Tech running back Roddy Jones escaped the Clemson defense for gains of 21 yards and 22 yards, respectively. Those plays advanced the Yellow Jackets to the Clemson 42-yard line, where Georgia Tech began advancing by small gains. In three plays, Georgia Tech gained a first down, but two subsequent plays lost yardage before kicker Scott Blair came onto the field to attempt—and convert—a 48-yard field goal. The score narrowed Clemson's lead to 7–3 with the quarter exactly half elapsed.|$|E

5|$|Datta (2005) shows that, {{following}} {{the collapse of}} militaristic Boulangism in the late 1880s, the Napoleonic legend was divorced from party politics and revived in popular culture. Concentrating on <b>two</b> <b>plays</b> and two novels from the period—Victorien Sardou's Madame Sans-Gêne (1893), Maurice Barrès's Les Déracinés (1897), Edmond Rostand's L'Aiglon (1900), and André de Lorde and Gyp's Napoléonette (1913)—Datta examines how writers and critics of the Belle Époque exploited the Napoleonic legend for diverse political and cultural ends.|$|E
5|$|Following the Tech touchdown, Louisville {{attempted}} to answer with points {{of its own}} before halftime. After starting on his own 20-yard line, Hunter Cantwell completed two quick passes that resulted in 26yards. <b>Two</b> <b>plays</b> later, Michael Bush broke free for a 34-yard run, driving Louisville deep into the Virginia Tech side of the field. Despite having a first down at the Virginia Tech 18-yard line, Louisville was unable to gain any yards on three consecutive plays. Bush was stopped for no gain on a rushing attempt, and two Cantwell passes fell incomplete. Kicker Arthur Carmody came in to complete a 35-yard field goal, and with 2:16 remaining in the first half, Louisville led by a score of 17–10.|$|E
