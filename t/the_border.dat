Carpenter surveyed and marked <b>the</b> <b>border</b> between Arizona and Utah, completing the survey of borders making up the Four Corners Monument.|$|E

5|$|The {{closure of}} <b>the</b> <b>border</b> region for nearly 40years created {{a haven for}} {{wildlife}} in some places. Although parts of the East German side of <b>the</b> <b>border</b> were farmed, intensive farming of the kind practised elsewhere in Germany was absent and large areas were untouched by agriculture. Conservationists became aware {{as early as the}} 1970s that <b>the</b> <b>border</b> had become a refuge for rare species of animals and plants. Their findings led the Bavarian government to begin a programme of buying land along <b>the</b> <b>border</b> to ensure its protection from development.|$|E
5|$|The {{troops of}} the field armies and of <b>the</b> <b>border</b> armies had {{different}} arrangements for their accommodation. The {{troops of the}} field armies were often billeted on the civilian population, while the troops of <b>the</b> <b>border</b> armies had permanent bases.|$|E
5|$|There {{were many}} ways to die on the inner German border. Numerous escapees were shot by <b>the</b> <b>border</b> guards, while others were killed by mines and booby-traps. A {{substantial}} number drowned while trying to cross the Baltic and the Elbe river. Not all of those killed on <b>the</b> <b>border</b> were attempting to escape. On 13October 1961, Westfälische Rundschau journalist Kurt Lichtenstein was shot on <b>the</b> <b>border</b> {{near the village of}} Zicherie after he attempted to speak with East German farm workers. His death aroused condemnation across the political spectrum in West Germany. The incident prompted students from Braunschweig to erect a sign on <b>the</b> <b>border</b> protesting the killing.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Second World War, the East German side of <b>the</b> <b>border</b> was guarded {{initially}} by <b>the</b> <b>Border</b> Troops (Pogranichnyie Voiska) of the Soviet NKVD (later the KGB).

In 1961, the DGP was converted into a military force within the National People's Army (Nationale Volksarmee, NVA). The newly renamed Border Troops of the GDR (Grenztruppen der DDR, commonly nicknamed the Grenzer) came under the NVA's Border Command or Grenzkommando. They were responsible for securing and defending the borders with West Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Baltic Sea and West Berlin. At their peak, the Grenztruppen had up to 50,000personnel.|$|E
