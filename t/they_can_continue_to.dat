The ADF {{had intended to}} expand the CH-47F fleet at a later date, but the order was placed at short notice to use an under-spend on other Defence capabilities. All three helicopters were delivered in June 2016, two and half months earlier than planned. During the year the CH-47s were also approved to operate from the Canberra class vessels after trials proved successful. The 2016 Defence White Paper and its supporting documentation stated that the CH-47Fs will receive modifications to better enable them to perform aeromedical evacuation tasks by the 2025–26 financial year, {{and that it is}} intended to regularly upgrade the helicopters so that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> be supported through the US military's logistics system.|$|E
5|$|Celeste gives Natasha the waitressing job at Charlie's and {{she moves}} in with Summer and Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher), after her house is sold. Natasha also decides {{to drop out}} of her {{university}} course, upon realising that it is not right for her. Natasha meets Ed Lee (Sebastian Gregory) at Charlie's and offers to help him solve a maths equation, but he dismisses her. When she solves the problem, he invites her to a maths club. Natasha later transfers to his calculus course and Ed helps her with conditional probability, which they use to predict the outcome of a game of cards. They decide to play a game of Blackjack with a group of guys at Charlie's, but are forced to stop when a couple of police officers walks in. Natasha convinces Ed to hold a game at the Men's Shed, so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> test the theory and make some money.

25|$|Certain conditions, such as low {{concentrations}} of oxygen or high {{concentrations of}} species such as chloride which complete as anions, can interfere with a given alloy's ability to re-form a passivating film. In the worst case, {{almost all of the}} surface will remain protected, but tiny local fluctuations will degrade the oxide film in a few critical points. Corrosion at these points will be greatly amplified, and can cause corrosion pits of several types, depending upon conditions. While the corrosion pits only nucleate under fairly extreme circumstances, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> grow even when conditions return to normal, since the interior of a pit is naturally deprived of oxygen and locally the pH decreases to very low values and the corrosion rate increases due to an autocatalytic process. In extreme cases, the sharp tips of extremely long and narrow corrosion pits can cause stress concentration to the point that otherwise tough alloys can shatter; a thin film pierced by an invisibly small hole can hide a thumb sized pit from view. These problems are especially dangerous because they are difficult to detect before a part or structure fails. Pitting remains among the most common and damaging forms of corrosion in passivated alloys, but it can be prevented by control of the alloy's environment.|$|E

25|$|Gas vacuoles are membrane-bound, {{spindle-shaped}} vesicles, {{found in}} some planktonic bacteria and Cyanobacteria, that provides buoyancy to these cells by decreasing their overall cell density. Positive buoyancy is {{needed to keep the}} cells in {{the upper reaches of the}} water column, so that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> perform photosynthesis. They are made up of a shell of protein that has a highly hydrophobic inner surface, making it impermeable to water (and stopping water vapour from condensing inside) but permeable to most gases. Because the gas vesicle is a hollow cylinder, it is liable to collapse when the surrounding pressure increases. Natural selection has fine tuned the structure of the gas vesicle to maximise its resistance to buckling, including an external strengthening protein, GvpC, rather like the green thread in a braided hosepipe. There is a simple relationship between the diameter of the gas vesicle and pressure at which it will collapse - the wider the gas vesicle the weaker it becomes. However, wider gas vesicles are more efficient, providing more buoyancy per unit of protein than narrow gas vesicles. Different species produce gas vesicle of different diameter, allowing them to colonise different depths of the water column (fast growing, highly competitive species with wide gas vesicles in the top most layers; slow growing, dark-adapted, species with strong narrow gas vesicles in the deeper layers). The diameter of the gas vesicle will also help determine which species survive in different bodies of water. Deep lakes that experience winter mixing expose the cells to the hydrostatic pressure generated by the full water column. This will select for species with narrower, stronger gas vesicles.|$|E

50|$|Players {{can select}} {{the degree of}} {{starting}} difficulty any time a new game is started. The initial level chosen is a value between zero and twenty that determines the number of viruses to clear, and the three-game speed options change how fast the capsules fall in the bottle. The player's score is {{based solely on the}} elimination of viruses, not on the time taken to complete the level or the number of capsules used. If players complete the highest difficulty level, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>continue</b> playing <b>to</b> accumulate a higher score, but the number of viruses to clear remains the same. Additional points are awarded when multiple viruses are eliminated at once, but no additional points are awarded for initiating chain reactions, in which the elimination of one set of objects triggers the elimination of another set. The game speed is also a factor in how the game calculates scoring; higher speed levels yield more points.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The use {{of agents}} in today’s Internet world is {{expanding}} rapidly. Yet, agent developers proceed largely under the optimistic assumption that agents will be error-free. Errors may arise in agents for numerous reasons — agents may share a workspace with other agents or humans and updates made by these other entities may cause an agent {{to face a}} situation {{that it was not}} explicitly programmed to deal with. Likewise, errors in coding agents may lead to inconsistent situations where it is unclear how the agent should act. In this paper, we define an agent execution model that allows agents <b>to</b> <b>continuing</b> acting “reasonably ” even when some errors of the above types occur. More importantly, in our framework, agents take “repair ” actions automatically when confronted with such situations, but while taking such repair actions, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> often <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> engage in work and/or interactions with other agents that are unaffected by repairs. ...|$|R
50|$|First, {{each team}} must paddle a canoe across a giant lake to a puzzle. Once they finish that, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> {{head to a}} {{helicopter}}. Reaching the helicopter first is very important because it determines the penalty that teams will have <b>to</b> take before <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>continue</b> on <b>to</b> {{the second part of}} the challenge. The team that wins the first phase gets a two-minute headstart, the second-place finisher gets a one-minute headstart while the third-place finisher gets a 30-second headstart. The second phase of the challenge starts with a giant Sudoku puzzle, followed by a mountain bike ride except that the two bikes are tied together with a rope so the teams will have to stay together. After a puzzle that involves carrying color-coded logs to match a diagram, the teams must climb a very steep mountain, carrying a heavy bag. Once completed with a numbered puzzle, they're given helmets and an ice axe and have to climb the top of the mountain. The first team to climb up the mountain and reaches the flag, wins Fresh Meat II.|$|R

The most common practice {{is for a}} competitor to provide {{a certain number of}} rounds to the Range/ Safety Officers {{at the beginning of the}} match day. During the course of the match, the Range/Safety Officers at the chronograph station will pull a bullet from the competitor's ammunition and weigh it. When the competitor arrives at the chronograph station, they provide their pistol and an empty magazine to the Range/Safety Officer who loads a number of rounds into the magazine and fires them through the chronograph to determine the ammunition's velocity.

Individual personality characteristics of altruism, positive affectivity and locus of control are proposed as independent variables affecting one's motivation to mentor. Job satisfaction was the outcome of motivation that was explored in this study. Findings indicate that the individual personality characteristics discussed are significantly related to motivation to mentor and that job satisfaction with pay and promotion opportunities as well as satisfaction with the nature of the work are two salient outcomes reported by mentors. Theoretical and practical implications, limitations, and future directions are discussed...|$|R
