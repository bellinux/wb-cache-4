2500|$|When {{the tumult}} and the {{shouting}} die, when the bands are {{gone and the}} lights are dimmed, there is the stark reality of responsibility in an hour of history haunted with those gaunt, grim specters of strife, dissension, and materialism at home, and ruthless, inscrutable, and hostile power abroad.

[...] When she arrives in China to meet her sisters, June tells them the truth about Suyuan and embraces them. In finally accepting her Chinese heritage, June is able to make peace with her deceased mother.|$|E

60|$|What was his offence, {{he asked}} himself, as his brougham glided along the Embankment. Simply this: {{there had been}} a claim {{presented}} for his mine, which was, without doubt, a fraud, which few people would ever have believed in, and which, in a court of law, would have stood but little chance of success. What a fool he had been not to defy Sinclair, to go to his directors and <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> to resist stoutly any claim the man might bring! Since his first compromise with Rowan, everything had gone wrong. It was unworthy for a man in his position to have allowed Rowan even to play the ambassador, apart from anything else.
