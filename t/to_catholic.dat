5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>Catholic</b> teaching, this commandment {{does not}} {{preclude}} the use of God's name in taking solemn oaths administered by legitimate authority. However, lying under oath, invoking God's name for magical purposes, or voicing words of hatred or defiance against God are considered sins of blasphemy.|$|E
5|$|Response to {{the reforms}} was mixed. The {{religious}} houses {{had been the}} only support of the impoverished, and the reforms alienated much of the population outside London, helping to provoke the great northern rising of 1536–1537, known as the Pilgrimage of Grace. Elsewhere the changes were accepted and welcomed, and those who clung <b>to</b> <b>Catholic</b> rites kept quiet or moved in secrecy. They would re-emerge during the reign of Henry's daughter Mary (1553–1558).|$|E
5|$|The episode had few {{negative}} consequences. In 1908 Vizzini {{was able}} to acquire {{a substantial part of}} the Belici estate when he brokered a deal between the owner, the duke Francesco Thomas de Barberin who resided in Paris, and the local rural bank Cassa Rurale, whose president, the priest Scarlata, was Vizzini’s uncle. Vizzini held 290 hectares for himself and generously left the rest to the bank to lease out <b>to</b> <b>Catholic</b> peasants.|$|E

5|$|Another {{public outcry}} arose when the {{government}}, seeking {{the support of}} ethnic minorities, allowed the opening of over 80 Polish schools in Lithuania. At the time, the Polish government was closing Lithuanian schools in the fiercely contested Vilnius Region. The coalition government directly confronted the Christian Democrats when it proposed a 1927 budget that reduced salaries to the clergy and subsidies <b>to</b> <b>Catholic</b> schools. Further controversies were created when the government's military reform program was revealed as a careless downsizing. Some 200 conservative military officers were fired. The military began planning the coup.|$|E
5|$|Atangana {{travelled}} {{frequently in}} the French colonial period. He {{made a point of}} attending his subjects' weddings and funerals, for example. He had more opportunities to visit Europe, including the Paris Colonial Exposition in 1931 and the French Colonial Conference in 1935. In 1938, his wife died. Atangana was a handsome man by Ewondo standards: strong, well groomed, with a reputation as a good fighter, dancer, and husband. He remarried on 6 January 1940 to Julienne or Yuliana Ngonoa, a young Beti woman of the Mvog Manga sublineage from the village Nkolafamba. She bore him two children: Marie-Thérèse and René Grégoire. Atangana seems to have adhered <b>to</b> <b>Catholic</b> strictures against polygamy, despite the fact that other Beti chiefs at the time had several hundred wives.|$|E
5|$|Censors like Martin Quigley and Joseph Breen {{understood}} that:a {{private industry}} code, strictly enforced, {{is more effective}} than government censorship as a means of imposing religious dogma. It is secret, for one thing, operating at the pre-production stage. The audience never knows what has been trimmed, cut, revised, or never written. For another, it is uniform—not subject to hundreds of different licensing standards. Finally and most important, private censorship can be more sweeping in its demands, because it is not bound by constitutional due process or free-expression rules—in general, these apply to only the government—or by the command of church-state separation … {{there is no question that}} American cinema today is far freer than in the heyday of the Code, when Joe Breen's blue pencil and the Legion of Decency's ever-present boycott threat combined to assure that films adhered <b>to</b> <b>Catholic</b> Church doctrine.|$|E

5|$|Hayes {{hoped to}} remain out of {{politics}} {{in order to pay}} off the debts he had incurred during the Panic, but when the Republican state convention nominated him for governor in 1875, he accepted. The campaign against Democratic nominee William Allen focused primarily on Protestant fears of the possibility of state aid <b>to</b> <b>Catholic</b> schools. Hayes was against such funding and, while he was not known to be personally anti-Catholic, he allowed anti-Catholic fervor to contribute to the enthusiasm for his candidacy. The campaign was a success, and Hayes was returned to the governorship by a 5,544-vote majority. The first person to earn a third term as Governor of Ohio, Hayes reduced the state debt, re-established the Board of Charities, and repealed the Geghan Bill, which had allowed for the appointment of Catholic priests to schools and penitentiaries.|$|E
5|$|His Defensa de los curas de Riobamba {{was written}} in {{response}} to a report from Ignacio Barreto that accused the clergy in Riobamba of various unethical practices. Among other things, the report said that the large number of religious celebrations in Riobamba (frequented by Indians) were prejudicial <b>to</b> <b>Catholic</b> faith, agriculture, industry and the interests of the Crown; also, that priests demanded money from the Indians for entrance into churches and for certain ceremonies, that priests in Riobamba were immoral and finally that most sermons were incomprehensible to the Indians.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, the Mint gained {{its first}} female Director, Nellie Tayloe Ross, and despite initial mistrust {{between her and}} O'Reilly, they came to forge a strong bond. Although {{scheduled}} for mandatory retirement in 1935, O'Reilly {{was considered to be}} so indispensable to the bureau's operations that U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt postponed this until 1938. During her later years, O'Reilly remained in Washington D.C.; she no longer involved herself in Mint affairs, instead devoting much of her attention <b>to</b> <b>Catholic</b> charitable work.|$|E
50|$|Loë's {{promotion}} to field marshal was {{exceptional in that}} this honor was rarely given <b>to</b> <b>Catholics.</b> Traditionally a Protestant state, Prussia allowed few <b>Catholics</b> <b>to</b> rise that high in rank.|$|R

5|$|In {{contrast}} <b>to</b> <b>Catholic</b> {{allegations of}} rationalism and naturalism, Protestant objections {{are more likely}} to be based on allegations of mysticism, occultism, and even Satanism. Masonic scholar Albert Pike is often quoted (in some cases misquoted) by Protestant anti-Masons as an authority for the position of Masonry on these issues. However, Pike, although undoubtedly learned, was not a spokesman for Freemasonry and was also controversial among Freemasons in general. His writings represented his personal opinion only, and furthermore an opinion grounded in the attitudes and understandings of late 19th century Southern Freemasonry of the USA. Notably, his book carries in the preface a form of disclaimer from his own Grand Lodge. No one voice has ever spoken for the whole of Freemasonry.|$|E
5|$|Irish legislators {{began to}} comment {{publicly}} from 2003, some tentatively suggesting legislation, and some referring <b>to</b> <b>Catholic</b> teachings. Among the general public, reaction was favourable, with a 2005 online poll showing most respondents seeing some recognition as inevitable and acceptable. More rigorous public polls taken during 2006 showed an increasing {{majority of the}} population, up to 80%, supporting the introduction of some partnership rights for same-sex couples, with a slim majority favouring full marriage. The numbers in favour of adoption by same-sex couples were lower but less clear.|$|E
5|$|James VI's {{inheritance}} of the English crown in 1603 led to rule via the Privy Council from London. He also increasingly controlled the {{meetings of the}} Scottish General Assembly and increased the number and powers of the Scottish bishops. In 1618, he held a General Assembly and pushed through Five Articles, which included practices that had been retained in England but largely abolished in Scotland, most controversially kneeling for the reception of communion. Although ratified, they created widespread opposition and resentment and were {{seen by many as}} a step back <b>to</b> <b>Catholic</b> practice.|$|E

50|$|The Bourne Trust {{started out}} as the Catholic Prisoners Aid Society. It was {{established}} in 1898 by two Catholic lawyers, and the original aim was <b>to</b> help <b>Catholic</b> prisoners - although in practice, help was offered <b>to</b> <b>Catholics</b> and non-Catholics alike.|$|R

5|$|McCabe married Edna May Linton on 5 February 1935 at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, and {{the couple}} had two {{children}}, {{a son and a}} daughter, born in 1939 and 1950 respectively. The devout McCabe sent both of his children <b>to</b> <b>Catholic</b> boarding schools even though the family home was nearby. Plagued by ill-health in his middle age, McCabe’s fitness was further hindered by his feet, which prevented him from exercising. He thus gained a lot of weight, and heavy smoking wore down his body, as did the large amount of people who wanted to meet him. McCabe weakened significantly {{in the last two years}} of his life and was hospitalised for a period for liver problems. He was released from hospital soon before his death, but still aged 58, was a very frail man who moved very tentatively.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church {{teaches that}} {{marriage}} is a social and spiritual bond {{between a man and}} a woman, ordered towards the good of the spouses and procreation of children; according <b>to</b> <b>Catholic</b> teachings on sexual morality, it is the only appropriate context for sexual activity. A Catholic marriage, or any marriage between baptised individuals of any Christian denomination, is viewed as a sacrament. A sacramental marriage, once consummated, cannot be dissolved except by death. The Church recognises certain conditions, such as freedom of consent, as required for any marriage to be valid; In addition, the Church sets specific rules and norms, known as canonical form, that Catholics must follow.|$|E
5|$|Written {{at a time}} of {{religious}} upheaval, and {{in the wake of the}} English Reformation, the play is alternately Catholic (or piously medieval) and Protestant (or consciously modern). The ghost describes himself as being in purgatory, and as dying without last rites. This and Ophelia's burial ceremony, which is characteristically Catholic, make up most of the play's Catholic connections. Some scholars have observed that revenge tragedies come from traditionally Catholic countries, such as Spain and Italy, where they present a contradiction of motives, since according <b>to</b> <b>Catholic</b> doctrine the duty to God and family precedes civil justice. Hamlet's conundrum, then, is whether to avenge his father and kill Claudius, or to leave the vengeance to God, as his religion requires.|$|E

5|$|Another issue arose when Cardinal Norman Gilroy {{presented}} Heffron in September 1962 with a {{plan for}} State aid <b>to</b> <b>Catholic</b> Church schools, including assistance for teacher salaries and capital grants for buildings, an issue that was highly explosive in the sectarian politics of New South Wales at the time. Heffron, alive {{to the need for}} a limited form of state support to placate sectarian conflict that could destroy the government, permitted Treasurer Jack Renshaw to include state support for school laboratories and a means-tested allowance to school students in the 1963 budget. Heffron later dropped the school laboratory provision but his permitting of the means-tested allowance provoked condemnation from the Federal Party Executive in Adelaide on 30 September 1962, who were less interested in placating the traditional Catholic hierarchy and more informed by the bitterness of the earlier ALP/DLP split in the party in 1955. Heffron and Renshaw backed down on this last provision, leaving no state aid for Catholic schools, and affirming the dominance of the Federal party in such matters.|$|E
5|$|Christianity has a {{long history}} in present-day Turkey, which is the birthplace of {{numerous}} Christian Apostles and Saints, such as Paul of Tarsus, Timothy, Nicholas of Myra, Polycarp of Smyrna and many others. Saint Peter founded one of the first churches in Antioch (Antakya), the location of which is regarded by tradition as the spot where he first preached the Gospel, and where the followers of Jesus were called Christians {{for the first time in}} history. The house where Virgin Mary lived the final days of her life until her Assumption (according <b>to</b> <b>Catholic</b> doctrine) or Dormition (according to Orthodox belief), and the tomb of John the Apostle who accompanied her during the voyage to Anatolia after the crucifixion of Jesus, are in Ephesus. The cave churches in Cappadocia were among the hiding places of early Christians during the Roman persecutions against them. The Eastern Orthodox Church has been headquartered in Constantinople (Istanbul) since the First Council of Constantinople in 381 AD. Two of the five major episcopal sees of the Pentarchy (Constantinople and Antioch) instituted by Justinian the Great in 531 AD were located in present-day Turkey during the Byzantine period.|$|E
5|$|Cẩn's {{diabetes}} worsened {{during the}} course of the trial, and by the time he was executed, his elderly mother had died. He suffered a heart attack while in custody. On 9 May 1964, was carried on a stretcher into the prison courtyard and assisted by guards and two Catholic priests to stand alongside the post to which he was tied. He was blindfolded against his request and shot in front of approximately 200 spectators. Lodge defended his actions, claiming the United States did all it could to prevent the execution. The ambassador claimed Cẩn would have been allowed to seek refuge at the U.S. embassy, despite the fact that he had ordered Conein to intercept Cẩn at the airport. Rev. Cao Văn Luân, Catholic rector of Huế University who had been fired for falling afoul of the powerful Archbishop Thục, asked Lodge that Cẩn not be executed. According to Luân, Lodge reportedly assured the rector the execution would not take place. Cẩn left his personal fortune, which had indeed been deposited in foreign banks, <b>to</b> <b>Catholic</b> charities.|$|E
