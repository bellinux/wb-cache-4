This paper {{is linked to}} a doctoral study focussing {{on the impact of}} international networking and knowledge exchange on the professional identity of teachers. The perspective is shaped by the author’s experience of teacher union activity and involvement in international networking related to work for the British Council and the International Teacher Leadership initiative as well as on a twenty year career as a teacher. This paper involves analysis of data drawn from interviews with three teachers from Britain who have been involved in working with fellow teachers from other nations largely teachers from the Balkans. It explores {{the extent to which these}} teachers share a common professional identity with teachers from other nations and also whether this therefore constitutes a professional community. The paper includes a consideration of the implications for international networks and international <b>teacher</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>programmes.</b> It is also envisaged that the paper will support a discussion about ways in which the cultivation of international links may contribute to the global 'Education for All' campaign...|$|R

In {{consequence}} the graduating and post-graduating educations are forming more mobile and globalised students <b>exchange</b> <b>programmes.</b> The Malmö University, Department of Nursing offers students and <b>teachers</b> a continuous <b>exchange</b> <b>programme</b> within international <b>exchange</b> networks. The <b>programmes</b> contain lectures, seminars, debates and social events focusing on improvements of patient care. However, {{after many years of}} this <b>exchange</b> <b>programmes</b> there is still lack of knowledge about its efficiency and its benefits to the students’ professional role development. Through a qualitative methodology, the study explores how students´ experience of international exchange as a professional learning environment influence their nursing skills. The preliminary results show that students during their <b>exchange</b> <b>programmes</b> perceived a broader view of nursing and the nature of care. The students reported some memorable aspects during their international exchange period that facilitated them widen insights to nursing in various social contexts and health care systems. Some of these experiences were reported as challenging their attitudes and influential on their selection of further career direction...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This article {{discusses}} some {{perspectives on}} citizenship education in Turkey and Britain {{in the context}} of current contested discourses on the nature of European identity and of the European Union (EU). It is based on data collected during an EU-funded student <b>teacher</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>programme</b> between three universities in Turkey and Leicester University in the United Kingdom. The programme facilitated participants ’ investigations of their understandings of citizenship and citizenship education in Britain and Turkey. Data was collected by questionnaire from 581 Turkish student teachers and 85 British student teachers involved with citizenship education and, during the exchange visits, through focus group interviews with 14 British and 14 Turkish students. Both groups thought citizenship education was key to creating ‘good citizens ’ in their countries, but the nature of this citizenship was perceived to differ between countries. The Turkish students placed a strong emphasis on national identity and Turkish citizenship, whilst the British students focused more on democracy, social justice, global citizenship and human rights. Students from both countries questioned the efficacy of the pedagogical approaches that they observed during school visits in each other’s countries...|$|E

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of globalisation, {{more and more}} Chinese students choose {{to engage in the}} <b>exchange</b> <b>programme</b> for an international vision and education experience. Many researchers have explored benefits and drawbacks of <b>exchange</b> <b>programme</b> for the students, however, there is still a lack of research concerning the value co-creation in <b>exchange</b> <b>programme</b> for Chinese students. Hence, take the <b>exchange</b> <b>programme</b> provided by the University of Nottingham as an example, this research aims to investigate the marketing concept of value co-creation in British higher education sector, especially the value co-creation in <b>exchange</b> <b>programme</b> for Chinese students. In order to achieve the aim of this study, the qualitative in-depth semi-structured interview was applied with documentary data about the <b>exchange</b> <b>programme</b> within the University of Nottingham. The primary data was collected from the total of twenty-one participants, who had studied in the University of Nottingham as an exchange student for at least one semester, and the secondary data was mainly from the official website of University of Nottingham in the International section. Based on the findings, it showed that the Value Co-Creation of <b>Exchange</b> <b>Programme</b> at the University of Nottingham for Chinese students is successful to a large extent, by analysing the documentary data about the programme offered and the Chinese students’ response to the interview. The study gives new perspectives for British education in <b>exchange</b> <b>programme,</b> particularly for Chinese students. It provides British universities with a better understanding when co-create value with the Chinese students. Finally, future additional research area is recommended in the British higher education sector by value co-creation...|$|R

40|$|The {{international}} exchange of students {{plays an important}} role in acquisition of new knowledge and skills. However, it was possible to start implementing such <b>exchange</b> <b>programmes</b> at the Riga Technical University only in 1991 after the reestablishment of the Department of Geodesy.  Currently, the Riga Technical University cooperates with several countries in implementing <b>exchange</b> <b>programmes</b> of students. The main problems encountered in this process are similar: inadequate foreign language skills, a lack of internationally recognized coursebooks and other study materials, insufficient cooperation between the universities that implement <b>exchange</b> <b>programmes.</b> These problems should be addressed by creating a working group and expanding cooperation, as well as enhancing requirements for students who participate in the <b>exchange</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|R
40|$|International student <b>exchange</b> <b>programmes</b> are {{acknowledged}} as {{one aspect of}} a broader suite of internationalisation strategies aimed at enhancing students' intercultural understanding and competence. The decision {{to participate in an}} <b>exchange</b> <b>programme</b> is dependent on both individual and contextual factors such as student <b>exchange</b> policies and <b>programmes</b> of the home university. The aim of the current study was to demonstrate the relationship between participation rates in Australian university <b>exchange</b> <b>programmes</b> and the presence of a clear strategic goal specific to student exchange. While there was a significant relationship between the specific strategic goal of student <b>exchange</b> and <b>programme</b> participation rates, the implementation process appears to play a greater role in influencing student participation. It is suggested that the success of an <b>exchange</b> <b>programme</b> is moderated by organisational factors such as leadership and organisational culture, national government international education policies, and the level of resourcing and accountability.
