Three experiments were conducted when soil was saturated with deionised water and subsequently deionised water, <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> and sodium citrate were used as purging solutions at anode end. One experiment was conducted when the soil was saturated with <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> and itself was used as the purging solution. Results showed that 49 % reduction of cadmium concentration was achieved in the case of soil saturated (washed) with <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> as well as purging solution also was <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate.</b> The soil pH and washing solutions were the most important factors in controlling the removal of cadmium in electrokinetic remediation process...|$|R

40|$|Municipal {{solid waste}} {{incinerator}} (MSWI) bottom ash often cannot be recycled as construction material in Flanders, because leaching of Cu exceeds the limit value of 0. 5 mg/kg. Leaching of other components such as Mo and Sb is critical as well, but limit values for these elements are to date only informal. A treatment technique was investigated to lower pollutant leaching: extraction with solutions of organic complexants to remove Cu. Six different solutions were used, of which washing with citric acid and <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> decreases Cu leaching to below the limit value. Extraction was then performed with different concentrations of <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate.</b> Subsequent washing of the extracted material with distilled water {{appears to be}} vital to remove all residual <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate.</b> Extraction with a 0. 2 M solution of <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> followed by three washing steps decreases metal leaching to below the limit values.

In the prepared Si 3 N 4 -TiN composites, TiN grains were formed from TiO 2 and AlN powders during the sintering process, in which <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> {{was used as}} a dispersant for raw TiO 2 powders. The microstructures of the Si 3 N 4 -TiN composites with the increase of <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} was carried out to {{elucidate}} {{the effect of a}} single episode of oxidative stress on pyramidal neurons of the rat hippocampus. A significant {{increase in the number of}} neurons that were immunolabeled for the toxic lipid peroxidation product, 4 -hydroxynonenal (HNE) was observed in field CA 3 of the hippocampus, at 1 day, 7 days and 14 days after intracerebroventricular injection of 1 μL of 5 mM ferrous <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate,</b> compared to <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> injected controls at these time points. The number of HNE positive cells was fewer at 14 days, compared to 1 day, after ferrous <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> injection. The changes in HNE imunoreactivity were paralleled by changes in cytoplasmic phospholipase A 2 (cPLA 2) labeling in the pyramidal neurons in adjacent sections, suggesting that some of the HNE could have arisen as a result of peroxidation of arachidonic acid that was released by cPLA 2. Interestingly, despite the HNE and cPLA 2 labeling, no loss of neurons was observed in adjacent Nissl and Fluoro-Jade stained sections. Electron microscopy also showed that the HNE or cPLA 2 labeled cells had features of injured neurons, rather than necrotic neurons. The reduction of HNE immunoreactivity in neurons at 14 days after oxidative injury, and the absence of cell loss at any of the time intervals, shows that hippocampal pyramidal neurons have remarkable ability to recover from a single episode of oxidative stress, if repeated injury such as seizures / excitotoxicity could be avoided...|$|R

The enzyme was capable of mobilizing iron from different sources such as ferric <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate,</b> ferritin, and transferrin by reduction of the metal. The purified reductase had a calculated Mr of 17, 000, was sensitive to proteinase K treatment, and had an isoelectric point of pH 9. Analysis of the amino acid composition revealed glycine, serine, asparagine (or aspartic acid), and glutamine (or glutamic acid) as the most frequently occurring residues.

40|$|The {{growth of}} {{crystalline}} anodie aluminum oxide during anodization i an aqueous <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> electrolyte has been investigated. Crystalline sites were observed to nucleate {{only during the}} early growth of the oxide film, and their number was dependent upon the electrolyte temperature and the crystallographic orientation of the electro-polished aluminum substrate. As anodization continued, the crystalline sites grew larger but did not increase in number; eventually, the individual sites grew {{together to form a}} continuous crystalline sheet. It is postulated that the initial crys-talline sites grow radially outward by field-assisted transformation f the surrounding amorphous oxide into crystalline oxide. Transition layers observed between the amorphous and crystalline areas of the film are interpreted as intermedi-ate stages of the amorphous to crystalline transformation.
