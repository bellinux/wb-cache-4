5|$|While English is a subject-prominent language, at the {{discourse}} level {{it tends to}} use a topic-comment structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally {{has to be the}} grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, the girl was stung by the bee. Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there, e.g. it was the girl that the bee stung, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> who was stung by a bee. Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., it is raining) or in existential clauses (there are many cars on the street). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.|$|E
500|$|The band's early tour {{vehicle was}} a [...] "tiny V6 that was running on three cylinders, {{and it was}} not getting enough air, so it would drive really slowly," [...] {{recalled}} Wentz. [...] "We had to turn on the hot air to reach the speed limit, so we had the heat on all the time in 120 degree weather. It was so hot it melted the plastic molding around the windows. When it rained, we'd get all wet." [...] John Janick of Fueled by Ramen had heard an early version of a song online and cold-called the band members at their apartment, first reaching Stump and later talking to Wentz for an hour. Rob Stevenson from Island Records eventually offered the band a [...] "first-ever incubator sort of deal," [...] in which they gave the band money to sign with Fueled by Ramen for the group's one-off debut, knowing they could [...] "upstream" [...] the band to radio on the sophomore record. Fueled by Ramen, at the time the smallest of independent labels clamoring to sign the band, would effectively release the group's debut album and help build the band's ever-expanding fanbase before the group moved to Island. The band again partnered with O'Keefe at Smart Studios, bringing together the three songs from the demo and recording an additional seven songs in nine days. The band, according to Stump, didn't [...] "sleep anywhere that we could shower [...] <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> that Andy's girlfriend at the time went to school with who let us sleep on her floor, but we'd be there for maybe four hours at a time. It was crazy." [...] As the band progressed and the members' roles became more defined, Wentz took lyrics extremely seriously in contrast to Stump, who had been the group's primary lyricist up to that point. Arguments during the recording sessions led to what [...] "most reductively boils down to Wentz writing the lyrics and Stump writing the melodies." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, an American nurse {{committed}} suicide and the Paranoid album {{was found on}} her turntable. The album's possible influence in her decision to commit suicide was mentioned in the inquest, but ultimately {{it was decided that}} Black Sabbath were not to blame for her death. [...] "A lot of the words in the songs a lot of the moods of the songs are aggressive," [...] Iommi acknowledged. [...] "Especially in the early days Satanic, if you like... That was the way it felt, so that was the way we played. But it got out of hand. With Paranoid in England, for instance. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> found dead a nurse she was: dead in her room with our album on the turntable going round.
