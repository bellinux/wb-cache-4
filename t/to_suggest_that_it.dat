5|$|After Pantjawarna, Fred Young drew Njoo and {{his wife}} to the newly {{established}} Majestic Film. Deprived of their director and main star, Oriental hired the journalist Sutan Usman Karim to direct their fourth production, Panggilan Darah (Call of Blood). This film, written by Karim and starring Dhalia and Soerip, told of two young orphans {{as they tried to}} eke a living in Batavia. This film, which debuted in June 1941, prominently featured the cigarette factory Nitisemito, leading the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may have paid for the advertisement. He records it as a modest success, although he notes that reviews were mixed.|$|E
5|$|The {{apparition}} of 12BC {{was recorded}} in the Book of Han by Chinese astronomers of the Han Dynasty who tracked it from August through October. It passed within 0.16AU of Earth. Halley's appearance in 12BC, {{only a few years}} distant from the conventionally assigned date of the birth of Jesus Christ, has led some theologians and astronomers <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> might explain the biblical story of the Star of Bethlehem. There are other explanations for the phenomenon, such as planetary conjunctions, and there are also records of other comets that appeared closer to the date of Jesus' birth.|$|E
5|$|A related {{study also}} noted a locking {{mechanism}} {{in the lower}} jaw shared between the two genera. In a separate paper, Currie noted the possibility that Alioramus might represent a juvenile Tarbosaurus, but stated that the much higher tooth count and more prominent nasal crests in Alioramus suggest it is a distinct genus. Similarly, Currie uses the high tooth count of Nanotyrannus <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may be a distinct genus, rather than a juvenile Tyrannosaurus as most other experts believe. However, the discovery and description of Qianzhousaurus reveals that Alioramus is not a close relation to Tarbosaurus, instead belonging to a newly described family of tyrannosaurids; the Alioramini. Qianzhousaurus further reveals that similar long-snouted tyrannosaurids were widely distributed throughout Asia and would have shared the same environment while avoiding competition with larger and more robust tyrannosaurines by hunting different prey.|$|E
40|$|What is {{the crux}} of the Government's case for its {{industrial}} relations reforms? In statements by senior ministers over the past few weeks, one point comes up repeatedly: {{that the only way to}} maintain employment growth is to reduce protection for employees. It's one of those commonsense claims that often aren't examined too closely. And there's no evidence <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> true...|$|R

5|$|In 1994, tomato systemin {{was found}} to bind to a 50KDa protein in the cell {{membrane}} of tomato. The protein has a structure similar to proteases of the Kex2p-like prohormone convertases. This led Schaller and Ryan <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is not a receptor, but instead {{is involved in the}} processing of ProSys into the active form, or the degradation of Sys. Synthetic forms of tomato systemin, with substituted amino acids at the predicted dibasic cleavage site, remained stable in cell cultures for longer than the native form. Later studies have noted that the enzymes responsible for processing ProSys remain unidentified. No further research has been reported on the 50KDa protein to date, and the gene has not been identified.|$|E
5|$|All {{copies of}} Hymn {{are found in}} manuscripts of the Historia ecclesiastica or its {{translation}}, where they serve as either a gloss to Bede's Latin translation of the Old English poem, or, {{in the case of}} the Old English version, a replacement for Bede's translation in the main text of the History. Despite this close connection with Bede's work, the Hymn does not appear to have been transmitted with the Historia ecclesiastica regularly until relatively late in its textual history. Scribes other than those responsible for the main text often copy the vernacular text of the Hymn in manuscripts of the Latin Historia. In three cases, Oxford, Bodleian Library, Laud Misc. 243, Oxford, Bodleian Library, Hatton 43, and Winchester, Cathedral I, the poem is copied by scribes working a quarter-century or more after the main text was first set down. Even when the poem is in the same hand as the manuscript's main text, there is little evidence <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was copied from the same exemplar as the Latin Historia: nearly identical versions of the Old English poem are found in manuscripts belonging to different recensions of the Latin text; closely related copies of the Latin Historia sometimes contain very different versions of the Old English poem. With the exception of the Old English translation, no single recension of the Historia ecclesiastica is characterised by the presence of a particular recension of the vernacular poem.|$|E

As Richard Lancelyn Green notes, [...] "there is no {{evidence}} to show <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is by Doyle and strong internal evidence <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> not". Various authors have attempted to complete the story (named [...] "The Adventure of the Tall Man" [...] by Peter Haining) and put it alongside the canon. Some are very close to Doyle’s plot, others include variations from it. [...] However no 'official' completion has been made (In the same way as The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes was intended as an official continuation of the canon).|$|R

A 16 July 1940 Luftwaffe intelligence report failed to even mention it, in spite of being aware of it through signals intercepts, and having complete details of its World War I predecessor. A later report on 7 August did make mention of the system, but only <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would tie fighters to their sectors, reducing their flexibility and ability to deal with large raids.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} brokering is usually aligned with a {{business}} model of an intermediary helping the customer/client with their decisions/choices. As knowledge becomes increasingly accessible, and of varied origins, quality and veracity, the number of professionals engaged in knowledge brokering is simultaneously increasing. This paper considers if teachers should also regard themselves and become skilled as knowledge brokers. Set {{in the context of}} proliferating websites, blogs, products and services available for access/purchase by health and physical education (HPE) teachers and their students, questions about what is knowledge, where it is generated and how it is filtered and evaluated are raised as a prelude <b>to</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may be time for HPE teachers to act as effective knowledge brokers consistent with the pressures and practices of neoliberalism...|$|R
25|$|The {{negative}} {{outcome of}} the Michelson–Morley experiment (1887) suggested that the aether was non-existent, findings which were confirmed in subsequent experiments through the 1920s. This led to considerable theoretical work to explain the propagation of light without an aether. A major breakthrough was the theory of relativity, which could explain why the experiment failed to see aether, but was more broadly interpreted <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not needed. The Michelson-Morley experiment, along with the blackbody radiator and photoelectric effect, was a key experiment {{in the development of}} modern physics, which includes both relativity and quantum theory, the latter of which explains the wave-like nature of light.|$|E
25|$|Of the 51 inhumations {{excavated}} in the 1980s, 36 {{were found}} to contain grave goods, and 14 were not. One burial had been partially destroyed, meaning what excavators {{did not know if}} it had once been accompanied with grave goods. Around 140 artefacts were uncovered from this excavation, most of which were personal ornaments, weapons, or domestic items. Philp believed that those inhumations containing spearheads, seaxes, or a shield would have been high status burials at the time. Only one burial, designated Grave 1 in the 1984 excavation, contained a shield. Also containing a spear, it was located at the far east of the cemetery, leading Philp <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> might have had particular significance.|$|E
25|$|Finally after Australia {{ended their}} innings on 323, the Indian openers Chopra and Virender Sehwag faced the uphill task of facing 35 overs of {{high-quality}} swing and seam bowling, which was {{aided by a}} track which had enough grass on it <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would assist seam movement. Further, the overcast and gloomy skies did not bode too well for the Indian openers. Taking advantage of these conditions {{and the fact that}} Chopra was playing in only his third test, Jason Gillespie produced an incisive spell of bowling. His very first ball indicated {{that there would be a}} touch of outswing for him. He stuck the right length time and again, and he beat Chopra's edge frequently, making him play and miss. However, if he was beaten, Chopra did not betray any sign of that fact and played out the two frontline bowlers with assurance. Sehwag was beaten time and again by Nathan bracken, who, despite playing only his first test, generated a lot of bounce with his natural high-arm action and dominated Sehwag throughout. Sehwag, though treated his sluggish start without the slightest care and played on with nonchalance. Both of the openers made five each and India had reached 11/0 from 6.1 overs when play was concluded at that stage.|$|E

25|$|The first Roman {{frontier}} in {{the north}} and west of the island was marked by watchtowers and military camps, or castra, along the Fosse Way. This has led many historians <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> served as the permanent border {{in the early years of}} Roman occupation. However, it is more likely that the boundary between Roman and Celtic Britain fluctuated markedly during this period. In Eburacum in 71 AD, a wood and earth military camp was built by the Legio IX Hispana to secure the northern region. Following the defeat of the Welsh tribes, Agricola’s army advanced against particularly warlike Pictish tribes in the inhabited areas {{in the north}}. In 79, his soldiers reached the Tanaus (or Taus; its location is unknown today, but it could have been the Firth of Tay) and established several camps. In 80 AD, Agricola secured his conquests further, and built a row of defensive camps across a narrow neck in the north of Britain where the inlets of the sea cut deeply into the island between what Tacitus had called Clota (the Firth of Clyde) and Bodotria (the Firth of Forth). In 82, he moved with his troops and a unit of the fleet along the east coast of Scotland, into the regions north of the Firth of Forth. To support this incursion he built bases such as Pinnata Castra, a legion camp near Inchtuthil. Subsequently he tried to secure the north permanently with further fortifications on the so-called Gask Ridge. However, the expenditure on military equipment and logistics and the losses in this endless fighting greatly outweighed the benefits gained. After his recall, Caledonia, with its harsh climate and sparse resources, was once again left to itself and the Romans restricted themselves to securing the most fertile and economically attractive regions of the island. Moreover, the troops tied up in Britannia were increasingly needed on the continent to defend the Rhine and Lower Danube from Germanic and Dacian attacks.|$|E

In contrast, in his book The Rocket: A Cultural History of Maurice Richard, Benoît Melançon disputes the importance of the riot, stating its perceived importance in history grew retroactively with Richard's myth. Melançon wrote: [...] "According to this popular narrative, {{for the first time the}} people of Quebec stood up for themselves; especially English Canada delights in anachronistically announcing that this was the beginning of the 1960s Quiet Revolution." ...|$|E
