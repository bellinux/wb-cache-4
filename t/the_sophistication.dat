5|$|Historian {{of science}} Thierry Bardini argues that Engelbart's complex {{personal}} philosophy (which drove all his research) foreshadowed the modern {{application of the}} concept of coevolution to the philosophy and use of technology. Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the principle of linguistic relativity developed by Benjamin Lee Whorf. Where Whorf reasoned that <b>the</b> <b>sophistication</b> of a language controls <b>the</b> <b>sophistication</b> of the thoughts that can be expressed by a speaker of that language, Engelbart reasoned that the state of our current technology controls our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn will control our ability to develop new, improved technologies. He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work.|$|E
5|$|Some {{groups in}} Japan, {{particularly}} those active in Tokyo, also {{emphasize the importance}} of the lively and spirited iki aesthetic. In taiko, it refers to very specific kinds of movement while performing that evoke <b>the</b> <b>sophistication</b> stemming from the mercantile and artisan classes active during the Edo period (1603–1868).|$|E
5|$|Advances in {{bacteriology}} in the 20th century increased <b>the</b> <b>sophistication</b> of possible bio-agents in war. Biological sabotage—in {{the form of}} anthrax and glanders—was undertaken {{on behalf of the}} Imperial German government during World War I, with indifferent results. In World War II, Britain weaponised tularemia, anthrax, brucellosis, and botulism toxins, but never used them.|$|E
30|$|To {{disprove}} {{the null}} hypothesis we create a linear model. The model aims at explaining a shop’s retention rate at increasing distances. Then, we characterize the shop’s size using three different measures. The first measure is the total volume of its sales, i.e. {{the number of items}} that have been purchased in the shop. A larger shop generates high volumes of sales. The second measure is the shop’s variety or assortment, i.e. the number of different products that can be purchased in the shop. Larger shops have a larger assortment of products. The last measure is <b>the</b> shop’s <b>sophistication.</b> <b>The</b> shop’s <b>sophistication</b> can be viewed as <b>the</b> average <b>sophistication</b> of <b>the</b> products sold at the shop, {{in the same way as}} <b>the</b> country <b>sophistication</b> is <b>the</b> average <b>sophistication</b> of <b>the</b> products it exports [7].|$|R
40|$|Medical {{practice}} is in crisis - <b>the</b> <b>sophistications</b> are enormous and expensive, and the outcomes leave {{much to be}} desired. An epistemologic evaluation that weighs the scope and limitations of any -pathy or any procedure {{seems to be the}} need of the day. As an example, described herein is the logic of such an exercise; and a sample of the exercise itself, taking cancer as an example...|$|R
30|$|In [21] {{we address}} {{possible}} objections {{such as the}} influence between distance and number of products bought, which may invalidate the effect of <b>the</b> Product <b>Sophistication.</b> We also show that <b>the</b> average <b>Sophistication</b> of different shop types (we recall that there are three, in decreasing order of size and Sophistication: iper, super and gestin) influence the average distance of their customers. For compactness, we point to that paper for this additional material and we conclude this section by remarking that <b>the</b> average <b>sophistication</b> of <b>the</b> products in a shop is influencing customers’ decisions: when they need a more sophisticated product they are prone to decide {{to go to a}} larger shop with higher sophistication.|$|R
5|$|In 1993, Sindy was {{featured}} in a £500,000 advertising campaign for the fashion company Alexon Group. Sindy was used to contrast her childish fashion with <b>the</b> <b>sophistication</b> of Alexon's fashion range. Each double page spread showed Sindy in a typical outfit superimposed on a real-life setting. The opposite page showed a real woman dressed in Alexon's clothes above the line 'Dressing up for grown ups'.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sophistication</b> of {{the active}} site network causes {{residues}} involved in catalysis (and residues in contact with these) to be highly evolutionarily conserved. However, there are examples of divergent evolution in catalytic triads, both in the reaction catalysed, and the residues used in catalysis. The triad remains the core {{of the active}} site, but it is evolutionarily adapted to serve different functions.|$|E
5|$|This led to {{proposals}} {{for a new}} radar dedicated solely to the early warning role, determining only which MAR or SCD would ultimately {{have to deal with}} the threat. Used primarily in the first minutes of the attack, and not responsible for the engagements, the system could be considered disposable and did not need anything like <b>the</b> <b>sophistication</b> or hardening of the MAR. This led to the Perimeter Acquisition Radar (PAR), which would operate cheaper electronics at VHF frequencies.|$|E

5|$|Further work {{along these}} lines led to the Nike-X Deployment Study, or DEPEX. DEPEX {{outlined}} a deployment that started out very similar to Nth Country, with a few bases primarily using Nike EX to provide lightweight cover, but which also included design features that allowed more bases to be added as {{the nature of the}} threat changed. The study described a four-phase deployment sequence that added more and more terminal defenses as <b>the</b> <b>sophistication</b> of the Nth Country missiles increased over time.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Sexual Preference {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} the historian Paul Robinson in Psychology Today and Richard P. Halgin in Library Journal, a negative review from the sociologist John Gagnon in The New York Times, a notice in Newsweek, and a discussion in The Chronicle of Higher Education, {{which focused on}} the controversy surrounding the book. The following year, it received a negative review from Michael Ignatieff in the London Review of Books. Reviewers faulted the work on grounds such as the questionable representativeness of its sample of homosexuals, though those who reviewed it positively praised it for reasons including <b>the</b> <b>sophistication</b> of its path analysis.|$|E
5|$|Nike-X also {{considered}} a cut down version of MAR known as TACMAR. This {{was essentially a}} MAR {{with half of the}} elements hooked up, reducing its price at the cost of shorter detection range. The processing equipment was likewise reduced in complexity, lacking some of the more sophisticated discrimination processing. TACMAR was designed from the start {{to be able to be}} upgraded to full MAR performance if needed, especially as <b>the</b> <b>sophistication</b> of the threat grew. MAR-II is sometimes described as the prototype TACMAR, but there is considerable confusion on this point in existing sources.|$|E

5|$|A {{thorough}} stylistic {{analysis of}} the ornamentation of the monument, in particular of the figures within the circles of the Battle scene and the Scene of sacrifice reveal a surprising sensitivity to bronze {{on the part of}} Cairano, and considerable scope for reinterpretation and commingling of styles. This stemmed from a sensible response to {{the context in which the}} mausoleum was designed and implemented. Unprecedented in Brescia was the combination of bronze and stone, the former under the supervision of Bernardino delle Croci who certainly had a vast catalogue of references to ancient and contemporary works, all of which are cited in the major and minor rounds on the base. It is difficult to exclude Cairano from the influence of so much classicism, but the sole Scene of sacrifice attests to <b>the</b> <b>sophistication</b> of his chisel and the innovative combination of sculpture and bronzes around 1510, to which date much of the remaining lapidary apparatus can also be placed.|$|E
5|$|The narrator's tone is {{informal}} and conversational, attempting to conjure {{the picture of}} a dialogue between the reader and the speaker (who is evidently Auden himself, speaking directly in the first person as he does in a large proportion of his work). The informality is established syntactically by enjambment—only 13 of the poem's 93 lines are clearly end-stopped. There are few instances of rhyme, and about half the lines end on unaccented syllables. The lines alternate 13 syllables incorporating five or six accents with 11 syllables and four accents. Auden adapted this syllabic construction from Marianne Moore. The pattern is reinforced by the line indentation and confirmed by Auden's own reading. This structure mitigates the tendency of normally accented English speech to fall into the rhythm of iambic pentameter. Swift changes in <b>the</b> <b>sophistication</b> of diction also occur in the poem, as in conversation, and lend it an immediate, informal quality.|$|E
5|$|Artists Mike Marsicano and Kurt Bickenbach played {{critical}} {{roles in}} the creation of the game's aircraft models, which were built in 3D Studio. As reference material, the team photographed real planes at several airfields, and they received blueprints and datasheets from aircraft manufacturers. The game's Grob G103a Twin II sailplane was based directly on the one that Blackley owned at the time. <b>The</b> <b>sophistication</b> of the real-time CFDs complicated the 3D modeling process, as the planes required accurate geometry to fly properly. While attempting to meet this goal, however, Bickenbach said that the models he created were overly detailed, which caused the team to struggle with performance issues related to the high number of polygons. Reducing the number altered the plane's shape, which in turn reduced its flight realism; this necessitated a balance between performance and accuracy. To obtain audio for the planes, Greg LoPiccolo and Tom Streit—former bassist and road manager, respectively, of the band Tribe—visited a Florida importer of Russian aerobatic aircraft. The two placed microphones inside the cockpits and next to the engines, and they flew each plane at multiple speeds while recording with a digital audio tape machine. Combining this material with digital recordings of wind sounds, the team fashioned a physics-based sound system: sounds of the wind and engine are altered in real-time based on wind speed in the game.|$|E
5000|$|Marxist and neo-Marxist historians {{argue that}} rich landowners used their control of state {{processes}} to appropriate public land for their private benefit. This created a landless working class {{that provided the}} labour required in the new industries developing {{in the north of}} England. For example: [...] "In agriculture the years between 1760 and 1820 are the years of wholesale enclosure in which, in village after village, common rights are lost". [...] "Enclosure (when all <b>the</b> <b>sophistications</b> are allowed for) was a plain enough case of class robbery".|$|R
