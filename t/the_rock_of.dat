5|$|In the winter, melting snow seeps into {{cracks and}} joints and freezes at night. The {{force of the}} {{expanding}} ice helps to erode <b>the</b> <b>rock</b> <b>of</b> the Claron Formation. Over 200 of these freeze/thaw cycles occur each year in Bryce Canyon. Frost wedging exploits and widens the nearly vertical joint planes that divide the Pink Member of the Claron Formation.|$|E

5|$|Neanderthals {{are known}} to have lived in caves around <b>the</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>of</b> Gibraltar; in 1848 the first known adult Neanderthal skull, and only the second Neanderthal fossil ever found, was {{excavated}} at Forbes' Quarry on the north face of the Rock. Had the skull been recognised for what it was, the species might have been named Gibraltarians rather than Neanderthals. The date of the skull is unclear but it has been attributed to around the start of the last glacial period about 50,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|Rock {{and metal}} festivals {{have become a}} {{constant}} for the band, that performed both in large open air meetings in Germany (Headbangers Open Air 2006, Bang Your Head!!! 2007, Wacken Open Air 2008 and Wacken Rocks 2009), France (Hellfest Summer Open Air 2009), England (Hard Rock Hell 2007 and 2009, Bloodstock Open Air 2009) and the USA (Power Box Festival 2007) and in smaller settings, like <b>the</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>of</b> Ages Fest in England in 2007 and the Metal Female Voices Fest in Belgium in 2008. Girlschool were opening act for Heaven & Hell in 2007, for Dio in 2008 and for Hawkwind and Motörhead in 2009.|$|E
40|$|First data on major, {{minor and}} trace element (XRF.

Volcanic <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Naboko Vent, at silica content similar to high-Al basalts of Tolbachinsky Dol, have different concentrations of trace elements and some major elements (K 2 O, CaO, TiO 2, P 2 O 5). REE and other incompatible element concentrations in <b>the</b> <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Menyailov Vent are higher than in <b>the</b> <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Naboko Vent at the same element ratios. The differences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volcanic <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two vents of the new eruption may be caused {{by the fact that the}} erupted lavas came from the different levels of the same magma chamber...|$|R

5|$|The Muslim {{presence}} in Gibraltar began on 27 April 711 when the Berber general Tariq ibn-Ziyad led the initial incursion into Iberia {{in advance of}} the main Moorish force under the command of Musa ibn Nusayr, Umayyad governor of Ifriqiya. Gibraltar was named after Tariq, who was traditionally said to have landed on the shores of <b>the</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>of</b> Gibraltar, though it seems more likely that he landed somewhere nearby. Muslim sources claimed that Tariq established some kind of fortification on the Rock, but no evidence has been found and it is not considered credible. It was not until 1160 that a first fortified settlement was built there.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>rock</b> <b>of</b> Siletzia {{has been}} exposed in various places by tectonic uplift (as around the {{periphery}} of the Olympic Mountains), anticlinal folding (such as the Black Hills and Willapa Hills in southwestern Washington), and overthrusting onto other formations (along various faults in central and southern Oregon). These exposures have been variously named the Metchosin Formation of Vancouver Island, the Crescent Formation, Black Hills, and Willapa Hills volcanics of Washington, and the Siletz River Volcanics and Roseburg Formation of Oregon. (See map. The Grays River Volcanics of Washington and Tillamook Volcanics of Oregon are now considered post-Siletz.) Elsewhere Siletzia is covered by younger volcanic and sedimentary deposits.|$|E

5|$|At 19:00, {{delayed by}} {{the effect of}} <b>the</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>of</b> Gibraltar on the wind, the British {{squadron}} rounded Gibraltar and found the French and Spanish ships still assembling at Cabrita Point. The light wind prevented any rapid movement, and Saumarez began to slowly tack towards the combined squadron in line of battle formation. The delay with Moreno's departure had been due {{to the state of}} the captured Hannibal, renamed Annibal, which was unable to make any progress under its jury masts and had been taken under tow by the frigate Indienne. Sighting Saumarez's force, Moreno instructed Indienne and Hannibal to return to Algeciras and at 19:45 issued orders {{for the remainder of the}} squadron to sail eastwards through the Gut of Gibraltar towards Cadiz. He also, following Spanish naval tradition, disembarked his flagship Real Carlos and transferred to the frigate Sabina, persuading Linois to quit Formidable and do the same.|$|E
5|$|The Bourbon Spanish, meanwhile, were {{planning}} {{to carry out a}} surprise attack. Simón Susarte, a Spanish goatherd who had fled Gibraltar after its capture by Rooke a few months earlier, told Villadarias that there was a secret route by which the east side of <b>the</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>of</b> Gibraltar could be scaled. It required a climb of around , of which the upper section was near-vertical, but was passable with the use of rope and ladders via the Great Sand Dune. As the east side was considered virtually impregnable, only the west side was fortified; if the Rock could be climbed from the east, an attacker could evade the fortifications and descend directly into the town. The route was reconnoitred and found to be passable by a lightly armed force.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot at Pinewood Studios at its 007 Stage in the UK, as well as Weissensee in Austria. The pre-title {{sequence}} was filmed on <b>the</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>of</b> Gibraltar and although the sequence shows a hijacked Land Rover careering down various sections of road for several minutes before bursting through a wall towards the sea, the location mostly used the same short stretch of road {{at the very top}} of the Rock, shot from numerous different angles. The beach defences seen at the foot of the Rock in the initial shot were also added solely for the film, to an otherwise non-military area. The action involving the Land Rover switched from Gibraltar to Beachy Head in the UK for the shot showing the vehicle actually getting airborne. Trial runs of the stunt with the Land Rover, during which Bond escapes by parachute from the tumbling vehicle, were filmed in the Mojave Desert, although the final cut of the film uses a shot achieved using a dummy. Other locations included Germany, the United States, and Italy, while the desert scenes were shot in Ouarzazate, Morocco. The conclusion of the film {{was shot at}} the Schönbrunn Palace, Vienna and Elveden Hall, Suffolk.|$|E

25|$|The erosional {{retreat of}} the {{escarpment}} {{from the coast}} to its present position, means that <b>the</b> <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coastal plain are, with very few and small exceptions, older than those that cap {{the top of the}} escarpment. Thus <b>the</b> <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mpumalanga Lowveld below the Mpumalanga portion of the Great Escarpment are more than 3000million years old. <b>The</b> <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> KwaZulu-Natal Midlands belong, in the main, to the Beaufort and Ecca Groups (of the Karoo Supergroup), aged 220–310million years, and are therefore considerably older than the Drakensberg lavas (aged 180million years) which cap the escarpment on the border between KwaZulu-Natal and Lesotho.|$|R
