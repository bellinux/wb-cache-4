After the ceremony day, they would wear the correct gown and hood for their new degree.

She asked her father for permission to turn the vehicle into a true racing-type auto, which Prince Bernhard refused to allow.|$|E

Awesome sent Bigelow into the ringsteps, and Bigelow sent Awesome through a table with a back body drop.

25|$|Menard {{returned}} to the 27 for 2014, with the car running schemes more oriented towards the associate sponsors of MENARDS featured on <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car. Six races prior to the Chase for the Sprint Cup at Indy in July, Menard was involved in an incident with part-time driver Juan Pablo Montoya, sending Menard into the turn 3 wall and relegating him to a 34th-place finish. The incident upset both driver and crew, who felt Montoya had cost them {{a spot in the}} Chase (Menard was dropped to 16th in points). After the fall Richmond race, Menard remained winless and ranked 20th in points, losing out on a spot in the new chase format.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{hood of the}} DeLorean had grooves {{running down}} both sides. It included a gas flap to simplify fuel filling. The gas flap was built so that the trunk could {{be added to the}} total cargo area of the DeLorean. These cars typically had a locking gas cap to prevent siphoning. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cars (although the hood creases stayed). This style was retained well into 1982. Based on production numbers for all three years, this hood style is probably the most common. After the supply of locking gas caps was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no gas flap, but with locking gas caps). The final styling for the hood included the addition of a DeLorean name badge and the removal of the grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood. According to senior personnel who worked at the Dunmurry factory, initial elimination of gas flap hoods has a simple if unglamorous explanation—Chuck Benington, managing director, did not like the gas flap design.|$|E

500|$|Madonna first {{performed}} [...] "Impressive Instant" [...] {{during the}} promotional tours for Music. The first of these, was on November 5, 2000, at Roseland Ballroom in New York City, {{and the other}} on November 29, 2000, at Brixton Academy in London. Accompanying musicians performing with Madonna were; Mirwais Ahmadzaï on guitar and longtime backing singers Niki Haris and Donna DeLory. During the performance of New York, she wore a black tank top with [...] "Britney Spears" [...] written on it, along with cowboy hats and boots. The costumes for the show and the set was designed by Dolce & Gabbana. Roseland's secondary stage was used for the performance and was decked as a neo-Western wonderland, with bales of hay, yellow-lit horseshoes and silver cacti throughout the lobby and entrance. Dancers dressed as cowboys vogued during the pre-show in provocative poses, lassoing each other and skating around the passersby. The stage was draped in an American flag. As the music started, the flag lifted to reveal a white Ford pickup truck from which Madonna emerged, singing [...] "Impressive Instant". Bare-chested male dancers encircled her, as she posed on <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> truck and danced through the song. The vocoder effects on Madonna's voice was removed for the live performance, which Jennifer Vineyard from Rolling Stone felt made the singer's vocals sound [...] "less ridiculous". By the end of the performance, she as transported onto the main stage of Roseland, {{with the help of the}} audience member's hands. A similar performance was done at Brixton Academy; Madonna wore a different T-shirt, with her son Rocco and daughter Lourdes' names printed on it. Around 3,000fans attended the concert in London, which was streamed over the internet. More than nine million people watched the concert according to Nicky Price, a representative for Microsoft's MSN, the webcast's producer. It became the most-viewed webcast of all time, beating Paul McCartney's performance of [...] "50s rock and roll classics" [...] at Liverpool's The Cavern Club in December 1999, which was viewed by an audience of about three million.|$|E

The LD was not awarded after about 1940 and, in 1969, the hood was used for the DipTh, which was awarded until the College ceased clergy training in 1978. A degree with a similar title was introduced in 2007, the Licence in Divinity (Doctoral). This however, is a postdoctoral degree in theology or religious studies, {{the first of its kind}} in the UK.
