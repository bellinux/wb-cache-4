5|$|About 10 to 20 {{white-tailed deer}} {{per square mile}} (2.6 to 5.2 deer per square kilometer) live along {{the river and the}} parkway, more than <b>the</b> <b>ecosystem</b> can carry. They eat low-lying plants, shrubs, and tree saplings, {{reducing}} the food supply for smaller animals. The deer also collide with cars—in Hastings, about 1.6 times per month.|$|E

5000|$|A renewed experience, re-thinking {{the deeper}} meaning of <b>the</b> <b>ecosystems.</b>|$|R
5|$|Ecosystems are {{composed}} {{of a variety of}} abiotic and biotic components that function in an interrelated way. The structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated. Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to <b>the</b> <b>ecosystem.</b> Some of the more important components are: soil, atmosphere, radiation from the sun, water, and living organisms.|$|E
5|$|It is {{suggested}} that by the Early Cambrian, organisms higher in the food chain caused the microbial mats to largely disappear. If these grazers first appeared as the Ediacaran biota started to decline, then it may suggest that they destabilised the microbial substrate, leading to displacement or detachment of the biota; or that {{the destruction of the}} mat destabilised <b>the</b> <b>ecosystem,</b> causing extinctions.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the role of A.viridimontanum in <b>the</b> <b>ecosystem.</b> In general, ferns are less {{susceptible}} to herbivory than flowering plants due to higher levels of toxic and distasteful compounds in their foliage. A.viridimontanum is not known to be threatened by a particular predator or disease.|$|E

5|$|Oil-shale {{extraction}} {{can damage}} the biological and recreational value of land and <b>the</b> <b>ecosystem</b> in the mining area. Combustion and thermal processing generate waste material. In addition, the atmospheric emissions from oil shale processing and combustion include carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. Environmentalists oppose production and usage of oil shale, as it creates even more greenhouse gases than conventional fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|One {{possible}} lingering {{effect of}} the Winfield Scotts wreck was the introduction of black rats to <b>the</b> <b>ecosystem</b> of the Channel Islands. While the wreck is one possible source {{for the arrival of}} rats on Anacapa, another is the later construction of a lighthouse. The first mention of rats on the island is in 1907.|$|E
5|$|The lichen {{typically}} {{grows on}} silicate stone, rarely on decaying wood. It is usually in partial shade in openings in low to mid-elevation moist forests, {{and is also}} frequently found in rocky roadcuts. Lichens with cephalodia are capable of fixing nitrogen, and contribute nitrogen to <b>the</b> <b>ecosystem.</b>|$|E

5|$|As one of {{the major}} herbivores of {{southern}} and eastern Africa, the blue wildebeest {{plays an important role in}} <b>the</b> <b>ecosystem</b> and is a main prey item for large predators such as the lion. It is {{one of the}} animals that draws tourists to the area to observe big game and as such it is of major economic importance to the region. Traditionally blue wildebeest have been hunted for their hides and meat, the skin making good quality leather though the flesh is coarse, dry and rather hard.|$|E
5|$|Bivalve {{molluscs}} {{are used}} as bioindicators to monitor the health of aquatic environments in both fresh water and the marine environments. Their population status or structure, physiology, behaviour or the level of contamination with elements or compounds can indicate the state of contamination status of <b>the</b> <b>ecosystem.</b> They are particularly useful since they are sessile {{so that they are}} representative of the environment where they are sampled or placed. Potamopyrgus antipodarum is used by some water treatment plants to test for estrogen-mimicking pollutants from industrial agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Corals {{that grow}} on reefs are called hermatypic, with those growing {{elsewhere}} {{are known as}} ahermatypic. Most of the latter are azooxanthellate and live in both shallow and deep sea habitats. In the deep sea they share <b>the</b> <b>ecosystem</b> with soft corals, polychaete worms, other worms, crustaceans, molluscs and sponges. In the Atlantic Ocean, the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa forms extensive deep-water reefs which support many other species.|$|E

50|$|Regional {{ecosystems}} are assigned a conservation status {{based on their}} current extent in a particular bioregion. This status affords <b>the</b> regional <b>ecosystem</b> a level of protection from vegetation clearing. Regional {{ecosystems are}} classified as endangered if the area of remnant vegetation for <b>the</b> regional <b>ecosystem</b> is less than 10% of the pre-clearing extent of <b>the</b> regional <b>ecosystem</b> or <b>the</b> area of remnant vegetation for <b>the</b> regional <b>ecosystem</b> is 10% to 30% of the pre-clearing extent of <b>the</b> regional <b>ecosystem</b> and less than 10,000 hectares.|$|R

5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman is {{considered}} to be a keystone species whose presence in <b>the</b> <b>ecosystem</b> maintains a healthy balance of organisms. In its absence, fish, such as piranhas, might dominate the environment. The eggs and newly hatched young of Cuvier's dwarf caiman are most at risk and are preyed on by birds, snakes, rats, raccoons and other mammals. Adult caimans are protected by the bony osteoderms under the scales and their main predators are jaguars, green anacondas (Eunectes murinus) and large boa constrictors (Boa constrictor).|$|E
5|$|Forest {{fires were}} viewed {{for many decades}} {{as a threat to}} {{protected}} areas such as forests and parks. As a better understanding of fire ecology developed after the 1960s, forest fires were understood to be a natural part of <b>the</b> <b>ecosystem.</b> The earlier policies of suppression resulted in the accumulation of dead and decaying trees and plants, which would normally have been reduced had fires been allowed to burn. Many species of plants and animals actually need wildfires to help replenish the soil with nutrients and to open up areas that allow grasses and smaller plants to thrive.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park is {{an almost}} {{pristine}} ecosystem and the same species of flora and fauna that have existed since prehistoric times can still be found there. More than 1,000species of vascular plants, dozens of species of mammals, 300 species of birds, {{more than a dozen}} fish species and a few species of reptiles and amphibians exist. Due to various changes in <b>the</b> <b>ecosystem,</b> some of them human-induced, efforts have been made to provide enhanced protection to some species of native fish and the increasingly threatened whitebark pine.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, in {{response}} to renewed plans for dam construction in Kaeng Sua Ten, Living River Siam released {{a report on the}} people of Sa-iap, Amphoe Song, Phrae Province (part of Mae Yom National Park), based on their own experiences and history. It was called Chaobaan research, but the methodology was equivalent to the Thai Baan research. The report examined <b>the</b> <b>ecosystem</b> of the residents of Sa-iap, the vegetables and fungi they subsisted on, medicinal herbs they used, local fauna, wood resources, and their culture.|$|E
5|$|In captivity, only Campbell's dwarf hamsters and Djungarian hamsters {{are able}} to interbreed and produce live {{offspring}} or hybrids. Although hybrids make suitable pets, the breeding of hybrids and cloning can cause health problems, due to inherited diseases. Because genetic information can be very similar, genetic health problems or vulnerabilities can easily be inherited by the offspring. The widespread breeding and distribution of hybrids could threaten the existence of both pure species and subspecies of <b>the</b> <b>ecosystem.</b> This could ultimately lead to the extinction of the subspecies. Each litter becomes smaller as more generations are produced and the young commonly begin to inherit many congenital problems.|$|E
5|$|Justin Ferrell explores three moral {{sensibilities}} {{that motivated}} activists {{in dealing with}} Yellowstone. First came the utilitarian vision of maximum exploitation of natural resources, characteristic of developers in the late 19th century. Second was the spiritual vision of nature inspired by the Romanticism and the transcendentalists the mid-19th century. The twentieth century saw the biocentric moral vision {{that focuses on the}} health of <b>the</b> <b>ecosystem</b> as theorized by Aldo Leopold, which led to the expansion of federally protected areas and to the surrounding ecosystems.|$|E

30|$|Advocates of {{ecosystem}} solutions often omit the unaccounted “costs” {{of relying on}} <b>ecosystems</b> in <b>the</b> form of taking up land or constrains on <b>the</b> <b>ecosystems</b> capacity to deliver their services without significant degradation. Furthermore, healthy ecosystems have to sustain first and foremost their own metabolism, before providing services to human societies. From preservation of the biotic environment point of view, one could also ask if {{it is better to}} degrade <b>the</b> <b>ecosystems</b> that is inevitable when ecosystem resources are appropriated or if one should accept the “concentrated damage” that engineering solutions may impose on the environment in return for potentially leaving larger portions of <b>the</b> <b>ecosystems</b> alone with less or even without human disturbance.|$|R
