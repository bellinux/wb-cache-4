Further physical changes were bred into the cocker in the United States during <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Originally called Holford's Prairie, Lewisville {{dates back}} to the early 1840s.

Lewisville incorporated in 1925, and when construction of Lewisville Lake was completed in the 1950s, the city began to expand rapidly.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the game, Maryland {{head coach}} Ralph Friedgen placed a partial-game {{suspension}} on seven players who violated the team's pre-bowl curfew, including leading rusher, Da'Rel Scott, and senior wide receiver Danny Oquendo.
