5|$|When a Liu-family {{relative}} of an emperor—usually a princely son—was designated as his heir apparent, he was provided living quarters within the palace {{and a personal}} staff which was not disbanded until he became the next emperor. During Western Han, the staff had two divisions: one was led by educators of <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> apparent, known as the Grand Tutor of <b>the</b> <b>Heir</b> Apparent (ranked 2000–dan) and Junior Tutor of <b>the</b> <b>Heir</b> Apparent (ranked 2000–dan), the other led by a Supervisor of the Household (ranked 2,000-dan). During Eastern Han, the Grand Tutor of <b>the</b> <b>Heir</b> Apparent lost his administrative role but remained the chief educator and was promoted in rank to Fully 2,000-dan; the Junior Tutor remained an administrator with a salary-rank of 2,000-dan. The post of Supervisor of the Household was abolished. Other Western Han staff offices of <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> apparent were abolished during Eastern Han, such as the Chief of the Kitchen and the Household Prison of <b>the</b> <b>Heir</b> Apparent. If he reached adulthood, <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> apparent could be married to a principal wife who led a harem of his concubines.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Frederick, <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> to the British throne on 20 March 1751, caused {{constitutional}} chaos; George II wished to appoint his favourite son Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, as Regent (since <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> apparent, George III, {{was only a}} child), while the public favoured the child's mother Princess Augusta. In an attempt to reach a compromise the government introduced a bill to Parliament declaring that Augusta {{was to be a}} regent along with a council of others, and that George would become <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> when he reached maturity. Murray made a speech supporting the government's proposal, but despite this, Parliament was not convinced that a council was necessary.|$|E
5|$|Before Tiberius, {{the heirs}} of Augustus were {{the sons of}} Marcus Agrippa, Gaius and Lucius Caesar, whom he adopted and made heir. They {{advanced}} through their careers at the same pace {{and were going to}} rule together; however, they died young, forcing Augustus to draw another line of succession. In AD 4, Augustus adopted Tiberius on condition that Tiberius adopt Germanicus. This made Tiberius <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> of Augustus, and Germanicus <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> of Tiberius. Like the sons of Agrippa, it was the intention of Augustus that Germanicus and Drusus would rule together.|$|E
5000|$|With the cession of California to the United States {{following}} the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo {{provided that the}} land grants would be honored.

Williams (Maria Louisa Carson, widow and John Shelby Williams, Jr., son), and <b>the</b> <b>heirs</b> of John Potter, filed a claim for Rancho Farwell with the Public Land Commission in 1853.

5|$|On 30 December 1777, Maximilian Joseph, {{the last}} of the junior line of Wittelsbach, died of smallpox, leaving no children. Charles IV Theodore, a scion of a senior branch of the House of Wittelsbach, held the closest claim of kinship, but he also had no {{legitimate}} children to succeed him. His cousin, Charles II August, Duke of Zweibrücken, therefore had a legitimate legal claim as Charles Theodore's heir presumptive. Across Bavaria's southern border, Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II coveted the Bavarian territory and had married Maximilian Joseph's sister Maria Josepha in 1765 to strengthen any claim he could extend. His agreement with <b>the</b> <b>heir,</b> Charles Theodore, to partition the territory neglected any claims of <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> presumptive, Charles August.|$|E

50|$|Earl Temple of Stowe, in the County of Buckingham, is a {{title in}} the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1822 for Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 2nd Marquess of Buckingham, who was created Marquess of Chandos and Duke of Buckingham and Chandos at the same time. In {{contrast}} to the Marquessate and Dukedom, which were created with remainder to <b>the</b> <b>heirs</b> male of his body only, the Earldom was created with remainder to (1) <b>the</b> <b>heirs</b> male of his body, failing which to (2) <b>the</b> <b>heirs</b> male of his deceased great-grandmother the 1st Countess Temple, failing which to (3) his granddaughter Lady Anna Grenville (daughter of Richard, Earl Temple, later 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos) and <b>the</b> <b>heirs</b> male of her body, and then to possible younger daughters of Lord Temple and <b>the</b> <b>heirs</b> male of their bodies (there were, in the event, no other daughters).|$|R

5|$|When sons of an epikleros came of age, {{they gained}} the {{ownership}} of the inheritance. In Athens, this age was given in an extant law, and was two years {{past the age of}} puberty of the son. In Solon's laws, it appears that the eldest son of the epikleros was considered <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> of his maternal grandfather, with any further sons being considered part of their father's household. The son's inheritance of his maternal grandfather's property happened whether or not his father and mother were alive, unlike most other inheritances. And the son of an epikleros did not inherit anything from his father, and was named after his grandfather. <b>The</b> <b>heir</b> could further consolidate his position by being posthumously adopted by his maternal grandfather, but this was not required. By the 4th century BCE, legal practices had changed, and the son could also inherit from his father, as well as from his maternal grandfather. And if there was more than one son, they divided the estate passed by the epikleros between themselves. After <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> secured possession of his inheritance, the law specified that he was to support his mother. It is likely that the debts of the grandfather were also inherited along with any property.|$|E
5|$|Ashley-Cooper was the {{grandson}} of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 9th Earl of Shaftesbury. Ashley-Cooper's father was <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> apparent to the earldom and its subsidiary titles, but he predeceased his father. His death made his son next {{in the line of}} succession. When his grandfather died in 1961, Ashley-Cooper became the 10th Earl of Shaftesbury, Baron Ashley of Wimborne St Giles and Baron Cooper of Pawlett.|$|E

50|$|The family thus became {{split between}} <b>the</b> <b>heirs</b> male and <b>the</b> <b>heirs</b> of line, <b>the</b> title devolving upon the Broun of Thornydyke family in Berwickshire, and the estates upon the heiress who married George Broun of Eastfield, again uniting older strands {{of the same}} family.|$|R
5|$|Before his succession, George {{was granted}} the royal arms differenced by a label of five points Azure, the centre point bearing a fleur-de-lis Or on 27 July 1749. Upon his father's death, {{and along with}} the dukedom of Edinburgh and the {{position}} of heir-apparent, he inherited his difference of a plain label of three points Argent.
