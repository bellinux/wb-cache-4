5|$|Twilight sadly {{returns to}} the library, {{preparing}} to pack and leave Ponyville, when she finds Spike coughing up scroll after scroll. Twilight is surprised to find these to be the friendship report letters that she had previously sent to Celestia, and the memories of her friendships in Ponyville make her regain her color. Inspired by this, she returns to her other four best friends and uses a memory spell <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>them</b> of their friendship, cancelling Discord's magic and returning them to normal.|$|E
5|$|The polyptych was {{commissioned}} to provide both comfort and {{warning to the}} dying. It was intended <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>them</b> of their faith, and direct their last thoughts towards the divine. This is evident in its positioning in the chapel, within view of the patients' beds. Rolin specified that 30 beds be placed {{within sight of the}} altarpiece for those too ill to walk, where it was visible to them through a pierced screen. There were usually only two patients per bed, luxurious at a time when six to fifteen in a large bed was more common. Medical care was expensive and primitive in the 15th century; the spiritual care of patients was as important as the treatment of physical ailments.|$|E
5|$|Rowell was {{promoted}} to colonel on 13 October 1939, and when the government decided to form I Corps in April 1940, Blamey was given the command and Rowell became brigadier, general staff (BGS), with the rank of brigadier. Blamey and Rowell prepared I Corps for operations as best they could, completing the force's structure and integrating new units as they arrived in the Middle East. Rowell strove to establish {{good relations with the}} British Army, while occasionally having <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>them</b> that the AIF was answerable to its own commander in chief and its own government. Rowell's efforts to create an administrative headquarters to free the I Corps staff for operational duties foundered on Blamey's reluctance to delegate authority. The best that he could achieve was the creation of a Base and Line of Communications Units command under Brigadier Allan Boase but I Corps remained responsible for organisation and training.|$|E

5|$|Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) is outed at {{his school}} and {{subsequently}} bullied by his teammates {{in the locker}} room. He is also mercilessly attacked online. Karofsky, devastated, attempts suicide by hanging, but is saved in time by his father. The news causes shock at his old school, McKinley High: Members of the staff believe {{they could have done}} more to help him when he had been a student there, while Kurt blames himself for ignoring Karofsky's repeated phone calls that week. It also shocks Sebastian, who had cruelly rebuffed Karofsky at a gay bar, and he destroys the photos of Finn, thus abandoning his attempt at blackmail. New Directions coach Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) has all of the members reveal something they are looking forward to in the future, <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>them</b> that no matter how low they think their lives have sunk, they should not forget what is ahead of them. Rachel and Finn apologize to each other, and decide to get married the day after Regionals.|$|E

25|$|In Buddhist practice, humility {{is practiced}} {{in a variety}} of ways. For example, Japanese Soto Zen monks bow and chant in honor of their robes before they don them. This serves <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>them</b> of the {{connection}} of the monk's robes with enlightenment. Buddhist monks in all traditions are dependent on the generosity of laypeople, through whom they receive their necessities. This in itself is a practice of humility.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, {{the number}} of {{proficient}} speakers of Occitan is dropping precipitously. A tourist in the cities in southern France is unlikely to hear a single Occitan word spoken on the street (or, for that matter, in a home), {{and is likely to}} only find the occasional vestige, such as street signs (and, of those, most will have French equivalents more prominently displayed), <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>them</b> of the traditional language of the area.|$|E

25|$|The lynchers {{sometimes}} murdered their victims, {{but sometimes}} whipped them <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>them</b> {{of their former}} status as slaves. White terrorists often made night-time raids of African-American homes in order to confiscate firearms. Lynchings to prevent freedmen and their allies from voting and bearing arms were extralegal ways of trying to enforce the previous system of social dominance and the Black Codes, which had been invalidated by the 14th and 15th Amendments in 1868 and 1870.|$|E
25|$|Groups {{such as the}} Tolpuddle Martyrs {{would often}} use a {{skeleton}} painting {{as part of their}} initiation process. The newest member would be blindfolded and made to swear a secret oath of allegiance. The blindfold would then be removed and they would be presented with the skeleton painting. This was to warn them of their own mortality but also <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>them</b> of what happens to those who break their promises. An example of this skeleton painting is on display at the People's History Museum, Manchester.|$|E
25|$|There {{was more}} {{discussion}} about the Army’s stance over Home Rule outside the Army than within it. Seely spoke to the assembled Commanders-in-Chief of the Army's six Regional Commands, <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>them</b> of their responsibility to uphold the civil power. They met at the War Office on 16 December 1913 with French and the Adjutant-General Spencer Ewart present. He assured them that the Army would not be called upon for “some outrageous action, for instance, to massacre a demonstration of Orangemen”, but nonetheless officers could not “pick and choose” which lawful orders they would obey, and that any officer who attempted to resign on the issue should instead be dismissed. This did not stop tensions about the Army's role from growing.|$|E

5000|$|In {{connection}} with the Union, William Pitt intended {{to bring in a}} Catholic Relief Bill. He commissioned Lord Castlereagh to make such arrangements as would satisfy the king George III of Great Britain that no priest whose loyalty the king should have reason to suspect would be appointed to an Irish bishopric. Ten bishops, trustees of Maynooth College, met on 17 January 1799, to transact college business. Castlereagh submitted his views <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>reminding</b> <b>them</b> of the suspicion of disloyalty under which the Catholics of Ireland lay since the insurrection of the year before. The ten bishops embodied their reply in certain resolutions, of which this was one: ...|$|R

25|$|The {{plan was}} {{formulated}} and preparations were completed by January 642. The success of plan depended upon how effectively Umar {{would be able}} to coordinate these attacks from Madinah, about 1500 kilometers from the battlefields in Persia and upon the skills and abilities of his field commanders. Umar appointed his best field commanders to conquer the Sassanid Empire and bring down his most formidable foe, Yazdegerd III. The campaign saw a different pattern in command structure. Instead of appointing a single field commander to campaign across the Persian lands, Umar appointed several commanders, each assigned a different mission. Once the mission would end the commander would become an ordinary soldier under the command of the new field commander for the latter's mission. The purpose of this strategy was to allow commanders to mix in with their soldiers and <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>them</b> that they are like everyone else; command is only given to those most competent, and once the battle is over, the commander returns to his previous position.|$|E
25|$|Owain {{also scored}} {{his first major}} victory {{in the field in}} May or June, at Mynydd Hyddgen near Pumlumon. Owain and his army of a few hundred were camped {{at the bottom of the}} Hyddgen Valley when about fifteen hundred English and Flemish {{settlers}} from Pembrokeshire ('little England beyond Wales'), charged down on them. Owain rallied his army and fought back, killing 200. The situation was sufficiently serious for the King to assemble another punitive expedition. This time he attacked in October through central Wales. From Shrewsbury and Hereford Castle, Henry IV's forces drove through Powys toward the Strata Florida Abbey. The Cistercian house was known to be sympathetic towards Owain and Henry intended <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>them</b> of their loyalties and prevent the revolt from spreading any further south. After much harassment by Owain's forces he reached Strata Florida. Henry was in no mood to be merciful. His army partially destroyed the abbey and executed a monk suspected of bearing arms against him. However, he failed to engage Owain's forces in any large numbers. Owain's forces harassed him and engaged in hit-and-run tactics on his supply chain but refused to fight in the open. Henry's army was forced to retreat. They arrived at Worcester on 28 October 1401 with little to claim for their efforts. The year came to end with the Battle of Tuthill, an inconclusive battle fought during Owain's siege of Caernarfon Castle on 2 November 1401.|$|E

500|$|Evaluating the developments, {{political}} observers in Mumbai remarked that the Shiv Sena had been [...] "caught in a bind" [...] by Raj's campaign {{as it had}} in recent years sought to portray an inclusive image to try to woo the significant migrant vote in the Mumbai and Thane region {{in the run-up to the}} Assembly elections in 2009.

500|$|Christiane Schönfeld writes that, [...] "(t)he Jew {{as sexual}} beast and vampire, sucking the life spirit from {{individual}} and community alike is an {{all too common}} motif in anti-Semitic propaganda and is put to effective use in Harlan's film." [...] Michael Töteberg writes: [...] "(Jud Süß) openly mobilized fears and sexual aggression and exploited them for anti-Semitic incitement." [...] According to Michael Kater, the film was shown to [...] "a large number of (German) girls" [...] in order to warn them of the [...] "sexual devastation that Jews had wrought in the past" [...] and <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>them</b> of the Nuremberg Race Laws of 1935. In an interview with Der Film given before {{the release of the}} film, Harlan pointed out that Süß was ultimately sentenced to death not for his financial machinations which were technically legal but for violating an ancient law which prohibited Jews from having sexual relations with Christian women. He then cites this as being [...] "an interesting parallel to the Nuremberg Laws.|$|E
5000|$|The reward {{theory of}} {{attraction}} states {{that people like}} those whose behavior is rewarding to them or whom they associate with rewarding events.
