5|$|In 2012, a study {{examining}} truthiness {{was carried}} out by PhD student Eryn Newman of Victoria University of Wellington. The experiments showed that people are more likely <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> claim is true regardless of evidence when a decorative photograph appears alongside it.|$|E
5|$|Campy performances, cheesy special effects, and downright awful {{dialogue}} all {{contribute to}} making Jaws 3 a truly dismal experience for just about everyone. It's not only hard <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> sequel this downright abominable didn't kill the franchise, but that it actually would {{be followed by a}} movie that was arguably worse—Jaws: the Revenge.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. When Mulder and Scully are called to New York to {{investigate}} {{the death of a}} police officer, they come <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> young girl present at the incident may be the reincarnation of another officer murdered years earlier.|$|E
5000|$|Later in episode 15, [...] "The Man from Nowhere", Jeannie goes {{as far as}} partly <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> imposter is {{actually}} her deceased husband Marty in spirit, again emphasising her vulnerability.|$|R

50|$|L'Houssaine Kherchtou later {{testified in}} the United States {{that he had}} seen an Egyptian {{briefing}} Nawawi on air traffic control procedures, leading him <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> attack on an airplane, possibly in Saudi Arabia, was in the works.|$|R
5|$|There {{is every}} reason <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> very close {{formation}} of six Wellington aircraft will emerge from a long and heavy attack by enemy fighters with very few if any casualties to its own aircraft. A loose formation is however liable to suffer very heavy casualties under the same conditions.|$|E
5|$|Crane starts <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> {{conspiracy}} links all {{the deaths}} together, so he looks into Van Garrett's last will. Van Garrett {{had made a}} new will just before he died, leaving all his possessions to his secret new bride, Emily Winship, whom Crane discovers was pregnant with Van Garrett's child. Crane deduces that all who knew about the new will, the marriage and the pregnancy were {{the victims of the}} Horseman and that Katrina's father Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon), who would have inherited the fortune, is the person holding the skull. Katrina, finding out that Crane suspects her father, burns all the evidence that Crane has accumulated.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the main}} reasons that girls are less likely to reach optimal levels of {{education}} include the fact that girls are needed to assist their mothers at home, have been raised <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> life of domestic work is their destined occupation, have illiterate mothers who cannot educate their children, have an economic dependency on men, and are sometimes subject to child-marriage. Many poor families marry their daughters off early to get the dowry money so she is unable to complete her education.|$|E
50|$|There is {{no reason}} <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> {{anonymous}} production of Armida staged in Lucca in 1778 made use of any of Mysliveček's music, in spite of multiple claims in the musicological literature that it constituted the original version of the Milan opera of 1780.|$|R
50|$|A {{suspicion}} indicator is {{an indication}} based on known (or predicted) terrorist or criminal methods of operation or deviation from <b>a</b> typical profile <b>that</b> may lead one <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> observed situation (persons and/or objects) may {{have the potential for}} harming the protected environment and its inhabitants.|$|R
5000|$|GCHQ and NSA {{declined}} to comment on the matter. Gemalto issued a press release on February 25, 2015 saying there were [...] "reasonable grounds <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> operation by NSA and GCHQ probably happened," [...] but denying that the government agencies gained access to any authentication keys.|$|R
5|$|The {{first two}} attacks had been {{successful}} and as Allied commanders began <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> breakthrough was possible further attacks {{were made at}} Poelcappelle on 9 October and at Passchendaele on 12 October despite heavy rain that turned the ground into a muddy quagmire. Both attacks were ultimately doomed to failure, with heavy casualties, as the attacks foundered {{in the mud and}} as the battle petered out, it was decided {{that it was time for}} the Australians to be withdrawn from the line. This was completed by 14 November 1917. Over the course of the eight weeks they had been involved in the fighting around Ypres, they had suffered 38,000 casualties.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the {{expedition}} had arisen after items from the American vessel Jeannette, which had sunk off the north coast of Siberia in 1881, were discovered three years later off the south-west coast of Greenland. The wreckage had obviously been carried across the polar ocean, perhaps across the pole itself. Based on this and other debris recovered from the Greenland coast, the meteorologist Henrik Mohn developed a theory of transpolar drift, which led Nansen <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> specially designed ship could be frozen in the pack ice and follow the same track as the Jeannette wreckage, thus reaching {{the vicinity of the}} pole.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{documentary}} {{account of}} Gibraltar {{is available for}} the period following the Madinat al-Fath project, there are reasons <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> small fortified town existed in Gibraltar, and that its existence was the direct consequence {{of the fall of}} Tarifa in 1292. After the capture of the city, it was expected that Sancho would lay siege to Algeciras (it did not eventually happen) in order to sever the most direct links of the Marinids with the Iberian peninsula. The threatening presence of a Christian stronghold to the west would have led to the establishment of a garrison to the east of Algeciras. That way, Gibraltar would have protected the rearguard of Algeciras and provide a fallback position should Algeciras have fallen. At the same time, and with the increased presence of the Christian fleets in the Straits, Gibraltar provided an excellent lookout post.|$|E
5000|$|On April 24, 2014, Commissioner of Canada Elections Yves Cote {{announced}} that his investigation had determined {{that there was}} insufficient evidence <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> offence was committed. The Elections Canada investigation has been criticized by lawyer Steven Shrybman as [...] "fatally flawed". Similar criticisms {{have been made by}} others as well.|$|R
50|$|The Church of St John the Baptist in Aldenham {{village is}} seven {{hundred years old}} and {{there is good reason}} <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> earlier Saxon church stood on the site.After the Reformation the lands were sold off to the highest bidders and Aldenham is {{probably}} smaller today than it was 500 years ago.|$|R
50|$|On June 7, 2010, while {{showcasing}} the new iPhone 4, Apple {{posted a}} few screenshots {{of the device}} in action and inadvertently showed the possibility of opening an email attachment inside of Keynote, leading some <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> iPhone version of the iWork suite would soon {{be available in the}} iOS App Store.|$|R
5|$|Lois {{hears about}} Brian on TV, and then discovers {{that her parents}} do not love each other, and even raised her <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> {{heterosexual}} couple who hate each other {{have every right to}} marry while a homosexual couple who love each other don't. Horrified, Lois changes her mind on same-sex marriage, deciding that gay couples who love each other {{have the right to be}} together. She returns to Quahog to convince Brian to free the mayor, saying that if he pursues this any further, he will be hurting his own cause. Brian agrees, and ends the hostage situation. Since it has distracted the town from the Dig 'Em scandal, Mayor West agrees to drop the ban on gay marriage. Brian gives him a key for a Volkswagen Scirocco, and West drops the hostage charges. Jasper and Ricardo get married in the backyard of the Griffin house.|$|E
5|$|The WIYN Observatory's 3.5m {{telescope}} {{was used for}} speckle imaging on June 18, 2010; in addition, the PHARO camera on the Palomar Observatory's 5m {{telescope was}} used for its adaptive optics capabilities. These observations, combined with observations of Kepler-10's spectrum taken from the W.M. Keck Observatory, ruled {{out the possibility that}} a nearby star's light was corrupting the observed spectrum of Kepler-10 and creating the results that had led astronomers <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> second planet existed in Kepler-10's orbit. All of these possibilities, with the exception of if such a star existed exactly behind or in front of Kepler-10, were effectively ruled out; even with this, the Kepler team found that if a star was indeed aligned with Kepler-10 as seen from Earth, such a star would probably not be a giant star.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} other points which cast serious doubt on Leod's {{traditional}} ancestry. In 1265, Magnus, King of Mann, the last king of this Manx dynasty died. Later in 1275, Magnus's illegitimate son, Godfrey died while leading a revolt. At least two women later {{came forward with}} claims for the kingdom—yet Leod and his sons did not. According to W.D.H. Sellar, it is hard <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> descendant of the royal line would not have put forward a claim. Another point put forward is that the MacLeods did not adopt the royal names of the 13th century Manx dynasty—names such as Godfrey (Old Norse: Guðrøðr; Gaelic: Gofraid), Ranald (Old Norse Rögnvaldr; Gaelic: Raghnall), Olaf (Old Norse Óláfr; Gaelic Amlaíb), and Harald (Old Norse Haraldr; Gaelic Aralt). Sellar illustrated his point by noting the royal names adopted by the descendants of Somerled (d.1164) and his wife Ragnhild, daughter of Olaf the Red (grandfather of Olaf the Black).|$|E
25|$|A lie which {{attempts}} to trick the victim into believing something major which {{will likely be}} contradicted by some information the victim already possesses, or by their common sense. When the lie is of sufficient magnitude it may succeed, due to the victim's reluctance <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> untruth on such a grand scale would indeed be concocted.|$|R
50|$|The {{knowledge}} {{requirement for}} contributory infringement is an objective assessment and stands fulfilled if the defendant has actual or constructive knowledge of an infringement, i.e., {{if he or}} she has reason <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> infringement is taking place. But, constructive knowledge need not be imputed to the defendant if the product was capable of significant noninfringing uses.|$|R

25|$|The atheistic {{conclusion}} is that the arguments and evidence both indicate there is insufficient {{reason to believe that}} any gods exist, and that personal subjective religious experiences say something about the human experience rather than the nature of reality itself; therefore, one has no reason <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> god exists.|$|E
50|$|Most {{recently}} {{the number of}} songs approved for airplay on Triple J has been decreased dramatically, leading some <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> over-emphasis on certain styles of music, particularly electro and dance, has had {{a negative effect on}} the formerly unbiased genre programming. It is also said that this has affected the cultivation of musical diversity on the Unearthed program.|$|R

She maintains it is <b>a</b> crass stereotype <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> entire nation has a uniform taste with respect to wine. She argued instead that US wine drinkers have shown a growing appetite for more balanced and drinkable wines.|$|R
