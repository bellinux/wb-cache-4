5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the Court's decision in Schmerber, many legal scholars feared the ruling {{would be used to}} limit civil liberties. Other scholars, including Nita A. Farahany, Benjamin Holley, and John G. New, have suggested courts may use the ruling in Schmerber to justify the use of mind reading devices against criminal suspects. Because the Court's ruling in Schmerber prohibited the use of warrantless blood tests in most circumstances, some commentators argue that the decision was responsible for the proliferation of breathalyzers <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> alcohol and urine analyses <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> controlled substances in criminal investigations.|$|E
5|$|Their {{sensitivity}} to water quality also makes them suitable for bioassays. Americamysis bahia and Americamysis almyra are frequently used <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> pesticides and other toxic substances, with A. bahia {{found to be}} more sensitive during the periods when it is moulting.|$|E
5|$|Bivalve {{molluscs}} {{are used}} as bioindicators to monitor the health of aquatic environments in both fresh water and the marine environments. Their population status or structure, physiology, behaviour or the level of contamination with elements or compounds can indicate the state of contamination status of the ecosystem. They are particularly useful since they are sessile {{so that they are}} representative of the environment where they are sampled or placed. Potamopyrgus antipodarum is used by some water treatment plants <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> estrogen-mimicking pollutants from industrial agriculture.|$|E

5|$|Damage to nerves III, IV, or VI {{may affect}} the {{movement}} of the eyeball (globe). Both or one eye may be affected; in either case double vision (diplopia) will likely occur because the movements of the eyes are no longer synchronized. Nerves III, IV and VI are tested by observing how the eye follows an object in different directions. This object may be a finger or a pin, and may be moved at different directions <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> pursuit velocity. If the eyes do not work together, the most likely cause is damage to a specific cranial nerve or its nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Evaluating {{pesticide}} {{contributions to}} CCD is particularly difficult for several reasons. First, {{the variety of}} pesticides in use in the different areas reporting CCD makes it difficult <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> all possible pesticides simultaneously. Second, many commercial beekeeping operations are mobile, transporting hives over large geographic distances {{over the course of}} a season, potentially exposing the colonies to different pesticides at each location. Third, the bees themselves place pollen and honey into long-term storage, effectively meaning a delay may occur from days to months before contaminated provisions are fed to the colony, negating any attempts to associate the appearance of symptoms with the actual time when exposure to pesticides occurred.|$|E
5|$|Genital herpes {{can be more}} {{difficult}} to diagnose than oral herpes, since most HSV-2-infected persons have no classical symptoms. Further confusing diagnosis, several other conditions resemble genital herpes, including fungal infection, lichen planus, atopic dermatitis, and urethritis. Laboratory testing is often used to confirm a diagnosis of genital herpes. Laboratory tests include culture of the virus, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) studies to detect virus, skin biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> presence of viral DNA. Although these procedures produce highly sensitive and specific diagnoses, their high costs and time constraints discourage their regular use in clinical practice.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to explore and describe the factors that influence the decision by pregnant women <b>to</b> be <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> HIV. This was achieved through a qualitative research study that was exploratory, descriptive and contextual in nature. A sample of 13 pregnant women participated. Data obtained from semi-structured interviews was analysed according to a protocol based on a combination of methods of analysis. The three main themes, namely factors that contribute to the decision by pregnant women <b>to</b> be <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> HIV, factors that contribute to the decision by pregnant women not <b>to</b> be <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> HIV and organisational factors that influence the decision by pregnant women <b>to</b> be <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> HIV, were divided into nine subthemes. Conclusions and recommendations to promote counselling to pregnant women being <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> HIV are provided. [URL]...|$|R

By the end of November, Joel Edgerton, Jack Huston, Jim Sturgess, and Eddie Redmayne signed deals <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> the role of Peter Quill, as did Lee Pace, which he confirmed a week later in early December. Other actors who were considered for the role included s Zachary Levi, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Michael Rosenbaum, and John Gallagher Jr. Chris Pratt was cast in the role in February 2013, {{as part of a}} multi-film deal that he signed with Marvel.|$|E
5|$|Polyols, {{compounds}} containing {{more than}} one alcohol functional group, generally interact with cupric salts. For example, copper salts are used <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> reducing sugars. Specifically, using Benedict's reagent and Fehling's solution {{the presence of the}} sugar is signaled by a color change from blue Cu(II) to reddish copper(I) oxide. Schweizer's reagent and related complexes with ethylenediamine and other amines dissolve cellulose. Amino acids form very stable chelate complexes with copper(II). Many wet-chemical tests for copper ions exist, one involving potassium ferrocyanide, which gives a brown precipitate with copper(II) salts.|$|E
5|$|Potassium tetraiodomercurate(II), K2HgI4, is {{also known}} as Nessler's reagent. It is often used as a {{sensitive}} spot test for ammonia. Similarly, Cu2HgI4 is used as a precipitating reagent <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> alkaloids. The iodide and iodate anions are often used for quantitative volumetric analysis, for example in iodometry and the iodine clock reaction (in which iodine also serves as a test for starch, forming a dark blue complex), and aqueous alkaline iodine solution is used in the iodoform test for methyl ketones. The iodine test for starch is still used to detect counterfeit banknotes printed on starch-containing paper.|$|E
40|$|A general goodness-of-fit <b>test</b> <b>for</b> scale-parameter {{families}} of distributions is introduced, {{which is based}} on quotients of expected sample minima. The test is independent of the mean of the distribution, and, in applications <b>to</b> <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> exponentiality of data, compares favorably <b>to</b> other goodness-of-fit <b>tests</b> <b>for</b> exponentiality based on the empirical distribution function, regression methods and correlation statistics. The new minimal-moment method uses ratios of easily-calculated, unbiased, strongly consistent U-statistics, and the general technique can be used <b>to</b> <b>test</b> many standard composite null hypotheses such as exponentiality, normality or uniformity (as well as simple null hypotheses) ...|$|R

5|$|The mid-18th century saw an {{upsurge in}} the public's {{fear of being}} mistakenly buried alive, and much debate about the {{uncertainty}} of the signs of death. Various suggestions were made <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> signs of life before burial, ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse's mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet, or even into the rectum. Writing in 1895, the physician J. C. Ouseley claimed that as many as 2,700 people were buried prematurely each year in England and Wales, although others estimated the figure to be closer to 800.|$|E
5|$|The {{safety culture}} at WCRC {{was found by}} the {{investigation}} to be weak. This was evidenced {{by a number of}} factors, including the lack of traction inspectors, failure <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> drugs and alcohol, failure to download data from OTDRs to analyse individual driver performance, failure to maintain OTDR equipment correctly, failure to report missing seals on safety equipment where they were required to be fitted. Failure to keep proper records. Failure to improve following the incident at Bell Busk (detailed below).|$|E
5|$|When the {{adaptive}} immune system of a vertebrate encounters a virus, it produces specific antibodies that bind to the virus and often render it non-infectious. This is called humoral immunity. Two types of antibodies are important. The first, called IgM, is highly effective at neutralising viruses but is produced by {{the cells of the}} immune system only for a few weeks. The second, called IgG, is produced indefinitely. The presence of IgM in the blood of the host is used <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> acute infection, whereas IgG indicates an infection sometime in the past. IgG antibody is measured when tests for immunity are carried out.|$|E

30|$|In this chapter, we {{introduce}} the three criteria, i.e. persistence (P), bioaccumulation (B) and toxicity (T). The general scheme is <b>to</b> <b>test</b> sequentially <b>for</b> P, then B and lastly for T, as only substances with high persistence {{must be considered}} further for PBT identification. This sequence is further justified by the need <b>to</b> limit <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> animal welfare reasons.|$|R

5|$|Broccoli and Saltzman {{tried to}} {{convince}} Sean Connery to return as James Bond, but he declined. At the same time United Artists approached both Batman actor Adam West and Burt Reynolds. Reynolds told the studios that Bond should be played by an Englishman and turned the offer down. Among the actors <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> the part of Bond were Julian Glover, John Gavin, Jeremy Brett, Simon Oates, John Ronane, and William Gaunt. The main frontrunner for the role was Michael Billington. United Artists was still pushing to cast an American to play Bond but producer Albert R. Broccoli insisted that the part should be played by a British actor and put forward Roger Moore. After Moore was chosen, Billington remained {{on the top of}} the list in the event that Moore would decline to come back for the next film. Billington ultimately played a brief role in the pre-credit sequence of The Spy Who Loved Me (1977). Moore, who had been considered by the producers before both Dr. No and On Her Majesty's Secret Service, was ultimately cast. He tried not to imitate either Connery's or his own prior performance as Simon Templar in The Saint, and Mankiewicz fitted the screenplay into Moore's persona by giving more comedy scenes and a light-hearted approach to Bond.|$|E
5|$|Hill {{started his}} Grand Prix career during the 1991 {{season as a}} test driver with the championship-winning Williams team while still {{competing}} in the F3000 series. However, midway through 1992 Hill broke into Grand Prix racing as a driver with the dying Brabham team. The formerly competitive team was in serious financial difficulties. Hill started the season only after three races, replacing Giovanna Amati after her sponsorship had failed to materialise. Amati {{had been unable to}} get the car through qualifying but Hill matched his team-mate, Eric van de Poele, by qualifying for two races, the mid-season British and Hungarian Grands Prix. Hill continued <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> the Williams team that year and the British Grand Prix saw Nigel Mansell win the race for Williams, while he finished last in the Brabham. The Brabham team collapsed after the Hungarian Grand Prix and did not complete the season.|$|E
