25|$|Austrian {{psychiatrist}} Alfred Adler (1870–1937), who parted {{ways with}} Freud, emphasised {{the role of}} goals and motivation in his Individual Psychology. One of Adler's most famous ideas is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> to compensate for inferiorities that we perceive in ourselves. A lack of power often lies {{at the root of}} feelings of inferiority. One way that religion enters into this picture is through our beliefs in God, which are characteristic of our tendency to strive for perfection and superiority. For example, in many religions God is considered to be perfect and omnipotent, and commands people likewise to be perfect. If we, too, achieve perfection, we become one with God. By identifying with God in this way, we compensate for our imperfections and feelings of inferiority.|$|E
25|$|Cruyff is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} typical kind of ‘artist-footballer’ or ‘footballer-thinker’ who considers football, the so-called 'beautiful game', not a purely athletic/physical competition but an artistic-oriented mind-body game. Because of his distinctive footballing views, Cruyff was called ‘the Spinoza of football’ by some. He believed in a certain style of play, which {{has the power to}} put a smile on the people's faces as he described it. When Cruyff, both as a player and as a manager, spoke about football he often mentioned the entertainment value of the game, that there is more to it than winning. In a 2009 interview with Sportmails Martin Samuel, Arsène Wenger, as a devout follower of Cruyff's footballing ideology, once shared his opinion about football's artistic value, “I believe the target of anything in life should be to do it so well that it becomes an art. When you read some books they are fantastic, the writer touches something in you that you know you would not have brought out of yourself. He makes you discover something interesting in your life. If you are living like an animal, {{what is the point of}} living? What makes daily life interesting is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> to transform it to something that is close to art. And football is like that. When I watch Barcelona, it is art.” , the author of Cruyff's French biography, called him ‘the greatest actor in the history of football’ because Cruyff was a glorious exception (possibly the only one ever) being the man who ‘played’ outstandingly well multiple roles in the world of football: player, manager, and thinker.|$|E
500|$|Project 86's {{music is}} {{characterized}} by heavy rock and Schwab's [...] "loud, eerie, and atmospheric" [...] vocal style. Their sound has been likened to rock groups Helmet, Rage Against the Machine, and Tool. The moniker [...] "intense" [...] has frequently {{been used as a}} description. Rick Anderson of Allmusic called the music [...] "dense and crunchy", while Albuquerque Journal writer Ron Gonzales declared it a [...] "blisteringly heavy sound." [...] Commenting on their musical style, Schwab said, [...] "Our goal as a band has been to never make the same record twice. The only rule is that there are no rules. If there is a rule, it's <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> not to over-think things, that the music that comes out is honest and real, spontaneous and from our heart." ...|$|E

500|$|John V. Karavitis, in {{the chapter}} [...] "The Finn-losophy of Adventure Time" [...] from the book Adventure Time and Philosophy, sees the {{situation}} at hand in a different light. According to him, magic and science clearly exist {{within the confines of}} Ooo, but more importantly, they also represent two completely different ways of viewing the world. Science is a way of [...] "observ the world, mak educated guesses about how it works and conduct expierments [...] in order to confirm or disprove our ideas about the world. [...] Science requires that we be rational, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> to actively understand the world, and to take steps to verify our understanding." [...] In this sense, it is the ultimately responsible perspective. Magic, on the other hand, is [...] "the metaphysics of immaturity" [...] because it does not require understanding the reality of the actual world. Magic, according to Karavitis, is therefore an irresponsible perspective to take.|$|E
500|$|With the {{assistance}} of scriptwriter Tony Williamson, Anderson and his wife, Sylvia, had drafted a 194-page treatment long before the initial meeting with Kanter. The Andersons had originally intended to film the script as a one-hour drama for ATV; Sylvia explained that since the concept [...] "was too good for a television play, I suggested to Gerry <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> to develop it as a movie." [...] Responding to claims that Doppelgänger had [...] "dark" [...] scripting, Gerry stated that he wanted the film to have an interesting and entertaining premise. He also discussed {{the significance of the}} title, which was suggested to him by Century 21 co-director John Read: Doppelgänger being [...] "a German word which means 'a copy of oneself', and the legend goes that if you meet your doppelganger, it is the point of your death. Following that legend, clearly, I had to steer the film so that I could end it illustrating the meaning of that word." ...|$|E

[...] YATMA, since 2006 called Educational Mentoring Through the Arts & Humanities (EMTAH), [...] "incorporates strength-based mentoring with progressive fine arts instruction, taps into and develops student potential by promoting creativity and providing early success. Stimulated by their progress, students learn to apply their new skills to other areas of their lives." [...] EMTAH was reviewed in December 2006 at WGBH's Open Source with Christopher Lydon, before the show's cancellation in July 2007.|$|E
2500|$|Of course {{everything}} {{depends on}} the repertoire which is quite large – more than two thousand works. Depending on the concert we choose a special repertoire. We have a rule <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> not to break. In any country we sing 2–3 songs in the native language {{of the people who}} live there. As a rule it helps to find a rapport with, and the appreciation of, the audience. And for us it is some kind of musical gift, to honour the host country and its people. For instance in Canada when we sang the National Anthem of Russia people stood up to show respect to our country, and when we finished we sang their country's anthem Oh, Canada!.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} {{theme is}} written by WAZ and original music for Cougar Town is composed by WAZ, Jamie Jackson, Will Golden and Al Sgro. Bill Lawrence stated; [...] "As a show composer WAZ brings something incredibly special.

As a group we're confident that WAZ will be the next singer/songwriter <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> to claim credit for. He's that good." [...] Songs such as Phoenix's [...] "Lisztomania", Foghat's [...] "Slow Ride", and La Roux's [...] "Bulletproof (Remix)" [...] were all used in the pilot episode. In the second episode, Beyoncé Knowles's [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" [...] and Keren DeBerg's [...] "Today" [...] as well as [...] "Tell Me" [...] were used on the show. A full version of the theme song was released in February 2012 to coincide with the shows return.|$|E
