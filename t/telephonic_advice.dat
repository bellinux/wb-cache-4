When <b>telephonic</b> <b>advice</b> was sought from the rheumatologists, they did not suspect a fracture as there was no history of trauma. As she was already on steroids, they felt that it was unlikely to be an exacerbation of her rheumatoid arthritis. Hence, she was asked to keep her normal follow-up clinical appointment to see them. In view of her persisting symptoms, radiographs were organised by her general practitioner and she was then referred to the fracture clinic for further opinion.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Implementing quality {{improvement}} programs that require behavior {{change on the}} part of health care professionals and patients has proven difficult in routine care. Significant randomized trial evidence supports creating fall prevention programs for community-dwelling older adults, but adoption in routine care has been limited. Nationally-collected data indicated that our local facility could improve its performance on fall prevention in community-dwelling older people. We sought to develop a sustainable local fall prevention program, using theory to guide program development. Methods We planned program development to include important stakeholders within our organization. The theory-derived plan consisted of 1) an initial leadership meeting to agree on whether creating a fall prevention program was a priority for the organization, 2) focus groups with patients and health care professionals to develop ideas for the program, 3) monthly workgroup meetings with representatives from key departments to develop a blueprint for the program, 4) a second leadership meeting to confirm that the blueprint developed by the workgroup was satisfactory, and also to solicit feedback on ideas for program refinement. Results The leadership and workgroup meetings occurred as planned and {{led to the development of}} a functional program. The focus groups did not occur as planned, mainly due to the complexity of obtaining research approval for focus groups. The fall prevention program uses an existing <b>telephonic</b> nurse <b>advice</b> line to 1) place outgoing calls to patients at high fall risk, 2) assess these patients' risk factors for falls, and 3) triage these patients to the appropriate services. The workgroup continues to meet monthly to monitor the progress of the program and improve it. Conclusion A theory-driven program development process has resulted in the successful initial implementation of a fall prevention program. </p...|$|R
40|$|Disease {{management}} has gained popularity {{as a way}} to improve health status and control of chronic illness through the use of risk stratification, targeted nurse outreach, <b>telephonic</b> nurse <b>advice,</b> and evidence-based guidelines in managing illness. Disease management programs have been successfully implemented by commercial insurers and managed care plans, as well as in Medicare and state Medicaid programs. Although evidence regarding cost savings is inconsistent, it appears that disease management programs do impact health status and quality of care, and improve self-management among the chronically ill. Disease management programs can be customized {{to meet the needs of}} vulnerable subpopulations. This article explores the barriers to dealing with chronic illness and other factors faced by disease management programs for Medicaid populations. Barriers to participation and success in disease management for Medicaid beneficiaries are apparent due to lack of access to translation and interpretation services; difficulty with community outreach; achieving buy in from providers and beneficiaries; problems with housing; difficulties accessing primary and specialty care; problems with the availability of pharmacy, durable medical equipment, and other support services; as well as difficulties with Medicaid eligibility and In order to create a successful disease management program that positively impacts health status, utilization, and cost, it is necessary to consider all of these barriers when designing an intervention for Medicaid beneficiaries. Some of the innovative ways to handle the difficulties of dealing with Medicaid or other low-income populations with special healthcare needs include expanded interpretation and translation activities, extensive community outreach to patients and safety net providers such as clinics and public hospitals, providing support services related to non-medical problems experienced by enrollees, providing understandable written and verbal instructions and training related to health education and medication adherence, as well as efforts to track and maintain contact with eligible and enrolled individuals. Disease management programs can be successful in saving money and improving health in Medicaid populations. However, they must be carefully designed with the specific state Medicaid program and should target the needs of the state DOI: 10. 2165 / 0115677 - 200816060 - 00007 Disease-management-programmes, Health-insurance...|$|R
