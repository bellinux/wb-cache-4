40|$|<b>Travelling</b> <b>abroad</b> for <b>medical</b> treatment, {{also known}} as {{healthcare}} tourism is a growing phenomenon. Medical tourism is a provision of cost effective private medical care by corporate hospitals such as Apollo and Fortis, {{in partnership with the}} government, medical and the tourism industry to foreign patients needing elective, diagnostic, cosmetic surgery and alternative therapies who are travelling to India in search of value. The Minister of Finance, in the 10 th 2003 - 2007 budget speech, called for India to become a world class “Global Health Destination” and attracting foreign direct investment as a pathway for economic development. Thus on one hand, India is providing first world quality of medical treatment to foreign patients and on the other hand, is struggling to provide equitable access to primary healthcare and infrastructure for millions living in poverty. The aim {{of this paper is to}} critically examine the sustainable and inclusive (pro-poor) development of healthcare services by the private corporate sector, in public-private partnership (PPP) with the government...|$|R

40|$|Imposing the {{principles}} of sustainable development on medical tourism is vital to maintaining the three pillars of a strong nation, namely, the environment, the economy, and the local community. The three research objectives of this thesis are: 1) to determine the primary factors that motivate foreign patients to <b>travel</b> <b>abroad</b> for <b>medical</b> services; 2) to define the role that stakeholders play for developing the medical tourism sector; and 3) to develop an implementable framework for establishing a sustainable medical facility. These objectives help lay the foundations for a medical tourism facility that would respond well to the future demands of international patients, and would remain competitive with other medical facilities in the global market while also improving local quality-of-life and remaining within ecological constraints. Therefore, this research adopts a case study methodology to examine a framework developed through the literature review to determine how it fits in reality. In addition, this research provides a starting point to define further the primary roles of the medical tourism network for developing the medical tourism sector...|$|R

40|$|Medical {{tourism is}} a global {{phenomenon}} and the number one growing niche segment of the tourism industry. It is a sub-set of health tourism. There are many reasons why people travel to another country and become medical tourists; such as high health and insurance costs, long waiting lists, {{and the absence of}} the latest medical procedures and technology in their home countries. In addition, low surgical cost, latest medical technology, no waiting period, internationally accredited medical facilities and qualified staff in Thailand, India, Malaysia, Mexico and Poland make them attractive destinations for medical treatment. Thus, increasing numbers of people are making an informed personal healthcare decision to obtain the best outcome at an affordable price with no waiting period. Multiple regression analysis was used to test the two hypotheses. This research provides insights into the importance of two key factors such as cost and waiting period in the process of making a decision to <b>travel</b> <b>abroad</b> for <b>medical</b> treatment. Research findings suggest that low surgical cost and no waiting period for elective surgery, compared to their country of origin is the key driver for potential patients to significantly increase the demand and travel overseas for medical procedures to improve their health and wellbeing...|$|R

Medical tourists are making informed decisions to travel for medical treatment or procedures based on comparing the price and qaulity of health care service provision by the hospitals involved in medical tourism in different countries, such as Thailand, India, Singapore, Malaysia, South-Africa, Poland, Dubai, Mexico or Venezuela. Two key hypothesis were tested that drives the medical tourism industry and the results concured with the literature that low surgical cost and internationally accredited qaulity of medical care and service provision will positively influence the decision to <b>travel</b> <b>abroad</b> for <b>medical</b> treatment. This is possible only if information is provided by the healthcare providers and accrediting bodies like Joint Commission International so that comparisons and informed decisions based on cost and quality can be made...|$|R
5000|$|Apart from {{promoting}} his family, Zhivkov instituted a complex system of privileges which extended to former Resistance figures, Party members and prominenti of the sciences, arts and manufacture. In the early 1960s, he {{was instrumental in}} constructing a large set of housing, financial, educational, electoral and other benefits to be granted to a large category of people called [...] "Active Fighters against Capitalism and Fascism" [...] who had ostensibly been members of the rather modest Bulgarian Wartime resistance and which was expanded to absurd proportions. Without necessarily receiving great remuneration (pay differentials under Zhivkov were within the 5:1 range, with {{the overwhelming majority of}} salaries being within the 3:1 range), Party members and CSS informers received very significant perquisites which involved access to accommodation, luxury imported goods, hard currency, the ability to <b>travel</b> <b>abroad,</b> superior <b>medical</b> and dental treatment and unhindered entry to higher education for their children. The scope of these privileges broadened as they rose in the Party hierarchy. Eminent artists, scientists and [...] "Heroes of Socialist Labour" [...] (mostly collective farmers and shop-floor workers) received similar privileges.

40|$|Globally, {{medical tourism}} {{is one of}} the fastest growing {{healthcare}} service sectors. Various hospitals in countries such as Thailand, India, Singapore, Malaysia, Mexico, Switzerland, Poland or Austria, offer complex state of the art surgeries, non-surgical diagnostic and other alternative treatments. When making a decision to <b>travel</b> <b>abroad</b> for <b>medical</b> treatment, potential medical tourism consumers use a variety of sources of information to find information about countries and speciality hospitals. Sources range from previous personal experience, through family, friends, to print and television media, personal physician, medical travel agent, health insurance policy provider, medical tourism advertising campaigns and trade fairs. It is widely acknowledged that there is an enormous amount of health and medical tourism related information available on the internet. The way medical patients as consumers search, choose, evaluate and appraise information, regarding their choice of country, destination within the country, hospital, doctor and holiday is important, since sources of information about availability of treatment, doctors, hospital accreditation and destination country can influence a consumer’s decision to travel, or not to travel, overseas for treatment to improve their health and well-being. However, the information available is of variable quality. The search cost, time and information search skills of potential medical consumers affect their selection and assessment of information about the treatment, physician, hospital and destination suited to their health and medical related travel purposes. However, there is little empirical research into medical tourism information search, so the qualitative research of Medhekar and Newby (2012) is drawn upon to provide the foundation for the research study into medical tourism information search reported in this paper. The objective of this empirical paper is to explore the information search techniques of medical tourists as consumers of medical tourism products and services using quantitative data and to investigate medical tourists’ experiences in searching for and appraising various sources of medical tourism related information before embarking on their journey <b>abroad</b> for <b>medical</b> tourism...|$|R

40|$|Medical Tourism' - the {{phenomenon}} of people <b>travelling</b> <b>abroad</b> to access <b>medical</b> treatment - has received increasing attention in academic and popular media. This paper reports findings from a study examining effect of inbound and outbound medical tourism on the UK NHS, by estimating volume of medical tourism and associated costs and benefits. A mixed methods study it includes analysis of the UK International Passenger Survey (IPS); interviews with 77 returning UK medical tourists, 63 policymakers, NHS managers and medical tourism industry actors policymakers, and a review of published literature. These informed costing of three types of treatments for which patients commonly travel abroad: fertility treatment, cosmetic and bariatric surgery. Costing of inbound tourism relied on data obtained through 28 Freedom-of-Information requests to NHS Foundation Trusts. Findings demonstrate that contrary to some popular media reports, {{far from being a}} net importer of patients, the UK is now a clear net exporter of medical travellers. In 2010, an estimated 63, 000 UK residents travelled for treatment, while around 52, 000 patients sought treatment in the UK. Inbound medical tourists treated as private patients within NHS facilities may be especially profitable when compared to UK private patients, yielding close to a quarter of revenue from only 7 % of volume in the data examined. Costs arise where patients <b>travel</b> <b>abroad</b> and return with complications. Analysis also indicates possible savings especially in future health care and social costs averted. These are likely to be specific to procedures and conditions treated. UK medical tourism is a growing phenomenon that presents risks and opportunities to the NHS. To fully understand its implications and guide policy on issues such as NHS global activities and patient safety will require investment in further research and monitoring. Results point to likely impact of medical tourism in other universal public health systems...|$|R

40|$|<b>Travelling</b> <b>abroad</b> for <b>medical</b> treatment, {{also known}} as {{healthcare}} tourism is a growing phenomenon. Medical tourism is a provision of cost effective private medical care by corporate hospitals such as Apollo, Wockhardt, Sancheti and Fortis, {{in partnership with the}} government, medical and the tourism industry for patients needing elective, diagnostic, cosmetic surgery and alternative therapies. Many patients from developed as well as developing countries of South Asia and Africa are travelling to India for complex medical treatment in search of value for money. In 2009, India was ranked second only to Thailand as a medical destination due to low cost of surgery and number of medical tourists. Individual states such as Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra in partnership with private corporate sector hospitals are promoting and attracting foreign tourists for highly complex surgical procedures such as hip and knee replacements, cancer treatment, dental, reproductive and organ transplant. Given the privatisation and private finance initiatives during the 1990 Rao-reforms, healthcare provision was opened to corporate sector attracting foreign direct investment. This also led to the adoption of WHO macroeconomic health strategy of investment in health, as a pathway for economic development for developing countries. The Minister of Finance, in the 10 th 2003 - 2007 budget speech called for India to become a world class “Global Health Destination”. Thus on one hand, India is providing world class quality of medical treatment in state-of-the- art facilities to foreign patients and on the other hand, is struggling to provide equitable access to health infrastructure and basic primary healthcare for millions living in poverty. The aim {{of this paper is to}} examine the sustainable and inclusive development of medical tourism in India by the corporate private sector. The introductory section of the paper provides a background to the medical tourism industry provided by the corporate sector. Section two puts forward a brief literature review on medical tourism.
