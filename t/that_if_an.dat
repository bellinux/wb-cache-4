5|$|The Court also {{rejected}} {{the proposition that}} the principle of proportionality be recognized as a separate ground for judicial review.

5|$|However, with Moltke crippled, Admiral Scheer {{decided to}} return to base. Though {{scouting}} units of the Grand Fleet made brief contact with the Germans on the morning of 25 April, no action followed, and the High Seas Fleet made it home without incident. At one point in the chase, however, a reversal of course by the Germans meant that the entire Grand Fleet was forced to reorient itself in the opposite direction, placing Battleship Division Nine in the van. The result was <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> encounter between the two fleets had occurred, American battleships would have led the British fleet into what could have been the largest naval battle of the war.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the significant lack of genetic diversity in cheetahs is a cause of poor quality and production of sperm, and birth defects such as cramped teeth, kinked tails, and bent limbs. Cheetahs do have low fertility rates, but they appear to have flourished for thousands of years with these low levels of genetic variance. Cheetah expert Laurie Marker points out that the high level of genetic uniformity would mean <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> infectious disease surfaced in a population, all of them have (or lack) the same level of immunity. In 1982, 60% of the cheetah population in the Wildlife Safari (Oregon, United States) died due to a peritonitis epidemic.|$|E
5|$|It {{rejects the}} Christian {{emphasis}} on sin and guilt, believing that these generate fear and thus negativity, which then hinder spiritual evolution. It also typically criticises the blaming and judging of others for their actions, believing <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> individual adopts these negative attitudes it harms their own spiritual evolution. Instead the movement emphasizes positive thinking, although beliefs regarding the power behind such thoughts vary within New Age literature. Common New Age {{examples of how}} to generate such positive thinking include the repeated recitation of mantras and statements carrying positive messages, and the visualisation of a white light.|$|E
5|$|The Irenaean theodicy is a {{response}} to the evidential problem of evil which raises the problem <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God exists, there should be no evil in the world. Evidence of evil in the world would make the existence of God improbable. The theodicy attempts to demonstrate that the existence of God remains probable, despite the occurrence of evil.|$|E

5|$|Upon the {{official}} Belgian {{withdrawal from the}} Western Alliance, the Belgians refused to engage in any official staff meetings with the French or British military staff for fear of compromising its neutrality.

5|$|Project Gemini {{followed}} on from Project Mercury, {{taking its}} name {{from the fact that it}} carried two men instead of just one. After the Mercury-Atlas 10 mission was cancelled, Shepard was designated as the commander of the first manned Gemini mission, with Thomas P. Stafford chosen as his pilot. In late 1963, Shepard began to experience episodes of extreme dizziness and nausea, accompanied by a loud, clanging noise in the left ear. He tried to keep it secret, fearing that he would lose his flight status, but was aware <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> episode occurred in the air or in space it could be fatal. Following an episode during a lecture in Houston, where he had recently moved from Virginia Beach, Virginia, Shepard was forced to confess his ailment to Slayton, who was now Director Flight Operations, and seek help from NASA's doctors.|$|E
5|$|The Internal Security Act allows {{persons to}} be {{detained}} without trial for acting {{in any manner}} prejudicial {{to the security of}} Malaysia or to the maintenance of its essential services or economic life. It is authorized by Article 149 of the Malaysian Constitution, which stipulates <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> Act recites that action has been taken or threatened by any substantial body of persons, whether inside or outside the Federation in respect of certain situations – including organized violence against persons or property, the excitement of disaffection against the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or the government, or the promotion of feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population likely to cause violence – then any provision of that law designed to stop or prevent that action is valid notwithstanding that it is inconsistent with certain articles of the Constitution guaranteeing fundamental liberties. Upon Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965, the island republic retained both the Internal Security Act and Article 149 of the Constitution in its statute book.|$|E

5|$|The Law Society asked Coopers & Lybrand {{to produce}} {{a report on the}} Law Society, which {{included}} its disciplinary topics among the areas to be reported on. The draft report, published in 1984, recommended that the Law Society should transfer its disciplinary processes to an independent Solicitor's Complaints Board, which would be made up of both solicitors and lay people (although with a majority of its members being solicitors). In 1985 the National Consumer Council published a survey showing that only 15% of respondents felt that the Law Society should be investigating complaints, and only 5% felt <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> independent body was created it should contain a solicitor majority, with 36% wanting equal representation of solicitors and lay people and 55% preferring a majority of lay people.|$|E
5|$|From {{before midnight}} on 27 March, the tired 12th Brigade {{had been holding}} the railway line between Albert and Dernancourt, having {{relieved}} the 9th (Scottish) Division. The forward positions of the salient held by the 12th Brigade were along the railway line, which ran along a series of embankments and cuttings, up to but not including a railway bridge immediately northwest of Dernancourt where the Dernancourt–Laviéville road passed under the railway. A mushroom-shaped feature known as the Laviéville Heights overlooked the railway line, which curved around its foot. This was difficult ground to defend, particularly where the railway line curved and skirted the northwestern corner of Dernancourt, as if the line there was overrun, the enemy {{would be able to}} fire into the rear of the troops lined out along the railway in both directions. Despite this, the Australian commanders considered it important to hold the railway line; if it was not garrisoned, the enemy could assemble in the dead ground behind the embankment. A further difficulty arose from the fact <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> attack occurred during daylight, it would be almost impossible to move troops down the exposed slopes to reinforce the railway line without crippling losses, and troops withdrawing from the railway line would be similarly exposed. To afford them some protection along the railway line, the forward posts dug one-man niches in the near side of the embankment, but the only way for them to fire was to climb up and lie on top of the embankment, thus exposing themselves to enemy fire.|$|E
