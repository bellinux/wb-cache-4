5|$|Acting on a {{tip from}} Strax, the Doctor visits the Great Intelligence Institute posing as Sherlock Holmes. He confronts Dr. Simeon and find a large glass globe in Simeon's office that {{contains}} psychic snow. The Doctor speaks to the Great Intelligence, the entity that has been speaking to Dr. Simeon {{since he was a}} boy. He learns that the Great Intelligence has been controlling the snowmen and has taken interest in Latimer's pond. The Doctor visits <b>the</b> <b>pond</b> <b>and</b> deduces that the Great Intelligence is using the old governess' body as a DNA blueprint to form an ice creature that will retain its form and not melt. While Clara is putting the children to bed, the frozen body of the governess breaks into the house. The Doctor fights her off and is joined by Vastra, Jenny and Strax. Dr. Simeon arrives with more snowmen and tells them he wants the governess' ice body. The Doctor flees with Clara to the roof of the mansion and then to the TARDIS hovering overhead. They are pursued by the ice governess, whom the Doctor traps under a layer of frozen ice crystals. Inside the TARDIS the Doctor gives Clara a TARDIS key, but the ice governess arrives and pulls Clara down off the cloud.|$|E
5|$|Located on the {{property}} of Ambler's Texaco Gas Station, {{just north of the}} station, is a 24-foot (7.3 m) by 16 foot (4.9m) wood clad, wooden frame building that once housed a commercial icehouse. Though its exact dates of operation are unknown, it is believed the icehouse was established by a member of Jack Schore's family during the 1930s. While the icehouse was in business, there was a small pond located about 200feet (61m) east of {{the property}}. Operators cut ice from <b>the</b> <b>pond</b> <b>and</b> stored it in the building until sale. After the icehouse ceased operation, a date that is also unknown, the building was used as a storage shed for the gas station. The building features a double wall with sawdust stuffed in between the walls to provide insulation. The wooden roof has asphalt shingles. Ambler's Texaco Station listing on the National Register lists the icehouse building as a contributing property.|$|E

25|$|The {{alligators}} {{were the}} central attraction and thrived. At {{one time the}} pond contained {{as many as seven}} of the reptiles. Most visitors to the park would rest on the wall surrounding <b>the</b> <b>pond</b> <b>and</b> watch the alligators. The reptiles quickly became a staple of the El Paso Culture. In 1952, an alligator named Oscar was hauled to Texas Western College and, as a prank, placed inside geology Professor Howard Quinn's office. On another occasion an alligator was found in the swimming pool at the college right before an intramural swim meet. Sally, one of the first alligators placed in the pond, was the object of a weight-guessing contest. The closest guess won $100 and a trip to Mexico. In 1952, Minnie, a 54-year-old female alligator, laid an egg in <b>the</b> <b>pond</b> <b>and</b> spectators were delighted when they saw a protective Minnie spring to life and rush towards her egg as park employees cleaned the pond.|$|E

25|$|Indian carps and {{stinging}} catfish are cultured in Bangladesh, but {{the methods}} {{could be more}} productive. <b>The</b> <b>pond</b> <b>and</b> cage cultures used are based only on the fish. They don't {{take advantage of the}} productivity increases that could take place if other trophic levels were included. Expensive artificial feeds are used, partly to supply the fish with protein. These costs could be reduced if freshwater snails, such as Viviparus bengalensis, were simultaneously cultured, thus increasing the available protein. The organic and inorganic wastes produced as a byproduct of culturing could also be minimized by integrating freshwater snail and aquatic plants, such as water spinach, respectively.|$|E

25|$|Another notable {{instance}} of religious warfare was perpetrated by Nhu's right-hand man in 1963. A hugely oversized carp was found {{swimming in a}} small pond near Đà Nẵng. Local Buddhists began {{to believe that the}} fish was a reincarnation of one of Gautama Buddha's disciples. As more people made pilgrimages to the pond, Ngô family officials mined <b>the</b> <b>pond</b> <b>and</b> raked it with machine gun fire, but the fish survived. Nhu's special forces grenaded the pond, finally killing the fish. This backfired, however, because it generated more publicity — newspapers across the world ran stories about the miraculous fish. ARVN helicopters began landing at the site, and paratroopers filled their bottles with water they believed to be magical.|$|E
25|$|Usually {{the chair}} was {{fastened}} to a long wooden beam fixed as a seesaw {{on the edge of}} a pond or river. Sometimes, however, the ducking-stool was not a fixture but was mounted on a pair of wooden wheels so that it could be wheeled through the streets, and at the river-edge was hung by a chain from the end of a beam. In sentencing a woman the magistrates ordered the number of duckings she should have. Yet another type of ducking-stool was called a tumbrel. It was a chair on two wheels with two long shafts fixed to the axles. This was pushed into <b>the</b> <b>pond</b> <b>and</b> then the shafts released, thus tipping the chair up backwards. Sometimes the punishment proved fatal and the victim died.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> Yoncalla Log <b>Ponds</b> are {{a series}} of four ponds located in within the city limits of the town in Yoncalla in {{northern}} Douglas County, Oregon. <b>The</b> <b>ponds</b> were created in stages between the late 1930 s and the 1950 s and used for log storage through the 1970 s (North Douglas Betterment 2014). North Douglas Betterment purchased the land surrounding <b>the</b> <b>ponds</b> <b>and</b> contracted with <b>the</b> Center for Lakes and Reservoirs at Portland State University to assess the current morphometry, vegetation and water quality status of <b>the</b> <b>ponds</b> <b>and</b> provide recommendations for management of the aquatic vegetation.

25|$|In late 2007, {{the city}} drained the Woodland Pond to {{construct}} a pavilion on its shore along with repairs to the pond itself using city funds and private donations. Other work was done to the pedestrian bridges and the walkways around <b>the</b> <b>pond,</b> <b>and</b> two waterfalls were added. On May 17, 2008, the Woodland Pond viewing pavilion was dedicated and the pond area re-opened along with a new water feature. Construction of the new items and renovations totaled approximately $225,000 in costs. Plans call for connecting the park via a nature park and trail along Rock Creek to northeast Hillsboro and other parks in the city, eventually crossing north of the Sunset Highway. The park closed for a day in July 2014 due to reports of a cougar.|$|E
25|$|The {{site was}} {{discovered}} in 1982 when work began on building a road across the pond in a new housing development, Windover Farms. A backhoe operator noticed several skulls in the bucket of his machine. The sheriff and medical examiner determined that the burials were not recent. The local forensic expert originally believed he was examining modern Caucasian remains. The developers, Jack Eckerd and Jim Swann, halted construction at <b>the</b> <b>pond</b> <b>and</b> called in archaeologists. Radiocarbon dating on two bones excavated from the pond by the backhoe, {{paid for by the}} developers, yielded dates of 7,210 years and 7,320 years Before Present, establishing the importance of the find. The developers changed their development plans in order to leave the pond intact and donated $60,000 worth of pumping equipment to drain the pond for excavation.|$|E
25|$|A {{grove of}} Japanese cherry trees exists along a roadway from near Grenadier Cafe leading down to Grenadier Pond, with {{spectacular}} blooms in late April to early May. The grove {{is one of}} several plantings of Japanese cherry trees in the park. The others are along West Road, the shore of <b>the</b> <b>pond</b> <b>and</b> west of the Jamie Bell playground. In 1959, the first Japanese Somei-Yoshino Cherry Tree was planted in High Park, a gift from the citizens of Tokyo. A plaque marks the spot in 1959 where the trees were presented by the Japanese ambassador to Toronto mayor Nathan Phillips. Over 2000 cherry trees were donated to Toronto. Another 34 cherry trees were donated to High Park in 2001 from the Sakura project. These were planted around the Maple Leaf garden on the eastern shore of the pond. In 2006 a further 16 were planted in the park.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Assessment of river-fishpond {{surface water}} {{circulation}} is recognised {{as to be}} of critical importance in the Upper Vistula river catchment (southern Poland). The Vistula river is characterised by a high flow in spring, partly retained in numerous fishponds, and a low flow in autumn. Evaluation of the water circulation cycle {{is based on an}} equation of pond water balance. Water balance components include regulated inflow to <b>the</b> <b>ponds</b> <b>and</b> regulated outflow from <b>the</b> <b>ponds,</b> precipitation, <b>and</b> evaporation. Results have been obtained during four-year monitoring period. Waters circulation between <b>the</b> <b>ponds</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> river has been computed for the annual hydrological cycle and for three periods; November – April, May – September and October. The three periods differ in the absolute magnitudes of the water balance components and, in the relative magnitudes of the components. Deviation from the normal pluviometric conditions during the considered years has been evaluated by comparing the current results with results of a thirty-year precipitation monitoring...|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} grand plaza {{has undergone}} several extensive renovations, with radical {{changes in its}} appearance and utility. Prior to the 1960s there were extensive brick plazas, few trees, and a few large, simple, raised, and circular ponds with central fountains, all in a style that discouraged loitering. The plaza was then extensively excavated for underground parking. At this time a central rectangular pond, with an extensive array of water vents (strangely, all in several strict rows and all pointing east, with identical arcs of water, and completely without sculptural embellishment), was added, with extensive groves of trees (again, in 60s modernist style, planted with absolute military precision on rectangular grids). In the 1990s, {{with the rise of}} the problem of homelessness, the plaza was once again remodeled to make it somewhat less habitable—although the most significant change, the replacement of <b>the</b> <b>pond</b> <b>and</b> pumps with a lawn, could be reasonably justified on the basis of energy and water conservation.|$|E
25|$|Also {{nearby is}} Beeston Common, {{consisting}} of 24.7 hectares/61 acres of grassland, heath, marsh, fen and secondary woodland. The common {{was made a}} Site of Special Scientific Interest/SA6 in the year 2000 and is habitat {{for a wide range}} of mammals, birds, and insects. There are some forty species of rare flowering plants, and fourteen species of British orchids have been recorded on the common due to its special soil conditions. With such a variety of flowers the site is attractive to butterflies. Twenty-six species have been regularly recorded, including green hairstreak, brown argus and Essex skipper. Kingfisher and heron are also visitors to <b>the</b> <b>pond,</b> <b>and</b> no fewer than 19 species of dragonfly/damselfly have been observed. The bird life of the common includes varieties such as chiffchaff, willow warbler, blackcap, common whitethroat, lesser whitethroat, reed warbler and occasionally sedge and grasshopper warblers. Nightjars are occasionally heard. Foxes and muntjac deer along with smaller mammals such as water shrew, field voles, and harvest mice are present. Adders, slowworms and common lizards can also be found on the common.|$|E
25|$|Normally, {{the purpose}} of the dam is to provide water around their lodges that is deep enough that it does not freeze solid in winter. The dams also flood areas of {{surrounding}} forest, giving the beaver safe access to an important food supply, which is the leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees. They prefer aspen and poplar, but also take birch, maple, willow, alder, black cherry, red oak, beech, ash, hornbeam, and occasionally pine and spruce. They also eat cattails, water lilies, and other aquatic vegetation, especially in the early spring (and contrary to widespread belief, they do not eat fish). In areas where their pond freezes over, beavers collect food in late fall in the form of tree branches, storing them under water (usually by sticking the sharp chewed base of the branches into the mud on the pond bottom), where they can be accessed through the winter. Often, the pile of food branches projects above <b>the</b> <b>pond</b> <b>and</b> collects snow. This insulates the water below it and keeps the pond open at that location.|$|E
