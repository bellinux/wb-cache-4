The Crew's ownership believed that Schmid {{had been in}} contact with Sounders FC despite being denied permission to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> teams during the season. It was also alleged that he shared confidential information with Seattle after his contract with the Crew had ended. The MLS ruled that no tampering had occurred, but ordered Sounders FC to financially compensate the Crew.|$|E
5|$|From a {{historical}} perspective, however, Robertson's most important contribution was made {{not on a}} basketball court, but rather {{in a court of}} law. It was the year of the landmark Robertson v. National Basketball Ass'n, an antitrust suit filed by the NBA's Players Association against the league. As Robertson was the president of the Players Association, the case bore his name. In this suit, the proposed merger between the NBA and American Basketball Association was delayed until 1976, and the college draft as well as the free agency clauses were reformed. Robertson himself stated that the main reason was that clubs basically owned their players: players were forbidden to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> clubs once their contract was up, because free agency did not exist back then. Six years after the suit was filed, the NBA finally reached a settlement, the ABA–NBA merger took place, and the Oscar Robertson suit encouraged signing of more free agents and eventually led to higher salaries for all players.|$|E
5|$|Sam & Max Hit the Road is a 2D {{adventure}} {{game where}} the player controls {{the actions of}} Sam from a third-person perspective. The player uses Sam to explore the pre-rendered cartoon environments {{of the game and}} solve a series of puzzles using a simple point-and-click interface. The game's puzzles have logical solutions, although a number of them have far-fetched solutions due to the game's cartoon setting. Players can set the game's cursor in a particular mode to designate how Sam interacts with the environment: Sam can walk around an area, <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> characters, look at objects, pick them up or otherwise try to use them. The cursor's graphic changes when it is hovered over an in-game entity that Sam can interact with. When talking to another character, the player is given a choice of subject areas to discuss, depicted in a conversation tree as icons {{at the base of the}} screen. In addition to specific topics involving the game's plot, Sam can inject unconnected exclamations, questions and non sequiturs into a conversation.|$|E

5|$|The {{player can}} {{navigate}} {{and interact with}} the game's environment, mainly carriages on the Orient Express, through use of a context-sensitive cursor. The cursor changes when it is placed over an item with which the player can interact, {{and can be used}} to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> characters, listen to other characters' conversations, look around the environment, and move. The player can walk to a location with a single click, and run to a location with a double-click. Double-clicking {{on the edge of the}} screen instantly takes the player to the next screen. There is a map of the train in the game's interface at the top of the screen, and once each carriage has been unlocked, the player can click on any part of the map and instantly be transported to that location, saving the player from having to travel through the train screen by screen. Another accessible feature is an objectives menu interface which states the general tasks the player should be attempting to complete. This menu is designed to guide players in the right direction without giving any explicit hints.|$|E

Although the Rockets continued to negotiate with Louisville, Kentucky, a funding plan for the arena in Houston was released in June. A final agreement was proposed on July 6, and both the Rockets and mayor Brown agreed to the terms. After the city council approved the deal, the proposal was placed on the November referendum ballot. Leading up to the vote, the Rockets stressed that there would be [...] "no new taxes of any kind", although opponents said the new arena would raise energy consumption, and also contended that the public would pay for too much of the costs of the arena. Contributions for the campaign for the arena included donations of US$400,000 from Reliant Energy, and a total of $590,000 in loans and contributions from Enron and Ken Lay, who the Rockets said was a [...] "tireless" [...] force in the campaign. [...] On November 8, the arena was approved by 66% of voters.|$|E

2500|$|At {{medium wave}} and shortwave {{frequencies}} (MF and HF bands) radio waves can refract from {{a layer of}} charged particles (ions) high in the atmosphere, called the ionosphere. [...] So radio waves transmitted at an angle into the sky can be reflected back to Earth beyond the horizon, at great distances, even transcontinental distances. [...] This is called skywave or [...] "skip" [...] propagation. [...] It is used by amateur radio operators to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> countries, and shortwave broadcasting stations that broadcast internationally. [...] Skywave communication is variable, dependent on conditions in the upper atmosphere; it is most reliable at night and in the winter. [...] Due to its unreliability, {{since the advent of}} communication satellites in the 1960s many long range communication needs that previously used skywaves now use satellites.|$|E

In a speech to students and academics in Mashhad, he {{was quoted as saying}} that Iran's conditions had changed completely as it had become a nuclear state and could <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> states from that stand. On 13 April 2006, Iran's news agency, Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), quoted Ahmadinejad as saying that the peaceful Iranian nuclear technology would not pose a threat to any party because [...] "we want peace and stability and we will not cause injustice to anyone {{and at the same time}} we will not submit to injustice." [...] Nevertheless, Iran's nuclear policy under Ahmadinejad's administration has received much criticism, spearheaded by the United States and Israel. The accusations include that Iran is striving to obtain nuclear arms and developing long-range firing capabilities—and that Ahmadinejad issued an order to keep UN inspectors from freely visiting the nation's nuclear facilities and viewing their designs, in defiance of an IAEA resolution. Following a May 2009 test launch of a long-range missile, Ahmadinejad was quoted as telling the crowd that with its nuclear program, Iran was sending the West a message that [...] "the Islamic Republic of Iran is running the show." ...|$|E

[...] In fact, political briefings were routinely given to appointees in previous administrations as well, according to publications and news articles.

[...] "There is no prohibition under the Hatch Act of allowing political appointees to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> political appointees about the political landscape {{in which they are}} trying to advance the president's agenda."

Ming-Ming sometimes tries to take on big problems by herself and in one episode ("Save the Duckling") she even becomes the animal that needed rescuing. Ming-Ming often provides comic relief in the show, and is the Wonder Pet mostly likely to use irony and mild sarcasm. In [...] "Kalamazoo!", during school holiday she visits her Aunt Eleanora at a local petting zoo. Ming-Ming is voiced by Danica Lee in the United States version. When Lee auditioned for the role, she changes the words from [...] "R" [...] to [...] "W" [...] sounds like a child would speak (as in [...] "This is Se-wious!").
