5|$|Birth {{control is}} another consideration: women with SCI {{are usually not}} {{prescribed}} oral contraceptives since the hormones in them {{increase the risk of}} blood clots, for which people with SCI are already at elevated risk.

Diaphrams that require something to be inserted into the vagina are not usable by people with poor hand function. An option of choice for women is for partners to use condoms.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the episode came from Matt Groening, who had wanted to do an episode in which Mr. Burns was shot, {{which could be used}} as a {{publicity}} stunt. The writers decided to write the episode in two parts with a mystery that could be used in a contest. It was important for them to design a mystery that had clues, took advantage of freeze frame technology, and was structured around one character who seemed to be the obvious culprit. While deciding who the culprit was, Oakley and Weinstein pitched Barney Gumble because he was a character <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> to jail and it could change the dynamic of the show. Mirkin suggested Maggie because he felt it was funnier and wanted the culprit to be a Simpsons family member. Oakley and Weinstein were initially unsure about having Maggie as the culprit, and it was decided that the episode would end with Maggie shifting her eyes and making it look like it was not a complete accident.|$|E

25|$|Between 1970 and 1989, the {{official}} exchange rate was fixed by the government through law. This exchange rate {{was used by the}} government to calculate the value of foreign trade, but foreign currency was not available to be bought and sold by private individuals. Owning or attempting to buy or sell foreign currency was a criminal offence, punishable with a prison sentence <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> up to 10 years (depending on the amount of foreign currency found under one's possession). International trade was therefore considered as part of another economic circuit than domestic trade, and given greater priority.|$|E
25|$|Cardiacs toured and gigged {{intermittently}} during 1990, {{culminating in}} a shared concert with Napalm Death at Salisbury Arts Centre on 30 August. The Cardiacs half of the concert was filmed and released as the video Maresnest (produced by Steve Mallet and directed by Steve Payne, and eventually also released as the 1995 live album All that Glitters is a Mares Nest). The band performed as a seven-piece, with Sarah Smith making a one-day return as a band member. Although the concert has achieved legendary status amongst Cardiacs fans, {{it was also an}} occasion on which everything <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> wrong, did go wrong. Among other things, Tim Smith's guitar fell apart and keys fell off Sarah Smith's saxophone.|$|E
25|$|A {{well trained}} soldier could fire {{up to three}} rounds per minute, {{and the use of}} the platoon {{formation}} by the British army meant that a constant volley of fire could be employed. There was much <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> wrong with the musket– from misfires in wet weather, to the gun firing at random due to sparks which set the powder off. In the heat of battle a soldier may forget to remove the ramrod from the barrel before firing. Nonetheless, the musket proved to be an overall reliable weapon which's performance, especially when used en masse, should not be underestimated. Even though contemporary writers often state that a musket's effective range when firing at an individual target did not go beyond 30 paces, modern test firings at individual human-sized targets suggest that a musket's effective range lies somewhere between 70 and 100 yards.|$|E

25|$|Ground {{was broken}} for two new express tracks between the West Fourth Street and 34th Street–Herald Square {{stations}} on April 19, 1961. The express tracks were built eighty feet beneath the surface. The construction {{was done in}} two portions. The first section was between West 9th and 19th Streets, and the second section was between West 19th and 31st Streets. The express tracks {{were part of a}} major subway improvement program that began with the reconstruction of the DeKalb Avenue station in Brooklyn. The second phase of construction, was the Chrystie Street Connection, which would connect the BMT lines coming over the Manhattan Bridge and the Williamsburg Bridge with the IND Houston Street Line. There was also to be a new two-track spur line between West 52nd and 58th Streets with a terminal at 57th Street. The two projects would increase the total number of trains <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> to Manhattan.|$|E

500|$|On 13 April 1943 the {{committee}} of the Chiefs of Staff met and agreed that they thought the plan should proceed. The committee informed Colonel John Bevan – the head of London Controlling Section, which controlled the planning and co-ordination of deception operations – {{that he needed to}} obtain final approval from Churchill. Two days later Bevan met the prime minister – who was in bed, wearing a dressing gown and smoking a cigar – in his rooms at the Cabinet War offices and explained the plan. He warned Churchill that there were several aspects <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> wrong, including that the Spaniards might pass the corpse back to the British, with the papers unread. Churchill replied that [...] "in that case we shall have to get the body back and give it another swim". Churchill gave his approval to the operation, but delegated the final confirmation to Eisenhower, the overall military commander in the Mediterranean, whose plan to invade Sicily would be affected. Bevan sent an encrypted telegram to Eisenhower's headquarters in Algeria requesting final confirmation, which was received on 17 April.|$|E
500|$|Glee {{choreographer}} Zach Woodlee described [...] "Proud Mary" [...] as the [...] "scariest" [...] number produced to date, citing {{concerns with}} choreographing an entire routine in wheelchairs and problems building the correct staging. Woodlee explained the stage ramps were initially built too steeply, preventing the actors from ascending them in wheelchairs, {{and that the}} actors experienced problems learning to distribute their weight correctly, flipping the wheelchairs over backwards: [...] "It was like roller derby. All of the actors would fall backwards and hit their heads—particularly Lea Michele. You lose your balance really quick {{when you try to}} go up a ramp in a wheelchair. Amber Riley caught an edge going down a ramp and fell off completely. There were pile-ups; there were crashes. Basically, everything <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> wrong, did." [...] Murphy specified to Woodlee that cast members should not be able to leave their wheelchairs during the number, as: [...] "Artie doesn't get to get up ever, so I didn't want anyone to get up." [...] Woodlee agreed: [...] "If it looked too fun and easy, it wouldn't read right. Ryan really wanted people to understand what Artie deals with." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{they had}} 23 baserunners in the game, 13 of whom they left on base, the Nationals’ season ended with {{elimination}} in the NLDS, as in their previous three postseason appearances, {{and it was}} the third time that they had played Game 5 of an NLDS at home and lost, the only MLB team other than the Oakland Athletics to lose more than one NLDS Game 5 loss at home over the previous decade. The Nationals became only the second team in MLB history to draw at least nine walks and score at least eight runs in a postseason game and still lose, the only previous team to do it having been the 1997 Cleveland Indians in the 1997 World Series. It was the eighth time the Nationals had played a one-run game in their postseason history, and they had lost all eight. It was the tenth time in a row that a team managed by Dusty Baker had lost a postseason game in which it had a chance to advance to the next round of the playoffs.

Northampton {{was a new}} ship {{with a number of}} innovations, including twin screws, searchlights and telephones, as well as being armed with torpedoes. It was fitted with an experimental Thompson-designed compass, which the inventor was on hand to adjust. Three days were spent attempting and failing to adjust the compass, with Thomson becoming increasingly bad tempered, until it was noticed that by accident the degree card had only been marked with 359 degrees instead of 360. The ship was fitted with a new design of lamp created by Captain Philip Colomb, who came on board to inspect them. As a joke, Fisher arranged for anything <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> wrong with the lamps to do so, sending Colomb away disheartened over his invention (although Fisher officially reported favourably about the lamps). On another occasion, the naval hospital at Halifax requested some flags to fly for the Queen's birthday. Fisher obliged, but sent only yellow and black flags signifying plague and quarantine. On the other hand, he worked hard at improving his ship. As reported by his second in command, Commander Wilmot Fawkes, the ship carried out 150 runs with torpedoes in a fortnight, whereas the whole rest of the navy only performed 200 in a year.|$|E
