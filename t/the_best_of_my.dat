After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you with all my heart and soul for what you have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E

500|$|In Europe in the 1990s, a {{successful}} driver would usually progress from Formula Three either directly to Formula One, {{the pinnacle of}} the sport, or to the International Formula 3000 championship. However, Hill {{did not have enough}} sponsorship available to fund a drive in F3000. He says [...] "I ended up having to reappraise my career a bit. The first thing was to realise how lucky I was to be driving anything. I made the decision that whatever I drove I would do it to <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> ability and see where it led." [...] He took a one-off drive in the lower level British F3000 championship and shared a Porsche 962 at Le Mans for Richard Lloyd Racing, where the engine failed after 228laps. He also competed in one race in the British Touring Car Championship at Donington Park, driving a Ford Sierra RS500. Midway through the season, an opportunity arose at the uncompetitive Mooncraft F3000 team. The team tested Hill and Perry McCarthy. Their performances were comparable but according to the team manager, John Wickham, the team sponsors preferred the Hill name. Although his best result was a 15th place, Hill's race performances for Mooncraft led to an offer to drive a Lola chassis for Middlebridge Racing in 1990. He took three pole positions and led five races in 1990, but did not win a race during his Formula 3000 career.|$|E

500|$|Priestley {{seems to}} have yearned for a more {{cosmopolitan}} community than Northumberland provided, writing to his sister that it was [...] "seemingly almost out of the world" [...] and complaining {{that he had to}} wait a week for news. He wrote to his friend John Vaughan: [...] "We know but little more than we did when we left you of European affairs." [...] In the winter of 1794–95, Priestley wrote to friends that his situation was very [...] "distant from my original views" [...] and [...] "my time here is far from passing so agreeably as it did in England", yet he was [...] "very thankful for such an asylum" [...] and he attempted [...] "to make <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> situation". In his letters to friends back in Britain, Priestley consistently referred to himself as an exile and to England as his real home. Mary was happier with the couple's situation and wrote to William Vaughan: [...] "I am happy and thankful to meet with so sweet a situation and so peaceful a retreat as the place I now write from. Dr. Priestley also likes it and of his own choice intends to settle here, which is more than I hoped for at the time we came up...This country is very delightful, the prospects of wood and water more beautiful than I have ever seen before and the people plain and decent in their manners." ...|$|E
