Rosecrans {{did not expect}} General Bragg to attack his force {{and did not know}} that Bragg had received 20,000 additional men and had two more divisions from Virginia due to arrive soon. Bragg planned to attack the scattered Union Army units and to retake Chattanooga after defeating them. On September 12, 1863, Rosecrans finally realized that Bragg was not continuing to retreat and apparently intended to fight. The regulars had been detached from their division, now commanded by Brigadier General Absalom Baird, and were still <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> on this date. Thomas and McCook had to bring their corps north toward Chattanooga in order to concentrate the scattered Union Army in one location. As the Union divisions moved along Chickamauga Creek, Rosecrans had Brigadier General Thomas Leonidas Crittenden's division move south to Lee & Gordon's Mill, along the Chickamauga, to support the movements of Thomas and McCook. On September 18, 1863, Bragg's Confederate force secured two bridges over the Chickamauga and prepared to attack Crittenden's position the next day. The same night, Rosecrans ordered Thomas to bring three divisions, including Baird's, north to Crittenden's position. The regulars arrived on the field about 6 miles from Chattanooga at sunrise on September 19, 1863.|$|E

Lou Groza added two field goals in the third quarter, and halfback Don Greenwood ran for a 41-yard touchdown to make the final score 20–6. Chicago's only points came on a touchdown run by Billy Hillenbrand on the first play of the fourth quarter.

2500|$|The {{idea behind}} [...] "Rhythm of Love" [...] is, {{according}} to Rabin, [...] "just sex". By {{the time of}} the recording, he felt Yes had pushed away from the cosmic-inspired lyrics that the group were known for in the 1970s with [...] "Owner of a Lonely Heart", and thought a sex lyric would be a [...] "nice little tease". Anderson claimed the group were strong for its chorus, but he felt unsure and needed the lyrics [...] "fashioned" [...] and changed some words. [...] "Big Generator" [...] is one of the album's three tracks credited to the whole group. It developed from a riff by Squire and Rabin, originating from a specific tuning Squire had on his 5-string bass which helped to create the song, which involved contributions from White on the drums. In its early development, White felt the song needed some [...] "Yes stamps" [...] incorporated into the arrangement, and instructed the group to play a section and not listen to his playing. [...] "I just stopped and started ... like the drummer fell off his stool and then got back on <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> the beat. Playing very slowly and then faster ... and then I was back in time". Once he was, [...] "I reversed the beat around backwards so I came in with the bass drum on two and four instead of one and three". [...] "Shoot High Aim Low", the second group track, was one of the songs recorded in Carimate, and features reverb that was captured naturally around the castle's acoustics, rather than reverb added electronically in the studio. White came up with the chords while he was playing in the studio with the drum box. When Rabin arrived at the studio, he told White to continue playing the beat while he started singing a melody that was used in the song. It features Anderson as [...] "the guy in the helicopter going in at ninety miles an hour and I'm going to blow everybody up", yet has Rabin's backing vocals sing a love lyric that involves a couple enjoying their company in a car. He summarised the song's message as [...] "To live beyond war". Rabin later called the song his favourite on Big Generator. Rabin called [...] "Almost Like Love" [...] a track that did not quite work in the end and wished it was not included on the album. He disagreed {{with the addition of a}} horn section, comparing it to soul music and [...] "Sussudio" [...] by Phil Collins. Squire was particularly into the song's riff, yet Rabin felt the song around it was substandard, like [...] "polishing a vase while the building was falling down".|$|E
