5|$|The 2012 {{date was}} also loosely {{tied to the}} long-running concept of the Photon Belt, which {{predicted}} a form of interaction between Earth and Alcyone, the largest star of <b>the</b> <b>Pleiades</b> cluster. Critics argued that photons cannot form belts, that <b>the</b> <b>Pleiades,</b> located more than 400 light years away, could {{have no effect on}} Earth, and that the Solar System, rather than getting closer to <b>the</b> <b>Pleiades,</b> was in fact moving farther away from it.|$|E
5|$|Galileo Galilei was {{the first}} {{astronomer}} to view <b>the</b> <b>Pleiades</b> through a telescope. He thereby discovered that the cluster contains many stars too dim {{to be seen with}} the naked eye. He published his observations, including a sketch of <b>the</b> <b>Pleiades</b> showing 36 stars, in his treatise Sidereus Nuncius in March 1610.|$|E
5|$|Charles Messier {{measured}} {{the position of}} the cluster and included it as M45 in his catalogue of comet-like objects, published in 1771. Along with the Orion Nebula and the Praesepe cluster, Messier's inclusion of <b>the</b> <b>Pleiades</b> has been noted as curious, as most of Messier's objects were much fainter and more easily confused with comets—something that seems scarcely possible for <b>the</b> <b>Pleiades.</b> One possibility is that Messier simply wanted to have a larger catalogue than his scientific rival Lacaille, whose 1755 catalogue contained 42 objects, and so he added some bright, well-known objects to boost his list.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Southern <b>Pleiades</b> (IC 2602) has a total {{apparent}} magnitude of 1.9, which is 70% fainter than <b>the</b> Taurean <b>Pleiades,</b> and contains about seventy-four stars. It is the third-brightest open cluster in the sky, following the Hyades. Like its northern counterpart, <b>the</b> Southern <b>Pleiades</b> spans a sizeable area of sky, approximately 50 arcminutes, {{so it is}} best viewed with large binoculars or telescope with a wide-angle eyepiece.|$|R

5|$|Edme-Sébastien Jeaurat {{then drew}} in 1782 {{a map of}} 64 stars of <b>the</b> <b>Pleiades</b> from his {{observations}} in 1779, which he published in 1786.|$|E
5|$|Measurements of the {{distance}} have elicited much controversy. Results prior to {{the launch of the}} Hipparcos satellite generally found that <b>the</b> <b>Pleiades</b> were about 135 parsecs away from Earth. Data from Hipparcos yielded a surprising result, namely a distance of only 118 parsecs by measuring the parallax of stars in the cluster—a technique that should yield the most direct and accurate results. Later work consistently argued that the Hipparcos distance measurement for <b>the</b> <b>Pleiades</b> was erroneous. In particular, distances derived to the cluster via the Hubble Space Telescope and infrared color-magnitude diagram fitting favor a distance between 135 and 140 pc; a dynamical distance from optical interferometric observations of the Pleiad double Atlas favors a distance of 133–137 pc. However, the author of the 2007–2009 catalog of revised Hipparcos parallaxes reasserted that {{the distance}} to <b>the</b> <b>Pleiades</b> is ~120 pc and challenged the dissenting evidence. Recently, Francis and Anderson proposed that a systematic effect on Hipparcos parallax errors for stars in clusters biases calculation using the weighted mean and gave a Hipparcos parallax distance of 126 pc and photometric distance 132 pc based on stars in the AB Doradus, Tucana-Horologium, and Beta Pictoris moving groups, which are all similar in age and composition to <b>the</b> <b>Pleiades.</b> Those authors note that the difference between these results can be attributed to random error.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pleiades</b> {{have long}} been {{known to be a}} {{physically}} related group of stars rather than any chance alignment. The Reverend John Michell calculated in 1767 that the probability of a chance alignment of so many bright stars was only 1 in 500,000, and so surmised that <b>the</b> <b>Pleiades</b> and many other clusters of stars must be physically related. When studies were first made of the stars' proper motions, it was found that they are all moving in the same direction across the sky, at the same rate, further demonstrating that they were related.|$|E

5|$|The {{distance}} to <b>the</b> <b>Pleiades</b> {{can be used}} as an important first step to calibrate the cosmic distance ladder. As the cluster is so close to the Earth, its distance is relatively easy to measure and has been estimated by many methods. Accurate knowledge of the distance allows astronomers to plot a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the cluster, which, when compared to those plotted for clusters whose distance is not known, allows their distances to be estimated. Other methods can then extend the distance scale from open clusters to galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and a cosmic distance ladder can be constructed. Ultimately astronomers' understanding of the age and future evolution of the universe is influenced by their knowledge of the {{distance to}} <b>the</b> <b>Pleiades.</b> Yet some authors argue that the controversy over the distance to <b>the</b> <b>Pleiades</b> discussed below is a red herring, since the cosmic distance ladder can (presently) rely on a suite of other nearby clusters where consensus exists regarding the distances as established by Hipparcos and independent means (e.g., the Hyades, Coma Berenices cluster, etc.).|$|E

5|$|Ages for star {{clusters}} {{can be estimated}} by comparing the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram for the cluster with theoretical models of stellar evolution. Using this technique, ages for <b>the</b> <b>Pleiades</b> of between 75 and 150 million years have been estimated. The wide spread in estimated ages {{is a result of}} uncertainties in stellar evolution models, which include factors such as convective overshoot, in which a convective zone within a star penetrates an otherwise non-convective zone, resulting in higher apparent ages.|$|E

5|$|The Quyllurit'i festival {{takes place}} {{at the end of a}} period of a few months when <b>the</b> <b>Pleiades</b> constellation, or Seven Sisters, a 7-star cluster in the Taurus constellation, disappears and reappears in the skies of the Southern Hemisphere.

5|$|The {{cluster is}} slowly {{moving in the}} {{direction}} of the feet of what is currently the constellation of Orion. Like most open clusters, <b>the</b> <b>Pleiades</b> will not stay gravitationally bound forever. Some component stars will be ejected after close encounters with other stars; others will be stripped by tidal gravitational fields. Calculations suggest that the cluster will take about 250 million years to disperse, with gravitational interactions with giant molecular clouds and the spiral arms of our galaxy also hastening its demise.|$|E

The Aranda people of Central Australia saw Corona Australis as a coolamon carrying a baby, which was accidentally dropped to earth {{by a group of}} sky-women dancing in the Milky Way. The impact of the coolamon created Gosses Bluff crater, 175km west of Alice Springs. The Torres Strait Islanders saw Corona Australis {{as part of a larger}} constellation encompassing part of Sagittarius and the tip of Scorpius's tail; <b>the</b> <b>Pleiades</b> and Orion were also associated. This constellation was Tagai's canoe, crewed by <b>the</b> <b>Pleiades,</b> called the Usiam, and Orion, called the Seg. The myth of Tagai says that he was in charge of this canoe, but his crewmen consumed all of the supplies onboard without asking permission. Enraged, Tagai bound the Usiam with a rope and tied them to the side of the boat, then threw them overboard. Scorpius's tail represents a suckerfish, while Eta Sagittarii and Theta Coronae Australis mark the bottom of the canoe. On the island of Futuna, the figure of Corona Australis was called Tanuma and in the Tuamotus, it was called Na Kaua-ki-Tonga.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} exist {{that are of}} interest to astronomers. Taurus hosts two of the nearest open clusters to Earth, <b>the</b> <b>Pleiades</b> and the Hyades, {{both of which are}} visible to the naked eye. At first magnitude, the red giant Aldebaran is the brightest star in the constellation. In the northwest part of Taurus is the supernova remnant Messier 1, more commonly known as the Crab Nebula. One of the closest regions of active star formation, the Taurus-Auriga complex, crosses into {{the northern part of the}} constellation. The variable star T Tauri is the prototype of a class of pre-main-sequence stars.|$|E
5|$|Another way of {{estimating}} {{the age of}} the cluster is by looking at the lowest-mass objects. In normal main-sequence stars, lithium is rapidly destroyed in nuclear fusion reactions. Brown dwarfs can retain their lithium, however. Due to lithium's very low ignition temperature of 2.5 × 106 K, the highest-mass brown dwarfs will burn it eventually, and so determining the highest mass of brown dwarfs still containing lithium in the cluster can give an idea of its age. Applying this technique to <b>the</b> <b>Pleiades</b> gives an age of about 115 million years.|$|E
5|$|In the {{northern}} part of the constellation to the northwest of <b>the</b> <b>Pleiades</b> lies the Crystal Ball Nebula, known by its catalogue designation of NGC 1514. This planetary nebula is of historical interest following its discovery by German-born English astronomer William Herschel in 1790. Prior to that time, astronomers had assumed that nebulae were simply unresolved groups of stars. However, Herschel could clearly resolve a star at the center of the nebula that was surrounded by a nebulous cloud of some type. In 1864, English astronomer William Huggins used the spectrum of this nebula to deduce that the nebula is a luminous gas, rather than stars.|$|E
