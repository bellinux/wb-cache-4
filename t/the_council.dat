5|$|After Dorgon's {{death on}} the last day of 1650, the Shunzhi Emperor started his {{personal}} rule: he ordered the members of <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> to memorialize to him directly on important matters of state. After Dorgon's supporters had been purged from the court (by March 1651), his former co-regent Jirgalang made a number of special appointments to <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> to foster loyalty among the Manchu elite. Between 1651 and 1653, he added thirty new members who lacked official positions in the Banners or the metropolitan bureaucracy. Two of the new appointees were Chinese Bannermen Fan Wencheng 范文程 (1597–1666) and Ning Wanwo 寗完我 (d. 1665), two of only three Chinese who were ever appointed to <b>the</b> <b>Council.</b> All four of the future regents for the Kangxi Emperor (Oboi, Suksaha, Ebilun, and Soni) were also appointed to <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> at that time. In 1656, the emperor issued an edict abolishing the automatic appointment to <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> of Manchu and Mongol Grand Secretaries, yet by the end of his reign in 1661, <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> still counted more than fifty members. During the Shunzhi reign, <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> was often convened to investigate important officials who had been accused of corruption or malfeasance.|$|E
5|$|All new {{subsidiary}} legislation must {{be sent to}} <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> for scrutiny within 14 days of their publication in the Government Gazette. <b>The</b> <b>Council</b> is then required to make its report to the Speaker and the appropriate Minister within 30 days. However, unlike with bills, there is no provision to extend the original deadline. As with bills, tardiness in sending an adverse report results in a conclusive presumption that <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> finds no differentiating measures in the {{subsidiary legislation}}. Where <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> issues an adverse report, the Minister must revoke or amend the offending provision within {{six months of the}} report, unless Parliament passes a resolution confirming that provision.|$|E

5|$|Cuthbert {{presided over}} <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> of Clovesho in 747 along with Æthelbald of Mercia.

It also mandated that each diocese hold a synod to proclaim the decisions of <b>the</b> <b>council.</b> Cuthbert sent his deacon Cynebert to Pope Gregory III after <b>the</b> <b>council</b> with a report on <b>the</b> <b>council</b> and its resolutions. This action may have been taken in response to Boniface's complaints about Cuthbert and Æthelbald to the papacy.

5|$|If <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> {{does make}} an adverse report, Parliament may amend {{the bill to}} rid it of any {{differentiating}} measures before sending it back to <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> for inspection.
