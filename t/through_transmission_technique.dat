Liquid {{as well as}} plastic limit are two commonly used Atterberg limits and are used extensively, either individually or together, with other soil properties to correlate with engineering behavior such as compressibility, compactibility, shrink-swell and shear strength.

40|$|Over {{the past}} quarter century, {{a wide variety of}} {{ultrasonic}} techniques have been developed to determine the phase velocity and thickness of elastic plates. Techniques to measure the phase velocity include toneburst [1 – 4], separable pulse methods [5 – 7], and spectroscopy [8 – 11]. These classical methods require that the specimen be thick enough such that two successive echoes from the front and the back faces of the specimen, respectively, be separable in the time domain. Kinra and Dayal [12], developed a <b>through</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>technique</b> which removes this particular limitation of the classical methods. This technique works satisfactorily for the measurement of the phase velocity for specimens whose thickness is greater than one-half of the wavelength; for thinner specimens, however, their numerical algorithm runs into convergence problems. Moreover, their numerical algorithm cannot be used to determine thickness at any wavelength. The reasons for their convergence problems are discussed in detail by Iyer, Hanneman and Kinra [13]. They demonstrated that a detailed sensitivity analysis is a necessary pre-requisite {{for the development of a}} robust inversion algorithm. Accordingly, a new inversion scheme based on the method of least squares was developed by Iyer and Kinra to determine thickness from the measurements of phase, magnitude and complex spectrum, respectively, [14 – 17]. In all of the above ultrasonic methods only one parameter can be determined i. e., an accurate knowledge of thickness is required to determine the wavespeed and vice versa. This defines the central objective of the present work: In this paper we present a technique for determining, simultaneously, the thickness and wavespeed of a thin layer...|$|E

Design/methodology/approach: An EMAT (Electro Magnetic Acoustic Transducer) has been designed and fabricated with an elongated spiral coil and a permanent magnetic core.

40|$|Fracture in rock is a {{major factor}} that affects the rock's {{physical}} properties and it also provides the route for the passage of fluids that can transport potentially hazardous substances and hydrothermal fluids. Assessment of the degree of fracture in rocks is important as they play an essential role in many geomechanical issues (stability of boreholes, stimulation of oil and geothermal reservoirs, the design of civil structures, tunnels and hazardous waste disposals), and in understanding a number of processes in the Earth's crust such as magmatic intrusions, plate tectonics, fault mechanics and sedimentary basins. The fundamental understanding of how seismic waves are altered when they pass through fractured rock are currently poorly understood, hence a comprehensive study is timely. An improved understanding of how fractures affect the physical properties (such as seismic velocity and attenuation) would significantly enhance our ability to predict the fracture state of rock at depth remotely. The main focus of this thesis is to characterize P and S wave velocity, their ratio, shear wave splitting and attenuation and their dependence on the fracture density of the rock. Laboratory experiments were carried out in uniaxial compressive condition to increase microfracture density and hydrostatic confining condition to close microfractures. Experiments were performed on a single rock type (Westerly granite) to keep the mineralogy, chemical composition, and grain size constant. The condition of the microfractures was dry to remove the complexity of saturation and fluid type. <b>Through</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>technique</b> was used to measure P and S wave velocities and spectral ratio technique was used to measure attenuation. P and S wave velocities were measured at 1. 5 MHz. Attenuation measurements were made in the frequency range of O. 8 MHz to 1. 7 MHz. Elastic properties can be measured statically where strain data are recorded and related to stress during slow loading of a specimen, or dynamically, where the elasticity can be calculated from the velocity of P and S waves. In order to understand the elastic properties of the crust at depth using seismology, the relationship between the static and dynamic properties must be known. Increasing-amplitude, uniaxial cyclic loading experiments were carried out to investigate and quantify the effect of microcracking on the elastic properties, and to establish a relationship between static and dynamic measurements. There is a linear relationship between static and dynamic Young's moduli, and a significant discrepancy between the static and dynamic Poisson's ratio. We attribute the differences in the static and dynamic elastic properties to the size distribution of the crack population relative to the amplitude and frequency of the applied stress, frictional sliding on closed cracks during loading/unloading, and the assumption of isotropic elasticity in the sample. Strong stress-dependency exists in the uniaxial compressive and hydrostatic confining conditions due to closure of microcracks. This resulted in: an increase in the P and S wave velocities, their ratio, static and dynamic Young's modulus, and static and dynamic Poisson's ratio; and a decrease in the P and S wave attenuation. The increase of fracture density caused: a decrease in the P and S wave velocities and static and dynamic Young's modulus; a small increase in the dynamic Poisson's ratio and VpNs; and a large increase in the static Poisson's ratio, and P and S wave attenuation. Seismic wave attenuation is more sensitive than seismic wave velocity to closure of microcracks and Increase of microfracture density. The effect of varying crack density on the P and S wave velocities and elastic properties under confining pressure (depth) were quantified. The elastic wave velocities and Young's modulus of samples that have a greater amount of microcrack damage required higher confining pressure to be equal to those of samples with no induced microcrack damage. We found that fractures are completely closed at ~ 5 km (~ 130 MPa) in crystalline rocks. At shallow depth (less than 5 km), fracture density affects seismic wave velocities. We observed an overall 6 % and 4 % reduction in P and S wave velocities respectively due to an increase in the fracture density. The overall reduction in the P and S wave decreased to 2 % and 1 % at ~ 2 km. Consequently, assessing the degree of fracture between 2 km and 5 km using seismic wave velocities may be difficultEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Die Ultraschallprüfung als klassisches Verfahren der zerstörungsfreien Prüfung findet zunehmend auch im Bauwesen Anwendung. Der dafür anwendbare Frequenzbereich ist aufgrund von Streuungen an den Gesteinskörnern und Luftporen auf etwa 200 kHz begrenzt. Da man aus praktischen Gründen auf kleine Prüfkopfgrößen beschränkt ist, führen die niedrigen Prüffrequenzen zu einem für die Ultraschallprüfung ungünstig kleinen Verhältnis des Prüfkopfdurchmessers zur Wellenlänge. Die Folge ist ein fast ungerichtetes Abstrahlungsverhalten für Longitudinalwellen. Außerdem kommt es zusätzlich zu einer erheblichen Abstrahlung von Transversal- und Oberflächenwellen, die eine Ultraschallprüfung mit der Impuls-Echo-Methode erschweren. Um das Abstrahlungsverhalten zu verbessern, kann man mehrere Prüfköpfe zu Strahlergruppen zusammenschalten oder mit geringerem Aufwand an Gerätetechnik und Prüfköpfen nach dem Prinzip der synthetischen Apertur entsprechende Strahlergruppen durch sequentielle Abtastung einer „Apertur“-Fläche mit einem Prüfkopf nachbilden. Im Rahmen der Arbeit werden Konzepte für den Einsatz der Ultraschallprüfung mit Strahlergruppen an Betonbauteilen vorgestellt und der Einfluss der Betoneigenschaften auf die Ultraschallausbreitung bei der Anwendung dieser Techniken untersucht. Um den Einfluss der Schwingerform und -größe der Prüfköpfe auf das Schallfeld theoretisch zu untersuchen, wurde ein Rechenprogramm auf Grundlage der Punktquellensynthese entwickelt, das bei der Berechnung die Annahme beliebiger Schwingergeometrien und -anordnungen zulässt. Für die experimentellen Untersuchungen wurde ein laufzeitgesteuerter Gruppenstrahler für den Niederfrequenzbereich, bestehend aus zehn einzelnen Prüfköpfen, aufgebaut, mit dem das Schallbündel im Betonbauteil geschwenkt und/oder fokussiert werden kann. Um die Ausbildung der Schallfelder des zeitlich gesteuerten Gruppenstrahlers und deren Steuerbarkeit unter den Bedingungen des inhomogenen Werkstoffes Beton auch experimentell zu überprüfen, wurden zunächst sowohl Schallfeldprofile als auch Schallschnelleverteilungen im Schallbündelquerschnitt mit und ohne Fokussierung des Schallbündels gemessen. Die Messungen erfolgten an Betontestkörpern mit 8 mm und 16 mm Größtkorn mittels eines scannenden Laservibrometers in Durchschallung. Eine besonders anschauliche Methode, die Funktionsweise des Gruppenstrahlers zu demonstrieren, ist die Visualisierung der Wellenausbreitung. Dabei wird das Schallfeld an einer Schnittfläche des Schallbündels, die möglichst {{parallel}} und nahe zur Bündelachse liegt, abgetastet. Hierzu kann die Seitenfläche eines Testblockes dienen, auf die das Schallbündel fast streifend auftrifft. Mit Hilfe eines entsprechenden Auswerteverfahrens kann die Schallwellenausbreitung dargestellt werden. Als Ergebnis liegt ein Konzept zur Anwendung der Gruppenstrahlertechnik auch für Ultraschalluntersuchungen an Betonbauteilen vor. Durch die gegebenen Möglichkeiten einer elektronischen Schallfeldsteuerung erhält man Abbildungen des Prüfobjektinneren für die verbesserte Fehlerdetektion und -interpretation, die bisher nur mit einem aufwändigen mechanischen Abtastsystem und mit nachträglicher Rekonstruktionsrechnung möglich waren. Da der Sendebetrieb des Gruppenstrahlers die Steuerung realer Schallfelder gestattet, kann man deren Ausbildung im Beton überprüfen, was die Vorbereitung von Prüfungen sehr vereinfacht und die Zuverlässigkeitsbeurteilung verbessert. Ultrasonic {{testing is}} a classical non-destructive testing method, which is increasingly applied in civil engineering. For ultrasonic testing at concrete the frequency range {{is restricted to}} frequencies below 200 kHz. This range {{is determined by the}} materials aggregate size, which causes sound scattering. For practical reasons probes with small dimensions (and diameters) are used for the measurements but the low frequencies lead to a disadvantageous small ratio between the diameter of the probe and the wavelength of the signals. As a consequence the radiation of the longitudinal waves is almost non-directional. Additionally a significant emission of transversal and surface waves is taking place, an effect, which interferes with the ultrasonic echo testing. To improve the radiation performance, several probes can be arranged and operated in arrays of transducer elements. Another possibility is to carry out measurements with a single probe, which scans the surface area sequentially following the principle of synthetic aperture technique. In the frame of this work concepts are introduced for the application of ultrasonic testing with phased arrays (time-controlled transducer) at concrete elements. The influence of concrete properties (air-pores and concrete aggregate size) on the wave propagation has been investigated for this technique. For theoretical investigation of the influence of shape and dimension of the transducer on the sound field software has been developed, which is based on point source synthesis. This program enables calculations taking into account any geometry and set up of the transducers. For the experimental investigations a low frequency ultrasonic phased array consisting of ten single probes has been set up, allowing the deflection and focussing of the sound beam within the test specimen during the measurement. Therefore it is possible to check the formation and controllability of the sound fields even under the conditions and restrictions of the inhomogeneous material concrete. To achieve this, sound field profiles as well as the distribution of sound particle velocity are measured in the transverse section of the sound beam with and without focusing it. The measurements were carried out at concrete test specimen (8 mm and 16 mm maximum aggregate size) using a scanning laser-vibrometer in <b>through</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>technique.</b> A particularly demonstrative method to show the functionality of the phased array is the visualization of the wave propagation by scanning the sound field at an intersecting plane of the sound beam. The intersection has to be located close to and preferably parallel to the acoustic axis. This can be the lateral surface of a test block, which is hit by the sound beam in grazing direction. With a suitable analysis procedure adapted to the measurement instrumentation the sound wave propagation can be displayed. A concept for the application of the phased array technique for ultrasonic testing of concrete elements is available. The electronic control of the sound beam provides the possibility of imaging the inner structure of the test object. This leads to improved failure detection and interpretation, something that was until now only possible using complex mechanical scanning systems and subsequent reconstruction calculations. The controllability of real sound fields through the phased array allows the supervision of the sound field development in concrete elements. This facilitates the preparation of investigations and enhances the reliability assessment of the investigations...|$|E

40|$|Ergodic {{capacity}} {{is an important}} performance measure associated with reliable communication at the highest rate at which information can be sent over the channel with a negligible probability of error. In the shadow of this definition, diversity receivers (such as selection combining, equal-gain combining and maximal-ratio combining) and <b>transmission</b> <b>techniques</b> (such as cascaded fading channels, amplify-and-forward multihop transmission) are deployed in mitigating various performance impairing effects such as fading and shadowing in digital radio communication links. However, the exact analysis of ergodic {{capacity is}} in general not always possible {{for all of these}} forms of diversity receivers and <b>transmission</b> <b>techniques</b> over generalized composite fading environments due to it's mathematical intractability. In the literature, published papers concerning the exact analysis of ergodic capacity have been therefore scarce (i. e., only [1] and [2]) when compared to those concerning the exact analysis of average symbol error probability. In addition, they are essentially targeting to the ergodic capacity of the maximal ratio combining diversity receivers and are not readily applicable to the capacity analysis of the other diversity combiners / <b>transmission</b> <b>techniques.</b> In this paper, we propose a novel moment generating function-based approach for the exact ergodic capacity analysis of both diversity receivers and <b>transmission</b> <b>techniques</b> over generalized composite fading environments. As such, we demonstrate how to simultaneously treat the ergodic capacity analysis of all forms of both diversity receivers and multihop <b>transmission</b> <b>techniques.</b> © 2012 IEEE...|$|R
