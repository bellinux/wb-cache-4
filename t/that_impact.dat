5|$|Distance {{from the}} sea is another {{important}} geographic factor. Owing {{to the shape of}} the country, the close proximity to the ocean means that most of the country, excluding the north is moderated by the surrounding oceans, leading to lower thermal amplitudes than comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere. The two main currents <b>that</b> <b>impact</b> the climate of Argentina are the Brazil Current from the north and the Malvinas Current from the south (a branch of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current). The Brazil Current transports warm subtropical waters southwards while the Malvinas Current transports cold, subantarctic waters northwards. The Malvinas Current cools the coastal areas, particularly during winter when the current is more stronger. Thus, coastal areas of the Pampas have cooler summers and a longer frost period owing to the cold Malvinas Current. As well, it is the main factor in making Tierra del Fuego colder than at comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere in Europe since it is influenced by the cold Malvinas Current rather than the warm North Atlantic Current.|$|E
5|$|Some {{parts of}} the game require timed {{responses}} from players, often leading to significant decisions <b>that</b> <b>impact</b> the game's story. Some conversation trees require players to select a response within a limited time, otherwise Reza remains silent. The game also requires action choices, wherein players must {{decide what to do}} in specific circumstances; for example, one sequences tasks players with choosing whether to take aggression during a protest, or to take photographs. Other characters will respond to the decisions accordingly, and a notification feature indicates that a character will remember the selected response. In action-based sequences, players follow on-screen prompts for quick time events in order to stay alive. Should players fail to follow the prompts in the allocated time, the game restarts from prior to the quick time event.|$|E
5|$|The calcium {{sensitivity}} of the sarcomere, that is, the calcium concentration at which muscle contraction occurs, is directly determined by the calcium binding affinity of cNTnC. To date, there are no known post-translational modifications of cTnC <b>that</b> <b>impact</b> its calcium binding affinity. However, calcium binding by cNTnC is a dynamic process that can be impacted by the closed-to-open conformational equilibrium of cNTnC, the domain positioning of cNTnC, or the relative availability of cTnI148-159, the physiologic binding partner of cNTnC. The closed-to-open equilibrium of cNTnC can be shifted towards the open state by small compounds (see section below on troponin-binding drugs). Domain positioning of cNTnC can be impacted by phosphorylation of cTnI, of which the most important site in humans is Ser22/Ser23. The availability of cTnI148-159 depends on the blocked-closed-open equilibrium of tropomyosin on actin, which can be impacted by any interactions involving the thin filament, including actin-myosin cross-bridging and length dependent activation (also known as stretch activation or the Frank Starling law of the heart). All of these processes can be impacted by mutations (see section below on disease-causing mutations).|$|E

5|$|The country became {{independent}} in 1977. Fédération Djiboutienne de Football {{was founded in}} 1977 and joined FIFA in 1994. Football {{is one of the}} most popular sports in the country. Women's football development in Africa has to deal with several challenges <b>that</b> <b>impact</b> the ability to develop a high level of play, including limited access to education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. When high level women's players are developed, many leave the country seeking greater opportunity in Northern Europe or the United States. Another issue facing women's football in Africa is that most of the money for the game does not come from national football federations but instead from FIFA.|$|E
5|$|This region's land is {{appropriate}} for agricultural and livestock activities. It is mostly a flat area, interrupted only by the Tandilia and Ventana hills in its southern portion. The climate of the Pampas is temperate and humid with no dry season, featuring hot summers and mild winters (Cfa/Cfb according to the Köppen climate classification). The weather in the Pampas is variable due to the contrasting air masses and frontal storms <b>that</b> <b>impact</b> the region. Maritime polar air from the south produces the cool pampero winds, while warm humid tropical air from the north produces sultry nortes - a gentle wind usually from the northeast formed by trade winds, and the South Atlantic High that brings cloudy, hot, and humid weather and is responsible for bringing heat waves. The Pampas {{are influenced by the}} El Niño–Southern Oscillation which is responsible for variations in annual precipitation. An El Niño year often leads to higher precipitation, while a La Niña year leads to lower precipitation. The Pampas are moderately sunny, ranging from an average of 4–5 hours of sunshine per day during the winter months to 8–9 hours in summer.|$|E
