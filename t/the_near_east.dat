5|$|Piye made various {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts to}} extend Egyptian influence in <b>the</b> <b>Near</b> <b>East,</b> then controlled by Assyria. In 720BC, he sent an army {{in support of}} a rebellion against Assyria, which was taking place in Philistia and Gaza. However, Piye was defeated by Sargon II and the rebellion failed. In 711BC, Piye again supported a revolt against Assyria by the Israelites of Ashdod and was once again defeated by the Assyrian king Sargon II. Subsequently, Piye was forced from <b>the</b> <b>Near</b> <b>East.</b>|$|E

5000|$|British {{archaeologist}} D.G. Hogarth published <b>The</b> <b>Nearer</b> <b>East</b> in 1902, {{in which}} he stated his view of [...] "The <b>Near</b> East": [...] <b>The</b> <b>Nearer</b> <b>East</b> is a term of current fashion for a region which our grandfathers were content to call simply The East. Its area is generally understood to coincide with those classic lands, historically the most interesting {{on the surface of}} the globe, which lie about the eastern basin of the Mediterranean Sea; but few probably could say offhand where should be the limits and why. Hogarth then proceeds to say where and why in some detail, but no more mention is made of the classics. His analysis is geopolitical. His map delineates <b>the</b> <b>Nearer</b> <b>East</b> with regular lines as though surveyed. They include Iran, the Balkans, but not the Danube lands, Egypt, but not the rest of North Africa. Except for the Balkans, the region matches the later Middle East. It differs from the Ottoman Empire of the times in including Greece and Iran. Hogarth gives no evidence of being familiar with the contemporaneous initial concept of the Middle East.|$|R

5|$|A mermaid is {{a legendary}} aquatic {{creature}} {{with the head}} and upper body of a female human and {{the tail of a}} fish. Mermaids appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide, including <b>the</b> <b>Near</b> <b>East,</b> Europe, Africa and Asia. The first stories appeared in ancient Assyria, in which the goddess Atargatis transformed herself into a mermaid out of shame for accidentally killing her human lover. Mermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, shipwrecks and drownings. In other folk traditions (or sometimes within the same tradition), they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons or falling in love with humans.|$|E

5|$|From {{the early}} 14th century BC, Mycenaean trade {{began to take}} {{advantage}} of the new trading opportunities in the Mediterranean after the Minoan collapse. The trade routes were expanded further reaching Cyprus, Amman in <b>the</b> <b>Near</b> <b>East,</b> Apulia in Italy and Spain. At that time (c. 1400 BC), the palace of Knossos yielded the earliest records of the Greek Linear B script, based on the previous Linear A of the Minoans. The use of the new script spread in mainland Greece and offers valuable insight of the administrative network of the palatial centers. However, the unearthed records are too fragmentary for a political reconstruction of Bronze Age Greece.|$|E

5|$|Gedi's {{participation}} in maritime trade {{can be seen}} in the increasing frequency of imports found at Gedi over the course of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Conditions along the Atlantic coast prevented European nations from opening sea lanes until the early-sixteenth century, limiting maritime trade to states with easy access to the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. Many artifacts found at Gedi including much of the ceramics, all the beads, and the two Chinese coins resulted from either direct or indirect trade with <b>the</b> <b>Near</b> <b>East,</b> Arabia, China, India, and Indochina. Swahili coastal settlements exported gold, ivory, slaves, ebony, mangrove poles, copper, copal gum, frankincense, myrrh, and crystal rock.|$|E
