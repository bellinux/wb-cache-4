25|$|South of the {{platform}} is a small set of goods sidings which currently store the TPOs, mineral wagons and other stock when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> use.|$|E
50|$|Electoral {{observers}} {{said the}} election <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a failure, even though <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> full praise.|$|R
50|$|U.S. {{stations}} often retransmitted NASA TV while <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> use, {{especially when}} there were Space Shuttle missions.|$|R
50|$|The only {{prominent}} musical {{organization to}} <b>not</b> <b>be</b> {{affected by the}} strike was the Boston Symphony Orchestra, as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the union.|$|R
25|$|These {{divisions}} of the images seem perfectly congruous, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not.</b> <b>In</b> the year the cold of winter takes up {{one quarter of the}} row; in the day, night takes up one half of the row; in the final row, however, death begins the moment the tree is chopped down into logs.|$|E
25|$|Blue phase mode LCDs {{have been}} shown as {{engineering}} samples early in 2008, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> mass-production. The physics of blue phase mode LCDs suggest that very short switching times (~1 ms) can be achieved, so time sequential color control can possibly be realized and expensive color filters would be obsolete.|$|E
25|$|Some cranks claim vast {{knowledge}} of any relevant literature, while others claim that familiarity with previous work is entirely unnecessary; regardless, cranks inevitably reveal that {{whether or not}} they believe themselves to be knowledgeable concerning relevant matters of fact, mainstream opinion, or previous work, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not,</b> <b>in</b> fact, well-informed concerning the topic of their belief.|$|E

25|$|The City Corporation of London remains lord {{of three}} manors at Southwark (Guildable, King's and Great Liberty). These are {{membership}} organisations for those areas {{which are the}} jurors of their manorial courts. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> any way Guilds as {{are not related to}} trading and occupational activities. These courts retain legal-standing under the Administration of Justice Act 1977.|$|E
25|$|Jeremiah's prophecies {{are noted}} for the {{frequent}} repetitions found in {{them of the}} same words, phrases, and imagery. They cover the period of about 30 years. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> chronological order. Modern scholars do not believe they have reliable theories as to when, where, and how the text was edited into its present form.|$|E
25|$|Although both {{species of}} {{jellyfish}} {{living in the}} lake have stinging cells (nematocytes), <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> general powerful enough to cause harm to humans. It {{has been reported that}} it is possible to notice the stings on sensitive areas like the area around the mouth. The Fish 'n Fins tour guide recommended that people with allergies to jellyfish consider wearing protective clothing.|$|E
50|$|According to a {{pre-production}} Hollywood Reporter news item, James Arness, Ralph Meeker, James Whitmore, William Campbell, and Richard Anderson, <b>were</b> cast, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the film.|$|R
50|$|In combat <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{considered}} ferocious {{and were}} {{reputed to be}} experts with flintlock weapons (invented in 1615), but these were so unreliable that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> widespread military use before the 1670s.|$|R
30|$|Na+/Ca 2 + ratios {{were several}} times higher in Gampaha control area {{compared}} to CKDu endemic area samples; however, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the range identified by Chandrajith et al. (2011) in earlier research.|$|R
25|$|Flexible OLED {{displays}} {{are already}} being produced and these are used by manufacturers to create curved displays such as the Galaxy S7 Edge but so far there <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> devices that can be flexed by the consumer. Apart from the screen itself the circuit boards and batteries {{would need to be}} flexible. Samsung demonstrated a roll-out display in 2016.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological remains {{exist for}} only one type of limb armour: bronze greaves, which {{protected}} the lower leg. Greaves could be worn by both heavy infantry and heavy cavalry, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> great evidence in contemporary depictions. However, greaves are mentioned in the Military Decree of Amphipolis {{and a pair of}} greaves, one shorter than the other, were found in the Vergina Tomb.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} predatory copepods exist {{throughout}} the Delta, about which relatively little is known. Sinocalanus doerri, Acartiella sinensis, and Tortanus dextrilobatus all {{appear to be}} morphologically capable of predation upon other copepods. Each {{was introduced to the}} estuary, probably through ballast water exchange since the 1980s. Generally, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> sufficient abundance to negatively impact copepod consumers; however, periodic blooms of S. doerri and A. sinensis occur which have not been well studied.|$|E
50|$|This section lists some {{widely used}} {{obsolete}} elements, which means <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> used <b>in</b> valid code. <b>They</b> may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> supported <b>in</b> all user agents.|$|R
50|$|After the First World War, {{only eight}} {{locomotives}} {{went to the}} Deutsche Reichsbahn, who allocated them the numbers 38 101 to 38 108; however, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> active service, and were scrapped in 1924.|$|R
50|$|In Namangan, Elena {{provided}} {{for her family}} by working as a Washerwoman, cleaning homes and scrubbing floors. When <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> school, little Grisha and his older sister Zhenya helped their mother out with her work.|$|R
25|$|Like all Latrodectus species, L. tredecimguttatus has {{a painful}} bite that is fatal in rare cases. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> close {{association}} with humans generally, although epidemics of bites have been reported. There are many reports of Ukrainian farm workers receiving bites {{while working in}} the fields. The LD-50 of L. tredecimguttatus venom has been measured as 0.59mg/kg, and separately again as 0.59mg/kg (with a confidence interval of 0.33–1.06).|$|E
25|$|When {{intermediates}} lay eggs, {{their eggs}} are often eaten by the egg laying wasp herself. This {{is known as}} oophagy. This may occur because this practice increases energy circulation. These wasps {{may not be able}} to store protein well, so they consume their own eggs, reintroducing the protein into their bodies. This supports the idea that queens do in fact control reproduction in the colonies. Intermediates know <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> charge, so they consume their own eggs.|$|E
25|$|In superhero fiction, {{eyeglasses}} {{have become}} a standard component of various heroes' disguises (as masks), allowing them to adopt a nondescript demeanor when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> their superhero persona: Superman {{is well known for}} wearing 1950s style horn-rimmed glasses as Clark Kent, while Wonder Woman wears either round, Harold Lloyd style glasses or 1970s style bug-eye glasses as Diana Prince. An example of the halo effect is seen in the stereotype that those who wear glasses are intelligent.|$|E
50|$|However, it {{also caused}} {{problems}} for the Germans, as it sometimes detected stray radar emissions from distant ships or planes, causing U-boats to submerge when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> actual danger, preventing them from recharging batteries or using their surfaced speed.|$|R
50|$|He has {{translated}} the Brihaddeshi of Matanga Muni, Chaturdandi Prakasika of Pandit Venkatamakhi and Dattilam of Dattila Muni into Telugu language and published it. He was also translated {{some of the}} music theory books but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> print.|$|R
50|$|Civilian {{officials}} who made representations {{to the commission}} indicated that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> a position, under the circumstances of conflict, to carry out any assessment of civilian casualties. Consequently, no estimated or verified figures of civilian casualties {{are available in the}} report.|$|R
25|$|Since {{there is}} a pin joint at A, it will have 2 {{reaction}} forces. One in the x direction {{and the other in}} the y direction. At point B, we have a roller joint and hence we only have 1 reaction force in the y direction. Let us assume these forces to be in their respective positive directions (if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the positive directions like we have assumed, then we will get a negative value for them).|$|E
25|$|Non-equilibrium {{thermodynamics}} is {{a branch}} of thermodynamics that deals with systems {{that are not in}} thermodynamic equilibrium. Most systems found in nature are not in thermodynamic equilibrium because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> stationary states, and are continuously and discontinuously subject to flux of matter and energy to and from other systems. The thermodynamic study of non-equilibrium systems requires more general concepts than are dealt with by equilibrium thermodynamics. Many natural systems still today remain beyond the scope of currently known macroscopic thermodynamic methods.|$|E
25|$|The {{courts have}} largely {{abandoned}} the Lochner era approach (ca. 1897–1937), when substantive due process {{was used to}} strike down minimum wage and labor laws to protect freedom of contract. Since then, the Supreme Court has decided that numerous other freedoms, even if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> {{the text of the}} Constitution, are protected by it. If they were not protected by the federal courts' doctrine of substantive due process, they could nevertheless be protected in other ways; for example, some rights are protected by other provisions of the state or federal constitutions or by legislatures.|$|E
50|$|In 1960, in {{a letter}} to those engaged in education, the general had to confront those who doubted whether the colleges were a {{ministry}} proper to the Society or who asserted that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> conformity with the spirit of St. Ignatius.|$|R
50|$|A foreign navy vessel {{opened fire}} on a pirate {{mothership}} near Puntland resulting in it sinking and killing one of the pirates on board and injuring at least three others. U.S and European forces state <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the area at the time.|$|R
