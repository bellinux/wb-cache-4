50|$|The human {{development}} model is one {{which can be}} used to describe how <b>totipotent</b> <b>cells</b> arise. Human development begins when a sperm fertilizes an egg and the resulting fertilized egg creates a single totipotent cell, a zygote. In the first hours after fertilization, this zygote divides into identical <b>totipotent</b> <b>cells,</b> which can later develop into any of the three germ layers of a human (endoderm, mesoderm, or ectoderm), into cells of the cytotrophoblast layer or syncytiotrophoblast layer of the placenta. After reaching a 16-cell stage, the <b>totipotent</b> <b>cells</b> of the morula differentiate into cells that will eventually become either the blastocyst's Inner cell mass or the outer trophoblasts. Approximately four days after fertilization and after several cycles of cell division, these <b>totipotent</b> <b>cells</b> begin to specialize. The inner cell mass, the source of embryonic stem cells, becomes pluripotent.|$|E
25|$|Most {{distinct}} cell types {{arise from}} a single <b>totipotent</b> <b>cell,</b> called a zygote, that differentiates into hundreds of different cell types {{during the course of}} development.

40|$|The {{importance}} of epigenetic mechanisms is most clearly illustrated during early development when a <b>totipotent</b> <b>cell</b> goes through multiple cell fate transitions {{to form the}} many different cell types and tissues that constitute the embryo and the adult.

Here, we discuss recent data on macroH 2 A in zebrafish and mouse embryos, in embryonic and adult stem cells and also in nuclear reprogramming.

50|$|All higher {{multicellular}} organisms contain cells specialised {{for different}} functions.

Differentiation of cells is driven by different environmental cues (such as cell-cell interaction) and intrinsic differences (such as those caused by the uneven distribution of molecules during division). Multicellular organisms are composed of cells that fall into two fundamental types: germ cells and somatic cells. During development, somatic cells will become more specialized and form the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. After formation of the three germ layers, cells will continue to specialize until they reach a terminally differentiated state that is much more resistant to changes in cell type than its progenitors.|$|R

50|$|Plant {{stem cells}} are {{characterized}} by two distinctive properties, which are: {{the ability to create}} all differentiated cell types and the ability to self-renew such that the number of stem cells is maintained. Plant stem cells never undergo aging process but immortally give rise to new specialized and unspecialized cells, and they have the potential to grow into any organ, tissue, or cell in the body. Thus they are <b>totipotent</b> <b>cells</b> equipped with regenerative powers that facilitate plant growth and production of new organs throughout lifetime.|$|E
50|$|The pluriblast is a {{pluripotent}} {{population of}} {{cells in the}} embryogenesis of marsupials, called the inner cell mass in eutherians. The pluriblast is distinct from the trophoblast, and {{gives rise to the}} germ layers of the embryo, as well as extra embryonic endoderm and extra embryonic mesoderm. Both the pluriblast and trophoblast arise from the <b>totipotent</b> <b>cells</b> of the early conceptus. By definition, the pluriblast does not give rise to trophoblast cells during normal development, although it may retain this potential under experimental conditions.|$|E

40|$|<b>Totipotent</b> stem <b>cells</b> {{have the}} {{potential}} to differentiate into every cell type. Renewal of <b>totipotent</b> stem <b>cells</b> in the germline and cellular differentiation during early embryogenesis rely upon posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms.

MEX- 3 is a maternally-supplied factor that controls the RNA metabolism of transcripts encoding critical cell fate determinants. However, the nucleotide sequence specificity and requirements of MEX- 3 mRNA recognition remain unclear. Only a few candidate regulatory targets have been identified, and the full extent of the network of MEX- 3 targets is not known. Here, we define the consensus sequence required for MEX- 3 RNA recognition and demonstrate that this element is required for MEX- 3 dependent regulation of gene expression in live worms. Based on this work, we identify several candidate MEX- 3 targets that help explain its dual role in regulating germline stem cell totipotency and embryonic cell fate specification...|$|R

50|$|Previously, human eggs {{had only}} been {{produced}} in vitro from totipotent, blastomeric embryonic stem cells. This experiment demonstrated viable human egg cells can easily be produced from an adult cell that already has some degree of specialization. Furthermore, it lessens the implications associated {{with the fact that}} women are born with all of the egg cells they will ever have throughout their lives. While this breakthrough was not without controversy, it provides hope for infertile women wishing to undergo in vitro fertilization, and hints at the possibility of new options for postmenopausal women, as well. It also suggests the future of stem cell research may not have to rely as heavily on human embryos as a source of unspecialized, <b>totipotent</b> <b>cells</b> for research.|$|E
50|$|Expression {{patterns}} of many miRNAs are timing and organ specific, especially {{those involved in}} the regulation of development. miRNA libraries constructed from cloning and sequencing short RNAs derived from cultures of mouse embryonic stem cells have shown miR-92 to be expressed. These <b>totipotent</b> <b>cells</b> represent the earliest stages of mammalian development (they are derived from the inner cells of the blastocyst). However, mir-92 was also present in libraries constructed from four-day-old fully differentiated cells, as well as libraries constructed from adult tissues. An miRNA that remains constant in its expression through these stages is proposed to have a role in regulating general aspects of cell physiology. Thus it was becoming evident in 2003 shortly after its discovery, that the mir-92 miRNA and associated family members are providing functional roles to the cell cycle and to cell signalling, and to general cell physiology.|$|E

40|$|The {{successful}} implantation of the blastocyst {{depends on}} adequate {{interactions between the}} embryo and the uterus. The development of the embryo begins with the fertilized ovum, a single <b>totipotent</b> <b>cell</b> which undergoes mitosis and {{gives rise to a}} multicellular structure named blastocyst. At the same time, increasing concentrations of ovarian steroid hormones initiate a complex signaling cascade that stimulates the differentiation of endometrial stromal cells to decidual cells, preparing the uterus to lodge the embryo. Studies in humans and in other mammals have shown that cytokines and growth factors are produced by the pre-implantation embryo and cells of the reproductive tract; however, the interactions between these factors that converge for successful implantation are not well understood. This review focuses on the actions of interleukin- 1, leukemia inhibitory factor, epidermal growth factor, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor, and on the network of their interactions leading to early embryo development, peri-implantatory endometrial changes, embryo implantation and trophoblast differentiation.
