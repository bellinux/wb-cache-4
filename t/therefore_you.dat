25|$|As stated before, DESI {{allows for}} a direct {{investigation}} of natural samples without needing any sample preparation or chromatographic separation. But, because of this unneeded sample prep the spectrum created maybe very complex. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>you</b> can couple an Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance to DESI, allowing for a higher resolution. The DESI can be composed of six linear moving stages and one rotating stage. This can include a 3-D linear stage for samples and another with the rotating stage for the spray mount. Coupling of an FTICR to DESI can increase mass accuracy to below 3 parts per million. This can be done on both liquid and solid samples.|$|E
500|$|The bombing came {{five days}} after the {{beginning}} of the peace talks in Belfast, and represented the IRA's opposition to talks which excluded republicans. The attack was part of a political strategy by the IRA to be included in negotiations on the IRA's own terms. According to historian Richard English: [...] "What they were doing with their return to bombings like the Manchester bomb was saying, 'We can still return to war if we want to. We can still put off a huge bomb in your cities and devastate them and <b>therefore</b> <b>you</b> have to deal with us'".|$|E

Maeda and Satake were the top graduated professors at Waseda University, both sandan (3rd dan), along with Matsuhiro Ritaro (nidan or 2nd dan) and six other shodan (1st dan). Kyuzo Mifune registered at the Kodokan in 1903 and {{attracted the attention of}} Maeda, who commented, [...] "you are strong and competent, <b>therefore,</b> <b>you</b> will certainly leave your mark in the Kodokan ..." [...] Mifune went to learn under Sakujiro Yokoyama and later, already a celebrated judoka, Mifune said that Maeda's words were a great incentive, as he regarded Maeda with the greatest admiration, even though Yokoyama was his sensei (instructor).|$|E
500|$|In late 1898 Karim's {{purchase}} of a parcel of land adjacent to his earlier grant was finalised; {{he had become a}} wealthy man. Reid claimed in his diary that he had challenged Karim over his financial dealings: [...] "You have told the Queen that in India no receipts are given for money, and <b>therefore</b> <b>you</b> ought not to give any to Sir F Edwards [...] This is a lie and means that you wish to cheat the Queen." [...] The Munshi told the Queen he would provide receipts in answer to the allegations, and Victoria wrote to Reid dismissing the accusations, calling them [...] "shameful".|$|E

500|$|The Union {{supply ship}} Eugene was fired at by Confederate rebels on the Mississippi River {{at the second}} Chickasaw Bluff, while {{carrying}} supplies to Memphis in September 1862. Major General Sherman ordered Colonel Charles C. Walcutt of the 46th Ohio Infantry to Randolph. He informed his subordinate officer that [...] "the attack on the Eugene was by a small force of guerrillas from Loosahatchie, who by this time have gone back, and <b>therefore</b> <b>you</b> will find no one at Randolph" [...] (emphasis in the original). Although he could not locate the snipers, Sherman was determined to punish those who helped them, thus sealing the fate of Randolph. Sherman instructed Walcutt to [...] "destroy the place, leaving one house to mark the place". Union Army soldiers under Colonel Walcutt's command burned Randolph {{in retaliation for the}} guerrilla activities emerging from the area. To his superior officer, Major General Ulysses S. Grant, Sherman reported that he had [...] "given public notice that a repetition [...] will justify any measures of retaliation, such as loading the boats with guerrilla prisoners where they would receive fire". In 1869, Ulysses S. Grant (1822–85) would become the 18th President of the United States and William T. Sherman would become commanding General of the United States Army.|$|E

Your Lithuania along with the other Baltic nations, including Finland, will have to join the glorious family of the Soviet Union. <b>Therefore</b> <b>you</b> should begin now to initiate your people into the Soviet system, which in the future shall reign everywhere, throughout all Europe; put into practice earlier in some places, as in the Baltic nations, later in others." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), God told Moses {{that he and}} Aaron should take the rod and order the rock to yield its water. Moses took the rod, {{assembled}} the congregation {{in front of the}} rock, and said to them: [...] "Listen, you rebels, shall we get water for you out of this rock?" [...] Then Moses struck the rock twice with his rod, out came water, and the community and their animals drank. But God told Moses and Aaron: [...] "Because you did not trust Me enough to affirm My sanctity in the sight of the Israelite people, <b>therefore</b> <b>you</b> shall not lead this congregation into the land that I have given them." [...] The water was named Meribah, meaning quarrel or contention." ...|$|E
2500|$|For example, {{a recipe}} is a process, and not copyrightable, {{but the words}} used to {{describe}} it are; see idea-expression divide and Publications International v Meredith Corp. (1996). <b>Therefore,</b> <b>you</b> can rewrite a recipe {{in your own words}} and publish it without infringing copyrights. But, if you rewrote every recipe from a particular cookbook, you might still be found to have infringed the author's copyright in the choice of recipes and their [...] "coordination" [...] and [...] "presentation", even if you used different words; however, the West decisions below suggest that this is unlikely unless there is some significant creativity carried over from the original presentation. [...] It should be noted that a sufficiently novel, useful, and unique (i.e. non-obvious) recipe can be granted protection under patent law.|$|E

2500|$|Altman favored stories {{expressing the}} interrelationships among several characters, being more {{interested}} in character motivation than in intricate plots. He therefore tended to sketch out only a basic plot for the film, referring to the screenplay as a [...] "blueprint" [...] for action. By encouraging his actors to improvise dialogue, Altman thus became known as an [...] "actor's director," [...] a reputation that attracted many notable actors to work {{as part of his}} large casts. Performers enjoy working with Altman in part because [...] "he provides them with the freedom to develop their characters and often alter the script through improvisation and collaboration," [...] notes Derry. Richard Baskin says that [...] "Bob was rather extraordinary in his way of letting people do what they did. He trusted you to do what you did and <b>therefore</b> <b>you</b> would kill for him." ...|$|E
2500|$|The only {{case that}} has the proper base {{diameter}} and rim diameter is the [...]425 Wesley Richards, which runs about $4 a piece. Any other brass {{will not have the}} proper rim size, either too large or too small. In a pinch, you could form [...]458 SOCOM from [...]50 BeowulfTM but the rim would be smaller. The initial prototype brass bore the [...]50AE head stamp and this has caused some confusion. The SOCOM case is 1.575" [...] long, the [...]50AE is 1.290" [...] so <b>therefore,</b> <b>you</b> CANNOT form the SOCOM case from the AE case. The case length was chosen to be compatible with the Barnes 300-grain X Spitzer bullet. In 2009, Barnes developed a new bullet specifically for use in the [...]458 SOCOM, the 300 grain Tipped Triple Shock X, also known as the TTSX or TAC-X.|$|E
2500|$|Although her {{service was}} marred by her nervousness, and taxed her health, Jane Ely quickly {{became one of the}} Queen's most trusted attendants. The Queen {{referred}} to Jane as “almost one of ourselves”, which indicates the difference that Victoria liked to maintain between herself and non-royals. Jane became the most prominent of ladies that were recognised “agents” of the Queen, the others being Harriet Phipps and Horatia Stopford. The role was exploited, especially in the royal household, where they found in Jane a useful advocate to the Queen when requesting approval for a course of action. The use of Jane as an unofficial secretary was widely acknowledged in society, and references to her are found in many letters from the aristocracy. When the Earl of Beaconsfield fell out with the Queen after he refused to meet Lord Chelmsford, he wrote despairingly to Jane, with the probable intention that she would show it to the Queen, that “I love the Queen — perhaps the only person in this world left to me that I do love; and <b>therefore</b> <b>you</b> can understand how much it worries and disquiets me, when there is a cloud between us.” ...|$|E
