5|$|The second floor, {{reserved}} as {{the chamber}} for the Senate, was more ornate and adorned with heavy red drapes. By 1796, the room featured 32 secretary desks {{very similar to}} <b>the</b> <b>desks</b> that are still used in the current Senate chamber in the United States Capitol; 28 of <b>the</b> <b>desks</b> at Congress Hall are original. Portraits of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, presented as gifts from the French monarch following the American Revolution, hang in adjoining committee rooms. A fresco of an American bald eagle is painted on the ceiling, holding the traditional olive branch to symbolize peace. Also on the ceiling, a plaster medallion {{in the form of}} a sunburst features 13 stars to represent the original colonies. The design mirrors a similar pattern on the floor, where a carpet made by William Sprague, a local weaver, features the shields of each of the 13 original states. The carpet seen today is a reproduction of the original.|$|E
5|$|The {{trading area}} is {{surrounded}} by desks allowing workers to support transactions. In the early days, <b>the</b> <b>desks</b> served as a relay point between the pits and those wishing to buy or sell. When trade orders and information began to be communicated by telegraph, Morse code operators were employed, later replaced by phone operators. In the late 20th century, electric display boards lined {{the walls of the}} trading hall and the advent of electronic trading resulted in computers being placed on desktops.|$|E
5|$|Michael sneaks {{back into}} the office, {{crawling}} on the floor below <b>the</b> <b>desks</b> so Charles, who {{is sitting in the}} conference room, will not notice him. Michael grabs his customer list and makes a final desperate offer for the other employees to join him. Charles notices Michael and physically threatens him, prompting Michael to leave without the customer list. After Charles angrily closes the conference room door, Pam follows Michael out of the building, announcing that she is leaving with him. However, she tells Michael she wants to be a salesperson at his new company, not a receptionist. Michael agrees, then asks Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) if he wants to come with them, but he declines. Pam and Michael leave together, feeling both exhilarated and apprehensive.|$|E

2500|$|The second {{modification}} {{was done}} to raise <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> by adding a separate, uniform base called a plinth. [...] The first time a base was made for <b>the</b> Resolute <b>Desk</b> was during <b>the</b> John F. Kennedy Administration. [...] This base was made of pine and did not match <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> very well. [...] That base is very visible in the famous photo of John F. Kennedy Jr. playing under <b>the</b> Resolute <b>Desk.</b> In January 1977, President Carter requested <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> {{be sent back to}} the White House from the Smithsonian Institution. [...] Photos from January–February 1977 show <b>the</b> Resolute <b>Desk</b> being used with a base, but the base had been removed by late May of that year, when it was photographed without it. White House record photos from early in Ronald Reagan's presidency, one as late as October 23, 1981, show <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> being used without a base. President Reagan requested that <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> be raised higher since he was hitting his legs {{on the top of the}} knee hole. The White House's earliest image of <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> with a base during the Reagan Administration is dated August 13, 1982. A new, better-fitting base was built for <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> in 1986, and that base has remained with <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> since that time.|$|R

The site and grounds are maintained by the Ridgefield Garden Club. The building is open certain Sundays and displays <b>the</b> <b>desks,</b> slates and books the children used.|$|E

'Lincoln's Last Interview', written and directed by Emmy nominee Brent Roske, was performed in the House of Representatives chamber with the audience seated at <b>the</b> <b>desks.</b> Iowa news host Elizabeth Klinge played a reporter interviewing Abraham and Mary Lincoln, played by Matthew McIver and Mary Bricker.|$|E
25|$|Each senator {{chooses a}} desk based on {{seniority}} within the party. By custom, {{the leader of}} each party sits {{in the front row}} along the center aisle. Forty-eight of <b>the</b> <b>desks</b> date back to 1819, when the Senate chamber was reconstructed after the original contents were destroyed in the 1812 Burning of Washington. Further desks of similar design were added as new states entered the Union. It is a tradition that each senator who uses a desk inscribes their name {{on the inside of the}} desk's drawer.|$|E

50|$|Like <b>the</b> rolltop <b>desk,</b> {{which was}} invented much later, <b>the</b> {{cylinder}} <b>desk</b> usually has a fixed work surface: the paperwork {{does not have}} to be stored before <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> is shut. Some designs, however, have the capacity to slide <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> surface out a few inches to expand the available work area.|$|R
25|$|The {{premises}} {{were still}} located at No. 21 London Road and the Jubilee Institute. As the tenancy {{of the private}} venture school was to end on 25 March 1896, the Town Council paid Mr Cruikshank £10 for <b>the</b> <b>desks,</b> books and goodwill of his school. Boys were drawn from three elementary schools in Chippenham: the British, National and St. Paul's Schools. In addition twelve boys had previously attended the private grammar school. Others were from other private schools in Chippenham, Corsham, Devizes, Calne and surrounding villages. There were 39 boys aged 11 to 16 on the admission register from 13 April 1896. The curriculum included Latin, French, science, history, geography, grammar, bookkeeping, shorthand, arithmetic, writing, geometry and freehand drawing.|$|E
500|$|Twyne studied manuscripts at the Bodleian Library, {{founded by}} Thomas Bodley in 1602. Thomas Twyne, his father, gave books to the library. When Bodley died in 1613, Twyne {{was one of}} the {{contributors}} to a volume of verse commemorating him: he wrote eight poems in Latin and one in Greek, and recalled a comment by King James I that Bodley ought to be called [...] "Sir Thomas Godley". However, Twyne was displeased with the work of Thomas James, the first Bodley's Librarian, complaining to the library authorities in November 1613 about missing manuscripts, inaccurate records and delays in accessing new acquisitions, and about the librarian's poor attendance and his habit of scattering his papers around <b>the</b> <b>desks.</b> James was admonished for his conduct.|$|E
500|$|Jim {{contributes}} {{several hundred}} dollars to the party-planning fund in order to buy fireworks, later revealing that he has decided to propose to Pam, going back to their [...] "first date". Pam notices the purchase and guesses his intentions; however, at the party, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) ruins the moment by proposing to Angela, who bitterly accepts. Pam is visibly disappointed that Jim didn't propose to her. Michael has security escort Toby {{out of the office}} as a parting insult. Dwight is crushed that his ex-girlfriend is marrying someone else. In the last scene of the episode, Phyllis returns to the office, pleased at the success of her party, where she and the camera crew walk in on Angela and Dwight having sex on one of <b>the</b> <b>desks.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Wilson <b>desk</b> is a {{double-pedestal desk}} built of mahogany. Its {{workspace}} is 58 1/4 inches by 80 3/4 inches {{and it is}} 31 inches high. It has drawers in both pedestals, and the knee-hole extends {{all the way through}} <b>the</b> <b>desk.</b> During its time in the White House a glass top was used on top of <b>the</b> <b>desk.</b> This sheet of glass covered the whole workspace of <b>the</b> <b>desk.</b>|$|R

500|$|The debating chamber {{contains}} a shallow elliptical horseshoe of seating for the MSPs, with the governing party or parties {{sitting in the}} middle of the semicircle and opposition parties on either side, similar to other European legislatures. Such a layout is intended to blur political divisions and principally reflects the desire to encourage consensus amongst elected members. This is in contrast to the [...] "adversarial" [...] layout reminiscent of other Westminster style national legislatures, including the House of Commons, where government and opposition sit apart and facing one another. There are 131 desks and chairs on the floor of the chamber for all the elected members of the Scottish Parliament and members of the Scottish Government. <b>The</b> <b>desks</b> are constructed out of oak and sycamore and are fitted with a lectern, a microphone and in-built speakers as well as the electronic voting equipment used by MSPs. Galleries above the main floor can accommodate a total of 255 members of the public, 18 guests and 34 members of the press.|$|E
500|$|Swift's friend, Anderson, portrayed {{herself in}} the video. The love {{interests}} of both Swift and Anderson were cast by Swift after she received images of them via e-mail. The video was filmed in two days. The first day consisted of actors, including Swift and Anderson, filming before a green screen. On the set, White presented Swift with caricature drawings depicting the music video, in order to guide herself. Swift was impressed by Anderson's acting skills, considering her lack of experience, and called it [...] "prolific". On the second day, scenes {{at a high school}} were filmed; artificial rain was made. Afterward, White and a team of visual effect artists created the setting. [...] "If you watch just the offline edit of this video, it's just green. It's just Taylor walking around a giant green screen. And to think that every single thing in that video was created is amazing, 'cause a lot of people worked really hard on it", White said. The visual effects team were at work for the video for some time, sometimes staying overnight in the office to produce the video. The direction was to make the video seem [...] "magical". Some of the props used when filming were recreated using digital animation, such as the door and <b>the</b> <b>desks.</b> Because extras were filmed separately, White was meticulous to find the right shots to make the scene more cohesive. White believed the finished product had a sense of innocence.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fact that}} the writers {{identified}} themselves only as [...] "The Seekers of Truth and Justice", without a place of publication or copyright notice, only added to the mystery. Over three days, 1600 copies were handed out—800 in Khartoum, 500 {{in other parts of}} Sudan (except the South) and 300 abroad.

2500|$|A node may be {{the child}} of another node; in such a case, it becomes logical that {{multiple}} steps {{must be taken to}} carry out an attack. [...] For example, consider classroom computers which are secured to <b>the</b> <b>desks.</b> [...] To steal one, the securing cable must be cut or the lock unlocked. [...] The lock may be unlocked by picking or by obtaining the key. [...] The key may be obtained by threatening a key holder, bribing a keyholder, or taking it from where it is stored (e.g. under a mousemat). [...] Thus a four level attack tree can be drawn, of which one path is (Bribe Keyholder,Obtain Key,Unlock Lock,Steal Computer).|$|E
