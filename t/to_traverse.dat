5|$|The Rose–Baley Party was {{the first}} European American {{emigrant}} wagon train <b>to</b> <b>traverse</b> the 35th parallel route known as Beale's Wagon Road, established by Edward Fitzgerald Beale, from Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico to the Colorado River near present-day Needles, California.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} asset are the Storm's narrow dimensions, {{which allow}} it <b>to</b> <b>traverse</b> the narrow alleyways {{common to the}} casbahs of many Middle Eastern cities, places that armoured Humvees can only enter with great difficulty and minimal manoeuvrability, if at all. Full-height rear doors which allow for the quick deployment of fully equipped troops into combat are touted as another advantage over similar vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Capesize {{ships are}} too large <b>to</b> <b>{{traverse}}</b> the Panama canal and must round Cape Horn to travel between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Earlier, capesize ships could not traverse the Suez {{and needed to}} go around the Cape of Good Hope. Recent deepening of the Suez canal to 66ft (20m) permits most capesize ships to pass through it.|$|E
30|$|Both surveys (GPR and ER) {{reflect that}} certain {{traverses}} (1, 2, 3 and 5) at depths of about 5  m reflect high hydraulic conductivity values while others (traverses 4, 6, 7 and 8) reflect moderate to low hydraulic conductivity values. The traverses with high hydraulic conductivities correspond <b>to</b> <b>traverses</b> with low resistivities (with pores, cracks being water-filled) {{which makes them}} liable to groundwater seepage events. The traverses with moderate and low hydraulic conductivities correspond <b>to</b> <b>traverses</b> with high resistivities and less liable to groundwater seepages.|$|R

5|$|Connections to San Francisco's local {{light rail}} system, the Muni Metro, are {{facilitated}} primarily through the twin-level Market Street subway. Plans from 1960 called for BART trains <b>to</b> <b>traverse</b> the Twin Peaks Tunnel, but {{the upper level}} of the subway {{was turned over to}} Muni and both agencies share the Embarcadero, Montgomery, Powell and Civic Center stations. Some Muni Metro lines connect with (or pass nearby) the BART system at the Balboa Park and Glen Park stations.|$|E
5|$|During the Nimrod Expedition led by Ernest Shackleton in 1907, parties led by Edgeworth David {{became the}} first to climb Mount Erebus and to reach the South Magnetic Pole. Douglas Mawson, who assumed the {{leadership}} of the Magnetic Pole party on their perilous return, went on to lead several expeditions until retiring in 1931. In addition, Shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in December 1908– February 1909: they were the first humans <b>to</b> <b>traverse</b> the Ross Ice Shelf, the first <b>to</b> <b>traverse</b> the Transantarctic Mountains (via the Beardmore Glacier), and the first to set foot on the South Polar Plateau. An expedition led by Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen from the ship Fram {{became the first}} to reach the geographic South Pole on 14 December 1911, using a route from the Bay of Whales and up the Axel Heiberg Glacier. One month later, the doomed Scott Expedition reached the pole.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Atari Inc. {{released}} {{their version}} of Namco's hit arcade game Pac-Man for its Atari 2600 video game console. Like the original arcade version, the player controls the title character with a joystick. The object is <b>to</b> <b>traverse</b> a maze, consuming all the wafers within while avoiding four ghosts.|$|E
50|$|The formula {{features}} division by two because {{usually the}} instrumentation emits and records the ultrasound wave {{on the same}} side of the sample using the fact that it is reflected on the boundary of the element. Thus, the time corresponds <b>to</b> <b>traversing</b> the sample twice.|$|R

5|$|In {{order to}} regain the upper hand, he planned to launch a {{surprise}} assault on the Austrian army stationed in the Cisalpine Republic. Based on the assumption the Austrians would never expect Napoleon's large force to be able <b>to</b> <b>traverse</b> the Alps, he chose that as his route. He selected the shortest route through the Alps, the Great St Bernard Pass, which would enable him to reach his destination as quickly as possible.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of its journey, the trail follows the ridge line of the Appalachian Mountains, {{crossing}} many of its highest peaks, and running, {{with only a few}} exceptions, almost continuously through wilderness. The trail used <b>to</b> <b>traverse</b> many hundreds of miles of private property; currently 99% of the trail is on public land.|$|E
5|$|Moonlight Madness is a {{video game}} for the ZX Spectrum home computer, {{published}} in 1986 by Bubble Bus Software. It is an arcade adventure game in which players control a boy scout. The object {{of the game is}} to unlock a safe within a mansion to obtain pills for the mansion's owner, a mad scientist, who has collapsed. This requires the player <b>to</b> <b>traverse</b> the mansion's rooms while avoiding hazards such as dangerous house servants and fatal falls.|$|E

Above , aircraft would be allowed <b>to</b> <b>traverse</b> the corridor under the handling of air traffic control.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{military}} sent a plane carrying {{doctors and}} food from Patrick Air Force Base to Mayaguana in the Bahamas. Crews {{of doctors and}} workers with food and supplies left from Key West and Miami <b>to</b> <b>traverse</b> the Florida Keys, bringing aid to affected residents. In Marathon, a large reconstruction program rehabilitated the key by Christmas.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} {{escalators}} and two stairs {{from the main}} entrance to the upper mezzanine. Past the main entrance's fare control, which is split into two banks, there are two parallel shafts down to the lower mezzanine; the northern shaft carries four escalators, while the southern shaft carries one escalator and the two incline elevators. The lowermost five escalators are the system's longest and take about one minute and thirty seconds <b>to</b> <b>traverse.</b>|$|E
50|$|FireWire {{devices are}} {{organized}} {{at the bus}} in a tree topology. Each device has a unique self-ID. One of the nodes is elected root node and always has the highest ID. The self-IDs are assigned during the self-ID process, which happens after each bus resets. The order in which the self-IDs are assigned is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>traversing</b> the tree depth-first, post-order.|$|R

5|$|Traditionally in {{adventure}} game engines, non-player {{characters were}} static awaiting the player {{to interact with}} them to trigger an event. However, Virtual Theatre allowed non-player characters <b>to</b> <b>traverse</b> the world in seemingly random patterns, interacting with their environment. Upon the engine's first release, it rivaled competing engines such as LucasArts' SCUMM engine, and Sierra's Creative Interpreter, due to its then high level of artificial intelligence.|$|E
5|$|When Harriman State Park {{opened in}} 1910, the Monroe–Haverstraw highway was renamed Southfields Road. Three years later, {{a portion of}} the route became part of Seven Lakes Drive, a major highway built <b>to</b> <b>traverse</b> the park. In 1916, Rockland County {{numbered}} its highways for the first time. The Rockland County section of the former Monroe and Haverstraw Road was designated as CR416 at this time. From 1919 to 1920, the highway was reconstructed and rebuilt to state standards.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing the}} {{connection}} to the Lincoln Highway, officials convinced planners of the Victory Highway <b>to</b> <b>traverse</b> the state. The highway entered Colorado from Kansas along what was previously called the Smoky Hill Trail. The highway crossed the mountains along a trail blazed by a railroad surveyor and captain in the American Civil War, cresting at Berthoud Pass. After a round of political infighting between Utah and Nevada, the Victory Highway would become the Lincoln Highway's main rival for San Francisco-bound traffic. When the U.S. Highway system was unveiled in 1926, the Victory Highway was numbered U.S. Highway 40.|$|E

5|$|At times, some ox cart trains {{did not go}} all the way through, {{but were}} {{supplemented}} by river craft. First flatboats and then shallow-draft steamboats ascended the Minnesota River <b>to</b> <b>Traverse</b> des Sioux and upstream points, where they were met by cart brigades travelling the West Plains Trail. In 1851, weekly steamboat service on the Mississippi began between Saint Anthony Falls and Sauk Rapids on the Middle and Woods trails. In 1859, steamboat machinery was carried overland to the Red River where a boat was built, but service was intermittent. The Dakota War of 1862 and the American Civil War delayed further improvements.|$|E
5|$|Before the Mexican–American War, {{when this}} area was ceded to the United States, the main trade route through this part of Mexico was the Old Spanish Trail. This trail {{extended}} from Santa Fe, New Mexico to Los Angeles. The trail had multiple routes; however, the main route proceeded north towards Moab, Utah, {{one of the few}} places where the Colorado River can be crossed without having <b>to</b> <b>traverse</b> steep cliffs. The modern US491 roughly correlates with the main route of the Old Spanish Trail between Cortez, Colorado and its northern terminus.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the Upper Ottawa Street crossing, {{residential}} {{developments are}} confined to {{the north side of}} the Linc as it curves southward, descending towards the top of the Red Hill Valley. Surrounded by undeveloped land, it meets the northern end of Dartnall Road at a trumpet interchange, with Mt. Albion Conservation Area to the southeast and the Red Hill Creek passing beneath the interchange <b>to</b> <b>traverse</b> the Niagara Escarpment at Albion Falls. The Linc gradually curves back northeast, now surrounded, passing under Pritchard Road. Immediately east of there, the Mud Street interchange branches off as the route curves northward and becomes the Red Hill Valley Parkway, which descends the escarpment towards the QEW.|$|E
