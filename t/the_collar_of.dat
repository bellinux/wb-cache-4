5|$|The {{platform}} {{between the}} implant and the abutment can be flat (buttress) or conical fit. In conical fit abutments, <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> the abutment sits inside the implant which allows a stronger junction between implant and abutment {{and a better}} seal against bacteria into the implant body. To improve the gingival seal around the abutment collar, a narrowed collar on the abutment is used, referred to as platform switching. The combination of conical fits and platform switching gives marginally better long term periodontal conditions compared to flat-top abutments.|$|E

25|$|Two covers {{were created}} for The Fame Monster, {{both of which}} were shot by French {{photographer}} Hedi Slimane. In the artwork of the standard edition, Gaga is seen sporting a blond wig and a sleek, angular black coat, <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> which covers the lower half of her face. The image of the deluxe version sees the singer draped in thick brown hair, her face embellished with heavy, streamy black eyeliner. At first Gaga had a dispute with her record label over the artwork; Interscope found the brunette cover to be too dark and gothic for a mainstream release. However, Gaga explained to them that both would be suitable with the yin and yang concept of the album and ultimately they agreed. The font used on the cover is the sans-serif letterform used by Christian Dior in their campaigns.|$|E

The Scottish unicorn and English lion hold lances flying the banners of St Andrew and St George, in imitation of the two unicorns in the original arms.

25|$|News {{spread quickly}} among the Italian courts, and Guy de Brimeu, {{counselor}} of the Duke of Burgundy, was particularly surprised about the developing {{news of the}} marriage. Ferdinand knew that the wedding plans were fluctuating and subject to political uncertainties and questions, and this was even more true elsewhere like in the Court of Burgundy. He confided in his son with two major tasks: the first was to give to Charles the Bold <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> the Order of the Ermine he had created, and welcome him to the Order of the Knights of the Fleece or, the second was to replace, in the entourage of Charles, Nicola di Monforte Pietravalle, Count of Campobasso, a former vassal of Ferdinand who served René of Anjou and had ties to John of Calabria, who recruited mercenaries in Piedmont, Lombardy and Emilia {{to serve in the}} army of Burgundy.|$|E
25|$|There were 15 guests (at Poutrincourt's table), {{each of whom}} in his turn, became steward and caterer of the day. At the dinner, the steward, with napkin on shoulder, {{staff of}} office in hand, and <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> the order round his neck, led the van. The other guests in {{procession}} followed, each bearing a dish. After grace in the evening, he resigned the insignia to his successor, and they drank {{to each other in}} a cup of wine. It was the steward's duty, to look to supplies, and he would go hunt or fish a day or two before his turn came, and add some dainty to the ordinary fare. During the winter they had fowl and game in abundance, supplied by the Indians and by their own exertions. These feasts were often attended by Indians of all ages and both sexes, sometimes twenty or thirty being present. The Sagamore, or chief, Membertou, the greatest Sagamore of the land, and other chiefs, when there, were treated as guests and equals.|$|E
