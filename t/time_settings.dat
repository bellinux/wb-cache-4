2500|$|The Book of Daniel {{is divided}} between the court tales of {{chapters}} 1–6 and the apocalyptic visions of 7–12, and between the Hebrew of chapters 1 and 8–12, and the Aramaic of chapters 2–7. This language division {{is reinforced by the}} chiastic arrangement of the Aramaic chapters (see below). Various suggestions have been made by scholars to explain the fact that the genre division does not coincide with the other two. However, the most reasonable proposal is that put forward by John J. Collins: the language division and concentric structure of chapters 2-6 are artificial literary devices designed to bind the two halves of the book together. It {{should also be noted that}} the <b>time</b> <b>settings</b> of chapters 1–6 show a progression from Babylonian to Median times, which is repeated (Babylonian to Persian) in chapters 7–12. The following outline is provided by Collins in his commentary on Daniel: ...|$|E

This makes the interval perform akin to weighted least squares intervals. The accuracy of the approach is demonstrated in three common regression problems. A noteworthy by-product of the work identifies explicit variances of several classical regression statistics in <b>time</b> series <b>settings...</b>|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{models of}} {{overcurrent}} (OC) with inverse time relay characteristics {{play an important}} role for the coordination of power system protection schemes. This paper proposes a new method for modelling OC relays curves. The model is based on fuzzy logic and artificial neural network. The feedforward multilayer perceptron neural network is used to calculate the operating times of OC relays for various <b>time</b> dial <b>settings</b> (TDS) or <b>time</b> multiplier <b>settings</b> (TMS). The new model is more accurate than traditional models. The model has been validated by comparing the results obtained from the new method with linear and nonlinear analytical models...|$|R

50|$|The Cage reminds its {{adolescent}} {{readers that}} the past must never be forgotten, and that intolerance and discrimination are harmful and must be replaced by cultural understanding {{and the promotion of}} personal differences. However, there are many lapses in the <b>time</b> <b>settings</b> of this book, and because the plot moves quickly, it leaves the author's day-to-day description of events undeveloped in places.|$|E
50|$|Manual Exposure: Full manual {{exposure}} is possible using the jog buttons.

Specifically the first game is played so that each player has 100 minutes for 40 moves and then 30 minutes, always adding 30 seconds per move. In case of a draw, the <b>time</b> <b>settings</b> are changed to 25 minutes, adding 10 seconds per move. In case of another draw, the players will continue to play blitz chess, 10 minutes per player, adding 5 seconds per move.|$|E
50|$|The Mamiya ZM, {{introduced}} in 1982, was essentially an advanced {{version of the}} ZE-2, {{with some of the}} features of the ZE-X. It was the last Mamiya 135-film camera produced. It had an aperture-priority automatic time control, based on center-weighted TTL readings, an automatic shutter-speed range from 4 seconds to 1/1000, and a manual range from 2 seconds to 1/1000. Visual and audio signals indicated over- or under-exposure, pending battery failure, or excessive camera shake. Metering modes, shutter release, self-timer, manual <b>time</b> <b>settings</b> and the ergonomics of the camera body were also improved.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The idea to use {{simulations}} (or refinements) as a compositional abstraction {{device is}} well-known, both in untimed and <b>timed</b> <b>settings,</b> {{and has already}} been studied theoretically and practically in many papers {{during the last three}} decades. Nevertheless, existing approaches do not handle two fundamental modeling concepts which, for instance, are frequently used in the popular Uppaal model checker: (1) a parallel composition operator that supports communication via shared variables as well as synchronization of actions, and (2) committed locations. We describe a framework for compositional abstraction based on simulation relations that does support both concepts, and that is suitable for Uppaal. Our approach is very general and the only essential restriction is that the guards of input transitions do not depend on external variables. We have applied our compositional framework to verify the Zeroconf protocol for an arbitrary number of hosts. ...|$|R

From these, conclusions may be drawn on the use {{of executive}} functions.|$|R

50|$|For {{supervised}} learning in discrete <b>time</b> <b>settings,</b> sequences of real-valued input vectors {{arrive at the}} input nodes, one vector at a time. At any given time step, each non-input unit computes its current activation (result) as a nonlinear function of the weighted sum of the activations of all units that connect to it. Supervisor-given target activations can be supplied for some output units at certain time steps. For example, if the input sequence is a speech signal corresponding to a spoken digit, the final target output {{at the end of}} the sequence may be a label classifying the digit.|$|E
50|$|The F-series infra-red {{keyboards}} {{contained a}} real-time clock; during the machine's boot sequence, the BIOS would graphically prompt {{the user to}} press the 'DATE/TIME' key. This would transmit the date and <b>time</b> <b>settings</b> from the keyboard to the computer via IR, setting the RTC in the computer. The Infra-Red trackball {{could also be used}} as a mouse by tilting the unit forward - the ball protrudes from {{the top and bottom of}} the unit and can roll on a surface. The units also shipped with fibre-optic 'Light Pipes' that can channel the IR signals, designed to prevent multiple keyboards and trackballs from interfering with adjacent machines in office environments where multiple F-series computers were (predicted to be) in use.|$|E
50|$|The default dirty cache {{delay time}} was fixed at 2.2 seconds in NetWare 286 {{versions}} 2.x. Starting with NetWare 386 3.x, the dirty disk cache delay time and dirty directory cache delay <b>time</b> <b>settings</b> controlled {{the amount of}} time the server would cache changed ("dirty") data before saving (flushing) the data to a hard drive. The default setting of 3.3 seconds could be decreased to 0.5 seconds but not reduced to zero, while the maximum delay was 10 seconds. The option to increase the cache delay to 10 seconds provided a significant performance boost. Windows 2000 and 2003 server do not allow adjustment to the cache delay time. Instead, they use an algorithm that adjusts cache delay.|$|E

50|$|The player does botany in {{the game}} first by going from a {{gardening}} shop to get some seeds. Some of the plants {{in the game}} are entirely fictional, but fun to grow. Each seed type can be planted in an open hole in the ground, then watered with a watering can. The player may choose the <b>time</b> <b>settings</b> for plants to grown from realistic timing (1 day per growing stage) to very fast timing (1 second per growing stage). Plants can also be removed with the trowel tool. There is also a minigame to catch a gopher and avoid the skunk. Finally the player save the garden and create a new one at any time.|$|E
50|$|Some watches, {{such as the}} Skyhawk A-T line feature {{radio-controlled}} timekeeping. The watches can {{synchronize with}} radio clocks in Japan, North America, and Europe and will automatically select the correct frequency for doing so based upon location of home time zone. The watch actually tracks two time zones—home and world—but synchronizes to the 'home' zone. When traveling, the user may swap the 'home' and 'world' zones—thereby enabling proper time signal reception on a different continent while retaining the other time. The day, date, and daylight saving <b>time</b> <b>settings</b> are also set automatically when the watch is synchronized. These features are comparable to the synchronization with atomic clocks found in Casio Wave Ceptor watches.|$|E

[...] It depicts {{the origins of the}} characters of Jacob (Mark Pellegrino) and his brother, The Man in Black (Titus Welliver), and how they came to be on the island. It also reveals the identities of the corpses discovered in the cave in [...] "House of the Rising Sun."
