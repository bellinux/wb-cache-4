40|$|Spacedesign is an {{innovative}} Mixed Reality (MR) application addressed to aesthetic design of free form curves and surfaces. It {{is a unique}} and comprehensive approach which uses task-specific configurations to support the design workflow from concept <b>to</b> <b>mock-up</b> evaluation and review. The first-phase conceptual design benefits from a workbench-like 3 -D display for free hand sketching, surfacing and engineering visualization. Semitransparent stereo glasses augment the pre-production physical prototype by additional shapes, textures and annotations. Both workspaces share a common interface and allow collaboration and cooperation between different experts, who can configure the system for the specific task. A faster design workflow and CAD data consistency can be thus naturally achieved. Tests and collaborations with designers, mainly from automotive industry, are providing systematic feedback for this ongoing research. As far as the authors are concerned, there is no known similar approach that integrates the creation and editing phase of 3 D curves and surfaces in Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR).

40|$|A {{class of}} Polyakov-loop-modified Nambu [...] Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) {{models have been}} used to support a {{conjecture}} that numerical simulations of lattice-regularized quantum chromodynamics (QCD) defined with a chiral chemical potential can provide information about the existence and location of a critical endpoint in the QCD phase diagram drawn in the plane spanned by baryon chemical potential and temperature. That conjecture is challenged by conflicts between the model results and analyses of the same problem using simulations of lattice-regularized QCD (lQCD) and well-constrained Dyson-Schwinger equation (DSE) studies. We find the conflict is resolved in favor of the lQCD and DSE predictions when both a physically-motivated regularization is employed to suppress the contribution of high-momentum quark modes in the definition of the effective potential connected with the PNJL models and the four-fermion coupling in those models does not react strongly to changes in the mean-field that is assumed <b>to</b> <b>mock-up</b> Polyakov loop dynamics. With the lQCD and DSE predictions thus confirmed, it seems unlikely that simulations of lQCD with μ_ 5 > 0 can shed any light on a critical endpoint in the regular QCD phase diagram.

30|$|The damage {{observed}} on door panels of historical Dutch cabinets {{is illustrated in}} Fig.  2, and, as reported in [10, 25], may be induced by indoor climate fluctuations. The present work aims at gaining more insight into this aspect, by performing an experimental program in which the deformation response and damage resistance of mock-ups of cabinet door panels under relative humidity fluctuations is analysed. Two mock-ups—referred <b>to</b> as <b>mock-ups</b> A and B—were subjected to a single decrease and multiple stepwise decreases in relative humidity, respectively, and four mock-ups—referred <b>to</b> as <b>mock-ups</b> C <b>to</b> F—were exposed to a varying relative humidity profile ranging between 35 and 71 %. <b>Mock-ups</b> C <b>to</b> F also consider {{the influence of the}} presence of cleated ends and veneer layers on the panel response, as illustrated in Fig.  3.|$|R

40|$|ENPOWER is a EURATOM {{collaborative}} research project {{sponsored by the}} European Union. The aim is to produce advanced weld repair techniques and residual stress mitigation procedures for nuclear components in order to {{eliminate the need for}} expensive global Post-Weld Heat Treatment (PWHT). These procedures are based on weld repair optimisation combined with novel Alternative Post Weld Treatments (APWT). Repair procedures have been developed by carrying out parametric numerical studies for various repair and component configurations. APWTs are based on local heating at moderate temperatures (300 - 600 C) to produce local plasticity that redistributes the internal stresses and results in compression in the areas of interest. Two techniques have been identified as prime candidates: namely hot compression and thermal shock techniques. In combination with internal pressure the hot compression technique reveals itself to be very efficient and of most general use. The thermal shock method is effective for repairs in sections up to 25 mm thick. The APWTs were established using numerical models applied <b>to</b> <b>mock-up</b> nuclear components, and validated by measurements. Numerical modelling methods have also been used to study the interactions between residual stresses, post weld treatments, opJRC. F. 4 -Nuclear design safet...|$|E
40|$|Cognitive {{modeling}} {{can provide}} important insights about the usability of software or hard-ware products at all stages of product design. It is not used very often, though, as the cre-ation of cognitive user models is typically done by highly trained experts. These specialists need not only develop the models, but {{have to spend a}} lot of additional time on software interface problems: The cognitive models need to be connected to the interactive system under evaluation. This poster presents ACT-CV, a software library that aims at solving the interface problems of user modeling. The Challenge: Modeling interactive Behavior Cognitive modeling has proven more and more useful for the design and evaluation of hu-man machine interfaces as it allows to predict usability metrics like the time to complete a task or the types of errors that may occur. Modeling relies heavily opon cognitive architec-tures like ACT-R (Anderson, 2007) which closely mimic the cognitive, perceptual, and motor capabilities of human users. Unfortunately, cognitive architectures tend to lock the modeler into highly specialized computer systems (Lisp in the case of ACT-R), creating significant hurdles for the application of a user model to the human machine interface in question (Byrne, 2013). Existing tools to overcome these hurdles either revert <b>to</b> <b>mock-up</b> prototypes of the interface in question (e. g. CogTool, John et al., 2004), require changes to the source code of the original software (e. g. AGIMap, Urbas et al., 2006), or search the computer screen for special pixel color combinations (Segman, Ritter et al., 2006) ...|$|E

The design features a dual membrane envelope, a nearly homogeneous envelope membrane stress distribution, and a minimum surface-to-volume ratio.

Originally designed to provide buoyancy <b>to</b> <b>mock-ups</b> submerged in NASA's weightlessness simulators, the device may have application to water-landed spacecraft which must deploy flotation upon impact, and where launch weight and volume penalties are significant.
