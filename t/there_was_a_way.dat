He co-wrote Dwight Yoakam's hit [...] "It Only Hurts When I Cry" [...] from his 1990 album If <b>There</b> <b>Was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Way,</b> and supplied background vocals. The song was released as a single in 1991, peaking at No.7 on country charts. He began a solo guitar tour in 1990, ending the following year after being diagnosed with lung cancer. His last performance on television occurred on a special tribute to Minnie Pearl which aired on TNN on October 26, 1992, the day after Miller's death.|$|E

Parker then cut the film down to two hours when he {{realized}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to further trim the film. [...] "There {{were a number of}} scenes that paced well when we intercut them rather than letting them play as written in a linear fashion. For instance, we wanted to let the mission briefing scene play normally—this is where the SEAL team is briefed on their target. That scene was followed by a scene of the target beheading a local. We realized that an actual briefing is very technical and rote, so intercutting these scenes helped keep the audience engaged." ...|$|E

[...] He and Eliza Jane spent much of the winter of 1897–1898 drying vegetables, and Ezra Meeker departed for Skagway, Alaska, on March 20, 1898 with [...] of dried produce—Fred Meeker and his wife Clara were already across the border in what would soon be designated as the Yukon Territory. [...] The 67-year-old Meeker, with one business associate, climbed the steep Chilkoot Pass. [...] With thousands of others in boats and on rafts, he floated down the Yukon River once the ice broke up in late May, and sold his vegetables in two weeks in Dawson City. [...] He returned to Puyallup in July, only to set out again with more supplies the following month. [...] This time, he and his son-in-law, Roderick McDonald, opened a store, the Log Cabin Grocery, in Dawson City, and remained through the winter.|$|E
500|$|Snyder's {{first cut}} of the film was three hours long. In keeping the film tight, Snyder dubbed himself [...] "the gatekeeper" [...] of the comic's easter eggs, [...] "while [...] conspire to say, 'No. Length, length, length. Playability.' [...] I've lost {{perspective}} on that now, because to me, the honest truth is I geek out on little stuff now as much as anybody. Like, people will go, 'We've got to cut. You don't need that shot of Hollis Mason's garage sign.' And I'm like, 'What are you talking about? Of course you do. Are you crazy? How will people enjoy the movie without shit like that in it?' So it's hard for me." [...] Snyder cut the film down to 162 minutes when he realized <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to further trim the film: removing the murder of Hollis Mason, the first Nite Owl, which [...] "was easy without destroying the movie".|$|E

2500|$|In 1958 Irv Culver {{presented}} to the Lockheed management an idea for how to rigidly attach the rotor blades of a helicopter to the hub. [...] In 1920, Juan de la Cierva had tried the same concept, but had trouble controlling the rotor, because of excessive gyroscopic moments. [...] Culver's research led him to believe that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to control the excessive pitch and roll moments by incorporating a feedback system into the rotor. Culver's solution to high control moments was a device known as the [...] "compliance factor". [...] It kept the blades forward less than a degree, which would apply a corrective feathering input to the opposite blade. [...] This essentially was the moment feedback system. Before presenting his ideas, he had built a radio-controlled model that demonstrated the feasibility of the concept. [...] Lockheed gave him use of part of a flight test hangar, a flight test engineer and two mechanics.|$|E

2500|$|Spock's {{death was}} {{intended}} to be irrevocable, but Nimoy had such a positive experience during filming that he asked the producers if <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> for Spock to return in a later film. The scene showing Spock's mind meld with McCoy was filmed without actor DeForest Kelley's prior knowledge of its true meaning. Test audience reaction to Spock's death and the film's ending was poor, so Bennett made it more uplifting by adding a final scene revealing Spock's casket on the Genesis planet. During this scene, Nimoy read the [...] "These are the voyages" [...] monologue—which, until then, was used only to begin Star Trek stories, thus implying Spock's [...] "story" [...] might not be over. Director Nicholas Meyer objected but did not obstruct the changes, and even Nimoy did not know about the new scene until he viewed the film. Before the film opened, the media reassured worried fans that Spock would [...] "live again".|$|E

He then begins searching for the [...] "real" [...] hijacker until the joke dawns on him and he realizes that he is the hijacker. The plot thus returns to the beginning, with Tender telling his life story. He mentions that Fertility told him <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> for him to escape the plane before it crashes, but on the record, he can't seem to figure it out.

Jack is and isn't the hero. He falls on his ass {{as much as he}} comes through. This guy is a real blowhard. He's a lot of hot air, very self-assured, a screw-up". Furthermore, the actor felt that [...] "at heart he thinks he's Indiana Jones but the circumstances are always too much for him". Russell felt that the film would be a hard one to market. [...] "This is a difficult picture to sell because it's hard to explain. It's a mixture of the real history of Chinatown in San Francisco blended with Chinese legend and lore. It's bizarre stuff. There are only a handful of non-Asian actors in the cast".|$|E

2500|$|In 1890, Patrick Calhoun {{purchased}} [...] of wooded land atop Cedar Hill {{north of}} Cedar Road. He began {{development of a}} planned community for the wealthy and upper classes, calling it Euclid Heights. The same year, brothers Edmund and William Walton began laying out another development, Cedar Heights, along Bellfield and Grandview Avenues {{on the south side}} of Cedar Road. Calhoun and his business partner, John Hartness Brown, realized that their development would not be a success unless <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> other than dirt roads to ascend the heights. Walking the heights, the two concluded that an electric streetcar up Cedar Glen was the best option. In 1896, Calhoun donated all his property from Euclid Avenue to the foot of Cedar Hill, and on both sides of the ravine of Cedar Glen, to the city of Cleveland and to Cleveland Metroparks. In exchange, Calhoun was given the authority to construct a double-track streetcar line up Cedar Glen. That same year, the Cleveland Railway Company extended its Euclid Avenue Line along Stearns Road to Cedar Glen, up the hill to Euclid Heights Blvd., and then along the boulevard to Coventry Road to serve Calhoun's Euclid Heights development. By 1900, the Cedar Avenue Line streetcar had made Euclid Heights a major development.|$|E

Heinze hand-picked the topics as well as the participating lecturers, bringing public attention to a range of often controversial subjects that were of special interest to him. Two of the lectures garnered particularly strong public interest: one dealt with relations between Catholicism and Judaism (the speakers were Cardinal Edward Cassidy, president of the Pontifical Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews, and renowned British rabbi, Rabbi Norman Solomon). The other lecture focused on homosexuality. Heinze had wanted to discover if <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> [...] "gay and lesbian Jews and Christians [...] find a more comfortable place within their faith-communities." [...] (He had wanted to include Muslim speakers but was unable to find anyone.) The lecture was presented {{in the form of a}} symposium and was entitled [...] "New Jewish and Christian Approaches to Homosexuality." [...] Even in the liberal community of San Francisco, it sparked heated debate because established religion did not normally deal explicitly with the issue.|$|E
