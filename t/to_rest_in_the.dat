5|$|After {{the fall}} of Constantinople in 1453, the codex was brought to Florence by an émigré scholar. It belonged to Niccolo Ridolpho († 1550) Cardinal of Florence. After his death it was {{probably}} bought by Piero Strozzi, an Italian military leader, for Catherine de' Medici. Catherine brought it to France {{as part of her}} dowry, and from the Bourbon royal library it came <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris. The manuscript was bound in 1602.|$|E

5|$|On March 26, 1841, Harrison {{became ill}} with a cold—according to the {{prevailing}} medical misconception of that time, his illness {{was believed to be}} caused by the bad weather at his inauguration, but the illness did not arise until more than three weeks afterwards. Harrison tried <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> White House, but could not find a quiet room because of the steady crowd of office seekers. His extremely busy social schedule also made rest time scarce.|$|E

5|$|The {{bodies of}} the two Neville {{brothers}} were brought back to London. They did not suffer the customary fate accorded to traitors—quartering and display at the city gates.

5|$|Between 1925 and 1928, Ny-Ålesund saw four air {{expeditions to}} the North Pole, {{two of which}} {{required}} {{the construction of an}} airship hangar and mast. The first proposal for an airport in Ny-Ålesund was launched in 1956 by Norsk Polar Navigasjon, who proposed an airport at Kvadehuksletta. Soviet protests against the airport caused the Norwegian authorities to oppose the plans, which were laid <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1960s. Construction at Hamnerabben started in 1965 following the decision to build Kongsfjord Telemetry Station. The airport first hosted service to temporary landing strips near Longyearbyen, but from 1975 served Svalbard Airport. Lufttransport started flights with helicopters in the 1980s, but from 1989 has flown with fixed-wing aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Ceremonies, {{masses and}} an {{enormous}} funeral were held; a funeral train toured Poland. A series of postcards, stamps and postmarks was also released.

5|$|Despite republicanism in Greece, Olga {{was still}} held in high esteem {{and the republican}} {{government}} in Athens offered {{to pay for her}} funeral and repatriate her remains to Greece. Nonetheless, her children declined the offer, preferring to bury her in Italy beside her son, Constantine I, whose body Greece had refused to accept. Her funeral was held on 22 June 1926 at the Orthodox Church in Rome and the next day she was laid <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crypt of the Russian church in Florence. After the restoration of the Greek monarchy in 1935 she was re-interred at Tatoi on 17 November 1936.|$|E
5|$|In the 12th century, the {{institutions}} of central government, which had hitherto accompanied the royal English court as it moved around the country, grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed in one place. For most purposes this was Westminster, although the royal treasury, having been moved from Winchester, came <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tower. While the City of Westminster developed into a true capital in governmental terms, its distinct neighbour, the City of London, remained England's largest city and principal commercial centre, and it flourished under its own unique administration, the Corporation of London. In 1100, its population was around 18,000; by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000. Disaster struck {{in the form of}} the Black Death in the mid-14th century, when London lost nearly a third of its population. London was the focus of the Peasants' Revolt in 1381.|$|E
5|$|On March 26, 1841, William Henry Harrison {{became ill}} with a cold. According to the {{prevailing}} medical misconception of that time, {{it was believed that}} his illness was directly caused by the bad weather at his inauguration; however, Harrison's illness did not arise until more than three weeks after the event. The cold worsened, rapidly turning to pneumonia and pleurisy. He sought <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> White House, but could not find a quiet room because of the steady crowd of office seekers.

5|$|Gilligan {{played in}} the next Test match, without much success, and for the Gentlemen at Lord's. The effects of the injury then forced him <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{following}} weeks and he missed the fourth Test. When he returned for the final Test, {{he did not take}} any wickets and finished the Test series with 17 wickets at an average of 18.94, placing him second in the England bowling averages behind Tate. He batted just three times in the series, scoring 77 runs at 25.66. England won the series 3–0, and although South Africa had not proved to be a strong team, several England players—including Gilligan—had impressed commentators. Gilligan continued to take wickets in the latter stages of the season, but was less successful than before his injury. At the end of the season, he had 103 wickets at 19.36 and 864 runs at 21.07.|$|E
5|$|Prince of Wales fired unopposed {{until she}} began a port turn at 05:57, when Prinz Eugen took her under fire. After Hood {{exploded}} at 06:01, the Germans opened intense and accurate fire on Prince of Wales, with 15-inch, 8-inch and 5.9-inch guns. A heavy hit was sustained below the waterline as Prince of Wales manoeuvred through {{the wreckage of}} Hood. At 06:02, a 15-inch shell struck the starboard side of the compass platform and killed {{the majority of the}} personnel there. The navigating officer was wounded, but Captain Leach was unhurt. Casualties were caused by the fragments from the shell's ballistic cap and the material it dislodged in its diagonal path through the compass platform. A 15-inch diving shell penetrated the ship's side below the armour belt amidships, failed to explode and came <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wing compartments on the starboard side of the after boiler rooms. The shell was discovered and defused when the ship was docked at Rosyth.|$|E
