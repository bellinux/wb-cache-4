40|$|Nearly {{anyone can}} publish on the web. Almost anyone can call {{themselves}} “a journalist”. So is journalism {{as a profession}} {{in danger of being}} swamped by amateurs and marketeers? Sally Begbie proposes a new professionalism to deal with the challenges of commercialism and digital media. Journalists must reclaim their central role as public advocates and providers of impartial and reliable public information. A five-year study by the US Committee of Concerned Journalists, based at Harvard University, framed an appropriate mission statement for journalists of the post-digital era. “The central purpose of journalism”, said the committee, “is to provide citizens with accurate and reliable information they need to function in a free society. ” Two members of that committee, Bill Kovach and Tom Rosential, wrote: “The issue isn 2 ̆ 7 t just the loss of journalism. At stake is whether, as citizens, we have access to independent information that makes it possible for us to take part in governing ourselves. ” Australian journalists have no system of professional accreditation and no common set of enforceable standards by which to monitor and protect their interests. Instead they operate within a mishmash of self-regulatory and regulatory systems, all of which are toothless and are often held up to ridicule by the journalists themselves. Employers have their own ways of counselling, cautioning or dismissing journalists. But these are no different, in effect, from the employment practises that cover all employees, whether they 2 ̆ 7 re working at McDonalds or David Jones. It is often assumed that the Media Entertainment Arts Alliance - the union that subsumed the Australian Journalists Association - can do this job. The MEAA is certainly highly respected by many journalists. Its annual Walkley Awards are the benchmark for quality journalism in Australia. With approximately 10, 000 members, the alliance estimates that its membership includes 70 per cent of all journalists in Australia. But a person is eligible to join the journalist section of the MEAA if they work for any media organisation, {{or in the case of}} freelancers, providing they have had one article published. Is this an adequate entry standard for the profession? Once in, members are required to comply with the AJA Code of Ethics. But the worst penalty a journalist faces for abusing this code is expulsion from the union. They can still work in Australia as a journalist. Other professions ensure that if one of their members acts so unethically as to bring the profession into serious disrepute, then the member faces the possibility of expulsion from the profession. The MEAA does not have the power to exclude someone from the profession: an expelled member can still work in Australia as a journalist. I do not advocate content control nor curbing the freedom of journalists. Quite the contrary; freedom of speech is fundamentally important. I am urging journalists to be concerned about securing their individual futures, and the future of their profession, by acting responsibly and taking responsibility for each other. The only way to do this is to agree on a set of standards, establish one common code of practice and enforce that code by a complaint and appeals program that could end in expulsion from the profession. The public interest demands that the reader or viewer know and have the confidence that their news is being provided to them by a professional journalists, who have applied disinterested professional judgement and are not a mere ciphers for an advertiser, advocate or public relations merchant. There is no difference between a news consumer, a lawyer’s client or a doctors patient. Each has the right to know that there are - and rely upon compliance with - proper professional standards. THE FORMATION of a single national accreditation and registration body for journalists would protect the profession from dodgy operators within their own ranks who bring journalism into disrepute and further erode public confidence in the overwhelming majority of ethical journalists. It would also protect the profession from people outside its ranks who simply claim to be journalists. How have the other professions managed it? They nearly all started out with self-regulatory regimes with no sanctions. Journalists are still there; all the other professions have moved on. Lawyers and doctors have a state-based accreditation and registration system. In New South Wales, for example, the state Medical Board, a statutory authority established under the Medical Practice Act 1992, is independent of the government and the medical profession. It maintains a register of practitioners, considers applications, deals with complaints, administers disciplinary provisions of the legislation which includes deregistration, acts as an advisory body to government and deals with unregistered practitioners and unlawful advertising. Its board consists of representatives from the various medical colleges, a representative of the minister, the department, the Ethnic Affairs Commission, the universities and two from the AMA. The NSW Law Society describes itself as “licensing and regulating authority” and a “trade union” for the solicitors, representing their interests and putting their point of view while simultaneously being responsible for maintaining professional standards of conduct and adjudicating complaints against its members. Twenty-one elected members from within the legal profession control it. The Bar Association plays a similar role for barristers. Engineers took a different approach, coming together before regulation was forced on them. In 1993, their three professional bodies joined together to form the National Professional Engineers Register, which is responsible for setting, monitoring and ensuring compliance with agreed industry standards. It has the power to hear appeals and can suspend or deregister a member. Non-members are required to sign an undertaking to comply with its requirements and to submit to the disciplinary provisions if a complaint is made against them. South Australia, Victoria and NSW have implemented legislation to strengthen the board and discussions continue with the other states and territories. I must stress that it is important not <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> of regulating an industry, and (self-) regulating a profession. We should be careful not to lose sight of the need to protect and develop the profession itself, so that it can met the rapidly changing media landscape may throw up. It is precisely through creating a joint self-regulatory body that covers all Australian journalists that journalists will increase their ability to repeal any backdoor attempt to control content by controlling them. IT IS a matter of urgency that the MEAA, the Australian Press Council and other interested bodies representing journalists begin the dialogue to establish a single joint self-regulatory body for all Australian journalists. A new single self-regulatory body for all Australian journalists would: • help to clarify the contemporary mission of journalism, • provide a unified advocacy body to represent all Australian journalists, • improve the relationship between journalists and their readers, viewers and listeners, • make journalists more accountable through an enforceable and unified code of practice, • defend journalism as an essential source of public information, • provide quality assurance to employers by providing accreditation of journalists. This body needs to establish a common set of standards and a code of practice [...] and enforce them. It needs to set and manage accreditation procedures, which include a national registration scheme. And it needs to establish and manage disciplinary procedures, perhaps enforced by statute It would be reckless for journalists to ignore the force of change engulfing and already beginning to obliterate them. The failure of journalists to put themselves up to the same professional scrutiny they expect from others, will add to their declining status as a profession and their diminishing employment standards. Paradoxically, a strong system of regulation or self-regulation will produce a less risky future for Australian journalists and journalism. It will secure what we all value - a free, independent, respected and responsible news media.

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of those {{proteins}} which might offer exceptions to the law that the fluidity of a protein solution is a linear function of the volume concentration; viz., egg albumin, serum albumin, pseudoglobulin, euglobulin, gelatin, and sodium caseinogenate. Solutions of egg albumin below 20 per cent by weight obey the above law but somewhat below 30 per cent the fluidities begin to be too high, presumably due to the contribution to the fluidity made by the deformation of the particles as they come into contact, as the fluidity approaches zero. The fluidity of serum albumin solutions shows a similar behavior, being exceptional above 15 per cent in weight. Pseudoglobulin and euglobulin give fluidity-concentration curves (Fig. 4) which are linear up to about 2. 5 per cent each in a total range of 20 and 14 per cent respectively. From this singular point both compounds show a second range which is linear. Pseudoglobulin is the only substance whose solutions seem to show a third linear range. We have also used the data of Chick and Martin for sodium caseinogenate and found evidence for two linear régimes. It is desirable at this time {{to call attention to the}} measurements of the flow of glycogen solutions by Botazzi and d'Errico (14) which in Fluidity and See PDF for Structure plasticity, page 207, are expressed in rhes.

In this case it was definitely known that the data for each curve were measured with different viscometers which suggested the possibility of an error in viscometry entering in <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> We have no suspicions as to the reliability of the data studied in this paper; we only wish to caution the readers that our hypotheses based on these data must be regarded with due reserve until confirmed. We have found a formula (11) based on the supposed linear relation between logarithmic fluidities and concentration which is convenient to use within the range, but close examination reveals that it does not reproduce the data for the higher concentrations at 25 ° nor does it permit extrapolation to pure water It is not realistic enough because it does not contemplate any change of régime in going from viscous to non-Newtonian or plastic flow. The formula does not apply to any other of the proteins studied in this paper nor to the great majority of proteins already reported as following the linear law. These are serious objections. We have therefore offered as an alternative a simple formula (24) according to which the fluidities are additive in the viscous régime. When the emulsoid particles approach close packing, they are deformed and this deformation contributes to the flow and the fluidity volume concentration curve is again linear. In fact, there may be one or more additional changes of régime...|$|R
40|$|The current furor and {{confusion}} in the U. S. A. {{over the role of}} "Ebonics" in education is but a recent skirmish in a long-running struggle. It is not new, not confined to "Black English," or to English in general, not confined to education, and certainly not confined to the U. S. A. It is a controversy that surfaces in North America and around the world time and time again. On all five continents, coercive power relationships between socioeconomic elites wielding state power and oppressed groups wielding little or none find linguistic reflexes. The elites speak the "official" state language or the "standard" variety of a language-in the present case, "standard English" (SE) -which they made official or standard; the oppressed groups (not necessarily minorities, as in the present case) are decreed by the same elites to speak a less acceptable or unacceptable language or a socially stigmatized variety of the same language, like "Black English. " Very real objective linguistic differences thus provide yet another excuse for discrimination in many areas of public life, including education (so-called) criminal justice systems, employment, media access, and even labor unions. The public policy decisions in different countries that result from these periodic convulsions often enshrined in statute and case law, concern linguistic human rights, and they have wide-ranging social consequences for hundreds ofmillions of people. The rhetorical barrage surrounding the present struggle serves <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> <b>the</b> real <b>issues,</b> or <b>to</b> ensure that they are not discussed at all, which benefits only one side in the status quo...|$|R
40|$|Four {{layers of}} {{confusion}} obfuscate <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> {{of land in}} Gilbert Camp. First, residents ignore the intended representative of their residence rights. Second, they are <b>confused</b> regarding <b>the</b> “right” way to access land. Third, {{they do not know}} who the “real landowner” is. Fourth, the land boundary has changed continually since the foundation of Honiara. In this article, I try <b>to</b> clarify <b>the</b> <b>confusing</b> <b>issue</b> of land by looking at it from 3 perspectives: (1) The history of land policy in Solomon Islands reveals a long-standing neglect of the indigenous point of view regarding land; (2) ethnographic approaches illustrate how people react to sucha dismissive attitude; and (3) the contemporary preference for patriliny among government officials exemplifies the tendency toward a form of “indigenous essentialism” in which the interests of policymakers and landowners converge. This article demonstrates that <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of land is a legacy from the past that bears major consequences for the future of Solomon Islands...|$|R

In {{a number of}} prior articles, I have tried to distinguish and clarify these various issues, which arise not only in tort law, but also {{in much the same}} form in criminal law and many other areas of the law. I have focused primarily on distinguishing and clarifying <b>the</b> empirical <b>issue</b> of causal contribution and elaborating a comprehensive test, the 2 ̆ 2 NESS 2 ̆ 2 test, for resolving this issue. In this paper, which was prepared for the recent Wade Conference on the Third Restatement of Torts: General Principles, I revisit these issues. I focus more than I previously have on the Restatement 2 ̆ 7 s unhelpful, opaque, confused, and contradictory treatments of these issues, while also commenting on recent scholarship which fails to properly distinguish these <b>issues.</b> I defend <b>the</b> NESS test of causal contribution against some recent criticisms, propose a practical way of properly presenting <b>the</b> causal-contribution <b>issue</b> to students and jurors, criticize alternative proposed tests (including Jane Stapleton 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 targeted but-for 2 ̆ 2 test), further elaborate the notion of causal sufficiency (rather than mere analytical or empirical sufficiency) that underlies the NESS test, and provide a more detailed explanation of the NESS test 2 ̆ 7 s application to the conceptually most difficult types of causation cases, the overdetermined multiple-omission cases...|$|R
500|$|The average anatomist had {{difficulty}} challenging Galen's or Vesalius's research; Galen {{was the most}} famous physician of the Greek era and his works were considered the standard of medical understanding up to and throughout the Renaissance (i.e. for almost two thousand years), and various terms being {{used to describe the}} clitoris seemed <b>to</b> have further <b>confused</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of its structure. In addition to Avicenna's naming it the albaratha or virga ("rod") and Colombo's calling it sweetness of Venus, Hippocrates used the term columella ("little pillar'"), and Albucasis, an Arabic medical authority, named it tentigo ("tension"). The names indicated that each description of the structures was about the body and glans of the clitoris, but usually the glans. It was additionally known to the Romans, who named it (vulgar slang) landica. However, Albertus Magnus, one of the most prolific writers of the Middle Ages, felt {{that it was important to}} highlight [...] "homologies between male and female structures and function" [...] by adding [...] "a psychology of sexual arousal" [...] that Aristotle had not used to detail the clitoris. While in Constantine's treatise Liber de coitu, the clitoris is referred to a few times, Magnus gave an equal amount of attention to male and female organs.|$|R
