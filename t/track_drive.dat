Before the change, US10 followed Dixie Highway and Oakland Avenue southeast into Pontiac to Perry Street and then Perry to Woodward while M-58 was routed along Telegraph and Square Lake roads. After the change, US10 turned south from Dixie Highway onto Telegraph and then east onto Square Lake to connect back to Woodward. The old route through downtown was assigned the Bus. US10 moniker and M-58 was decommissioned as a highway designation. Two years later, I-75 was completed to the east of Pontiac, and the M-24 bypass of the city was turned over to local control. The former Bus. M-24 through downtown was renumbered BL I-75 along with a connection along Square Lake Road out to the freeway. The next year, the streets downtown Pontiac were reconfigured and a loop called Wide <b>Track</b> <b>Drive</b> was created to route traffic around the downtown area. The former routing of BL I-75 on Perry Street in the downtown core was replaced by routing the business loops on Wide <b>Track</b> <b>Drive.</b> Then in 1966, an interchange was built to replace the intersection at Opdyke Road and Square Lake Road.|$|E

50|$|It was {{realised}} {{that running}} the <b>track</b> <b>drive</b> {{over the top}} of the hull was not necessary and work began on a follow-up design in June 1940. The prototype TOG I was delivered in October 1940. Due to the weight, electrical drive was used - the engine driving two generators connected to an electrical motor for each track. The steering wheel was connected to a potentiometer that varied the voltage to the track motors. This strained the drive and track and after these problems with the electro-mechanical drive, it was converted to a hydraulic drive designed by Fluidrive Engineering, a process that took until May 1943 after which it was called TOG 1A. The fluid drive was not satisfactory either. The prototype was sent to Chobham and then seems to have disappeared into history.|$|E
50|$|Since August 1931 the Grand Trunk Western Railroad (GTWR, a {{subsidiary}} of the Canadian National Railway) provided commuter rail service from Pontiac to Detroit. By 1968 the railroad operated six daily commuter trains (three round-trips) between the two cities, with daily ridership averaging 2,812. When Amtrak took over passenger rail service in 1971, the GTWR service was not initially affected since the takeover did not include commuter rail. However, by that time the GTWR began posting losses on the service. On January 2, 1974 the Southeastern Michigan Transportation Authority (SEMTA) took over the GTWR trains and operated them as the Silver Streak. The aging depot turned over by the GTWR was located about 2500 ft to the northwest of the current Pontiac Transportation Center. The GTWR depot was situated east of the tracks on the northwest corner of West Huron Street and Woodward Avenue (known then as Wide <b>Track</b> <b>Drive</b> or Wide Track Circle).|$|E
