5|$|Back in the 15th century, German theologian Nicolaus Cusanus {{speculated that}} the Universe lacked a center and a circumference. He {{believed}} that the Universe, while not infinite, could not be held as finite as it lacked any bounds within which it could be contained. These ideas led to speculations as to the infinite dimension of space by the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno in the 16th century. He extended the Copernican heliocentric cosmology {{to the concept of}} an infinite Universe filled with a substance he called aether, which did not cause resistance to the motions of heavenly bodies. English philosopher William Gilbert arrived at a similar conclusion, arguing that the stars are visible to us only because they are surrounded by a thin aether or a void. <b>This</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> an aether originated with ancient Greek philosophers, including Aristotle, who conceived of it as the medium through which the heavenly bodies moved.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus manavi (Manavi long-fingered bat) is a bat in {{the genus}} Miniopterus {{that occurs in}} east-central Madagascar. First {{described}} in 1906, this species was later included in the mainland African M.minor. A 1995 revision united populations of small Miniopterus from Madagascar and the Comoros as M.manavi, but molecular and morphological studies in 2008 and 2009 showed that <b>this</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> M.manavi in fact included five different species. M.manavi itself was restricted to a few locations in the eastern Central Highlands and populations in the Comoros and northern and western Madagascar were allocated to different species.|$|E
5|$|Upon its {{description}} in 1999, Ambondro was {{interpreted as a}} primitive relative of Tribosphenida (marsupials, placentals, and their extinct tribosphenic-toothed relatives). In 2001, however, an alternative suggestion was published that united it with the Cretaceous Australian Ausktribosphenos and the monotremes (the echidnas, the platypus, and their extinct relatives) into the clade Australosphenida, which would have acquired tribosphenic molars independently from marsupials and placentals. The Jurassic Argentinean Asfaltomylos and Henosferus and the Cretaceous Australian Bishops were later added to Australosphenida, and new work on wear in australosphenidan teeth has called into question whether these animals, including Ambondro, did have tribosphenic teeth. Other paleontologists have challenged <b>this</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> Australosphenida, and instead proposed that Ambondro is not closely related to Ausktribosphenos plus monotremes, or that monotremes are not australosphenidans and that the remaining australosphenidans are related to placentals.|$|E

In this context, resilience is seen as a property of complex adaptive communities rather than of individuals. This paper will explore how <b>this</b> ecological <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> resilience has been taken up both by climate adaptation research and by the Transition Town movement. <b>This</b> ecological <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> resilience is at odds with the individualism of both psychological and economic approaches to resilience in relation to climate change. ...|$|R

5|$|The case {{established}} {{the doctrine of}} fair abridgement, which allowed that abridgements displaying {{a fair amount of}} labour {{on the part of the}} editor, and that differed from the original published work in a significant way, could not be copyright violations. This in effect raised the abridger to the level of an author. The decision did not define the exact parameters that would qualify a work as a valid abridgement. This distinction came with a later case involving an abridgement of Hawksworth's Voyages, in a decision written by Lord Chancellor Apsley. <b>This</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> fair abridgement eventually evolved through common law, initiated from Gyles v Wilcox, into the current concept of fair use. Hardwicke's decision also added the exercise of personal judgement to the list of admissible defences against the charge of copyright infringement, adding to the growing case law establishing that British copyright would be based on labour and not on originality. The opinion advanced the position that copyright law should serve the public interest by promoting the creation of new educational and useful works, rather than focusing on publishing rights. The case played a significant role in the development of English copyright law. The United States federal courts have cited the case as recently as the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The {{second floor}} has a {{matching}} , with windows of equal value {{to those on}} the first floor below. The very latest innovation, sash windows, was used on both floors. The semi-basement and attic storey used the more old-fashioned mullioned and transomed windows, indicating the lower status of the occupants of these floors. It was clearly emphasised from without that the two main floors of the house were purely for state and family use, and the staff and service areas were confined to the semi-basement and attic floors. <b>This</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> keeping staff and domestic matters out of sight (when not required) was relatively new and had first been employed by Pratt in the design of Coleshill House in Berkshire. The contemporary social commentator of the day Roger North lauded back stairs, of which Belton has two examples (5 and 14 on plan), {{as one of the most}} important inventions of his day.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> {{the double}} burden with married couples is a {{worldwide}} phenomenon. Throughout different {{cultures of the}} world, women spend more total hours in work than men do. In Japan, once married, they are still expected to be devoted wives and mothers who give all off their effort to the home, even after {{a full day of}} work. Latin American women, now entering the work force in large numbers, still face what they call doble jornada, or double day's journey. Although in the Latin American culture, men are starting to interact more with the children and helping around the house more, the main domestic responsibilities still fall upon the women of the house. Sometimes women who are primary wage earners are still relegated to most of the domestic work. European men are more likely to play and interact with their children but not likely to participate fully in their daily care. They are more likely to help their wives at home, yet rarely do they tackle all domestic task equally. Men commonly fail to live up to their belief of equal sharing of domestic labor: they may believe in an equal workload in the house, but the inconvenience of taking on work done by their wives stops many from following through.|$|E

25|$|Originally this commandment forbade male Israelites {{from having}} sexual {{intercourse}} with {{the wife of}} another Israelite; the prohibition did not extend to their own slaves. Sexual intercourse between an Israelite man, married or not, {{and a woman who}} was neither married nor betrothed was not considered adultery. <b>This</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> adultery stems from the economic aspect of Israelite marriage whereby the husband has an exclusive right to his wife, whereas the wife, as the husband's possession, did not have an exclusive right to her husband.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known {{writings on}} the circulatory system {{are found in}} the Ebers Papyrus (16th century BCE), an ancient Egyptian medical papyrus containing over 700 prescriptions and remedies, both physical and spiritual. In the papyrus, it acknowledges the connection of the heart to the arteries. The Egyptians thought air came in through the mouth and into the lungs and heart. From the heart, the air travelled to every member through the arteries. Although <b>this</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> the circulatory system is only partially correct, it represents one of the earliest accounts of scientific thought.|$|E
25|$|The term paysagisme abstrait (literally, {{abstract}} landscapism) {{could be}} reserved for a process where the artist senses and tries to capture the 'rhythms' of a landscape. <b>This</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> rhythm is explicitly mentioned {{by a number of}} painters in addition to Messagier; Jean Ren√© Bazaine, Raoul Ubac and Zao Wou Ki. The rhythm of the landscape is experienced by the artist and expressed by the gesture; something the viewer in turn would experience as sensation. The landscape in this case is a direct source of inspiration. It must be felt.|$|E

25|$|This is {{the same}} as the {{definition}} of the derivative for real functions, except that all of the quantities are complex. In particular, the limit is taken as the complex number z approaches z0, and must have the same value for any sequence of complex values for z that approach z0 on the complex plane. If the limit exists, we say that f is complex-differentiable at the point z0. <b>This</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> complex differentiability shares several properties with real differentiability: it is linear and obeys the product rule, quotient rule, and chain rule.|$|E
25|$|For example, a wavelet {{could be}} created {{to have a}} {{frequency}} of Middle C and a short duration of roughly a 32nd note. If this wavelet were to be convolved with a signal created from the recording of a song, then the resulting signal would be useful for determining when the Middle C note was being played in the song. Mathematically, the wavelet will correlate with the signal if the unknown signal contains information of similar frequency. <b>This</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> correlation {{is at the core}} of many practical applications of wavelet theory.|$|E
25|$|A novel {{point is}} that Maimonides connects the Heavenly Sphere {{with the concept of}} an angel: these are seen as the same thing. The Spheres are {{essentially}} pure Intelligences who receive spiritual essence from the Prime Mover. This energy overflows from each one to the next and finally reaches earth and the physical domain. While novel in Judaism, <b>this</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> intelligent spheres of existence also appears in Gnostic Christianity as Aeons, having been conceived at least eighthundred years before Maimonides. Maimonides‚Äô immediate source was probably Avicenna, who may in turn have been influenced by the very similar scheme in Ismaili thought.|$|E
