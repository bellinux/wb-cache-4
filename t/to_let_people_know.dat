The objective behind recording that particular genre was, on one hand, <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>people</b> <b>know</b> that “Italian music is not just opera or classical”, and on the other hand, to honor his father.|$|E

He self-published it in the Philippines between 2006 and 2008 as a four-issue miniseries under the name [...] "Komikero Publishing." [...] The second and third issues had twice as many pages as a standard comic book. In 2006, he sent copies of the first issue to online columnists, reviewers, retailers, and industry insiders <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>people</b> <b>know</b> it existed. This self-promotion led the book to get good reviews from well-known writers like Steven Grant and Neil Gaiman and a widely read interview with Tom Spurgeon on [...] "The Comics Reporter." [...] The Spurgeon interview led the entertainment megastore Forbidden Planet to order copies directly from Alanguilan and promote it with special offers.|$|E

500|$|Independent Film, Holley's debut solo album, was self-released by {{the singer}} in 2008. Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe {{described}} the album {{as being a}} [...] "soul-satisfying project that won't pay the bills". It was reported in October 2008 that Holley had been conducting workshops {{on the art of}} audition. He drew inspiration from his time on American Idol, as well as his experience with artists such as Stevie Wonder, Christina Aguilera, Kanye West and Queen Latifah. While at Berklee College of Music, he offered advice to young singers who wanted to become famous. [...] "Everyone starts out dreaming, and then you get married, have a baby, buy a house and a car, and what I want <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>people</b> <b>know</b> is {{that there are so many}} jobs out there. My thinking is, if you're a musician and you can make music instead of digging a ditch, make it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{subjects}} {{focused on}} in the album's lyrics include Vanilla Ice's abusive childhood and drug addiction. He stated that [...] "I wrote 'Fuck Me' 'cause I know how I've been perceived. [...] "I can {{look back at the}} whole Vanilla Ice thing, and it was played way out. It was just an image thing. I was always real to the music. But it built a huge hurdle for me to get over musically. A lot of people didn't even want to admit they bought a Vanilla Ice record." [...] "Too Cold" [...] is a rap rock remake of Vanilla Ice's biggest hit, [...] "Ice Ice Baby". Vanilla Ice stated that he remade the song because [...] "I wanted <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>people</b> <b>know</b> that I'm not running from anything. This is me. This is what I'm about. I think the music speaks for itself. If the music was whack, nobody'd even care to hear anything about no Vanilla Ice. I just think the music is so strong people are kinda comin' out of the closet. It's like, 'You know, hey, I bought it back in the day, and the new stuff is slammin'.' I think there's some hip-hop influenced, stage-diving, body piercing, tattooed white boys out there who are embracing this new sound." [...] "Too Cold" [...] was originally intended to be released as a hidden track or B-side.|$|E
500|$|A 2006 review asserted: [...] "Many are the {{knowledgeable}} and discriminating {{people for whom}} Rodgers and Hammerstein's South Pacific, brilliantly co-written and staged by Joshua Logan, was the greatest musical of all." [...] In 1987, however, John Rockwell of The New York Times reviewed the City Opera production, commenting that while South Pacific had been innovative for 1949, [...] "Sondheim has long since transcended its formal innovations, and the constant reprises of the big tunes sound mechanical. In 1949, South Pacific epitomized {{the concerns of the}} day– America's responsibilities {{in the world and the}} dangers of racism.... At its 1967 State Theater revival, the show struck many as dated. It still seems that way, with M*A*S*H having contemporized this same setting". [...] A 2008 Huffington Post review criticized the play as having an Orientalist and Western-centric storyline in which stereotypical natives take on [...] "exotic background roles" [...] in relation to Americans, and it characterized the relationship between Cable and Liat as underage prostitution, charging that she [...] "speaks not a word in the whole musical, only smiles and takes the Yankee to bed." [...] South Pacific is the only major American musical set in World War II, but former Marine Robert Leckie wrote his memoir of that conflict, Helmet for My Pillow, after he walked out of a performance: [...] "I have to tell the story of how it really was. I have <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>people</b> <b>know</b> the war wasn't a musical." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{inhabitants}} of the British Isles have been drinking ale since the Bronze Age, but {{it was with the}} arrival of the Roman Empire on its shores in the 1st Century, and the construction of the Roman road networks that the first inns, called tabernae, in which travellers could obtain refreshment began to appear. After the departure of Roman authority in the 5th Century and the fall of the Romano-British kingdoms, the Anglo-Saxons established alehouses that grew out of domestic dwellings, the Anglo-Saxon alewife would put a green bush up on a pole <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>people</b> <b>know</b> her brew was ready. These alehouses quickly evolved into meeting houses for the folk to socially congregate, gossip and arrange mutual help within their communities. Herein lies the origin of the modern public house, or [...] "Pub" [...] as it is colloquially called in England. They rapidly spread across the Kingdom, becoming so commonplace that in 965 King Edgar decreed that there should be no more than one alehouse per village.|$|E
2500|$|After Jang's death, it was belatedly {{revealed}} {{that she had}} been secretly married. She had wed her husband, Kim Young-kyun, while in the U.S. for cancer treatment, and registered the marriage to make it official in Korea just days before her death. Kim later published a book commemorating the 608 days of their relationship, called My Last Gift To Her. The book features previously unreleased photos (including that of their Las Vegas wedding), {{as well as some of}} the letters and text messages they'd exchanged. When asked in an interview why he wrote the book, Kim answered: [...] "Right now, my memories of Jin-young are distinct, but I'm human and someday my memories will grow dimmer. I don't want to lose my memories of being with her. Writing this was my way to deal with that. Someone who writes for a living told me that it helps and is a good method for organizing their emotions, and those words motivated me to write the book. Also, as I've already said in the prologue, Jin-young was an actress who had a great future ahead of her, and I thought it would help in having her remembered beautifully.
