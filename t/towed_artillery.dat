5|$|M34 Prime Mover – M34 Prime Movers {{were simply}} M32B1 Recovery Vehicles without the towing cable and were just used for pulling <b>towed</b> <b>artillery</b> into place. It was {{typically}} reserved for pulling heavy artillery, {{such as the}} 240mm howitzer. It lacked any armament and had four seats for crew. The vehicle also had tail lights, electric outlets for stopping of towed loads, and multiple stowage ports. Production started in 1944 and ended in 1945.|$|E

25|$|The Philippine Army was {{planning}} to purchase a number of 155mm self-propelled artillery to bolster the country’s territorial defense capability. The Department of National Defense opened the bidding for 12 units of 155mm howitzers and 240 rounds of projectiles worth of P438.6 million. The acquisition will boost the existing howitzers in its inventory but were outdated. On 1 April 2014, Israeli company Elbit Systems won the bid and will deliver 12 Soltam ATHOS <b>towed</b> <b>artillery</b> pieces.|$|E

25|$|M7 Priests {{remained}} in {{use during the}} Korean War, and their flexibility compared to <b>towed</b> <b>artillery</b> units led the U.S. Army {{on the path to}} converting fully to self-propelled howitzers. However, the M7's limited gun elevation of 35 degrees hampered its ability to shoot over the tall Korean mountains, so 127 M7B1s were modified to permit the full 65 degrees elevation in a model known as the M7B2. After the Korean war, many of these were exported to NATO countries, notably Italy and Germany.|$|E

500|$|Dietrich {{knew the}} plan had flaws. The Germans had {{captured}} the same terrain {{during the summer}} of 1940 in three days. Now they were being asked to do it in winter in five days. The plan counted on bad weather to keep the Allied planes grounded. Dietrich only had one-quarter the fuel they needed; their plan counted on capturing Allied fuel depots and keeping to an ambitious timetable. Dietrich's assigned route (or Rollbahn) included narrow roads – in many places single-tracks – which would force units of the Kampfgruppe to tail each other, creating a column of infantry and armor up to [...] long. The roads would prevent the attackers from concentrating their forces in the blitzkrieg fashion which had served them so well in the past. The main roads designated for their use had many hairpin turns and traversed steep hillsides that would delay his already slow-moving <b>towed</b> <b>artillery</b> and bridging trains. Dietrich knew that a determined fight at one of these critical choke points by even a token U.S. force could seriously impede his schedule. When Hitler's operations officer Generaloberst Alfred Jodl gave him his orders, Dietrich yelled, [...] "I'm a general, not a bloody undertaker!" ...|$|E

It {{was mainly}} used for transporting military cargo (mainly ammunition), personnel and <b>towing</b> <b>artillery</b> pieces in Czech and later German armies. The design was also license-built in France by Lorraine-Dietrich.|$|R
50|$|Tractors used to <b>tow</b> <b>artillery</b> {{and designs}} with front wheels and tracks {{at the rear}} began to appear prior to the {{outbreak}} of war, often based on agricultural machines such as the Holt tractor.

500|$|However, {{deficiencies}} of the PAVN's armored and heavy artillery forces, essential for attacks on heavily fortified ARVN regimental and divisional base camps, weighed {{heavily on the}} minds of the General Staff planners who drew up the plan presented to the Politburo in October 1974. Much attention was focused on the role ARVN's ammunition shortages played in the collapse of South Vietnam, but it is not known if the PAVN suffered similar shortages. Soviet and Chinese military aid, especially in the category of [...] "offensive weapon" [...] (armor and artillery), declined significantly since the Paris cease-fire. Also, much of PAVN's armor and artillery was in poor condition, and spare parts were in short supply. Most PAVN artillery units, especially in the South, were still equipped only with light mortar, recoilless gun, or single-tube rocket launchers. In the COSVN (Central Office for South Vietnam) area of operations, consisting of the southern half of the country, seven infantry divisions (the 3d, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th) and one corps headquarters (4th Corps) were supported by only five battalions of field artillery, two of which were equipped with captured US-made weapons for which there was little ammunition, and three understrength armored battalions. The PAVN's 2d Corps, with three artillery regiments belonging to its three infantry divisions, a corps artillery brigade, a tank brigade, and a separate armored battalion, could field a grand total of only 89 tanks and armored personnel carrier and 87 <b>towed</b> <b>artillery</b> pieces when it set off to attack Saigon in April 1975.|$|E
