40|$|This thesis {{describes}} <b>TeaBag,</b> {{which is}} a debugger for functional logic computations. <b>TeaBag</b> is an accessory of a virtual machine currently under development. A distinctive feature of this machine is its operational completeness of computations, which places novel demands on a debugger. This thesis describes the features of <b>TeaBag,</b> in particular the handling of non-determinism, {{the ability to control}} nondeterministic steps, to remove context information, to toggle eager evaluation, and to set breakpoints on both functions and terms. This thesis also describes <b>TeaBag</b> 2 ̆ 7 s architecture and its interaction with the associated virtual machine. Finally, some debugging sessions of defective programs are presented to demonstrate <b>TeaBag</b> 2 ̆ 7 s ability to locate bugs. A distinctive feature of <b>TeaBag</b> is how it presents non-deterministic trace steps of an expression evaluation trace to the user. In the past expression evaluation traces were linearized via backtracking. However, the presence of backtracking makes linear traces difficult to follow. <b>TeaBag</b> does not present backtracking to the user. Rather <b>TeaBag</b> presents the trace in two parts. One part is the search space which has a tree structure and the other part is a linear sequence of steps for one path through the search space...|$|R
