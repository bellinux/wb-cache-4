40|$|Abstract. Thrombin stimulates cultured endothelial ceils (EC) to secrete stored von Willebrand factor (vWF), but {{the signal}} {{transduction}} pathways are poorly defined. Thrombin {{is known to}} elevate the concentration of intracellular calcium ([Ca 2 +]i) and to activate protein kinase C (PKC) in EC. Since both calcium ionophores and phorbol esters release vWF, both second messenger pathways have been postulated to participate in vWF secretion in response to naturally occurring agonists. We find that in intact human EC, vWF secretion stimulated by either thrombin or by a thrombin receptor activating peptide, TR(42 - 55), can be correlated with agonist-induced elevations of [Ca 2 +]i.

40|$|Abstract: Ellipticine is a DNA-damaging agent {{acting as}} a prodrug whose {{pharmacological}} efficiencies and genotoxic side effects are dictated by activation with cytochrome P 450 (CYP). Over the last decade we have gained extensive experience in using pure enzymes and various animal models that helped to identify CYPs metabolizing ellipticine. In this review we focus on comparison between the in vitro and in vivo studies and show a necessity of both approaches to obtain valid information on CYP enzymes contributing to ellipticine metabolism. Discrepancies {{were found between the}} CYP enzymes activating ellipticine to 13 -hydroxy- and 12 -hydroxyellipticine generating covalent DNA adducts and those detoxifying this drug to 9 -hydroxy- and 7 -hydroellipticine in vitro and in vivo. In vivo, formation of ellipticine-DNA adducts is dependent not only on expression levels of CYP 3 A, catalyzing ellipticine activation in vitro, but also on those of CYP 1 A that oxidize ellipticine in vitro mainly to the detoxification products. <b>The</b> <b>findin...</b>|$|E

40|$|The “entrepreneurial spirit ” is {{something}} that has long been associated with the driving force behind economic progress and growth. Joseph Schumpeter (1942) stated that the key to the success of markets lies in the spirits of entrepreneurs who persist in developing new products and technologies, through a process he termed as “creative destruction. ” Kaiser (1990) modeled the entrepreneur on the basis of many historical characterizations, including the Schumpeterian innovator, and concluded that the major characteristics of the entrepreneur—innovator, risk taker, and resource allocator—are complementary and inseparable facets of entrepreneurship. Kirzner (1997) argues that the entrepreneurial discovery process is vital to the effectiveness of markets, where discovery entails entrepreneurs discovering profit opportunities by trial and error. In this same respect, Jenner (1998) models the Schumpeterian entrepreneurial process as a dynamic process in which entrepreneurs search for new combinations of products and production techniques that will lead to increased productivity and economic growth. Knight (1921) views the entrepreneur as the bearer of the uninsurable uncertainty present in the marketplace, with the profit earned being the compensation for bearing this uncertainty. Recently, the conceptual link between entrepreneurship and economic growth has received renewed interest by economists. As argued by Minniti (1999), entrepreneurs are the catalysts for economic growth because they create a networking externality that promotes the creation of new ideas and new market formations. <b>The</b> <b>findin...</b>|$|E

Among <b>the</b> major <b>findins</b> were: (1) no differences in recall and recognition scores between limited and unlimited feedback, (2) tau increased with unlimited feedback, but had no significant impact on retrieval, (3) reconstruction assisted recognition as compared to simply reading the materials, and (4) there were no differences in recall or recognition as a function of whether the material was scrambled or in the original order.

Limitations of Feedback on Retrieval Using a Text Synthesis Approach An axiomatic belief in instruction is that feedback in the form of assurance or guidance is conducive to improved achievement. Kulhavy (1977), for example, suggests that feedback should be prompt and frequent, while Frederiksen (1984) declares that appropriate feedback is an integral part of problem solving processes.

40|$|Background: Calodium hepaticum (syn. Capillaria hepatica) is a {{worldwide}} helminth parasite of which {{several aspects of}} transmission still remain unclear. In the Amazon region, the mechanism of transmission based on the ingestion of eggs present in the liver of wild mammals has been suggested {{as the cause of}} the spurious infections described. We performed an epidemiological investigation to determine the incidence, risk of spurious infection and the dynamics of transmission of C. hepaticum in a community of the Brazilian Amazon. Methodology/Principal Findings: Stool samples of 135 individuals, two dog feces and liver tissue from a peccary (captured and eaten by the residents) were analyzed by conventional microscopy. Dog feces were collected from the gardens of households presenting human cases of spurious C. hepaticum infections. Community practices and feeding habits related to the transmission of the parasite were investigated. The individual incidence of spurious infection was 6. 7 % (95 % CI: 2. 08 – 11. 24). Cases of spurious infection were observed in 7. 5 % of the families and the household incidence was from 50 % to 83. 3 %. The risk of spurious infection was 10 -fold greater in persons consuming the liver of wild mammals (p = 0. 02). The liver tissue of a peccary and one feces sample of a dog presented eggs of C. hepaticum. The consumption of the infected liver was the cause of the spurious infections reported in one household. Conclusions/Significance: This is the first identification of a source of spurious infection by C. hepaticum in humans and we describe a high rate of incidence in household clusters related to game liver alimentary habits. <b>The</b> <b>findin...</b>|$|E

As {{research in the area of}} a non-compliment has not yet been fully undertaken in Malaysia, therefore this study was carried out to investigate the perceptions of respondents and understanding of the nature of non-compliment from a gender perspective. It focused on reasons for a noncompliment: which gender has a greater tendency to refrain from giving compliments and the kind of impact that a noncompliment has on interactants. It also examined the relationship between a noncompliment and cultural background. Advocating the focus group as the methodology, the study highlighted the perceptions of the respondents (N = 6) in an educational organization. The respondents in this study comprised of a homogenous group of (N) : 3 Malay females and 3 Malay males. The data collected through the focus group discussions was transcribed and analyzed. The findings demonstrated how analyzing and interpreting noncompliments could generate interesting issues about gender differences. The data revealed that there were significant differences between the perceptions of men and women on the nature of noncompliments.

40|$|Theorizing on {{procedural}} {{justice has}} assumed that people’s reactions to outgroup authorities are {{to a large}} extent based on instrumental concerns. Therefore, attention is primarily directed to outcomes rather than procedures in encounters with outgroup authorities. In the current article we propose that in order for people dealing with outgroup authorities to be strongly affected by procedural fairness, the available outcome information should be ambiguous. Furthermore, we argue that people confronted with an outgroup authority react particularly negatively to unfair procedures that give them negative outcome expectancies. These patterns are not expected in encounters with ingroup authorities. Two experiments support our line of reasoning. The discussion focuses on the implications of these findings for the integration of theoretical perspectives on procedural justice. Copyright # 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Receiving fair treatment from authorities is an important aspect of people’s lives. Ever since the early work by Thibaut and Walker (1975), effects of procedural justice and injustice on people’s judgments and behaviours have been investigated and found in various social settings (for an overview, see Lind & Tyler, 1988). An example of a typical procedural justice effect is <b>the</b> frequently replicated <b>findin...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} and improvement of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping algorithms. In particular, {{we are interested in}} reliable and effective techniques for unstructured large scale environments. While previous researcher focused on the analysis of class of algorithms or general effects of different algorithms (e. g. complexity, convergence or consistency), in this thesis we focus on analyzing the mapping process itself. At first, we present an introspection analysis that allows efficient optimizations for Rao-Blackwellized SLAM on grid maps. The key idea is based on an analysis of the mapping process which allows us to perform filter updates conditioned to the state of the mapping system: localization, mapping or loop closing. We are able to update the complex posterior with substantially less resources by performing the computations only for a set of representatives instead of for all potential hypotheses. Extending this introspective analysis from a filter perspective to a general one, we find out that the SLAM problem can de decomposed in three main subproblems: a) incremental mapping, that is the process of providing local constraints between consecutive poses, {{in order to maintain the}} map locally consistent; b) loop closure: that is <b>the</b> process of <b>findin...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Correctly staging {{lung cancer}} is {{important}} because the treatment options and the prognosis differ significantly by stage. Several noninvasive imaging studies including chest CT scanning and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning are available. Understanding the test characteristics of these noninvasive staging studies is critical to decision making. Methods: Test characteristics for the noninvasive staging studies were updated from the first iteration of the lung cancer guidelines using systematic searches of the MEDLINE, HealthStar, and Cochrane Library databases up to May 2006, including selected metaanalyses, practice guidelines, and reviews. Study designs and results are summarized in evidence tables. Results: The pooled sensitivity and specificity of CT scanning for identifying mediastinal lymph node metastasis were 51 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 47 to 54 %) and 85 % (95 % CI, 84 to 88 %), respectively, confirming that CT scanning has limited ability either to rule in or exclude mediastinal metastasis. For PET scanning, the pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity for identifying mediastinal metastasis were 74 % (95 % CI, 69 to 79 %) and 85 % (95 % CI, 82 to 88 %), respectively. These findings demonstrate that PET scanning is more accurate than CT scanning. If the clinical evaluation in search of metastatic disease is negative, <b>the</b> likelihood of <b>findin...</b>|$|R
40|$|Hermansky-Pudlak {{syndrome}} type 2 (HPS 2) is a syndrome {{caused by}} mutations in the beta- 3 A subunit of the adaptor protein (AP) - 3 complex (AP 3 B 1 gene). We describe five unreported cases with four novel mutations, {{one of which}} caused aberrant pre-mRNA splicing. A point mutation c. 2702 C>G in exon 23 of the AP 3 B 1 gene caused deletion of 112 bp in the mRNA in two siblings. This mutation activates a cryptic donor splice site that overrules the wild-type donor splice site of this exon. Three other novel mutations in AP 3 B 1 were identified, that is, a nonsense mutation c. 716 G>A(p. Trp 239 Ter), a 1 -bp and a 4 -bp deletion c. 177 delA and c. 1839 _ 1842 delTAGA, respectively, both causing frameshift and premature termination of translation. Mass spectrometry in four of these HPS 2 patients demonstrated the (near) absence of all AP- 3 complex subunits. Immunoelectron microscopy on the neutrophils of two of these patients showed abnormal granule formation. We found clear mislocalization of myeloperoxidase in the neutrophils even though the content of this protein but not the activity seemed to be present at normal levels. In sum, HPS 2 {{is the result of}} the absence of the entire AP- 3 complex, which results in severe neutropenia with a defect in granule formation as <b>the</b> major hematological <b>findin...</b>|$|R
