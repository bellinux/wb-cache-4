5|$|The AIF relinquished {{control over}} the men and {{responsibility}} for them while <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NRRF, but undertook to repatriate them to Australia after they returned from Russia. Their motivations for joining were diverse, although few seemed have been political. Some had arrived in Britain as reinforcements too late to see any fighting during the war, and wanted to experience active service before returning to Australia. Others were decorated veterans {{and may have been}} motivated by a desire to see Russia, whilst some may have been unable to settle down after their wartime experiences, and could have viewed service as a means of postponing their return to civilian life.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 19th century, {{many more}} Arabians came to Australia, though most {{were used to}} produce {{crossbred}} horses and left no recorded purebred descendants. The first significant imports to be permanently recorded with offspring still appearing in modern purebred Arabian pedigrees were those of James Boucaut, who in 1891 imported several Arabians from Wilfred and Lady Anne Blunt's Crabbet Arabian Stud in England. Purebred Arabians were used to improve racehorses {{and some of them}} became quite famous as such; about 100 Arabian sires are included in the Australian Stud Book (for Thoroughbred racehorses). The military was also involved in the promotion of breeding calvalry horses, especially around World War I. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foundation of several breeds considered uniquely Australian, including the Australian Pony, the Waler and the Australian Stock Horse.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{the text}} of Asser's Life is known from a {{multitude}} of different sources. Various transcripts {{had been made of}} the Cotton manuscript and a facsimile of the first page of the manuscript had been made and published, giving more direct evidence for the hand of the scribe. In addition to these transcripts, the extracts mentioned above made by other early writers have been used to help assemble and assess the text. Because of the lack of the manuscript itself and because Parker's annotations had been copied by some transcribers as if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text, scholarly editions have had a difficult burden. There have been multiple editions of The Life published, both in Latin and in translation. The 1904 critical edition by W. H. Stevenson, Asser's Life of King Alfred, together with the Annals of Saint Neots erroneously ascribed to Asser, still provides the standard text. An important recent translation, with thorough notes on the scholarly problems and issues, is Alfred the Great: Asser's Life of King Alfred and Other Contemporary Sources by Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge.|$|E

5|$|As mounted infantry, the {{regiment}} rode into battle on their horses but {{were expected to}} dismount and fight on foot. The regiment fought predominantly {{against the forces of}} the Ottoman Turkish Empire. Their first engagement was in the Gallipoli Campaign between May and December 1915, during which they participated in the largest battle of that theatre at Chunuk Bair and the fighting for Hill 60. Evacuated to Egypt, {{the regiment}} took part in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign from 1916 to 1918. Their early battles included Romani, Gaza and Beersheba. Later in the war, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> force that occupied the Jordan Valley and took part in the raids on Amman and Es Salt. Their final wartime operation was in connection with the capture of the Turkish Fourth Army. During the four years of war, the regiment sustained 334 dead from all causes and 555 wounded, several of those more than once. After the war, the regiment played a minor role in the Egyptian Revolution of 1919 before it was disbanded in June 1919.|$|E

From 1966–76 <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Esk Association before returning to Deloraine. The club closed in 1982 {{due to a lack}} of both players and support from locals.

He played for Richmond 1925–31 and Essendon for his final Victorian Football League season in 1932. Ron McGowan was at Meander School in the 1950s.

He later played with South Adelaide, and spent time as Footscray's selection committee's chairman.|$|E

5|$|The Grand Fleet sortied on the {{afternoon}} of 23 April 1918 after radio transmissions revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. The Germans were too far ahead of the British, and no shots were fired. In October, Temeraire and her sister ship, , were transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet, commanded by Vice-Admiral Sir Somerset Gough-Calthorpe. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> squadron that entered the Ottoman capital, Constantinople, on 13 November, following the Armistice of Mudros.
