Because of the low availability and the difficulties in the preparation of metallic scandium, which was first done in 1937, applications for scandium were not developed until the 1970s. <b>The</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> of scandium on aluminium alloys were discovered in the 1970s, and its use in such alloys remains its only major application.

The bill failed, but Johnson persisted in re-introducing it every year. In 1824, it passed the Senate, but was too late to be acted upon by the House. It passed the Senate a second time in 1828, but again, the House failed to act on it, and the measure died for some years, owing to Johnson's exit from the Senate the next year.|$|E

5|$|Erin Ryan and {{her colleagues}} {{performed}} a 2009 study {{on the effect of}} the use of American Sign Language (ASL) in Blue's Clues episodes. They analyzed 16 episodes over two weeks for the content and frequency of the signs used and found a high incidence of ASL usage by various characters, but that it was inconsistent, especially in the connection between English words and their corresponding signs. The purpose of signed communication and its connection with ASL and the Deaf community was not clearly explained, either. The researchers speculated that hearing children with no previous ASL exposure would be familiarized with ASL and the deaf by these episodes, thus reducing the stigma attached to deafness and hard of hearing individuals. Based on other research about <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> of teaching ASL to hearing children, the researchers also speculated that it could lead to an increase of vocabulary skills and IQ, as well as improve interpersonal communication. They surmised that deaf children would feel more included and less isolated and be provided with the opportunity to view positive models of ASL and deaf people.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} focused on changes of anthropometrical (body weight, BMI, WHR,…) or {{biochemical}} parameters (mostly plasma lipid levels) {{as a result of the}} interactions between common APOA5 variants and dietary habits (polyunsaturated fatty acid intake, n-3 and n-6 fatty acid intake, total fat and total energy intake, alcohol intake), dietary (lowering the energy intake) and/or physical activity interventions or dyslipidaemic (using statins or fenofibrate) treatment. Due to the high heterogeneity of the examined populations, differences in protocol and/or interventions used, the studies are difficult to directly compare and draw definitive conclusions. However, with caution, it could be concluded that carriers of the minor C-1131, Trp19, or T553 alleles are in some cases less prone to <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> of environmental and/or pharmacological interventions. Some papers suggest the importance of the interactions between APOA5 and other genes, especially with common APOE (OMIM acc. No. 107741) three allelic (E2, E3, and E4) polymorphism, in the modulation of plasma lipids. In these cases, the interaction between minor alleles of both genes seems to be of importance. In the general population, APOE4 seems to have the potential to diminish the effect of minor APOA5 rs662799 and rs3135506 alleles, especially in females. Interaction between APOE and APOA5 Ser19˃Trp has been suggested to play some role in the development of type III hyperlipidaemia. Further studies, in which interaction with APOA5 has been described, have included, for example, variants within FTO, lipoprotein lipase, USF-1 and FEN-1. They have also focused not only on plasma lipids, but on BMI values or hypertension as well.|$|E

30|$|The {{isometric}} twitch torque elicited {{before each}} maximal voluntary concentric contraction significantly increased {{to a similar}} extent in both velocity conditions. In addition, the time-course changes in isometric twitch torque were similar between the two velocity conditions. In our study, the change in isometric twitch torque was measured to represent the extent of <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> of <b>the</b> conditioning contraction. Since twitch contractions were elicited in an identical manner (isometrically in both velocity conditions), the current {{results indicate that the}} extent of <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> of <b>the</b> conditioning contraction was not different between the two velocity conditions. Thus, the observed difference in the change of maximal voluntary concentric torque between the two velocity conditions should be due to the difference of the sensitivity to <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> induced by <b>the</b> conditioning contraction, that is, myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation (Sweeney et al. 1993).|$|R

The model tests the relationship between input variables: organizational (Organizational Support), group-related (Group Size, Shared Experience and Group Heterogeneity) and individual (Member Competency and Member Activeness); process variables: group production, group well-being and member support: and an output variable: group effectiveness.
