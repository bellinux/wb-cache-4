500|$|They {{climb up}} into the {{projection}} booths, perceiving the film projectors as [...] "spaghetti merry-go-rounds". They check each movie until they find the right one, and are awed by the movie. Lou goes to the concession stand to get some snacks. As Phil tries <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> because the others are crowding the window, Phil falls {{onto one of the}} film projectors and starts riding it around. Soon the rest of the babies start riding them. Then they grab the film and run around with them, tangling them up together as the films begin to unravel and break.|$|E

500|$|After reading each script, Foley {{would do}} her own research, before {{discussing}} {{the look of}} the episode with the writers. She then studies the comics, general fashion, and history <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> that is recognizable to fans, but fits into the more realistic world of the series. Costumes are either custom made or bought, and the actors are brought in for fittings before filming. This process was often challenging due to the series' eight-day-per-episode schedule. Foley stated that all costumes take a similar amount of time to create, whether they are based on the comics or not. Marvel CCO Joe Quesada is involved in the approval process when costuming preexisting characters, including Daisy Johnson's Quake costume that is introduced in the third season. The Quake costume incorporates elements from the comic version of the character, and was intended to show that Quake [...] "could easily be part of the Avengers". Foley took steps to differentiate the Quake costume from Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow costumes from the films, but was [...] "flattered" [...] by comparisons made between them. Foley was also adamant about not sexualising characters such as Quake to show that [...] "these characters don't have to be sexualised, that they're powerful, strong women", and so avoided [...] "a lot of cleavage, you don't see high heels. It's about practicality." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the regulars}} at the Dunbar {{in its heyday}} was future mayor Tom Bradley, then a young police officer. Bradley would stop in for coffee and conversation.

2500|$|Gotti and Gravano {{arrived at}} the {{restaurant}} shortly before 5 o'clock and, after circling the block, parked their car across the intersection and within view of the entrance. Around 5:30, Gravano spotted Castellano's Lincoln Town Car stopped at a nearby intersection and, via walkie talkie, alerted the team of hitmen stationed outside the restaurant of Castellano's approach. Castellano's driver, Thomas Bilotti, pulled the car up {{directly in front of}} the entrance. As Castellano and Bilotti exited the Lincoln, the roughly half dozen shooters moved in and opened fire, killing both men in a barrage of bullets. As the hat-and-trench-coat-adorned men slipped away into the night, Gotti calmly drove the car past the front of the restaurant <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at the scene. Looking down at Bilotti's body from the passenger window, Gravano remarked, [...] "He's gone." ...|$|E

60|$|Fully {{five minutes}} passed, {{and then the}} bear {{stretched}} himself and commenced to sniff the air. Then, of a sudden, he arose on his hind legs <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> better <b>look</b> at his surroundings.|$|R

After all, Letty, I don't {{know whether}} I like {{officers}} {{so much better}} than other men,"--and she twisted her neck round <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at her back in the pier-glass, and gave her dress a little pull just above her bustle.|$|E
6000|$|He turned nervously in {{his seat}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at her, then shifted the clutch and slowly started the car. The woman sat quiet. While bumping over the uneven road at a {{reckless}} speed the driver turned at times to cast stealthy glances at the person beside him. Finally he asked in exasperation: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'They {{shall be}} ordered, sir,' I answered, and away I went; {{and the way}} in which all the women in the house went on about that boy and his bold spirit was a thing to see. They climbed up all sorts of places <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at him, and they peeped, seven deep, through the keyhole.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, of course, my dear boy," [...] {{returned}} Herbert, {{in a tone}} of surprise, {{and again}} bending forward <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> nearer <b>look</b> at me. [...] "He says it all. I have no other information." ...|$|R

6000|$|The news soon {{spread around}} the ranch that the [...] "tenderfeet" [...] had killed a big bobcat, and all the hands came <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at the beast.

The animal was prepared for stuffing, and then sent off by express to a taxidermist in the city.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{you know}} she is a real true beauty and no mistake,' said Bill, {{beginning}} to feel a personal pride in her; 'there's Miles raving about her, and every one runs about saying, [...] "Have you seen little Underwood's handsome sister?"

60|$|And at {{the words}} Michael bristled, dragged himself clear of the woman's detaining hands, and, with a snarl, whirled about <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at the black boy who must have just then entered the room and aroused the white god's ire. But there was no black boy. He looked on, still bristling, to the door.

60|$|I did not, {{could not}} answer. I saw Grace endeavouring <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at my countenance, {{as if to}} observe {{the effect of the}} scene.

The sight, I believe, aroused feelings that had begun to yield to the influence of the last great change; for, when my sister spoke next, it was with a tenderness of accent that proved how hard it for those who are deeply affectionate to lose their instincts.|$|E
