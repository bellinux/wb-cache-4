5|$|And so matters stood {{until the}} massive PAVN/NLF Tet Offensive of early 1968. Although a {{tactical}} victory for American and South Vietnamese forces, Tet became a political disaster. The American public (who had been reassured by President Lyndon B. Johnson and the Pentagon that the communists were incapable of launching any such actions) were {{stunned by the}} size and ferocity of the offensive. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of the}} tunnel had been extinguished, if it had ever existed at all. The president, in an attempt to nudge Hanoi to the negotiating table, decreed an end to bombing operations in North Vietnam north of the 20th parallel, effectively ending Rolling Thunder on 11 November 1968.|$|E

25|$|The two {{children}} who modelled {{for the cover}} were siblings Stefan and Samantha Gates. The photo shoot was a frustrating affair {{over the course of}} ten days. Shooting was done {{first thing in the morning}} and at sunset in order to capture <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>at</b> dawn and dusk, but the desired effect was never achieved due to constant rain and clouds. The photos of the {{two children}} were taken in black and white and were multi-printed to create the effect of 11 individuals that can be seen on the album cover. The results of the shoot were less than satisfactory, but some accidental tinting effects in post-production created an unexpectedly striking album cover. The inner sleeve photograph was taken at Dunluce Castle nearby the Causeway.|$|E
25|$|At {{times it}} would be {{necessary}} to summon people to come to the mote for judgement, proclamations, gatherings, etc. This was sometimes done by ringing a bell, which was fitted upon or beside the moot hill, especially when a date for the meeting had not been previously set. At Greenhills near Barrmill in North Ayrshire a different method {{is said to have been}} employed, namely that of raising a flag at the Bore stone; a prominent site near the moot hill. It is likely that bonfires would have been lit as a signal, either from the smoke during the day or <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>at</b> night. A 'Bonfire hill' place name survives at Stewarton in East Ayrshire and a 'Bonfire knowe' is recorded at Kilmarnock. The Tarbolton moot was still used for lighting bonfires up until the 19th-century at least and the name Shinny Hill is suggestive of traditional bonfires; a 'Shinicle' being a halloween bonfire.|$|E

50|$|Due to the {{possibility}} of refraction, <b>the</b> <b>light's</b> direction <b>at</b> emission is generally not the same as its direction at reception. In refractive media, <b>the</b> <b>light's</b> path generally deviates from the straight distance between the points of emission and reception. The Doppler effect depends on the component of the emitter's velocity parallel to <b>the</b> <b>light's</b> direction <b>at</b> emission, and the component of the receiver's velocity parallel to <b>the</b> <b>light's</b> direction <b>at</b> absorption. This does not contradict Special Relativity.|$|R
25|$|Under {{the command}} of Captain Peter Nicol, Loch Sloy was on passage from Glasgow to Adelaide and Melbourne with a load of general cargo and seven passengers, {{including}} 2 women; David Kilpatrick, a cook from Glasgow (25), George Lamb, a clerk from Edinburgh, (30), Robert Logan, a piano tuner from Inverness, (40), Alexander McDonald, an engineer from Aberdeen (34), Captain Osmond Leicester (30) and Mrs Leicester (real name Blanche Sophia Meyer-Edmunds, 26, but listed as 30; Osmond's real wife Fermina had been abandoned) of Liverpool, and Rosalind Cartlidge (25). In {{the early hours of}} 24 April 1899, she met with disaster on the coast of Kangaroo Island {{at the mouth of the}} Investigator Strait, South Australia. The ship overran her distance when trying to pick up <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>at</b> Cape Borda. She was too close inshore and the light was hidden by the cliffs between Cape Bedout and Cape Couedie. In the darkness of the morning she ran full on to a reef 300 yards from shore to the north of the Casuarina Islets in Maurpetuis Bay.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, Big Finish {{released}} a special 50th Anniversary story, <b>The</b> <b>Light</b> <b>at</b> the End, {{in which the}} Master (Geoffrey Beevers) implements a plot to trap and destroy all eight incarnations of the Doctor. The Eighth Doctor and Charley meet up with the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) and Leela (Louise Jameson), the Fifth Doctor (Peter Davison) and Nyssa (Sarah Sutton), the Sixth Doctor (Colin Baker) and Peri and the Seventh Doctor (Sylvester McCoy) and Ace (Sophie Aldred), and working together (along with the First Doctor (William Russell), Second Doctor (Frazer Hines) and Third Doctor (Tim Treloar)), manage to break free of the Master's trap and prevent time from being rewritten so that the Doctor would never have left Gallifrey. Companions Susan (Carole Ann Ford), Ian Chesterton (William Russell), Vicki (Maureen O'Brien), Steven Taylor (Peter Purves), Sara Kingdom (Jean Marsh), Polly (Anneke Wills), Jamie McCrimmon (Frazer Hines), Zoe Heriot (Wendy Padbury), Jo Grant (Katy Manning), Tegan Jovanka (Janet Fielding) and Turlough (Mark Strickson) also made appearances in the audio drama.|$|E

[...] He also surmised that Gladwell feels guilty about his success and believes that Christopher Langan should have experienced the same success that he had.|$|E

500|$|As {{part of his}} naval reforms, Grand Duke Constantine Nikolaevich of Russia demanded {{modernization}} of the Kõpu lighthouse, in 1859. In May 1860, a novel gyratory device (manufactured by Le Paute in Paris) was installed. It rotated at a speed of one revolution per four minutes, using a clockwork pulley-weight system. The device had one Carsel lamp with four concentric light sources and a Fresnel lens. The lamp consumed [...] of rapeseed oil hourly, and the fuel pump was powered by the same clockwork mechanism.
