40|$|The author reviews {{possible}} {{trade and}} exchange rate policies of the former Soviet Union. Alternative exchange rate regimes, including a monetary union are considered. For Russia, a fixed but adjustable regime is most realistic. Frequent adjustment may be desirable, to prevent the use of trade restrictions to achieve balance of payments objectives. The author examines the need for transitional tariffs, including the argument for a <b>temporary</b> uniform <b>tariff</b> that {{is higher than the}} long-run revenue <b>tariff.</b> The <b>temporary</b> uniform <b>tariff</b> is designed to prevent temporary overshooting of the exchange rate. The case for a free trade area is strong because the republics of the former Soviet Union are so highly specialized, but there will be problems if price controls remain and differ among the republics. There could be a free trade area even if there is no monetary union. The author concludes that one approach to trade policy is to have no trade policy - to have completely free trade with convertibility for current account transactions. Some tariffs and export taxes may be justified, at least as second-best policies. If so, the author stresses that four principles be observed: 1) barriers to existing trade between the republics should not be set up; 2) all quantitative control measures should be avoided; 3) tariff and export tax structures should be very simple; and 4) trade policy should be transparent.

40|$|This paper analyze {{these effects}} of a tariff in an intertemporal {{optimizing}} model, emphasizing the role of capital accumulation. Three types of increases in the tariff rate are considered: (i) unanticipated permanent; (ii) unanticipated temporary; (iii) anticipated permanent. There are two main general conclusions {{to be drawn from}} the analysis. The first is that the introduction (or increase) of a tariff is contractionary, both in the short run and in the long run. In particular, employment is reduced both in the short run and in the long run, so that there is no significant intertemporal tradeoff, as obtained by previous authors. The fail in the long-run capital stock causes an immediate reduction in the rate of investment, which in turn leads to a current account surplus. While this response of the current account is in accordance with much (but not all) of the existing literature, the mechanism by which it is achieved, namely the decumulation of capital, has not been previously considered. Also, the fact that the declining capital stock is accompanied by an accumulation of foreign bonds means that the savings effect of the tariff is unclear, depending upon which influence dominates. This ambiguity of savings is, however, very different from those occurring in other studies. The second major conclusions {{stems from the fact that}} the steady state depended upon the initial stocks of the assets. As a consequence, a <b>temporary</b> <b>tariff,</b> by altering these initial conditions for some later date when the tariff is removed, leads to a permanent effect on the economy. ...|$|R

With the presence of a positive network externality, the model will guarantee the possibility of hysteresis, i. e. multiple equilibria. Moreover, welfare is unambiguously increasing in the number of producers.;Chapter 2 applies the model developed in Chapter 1 to study exchange rate pass-through issues under different exogenous shocks. I addition, we discuss the hysteresis effects of <b>temporary</b> <b>tariff</b> protection. Exchange rate pass-through will generally be complete (incomplete) with (without) the entry or exit of foreign firms. Numerical examples are constructed to illustrate the predictions of the model.

We also study the impacts of a monetary shock to the economy. Similarly, the monetary shock (a shock to monetary growth rate) can cause hysteresis in this economy. We also construct numerical examples to compare the case of a monetary shock with the case of a real shock.;Chapter 4 contains an empirical test of Baldwin 2 ̆ 7 s hypothesis of hysteresis by using data on Canadian exports. We estimate the markup coefficient for the exports of each of five industries and test the hypothesis that hysteresis is present by examining the stability of these markup coefficients.

This dissertation examines the impact of fiscal and commercial policies on the current account, real domestic output and the real exchange rates {{within the context of a}} small open economy. Some recent studies suggest that due to persistent and increasing fiscal deficits of the 1980 s, permanent and transitory government spending and tariffs have had different effects on the current account, trade balance, real domestic output and the real exchange rate. However, inconsistent fiscal and commercial policies pursued by the developing countries and other inherent institutional factors also exerted some constraints on key macroeconomic variables that affected their economies during the 1980 s. To address these issues, this dissertation develops a model to examine the effects of government spending and tariffs on the real domestic output, the real exchange rate and the current account using Two- and Three-Stage Least Squares estimation methods. The empirical results of this dissertation suggest that depending on the economic structure and the level of development, increases in total government expenditures and tariffs do have significant impacts on the real domestic output, the real exchange rate and the current account. The cumulative permanent government spending raises the real domestic output, while the temporary government spending reduces it. Tariffs tend to cause a reduction in real output, an appreciation of the real exchange rate and a deterioration of the current account. The cumulative permanent and <b>temporary</b> <b>tariffs</b> have identical effects on the real domestic output, the real exchange rate and the current account. The results from the simultaneous estimation also suggest an appreciation of the real exchange rate tends to reduce real domestic output and causes a deterioration of the current account. Granger causality tests were also conducted, as well as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, which suggested that some of the Nigerian time series data have unit roots. The cointegration and error-correction regressions results seem to suggest the existence of a long-run relationship and short-run dynamics among the endogenous and exogenous variables in the models...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a minimal general {{equilibrium}} intertemporal model, with optimizing consumers and producers, is developed {{to analyze the}} process of real exchange rate determination. The model is completely real, and considers a small open economy that produces and consumes three goods each period. The model {{is also used to}} analyze {{the way in which the}} current account responds to several shocks. The working of the model is illustrated for the case of two disturbances: the imposition of import tariffs, and external terms of trade shocks. In the case of import tariffs, a distinction is made between temporary, anticipated, and permanent changes. It is shown that, without imposing rigidities or adjustment costs, interesting paths for the equilibrium real exchange rate can be generated. In particular "overshooting" and movements in opposite directions in periods one and two can be observed. Precise conditions under which <b>temporary</b> import <b>tariffs</b> will improve the current account are derived. Finally, several ways in which the model can be extended to take into account other issues such as changes in the fiscal deficit, and financial deregulation are discussed in detail. ...|$|R

40|$|A dynamic specific-factors {{model with}} {{adjustment}} costs of investment {{is used to}} study the impact of tariffs on the current account. A permanent increase in tariffs generates a current account deficit, as the import-competing sector spreads the increase of the capital stock over time. A <b>temporary</b> increase in <b>tariffs</b> has ambiguous effects. If the size and duration of the tariff are large enough, a strong response in investment could outweigh the increased savings and the current account deteriorates. For small and short-lived tariffs, the postponement of investment reinforces that of consumption, leading to a current account surplus.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effects of}} a <b>temporary</b> increase in <b>tariffs</b> on the performance and behavior of U. S. manufacturers. Using a dataset that includes the full population of U. S. manufacturing plants, I show that an apparent positive correlation between antidumping duties and traditional revenue productivity is likely misleading. For the subset of plants reporting quantity-based output data, increases in prices and markups artificially inflate the effect of antidumping duties on revenue productivity, while physical productivity actually falls. Moreover, antidumping duties allow low-productivity plants to continue producing protected products, slowing the reallocation of resources from less productive to more productive uses. Antidumping duties - United States; Manufacturing industries - United States...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a general {{equilibrium}} intertemporal model with optimizing consumers and producers is developed to analyze how temporary terms-of-trade disturbances affect {{the path of}} real exchange rates and the current account. Changes in the internal terms of trade (arising from tariff changes) and to the external terms of trade are considered. The model is completely real, and considers a small open economy that produces and consumes three goods each period. It is shown that, without imposing rigidities or adjustment costs, interesting paths for the equilibrium real exchange rate can be generated. In particular, "equilibrium overshooting" can be observed. Precise conditions under which a <b>temporary</b> import <b>tariff</b> will worsen the current account in period 1 are derived. The way in which temporary and permanent external terms-of-trade shocks will affect the current account are analyzed. Several {{ways in which the}} model can be extended are discussed. The results obtained from this model have important implications for the design of balance of payments policy and for the analysis of real exchange rate misalignment and overvaluation.

5000|$|On September 3, 2007, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) {{issued the}} Telecommunication (Broadcasting and Cable Services) Interconnection (Fourth Amendment) Regulation 2007, which went into law on December 1; the rules require all {{broadcasters}} to offer channels on an {{a la carte}} basis. The regulation states, [...] "All broadcasters will compulsorily offer all their channels on a la carte basis to DTH operators. Additionally, they may also offer bouquets, {{but they will not}} compel any DTH operator to include the entire bouquet in any package being offered by DTH operators to their subscribers". Prior to the regulation, only customers in areas covered by the conditional access system (CAS), and cable systems providing the services, had the option of choosing to buy only the channels they were interested in. TRAI intervened after DTH operators complained that broadcasters were forcing them to carry channels that they did not want. In the Telecommunication (Broadcasting and Cable) Services (Second) <b>Tariff</b> (Eighth <b>Amendment)</b> Order, 2007 (a revision of the earlier regulation issued on October 4, 2007), broadcasters were ordered to offer all channels on an a la carte basis to cable providers. Like the earlier regulation concerning DTH operators, this order took effect on December 1, 2007. It also permitted packages to be offered along with a la carte.|$|R
