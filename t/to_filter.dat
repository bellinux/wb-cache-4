5|$|Marine mammals {{have evolved}} {{a wide variety}} of {{features}} for feeding, which are mainly seen in their dentition. For example, the cheek teeth of pinnipeds and odontocetes are specifically adapted to capture fish and squid.

5|$|Surface feeders that swim {{often have}} unique bills as well, adapted for their {{specific}} prey. Prions have special bills with filters called lamellae <b>to</b> <b>filter</b> out plankton from mouthfuls of water, and many albatrosses and petrels have hooked bills to snatch fast-moving prey. Gulls have more generalised bills that reflect their more opportunistic lifestyle.|$|E
40|$|A rapid, simple, and {{quantitative}} filter-binding assay using glass fiber filters {{has been developed}} to detect the convalent adenovirus DNA-terminal protein complex. The assay is unusually sensitive because binding of protein-free DNA generally is less than 0. 1 %. Binding of the adenovirus complex <b>to</b> <b>filters</b> is mediated by terminal protein. We have found that: (i) the adenovirus complex binds maximally <b>to</b> <b>filters</b> in NaCl at concentrations higher than 0. 2 M; (ii) noncovalent complexes between protein-free DNA and adenovirus proteins bind <b>to</b> <b>filters</b> in salt at concentrations lower than 0. 4 M but not in concentrations higher than 0. 7 M; and (iii) protein-free DNA alone binds <b>to</b> <b>filters</b> in guanidine. hydrochloride at concentrations higher than 0. 8 M. By varying the ionic conditions, "all or none" modulation of these interactions can be achieved...|$|R

5|$|A {{common theme}} {{throughout}} Zobel's {{work is the}} issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach <b>to</b> <b>filter</b> design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.|$|E

5|$|Cetaceans {{are divided}} into two parvorders: the largest parvorder, Mysticeti (baleen whales), is {{characterized}} by the presence of baleen, a sieve-like structure in the upper jaw made of keratin, which it uses <b>to</b> <b>filter</b> plankton, among others, from the water; Odontocetes (toothed whales) are characterized by bearing sharp teeth for hunting, as opposed to their counterparts' baleen.|$|E

5|$|There are two kidneys located dorsally, {{near the}} roof of the body cavity. Their job is <b>to</b> <b>filter</b> the blood of {{metabolic}} waste and transport the urine via ureters to the urinary bladder where it is stored before being passed out periodically through the cloacal vent. Larvae and most aquatic adult amphibians excrete the nitrogen as ammonia in large quantities of dilute urine, while terrestrial species, with a greater need to conserve water, excrete the less toxic product urea. Some tree frogs with limited access to water excrete most of their metabolic waste as uric acid.|$|E

To complete the serial for DVD, the episode was manually colourised by Stuart Humphryes and Peter Crocker – thereby returning the final Pertwee episode to its original colour presentation.|$|E
5|$|When {{neutrophils}} {{release their}} granule contents in the kidney, {{the contents of}} the granule (reactive oxygen compounds and proteases) degrade the extracellular matrix of host cells and can cause damage to glomerular cells, affecting their ability <b>to</b> <b>filter</b> blood and causing changes in shape. In addition, phospholipase products (e.g., leukotrienes) intensify the damage. This release of substances promotes chemotaxis of more neutrophils to the site of infection, and glomerular cells can be damaged further by the adhesion molecules during the migration of neutrophils. The injury done to the glomerular cells can cause renal failure.|$|E
5|$|Zobel and Carson {{helped to}} {{establish}} the nature of noise in electric circuits, concluding that—contrary to mainstream belief—it is not even theoretically possible <b>to</b> <b>filter</b> out noise entirely and that noise {{will always be a}} limiting factor in what is possible to transmit. Thus, they anticipated the later work of Claude Shannon, who showed how the theoretical information rate of a channel is related to the noise of the channel.|$|E

5|$|Analogue filters {{have played}} an {{important}} part in the development of electronics. Especially in the field of telecommunications, filters have been of crucial importance in a number of technological breakthroughs and have been the source of enormous profits for telecommunications companies. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that the early development of filters was intimately connected with transmission lines. Transmission line theory gave rise <b>to</b> <b>filter</b> theory, which initially took a very similar form, and the main application of filters was for use on telecommunication transmission lines. However, the arrival of network synthesis techniques greatly enhanced the degree of control of the designer.|$|E
5|$|Balaenids rely {{on their}} huge heads, {{as opposed to the}} rorquals' throat pleats, to feed effectively. This feeding {{behavior}} allows them to grow very big and bulky, without the necessity for a streamlined body. They have callosities, unlike other whales, {{with the exception of the}} bowhead whale. Rorquals have a higher proportion of muscle tissue and tend to be negatively buoyant, whereas right whales have a higher proportion of blubber and are positively buoyant. Gray whales are easily distinguished from other extant cetaceans by their sleet-gray color, dorsal ridges (knuckles on the back), and their gray-white scars left from parasites. As with the rorquals, their throat pleats increase the capacity of their throats, allowing them <b>to</b> <b>filter</b> larger volumes of water at once. Gray whales are bottom-feeders, meaning they sift through sand to get their food. They usually turn on their sides, scoop up sediment into their mouths and filter out benthic creatures like amphipods, which leave noticeable marks on their heads.|$|E
5|$|Distributed element {{filters are}} mostly used at {{frequencies}} above the VHF (Very High Frequency) band (30 to 300 MHz). At these frequencies, the physical length of passive components {{is a significant}} fraction of the wavelength of the operating frequency, and it becomes difficult to use the conventional lumped element model. The exact point at which distributed element modelling becomes necessary depends on the particular design under consideration. A common {{rule of thumb is}} to apply distributed element modelling when component dimensions are larger than 0.1λ. The increasing miniaturisation of electronics has meant that circuit designs are becoming ever smaller compared to λ. The frequencies beyond which a distributed element approach <b>to</b> <b>filter</b> design becomes necessary are becoming ever higher {{as a result of these}} advances. On the other hand, antenna structure dimensions are usually comparable to λ in all frequency bands and require the distributed element model.|$|E
