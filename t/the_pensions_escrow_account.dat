40|$|Conrad ReportApproved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. MBA Professional ReportEffective {{execution of the}} Department of the Navy's (DoN) budget is critical for national defense. However, political instability and the evolving demands placed upon the Navy and Marine Corps team present challenges in the execution and future planning of DoN budgets. In the current budgetary system, shortfalls are typically funded through targeted cuts while the methodologies for recapitalizing cost savings are non-existent. The proposed Navy <b>escrow</b> <b>account</b> provides a buffer for rapidly shifting requirements and budgetary shortfalls. It creates an incentive for generating cost savings {{and the means to}} redistribute those savings toward emergent financial demands or unfunded requirements. This study outlines critical factors in creating and maintaining a Navy <b>escrow</b> <b>account.</b> Specifically, it addresses: 1) the proposed operation and functioning of the Navy <b>escrow</b> <b>account</b> 2) barriers to implementation including legal restrictions and potential congressional and Department of Defense (DoD) resistance; and 3) proposed implementation strategies including the required cultural modifications and techniques for effectively managing the change process associated with the creation of an <b>escrow</b> <b>account</b> mechanism.

5000|$|On May 20, 2010, Roger Barack {{announced}} that he had sold the bridge to Advanced Explosives Demolition (AED), a demolition company that has gained fame through their demolitions on the TLC reality show The Imploders, for USD 1. AED then sold the bridge to KDC Investments for USD 25,000, finalizing the deal on June 3, 2010. [...] AED will be subcontracted to complete the demolition, with Delta Demolition, a local company, serving as the general contractor. The project originally was to be completed by September 28, 2010, but as has been historically typical with the bridge, delays have pushed the demolition back from a target of June 2011 to being indefinitely placed on hold. The current delay stems from disagreement between the contractor and Benwood, West Virginia officials over an <b>escrow</b> <b>account</b> being created to ensure demolition is completed once started. A Federal Court has ordered that the <b>escrow</b> <b>account</b> be in place by June 20, 2013, and the bridge be demolished within 8 months of the formation of the <b>escrow</b> <b>account.</b> The contractor faces a USD $1,000 per day fine for not meeting these conditions.|$|R
