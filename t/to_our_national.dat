500|$|In an October 26, 2009, {{interview}} with the Santa Fe New Mexican's Steve Terrell, Johnson announced his decision to form an advocacy committee called the Our America Initiative to help him raise funds and promote small government ideas. In December 2009, Johnson asked strategist Ron Nielson of NSON Opinion Strategy, {{who has worked with}} Johnson since 1993 when he ran his successful gubernatorial campaign, to organize the Our American Initiative as a 501(c)(4) committee. Nielson serves as a senior advisor to Our America Initiative. The stated focus of the organization is to [...] "speak out on issues regarding topics such as government efficiency, lowering taxes, ending the war on drugs, protecting civil liberties, revitalizing the economy and promoting entrepreneurship and privatization". The move prompted speculation among media pundits and Johnson's supporters that he might be laying the groundwork for a 2012 presidential run. Throughout 2010, Johnson repeatedly deflected questions about a 2012 presidential bid by saying his 501(c)(4) status prevented him from expressing a desire to run for federal office on politics. However, he was outspoken about the issues affecting the country, particularly [...] "the size and cost of government" [...] and the [...] "deficits and debt that truly threaten to consume the U.S. economy, and which represent the single greatest threat <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>national</b> security." ...|$|E

2500|$|By {{the summer}} of 2009, there was {{considerable}} analysis and speculation in the media {{of what kind of}} role and level of influence Clinton had within the Obama administration, with a variety of assessments being produced. A prominent mid-July speech to the Council on Foreign Relations reasserted her role; she said, [...] "We cannot be afraid or unwilling to engage.

2500|$|IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei {{criticized the}} strikes and deplored that {{information}} regarding the matter had not been shared with his agency earlier.

2500|$|In 2010, {{a lawsuit}} filed in 2004 by the Log Cabin Republicans (LCR), the nation's largest Republican gay organization, went to trial. Challenging the {{constitutionality}} of DADT, the plaintiffs stated that the policy violates the rights of gay military members to free speech, due process and open association. The government argued that DADT was necessary to advance a legitimate governmental interest. Plaintiffs introduced statements by President Barack Obama, from prepared remarks, that DADT [...] "doesn't contribute <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>national</b> security", [...] "weakens our national security", and that reversal is [...] "essential for our national security". According to plaintiffs, these statements alone satisfied their burden of proof on the due process claims.|$|E

2500|$|Kellor, {{speaking}} for the NAC in 1916, proposed to combine efficiency and patriotism in her Americanization programs. It would be more efficient, she argued, once the factory workers could all understand English and therefore better understand orders and avoid accidents. Once Americanized, they would grasp American industrial ideals and be open to American influences and not subject only to strike agitators or foreign propagandists. The result, she argued would transform indifferent and ignorant residents into understanding voters, to make their homes into American homes, and to establish American standards of living throughout the ethnic communities. Ultimately, she argued it would [...] "unite foreign-born and native alike in enthusiastic loyalty <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>national</b> ideals of liberty and justice.|$|E

2500|$|Live {{explosives}} and gunfire were only {{used on a}} small portion of the island—the live impact area, which is located over eight miles from the nearest town. [...] Although areas that were used decades ago for burning expired ammunition take up less than 300 acres (1.2km²) and thus likely do not pose a serious health risk, the Navy has agreed to clean up the sites according to EPA standards. [...] Furthermore, no civilians were ever hit by Navy fire. At a press conference in 2001 the Honorable Robert B. Pirie, Under Secretary of the Navy, said that: “Our training poses no danger and little burden to Viequenses and is absolutely vital <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>national</b> security.”.|$|E
2500|$|A {{lawsuit filed}} by LCR in federal court {{challenging}} the [...] "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" [...] (DADT) policy, which excludes homosexuals from openly serving in the U. S. military, went to trial on July 13, 2010, presided by Judge Virginia Phillips. LCR argued that the policy violates the rights of homosexual military members to free speech, due process and open association. The government argued that DADT was necessary to advance a legitimate governmental interest. LCR introduced several admissions by President Barack Obama, including that DADT [...] "doesn't contribute <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>national</b> security," [...] "weakens our national security," [...] and that reversing DADT is [...] "essential for our national security". Rather than address plaintiff's claims or bring evidence to support their own claims of national interest, the government relied exclusively on the policy's 1993 legislative history.|$|E
2500|$|On April 23, 2015, the Armenian Apostolic Church held a {{ceremony}} {{outside of the}} Etchmiadzin Cathedral in Vagharshapat to canonize {{the victims of the}} Armenian Genocide. [...] The ceremony was held to coincide with the start of the killings, ending at the symbolic time of 19:15 with a bell ringing 100 times. Armenian churches around the world likewise rang a bell 100 times at 19:15 local time. The ceremony, which created around 1.5 million new saints, was the first canonization by the church in 400 years. Catholicos Karekin II remarked, [...] "The canonization of the martyrs of the genocide brings life-giving new breath, grace and blessing <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>national</b> and ecclesiastical life. The blood of the Armenian martyred for Christ has placed the seal of unshakeable faith and patriotism on the sands of the desert".

2500|$|He {{also warned}} that Copts who visited Jerusalem would face excommunication {{on the premise}} that there was [...] "no pilgrimage duty in Christianity and it is not a {{religious}} pillar, so since this visit can do harm <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>national</b> cause and [...] Muslim and Christian people then we better not visit Jerusalem." [...] He added that Copts should only go to Jerusalem after peace was established in the region. Some of the Coptic property within the compound of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre (including the Coptic monastery known as Deir El-Sultan) was delegated to the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Upon the application of some bishops, the Coptic Orthodox Holy Synod, based on the direction of Pope Shenouda III, also decided to ask Copts not to visit Jerusalem until the Church possessions and the monastery be returned. In 2006, the Holy Synod renewed the decree, urging Copts not to visit the Christian holy places in Israel, including Jerusalem.|$|E
