5|$|Attack by the ant Crematogaster laeviuscula is {{different}} from attacks by birds. Rather than knocking down the nest, <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> swarm all over the nest and remove the brood from it. <b>The</b> <b>ants</b> destroy the entire brood but {{they are unable to}} kill the adults.|$|E
5|$|In The Ant and the Grasshopper, a {{grasshopper}} squanders {{the spring}} and summer months on singing while <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> put food away for the winter; when winter comes, the hungry grasshopper begs <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> for food, but <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> turn him away. Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft hit on the notion that the grasshopper could just take the food. After Stanton had completed a draft of the script, he came to doubt one of the story's main pillars – that the Circus Bugs that had come to the colony to cheat <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> would instead stay and fight. He thought the Circus Bugs were unlikable characters as liars and that it was unrealistic for them to undergo a complete personality change. Also, no particularly good reason existed for Circus Bugs to stay with the ant colony during the second act. Although the film was already far along, Stanton concluded that the story needed a different approach.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecophilous (ant-loving) {{caterpillars}} of {{the butterfly}} family Lycaenidae (e.g., blues, coppers, or hairstreaks) are herded by <b>the</b> <b>ants,</b> led to feeding {{areas in the}} daytime, and brought inside the ants' nest at night. The caterpillars have a gland which secretes honeydew when <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> massage them. Some caterpillars produce vibrations and sounds that are perceived by <b>the</b> <b>ants.</b> A similar adaptation {{can be seen in}} Grizzled skipper butterflies that emit vibrations by expanding their wings in order to communicate with ants, which are natural predators of these butterflies. Other caterpillars have evolved from ant-loving to ant-eating: these myrmecophagous caterpillars secrete a pheromone that makes <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> act as if the caterpillar is one of their own larvae. The caterpillar is then taken into the ant nest where it feeds on the ant larvae.|$|E
50|$|At first {{consideration}} {{it seems}} that <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> will never {{reach the end of}} the rope, but in fact it does (although in the form stated above the time taken is colossal). Whatever the length of the rope and the relative speeds of <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> and <b>the</b> stretching, providing <b>the</b> <b>ant's</b> speed and <b>the</b> stretching remain steady <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> will always be able to reach the end given sufficient time. Once <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> has begun moving, the rubber rope is stretching both in front of and behind <b>the</b> <b>ant,</b> conserving <b>the</b> proportion of the rope already walked by <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> and enabling <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> to make continual progress. This is similar to the paradox of Achilles and the tortoise.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ANT</b> itself {{received}} few royalties for Anna Lucasta and <b>the</b> {{next three}} <b>ANT</b> plays {{to appear on}} Broadway were not successful. Despite this, following the success of Anna Lucasta <b>the</b> <b>ANT</b> became less community-centered. From then on, <b>the</b> <b>ANT</b> only featured plays from established white playwrights, and young actors viewed <b>the</b> <b>ANT</b> {{as a means to}} break into Broadway productions.|$|R
50|$|The key {{fact is that}} <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> moves {{together}} with the points of the rope when the rope is being stretched. At any given point of time we can find {{the proportion of the}} distance from the starting-point to the target-point which <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> has covered. Even if <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> stops and <b>the</b> rope continues to be stretched, this proportion will not decrease and will in fact remain constant as <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> travels {{together with}} the point on the rope where <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> stopped (because <b>the</b> rope is stretched uniformly). Therefore, if <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> moves forward this proportion is only going to increase.|$|R

5|$|After rescuing the Queen, Flik deploys the bird; it {{initially}} fools the grasshoppers, but P.T. Flea, also mistaking {{it for a}} real bird, burns it, exposing it as a decoy. Hopper beats Flik {{in retaliation}} and says that <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> are humble and lowly life forms who live to serve the grasshoppers. However, Flik responds that Hopper actually fears the colony, because he has always known what they are capable of, inspiring <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> and the Circus Bugs to fight back against the grasshoppers. <b>The</b> <b>ants</b> attempt to force Hopper out of Ant Island, but it suddenly begins to rain. In the ensuing chaos, Hopper kidnaps Flik and flees. After the Circus Bugs fail to catch them, Atta rescues Flik. As Hopper pursues them, Flik lures him to the nest of the bird he, Dot, and the Circus Bugs encountered earlier. Thinking that the bird is another decoy, Hopper taunts it before discovering it is real, and is captured and fed to its chicks.|$|E

5|$|Meat ants {{are among}} the very few native species of Australia that are not harmed by the toxins of the cane toad, an {{invasive}} species. Most of the time, foraging workers target metamorph toads. Observations show that workers would forage around ponds and seize any toadlet. This normally starts with a single worker making contact with an individual and tracing its movements, followed by three or four workers capturing it. All the participating ants would grab a limb and sever the legs, returning the prey item back to their nest. Most of the time these tactics do not work. For example, most toadlets are able to escape <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> by displaying aversion-like behaviour; an individual may escape by struggling erratically or forcing <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> to release their grip by returning to the water. This aversion behaviour leads to most toadlets remaining in the water or staying on objects such as water lilies, pieces of bark that <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> cannot access, or moving around on moist substrates. It is unknown if meat ant predation on the toadlets affected the population, but based on the population density of the toadlets within the studied site and the foraging time and efficiency, approximately 2,700 toadlets could be removed per day. As the toadlet population density is extremely high, the impact of meat ant predation is minor. However, the survivability of the toadlets may be affected if <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> prevent the toadlets from foraging into many areas of moist substrate.|$|E
5|$|Some larvae, {{especially}} those of the Lycaenidae, form mutual associations with ants. They communicate with <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> using vibrations that are transmitted through the substrate as well as using chemical signals. <b>The</b> <b>ants</b> provide some degree of protection to these larvae and they in turn gather honeydew secretions. Large blue (Phengaris arion) caterpillars trick Myrmica ants into taking {{them back to the}} ant colony where they feed on the ant eggs and larvae in a parasitic relationship.|$|E

5|$|Tatuidris, or {{armadillo}} ant, {{is a rare}} genus of ants {{consisting of}} a single species, Tatuidris tatusia. <b>The</b> <b>ants</b> are small in size and inhabit the leaf litter of Neotropical forests in Central and South America, from Mexico to Brazil. Workers are ferruginous-colored to dark red and present a distinctive morphology, consisting of a shield-like head with a broad vertex, ventrally-turned heavy mandibles which do not overlap at full closure, and unique among ants– an antenna socket apparatus sitting upside-down.

5|$|The wasps are a {{cosmopolitan}} paraphyletic grouping {{of hundreds of}} thousands of species, consisting of the narrow-waisted Apocrita without <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> and bees. The Hymenoptera also contain the somewhat wasplike but unwaisted Symphyta, the sawflies.|$|E
50|$|The fungus then kills <b>the</b> <b>ant,</b> and {{continues}} to grow as its hyphae invade more soft tissues and structurally fortify <b>the</b> <b>ant's</b> exoskeleton. More mycelia then sprout out of <b>the</b> <b>ant,</b> and securely anchor it to the plant substrate while secreting antimicrobials to ward off competition. When the fungus is ready to reproduce, its fruiting bodies grow from <b>the</b> <b>ant's</b> head and rupture, releasing the spores. This process takes four to ten days.|$|R

50|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> {{shape is}} {{unlikely}} to deceive an <b>ant,</b> <b>the</b> spider does hunt <b>ants.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ant</b> form is therefore probably to evade predators that would eat spiders, but not ants.|$|R
5|$|Behavioral ecologists {{have found}} {{its role as}} a brood {{parasite}} to be of particular interest as, unlike many brood parasites, it does not directly oviposit in the hosts' nests. The P. rebeli parasitizes the colony ant species Myrmica schencki as a larva by using chemical mimicry to trick <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> into believing that they are ant larvae; thus, <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> bring the P. rebeli larvae back to their own nests and feed them. It also parasitizes the food plant Gentiana cruciata early in its life cycle, but in turn, is parasitized by the Ichneumon eumerus when it is in the M. schencki nest. It was placed on the IUCN Red List in 2000 and is classified as a species 'vulnerable' to extinction. Although a separate species from the P. alcon, its DNA genome and appearance are extremely similar, leading many researchers to argue that any differences between the two species are due to intraspecific variation.|$|E
5|$|Flies in the Old World genus Bengalia (Calliphoridae) prey on ants and are kleptoparasites, {{snatching}} prey or brood {{from the}} mandibles of adult ants.

5|$|Formica polyctena, {{among other}} ant species, {{constructs}} nests that maintain a relatively constant interior temperature that {{aids in the}} development of larvae. <b>The</b> <b>ants</b> maintain the nest temperature by choosing the location, nest materials, controlling ventilation and maintaining the heat from solar radiation, worker activity and metabolism, and in some moist nests, microbial activity in the nest materials.|$|E
50|$|Research {{shows that}} <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> can strip {{nutrients}} from agricultural plants, which increases crop susceptibility to disease and other herbivorous insect pests.

50|$|However, {{though it}} doesn't seem clear at first, <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> will always {{reach the end}} of the rope, no matter <b>the</b> <b>ant's</b> speed or <b>the</b> speed of the rope's expansion. This can be {{reasoned}} by the following. Assuming the typical form of the puzzle mentioned above, <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> moves 1 cm/s. As a figurative example, let's say <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> has covered 1/1000 of the rope after one second. In the second second, <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> moves <b>the</b> same distance, but it is smaller compared {{to the size of the}} rope. Let's say this is 1/2000. This will continue for a long time, with <b>the</b> <b>ant's</b> distance covered in a second decreasing relative to the length of the rope. That means our fraction will continue getting smaller. However, if we add all these fractions up, we will get a part of the harmonic series, which diverges. This means in <b>the</b> end, <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> will get to the end of the rope, even though it will take an exceedingly long time.|$|R

5|$|It {{was once}} {{suggested}} {{that the relationship between}} the obligate and regular ant-followers and the army ants, particularly Eciton burchellii, was mutualistic, with <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> benefiting by having the birds chase prey back down towards them. However, experiments where ant followers were excluded have shown that the foraging success of the army ants was 30% lower when the birds were present, suggesting that the birds' relationship was in fact parasitic. This has resulted in a number of behaviours by <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> in order to reduce kleptoparasitism, including hiding of secured prey in the leaf litter and caching of food on trails. It has been {{suggested that the}} depressive effect of this parasitism slows the development of E. burchellii swarms and in turn benefits other ant species which are preyed upon by army ants. The ant-following antbirds are themselves followed by three species of butterfly in the family Ithomiinae which feed on their droppings. Bird droppings are usually an unpredictable resource in a rainforest, but the regular behaviour of ant followers makes the exploitation of this resource possible.|$|E
5|$|Jack jumper ants are {{abundant}} {{in most of}} Australia, being among the most common bull ant to be encountered. <b>The</b> <b>ants</b> {{can be found in}} the south-western tip of Western Australia, where it has been seen in the sand hills around Albany, Mundaring, Denmark and Esperance. The ant is rarely sighted in the northern regions of Western Australia. In South Australia, it is commonly found in the south-east regions of the state, frequently encountered in Mount Lofty (particularly the Adelaide Hills), Normanville, Hallett Cove and Aldgate, but it is not found in north-western regions. There are dense populations on the western seaboard of Kangaroo Island. Jack jumpers are widespread throughout the whole of Victoria, but the species is uncommon in Melbourne. However, populations have been collected from the suburb of Elsternwick, and they are commonly found in the Great Otway Ranges, with many nests observed around Gellibrand. In New South Wales, nests are found throughout the entire state (with the exception of north-western New South Wales), but dense populations are mostly found in the Snowy Mountains, Blue Mountains and coastal regions. <b>The</b> <b>ants</b> are widespread in the Australian Capital Territory. In Queensland, <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> are only found along the south-eastern coastlines of the state, where populations are frequently encountered in the Bunya Mountains, Fletcher, Stanthorpe, Sunshine Coast, Tamborine Mountain and Millmerran, and have been found as far north as Rockhampton.
