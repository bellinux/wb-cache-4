5|$|According to Lafcadio Hearn, a {{butterfly}} {{was seen in}} Japan as the personification of a person's soul; whether they be living, dying, or already dead. One Japanese superstition says that if {{a butterfly}} enters your guest room and perches behind the bamboo screen, the person whom you most love is coming to see you. Large numbers of butterflies are viewed as bad omens. When Taira no Masakado was secretly preparing for his famous revolt, <b>there</b> <b>appeared</b> in Kyoto so vast a swarm of butterflies that the people were frightened— thinking the apparition to be a portent of coming evil.|$|E

5|$|American {{intelligence}} analysts were quite baffled by {{this series of}} enemy actions. For them <b>there</b> <b>appeared</b> to be no logic behind the sustained NVA/NLF offensives, other than to inflict casualties on the allied forces. This they accomplished, but the casualties absorbed by the North Vietnamese seemed to negate any direct gains they might have obtained. The border battles did, however, have two significant consequences that were unappreciated at the time—they fixed {{the attention of the}} American command on the border regions and they drew American and ARVN forces away from the coastal lowlands and cities, in preparation for the Tet Offensive.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the penalty was taken, the Welsh dugout was {{surrounded}} by press and photographers, as the home team were still leading 1–0. With the scores levelled, the pack switched {{their attention to the}} Scottish bench, which led to Stein remonstrating with at least one photographer {{to move out of the}} way of his view of the game. Both Professor Stewart Hillis, the Scotland team doctor (who was also Stein's consultant), and Welsh manager Mike England stated that <b>there</b> <b>appeared</b> to be nothing wrong at this point.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{now having}} {{established}} a taxonomic grouping for the Liliaceae family that is genetically monophyletic, {{compared to the}} prior longstanding polyphyletic assemblages under this name, the morphology remains diverse, and there exists within the Liliaceae clade a number of subclades. <b>There</b> <b>appeared</b> to be two major clades, the first and largest of these consisted of three subclades: Clintonia—Medeola—Gagea, Lilium Fritillaria—Notholirion, and Tulipa—Erythronium. The second smaller clade, Streptopus—Tricyrtis contained elements of Dahlgren's Uvulariaceae. The position of Calochortus remained problematic, being considered a sister clade to Liliaceae, as treated by Tamura, but further analysis suggested {{it was in fact}} sister to Tricyrtis, although it is now considered separate once again (see Table 3).|$|E

5|$|Even if without direct predation, {{the giant}} otter must still {{compete with other}} predators for food resources. Duplaix {{documented}} interaction with the neotropical otter. While the two species are sympatric (with overlapping ranges) during certain seasons, <b>there</b> <b>appeared</b> to be no serious conflict. The smaller neotropical otter is far more shy, less noisy, and less social; at about a third {{the weight of the}} giant otter, it is more vulnerable to predation, hence, a lack of conspicuousness is to its advantage. The neotropical otter is active during twilight and darkness, reducing the likelihood of conflict with the diurnal giant otter. Its smaller prey, different denning habits, and different preferred water types also reduce interaction.|$|E
5|$|Miller noted <b>there</b> <b>appeared</b> {{to be two}} colour forms {{reported}} {{across its}} range, namely a more cream-coloured form with darker shades of brown and grey in its cap that darkens with age, and a more wholly brownish form with paler edges and darker centre to its cap. He found the cream-coloured form to be strongly luminescent—the brightest of any fungus in the genus—with the cap, stipe and gills all glowing. The brown form was generally fainter, with its luminescence restricted to the gills. However, some strongly luminescent wholly brown-coloured mushrooms were recorded, and laboratory experiments showed all interbred freely and produced fertile offspring, leading Miller to conclude that these were phenotypic variants of a single taxon.|$|E
5|$|While {{experimenting with}} the {{products}} of radioactive decay, in 1913 radiochemist Frederick Soddy discovered that <b>there</b> <b>appeared</b> {{to be more than}} one type of atom at each position on the periodic table. The term isotope was coined by Margaret Todd as a suitable name for different atoms that belong to the same element. J.J. Thomson created a technique for separating atom types through his work on ionized gases, which subsequently led to the discovery of stable isotopes.|$|E

But Nebraska received the kickoff at its 24-yard line and returned it to the Nebraska 42. Frost attempted a long pass to get Nebraska into position for a field goal attempt, but the throw fell incomplete. Instead of trying another long pass, Nebraska proceeded to run out the clock, and the Cornhuskers went into halftime with a 1714 lead.|$|E
5|$|Christian metal soon {{developed}} {{into its own}} independent record labels and networks. The first Christian metal label was Pure Metal Records, a sublabel of Refuge Records. Soon <b>there</b> <b>appeared</b> other labels such as R.E.X. Records and Intense Records. Fanzines were published in several countries, with Heaven's Metal as {{the first one in}} the US in 1985. During that time almost every Christian record label became interested in Christian metal, and they advertised the newly signed metal bands on their roster on Heaven's Metal since it was the only publication exclusively covering the movement. Soon Heaven's Metal achieved more popularity and became an official, professional publication. Heaven's Metal achieved a dedicated flock of 15,000 readers. Bands' sales usually rose when the ensembles were covered on the magazine. During the 1980s and early 1990s, the more underground Christian metal releases were typically distributed in Christian bookstores, and those as well as the fanzines also traded Christian metal cassette copies with the music fans.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{fell across}} the Dominican Republic, with isolated totals of 10inches (250mm) expected. The rainfall caused flooding along the Yaque del Norte River, and initially <b>there</b> <b>appeared</b> to {{be a threat}} that the Tavera Dam along the river would fail, potentially killing thousands in Santiago Province. Officials instead opted to open all six floodgates at 0400UTC on December 12, which released about 1.6milliongallons (6.1millionliters) of water into the river every second. The deluge created a 66foot (20m) wave of water that caught many off guard due to the time of night and only about 15minutes to prepare, according to eyewitnesses who criticized the decision; the flooding killed at least 35people and left homes in seven towns flooded. Two other deaths were reported elsewhere in the country, and more than 34,000people fled their homes due to the storm; more than 7,500houses were damaged. Damage in the country was estimated at $1.5billion (2007DOP, $45million 2007USD). In neighboring Haiti, two deaths were reported in the northern portion of the country. On December 11, a station in the Turks and Caicos Islands recorded sustained winds of 36mph (58km/h).|$|E

5|$|Members of {{the public}} commented that {{although}} some events were sold out, <b>there</b> <b>appeared</b> to be many unoccupied seats at venues, and claimed that this was because the Ministry of Education (MOE) made a block purchase of 87,000 passes {{to be given to}} schools. However, students usually did not stay for the full duration of sessions, which can be up to seven hours long. The MOE denied that students were to blame, stating that more than 95% of students allocated tickets had attended events, and that some schools had asked to purchase additional tickets due to overwhelming demand. The SYOGOC announced that once sessions had begun, unoccupied seats would be resold to people who turned up in person at venues. To enable venue managers to gauge the number of seats available for resale, teachers escorting students to events were instructed to inform venue managers if they intended to leave before sessions ended and the number of seats occupied by students. On 20 August, the organisers reported that tickets were sold out for all 26 sports except girls' football.|$|E
5|$|The Shangani Patrol {{continued}} its approach {{during the late}} evening, and scouted close to the bush enclosure housing Lobengula. Captain William Napier repeatedly called to the king in the Matabele language, Sindebele, but received no reply from the Matabele leaders, who remained silent and hid themselves. The patrol's actions confused the Matabele, who could not understand why <b>there</b> <b>appeared</b> to be so few Company soldiers, nor why they would reveal their position like this. They concluded {{that it must be}} a trap, and were only satisfied that it was not when Wilson's men had stopped during their approach to call to Lobengula five times. Following the fifth call from Napier, Mjaan ordered his riflemen to gather around the patrol, intending to pocket it. Noticing this, Wilson ordered a retreat, and took up a well-covered position in the bush where he could hide until daybreak. When Lieutenant Hofmeyer and Troopers Bradburn and Colquhoun were lost amid the increasingly stormy night, Wilson briefly backtracked to recover them.|$|E
5|$|The {{subtropical}} {{storm had}} an unusual origin by forming from an interaction {{of two different}} systems near the Yucatán Peninsula. This occurrence is unusual, but not unique, as Subtropical Storm One in the 1974 season formed in similar pattern. A reconnaissance flight on June 17 reported that <b>there</b> <b>appeared</b> to be multiple transient circulations at the surface, but no well-defined center. The first disturbance {{can be traced back}} to June 15 in the northwest Caribbean Sea. The disturbance moved north, along with a low-pressure area that formed over the Yucatán Peninsula. A trough merged with the low-pressure area creating an even stronger trough over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Conditions in the Gulf of Mexico were favorable for tropical storm formation. Some severe weather had been occurring over the Florida Peninsula as early as June 16, as the fringes of disturbance moved across the Florida Straits and over the Peninsula.|$|E
