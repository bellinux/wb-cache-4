25|$|LGE did not {{challenge}} {{the claim that}} the intended and reasonable use of the microprocessor products was to incorporate them into computers, but it claimed that some noninfringing uses existed: they could be sold overseas, as repair parts, or by disabling the features that made them patented. The Court dismissed these arguments. As for disablement, the Court asserted that the disabled device aspects (“features”) rather than the device that remained must have a noninfringing use, so that disabling them would cause them to have “no real use.” As for foreign or replacement use, <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>test</b> to be looked to was whether the product would perform the patented method or embody the patented product, not whether the use gave rise to infringement liability.|$|E

2500|$|When pressed {{about this}} again later, some sharp exchanges resulted. Bisbee said [...] "the Court doesn't even {{really need to}} reach that question". [...] "Suppose we {{think we need to}} reach that decision" [...] he was told. [...] "e didn't take this case to {{determine}} who said what in the cafeteria. We determine this case to see what the rule of law ought to be if an employer acts on reasonable, substantiated information, but is wrong." [...] Bisbee suggested that the Seventh Circuit had perhaps used [...] "language that was broader than it needed to", to which O'Connor responded that it might need to be sent back since even he declined to defend their legal theory.

2500|$|Even if {{actual or}} imputed bias cannot be proved, an {{appearance}} of bias is sufficient for a judgment or decision to be set aside. <b>The</b> <b>legal</b> <b>test</b> for establishing apparent bias in Singapore {{has been the subject}} of some controversy. In the cases of Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v. Lee Kuan Yew (1992) and Tang Liang Hong v. Lee Kuan Yew (1997), the Court of Appeal stated that the test should be [...] "reasonable suspicion", that is, the court should ask itself whether [...] "a reasonable and fair-minded person sitting in court and knowing all the relevant facts [...] have a reasonable suspicion that a fair trial for the applicant was not possible". However, after a number of cases which established that a [...] "real likelihood" [...] test should be applied in the UK, the High Court in Tang Kin Hwa v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board (2005) expressed the obiter view that there was in fact no material difference between the two tests. In Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni (2006), a different High Court judge disagreed with this view, holding that the reasonable suspicion test is less stringent as it requires a lower standard of proof than satisfaction on a balance of probabilities. He expressed preference for the reasonable suspicion test over the real likelihood test. As of January 2013, the Court of Appeal had not yet ruled on the matter.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> {{and economic}} assessments applied to resolve WTO disputes requiring {{an assessment of}} the contribution of the measure to the objective pursued, along with identifying any reasonably available alternatives. It focuses on disputes encompassing an interpretation of GATT Article XX (b), Sanitary and PhytoSanitary Agreement (SPS) Article 5. 6 and the Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Agreement Article 2. 2. This narrow focus is because the WTO DSB has opined that there are {{no significant differences between the}} tests developed under Art. XX(b) of the GATT 1994 and Art. 5. 6 of the SPS Agreement, nor that any aspect of the Art. XX(b) jurisprudence relating to the interpretation of the term "necessary" would be inapplicable to Art. 2. 2 of the TBT Agreement. This provides an opportunity to compare <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> and economic assessments applied in disputes falling under these provisions. This paper identifies no significant differences between <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>tests</b> relating to <b>the</b> interpretation of the term "necessary". A WTO Panel is under no obligation to quantify the measure's contribution to the objective pursued and 'a risk may be evaluated either in quantitative or qualitative terms'. However, the same cannot be said for the economic assessments determining whether the necessity of the contribution of the contested measure. After setting out <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>tests,</b> <b>the</b> paper identifies those economic assessments undertaken to resolve disputes involving these three different GATT/WTO provisions. The paper finds that quantitative economic models are rarely employed in WTO dispute cases. The lack of coherent guidelines for assessing the economic dimensions of a dispute in a transparent and robust manner potentially undermines the effectiveness and the reputation of WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) recommendations...|$|R
