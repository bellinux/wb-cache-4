5|$|In September, Chaytor, {{commanding}} the ANZAC Mounted Division, was given command {{of a mixed}} mounted and infantry force {{to carry out a}} deception plan in the Jordan Valley. The regiment helped by constructing dummy camps with dummy horse lines and increased their patrolling, with the objective of discovering the Turkish strength and positions. The rest of the army was aligned to their left flank and on 19 September started the last attack major attack of the campaign. With the Turkish forces retiring to counter <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>in</b> the west, by 21 September the NZMRB was ordered forward, reinforced by two battalions of the British West Indies Regiment, their own Ayrshire Battery RHA and the 29th Indian Mountain Battery.|$|E
5|$|In {{the lead}} up to the assault on Musa Qaleh, members of the Brigade Reconnaissance Force {{provided}} vital intelligence for the upcoming operation.

5|$|Nevertheless, unbeknown {{to their}} commanders and each other, and having lost communications, the seven landing craft {{that had been}} {{reported}} missing made for their assigned beaches, determined to press on with <b>the</b> <b>attack.</b> <b>In</b> the end two parties landed, one party consisting of six craft carrying approximately 120 men under Captain R.L Willis landed on the beach opposite Le Petit Berneval {{to the east of}} the battery—Yellow I—while the other, consisting of only one craft of 20 men from No. 6 Troop under Captain Peter Young landed to the west at Yellow II.|$|E

5|$|On 1 February, Jirgalang {{announced}} that the Shunzhi Emperor, {{who was about to}} turn thirteen, would now assume full imperial authority. The regency was thus officially abolished.

Jirgalang continued to purge former members of Dorgon's clique and to bestow high ranks and nobility titles upon a growing number of followers in the Three Imperial Banners, so that by 1652 all of Dorgon's former supporters had been either killed or effectively removed from government.|$|E

5|$|Parker's murder led to {{increased}} racial tensions in Peterborough.

A number of taxi firms stopped work early {{in the days after}} <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>in</b> fear of reprisals. In November 2001 Home Secretary David Blunkett banned all marches in Peterborough for three months as it was feared violence would be caused by the Anti-Nazi League and National Front who both sought to hold protests on the same day.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{military}} {{conducted an}} intensive search for I-174 {{in the days}} after <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>in</b> the mistaken belief that she had been significantly damaged. This search was not successful and highlighted the unsatisfactory communications between the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF).

5|$|The Israeli embassy {{suffered}} {{a terrorist attack}} on March 17, 1992. It was perceived {{as a consequence of}} Argentina's involvement in the Gulf War.

Another hypothesis was that the attack could have been performed by Jewish extremists, in order to cast blame on Muslims and thwart the peace negotiations. The Court finally held Hezbollah responsible for <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>in</b> May 1999.|$|E

In 1941, Jones was serving with the US Army in Hawaii, {{at the time of}} Pearl Harbor, and the novel was loosely based on his {{experiences}} in the 27th Infantry Regiment. It focuses on the lives of a group of soldiers {{in the months leading up}} to <b>the</b> <b>attack,</b> <b>in</b> particular Private Prewiit, a boxer who no longer wants to fight having blinded an opponent, and Sergeant Milt Warden, who has an affair with the wife of his commanding officer.|$|E
5|$|The issue {{came back}} to life in February of the {{following}} year when, two days before Flores' birthday, Padilla reported being kidnapped and stabbed by two gunmen. Padilla received 57 shallow slashes from a dagger which did not put his life in danger, but he could have died from blood loss. Padilla blamed Flores for the stabbing and for an earlier attack {{in which he was}} allegedly beaten by men who warned him against criticizing the church leader. A church spokesman denied that the church or Flores had any involvement in the attack and suggested that Padilla may have orchestrated <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>in</b> a desperate attempt to authenticate his previous charges against the church.|$|E
5|$|After the new ball bowlers had {{finished}} their new ball spells, Bradman reverted to the slower bowlers, using run-saving, defensive field settings. Immediately thereafter, Bedser targeted Toshack and hit three consecutive fours and a two in one over. Bradman immediately removed the left-armer and replaced him with Johnson. The Australian captain set his infield rather deep, effectively allowing the batsmen to take easy singles. Bedser responded cautiously, surveying Johnson's off spin for one over, {{before going on}} <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>in</b> the next. He lofted Johnson into the leg side three times, yielding a six over long on and two fours, taking his score to 47. Bedser then hit a ball back to the bowler Loxton, which was almost caught, before reaching 50. Bradman also brought back a tired Miller to bowl medium pace off breaks, to no avail. England went to the lunch adjournment at 360/2, with Edrich on 76 and Bedser on 52. They had added 92 for the session, including 70 in the second hour. Lindwall {{had been the only}} bowler who caused much difficulty to the batsmen, particularly concerning Edrich, but the Englishmen dealt with his colleagues comfortably and Miller, nursing fitness concerns, was forced to bowl medium-paced off breaks.|$|E

5|$|At {{the second}} monument, the Tour of Flanders, BMC was noted to be {{bringing}} a strong squad, headed by Ballan and Hincapie. Burghardt and Van Avermaet went on <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>in</b> the early {{portions of the}} race, only to be brought back after a short while. When Fabian Cancellara put in {{an attack on the}} Leberg, the day's fourteenth cobbled climb, and quickly took a sizable time gap, it was the BMC team which organized the chase to bring him back. They placed four riders into a seven-rider chase group and succeeded in bringing Cancellara back, something which has usually not happened to him in classics races. A further two riders had remained {{at the head of the}} peloton, giving them six riders at the front of the race when Cancellara was caught. Cancellara put in another move on the Muur van Geraardsbergen and was followed only by Sylvain Chavanel and eventual race winner Nick Nuyens. Hincapie finished with the group 5 seconds back for sixth place on the day. Kristoff rode to seventh place in the sprinters' classic Scheldeprijs later in April, back of three-time winner Mark Cavendish.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the attack, Croatian President Franjo Tuđman was in the building, meeting Stjepan Mesić, then President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia, and Ante Marković, then Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, but none of them were injured in <b>the</b> <b>attack.</b> <b>In</b> {{immediate}} aftermath, Tuđman remarked that the attack was apparently meant to destroy the Banski dvori as the seat of the statehood of Croatia. Marković blamed Yugoslav Defence Secretary General Veljko Kadijević, who denied the accusation and suggested the event was staged by Croatia. The attack prompted international condemnation and consideration of economic sanctions against Yugoslavia. The presidential residence was immediately moved to the Presidential palace, which was formerly known as Villa Zagorje. The Banski dvori sustained significant damage, but repairs started only in 1995. The building later became the seat of the Croatian Government.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} {{enormous}} size, power and speed, adult blue whales have virtually no natural predators. There is one documented case in National Geographic Magazine {{of a blue}} whale being attacked by orcas off the Baja California Peninsula; the orcas were unable to kill the animal outright during their attack, but the blue whale sustained serious wounds and probably {{died as a result}} of them shortly after <b>the</b> <b>attack.</b> <b>In</b> March 2014, a pack of orcas harassed a blue whale off California, with one of them biting the tip of the blue whale's tail fluke. The blue whale attempted to tail slap the orca and fled at high speed. A similar incident happened on May 18, 2017 in Monterey Bay, with the orcas swimming in a line up to the blue whale's side. The blue whale fled and escaped. Orcas have virtually no chance against an adult blue whale, but may attack them on occasion anyway for their own enjoyment. Up to a quarter of the blue whales identified in Baja bear scars from orca attacks.|$|E
