5|$|In {{the early}} 16th century the Portuguese made {{commercial}} {{contacts with the}} town and established a commercial centre in 1554 CE. The Portuguese also conducted missionary enterprise here. In 1658, the Dutch made an agreement with King Vijaya Nayakkar of Thanjavur on 5 January 1662, by which ten villages were transferred from the Portuguese <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> — Nagapattinam Port, Puthur, Muttam, Poruvalancheri, Anthanappettai, Karureppankadu, AzhingiMangalam, Sangamangalam, Thiruthinamangalam, Manjakollai, Nariyankudi. Ten Christian churches and a hospital were built by the Dutch. They released Pagoda coins with the name Nagapattinam engraved in Tamil. As per agreement between the first Maratta King Egoji of Thanjavur and the Dutch, Naagapattinam and surrounding villages were handed over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> on 30 December 1676. In 1690, the capital of Dutch Coromandel changed from Pulicat to Nagapattinam.|$|E

5|$|Despite his pessimism {{expressed}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> {{government and}} the mandate {{he had been given}} to surrender the Army, General Winkelman awaited the outcome of events, avoiding actually capitulating until it was absolutely necessary. In this he was perhaps motivated by a desire to engage the opposing German troops for as long as possible, to assist the Allied war effort. In the early morning of 14 May, though the situation remained critical, a certain calm was evident in the Dutch Headquarters.|$|E

50|$|In Valdivia <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> begun <b>the</b> {{construction}} of a fort, nevertheless nearby Mapuches begun <b>to</b> distrust <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> and halted their delivery of food. <b>The</b> Mapuches begun <b>to</b> realize <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> had no plans of leaving and their search for gold caused suspicion. Mapuche chief Manqueante from Mariquina provided relief <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hungry <b>Dutch</b> in form of cattle. This relief was only temporarily since it was likely a farewell gift. In addition <b>to</b> this <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> did not find the gold mines they expected. In view of these problems on October 15 <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> took <b>the</b> decision <b>to</b> retreat to Mancera Island abandoning Valdivia. Before leaving, Manqueante was contacted by Herckmans {{to let him know}} <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> had intentions of returning to Valdivia with 1000 African slaves to take care of mining and agriculture <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> indigenous peoples free of forced labour. This promise was never fulfilled.|$|R
50|$|By {{a series}} of negotiations, Vergennes sought <b>to</b> secure <b>the</b> armed {{neutrality}} of the Northern European states, which was eventually achieved by Catherine II of Russia. Britain declared war against <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> Republic in an attempt <b>to</b> keep <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> from joining <b>the</b> League. Vergennes believed <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> were most valuable as neutrals, as they could supply France through the British blockade, than as allies. He briefly entertained {{the hope that the}} British war against <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> would provoke <b>the</b> Russians <b>to</b> enter <b>the</b> war against them, but Catherine declined <b>to</b> act. <b>The</b> <b>Dutch</b> entry into <b>the</b> war placed further strains on the French treasury, as they searched for finances <b>to</b> support <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> war effort.|$|R
5|$|During 1934 {{and early}} 1935, all feature films {{released}} in the Dutch East Indies had been produced by The Teng Chun, based on Chinese mythology or martial arts, and targeted at low-class audiences, generally ethnic Chinese. This situation {{was created by the}} Great Depression, which had led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> East Indies government collecting higher taxes, advertisers asking for more money, and cinemas selling tickets at lower prices; this ensured that there was a very low profit margin for local films. During this period cinemas in the country mainly showed Hollywood productions.|$|E
5|$|Following a short refit, Sydney sailed for Fremantle on 27 February, {{where she}} was {{assigned}} to escort and patrol tasks in the Indian Ocean.

5|$|In July 2008, the Netherlands {{announced}} it would evaluate Gripen NG together with four other competitors; in response, Saab offered 85 aircraft to the Royal Netherlands Air Force in August 2008.

On 13 January 2009, NRC Handelsblad claimed that, according to Swedish sources, Saab had offered to deliver 85 Gripens for €4.8billion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> Air Force, about 1billion euro cheaper than budgeted for the F-35.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} resist Dutch encroachments, Hasanuddin tried to gather {{each of the}} kingdom’s {{military}} powers <b>to</b> attack <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> East Indies Company collectively.

5|$|In {{the context}} of Anglophone music, the term Antillean music most {{commonly}} refers to Trinidad and Tobago, home to the well-known calypso style. Music author Peter Manuel, for example, treats all the Anglophone islands as a subject of Trinidadian calypso traditions, while using the title Music of the Lesser Antilles for Francophone Antillean music. Manuel also, like many authors, treats Suriname and Guyana as integral aspects of Caribbean music; due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> colonial history of both countries, they are often grouped with Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, other European powers {{had decided}} that it was not in their {{interest}} that any one power should dominate the Baltic Sea. After long negotiations, known as the first Concert of the Hague, England sent a large fleet of 43 ships with more than 2,000 cannons. The force did not directly participate in fighting but nevertheless sent a clear message <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> fleet patrolling the Danish waters. England worked hard to broker a peace, aided by France which also declared its willingness to help the Swedes if the Danes refused to negotiate.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September, Maurice {{gave the}} command of the ambush to his {{favourite}} commander, his cousin Philip of Nassau. Maurice instructed him to cross the Lippe river the following day at dawn, hide in a wood next to which the Spanish convoy was expected to pass, and fall on its guard. Maurice's goal was to seize the foraging convoy, separate it from the escort and lead it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> camp, thus forcing Mondragón to intervene with a larger force. Then, after the appearance of Mondragón with the main army, Nassau was to retreat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> camp, thus luring the Spanish army into an ambush. For his task, Nassau received {{the command of}} some 500 or 700 Dutch and English horsemen and was accompanied by his two brothers, Ernst Casimir and Ludwig Gunther, {{as well as several}} other Dutch officers, Count Ernst of Solms, Paul and Marcellus Bacx, and the English captains Nicholas Parker, Cutler and Robert Vere.|$|E

Mondragón's force comprised two Spanish tercios (under Luis de Velasco and Antonio de Zúñiga), an Irish regiment under William Stanley, a Swiss regiment and 1,300 cavalry under Juan de Córdoba, which, having crossed the Meuse at Venlo, were joined by Frederick van den Bergh's German regiment.|$|E
5|$|The French foreign minister, the comte de Vergennes, {{disapproved of}} Adams, so Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Jay, and Henry Laurens were {{appointed}} {{to collaborate with}} Adams; nevertheless, Jefferson {{did not go to}} Europe and Laurens was posted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> Republic. Jay, Adams, and Franklin played the major part in the final negotiations. Overruling Franklin and distrustful of Vergennes, Jay and Adams decided not to consult with France; instead, they dealt directly with the British commissioners.|$|E
