Identification of external parasites was done on 500 of each species of chicken, guinea fowls and turkeys. For the evaluation of the effects of external parasites on the productivity of poultry, 324 chicks that were 6 weeks of age were randomly divided into 12 groups of 27 chicks each. Four of the groups was assigned at random to receive a <b>treatment</b> <b>against</b> external <b>parasites</b> (ET), 4 other groups were similarly assigned to receive a <b>treatment</b> <b>against</b> external <b>parasites</b> and another <b>treatment</b> <b>against</b> internal <b>parasites</b> (EIT). The 4 remaining groups were not treated <b>against</b> <b>parasites</b> (NT). Two mice species Liperus gallinae and Monopon gallinae have been found on both chicken and turkeys while Goniodes gigas was the only mice species parasiting chicken. The lice Echidnophaga gallinacea and the tick Argas persicus have been found to parasite chicken. Results of productivity trial showed that mortality due to effects of external parasites amounted to 13. 9 % of non treated poultry. Live weight of male birds increased from the base line of 850 g of the non-treated birds by 9. 8 % (950164. 3 g) due to <b>treatment</b> <b>against</b> external <b>parasites</b> and by 44. 5 % (1250133. 1 g) due to <b>treatments</b> <b>against</b> both external and internal parasites.

40|$|Fish {{parasite}} {{communities have}} strong {{interactions with the}} environment, the host fish, and the aquatic invertebrate communities. Thus, factors directly involving their different life cycles, such as different host populations and environments, as well as seasonal fluctuations in water levels can cause different responses. The main factors structuring parasite communities may be the hydrodynamic variations, together with seasonal variations in the availability of infectious stages of parasites in the environment. The {{purpose of this study}} was therefore to investigate the influence of the rainy and dry seasons on parasite infracommunities in fish species in the Amazon River System of Brazil. Between October 2009 and April 2011, specimens of Colossoma macropomum and Colossoma macropomum x Piaractus brachypomushybrids (tambatinga) were examined for the presence of parasites. The parasite communities were similar in these two species that both showed aggregate dispersion, although the hybrid specimens were less parasitized. For both hosts, the Brillouin diversity, species richness, evenness and Berger-Parker dominance indices were similar in the rainy season and dry season, except that the Berger-Parker dominance index for the C. macropomum x P. brachypomushybrid was higher during the dry season. Ichthyophthirius multifiliis was the dominant parasite, followed by Piscinoodinium pillulare, in both hosts. However, C. macropomumhad a higher prevalence and abundance in the dry season, while in the C. macropomum x P. brachypomushybrid, only the I. multifiliis prevalence increased. The abundance of monogenean species (Anacanthorus spathulatus, Linguadactyloides brinkmanni, Mymarotheciumand Notozothecium janauachensis) was higher during the dry season in the gills of C. macropomum. Despite over dispersion of the lernaeid Perulernaea gamitanae, a seasonal pattern was seen only in the C. macropomum x P. brachypomushybrid, with higher prevalence in the rainy season. The low prevalence and abundance of the ectoparasites Tetrahymenasp., Trichodinasp. and Braga patagonica, as well as of the endoparasites Procamallalus (Spirocamallanus) inopinatus and Neoechinorhynchus buttnerae, were not affected by seasonality.

40|$|Many ACP {{countries}} are no w developing their production {{of tropical fruit}} in order to exploit the growing demand of European consumers for such exotic produce. But to compete on European markets, the commercial opportunities and constraints thatgovern the marketing of perishable exports must be fully understood. Less than a century ago, oranges were a special treat reserved for the Christmas stocking. Today, however, citrus fruit, bananas and pineapples are eaten throughout the year. Imports by EEC countries of other tropical fruit, such as avocados, kiwis and mangoes, have also grown dramatically {{over the last few}} years, and these are now consumed universally. This is partly the result of a growing familiarity with such fruit which an increasing number of consumers have tasted during their vacations under the sun. Mango imports are an example of this development. They increased by 89 % between 1983 and 1986. reaching 22, 000 t, and in Great Britain their imports jumped 36. 5 % for 1985 / 86 alone! More than 100, 000 t of avocados are now imported by EEC countries, an increase of 38 % since 1983. In France, the avocado has now replaced the pineapple as the number two tropical fruit after the banana, which remains ahead despite its decreasing sales. In fact. the banana has become a victim of its own success: now almost as common as the apple, it is no longer bought for its exotic value. Other fruits that were practically unknown in northern countries {{only a few years ago}} have begun to be heavily marketed. This is the case with papaya whose imports in France, while still modest, increased by 50 % in 1986. Lychees, limes, guavas and mangosteens are also nowadays allocated shelf space. Supply and demand To exploit this expanding market, ACP {{countries are}} among those that are trying to increase and diversify their exports. But the stiff competition that they face from Latin American and Mediterranean countries means that ACP suppliers cannot afford any mistakes. They must ensure regular shipments of high quality fruit in order to guarantee their place on European markets. For both foreign and domestic markets, improved production techniques must be accompanied by improved marketing. The mountains of mangoes left to rot in the Casamance region of Senegal, the avocados that end up being fed to pigs in western Cameroon, and the stacks of fruit refused entry into the EEC, all testify to the fact that increased production alone is not enough. Furthermore, the constraints imposed by transportation methods and consumer tastes have repercussions on agronomic choices. In many cases, transportation to distant countries or even to nearby cities remains the biggest obstacle to significant increases in production. Perishable fruit demands an efficient harvest, good packaging and prompt delivery. The amount that can be exported depends on the existence of well maintained roads air freight services or nearby ports. For most ACP countries, and notably land-locked countries like Burkina Faso and Mali, only direct air freight connections can be relied on. Unfortunately, the capacity of such services is often limited. Some producers, particularly those in Reunion and the Caribbean, have considerable potential to produce but are limited by poor export facilities. The same problem is faced by Guinea, which must improve its shipping capacities before increasing its fruit production. While maritime freight is less expensive, it is only feasible for large quantities. It also means that harvest dates as well as packaging and storing methods must be planned around the longer shipping periods. To help ensure success, all aspects of production, from the selection of varieties to final consumption, must be planned. This is exactly what was done for the fruit project started ten years ago in Burkina Faso. In addition to providing the domestic market with citrus fruit, papaya and mangoes, about one thousand small producers and a 1 65 -ha irrigated orchard now supply more than 15 % of the mangoes imported by France. Good co-ordination of harvests on-site packaging and rigorous export schedules (plus cash payments to farmers upon delivery) have all contributed to the success of this project. Once at the marketplace, equally intensive efforts must be continued in order to sell the fruit. This is more easily said than done, given the fact that tropical fruit is bought more for pleasure than for need. Consumers are the key Consumers themselves hold the key to expanded markets and attention must thus be focused on satisfying their tastes. Europeans judge fruit that they are less familiar with more on appearance than eating qualities. The colour, size and form of fruit all play a big role in their eyes. Furthermore, the first variety of a new fruit that arrives on the market becomes a standard that is subsequently very difficult to change. To sell well, mangoes must not only have a good texture and not smell of turpentine, but most importantly should be highly coloured. Despite its fine taste and good handling characteristics, the Amelie variety, a mango with a yellow-green skin that makes up most of the exports from West Africa, is not having much success with consumers who prefer the red skinned mango from Latin America. The production of such varieties has thus become an objective of agricultural research programmes in African countries wishing to expand their exports. From time to time, advertising campaigns are able to overcome consumer resistance based on habit or subjective intrepretations. There are problems in France with selling limes that tend to be more yellow than the green lemon (citron vert) as they are called in French. This forced many suppliers to provide limes that were so green that they were immature. Efforts are now being made to call a lime a lime in order to avoid disappointing francophone consumers whose language makes them think that limes should always be green. For similar reasons, people think that a Iychee must be red and a papava yellow. The size of fruit is also an important criterion. Avocados must not be too large and should preferably be shaped like a pear, following the example given by Israel, the largest exporter. While African avocadoes may taste better, they have practically been eliminated from the market because of their large size and poor handling characteristics. As for the papaya, it must also be of a small size as well as easy to ripen and keep. Varieties are now being studied which could meet these demands. Consistent standards vital Appearance apart, strict quality control is needed for fruit destined for export. Sub-standard produce can easily make new consumers change their mind about buying exotic fruit and it also makes importers question the reliability of their suppliers. In any event, once a market develops for a certain fruit, the EEC establishes strict standards that must be respected governing phytosanitary quality, size and packaging. Unfortunately, these standards are often based on the first variety of a fruit to be introduced or on those exported by the largest producers who control the market. This can cause problems for new or smaller producers. These standards are liable to rapid change as the market develops, and producer countries must keep abreast of such developments in order to provide the variety or fruit that stands the best chance of selling. Once such produce is established internationally attention must shift to long-term agronomic developments that can guarantee future sales. Extending the season Tropical fruit sells best during the northern winter when local produce is out of season. Papaya, which matures between November and May, thus has considerable potential in developed countries. Cote d'lvoire and, more recently Burkina Faso, are becoming major producers after Brazil. Lychee deliveries from Reunion, Mauritius and Madagascar are also well timed, arriving during the festive season. Unfortunately, their production period is very short (late November to December), and this has led to efforts to develop varieties that can be harvested over a longer period. Meanwhile, the EEC has authorized sulphurisation of Iychees for a three-year period to extend their shelf-life. Mangoes from West Africa (mainly Burkina Faso and Cote d'lvoire) also suffer from a short production season, between April and June, when markets are flooded. By developing both early and late-maturing varieties, the season can be extended from three to four months. This would enable exports to begin in March, thus increasing European sales, and enabling urban markets in Africa to be supplied for a longer time. Kenya, which produces between November and March, is now competing with Brazil and Peru. The tropical production of temperate zone fruit (when it is out of season in Europe) is a new possibility currently being studied by countries with 'appropriate sub-climates in their uplands, for example, Cameroon, Madagascar and Swaziland. The Fruit and Citrus Research Institute in France has helped develop the production of peaches and strawberries in Reunion and these are now being exported to Europe in the autumn and early winter. Similarly, melons also have considerable potential in both European and local markets Although once considered as a luxury product, tropical fruit has been coming down in price as sales go up. High production costs, however, result in very slim margins for exporters. Avocados grown in humid tropical regions, for example, require expensive plant protection <b>treatment</b> <b>against</b> <b>parasites.</b> It thus appears more attractive to grow them in sub-tropical regions where a number of orchards are now being developed. The same cost-cutting measures are needed for passion fruit production in the French Antilles where labour is expensive: varieties that produce at least 20 t per hectare must be found. Several possibilities have been studied and are slated for trial in Africa Increased production generated by strong European demand also profits local markets in ACP countries. Supplies reaching their own cities have generally been far below demand and fruit consumption remains low in Africa (8 - 10 kg per person per year). So, much remains to be done to satisfy local needs. In fact, fruit production can be an important development factor when it is done in conjunction with other food crops by small farmers. It provides additional revenue which is especially welcome when it arrives during the off-season - as with mangoes in West Africa. To make the most of these various ways of boosting production, many ACP countries (often supported by the EEC) are now launching major commercial fruit production ventures, such as the one in northern Cote d'lvoire which is designed for both export and local consumption. Village gardens in northern Cameroon, school orchards or women's gardens which combine fruit and market production, are some of the ways in which local people are being familiarized with fruit that has not been part of their traditional diet. Although its future is far from guaranteed, tropical fruit has considerable potential because its market, whether international or local, is far from being saturated. Many kinds of fruit still remain to be introduced to northern consumers and there are others that have yet to be cultivated outside their natural habitat. Furthermore, the processing of fresh fruit into pulp, juice or concentrate is still not widespread and represents good possibilities for producing countries to increase their exports. In order to hang on to their place in the tropical fruit market, however, exporters must be able to adapt to the demands of consumers who are often fickle and to the even more unforgiving laws of international business.

Since current <b>treatments</b> <b>against</b> this <b>parasite</b> are highly toxic and somewhat ineffective, novel and more efficacious types of interventions are desired. Cruzain, identified as the major cathepsin for T. cruzi, {{plays a major role in}} the parasite’s life cycle; making this enzyme very attractive for potential trypanocidal drugs discovery. The recombinant cruzain is synthesized as a zymogenic pro-protein (PCZN) which possesses a pro domain and a catalytic domain. In this study we worked with the zymogen (inactive) form of the protease and, by utilizing bioinformatics tools, we identified undiscovered structure-impacting sites within the pro domain of pro-cruzain. PCZN DNA constructs containing point site mutations were successfully expressed and purified. Real-time catalytic activity assays and secondary structure analysis of mutants of PCZN revealed a structural and functional impact compared to the wild- type (WT-PCZN). These findings could be used to identify promising targets to aid in the development of future anti-chagastics agents as well as to support the development of a host of small-molecule compounds that could interfere in the maturation of the catalytically active state of the enzyme by disrupting critical aminoacid-aminoacid interactions within the zymogen. The outcome will possibly open the field of inhibitor design by advancing a novel, bottom-up approach, rather than the classical top-down approach that targets only the active-site of the enzyme. ...|$|R
40|$|Digestive and {{respiratory}} tracts parasite’s protozoan, Cryptosporidium spp. now-a-days {{is a major}} zoonotic agent, it causes self-limiting diarrhea, remaining in the body passively until the moment immune system decreases, leading {{to an increase in}} its multiplication in the mucosa and appearance of clinical signs. As there are few studies on cryptosporidiosis in wild free-living and captive animals, especially in Brazil, this study aimed to identify the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. in feces of captive animals in Cascavel, PR Municipal Zoo. Between 2011 and 2012 there have been four collections of bird feces and five mammalian feces totaling 65 and 118 samples respectively. Samples were sent to the laboratory of Veterinary Parasitology of Federal University of Parana. The feces were diluted, centrifuged and the pellets were used to make blades which were stained by the Ziehl-Neelsen modified method and observed under a microscope with 1000 X magnification. Then the blades containing the oocysts were observed under a capture microscope, where they were measured. Mammals showed 49. 15 % and birds 44. 61 % of positivity. Oocysts’ sizes ranged from 3, 54 ?m to 5, 81 ?m with an average of 4, 32 ?m for birds and 3, 11 ?m to 5, 60 ?m averaging 4, 63 ?m to mammals.

40|$|A {{specific}} breeding {{goal definition}} {{was developed for}} Creole goats in Guadeloupe. This local breed is used for meat production. To ensure a balanced selection outcome, the breeding objective included two production traits, live weight (BW 11) and dressing percentage (DP) at 11 months (the mating or selling age), one reproduction trait, fertility (FER), and two traits to assess animal response to parasite infection: packed cell volume (PCV), a resilience trait, and faecal worm eggs count (FEC), a resistance trait. A deterministic bio-economic model was developed to calculate the economic values based on {{the description of the}} profit of a Guadeloupean goat farm. The farm income came from the sale of animals for meat or as reproducers. The main costs were feeding and <b>treatments</b> <b>against</b> gastro-intestinal <b>parasites.</b> The economic values were 7. 69 € per kg for BW 11, 1. 38 € per % for FER, 3. 53 € per % for DP and 3 × 10 (- 4) € per % for PCV. The economic value for FEC was derived by comparing the expected profit and average FEC in a normal situation and in an extreme situation where parasites had developed resistance to anthelmintics. This method yielded a maximum weighting for FEC, which was - 18. 85 € per log(eggs per gram). Alternative scenarios were tested to assess the robustness of the economic values to variations in the economic and environmental context. The economic values of PCV and DP were the most stable.

40|$|The {{potential}} antiparasitic and immunomodulatory {{effect of}} three <b>treatments</b> <b>against</b> myxosporean <b>parasites</b> on the {{innate immune system}} of sharpsnout sea bream (Diplodus puntazzo) was investigated. Fish naturally infected with Myxobolus sp. (Bivalvulida/Platysporina), a histozoic parasite mainly affecting the renal interstitial tissue, were treated by oral administration {{of a combination of}} salinomycin with amprolium, Origanum essential oil or fumagillin in a small-scale field trial. Various leucocyte functions influenced by myxosporean infection were examined in order to determine treatment effects on leucocyte immunocompetence of treated fish. One month post treatment all drugs caused a significant decrease in prevalence and intensity of infection in comparison to untreated, infected fish. The effect was most prominent in salinomycin with amprolium treated fish, which 1 -month post treatment contained either no cysts at all or a few spores free in melanomacrophage centres revealing almost total elimination of the parasite and the antiparasitic action of the treatment. There was no histopathological evidence of drug toxicity. Antiparasitic action was accompanied by a significant enhancement of phagocytic activity demonstrated by ingestion of large numbers of latex beads and the secretion of high levels of reactive nitrogen intermediates by phagocytes in vitro. Complete restoration of the diminished mitogenic responses and serum lysozyme secretion was also detected in salinomycin with amprolium-treated fish compared to untreated, infected fish. These data suggest that salilomycin with amprolium may be a promising treatment for myxosporean infections in intensively cultured warm-water fish, exhibiting action partially via the enhancement of host, innate immune functions and leading to parasite elimination. © 2005 Elsevier B.

40|$|AbstractParasitic helminths cause {{significant}} {{disease in}} animals and humans. In {{the absence of}} alternative treatments, anthelmintics remain the principal agents for their control. Resistance extends to the most important class of anthelmintics, the macrocyclic lactone endectocides (MLs), such as ivermectin, and presents serious problems for the livestock industries and threatens to severely limit current parasite control strategies in humans. Understanding drug resistance is important for optimizing and monitoring control, and reducing further selection for resistance. Multidrug resistance (MDR) ABC transporters have been implicated in ML resistance and contribute to resistance {{to a number of}} other anthelmintics. MDR transporters, such as P-glycoproteins, are essential for many cellular processes that require the transport of substrates across cell membranes. Being overexpressed in response to chemotherapy in tumour cells and to ML-based treatment in nematodes, they lead to therapy failure by decreasing drug concentration at the target. Several anthelmintics are inhibitors of these efflux pumps and appropriate combinations can result in higher <b>treatment</b> efficacy <b>against</b> <b>parasites</b> and reversal of resistance. However, this needs to be balanced against possible increased toxicity to the host, or the components of the combination selecting on the same genes involved in the resistance. Increased efficacy could result from modifying anthelmintic pharmacokinetics in the host or by blocking parasite transporters involved in resistance. Combination of anthelmintics can be beneficial for delaying selection for resistance. However, it should be based on knowledge of resistance mechanisms and not simply on mode of action classes, and is best started before resistance has been selected to any member of the combination. Increasing knowledge of the MDR transporters involved in anthelmintic resistance in helminths will {{play an important role in}} allowing for the identification of markers to monitor the spread of resistance and to evaluate new tools and management practices aimed at delaying its spread...|$|R

Towards this objective, the nematophagous fungus, Duddingtonia flagrans (Df), was used in a plot study against two main parasitic nematode species of goats, Teladorsagia circumcincta (Tcir) and Trichostrongylus colubriformis (Tcol). Worm-free, culled goats were experimentally infected with strains of Tcir and Tcol to constitute donors. Half of the animals were periodically given Df chlamydospores at a daily dose of 2. 5 × 10 ^ 5 spores/kg BW while the remaining animals were kept as controls. At 5 time periods i. e. March, May, July, September and November 2001, corresponding to the main grazing season in France for goats, faeces were collected from the 6 th day of fungus administration for the following 2 days to obtain approximately 1 kg of faeces from each group of animals: Tcir/Control, Tcol/Control, Tcir/Fungus, Tcol/Fungus. For each period and each group, the faeces were deposited on a 1 m^ 2 grass plot and the grass was cut (3 replicates) on weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 after deposition, for infective larval recovery. Larvae were counted and the results were expressed as a ratio of larvae/eggs deposited. On the plots with the control faeces deposited in March, July and September, the grass infectivity due to Tcir and Tcol was similar and the maximum number occurred between 2 and 4 weeks post deposition. In May, the maximum numbers of larvae were not recorded until 8 weeks after deposition, due to high daily temperatures and dryness. In November, larval development took place only for Tcir. On the plots with the fungus treated faeces, a significant reduction in grass infectivity occurred for both nematodes and ranged from 50 - 60...|$|R
40|$|Since {{their first}} {{discovery}} in the 19 th century, microsporidian {{species have been}} found to be successful obligate intracellular parasites capable of infecting a wide variety of hosts including economically and ecologically important organisms as well as model organisms for biomedical research. Recently, cases of infection of the widely used animal model Danio rerio, commonly known as the zebrafish, by the newly described microsporidium Pseudoloma neurophilia have been reported in an increasing number of research facilities. Current knowledge of the biology of this parasite found in 75 % of the Zebrafish Resource Center facilities is limited to microscopic analyses on its lifecycle as well as its physical, behavioral and psychic impact on its hosts. Despite the growing relevance of this parasite in biomedical research no current data is available on its genome. In this dissertation, I provide additional knowledge on the basic biology of P. neurophilia by acquiring and exploring the content and structure of the first genome draft of the zebrafish parasite. My findings reveal that the 5. 25 Mb genome of P. neurophilia harbors an unusually high amount of transposable elements as well as numerous inserts found in coding regions typically conserved in microsporidia and other organisms. This peculiar obligate parasite demonstrates strong phylogenetic and genetic relationships with other fish-mosquito microsporidia. Similar to what is observed in closely related species, intra-genomic analyses of P. neurophilia’s genome suggest that it is diploid and possesses a large repertoire of over a thousand putative genes unique to this specie. Overall, my findings provide new insights into the basic biology of this parasite and represent a milestone in the understanding of P. neurophilia and D. rerio host-parasite interaction and ultimately in the development of <b>treatments</b> <b>against</b> this <b>parasite</b> that has been infecting the zebrafish research industry for the past decades. ...|$|R
40|$|Human neurocysticercosis is {{a disease}} caused by the {{ingestion}} of Taenia solium eggs, which are released in faeces within the final segments or proglottids of the parasite.

In contrast several seroepidemiological studies have demonstrated that the presence of the tapeworm carrier in the household or in the close environment is the main risk factor associated to human and swine cysticercosis.

40|$|Salt is {{commonly}} recommended as an inexpensive <b>treatment</b> <b>against</b> many fish <b>parasites</b> in freshwater fish culture; however, {{few studies have}} scientifically evaluated its efficacy. Amongst the monogeneans, salt has only been previously tested against Gyrodactylus salaris infecting Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and G. derjavini infecting rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Here we tested the efficacy of salt <b>treatments</b> <b>against</b> G. bullatarudis and G. turnbulli on guppies (Poecilia reticulata), both commercially important pathogens in the ornamental fish industry. In vitro survival of both parasites was negatively correlated with increasing salinities of 3, 5, 7 and 33 gL− 1. Parasite establishment on guppies maintained at 0, 3 and 7 gL− 1 salinity decreased drastically for G. turnbulli from 94 % in the control to 78 and 0 % on fish in 3 and 7 gL− 1 salinity, respectively. G. bullatarudis establishment was still 100 % at 3 gL− 1 salinity but was reduced to 73 % in 7 gL− 1. Throughout an infection, parasite populations of both species increased faster on guppies in 3 gL− 1 salinity compared to dechlorinated water, whereas population growth was severely affected at 7 gL− 1 salinity. Overall a short duration, high concentration salt bath was most effective at treating gyrodactylid infections: 15 min exposure to 25 gL− 1 salinity for adults or 5 min for juvenile fish removed 100 % of G. turnbulli or 72 % of G. bullatarudis. The results reflect the generalist characteristics of the more tolerant G. bullatarudis compared to G. turnbulli, but have wider implications for treatment application: clearly one treatment regime does not suit all even within a genus...|$|R

40|$|The phylum Apicomplexa {{includes}} many protozoan parasites that cause serious {{human and animal}} disease, for example Plasmodium, Eimeria and Toxoplasma. <b>Treatments</b> <b>against</b> these <b>parasites</b> are limited and novel solutions are urgently required. Recently, {{research has focused on}} parasite specific features of lipid biosynthesis as drug targets. In particular the biosynthesis of sphingolipids, which have essential roles in many processes, has been highlighted as a potential target. Using the model apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii we are studying the role of parasite and host sphingolipid biosynthesis in invasion and proliferation. Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) catalyzes the first step in sphingolipid biosynthesis, and our results demonstrated that the expression of host cell SPT is unaffected by Toxoplasma infection. In mammals the primary complex sphingolipid is sphingomyelin (SM), again our data demonstrated that the SM synthases (1 and 2) are not influenced by infection. Together these data indicated that parasite manipulation of host sphingolipid biosynthesis does not occur, supporting the hypothesis that Toxoplasma is dependant on de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis. To characterise this pathway, we showed that the Toxoplasma TgSPT 1 and 2 are, like other eukaryotes, localised and active in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, uniquely, they have a prokaryotic origin. Metabolic labelling showed that several distinct complex sphingolipids are synthesized independently by the parasite. The fungal inositol phosphorylceramide (IPC) synthase inhibitor aureobasidin A (AbA) has been reported to target Toxoplasma IPC synthesis. However, our results demonstrated that whilst AbA, and an orthologue, are active <b>against</b> the <b>parasite,</b> their effect on Toxoplasma de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis is negligible. In addition, by using Leishmania major as a model we have analysed the global effect of compounds recognised as IPC synthase inhibitors in this kinetoplastid protozoan parasite. The results showed that ceramide levels increased in treated parasites, perhaps leading to parasite death via secondary signalling dysfunction. These data confirmed that the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway is targeted by these anti-leishmanial compounds. Finally, the anti-leishmanial drug miltefosine showed reduced activity against a transgenic strain of L. major lacking sphingolipid biosynthesis ΔLCB 2 compared to wild type. This suggested the sphingolipid synthesis has a role in sensitivity to the drug, metabolomic analyses supported this. Taken together, the present findings further characterised the T. gondii sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway and indicated the potential to target this in drug discovery efforts. In addition, metabolomic and lipidomic approaches confirmed that clemastine targets L. major IPCS. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis Krøyer), an ectoparasitic copepod with {{a complex}} life cycle causes {{significant}} losses in salmon aquaculture. Pesticide <b>treatments</b> <b>against</b> the <b>parasite</b> raise environmental concerns and their efficacy is gradually decreasing. Improvement of fish resistance to lice, through biological control methods, needs {{better understanding of}} the protective mechanisms. We used a 21 k oligonucleotide microarray and RT-qPCR to examine the time-course of immune gene expression changes in salmon skin, spleen, and head kidney during the first 15 days after challenge, which encompassed the copepod and chalimus stages of lice development. Results Large scale and highly complex transcriptome responses were found already one day after infection (dpi). Many genes showed bi-phasic expression profiles with abrupt changes between 5 and 10 dpi (the copepod-chalimus transitions); the greatest fluctuations (up- and down-regulation) were seen in a large group of secretory splenic proteases with unknown roles. Rapid sensing was witnessed with induction of genes involved in innate immunity including lectins and enzymes of eicosanoid metabolism in skin and acute phase proteins in spleen. Transient (1 - 5 dpi) increase of T-cell receptor alpha, CD 4 - 1, and possible regulators of lymphocyte differentiation suggested recruitment of T-cells of unidentified lineage to the skin. After 5 dpi the magnitude of transcriptomic responses decreased markedly in skin. Up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases in all studied organs suggested establishment of a chronic inflammatory status. Up-regulation of putative lymphocyte G 0 /G 1 switch proteins in spleen at 5 dpi, immunoglobulins at 15 dpi; and increase of IgM and IgT transcripts in skin indicated an onset of adaptive humoral immune responses, whereas MHCI appeared to be down-regulated. Conclusions Atlantic salmon develops rapid local and systemic reactions to L. salmonis, which, however, do not result in substantial level of protection. The dramatic changes observed after 5 dpi can be associated with metamorphosis of copepod, immune modulation by the parasite, or transition from innate to adaptive immune responses. </p...|$|R
