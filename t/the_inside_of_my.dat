500|$|Critical {{reception}} of {{the leader of the}} Flood were mixed. In a review of Halo 2, Mike Leonard of the AllXbox community said that the introduction of the Gravemind character had him [...] "rolling my eyes hard enough to get motion sickness from seeing the back of <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> skull"; Leonard {{went on to say that}} the [...] "Little Shop of Horrors reject" [...] ruined the [...] "cool" [...] of the Halo franchise. Staff from GamesRadar singled out the appearance of the Gravemind as a sign the Halo series had jumped the shark. [...] "Until Gravemind showed up, we were pretty sure we understood the Halo series' story," [...] they wrote, but that the appearance of a Venus Flytrap-like creature with an ego and [...] "a tendency to spout philosophical drivel" [...] was unexpected. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com bemoaned the fact that Gravemind was never explicitly stated to be the Flood leader in either Halo 2 or Halo 3 and was hardly seen in the third installment. Publications also took issue with the fact that the character's motivations were never fully explored; the South Florida Sun-Sentinel said that the [...] "unique and compelling characters" [...] of Halo 3, such as Cortana and the Master Chief, were overwhelmed by Gravemind.|$|E

Inside the skull itself, each compartment holds a scrap of paper, representing a memory or thought. The center compartment, however, holds only a white rat, which represents Kurelek's spirit. The rat is wound up and inert, having run through the maze of the skull chewing a piece of each scrap of paper and finding it undigestible.|$|E

There was an element of mere liking for Davie; there was an element of being determined, in case of accidents, to keep well with him.

6000|$|THOREAU. - Here is {{an admirable}} {{instance}} of the [...] "point of view" [...] forced throughout, and of too earnest reflection on imperfect facts. Upon me this pure, narrow, sunnily-ascetic Thoreau had exercised a great charm. I have scarce written ten sentences since I was introduced to him, but his influence might be somewhere detected by a close observer. Still it was as a writer that I had made his acquaintance; I took him on his own explicit terms; and when I learned details of his life, they were, {{by the nature of}} the case and my own PARTI-PRIS, read even with a certain violence in terms of his writings. There could scarce be a perversion more justifiable than that; yet it was still a perversion. The study indeed, raised so much ire in the breast of Dr. Japp (H. A. Page), Thoreau's sincere and learned disciple, that had either of us been men, I please myself with thinking, of less temper and justice, the difference might have made us enemies instead of making us friends. To him who knew the man from <b>the</b> <b>inside,</b> many <b>of</b> <b>my</b> statements sounded like inversions made on purpose; and yet when we came to talk of them together, and he had understood how I was looking at the man through the books, while he had long since learned to read the books through the man, I believe he understood the spirit in which I had been led astray.|$|R
60|$|I {{began with}} that vigour which is born of hopeful {{determination}} to succeed or die. But, as time wore on, the increasing weakness and exhaustion began to render me less capable of enduring the intense cold. Having my wallet {{on my back}} I took out some biscuit and pemmican and ate it as I walked. This revived me a good deal, nevertheless I restrained myself, feeling convinced that nothing but steady, quiet perseverance would carry me through. Soon thirst began to torment me, yet I did not dare to eat snow, as that would have merely injured <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mouth, and frozen the skin of my lips. This feeling did not however last long. It {{was followed by a}} powerful sense of drowsiness.|$|E
60|$|Using my knife, I {{discovered}} that the light proceeded from {{that portion of the}} sapwood immediately under the bark, and thus presented a regular ring at the end, and when I pared off the bark and cut into the sap, it was all aglow along the log. I was surprised to find the wood quite hard and apparently sound, though probably decay had commenced in the sap, and I cut out some little triangular chips, and, placing them in the hollow of my hand, carried them into the camp, waked my companion, and showed them to him. They lit up <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> hand, revealing the lines and wrinkles, and appearing exactly like coals of fire raised to a white heat.|$|E
60|$|On {{the fourth}} day, venturing out early {{a little too}} far, I saw twenty or thirty natives upon a height not above five hundred yards from me. They were stark naked, men, women, and children, round a fire, as I could {{discover}} by the smoke. One of them spied me, and gave notice to the rest; five of them advanced toward me, leaving {{the women and children}} at the fire. I made what haste I could to the shore, and, getting into my canoe, shoved off: the savages, observing me retreat, ran after me: and before I could get far enough into the sea, discharged an arrow which wounded me deeply on <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> left knee: I shall carry the mark to my grave. I apprehended the arrow might be poisoned, and paddling {{out of the reach of}} their darts (being a calm day), I made a shift to suck the wound, and dress it as well as I could.|$|E
60|$|At {{the risk}} of {{becoming}} the laughing-stock <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own servant, I again slipped my key under the door, imprisoning myself for the night. Then, finding it too early to go to bed, I lay down with my clothes on {{and began to read}} one of Dumas's novels. Suddenly I was gripped--gripped and dragged from the couch. It is only thus that I can describe the overpowering nature of the force which pounced upon me. I clawed at the coverlet. I clung to the wood-work. I believe that I screamed out in my frenzy. It was all useless, hopeless. I MUST go. There was no way out of it. It was only at the outset that I resisted. The force soon became too overmastering for that. I thank goodness that there were no watchers there to interfere with me. I could not have answered for myself if there had been. And, besides the determination to get out, there came to me, also, the keenest and coolest judgment in choosing my means. I lit a candle and endeavored, kneeling in front of the door, to pull the key through with the feather-end of a quill pen. It was just too short and pushed it further away. Then with quiet persistence I got a paper-knife {{out of one of the}} drawers, and with that I managed to draw the key back. I opened the door, stepped into my study, took a photograph of myself from the bureau, wrote something across it, placed it in <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> pocket <b>of</b> <b>my</b> coat, and then started off for Wilson's.|$|R
6000|$|... "I came {{up quite}} close to her from behind. She went on without stopping, without looking aside, {{as though she had}} been all alone on the island. A brave woman, monsieur. I put <b>the</b> {{revolver}} <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> breast <b>of</b> <b>my</b> blue blouse and waited. A flash of lightning and a clap of thunder destroyed both the sound and the light of the signal for an instant, but she never faltered, pulling at the cord and swinging the lantern as regularly as a machine. She was a comely woman of thirty--no more. I thought to myself, 'All that's no good on a night like this.' And I made up my mind that if a body <b>of</b> <b>my</b> fellow-convicts came down to the pier--which was sure to happen soon--I would shoot her through the head before I shot myself. I knew the 'comrades' well. This idea of mine gave me quite an interest in life, monsieur; and at once, instead of remaining stupidly exposed on the pier, I retreated a little way and crouched behind a bush. I did not intend to let myself be pounced upon unawares and be prevented perhaps from rendering a supreme service to at least one human creature before I died myself.|$|R
60|$|The {{very next}} day after this wall was finished, I had almost all my labour overthrown at once, and myself killed; the case was thus:--As I was busy in <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> it, behind <b>my</b> tent, just at the {{entrance}} into my cave, I was terribly frightened with a most dreadful surprising thing indeed; for, all on a sudden, I found the earth come crumbling down from the roof <b>of</b> <b>my</b> cave, and {{from the edge of}} the hill over my head, and two of the posts I had set up in the cave cracked in a frightful manner. I was heartily scared; but thought nothing of what really was the cause, only thinking that the top <b>of</b> <b>my</b> cave was falling in, as some of it had done before: and for fear I should be buried in it, I ran forward to my ladder, and not thinking myself safe there neither, I got over my wall for fear of the pieces of the hill which I expected might roll down upon me. I had no sooner stepped down upon the firm ground, than I plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake; for the ground I stood on shook three times at about eight minutes distance, with three such shocks as would have overturned the strongest building that could be supposed to have stood on the earth; and a great piece of the top of a rock, which stood about half a mile from me, next the sea, fell down, with such a terrible noise as I never heard in all my life. I perceived also that the very sea was put into a violent motion by it; and I believe the shocks were stronger under the water than on the island.|$|R
