25|$|In {{spite of}} her successes, Blankers-Koen nearly failed to start in the semi-finals of the 200m, held the day after hurdles final. Shortly before the semi-final, she broke down because of homesickness. After a long <b>talk</b> <b>by</b> her husband, she decided to run anyway, and {{qualified}} for the final with great ease. The final, on 6 August, was again held in the pouring rain, but Blankers-Koen completed the inaugural Olympic 200m for women in 24.4, seven tenths of a second ahead of runner-up Audrey Williamson—still the largest margin of victory in an Olympic 200m final. Audrey Patterson, the first African American woman to win an Olympic medal placed in third, although a finish photo discovered decades later indicates Shirley Strickland should have won the bronze.|$|E

The Cuban government also had been warned by senior KGB agents Osvaldo Sánchez Cabrera and 'Aragon', who died violently {{before and after the}} invasion, respectively. The general Cuban population was not well informed, except for CIA-funded Radio Swan. As of May 1960, almost all means of public communication were in the government's hands.|$|E

25|$|Panama also {{received}} {{a large number of}} Syrian Jewish immigrants, mostly from Halab (Aleppo), where they constitute the largest group in Panama's 15,000 strong Jewish Sephardic community. The first wave of immigrants arrived in the late 1940s after riots in Aleppo due to the Arab–Israeli conflict. The community consists of many synagogues all united under its flagship, Shevet Ahim Synagogue, where their late Chief Rabbi Zion Levy officiated. The community maintains close contact with their counterparts in North America as well as Israel. In his later years, Rabbi Levy oversaw the construction of new synagogues in Panama City and worked for smooth relations with the country’s Arab and Muslim communities. He frequently phoned the country’s imam for a <b>talk.</b> <b>By</b> the time of his death, the Shevet Ahim community numbered 10,000 Jews, 6,000 of whom are Torah-observant. The community now includes several synagogues, mikvahs, three Jewish schools, a yeshiva, a kollel, and a girls' seminary, along with several kosher restaurants and supermarkets.|$|E
25|$|In 1878, the Ottoman Empire's Kars region—including Ani—was {{incorporated}} into the Russian Empire's Transcaucasian region. In 1892 the first archaeological excavations were conducted at Ani, sponsored by the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences and supervised by the Russian archaeologist and orientalist Nicholas Marr (1864–1934). Marr's excavations at Ani resumed in 1904 and continued yearly until 1917. Large sectors of the city were professionally excavated, numerous buildings were uncovered and measured, the finds were studied and published in academic journals, guidebooks for the monuments and the museum were written, and the whole site was surveyed for the first time. Emergency repairs were also undertaken on those buildings that were most at risk of collapse. A museum was established to house {{the tens of thousands}} of items found during the excavations. This museum was housed in two buildings: the Minuchihr mosque, and a purpose-built stone building. Armenians from neighboring villages and towns also began to visit the city on a regular basis, and there was even <b>talk</b> <b>by</b> Marr's team of building a school for educating the local Armenian children, building parks, and planting trees to beautify the site.|$|E
