5|$|The {{division}} continued patrol activity around Old Baldy Hill and Pork Chop Hill into 1953, digging {{tunnels and}} building a network of outposts and bunkers on and around <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> <b>In</b> April, the North Korean Army began stepping up offensive operations against UN forces. During the Battle of Porkchop Hill, the Chinese 67th and 141st divisions overran Pork Chop Hill using massed infantry and artillery fire. The hill had been {{under the control of}} the 31st Infantry. The 31st counterattacked with reinforcements from the 17th Infantry and recaptured the area the next day. On 6 July the North Koreans and Chinese launched a determined attack against Pork Chop resulting in five days of fierce fighting with few meaningful results. By the end of July, five infantry battalions from the 31st and 17th were defending the hill, while a Chinese division was in position to attack it. During this standoff, the UN ordered the 7th Infantry Division to retreat from <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>in</b> preparation for an armistice, which would end major hostilities.|$|E
5|$|Around midnight, {{the men of}} the 72nd and the 52nd passed Bab al-Wad noiselessly {{and then}} {{separated}} towards their respective targets. One company took Deir Ayyub, which was empty, but then were discovered as they did so by enemies on a nearby hill. They suffered the joint fire of the Legion's artillery and machines guns. Thirteen men were killed and several other injured. The company, composed mainly of immigrants, then retreated to Bab al-Wad. The 52nd Battalion was preparing to take <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>in</b> front of Yalu, but received an order to retreat.|$|E
5|$|By December 1998, Mohn's {{successor}} Jan Jensen {{was supporting}} granting Vikersundbakken national venue status {{in preparation for}} it hosting the FIS Ski-Flying World Championships 2000. By December, a limited company had been established to continue the planning and construction of <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> <b>In</b> July 1999, Vikersundbakken was granted a national venue status for ten years, which secured both state grants {{and the right to}} hold all World Cup ski flying events the following ten years. After the 2000 World Championships, Vikersundbakken's Torstein Haugerud protested that Bertil Pålsrud, who was both managing director of Rødkleiva Skiflyging {{and a member of the}} Norwegian Ski Federation's ski jumping committee, was using his position in the federation to promote the Rødkleiva project.|$|E
40|$|This essay {{concerns}} <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts <b>in</b> Halland. <b>The</b> <b>hill</b> forts <b>in</b> Halland haven’t been archaeologically {{examined and}} they haven’t been studied {{as well as}} <b>hill</b> forts <b>in</b> other parts of Sweden. The focus of this essay {{is to determine the}} use of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts <b>in</b> Halland.   Comparative studies will be made between Halland’s <b>hill</b> forts and <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts of Bohuslän and <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts of <b>the</b> Eastern part of Sweden. The results of the research have yielded that <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts <b>in</b> Halland strongly reminiscent of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts <b>in</b> Bohuslän {{when it comes to the}} positioning in the landscape, as well as the general appearance of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts. There are remains of houses <b>in</b> some of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts <b>in</b> Bohuslän. Because of the similarities with <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts <b>in</b> Bohuslän, there is a possibility that there have been houses on top of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts <b>in</b> Halland. It is not possible to say whether <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts <b>in</b> Halland have been places of “safe haven” and/or permanent residents. Most of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts <b>in</b> Halland have great view over seas or the ocean, as well as over the inland. They tend to be located close to old roads and would have had a great overview of them. It’s possible that <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts were connected to trading posts. Signaling between <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern part of Halland is possible because of the closeness of them. Drawings of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts have been made successfully; they show roughly where the walls of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> fort are situated and where the precipices and inclinations are situated. The drawings make it easier to compare <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts <b>in</b> Halland to <b>hill</b> forts <b>in</b> other parts of Sweden...|$|R

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Planica event and following numerous near-flat ground landings, it became clear that ski flying had once again outgrown an older hill and needed enlarging in the years to come. In 2005, almost immediately after the conclusion of the World Cup season, talks were under way to upgrade <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>in</b> Vikersund. This became a reality in mid-2010, when the FIS announced major rule changes at the 47th International Ski Congress in Antalya, Turkey, to allow for ski flying hills to be constructed to their largest sizes yet.|$|E
5|$|Minehead {{is governed}} by a town council, which was created in 1983 and {{has been part of}} the West Somerset local {{government}} district since 1974. In addition to the parish church of St. Michael on <b>the</b> <b>Hill</b> <b>in</b> Minehead, the separate parish church of St Michael the Archangel is situated in Church Street, Alcombe. Alcombe is also home to the Spiritualist Church in Grove Place. Since 1991, Minehead has been twinned with Saint-Berthevin, a small town close to the regional centre of Laval in the Mayenne département of France. Blenheim Gardens, which is Minehead’s largest park, was opened in 1925. The town is also the home of a Butlins Holiday Park which increases Minehead's seasonal tourist population by several thousand.|$|E
5|$|Several archaeological digs have {{revealed}} that the site was occupied during the Upper Palaeolithic. There is evidence of an open settlement of the Creswellian culture on <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>in</b> {{the middle of the}} headland dating to around 14,100 years ago. With over 13,000 lithic artefacts it is probably the largest site of the period. Most interesting were several blades typically found at Upper Paleolithic sites across Europe, but rarely seen outside of caves in the UK, where open air sites of this age are extremely rare. People at the Head were heavily involved with the production of blades, further excavations identified 649 tools, dominated by backed blades, endscrapers and burins.|$|E

5|$|The college {{began looking}} for a new home at the same time Syracuse, ninety miles to the east, was engaged in a search to bring a {{university}} to the city, having failed to convince Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White to locate Cornell University there rather than in Ithaca. Syracuse resident White pressed that the new university should locate on <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>in</b> Syracuse (the current location of Syracuse University) due to the city's attractive transportation hub, which would ease the recruitment of faculty, students, and other persons of note. However, as a young carpenter working in Syracuse, Cornell had been twice robbed of his wages, and thereafter considered Syracuse a Sodom and Gomorrah insisting the university be in Ithaca on his large farm on East Hill, overlooking the town and Cayuga Lake.|$|E
5|$|The hill {{stands at}} a {{strategic}} location overlooking {{the point where the}} River Tone and the old course of the River Cary join the River Parrett. Although there is some evidence of Roman visitation, the first fortification of the site was the construction of a Norman motte. It has been called King Alfred's Fort, however there is no proof of use by Alfred the Great. A medieval church was built on <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>in</b> the 15th century. The current ruined church on top of the hill was built in 1793. The land and ruin were donated to the National Trust in 1946 as a war memorial.|$|E
5|$|At 02:45, the Chinese began a {{sixth and}} final attack {{with a heavy}} mortar barrage which inflicted heavy {{casualties}} on the remaining Rangers, including Cummings, who was killed instantly by a mortar shell and Puckett, who was severely wounded. The Chinese then sent a reinforced battalion of 600 infantry at the hill, while simultaneously striking other elements of Task Force Dolvin, preventing artillery from providing effective support. Without artillery support of their own, and low on ammunition, they were overwhelmed by the subsequent Chinese attack. The Chinese forces swarmed <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>in</b> overwhelming numbers, {{and many of the}} Rangers were shot and killed in their foxholes or stabbed with bayonets. The company was destroyed in the fighting, with the survivors retreating from the hill. Three Rangers later chased away Chinese troops as they tried to capture the severely wounded Puckett. The remaining Rangers gathered at an assembly area {{at the base of the}} hill under First Sergeant Charles L. Pitts, the highest ranking unwounded member of the company, and withdrew. The Rangers suffered over 80 percent casualties on Hill 205; of the 51 who captured the hill, 10 were killed or missing and another 31 wounded.|$|E

5|$|At {{daylight}} on {{the morning}} of 4 September only two officers and approximately half the men who had assembled on the hill, were alive. As the day passed, with ammunition down to about one clip per man and only a few grenades left and no help in sight, McDoniel decided to abandon the position that night. When it got dark the survivors would split into small groups and try to get back to friendly lines. That evening after dark the North Koreans launched another weak attack against the position. At 22:00, McDoniel and Caldwell and 27 enlisted men slipped off <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>in</b> groups of four. Master Sergeant Travis E. Watkins, still alive in his paralyzed condition, refused efforts of evacuation, saying {{that he did not want}} to be a burden to those who had a chance to get away. He asked only that his carbine be loaded and placed on his chest with the muzzle under his chin. Like Oullette, he would also win the Medal of Honor for his actions. Of the 29 men who came off the hill the night of September 4, 22 escaped to friendly lines, many of them following the Naktong downstream, hiding by day and traveling by night, until they reached the lines of the US 25th Infantry Division.|$|E
5|$|Red Cloud, then a corporal, was manning {{a forward}} {{listening}} post {{in front of}} his company's command post position on <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> <b>In</b> the middle of the night, he began hearing suspicious noises, before spotting a number of Chinese troops intent on surprising the Americans. Red Cloud raised an alarm and began firing on the advancing Chinese troops with an M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR). The assistant BAR man with him in their foxhole was killed by the Chinese returning fire. Red Cloud was then shot twice in the chest. In spite of these wounds and after being attended to by a company platoon medic, he refused to withdraw from his post, and continued to fire accurately on the Chinese troops which caused significant casualties among their advancing force. Crucially, his actions alerted his company to the impending attack, preventing an ambush. After he was hit again and attended to by the same medic, Red Cloud propped himself against a tree and continued to fire, exposing himself to intense Chinese fire. He was shot at least eight times in the firefight. Suffering from severe injuries and too weak to support himself, he ordered a soldier near him, to tie him upright to the tree using the soldier's web belt, and then ordered these men to withdraw with the other wounded men to the main positions. Eventually, the Chinese overran Red Cloud's position and the hill.|$|E
5|$|The {{technicians}} {{start the}} washing process immediately, since delay can cause fermentation of the sugary coating surrounding the bean and ruination {{of the coffee}} flavour. The beans are first thrown into a deep tank. The best cherries sink {{to the bottom and}} pass through a machine that removes their skin. The technicians remove any floating cherries and process them {{in the same way as}} the others for the cooperative to sell on the domestic market for less than specialty-coffee price. The beans are fed through one of the cooperative's three de-skinning and selection machines to remove their skins and most of the sugary coating before running the individual beans through a vibrating colander. The colander separates the very highest quality Grade A beans from those labeled Grade B; the two grades are sent separately down <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>in</b> a water chute with a 1 percent gradient. This process allows for further separation of beans based on quality, with around 15 tanks available at the bottom for capture of the different types. The beans are kept submerged, two days for the best and 15–20 hours for the lesser beans, which causes a small amount of fermentation to convert the remainder of the sugar without significantly impairing the flavour.|$|E
