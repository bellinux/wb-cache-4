5|$|Manhunter {{focuses on}} the {{forensic}} work {{carried out by the}} FBI to track down killers and shows the long-term effects that cases like this have on profilers such as Graham, highlighting the similarities between him and his quarry. The film features heavily stylized use of color to convey <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> duality, {{and the nature of the}} characters' similarity has been explored in academic readings of the film. It was the first film adaptation of Harris' Hannibal Lecter novels, as well as the first adaptation of Red Dragon, which later became the basis for a film of the same name in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl drew on his {{imprisonment}} at Auschwitz in composing Man's Search for Meaning (1946), one of {{the most}} widely read works about the camp. An existentialist work, the book argues that individuals can find purpose even among great suffering, and that <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> purpose sustains them. Wiesel wrote about his own imprisonment at Auschwitz in Night (1960) and other works, and became a prominent spokesman against ethnic violence. In 1986, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.|$|E
5|$|The Goth. sibja, OHG. sippia, sippa, AS. sib gen. sibbe, denote peace, friendship, kindred; {{from these}} I infer a divinity Sibja, Sippia, Sib, {{corresponding}} to ON. Sif gen. Sifjar, {{the wife of}} Thôrr, for the ON. too has a pl. sifjar meaning cognatio, sifi amicus (OHG. sippio, sippo), sift genus, cognatio. By <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the word, Sif would appear to be, like Frigg and Freyja, a goddess of loveliness and love; as attributes of Oðinn and Thôrr agree, their wives Frigg and Sif have also a common signification.|$|E

5|$|<b>This</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> unity was {{represented}} in new media. Dutch-language magazines for educated native youth, {{such as the}} Jong Java (1915) and Jong Sumatranen Bond (1917), advocated a modern national identity without the traditional feudal system. Nationalist views were advocated through magazines for adults, including Pandji Poestaka (first published 1930) and Timboel (first published 1932); these were short-lived publications and only included literature as a supplement. There were also unsuccessful attempts to found Malay-language literary publications, such as Malaya (announced in 1921).|$|E
5|$|Additional traits {{shared with}} other {{prosimian}} primates (strepsirrhine primates and tarsiers) include a bicornuate (two-horned) uterus and epitheliochorial placentation. Because their thumbs are only pseudo-opposable, making their movement less {{independent of the}} other fingers, their hands are less than perfect at grasping and manipulating objects. On their feet, they have a widely abducted hallux (first toe) which facilitates the grasping of tree limbs. A common misconception is that lemurs have a prehensile tail, a trait found only in New World monkeys, particularly atelids, among primates. Lemurs also rely heavily on their sense of smell, a trait shared with most other mammals and early primates, {{but not with the}} visually oriented higher primates. <b>This</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell is important in terms of marking territory as well as provide an indication of whether or not another lemur is a viable breeding partner.|$|E
5|$|For decades afterward, Jennings {{repeatedly}} {{admitted that}} he felt responsible for the crash that killed Buddy Holly. <b>This</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> guilt precipitated bouts of substance abuse through much of Jennings' career. The day of the flight was later known as the Day the Music Died. Jennings sang The Stage, {{a tribute to the}} Day the Music Died. He recreated the concert performers on February 2, 1959, in order at the Surf Ballroom, starting with Eddie Cochran, then Ritchie Valens, the Big Bopper and, finally, Buddy Holly. This was the concert that preceded the infamous plane crash. The Stage {{can be found on the}} Surf Ballroom Winter Dance Party CD.|$|E

5|$|For the Muslim sepoys in the 5th Light Infantry, {{interaction}} with Kasim Mansur, {{who was an}} Indian Muslim merchant in Singapore, served to fuel <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> divided loyalties further. Kasim Mansur together with a local imam, Nur Alam Shah, would often host members of the 5th Light Infantry at Mansur’s home {{and it was then}} that the duo persuaded the Muslim sepoys to adhere to the fatwa issued by the Ottoman Sultan and to turn their guns against their British commanding officers and contribute towards the war against these kafirs who were battling their Muslim brothers who were defending the Caliphate in the West. It was within this context that the plan was hatched for the mutiny.|$|E

25|$|The {{battle was}} the first clearly definable French victory of the war. The Paras and their commanders enjoyed immense {{popularity}} with the Pied-noirs and <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> exuberance and strength would reach its zenith during the May 1958 crisis.|$|E

25|$|The 7th Jeju Forum for Peace and Prosperity {{reviewed}} {{these changes}} within historic context and highlight {{the future of}} Asia.

25|$|For artists, most {{pigments}} {{and papers}} have a cool or warm cast, {{as the human}} eye can detect even a minute amount of saturation. Gray mixed with yellow, orange, or red is a “warm gray”. Green, blue, or purple create “cool grays”. Note that <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> temperature is the reverse of that of real temperature; bluer is described as “cooler” even though it corresponds to a higher-temperature black body.|$|E
50|$|When {{the toast}} was done, as {{determined}} by a small bimetallic sensor actuated by the heat passing through the toast, the heaters were shut off and the pull-down mechanism returned to its room-temperature position, slowly raising the finished toast. <b>This</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>of</b> the heat passing through the toast, meant that regardless {{of the color of}} the bread (white or wholemeal) and the initial temperature of the bread (even frozen), the bread would always be toasted to the same degree. If a piece of toast was re-inserted into the toaster, it would be only reheated.|$|R

25|$|Continuity {{theory is}} the view that in ageing people are {{inclined}} to maintain, {{as much as they}} can, the same habits, personalities and styles of life that they have developed in earlier years. Continuity theory is Atchley's theory that individuals, in later life, make adaptations to enable them to gain a sense of continuity between {{the past and the present}} and the theory implies that <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> continuity helps to contribute to well-being in later life. Disengagement theory, activity theory and continuity theory are social theories about ageing, though all may be products of their era rather than a valid, universal theory.|$|E
25|$|Given <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> caution among {{key members}} of the British cabinet and of the army, it is even harder to {{understand}} why the British government went against the advice of its generals (such as Wolseley) to send substantial reinforcements to South Africa before war broke out. One strong argument is that Lansdowne, Secretary of State for War, did not believe the Boers were preparing for war, and also believed that if Britain were to send large numbers of troops, it would strike too aggressive a posture and so prevent a negotiated settlement being reached or even encourage a Boer attack.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{political}} {{developments in the}} 1980s such as the militant Khalistan movement, the influx of undocumented Bangladeshi immigration into Assam, Muslim mobilisation in the Shah Bano case {{as well as the}} Satanic Verses controversy caused a sense of vulnerability among the Hindus in India. The VHP and the BJP utilised <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> vulnerability to push forward a militant Hindutva nationalist agenda leading to the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. The BJP officially adopted Hindutva as its ideology in its 1989 Palampur resolution, reversing the 1951 move of its original founder Syama Prasad Mookerjee. This led to the unlawful demolition of the Babri Masjid by rioters in 1992.|$|E

25|$|Several {{months before}} the Democratic and Republican conventions, Perot filled the vacuum of {{election}} news, as his supporters began petition drives to {{get him on the}} ballot in all 50 states. <b>This</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> momentum was reinforced when Perot employed two savvy campaign managers in Democrat Hamilton Jordan and Republican Ed Rollins. In July, while Perot was pondering whether to run for office, his supporters established a campaign organization United We Stand America. Perot was late in making formal policy proposals, but most of what he did call for were intended to reduce the deficit, such as a gasoline tax increase and cutbacks to Social Security.|$|E
25|$|Under foreign rule, the Low Countries {{were able}} to {{extensively}} develop economically and politically. However, {{the sense of a}} shared “nationality” was still non-existent. <b>This</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> nationality was forged through conflict and was the result of opposition to a despotic governing body. This opposition grew stronger with imposed taxation and centralization by the foreign ruler. The Dutch Revolt that occurred {{as a result of this}} opposition changed forever the structure of the Netherlands. Known as the Eighty Years War, the revolt lasted between 1568 and 1648 and allowed for the beginning of the formation of a sense of nationality and at about the middle of the 16th century, people no longer described themselves as inhabitants of one of the Provinces, but simply as Belga or Flamengus both signifying Netherlander. An awareness of a common nationality started to emerge as people began to identify themselves with a national group rather than with local interests.|$|E
25|$|Carns and Sloan {{returned}} to Olympia where they {{joined forces with}} Donna Dresch's Queercore label Chainsaw Records. The Need's unsettling brand of cyborgian deconstructive art rock (and Carns' distinctive artwork) both set them apart and ensured their versatility; they played shows at venues such as DUMBA with such diverse acts as Glass Candy, Tribe 8, Fugazi, and The Ex, and toured with Le Tigre, BS 2000, and Blonde Redhead. Joe Preston joined the band briefly, playing bass and sampler. During this period Carns played drums with The Sub-Debs and later with The Spells. Carns and Sloan both briefly joined Mocket, then Two Ton Boa. With singer Nomy Lamm, the duo formed a highly theatrical surf-garage-punk drag king band called The Teenage Ho-Dads. They also dreamt up the collaborative project KaraNEEDoke, where Carns and Sloan and a rotating cast of players formed a live karaoke band for guest singers. <b>This</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community involvement, DIY spirit, and willingness to experiment {{led to the creation}} of The Transfused, a full-length rock opera, written with librettist Nomy Lamm. Twelve months in the making, with an original score by Carns and Sloan, a cast of 25, a full backing band, $40,000 in grassroots fundraising, months of rehearsals, and literally hundreds of volunteers, The Transfused sold out its two-week run at Olympia's Capitol Theater in summer 2000. The first-ever Ladyfest took place in Olympia a month later; Carns organized and emceed the punk cabaret-style Dude-Looks-Like-A-Lady drag show. Soon after, Sloan relocated to Los Angeles; The Need added a new bass player, Dvin Kirakosian, and for a while Carns spent alternate months in Olympia and LA. Their final album, prophetically titled The Need Is Dead, had been released in 2000; the band broke up within a year.|$|E
50|$|Digital scent {{technology}} (or olfactory technology) is {{the engineering}} discipline dealing with olfactory representation. It is a technology to sense, transmit and receive scent-enabled digital media (such as web pages, video games, movies and music). <b>This</b> <b>sensing</b> part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> technology works by using olfactometers and electronic noses.|$|R
