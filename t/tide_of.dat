5|$|In Texas, Bertha {{produced}} a storm <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> 3feet (.9m) at Baffin Bay. Only light rainfall {{occurred in the}} state, with a few isolated areas receiving over 1inch (25mm) of precipitation.|$|E
5|$|October 8, 1996- Tropical Storm Josephine {{strikes the}} eastern portion of Apalachicola Bay with winds of 70mph (115km/h), {{producing}} a peak storm <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> 9.3feet (2.8m) in Suwannee and spawning at least 16tornadoes. A tornado in Edgewater severely damages 30houses, with {{the storm surge}} resulting in widespread coastal flooding.|$|E
5|$|September 25, 1992– Tropical Storm Danielle makes {{landfall}} on the Delmarva Peninsula, producing {{winds of}} 53mph (85km/h) in Ocean City.

5|$|The India Meteorological Department {{estimated}} {{winds of}} 45–55km/h (28–34mph) affected the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, though no land reports were received. In Sittwe in Burma, the storm produced a storm <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> 3m (10ft), which flooded coastal areas.|$|E
5|$|As the {{precursor}} tropical disturbance crossed southern Florida, it dropped light rainfall of over 1 inch (25 mm) in the Miami area. Later, as a developing tropical depression, the system produced gusty winds and heavy rainfall in southern Louisiana; one station near Galliano reported over 3 inches (76 mm) of precipitation. Hurricane Anita produced a storm <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> 2 feet (0.6 m) above normal in Grand Isle, {{which resulted in}} hundreds of families being asked to leave their homes.|$|E

5|$|Cutthroat {{competition}} {{was nothing to}} what was to follow. The 1890s were a tough time for the Romanian economy, and a rising <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> anti-Semitism made it an even tougher time for the Jews. One quarter of the Jewish population emigrated, with intellectuals particularly likely to leave, and those intellectuals who remained {{were more interested in}} politics than in theater: this was a period of social ferment, with Jewish socialists in Iaşi starting Der Veker (The Awakener).|$|E
5|$|Doria passed near {{or through}} the {{northern}} Caribbean Islands and the Bahamas as a tropical depression, though effects, if any, are unknown. Tropical Storm Doria passed about 160miles (260km) east of Charleston, South Carolina, though its large wind field produced 22mph (35km/h) winds in the town. The storm also dropped light rainfall of up to 1.75inches (44mm), and resulted in a storm <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> 5.7feet (1.7m) above the mean low water level.|$|E
5|$|In February 1217, Louis {{set sail}} for France to gather reinforcements. In his absence, {{arguments}} broke out between Louis' French and English followers, and Cardinal Guala declared that Henry's {{war against the}} rebels {{was the equivalent of}} a religious crusade. This declaration resulted in a series of defections from the rebel movement, and the <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> the conflict swung in Henry's favour. Louis returned at the end of April, but his northern forces were defeated by William Marshal at the Battle of Lincoln in May.|$|E

5|$|Isabel {{produced}} {{strong winds}} throughout inland areas of eastern North Carolina. Plymouth, located 75miles (120km) {{from where the}} hurricane made landfall, reported gusts to 95mph (155km/h). Sustained winds were lighter, {{with only a few}} locations receiving tropical storm strength winds. The passage of the hurricane resulted in moderate rainfall of up to 6.02inches (153mm) in Havelock. Upon making landfall, Isabel produced moderate to severe storm surges along the Pamlico and Neuse Rivers, with a location in Craven County reporting a storm <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> 10.5feet (3.2m) above normal.|$|E
5|$|July 11, 1996- Hurricane Bertha {{parallels}} {{the east coast}} of Florida about 175miles (280km) offshore, producing a storm <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> 2feet (0.6m) at Jacksonville Beach, as well as rip currents along the coast. Two people drown in rip currents in Miami Beach, and one pilot dies indirectly due to the storm when an evacuating military jet crashes into a house.|$|E
5|$|The decisive {{victory of}} Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery's Eighth Army over the Germans and Italians at the Second Battle of El Alamein in October–November 1942 turned the <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> the North African war {{strongly}} {{in favour of}} the Allies, and did much to revive Allied morale.

5|$|The {{fight at}} P'ohang-dong {{was the final}} {{breaking}} point for North Korean units already {{on the verge of}} exhaustion from continuous combat. North Korean supply lines were overextended to the point of breaking down, causing a collapse in resupply that is seen as a primary factor in turning the <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> the battle. Moreover, U.S. air superiority was also crucial to the engagement, since repeated bombing runs by U.S. aircraft prevented North Korean ground forces from reaching and holding their objectives.|$|E
5|$|The first combat {{involving}} battlecruisers during World War I was the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914. A {{force of}} British light cruisers and destroyers entered the Heligoland Bight (the {{part of the}} North Sea closest to Hamburg) to attack German destroyer patrols. When they met opposition from light cruisers, Vice Admiral David Beatty took his squadron of five battlecruisers into the Bight and turned the <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> the battle, ultimately sinking three German light cruisers and killing their commander, Rear Admiral Leberecht Maass.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{produced}} heavy surf {{along the}} western coastline, {{as well as a}} storm <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> 4.78feet (1.46m) at Clearwater Beach. The wave action caused minor beach erosion, with 50–60feet (15–18m) of sand washed away at Bradenton Beach. The increased ocean action caused minor flooding along several roads in the Tampa Bay area, which trapped some automobile travelers. At Indian Shores, a woman died after sustaining injuries from the rough surf.|$|E
