500|$|Play.d {{magazine}} credited Smith with inspiring gamers {{to learn}} more about the game industry and not accept company promotion, as well as turning 1UP from [...] "the bastard child of EGM" [...] to an important part of the Ziff Davis Internet company's gaming network. His style has been described as a [...] "robust, direct approach" [...] to journalism and is known for his scathing attacks on the industry. Smith, however, felt disheartened by the state of game journalism. [...] "Video game journalism is just weird. You have guys married to women in marketing for the games they cover. Video game journalism is still very young, very early, still <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> it is," [...] he said. In an interview with Michael Zenke of The Escapist, Smith said he felt game journalists were treated by developers as another part of the PR plan, with developers sending out information and the journalists [...] "regurgitating" [...] it. Worse, Smith felt that gamers had become used to this sort of information; [...] "We have to be responsible for our actions and held accountable when we manipulate the expectations of gamers," [...] he told Zenke.|$|E

Cavill is the first British and non-American actor to play the character. He was previously cast in , which was ultimately shelved, and was considered for the role in the 2006 film Superman Returns, but lost to Brandon Routh. Cavill stated, [...] "There's a very real story behind the Superman character." [...] He explained that everyone's goal has been to explore the difficulties his character faces as a result of having multiple identities – including his birth name, Kal-El, and his alter ego, Clark Kent. Cavill also stated that, [...] "He's alone and there's no one like him," [...] referring to Superman's vulnerabilities. [...] "That must be incredibly scary and lonely, not to know who you are or what you are, and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> makes sense. Where's your baseline? What do you draw from? Where do you draw a limit with the power you have? In itself, that's an incredible weakness." [...] In an interview with Total Film magazine, Cavill stated he had been consuming nearly 5,000 calories a day, training for over two hours daily and plowing protein to pack on the muscle mass. Joe Manganiello was considered for the role but could not work out an audition date for the casting director due to scheduling obligations with True Blood. Cooper Timberline was cast as the 9-year-old Clark Kent, and Dylan Sprayberry was cast as the 13-year-old Clark Kent.|$|E
