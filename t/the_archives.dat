The first holder of the post was Brian Twyne, who prepared an index of <b>the</b> <b>archives</b> in 1631 {{as part of the}} preparatory work for the statutes: he was appointed Keeper of <b>the</b> <b>Archives</b> as a reward for his work. <b>The</b> <b>archives</b> were moved from the University Church of St Mary the Virgin into the Tower of the Five Orders in the Bodleian Library under Twyne and his successor, and some of the storage cupboards built at that time are still in use. <b>The</b> <b>archives</b> include charters, title deeds, university registers and records, and other official documentation from the university (but not from the colleges of the university, which keep their own archives). Most of the material dates from the 19th and 20th centuries, with few photographs and no sound or video recordings.|$|E

5|$|The {{position}} of Keeper of <b>the</b> <b>Archives</b> at the University of Oxford dates from 1634. The university's records pre-date this, and it {{claims to have}} one of the longest continuous record-keeping traditions in Britain. Records were initially kept in the Priory of St Frideswide (the site of the present-day Christ Church), moving to the University Church of St Mary the Virgin in the 14th century, where they were housed with money and other valuables. <b>The</b> <b>archives</b> were left in considerable disarray by a burglary in 1544, and remained in chaos until Brian Twyne attended to them in the 17th century. As part of his work {{as a member of the}} committee preparing new statutes for the university (at the request of the Chancellor of the University, William Laud), Twyne prepared an index of <b>the</b> <b>archives</b> by 1631, and was appointed the first Keeper of <b>the</b> <b>Archives</b> under the revised statutes in 1634 as a reward for his work. Under Twyne and Gerard Langbaine, his successor as Keeper, <b>the</b> <b>archives</b> were moved into one of the rooms in the Tower of the Five Orders in the Bodleian Library; three of the wooden cupboards that were built at that time to store them are still in use.|$|E

5|$|According to Viktor Luneyev, the {{struggle}} against dissent operated on many more layers than those registered in court sentences.

No objective assessment {{of the total number of}} repressed persons is possible without fundamental analysis of archival documents. The difficulty is that the required data are very diverse and are not to be found in a single archive. They are scattered between the State Archive of the Russian Federation, the archive of the Russian Federation State Statistical Committee (Goskomstat), <b>the</b> <b>archives</b> of the RF Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD of Russia), the FSB of Russia, the RF General Prosecutor's Office, and the Russian Military and Historical Archive.
