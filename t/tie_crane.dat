The {{end of the}} lifting arm has a gripper for picking up sleepers, and a movable wrist to allow the tie to be positioned. Often a small trolley {{is connected to the}} <b>tie</b> <b>crane</b> by a drawbar, for either storage of new sleepers to be placed into the track, or for taking away old sleepers that have been removed.|$|E

40|$|The role {{corporations}} {{should play}} in society {{in terms of}} their social engagement and ethical responsibilities has been increasingly questioned in recent times (Aßländer & Curbach, 2014; Buchholtz & Carroll, 2009; Leisinger, 2009). Stakeholders’ expectations are reconfiguring the rationale and the dynamics of business-society relations (Logsdon & Wood, 2002; Matten & Crane, 2005) since corporations are now recognizing that it is their duty to fulfil obligations to society rather than to just government (Stokes, 2002). This imbues firms with an ethical ethos that leads to corporation social responsiveness (Fukukawa, Balmer, & Gray, 2007) to include stakeholders in processes and structures related to strategic management to better respond to expectations (Palazzo & Basu, 2007; Vallaster, Lindgreen, & Maon, 2012). Therefore, beyond their engagement as responsible players in respect to the law, corporations are claimed to act as if they were metaphorically citizens in that their commitments to society resemble those of citizens (Moon, Crane, & Matten, 2005). Citizenship emphasizes participation in the public good by fostering community <b>ties</b> (<b>Crane,</b> Matten, & Moon, 2004; Wood, Logsdon, Lewellyn, & Davenport, 2006), and honest and respectful engagement of stakeholders as a vital part a viable firm’s strategy (Noland & Phillips, 2010) informed by the ongoing exchange between business and society jointly shaping purposes, rights, and duties (Bhattacharya, Korschun, &Sen, 2009). In that sense stakeholder engagement (SE) has been understood as a mutually beneficial and just scheme of cooperation which {{takes the form of a}} moral partnership of equals (Phillips, 1997) based on collaborative work for the sake of the common good (Sison & Fontrodona, 2012). In this working paper we dig into the existing controversial conceptualizations of SE, which according to dominant perspectives is torn between moral and strategic motives...|$|R

50|$|When the fill got large enough, {{the track}} was {{relocated}} {{on top of}} the old fill to allow almost continuous unloading of new fill with minimal effort. When the steam shovels or dirt trains needed to move to a new section, techniques were developed by William Bierd, former head of the Panama Railroad, to pick up large sections of track and their attached <b>ties</b> by steam-powered <b>cranes</b> and relocate them intact, without disassembling and rebuilding the track. A dozen men could move a mile of track a day — the work previously done by up to 600 men. This allowed the tracks used by both the steam shovels and dirt trains to be quickly moved to wherever they needed to go. While constructing the Culebra Cut (Gaillard Cut), about 160 loaded dirt trains went out daily and returned empty — or about one train every 90 seconds.|$|R
25|$|The 2010–11 season {{saw little}} {{change to the}} make-up or {{schedule}} of the league. High1 made significant changes to their defensive side by acquiring three new goalies and four new defencemen. The team also acquired three new forwards. Three of the changes were to the team's, imports with only Tim Smith remaining on the team. High1 faced Halla in the Korea Domestic Championship and lost {{the game with a}} score of 5-1. Also in November, one of the team's imports, Alex Bourret left the team to return to Canada, citing concern over the relations between North and South Korea. Even though Bourret played only 16 games, he led the league with 106 minutes in penalties. Hiroki Ueno led the team in plus-minus with a +34 on the season. Ueno Also led the team in goals with 23, which secured him third place in the league rankings. Tim Smith led the team in assists with 29 which allowed him to finish fifth in the league and both Ueno and Smith finished with 45 points overall tying for seventh in the league. High1 finished the season with 51 points and in fifth place, marking the first time that they missed the play-offs since their first year in the league. They won their season series against the Dragon and Ice Bucks, as well as <b>tying</b> the <b>Cranes,</b> but were swept all six games by the Eagles. They finished fourth in goals scored with 131, but allowed the second most goals with 112. The team was ranked fifth on the powerplay but allowed the fewest shorthanded goals of any team, only relinquishing a single goal all season. High1 also ranked fourth on the penalty goal but scored the second most shorthanded goals with five. The team played 13 of their 18 home games in Goyang.|$|R
