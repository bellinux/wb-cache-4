The flags of British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island are banners of the provincial arms, while Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Saskatchewan, the Northwest Territories, and the Yukon each have <b>the</b> <b>shield</b> of the local coat of arms on their flags, with other design elements. The flag of Nunavut uses some elements from its coat of arms along with other symbols and colours. <b>The</b> <b>shield</b> of the arms of each province, on a blue background and circled with ten gold maple leaves, the whole surmounted by a crown, forms the main element of {{the flag of the}} Lieutenant-Governor of that province.

5|$|On the December 3 Raw, Orton began a {{feud with}} <b>The</b> <b>Shield,</b> {{after he was}} {{attacked}} by them following a victory over Brad Maddox. On the December 14 SmackDown, Orton was once again assaulted backstage by <b>The</b> <b>Shield.</b> This was used to write him off television due to a shoulder injury. Orton returned on the New Yearâ€™s Eve Raw, helping Ryback and Sheamus fend off <b>The</b> <b>Shield.</b> On the January 4 SmackDown, Orton declared his entry in the 2013 Royal Rumble match. On the January 11 SmackDown and the January 16 Main Event, Orton was again attacked by <b>The</b> <b>Shield</b> during his matches with Antonio Cesaro. On the February 1 SmackDown, Orton defeated longtime rival Wade Barrett to earn {{a spot in the}} Elimination Chamber match. On February 17 at Elimination Chamber, Orton eliminated Mark Henry and Chris Jericho before being the last man eliminated by Jack Swagger. In late February, Orton aligned himself with Sheamus to feud with <b>the</b> <b>Shield.</b> Over the next weeks, Orton and Sheamus saved each other from attacks by <b>The</b> <b>Shield</b> and Big Show. On the March 15 SmackDown, Orton and Sheamus were then allowed to pick a third partner to face <b>the</b> <b>Shield</b> in a six-man tag team match at Wrestlemania 29 an chose Ryback. Three days later on Raw, however, Ryback was booked in another match for the event, leaving the spot open. Later that night, Big Show saved the two from an attack by <b>The</b> <b>Shield</b> and was immediately recruited as their partner. On April 7 at WrestleMania 29, Orton, Sheamus and Show were defeated by <b>The</b> <b>Shield,</b> after which, both men were knocked out by Show. The following night on Raw, Orton and Sheamus faced off in a match to earn a match with Big Show, however, the match ended in a no contest after Show interfered. Orton and Sheamus then teamed up to defeat Show in two handicap matches, first on the April 12 SmackDown via count-out, and second on the April 15 Raw via pinfall. On the April 19 SmackDown, Orton and Sheamus were defeated by Big Show and Mark Henry in a tag team match. The feud between Big Show and Orton led to an Extreme Rules match at Extreme Rules, which Orton won.|$|E

However, sufficient shielding gas coverage of the weld region is essential for the generation of high quality welds, and drafts can be detrimental to its efficiency. In industry, the general practise to ensure coverage is to increase <b>the</b> <b>shielding</b> gas flow rate, however, too high a flow rate can induce undesirable turbulence in <b>the</b> <b>shielding</b> gas column, whilst adding unnecessary cost to the process.

40|$|Negative skin {{friction}} (NSF) can induce an increased compressive force on piles, called dragload, and additional pile settlement {{caused by the}} downward pull of the soil, called downdrag. To investigate <b>the</b> efficiency of <b>shielding</b> effects on dragload and downdrag of piles, centrifuge tests {{have been carried out}} to study <b>the</b> <b>shielding</b> mechanisms created by installing sheet piles sleeves around an existing pile in consolidating ground. The effects of various shielded lengths have also been investigated. Comparisons between centrifuge test results and finite-element (FE) analyses are made and discussed. Based on centrifuge tests, it is clear that <b>the</b> <b>shielding</b> effect on <b>the</b> dragload decreases only gently with a decrease in <b>the</b> <b>shielded</b> length, whereas <b>the</b> <b>shielding</b> effect on <b>the</b> downdrag decreases exponentially with a decrease in <b>the</b> <b>shielded</b> length. Numerical simulations of the centrifuge model tests on the sleeved center piles reveal that <b>the</b> observed <b>shielding</b> effects on <b>the</b> center pile are attributed to the stress transfer from the consolidating soft soil to the sheet pile sleeve. As consolidation proceeds, the relatively stiff sheet piles sleeve hangs up the soil, leading to a significant reduction in the vertical and horizontal effective stresses in the soil and in the NSF on the center piles. The deeper the depth, the greater the hang-up effects. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>shielding</b> effect increases with <b>the</b> <b>shielded</b> length of <b>the</b> center pile. The reduction in the NSF on the center piles protected by the sheet pile sleeve is more significant than the reduction in the NSF from the sacrificial piles with <b>the</b> same <b>shielded</b> length.
