In 1928, he joined Bell Laboratories, where he worked mostly on vacuum tubes, including improvements of Radar during World War II. [...] He developed a gas-discharge <b>transmit-receive</b> <b>switch</b> (TR tube) that allowed a single antenna {{to be used for}} both transmitting and receiving.After the war he moved to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he initiated the ILLIAC project, but left before its first computer was complete.Samuel went to IBM in Poughkeepsie, New York in 1949, where he would conceive and carry out his most successful work. He is credited with one of the first software hash tables, and influencing early research in using transistors for computers at IBM.At IBM he made the first checkers program on IBM's first commercial computer, the IBM 701. The program was a sensational demonstration of the advances in both hardware and skilled programming and caused IBM's stock to increase 15 points overnight.

5000|$|The FPS-16 system {{originally}} {{planned for the}} Project Mercury tracking network did not have adequate displays and controls for reliably acquiring the spacecraft in the acquisition time available. Consequently, a contract was negotiated with a manufacturer to provide the instrumentation radar acquisition (IRACQ)RAnge Acquisition modifications. For the near earth spacecraft involved a major limitation of the FPS-16 was its mechanical range gear box, a wonderful piece of engineering. However, for a target at a range typically, say, [...] at acquisition of signal AOS, the radar was tracking second time around, that is, the pulse received in this interpulse period was that due to the previously transmitted pulse, {{and it would be}} indicating a range of [...] As the range closed the return pulse became {{closer and closer to the}} time at which the next transmitter pulse should occur. If they were allowed to coincide, remembering that the <b>transmit-receive</b> <b>switch</b> disconnected the receive (Rx) and connected the transmit (Tx) to the antenna at that instant, track would be lost. So, IRACQ provided an electronic ranging system, the function of which was to provide the necessary gating pulses to the Az and El receiver channels so that the system would maintain angle track. The system utilized a voltage controlled crystal oscillator VCXO as the clock generator for the range counters. An early/late gate system derived an error voltage which either increased a closing target or decreased an opening target the clock frequency, thus causing the gates to be generated so as to track the target. It also, when the target reached an indicated range of less than 16000 yd, took over the generation of transmitter trigger pulses and delayed these by 16000 yd, thus enabling the received pulses to pass through the Big Bang, as it was called, of normally timed Tx pulses. The radar operator, would, while IRACQ maintained angle track be slewing the range system from minimum range to maximum so as to regain track of the target at its true range of <500 nmi (900 km). As the target passed through point of closest approach (PCA) and increased in range the process was repeated at maximum range indication. The most difficult passes were those in which the orbit was such that the target came to PCA at a range of, say 470 nmi. That pass required the radar operator to work very hard as the radar closed, and then opened in range through the Big Bang in short order. The IRACQ Console contained a C-scope associated with which was a small joy stick which gave C-scope operator control of the antenna angle servo systems so that he could adjust the pointing angle to acquire the signal. IRACQ included a scan generator which drove the antenna in one of several pre-determined search patterns around the nominal pointing position, it being desirable that IRACQ acquire the target as early as possible. An essential feature of this modification is that it allows examination of all incoming video signals and allows establishment of angle-only track. Once the spacecraft has been acquired, in angle range. Other features of the IRACQ system included additional angle scan modes and radar phasing controls to permit multiple radar interrogation of the spacecraft beacon. The addition of a beacon local oscillator wave meter permitted the determination of spacecraft-transmitter frequency drift.|$|E

With this setup, <b>transmit-receive</b> <b>switching</b> is achieved within 1 µs, radiofrequency (RF) excitation is performed in 3 µs, and digital bandpass filtering takes 5. 3 µs, resulting in an effective dead time of only 5 µs.

50|$|A major {{features}} of the radar was its maximum unambiguous range of 32768 nmi km despite a pulse repetition frequency PRFof some hundreds of pulses per second.To combine these two features requires that the radar carry out nth time around tracking, that is, {{it had to be}} able to track an echo resulting from a transmitted pulse other than that sent as the start of the same PRF period in which the echo was received.In order to do so the range system employed a 2-second time base which allowed the system to determine the number of PRF periods elapsing before an echo, resulting from a particular transmit (Tx) pulse was received. The range system carried out a find process, then a verify process before entering the auto-tracking mode. All the following discussion uses ranges in yards—the radar was designed to work in those units and converting them to metric units would not add any clarity to this description.The FIND process is first carried out. In this process two successive Tx trigger pulses are delayed by a time equivalent to an RF wave go and return distance of 16,000 yd. Then the range gate triggers are delayed by an equivalent time. The delayed Tx trigger pulses are counted in an auxiliary counter, the zone counter, until target video pulses are detected in the delayed range gates. At this point the zone counter contains the number of PRF periods corresponding to the nth time around.The VERIFY process is then entered. In this mode one Tx pulse is delayed for a 16,000 yd equivalent distance. The range gate in the zone determined in the FIND mode is also delayed to match the TX delay. This sequence is repeated until four video returns, from eight attempts, are received. When the four returns are detected automatic tracking is maintained. The contents of the zone counter are added to the apparent range, that is the range reported in the current PRF period, to determine the actual range of the target.If, during the Verify process four returns are not found after eight tries the Find process is re-initiated.Take this example, in which a PRF of 142 PPS is assumed: A target at a range of 4,883,072 yd is to be acquired.At the radar console the operator initiates the FIND mode, and the system carries out that process by delaying triggers, counting zones etc., as described above, and finds that the zone counter has stored a count of four. The VERIFY mode then takes place, resulting in confirmation of the zone count. The target will appear, on the radar display to be at a range of 265,200 yd, that is the difference between, in this case, four PRF period equivalents, plus the additional range. The range reported will be the actual target range of 4,883,072 yd, the figure displayed on the range read-out. As the radar was designed to track moving objects the need arose to handle targets which, in closing or opening range, during nth time around tracking, came into coincidence with the next Tx pulse.So, in the jargon, the radar had to be capable of tracking “through the Big Bang.” This arises from the fact that the antenna serves both the Tx and Rx. To allow this to happen a device called the <b>Transmit-Receive</b> <b>Switch</b> Switchis used. The antenna is connected to the Rx until the Tx is pulsed. The T-R Switch detects the Tx pulse and transfers the antenna to the Tx for the duration of the pulse, say, 1 microsecond. period is that in which a radio wave would travel 164 yd. Remember we are talking here of radar ranges, the total go and return distance.At the instant the Rx is disconnected from the antenna the range system will lose track.In order for an Nth time around tracking system to work there has to be some arrangement to cover the loss of Rx signal for the Tx pulse period.In the radar under discussion this is achieved as follows. When the target pulse reaches an apparent range of ±16,000 yd of the Tx pulse a number of Tx pulse, the number being the zone count, are delayed by a time equivalent to 32,000 yd. Take our example above. When the range of the target reduces to 4,633,872 yd-that is 16,000 yd greater than the 4 zones, the 32,000 yd delay is introduced into the Tx system. After 4 pulses the delay is transferred into the range gate generation system, and the target continues to be tracked. After the target has reached a range of 4,601,872 yd, 4 zones minus 16,000 yd, the delay is removed from the system. At that point the range is such that the zone counter will have been decremented by 1 and the apparent range will be 1,138,468 yd, but with the target at a real range of 3 zones plus the apparent range. Obviously, for an opening target the zone counter will be incremented and the apparent range will be slightly more than 16 yd.|$|E

40|$|MRI {{with zero}} echo {{time is a}} robust, fast, and silent {{approach}} for three-dimensional (3 -D) imaging of samples with short transverse relaxation times. In this article, the principles of acquiring and reconstructing data with zero echo time are described and complemented by discussions of implementation details, potential limitations, and selected applications, as well as advanced and related techniques. MR imaging of samples with very short T 2 s requires spatial encoding and data acquisition to be started and completed rapidly after signal creation. One powerful way of meeting these requirements is with 3 -D radial center-out k-space encoding. In particular, when RF excitation is performed after switching on the projection gradient, such schemes achieve an echo time of zero and immediately have available maximum k-space speed. MRI with zero echo time poses two major challenges. First, RF pulses need to be of high bandwidth to uniformly excite {{the full range of}} Larmor frequencies induced by the projection gradient. Second, <b>transmit–receive</b> <b>switching</b> results in an initial period of dead time, because of which a certain range of data in the center of k-space is not acquired.

40|$|Radio-frequency (RF) {{switches}} {{are widely}} used in electrical systems, telecommunications, and wireless applications. In RF systems, it is often desirable to change the signal path effectively, by us-ing couplers, duplexers, and RF switches for signal division and combining. Typically, in modern RF systems, the RF switch is mostly capitalized {{in order to reduce}} the RF footprint but with efficient switch characteristics. A simple method to reduce transceiver space requirement is to integrate RF switches with the frontend module on a single chip. Recent advances in Gallium Nitride (GaN) technology allows RF designers to design faster, smaller, and efficient components using this technology. With high data rates in demand for wireless communication systems, wideband characteristics are needed in modern systems [1]. Therefore, it is desirable to design wideband circuits; such as, mixers, amplifiers, and switches. In this work, a comprehensive study of NRC GaN 150 HEMT is conducted to design broadband RF switches. Single pole and double pole switch topologies operating at 1 - 12 GHz are designed to evaluate GaN 0. 15 μm RF switches. The main objectives were to design compact sized switches, while having high power handling, low insertion loss, high isolation and high return loss. Additionally, a <b>transmit-receive</b> <b>switch</b> is designed for integration into a frontend module and further fabricated to operate at 10 GHz. There are many applications of RF switches in an RF transceiver, one of which is an impedance tuner. Impedance tuner are attractive for many applications where mobile devices are used for wireless communications. As mobile technology continues to evolve, they are designed to be com-pact, leaving minimal space for the antenna. Consequently, the radiating element is often electrically small and sensitive to near-field coupling requiring tuning. Matching networks aim to tune matching conditions; for example, loading effects due to human hand [2]. For such situations, specialized matching networks can be designed to account for specific loading environmental effects. However, for mobile systems, the environment is unknown; thereby, yielding unpredictable antenna loading, especially for electrically small antennas that have rapidly changing real and imaginary impedance. As a result, it is necessary to design a reconfigurable impedance-matching network to account for possible load impedances. In this work, a 16 -bit reconfigurable impedance tuner design comprising of passive microwave components and NRC GaN 0. 15 μm FET operating at X-band is presented to evaluate its performance for integration with the frontend module on a single chip to reduce cost and increase efficiency of the system...|$|E
40|$|Zero echo {{time can}} be {{obtained}} in MRI by performing radiofrequency (RF) excitation as well as acquisition {{in the presence of}} a constant gradient applied for purely frequency-encoded, radial centre-out k-space encoding. In this approach, the spatially nonselective excitation must uniformly cover the full frequency bandwidth spanned by the readout gradient. This can be accomplished either by short, hard RF pulses or by pulses with a frequency sweep as used in the SWIFT (Sweep imaging with Fourier transform) method for improved performance at limited RF amplitudes. In this work, the two options are compared with respect to T 2 sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and SNR efficiency. In particular, the SNR implications of sweep excitation and of initial or periodical acquisition gaps required for <b>transmit-receive</b> <b>switching</b> are investigated. It was found by simulations and experiments that, whereas equivalent in terms of T 2 sensitivity, the two techniques differ in SNR performance. With ideal, ungapped simultaneous excitation and acquisition, the sweep approach would yield higher SNR throughout due to larger feasible flip angles. However, acquisition gapping is found to take a significant SNR toll related to a reduced acquisition duty cycle, rendering hard pulse excitation superior for sufficient RF amplitude and also in the short-T 2 limit...|$|R

In addition, radar could detect the submarine at a much greater range than visual observation, both in the daylight and at night, when submarines had previously considered themselves safe to surface and recharge their batteries. Centimetric contour mapping radars like H2S, and the even higher frequency American-created H2X, allowed new tactics in the strategic bombing campaign. Centimetric gun-laying radars were much more accurate than the older technology. Allied naval gunnery improved and, along with the proximity fuze, radar made anti-aircraft guns much more effective.

50|$|Where radio {{transmitters}} and receivers {{share one}} antenna, often a coaxial relay {{is used as}} a TR (<b>transmit-receive)</b> relay, which <b>switches</b> the antenna from the receiver to the transmitter.

The entrainment zone {{at the top of the}} ABL acts as a lid on rising (and cooling) air parcels due to temperature inversion. An external mechanism such as geographically forced uplift, vigorous surface heating or dry lines, can break the entrainment layer, allowing the capped air parcels to rise freely.

ABL research and studies help (i) develop and improve existing numerical weather prediction models, (ii) understand the transfer of heat, water vapor and momentum between the Earth and the atmosphere, (iii) refine the analytical description of turbulent processes and (iv) quantify the absorption and emission in the troposphere, which is a major factor in shaping climate on Earth. The effect of the troposphere on wave propagation has also been studied extensively for the purposes of improving radio communications. The main reason for FMCW radar development is the need for continuous monitoring of the winds and fields in the atmosphere, improving in-situ measurements. Conventional radar profiler technologies are usually able to make atmospheric measurements of the boundary layer, but preclude the lower part of the ABL, (around 150 meters). The Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave, Spaced Antenna (FMCWSA) Radar, that is being developed in University of Massachusetts - Amherst, at the Microwave Sensing Laboratory (MIRSL), will allow measurements of the lower part of the ABL. The use of FMCW radars is introduced in order to improve the limitations of pulsed radars. Pulsed radars are limited by the pulse-width and switching speed of the <b>transmit-receive</b> <b>switches</b> because of the use of common antennas for both functions. The pulsed nature of the radar dictates a higher transmitter power, and consequently the need for switches that are both faster and high powered. FMCW radar alleviate this problem by using separate antennas for transmit and receive, which also allows use at short ranges. The problem in dual-antenna systems is parallax at low altitudes due to the spatially separated antenna apertures, and some uncertainty in the actual sampling volume.

Methods: The spatial response function (SRF) and noise covariance resulting from ZTE reconstruction were studied using formal analysis, simulations, and phantom experiments. Results: Three prominent limiting phenomena were identified: SRF behavior within the field of view, heightened sensitivity to out-of-band signal sources, and noise amplification. The related errors all appear as image distortions of low spatial frequency and are strongly attenuated upon the transition from one-dimensional projections to 3 D image data. Relying on these observations, ZTE imaging was accomplished with a previously unreached gap size, permitting the depiction of a solid sample with T 2 ≈ 25 µs at a bandwidth of 500 kHz.

First, an in-depth {{analysis of a}} SiGe BiCMOS on-off keying (OOK) receiver composed of a low noise SiGe amplifier and an OOK detector is presented. The analysis indicates that the bias circuit and bias current have a substantial impact on the receiver and should be optimized for best performance. Also, the LO leakage from the transmitter can have a detrimental impact on the receiver sensitivity and should be minimized for best performance. The receiver consumes 11 mW, has a noise equivalent power (NEP) of 5 - 10 fW/rtHz¹/² at 55 GHz, and an instantaneous dynamic range of 27 - 30 dB. The OOK receiver achieves 6 Gb/s communication with a bit-error rate (BER) 25 dB, and the output port-to-port isolation is > 27 dB at 50 - 70 GHz. The measured P 1 dB is 13. 5 dBm with a corresponding IIP 3 of 22. 5 dBm at 60 GHz. The return loss is better than - 8 dB at 50 - 70 GHz. The active chip area is 0. 5 x 0. 55 mm² and can be reduced in future designs by folding the quarter- wave transmission lines. When this work was published, it presented the lowest insertion loss 60 GHz SPDT in any CMOS technology to-date. 140 - 220 GHz single-pole single- throw (SPST) and single-pole double-throw (SPDT) switches built using 45 nm semiconductor-on-insulator (SOI) CMOS technology are presented. A tuned-shunt topology is used to minimize the insertion loss, and the transistor layout results in very low ground inductance and high isolation. The double-shunt SPST switch results in an insertion loss of 1. 0 dB and an isolation of 20 dB, while the SPDT switches result in an insertion loss of 3. 0 dB and an isolation of 20 - 25 dB, all at 180 GHz.

The main reason for the radar development is the need of continous monitoring of the winds and elds in the atmosphere, improving the in-situ measurements. Conven- tional radar pro ler technologies usually are able to make atmospheric measurements of the boundary layer, but precluding the lower part of the ABL, (around 150 meters). The Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave, Spaced Antenna (FMCW-SA) Radar, that is being developed in University of Massachusetts - Amherst, at the Microwave Sensing Laboratory (MIRSL), will allow measurements of the lower part of the ABL. The use of FMCW radars is introduced in order to improved the limitations of pulsed radars. Pulsed radars are limited by the pulse-width and switching speed of the <b>transmit-receive</b> <b>switches</b> because of the use of a common antennas for both functions. The pulsed nature of the radar dictates a high transmitter power, and consequently the need for switches that are both faster and high powered. FMCW radar alleviate this problem by using separate antennas for transmit and receive, also being able to be used at short ranges. The problem in dual-antenna systems is parallax at low altitudes due to the spatially separated antenna apertures, and some uncertainty in the actual sampling volume. The primary objective of this thesis, is to explain the previous results and the problems encountered on the FMCW Wind Pro ler Radar, and to provide a detailed account of the work one in order to x remaining issues. Several problems were encountered on the radar's receiver. Noise and leakage were still not allowing the radar to achieve sensitivity enough to work properly. To solve it, the receiver was modi ed. This thesis, provides a detailed account of modi cations including a new audio-module, modi ed FPGA and tests to report conclusions...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} two {{separate}} fields of microwave technology. The first section treats microwave characterization and applications of high temperature superconducting (HTS) thin films, {{while the second}} section treats microwave breakdown in <b>transmit-receive</b> (TR) <b>switches</b> and in air. Within the first section, four main topics are adressed. The first topic deals with non-destructive characterization of the surface impedance of HTS films. Two methods are investigated: the dielectric rod resonator method and the parallel-plate resonator method. Calibration measurements show that surface resistance measurements can be performed at 10 GHz {{in the range from}} 15 µ. OMEGA. to 100 µ. OMEGA. using both methods. Good agreement is obtained between a microstrip resonator method and the two non-destructive methods. The parallel-plate resonator is used as a fast non-destructive microwave characterization method for YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 (YBCO) films grown on (001) yttria-stabilized ZrO 2 substrates, in order to optimize film deposition parameters. The second topic involves an analytical formulation for calculation of the quasi-static propagation parameters of HTS coplanar waveguides and striplines. The resistance and kinetic inductance per unit length of the line is calculated for HTS film thicknesses comparable to the penetration depth. The third topic deals with a YBCO microstrip modulator, which is based on the transition from the superconductive (S) state to the normal (N) state of current controlled YBCO film elements. The elements are used as terminations of a 3 dB hybrid coupler and work as shorts or terminations depending on state. The actual material parameters of the used YBCO films differ most likely from those used in the simulations, which can be deduced from the small measured difference in insertion loss between the S- and N-states. The fourth topic involves measurements and modeling of the frequency and quality factor of high quality YBCO thin film coplanar resonators as function of dc bias in the center strip conductor. Agreement between experiments and the results of a current-dependent coupled-grain model has been obtained. Within the second section, two topics are investigated. The first topic deals with a detailed theoretical and experimental investigation of the TR switch. It is shown that the characteristic physical phenomena which appear in connection with microwave breakdown of the filling gas as well as the subsequent interaction between the microwave and the breakdown plasma, can be described very well in terms of qualitative and quantitative physical models. The theoretical results are compared with experimental data from a number of experiments involving continuous and pulsed incident powers. The second topic of this section involves an investigation of the breakdown properties of high-power microwave pulses propagating in air. A simple analytical modeling of the breakdown-induced pulse erosion phenomenon is made by use of empirical approximations for the ionization frequency of the microwave. The theoretical predictions are compared and found to be in good agreement with experimental results...|$|R
