The tour {{led up to the}} 2008 United States presidential election, and the book tour was suggestive of a third party candidate campaign for Jesus. The authors' speeches did not attempt to sway <b>their</b> <b>audiences</b> towards or away from any particular candidates, but rather encouraged them to endorse whichever candidates supported Christian values.|$|E
5|$|The band eschewed {{elaborate}} stage lighting during live sets, {{preferring to}} play under 40-watt household light bulbs; the technical difficulties of filming under such lighting conditions partly explains {{why there is}} little live footage of Crass. They pioneered multimedia presentation, using video technology (back-projected films and video collages by Mick Duffield and Gee Vaucher) to enhance their performances, and also distributed leaflets and handouts explaining anarchist ideas to <b>their</b> <b>audiences.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{business}} model of commercial media organizations (i.e., any that accept advertising) is selling behavior change in <b>their</b> <b>audience</b> to advertisers. However, few in <b>their</b> <b>audience</b> {{are aware of}} the conflict of interest between the profit motive and the altruistic desire to serve the public and [...] "give the audience what it wants".|$|R
5|$|In works where elves are {{the main}} characters, such as The Silmarillion or Wendy and Richard Pini’s comic book series Elfquest, elves exhibit a similar range of {{behaviour}} to a human cast, distinguished largely by their superhuman physical powers. However, where narratives are more human-centered, as in The Lord of the Rings, elves tend to sustain their role as powerful, sometimes threatening, outsiders. Despite the obvious fictionality of fantasy novels and games, scholars have found that elves in these works {{continue to have a}} subtle role in shaping the real-life identities of <b>their</b> <b>audiences.</b> For example, elves can function to encode real-world racial others in video games, or to influence gender-norms through literature.|$|E
5|$|Parades {{are held}} {{for a range}} of purposes, often more than one. Whether their mood is sombre or festive, being public events that are {{designed}} to attract attention and activities that necessarily divert normal traffic, parades have a clear entertainment value to <b>their</b> <b>audiences.</b> Cavalcades and the modern variant, the motorcade, are examples of public processions. Some people watching the parade or procession may have made a special effort to attend, while others become part of the audience by happenstance. Whatever their mood or primary purpose, parades attract and entertain people who watch them pass by. Occasionally, a parade takes place in an improvised theatre space (such as the Trooping the Colour in 5) and tickets are sold to the physical audience while the global audience participates via broadcast.|$|E
5|$|Riley and Nye made {{arrangements}} with James Pond {{to make two}} national tours during 1888 and 1889. The tours were popular and generally sold out, with hundreds having to be turned away. The shows were usually forty-five {{minutes to an hour}} long and featured Riley reading often humorous poetry interspersed by stories and jokes from Nye. The shows were informal and the two men adjusted their performances based on <b>their</b> <b>audiences</b> reactions. Riley memorized forty of his poems for the shows to add to his own versatility. Many prominent literary and theatrical people attended the shows. At a New York City show in March 1888, Augustin Daly was so enthralled by the show he insisted on hosting the two men at a banquet with several leading Broadway theatre actors.|$|E
50|$|Audience {{design is}} a sociolinguistic model {{outlined}} by Allan Bell in 1984 which proposes that linguistic style-shifting occurs primarily {{in response to}} a speaker's audience. According to this model, speakers adjust their speech primarily towards that of <b>their</b> <b>audience</b> in order to express solidarity or intimacy with them, or away from <b>their</b> <b>audience’s</b> speech to express distance.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{combines}} {{survey and}} large-scale log data {{to examine how}} well users’ perceptions of <b>their</b> <b>audience</b> match <b>their</b> actual <b>audience</b> on Facebook. AbstractWhen you share content in an online social network, who is listening? Users have scarce information about who actually sees their content, making <b>their</b> <b>audience</b> seem invisible and difficult to estimate. However, understanding this invisible audience can impact both science and design, since perceived audiences influence content production and self-presentation online. In this paper, we combine survey and large-scale log data to examine how well users’ perceptions of <b>their</b> <b>audience</b> match <b>their</b> actual <b>audience</b> on Facebook. We find that social media users consistently underestimate <b>their</b> <b>audience</b> size for <b>their</b> posts, guessing that <b>their</b> <b>audience</b> is just 27 % of its true size. Qualitative coding of survey responses reveals folk theories that attempt to reverse-engineer audience size using feedback and friend count, though none of these approaches are particularly accurate. We analyze audience logs for 222, 000 Facebook users’ posts {{over the course of}} one month and find that publicly visible signals — friend count, likes, and comments — vary widely and do not strongly indicate the audience of a single post. Despite the variation, users typically reach 61 % of their friends each month. Together, our results begin to reveal the invisible undercurrents of audience attention and behavior in online social networks. Authored by Michael S. Bernstein, Eytan Bakshy, Moira Burke and Brian Karrer...|$|R

5|$|The Mozart family grand {{tour was}} {{a journey through}} western Europe, {{undertaken}} by Leopold Mozart, his wife Anna Maria, and their musically gifted children Maria Anna (Nannerl) and Wolfgang Amadeus from 1763 to 1766. At {{the start of the}} tour the children were aged eleven and seven respectively. Their extraordinary skills had been demonstrated during a visit to Vienna in 1762, when they had played before the Empress Maria Theresa at the Imperial Court. Sensing the social and pecuniary opportunities that might accrue from a prolonged trip embracing the capitals and main cultural centres of Europe, Leopold obtained an extended leave of absence from his post as deputy Kapellmeister to the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg. Throughout the subsequent tour, the children's Wunderkind status was confirmed as their precocious performances consistently amazed and gratified <b>their</b> <b>audiences.</b>|$|E
5|$|The new Meiji Government had {{banned the}} {{carrying}} of swords and in 1876 banned {{the practice of}} duelling, and so traditional swordsmanship was no longer popular. Sakakibara tried {{to find new ways}} of promoting kenjutsu. His motives may have been financial, as without a sponsor he, like many other martial artists of the era, was suffering from penury– his poverty was such that he had to accept help from his wife's uncle Katsu Kaishū in constructing a residence. He began organising , feeling that such public competitions would instil an appreciation for the art of the swordsman in <b>their</b> <b>audiences.</b> He started an organisation called the , which, inspired by the popularity of sumo wrestling, organised these contests. The first public kogyo organised by Sakakibara's group took place in April 1873, and lasted for over a week. Other martial artists, witnessing the success of the Gekken Kaisha, followed suit.|$|E
25|$|Technically, radio, television, cinemas, VCDs and DVDs, music systems, games, {{computer}} hardware and mobile telephony publish information to <b>their</b> <b>audiences.</b> Indeed, {{the marketing of}} a major film often includes a novelization, a graphic novel or comic version, the soundtrack album, a game, model, toys and endless promotional publications.|$|E

25|$|Mesmer did not {{contribute}} religious beliefs, but he brought a technique, later known as hypnotism, that it was claimed could induce trances and cause subjects to report contact with supernatural beings.

In addition to actively promoting Raga, Harrison produced the soundtrack album – a project that led directly to he and Shankar staging the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971.|$|E

This is fairly common among many types of museums, however, and visitors will find adult-oriented content alongside that intended for children.|$|R
25|$|Inspired heavily by the {{concurrent}} works of Sly Stone, the lyrics for these songs centered primarily around then-current social {{issues such as}} integration, the Vietnam War, and self-consciousness. In addition, {{in an attempt to}} get the social message contained therein across to <b>their</b> <b>audiences</b> more clearly, many of the psychedelic soul recordings of this period were presented in mixes of extended length, often up to twice, triple or quadruple the length of the typical three-minute Motown song.|$|E
25|$|Performances {{given by}} a hoop busker will usually combine hooping with other {{disciplines}} including acrobatics, contortion, juggling, singing, and playing one or more musical instruments. The hoop busker will often include stories and humor to further entertain <b>their</b> <b>audiences.</b> Hoop buskers work for their audience's gratuities and applause. There may also be CDs and DVDs available for purchase. Hoop buskers {{can be found in}} public markets, right of ways, transit centers, and with permission on private property. There are many busker festivals around the world that feature one or more hoop buskers including the World Buskers Festival held annually in Christchurch, New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|The band's {{characteristic}} costumes {{are generally}} made of foam latex, styrofoam, and hardened rubber. The costumes cover {{very little of}} the band members' bodies; the bare parts are accentuated with makeup. They further their production in concert by spraying <b>their</b> <b>audiences</b> with fluids. Most of the fluids are made of water and powdered food coloring which, for the most part, flakes off or washes out easily. The thicker fluids are made from a clear seaweed extract called carrageenan, which is also used in ice cream and milkshakes. Gwar does not use syrups or stage blood because they dry solid and can damage the band's costumes.|$|E

25|$|State-based symphony orchestras, {{originally}} managed {{under the}} Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) but now operating as separate independent bodies, {{have played a}} major role in performing mainstream orchestral repertoire for the general public as well as commissioning new works from Australian composers and ensuring that works by contemporary international composers are introduced to <b>their</b> <b>audiences.</b> These include the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, the Queensland Symphony Orchestra, the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra, the West Australian Symphony Orchestra and the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra. There are also professional orchestras whose role is related specifically to opera and ballet performance, chiefly the Australian Opera and Ballet Orchestra based at the Sydney Opera House and Orchestra Victoria based in Melbourne.|$|E
25|$|For this tour, {{the band}} decided to mainly {{perform at the}} smaller clubs that they had {{originally}} played earlier in their career, rather than large arenas and auditoriums. This {{decision was made to}} reward those fans who had been loyal to them from the start of their career. The small, more intimate size of the venues, and the correspondingly smaller ticket sales and gate receipts, was offered as proof that Led Zeppelin wasn't preoccupied with making money and instead endeavoured to create a close connection with <b>their</b> <b>audiences</b> when performing on-stage. However, as the tour progressed, it became evident that this intention was compromised due to thousands of fans being shut out of shows because of the scarce availability of concert tickets.|$|E
25|$|While {{these early}} efforts in orchestrated merengue {{generally}} succeeded only in scandalizing <b>their</b> <b>audiences,</b> the political changes {{that occurred in}} the Dominican Republic {{over the next few years}} made a resurgence of the merengue possible. The resented North American invasion of 1916 seems to have made the general public more disposed to support autochthonous rhythms over imported ones, though the raucous rural accordion sound was still unacceptable to high-society tastes. Nevertheless, when Rafael Leonidas Trujillo took power in 1930, he imposed the merengue upon all levels of society, some say as a form of punishment for the elites that had previously refused to accept him. The soon-to-be dictator must also have realized the symbolic power of the rural folk music and its potential for creating support among the masses, since he took accordionists with him around the Republic during his campaign tours from the very beginning.|$|E
