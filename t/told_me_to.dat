It's a sad story, but it's one I think everyone needs to hear.|$|E

Eichmann asked Grüber in a meeting about Jewish emigration why Grüber, not having any Jewish family and with no prospect for any thank, does help the Jews. Grüber answered because the Good Samaritan did so, and my Lord <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do so.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in 2003, Mennonites held a {{reconciliation}} meeting with Native Americans, resulting in subsequent meetings asking for forgiveness. The Amish, as pacifists, did {{not engage in}} warfare with Native Americans, nor displaced them directly, but {{were part of a}} wave of European immigrants who forced Native Americans westward. “The Lord <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> honor the Native Americans because they’re the gatekeepers of the land,” stated Melvin Lapp, who was raised in an Amish family and helped in a gathering between Amish of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania and twelve Native American tribes.|$|E

25|$|Head first {{showed his}} talent for {{teaching}} {{at the age of}} 21 when he addressed the Stoke Newington Mutual Instruction Society at the Friends Meeting House, Park Street, on the fertilization of plants. Professor H. M. Turnbull writes of Head's devotion to teaching:I had the good fortune when first going to the hospital to meet daily in the mornings on the steam engine underground railway Dr. Henry Head. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> buy Gee's little book on percussion, and kindly taught me throughout our journeys about physical signs, much to the annoyance of our fellow travellers; indeed in his characteristic keenness he spoke so loudly that as we walked to the hospital from St. Mary's station {{people on the other side}} of the wide Whitechapel Road would turn to look at us. I was greatly interested in the central nervous system when learning physiology and anatomy, and so I enjoyed greatly my three months as a clerk to him, his sessions in the out-patient department, and his wonderful demonstrations on clinical evenings.... He devoted a great deal of time to teaching. In his rounds of the wards his clerks read the histories and examinations they had written, and he criticized even the English. He did not confine himself to nervous diseases, but took more pains than any other physician for whom I clerked to teach us physical signs and – how to examine patients of all kinds. He was a little too anxious to get exactly correct results when demonstrating to students; thus when he was mapping out areas of anaesthesia or hyperaesthesia the cottonwool, pin, etc., would pass more slowly, and the 'say when' would become a little more rapid and insistent, as the correct boundary was approached.|$|E

He commented on the situation, saying [...] "You have to put things in perspective. It was stress, something that had never affected me, but this time, yes, it did. So I had to pay.
