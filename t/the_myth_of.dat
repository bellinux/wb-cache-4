5|$|<b>The</b> <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> Myrrha {{has been}} chronicled {{in several other}} works than Ovid's Metamorphoses. Among the {{scholars}} who recounted it are Apollodorus, Hyginus, and Antoninus Liberalis. All three versions differ.|$|E

5|$|The {{translation}} of <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> Myrrha {{as it appeared}} in Ovid's Metamorphoses is suggested as being {{a critique of the}} political settlement that followed the Glorious Revolution. The wife of the leader of this revolution, William of Orange, was Mary, daughter of James II. Mary and William were crowned king and queen of England in 1689, and because Dryden was deeply sympathetic to James he lost his public offices and fell into political disfavor under the new reign. Dryden turned to translation and infused these translations with political satire in response - <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> Myrrha being one of these translations.|$|E

5|$|An {{incidental}} {{appearance of}} Auriga in Greek mythology is as the limbs of Medea's brother.

5|$|By the mid-1950s, HIAG {{established}} {{an image that}} separated the Waffen-SS from other SS formations and shifted responsibility for crimes {{that could not be}} denied to the Allgemeine-SS (security and police), the SS-Totenkopfverbände and the Einsatzgruppen. The Waffen-SS was thus successfully integrated into <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> the clean Wehrmacht.|$|E
5|$|Calafia, {{also called}} Califia, has been {{depicted}} as the Spirit of California, {{and has been}} the subject of modern-day sculpture, paintings, stories and films; she often figures in <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> California's origin, symbolizing an untamed and bountiful land prior to Europeans taking the land by force.|$|E

5|$|Martial also {{suggests}} {{the rape of}} a woman by a bull in a re-creation of <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> Pasiphaë.

5|$|Animal Sacrifice of {{a buffalo}} or goat, {{particularly}} during smallpox epidemics, has been practiced {{in parts of}} South India. The sacrificed animal is dedicated to a goddess, and is probably related to <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> goddess Kali in Andhra Pradesh, but in Karnataka, the typical goddess is Renuka. According to Alf Hiltebeitel – a professor of Religions, History and Human Sciences, these ritual animal sacrifices, with some differences, mirrors goddess-related ritual animal sacrifice found in Gilgamesh epic and in texts of Egyptian, Minoan and Greek sources.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} decade of the century, the {{political}} climate in Europe was feverish: the War of the League of Cambrai had begun. The French, under Gaston of Foix, Duke of Nemours, had sacked Brescia in 1512, the town now in ruins and <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> Brixia magnipotens shattered. A lively era of humanism and trade was ended, a phenomenon that would affect the rest of the peninsula in the following decades.|$|E

5|$|Both {{civilian}} and military authorities considered the Wehrmachtbericht to be a vital instrument of German home-front mobilisation, the civilian contribution to the German war effort, especially after the defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad. According to historians Wolfram Wette and Daniel Uziel, the final 9 May 1945 communiqué {{laid the foundation for}} <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> the clean Wehrmacht, the notion that the Wehrmacht had fought honourably and was not implicated in the crimes of the Nazi regime, for which (according to the myth) only the SS bore responsibility.|$|E
5|$|Corona Australis {{has been}} {{associated}} with <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> Bacchus and Stimula. Jupiter had impregnated Stimula, causing Juno to become jealous. Juno convinced Stimula to ask Jupiter to appear in his full splendor, which the mortal woman could not handle, causing her to burn. After Bacchus, Stimula's unborn child, became an adult and the god of wine, he honored his deceased mother by placing a wreath in the sky.|$|E
5|$|In {{between the}} Argo and the Trojan War, {{there was a}} {{generation}} known chiefly for its horrific crimes. This includes the doings of Atreus and Thyestes at Argos. Behind <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> the house of Atreus (one of the two principal heroic dynasties with the house of Labdacus) lies {{the problem of the}} devolution of power and of the mode of accession to sovereignty. The twins Atreus and Thyestes with their descendants played the leading role in the tragedy of the devolution of power in Mycenae.|$|E
