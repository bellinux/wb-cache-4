5|$|It was prophesied to {{the patriarch}} Abraham {{that he would}} have a son and that his name should be Isaac. When Abraham became one hundred years old, this son was born to him by his first wife Sarah. <b>Though</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> Abraham's second son it was Sarah's first and only child.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} passing of noble titles or ranks, {{inheritance}} practices did not involve primogeniture; each son received an equal share of the family property. Unlike the practice in later dynasties, the father usually sent his adult married sons away with their portions of the family fortune. Daughters received {{a portion of the}} family fortune through their marriage dowries, <b>though</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> usually much less than the shares of sons. A different distribution of the remainder could be specified in a will, but it is unclear how common this was.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Gerald Ford {{moves into}} the house across the street after Bush leaves. When {{originally}} conceived, Richard Nixon was going to move in instead, <b>though</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> changed to Bob Dole following Nixon's death. The writers then decided it would be funnier if it were Ford since they believed he was the politician who best represented Homer. Keeler's first draft also included a musical number in the style of Tom Lehrer's satirical recordings, although this ended up being cut.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham fans {{consider}} their main rivals to be Aston Villa, their nearest neighbours geographically, {{with whom they}} contest the Second City derby. Lesser rivalries exist with fellow West Midlands clubs Wolverhampton Wanderers and West Bromwich Albion. According to a 2003 Football Fans Census survey, Aston Villa fans thought of Birmingham City as their main rivals, <b>though</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> not always the case.|$|E
5|$|In 1834, King Ludwig I {{granted the}} city its old {{coat of arms}} again {{in the form of}} large and small crests. These {{embodied}} the small crest seal of 1304 and the large one of 1323. The 1835 coat of arms had a blue background, <b>though</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> later corrected to argent under Ludwig II in 1865. The background was rarely changed. One example of its occurrence, however, was when or was used in the 16th century instead.|$|E

5|$|In {{international}} affairs {{the most dramatic}} event during Douglas-Home's premiership was the assassination of President Kennedy in November 1963. Douglas-Home, clearly moved, broadcast a tribute on television. He had liked and worked well with Kennedy, and did not develop such a satisfactory relationship with Lyndon Johnson. Their governments had a serious disagreement {{on the question of}} British trade with Cuba. Under Douglas-Home the colonies of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland gained independence, <b>though</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> as a result of negotiations led by Macleod under the Macmillan government.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of Allied victory, Truman journeyed to Europe for the Potsdam Conference. He was there {{when he learned that}} the Trinity test of the first atomic bomb on July 16 had been successful. He hinted to Joseph Stalin that the U.S. was about to use a new kind of weapon against the Japanese. <b>Though</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the first time the Soviets had been officially given {{information}} about the atomic bomb, Stalin was already aware of the bomb project, having learned about it (through espionage) long before Truman did.|$|E

He also asked {{that half of the}} money be donated to the Friends of Sunset Playground, a local organization set up {{to raise money for the}} renovation of a playground at 28th Avenue and Lawton Street. The donation was later rejected by the group's fiscal agency, Sunset Youth Services, after the directors, Dawn and Ron Stueckle and Delvin Mack learned the nature of the donation source.|$|E

5|$|Kosovo Albanian {{refugees}} took {{to using}} bunkers as temporary shelters until aid agencies could move them into tent camps, while NATO troops stationed in Albania relocated dozens of bunkers to fortify their base at Kukës. The Kosovo Liberation Army also used them as defensive positions during the Kosovo War, <b>though</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{not without its}} risks; {{on at least one}} occasion bunkers along Albania's border with Kosovo were mistakenly bombed by NATO aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Stalin's {{willingness}} to expend recently conscripted armies, which were poorly trained and poorly supplied, illustrated a misconception of realities, {{both in the}} capabilities of the Red Army and the subordinate arms of the armed forces, and in the abilities of the Germans to defend themselves and successfully launch a counteroffensive. The latter proved especially true in the subsequent Case Blue, which led to the Battle of Stalingrad, <b>though</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the battle in which Paulus faced an entirely different outcome.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 {{budget was}} {{delivered}} by Finance Minister Marshall on April 24, 2012, {{and was a}} stark contrast from the austerity budget that Dunderdale and her ministers had been warning of for months. Only 45 temporary positions were cut from the public service and a review of programs found $38.8 million in savings, {{much lower than the}} $100 million Dunderdale had previously mentioned. Government spending actually increased in the budget by 1.7 per cent, <b>though</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> below the rate of inflation.|$|E

5|$|The Kriegsmarine {{considered}} the ships {{to be good}} sea boats, with a slight roll. As built, they were wet in a head sea, <b>though</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> significantly improved by the installation of a clipper bow in 1940–1941. The ships were highly maneuverable, particularly when the maneuvering setting for the diesel engines was used, in which half of the engines for each shaft were run in reverse. The ships heeled over up to 13degrees with the rudder hard over. The low stern was wet in a stern sea, and equipment stored there was frequently lost overboard.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{opened in}} 1867, and {{originally}} included a drawbridge section at its north end for tall ships to pass, <b>though</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> later {{replaced by the}} current swing bridge section. In 1980, woodworm threatened {{the safety of the}} bridge, which needed major repairs to avoid closure. Tolls were collected for foot and cycle traffic until 2013. The bridge is a Grade II* listed structure, and has one of the longest timber viaducts still in regular use in Britain.|$|E

Morris determined during the creation of the territory that the affairs of the District of Keewatin should be administered from Fort Garry until November 7, 1876. A total of six members were appointed to the Council. The law that created the territory allowed for a minimum of five members.|$|E

A {{minority}} {{wanted it to be}} apportioned so that all states would have equal weight, <b>though</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> never seriously considered. Most wanted it apportioned in accordance with some mixture of property and population. Though there was discussion on how to calculate property for this purpose, the issue of property was later dropped because of its difficulty, and an assumption that property would closely correlate to population.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} the fiction is thought by Donald Tuck to have {{generally}} fallen during Santesson's period at the helm, <b>though</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> not entirely his faultthere were a great many other magazines competing for stories by the top writers. Santesson himself, despite a modicum of controversy over his heavy use of UFO and related material, was kind and helpful to writers, and was well liked as a result.|$|E

The Roon-class ships carried 380 shells for the main battery, 1,600 rounds for the 15cm guns, and 2,100 shells for the 8.8cm guns. The planned conversion for Roon to a seaplane carrier called for six 15cm L/45 guns and six 8.8cm Flak guns, with 2,400 rounds, <b>though</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> never carried out.|$|E
