Fetal hemoglobin enhances the fetus' ability to draw oxygen from the placenta. Its oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve is shifted to the left, meaning that it is able to absorb oxygen at lower concentrations than adult hemoglobin. This enables fetal hemoglobin to absorb oxygen from adult hemoglobin in the placenta, where the oxygen pressure is lower than at the lungs. Until around six months' old, the human infant's hemoglobin molecule is made up of two alpha and two gamma chains (2α2γ). The gamma chains are gradually replaced by beta chains until the molecule becomes hemoglobin A with its two alpha and two beta chains (2α2β).|$|E

The addition of the NO scavenger, carboxy-PT 10, reduced the effect of SNAP. hboO gene expression increased under low-oxygen conditions, while hboN expression was unaffected.

Splitting of the ester and amide carbonyl stretch vibrations is observed in the Raman spectrum of crystals of valinomycin grown from both n-octane and acetone. These observations support the contention that some ester carbonyl groups are intramolecularly hydrogen bonded. The Raman spectruJn of valinomycin grown fron o-dichlorobenzene does not display this feature. Valinomycin, a cyclic depsipeptide, has been extensively studied because of its ion-selective carrier properties in biological and artificial membranes (1, 2). Elucidating the conformations of valinomycin in well-defined media is an essential preliminary to understanding the detailed mechanism of selective transport of K+ (or Rb+) across membranes of the lipid bilayer type.

Furthermore, protection against a BHV- 1 challenge was obtained in calves immunized with the plasmid encoding tgD-VP 22, as shown by significant reductions in viral excretion.

40|$|Phosphate (Pi) {{reabsorption}} in renal proximal tubules involves Na+/Pi cotransport {{across the}} brush border membrane; its transport rate {{is influenced by}} the Na(+) -coupled transport of other solutes as well as by pH. In the present study, we have expressed a cloned rat renal brush border membrane Na+/Pi cotransporter (NaPi- 2) in Xenopus laevis oocytes and have analyzed its electrophysiologic properties in voltage- and current-clamp studies. Addition of Pi to Na(+) -containing superfusates resulted in a depolarization of the membrane potential and, in voltage-clamped oocytes, in an inward current (IP). An analysis of the Na+ and/or Pi concentration dependence of IP suggested a Na+/Pi stoichiometry of 3 : 1. IP was increased by increasing the pH of the superfusate; this phenomenon seems to be mainly related to a lowering of the affinity for Na+ interaction by increasing H+ concentration. The present data suggest that known properties of Pi handling at the tubular/membrane level are "directly" related to specific characteristics of the <b>transport</b> <b>molecule</b> (NaPi- 2) involved...|$|E

Cultures which were grown without supporting cells and from which cholinergic synaptic interactions were recorded physiologically were processed for autoradiography after incubation with [3 H]NE.

40|$|Background: A large oral dose of iron {{will reduce}} the {{absorption}} of a subsequent smaller dose of iron in a phenomenon known as mucosal block. Molecular analysis of this process may provide insights into the regulation of intestinal iron absorption. Aims: To {{determine the effect of}} an oral bolus of iron on duodenal expression of molecules associated with intestinal iron transport in rats and to relate this to changes in iron absorption. Methods: Rats were given an oral dose of iron and duodenal expression of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT 1), Dcytb, Ireg 1, and hephaestin (Hp) was determined using the ribonuclease protection assay, western blotting, and immunofluorescence. Iron absorption was measured using radioactive Fe. Results: A decrease in intestinal iron absorption occurred following an oral dose of iron and this was associated with increased enterocyte iron levels, as assessed by iron regulatory protein activity and immunoblotting for ferritin. Reduced absorption was also accompanied by a rapid decrease in expression of the mRNAs encoding the brush border iron <b>transport</b> <b>molecules</b> Dcytb and the iron responsive element (IRE) containing the splice variant of DMT 1. No such change was seen in expression of the non-IRE splice variant of DMT 1 or the basolateral iron <b>transport</b> <b>molecules</b> Ireg 1 and Hp. Similar changes were observed at the protein level. Conclusions: These data indicate that brush border, but not basolateral, iron transport components are regulated locally by enterocyte iron levels and support the hypothesis that systemic stimuli exert their primary effect on basolateral <b>transport</b> <b>molecules...</b>|$|R

Important pathophysiological mechanisms include disturbed metabolism and homeostasis of major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, glutamate and GABA. Current drug treatments are largely aimed at decreasing neuronal excitability and thereby preventing the occurrence of seizures. However, many patients are refractory to treatment and side effects are frequent. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) {{is the most common}} type of drug-resistant epilepsy in adults. In rodents, the pilocarpine-status epilepticus model reflects the pathology and chronic spontaneous seizures of TLE and the pentylenetetrazole kindling model exhibits chronic induced limbic seizures.
