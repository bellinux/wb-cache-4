5|$|In interviews, Garcia, Dae Kim, and Holloway {{commented that}} <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> fun {{shooting}} their scenes, {{as they had}} not worked together for a while. The episode marked the first appearance of recurring guest actor Cheech Marin. It first aired on February 28, 2007, in the United States on ABC, with an estimated 12.78 million viewers. The episode received mixed reviews, with many praising its humor but still noting that little was learned concerning the show's overall mythology.|$|E
25|$|The Buckeyes took {{advantage}} and finished their {{season with a}} close win against Michigan, who were ranked 9th nationally. They held on to a 14-9 lead with an interception in the endzone by safety Will Allen in the final seconds. Even though they were undefeated, the Buckeyes were heading into the Fiesta Bowl as 2 touchdown underdogs. But <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> motivation from strong leaders like 3x All-American safety Mike Doss.|$|E
500|$|Conan {{received}} fair-to-good {{ratings from}} critics. In 2008, review aggregator sites Metacritic and GameRankings selected around 80 reviews and calculated average scores of 69 (out of 100) and 70% for the game, respectively. [...] Most critics {{agreed that the}} game's best selling point was its variety in combat. [...] <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> fun with its easy-to-learn controls, skill customization, and most of all, the varied brutal depictions of Conan's kills. [...] TeamXbox said that the combat system [...] "blossoms into a complex string of commands that will reward the user (with gore) for pressing the right buttons at the right time". The pounding, militaristic orchestra tunes accompanying the action further enhanced the critics' experience with the game.|$|E

500|$|In a 2001 {{interview}} with Howard Stern, Rollins {{was asked about}} rumors that he had Joe Cole's brain in his house. Rollins stated that he only has the soil from the spot Cole was killed. During the interview, Rollins also speculated that the reason they were targeted may have been because days prior to the incident, record producer Rick Rubin – who was {{a fan of the}} Rollins Band – had requested to hear the then newly recorded album, The End of Silence, and parked his Rolls-Royce outside their Venice Beach house while carrying a cell phone. Because of the notoriety of the neighborhood, Rollins suspected that this would bring trouble because of the implication that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> money in the home. He even wrote in his journal the night of Rubin's visit: [...] "My place is going to get popped." ...|$|E
2500|$|During 2001, after a low key tour {{supporting}} Texas, {{they took}} a long summer break, in North Devon, to write new material for their fifth album. The self-financed sessions were deliberately performed at arms length from their record label and the music industry in general, and Reef enjoyed the opportunity {{to return to their}} earlier, more basic approach to making music. In an interview to the BBC Jack said [...] "It's a harder sound, like when we first came out - a deep sound, heavy, I really like that." [...] Whilst <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> new material, Sony forced Reef to only use around a third of this material as part of a greatest hits offering entitled Together - The Best of Reef released in January 2003. Jack Bessant denounced the complete lack of support from Sony and Kenwyn House called the release [...] "a kiss of death." [...] Many fans felt the new material had been some of their best work for some time.|$|E

60|$|The {{next morning}} all the Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother West Wind were turned {{out of the}} big bag into the Green Meadows very early indeed, for <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> errands to do. All over the Green Meadows they hurried, all through the wood, {{up and down the}} Laughing Brook and all around the Smiling Pool, {{inviting}} everybody to meet at the Great Pine on the hill at nine o'clock to form a committee of the whole--to try to find the thief who stole Happy Jack's nuts from the hollow in the old chestnut tree.|$|E

The fireworks started to go off--why I don't know--and they {{set fire to the}} cloth, and when we wet that down it made an awful smoke. But all the stuff was in a zinc-lined compartment, so there wasn't much real danger. The worst was when those rockets went off and shot up right out of the hatchway." ...|$|E

The priest at Er-Heb was doing all right, but <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> pending cases about land to show me, and some men from another village had been firing arrows at night. I went out and looked for that village and fired four rounds at it from a {{thousand}} yards. That used all the cartridges I cared to spend, and I waited for Dravot, who had been away two or three months, and I kept my people quiet.|$|E

6000|$|A lot of {{accounts}} have been settled here tonight for me; I have held grudges {{against some of}} these people, but they have all been wiped out by the very handsome compliments that have been paid me. Even Wayne MacVeagh--I have had a grudge against him many years. The first time I saw Wayne MacVeagh was at a private dinner-party at Charles A. Dana's, and when I got there he was clattering along, and I {{tried to get a}} word in here and there; but you know what Wayne MacVeagh is when he is started, and I could not get in five words to his one--or one word to his five. I struggled along and struggled along, and--well, I wanted to tell and I was trying to tell a dream I had had the night before, and it was a remarkable dream, a dream worth people's while to listen to, a dream recounting Sam Jones the revivalist's reception in heaven. I was on a train, and was approaching the celestial way-station--I had a through ticket--and I noticed a man sitting alongside of me asleep, and he had his ticket in his hat. He was the remains of the Archbishop of Canterbury; I recognized him by his photograph. I had nothing against him, so I took his ticket and let him have mine. He didn't object--he wasn't in a condition to object--and presently when the train stopped at the heavenly station--well, I got off, and he went on by request--but there they all were, the angels, you know, millions of them, every one with a torch; they had arranged for a torch-light procession; they were expecting the Archbishop, and when I got off they started to raise a shout, but it didn't materialize. I don't know whether they were disappointed. I suppose <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> superstitious ideas about the Archbishop and what he should look like, and I didn't fill the bill, and I was trying to explain to Saint Peter, and was doing it in the German tongue, because I didn't want to be too explicit. Well, I found it was no use, I couldn't get along, for Wayne MacVeagh was occupying the whole place, and I said to Mr. Dana, [...] "What is the matter with that man? Who is that man with the long tongue? What's the trouble with him, that long, lank cadaver, old oil-derrick out of a job--who is that?" [...] "Well, now," [...] Mr. Dana said, [...] "you don't want to meddle with him; you had better keep quiet; just keep quiet, because that's a bad man. Talk! He was born to talk. Don't let him get out with you; he'll skin you." [...] I said, [...] "I have been skinned, skinned, and skinned for years, there is nothing left." [...] He said, [...] "Oh, you'll find there is; that man is the very seed and inspiration of that proverb which says, 'No matter how close you skin an onion, a clever man can always peel it again.'" [...] Well, I reflected and I quieted down. That would never occur to Tom Reed. He's got no discretion. Well, MacVeagh is just the same man; he hasn't changed a bit in all those years; he has been peeling Mr. Mitchell lately. That's the kind of man he is.|$|E
