Andesites appear as lava flows while dacites form lava domes and dome complexes. The rocks from the main Aucanquilcha volcano are uniformly dacitic and show little evidence of <b>temporal</b> <b>variation</b> in their composition. Potassium content ranges from 1.5 to 4%. Plagioclase is the dominant component of the magma. Clinopyroxene+orthopyroxene+amphibole (hornblende and pargasite) or amphibole+biotite+minor amounts of pyroxene are subordinate components. Apatite, ilmenite, magnetite and zircon can also be found. There is evidence of magma mixing and mingling.|$|E

For example, a study by Manlik et al. (2016) forecast the viability of two bottlenose dolphin populations in Western Australia and identified reproduction as having the greatest influence on the forecast of these populations. One of the two populations was forecast to be stable, whereas the other population was forecast to decline, if it isolated from other populations and low reproductive rates persist. The difference in viability between the two studies was primarily due to differences in reproduction and not survival. The study also showed that <b>temporal</b> <b>variation</b> in reproduction had a greater effect on population growth than <b>temporal</b> <b>variation</b> in survival.|$|E

It has therefore been theorized that the same ecological processes that drive phylogenetic diversity geographically, also shape communities at the temporal level within a given community.|$|E

40|$|When {{applying}} the Earth's natural pulse electromagnetic fields to geophysical prospecting one should {{take into account}} characteristics of their spatial and <b>temporal</b> <b>variations.</b> ENPEMF is known to include both pulses attributed to atmospheric thunderstorms and pulses generated in the lithosphere by mechanic-to-electric energy conversion in rocks. It is evident that the most valuable information on the geophysical structure of a certain area is obviously contained in pulses originated from this area. This article covers a method of recording spatial variations of the Earth's natural pulse electromagnetic fields which is able to take due account of spatial and <b>temporal</b> <b>variations</b> of EM fields and suits to reveal crustal structural and lithologic heterogeneities including hydrocarbon pools. We use a system of several stations recording the ENPEMF concurrently to erase the <b>temporal</b> <b>variations</b> from ENPEMF records and {{to sort out the}} pulses of local and remote origin. Some stations are fixed (reference) and record only <b>temporal</b> <b>variations</b> of EM fields. While the other stations are mobile and measure pulse characteristics related to both spatial and <b>temporal</b> ENPEMF <b>variations</b> along measurement routes crossing the area investigated. Spatial variations of EM fields left after having deleted the <b>temporal</b> <b>variations</b> and pulses generated out of the area investigate show the availability or the lack of geophysical anomalies...|$|R

Acoustic signals are produced by many groups including several orthopeteran species, neuropterida, cicadas, flies, cave planthroppers, leaf hoppers, and tree hoppers. In crickets and other Orthopeterans, loudness and/or uninterrupted songs often attract more females. In other insects, females may choose a mate in relation to aspects of his songs. In any case, it is possible that females compare the songs of several males before making a choice.|$|E

In this study, we evaluate the <b>temporal</b> <b>variations</b> in soil moisture based on the microwave polarization difference index (MPDI) using ground-based measurements in China. In situ soil moisture at six test sites during the crop-growing season from 2009 to 2011 is obtained.

The results show that the accuracies of the consistency vary from approximately 40 % to 90 %. Compared with the in situ soil moisture at 0 - 10 cm, the <b>temporal</b> <b>variations</b> in soil moisture are best characterized by the 6. 9 GHz MPDI values from the ascending overpasses (MPDI_ 06 A).

30|$|Seismic {{interferometry}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} effective techniques for detecting <b>temporal</b> <b>variations</b> in seismic velocity caused by large earthquakes. Before the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake (Mw 9.0) near the Japan Trench, a slow slip event (SSE, Mw 7.0) and low-frequency tremors were observed near the trench. Here, we applied a seismic interferometry technique using ambient noise to data from 17 ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs) installed above the focal region before the main shock. We used our technique to detect <b>temporal</b> <b>variations</b> in seismic velocity caused by the main shock, SSE, and low-frequency tremors. In the region above the large coseismic slip area, we detected a 1 – 2 % seismic velocity decrease after the main shock. In addition, we observed very small temporal increases in seismic velocity near the SSE fault during the initial SSE stage. Moreover, for most of the OBSs, we observed <b>temporal</b> <b>variations</b> in the autocorrelation functions (ACFs) during the low-frequency tremors. These may have been caused by <b>temporal</b> <b>variations</b> in the ambient noise source distributions, resulting from low-frequency tremors.
