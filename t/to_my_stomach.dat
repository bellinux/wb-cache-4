[...] Speaking to Wolf Blitzer on CNN two years later, he said: [...] "Every time I hear the word 'conservative,' it makes me sick <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> because they're really just fake Christians, as I call them. That's all they are. ... I think they want to be judge and jury. Like, I'm for gay marriage. It's none of my business if gay people want to get married. I'm pro-choice. And I think these Christians, first of all, they're not supposed to judge other people. But they're the most hypocritical judge of people we have in the country. And it bugs the hell out of me. They act like they're Christians. They're not forgiving at all."

60|$|The idea {{of having}} killed a man with such an {{instrument}} as half {{a pair of scissors}} seemed <b>to</b> turn <b>my</b> <b>stomach.</b> I am sure I might have killed a dozen with a firelock, a sabre, a bayonet, or any accepted weapon, and been visited by no such sickness of remorse. And to this feeling every unusual circumstance of our rencounter, the darkness in which we had fought, our nakedness, even the resin on the twine, appeared to contribute. I ran <b>to</b> <b>my</b> fallen adversary, kneeled by him, and could only sob his name.|$|R
60|$|Thus were {{my hopes}} again revived that I should finally meet with an {{opportunity}} to quit the desolate island. Beyond doubt these seas were frequented by whalemen, and, so long as I kept up a stout heart, sooner or later I should be saved. For seven years I had lived on seal meat, so that at sight of the enormous plentitude of different and succulent food I fell a victim to my weakness and ate of such quantities that once again I was well nigh to dying. And yet, after all, this, and the affair of the small fish, were mere indispositions due to the foreignness of the food <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> which had learned to prosper on seal meat and on nothing but seal meat.|$|E
60|$|Then I took in hand an {{important}} subdivision of the proceedings. I {{went up to}} Atlanta on the train and laid in a two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar supply of the most gratifying and efficient lines of grub that money could buy. I always was an admirer of viands in their more palliative and revised stages. Hog and hominy are not only inartistic <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> but they give indigestion to my moral sentiments. And I thought of Colonel Jackson T. Rockingham, president of the Sunrise & Edenville Tap Railroad, and how he would miss the luxury of his home fare as is so famous among wealthy Southerners. So I sunk half of mine and Caligula's capital in as elegant a layout of fresh and canned provisions as Burdick Harris or any other professional kidnappee ever saw in a camp.|$|E
6000|$|I do {{not know}} how long it was before I {{scrambled}} on to the tree to which I was left clinging, but it was longer than I cared about. My thoughts were of a grave and almost sombre character, but I still clung to my paddle. The stream ran away with my heels as fast as I could pull up my shoulders, and I seemed, by the weight, to have all the water of the Oise in my trousers-pockets. You can never know, till you try it, what a dead pull a river makes against a man. Death himself had me by the heels, for this was his last ambuscado, and he must now join personally in the fray. And still I held to my paddle. At last I dragged myself on <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> on the trunk, and lay there a breathless sop, with a mingled sense of humour and injustice. A poor figure I must have presented to Burns upon the hill-top with his team. But there was the paddle in my hand.

40|$|Although {{metabolism}} slows {{in winter}} months, northern pike Esox lucius will feed opportunistically on the largest available prey.

Anglers had already harvested pike and were not influenced prior <b>to</b> <b>my</b> approach. <b>Stomachs</b> were collected {{during the winter months}} of 2010 - 2011. Dissection of stomachs indicated if pike had completely digested the previous prey item(s) before feeding again.
