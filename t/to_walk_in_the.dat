5|$|Despite its {{unfinished}} state, Catherine often {{visited the}} palace. She held banquets and festivities there and loved <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gardens. According to the French military leader Marshal Tavannes, {{it was in}} the Tuileries gardens that she planned the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, in which thousands of Huguenots were butchered in Paris. The gardens had been laid out before work on the palace halted. They included canals, fountains, and a grotto decorated with glazed animals by the potter Bernard Palissy. In 1573, Catherine hosted the famous entertainment at the Tuileries that is depicted on the Valois tapestries. This was a grand ball for the Polish envoys who had come to offer the crown of Poland to her son, the duke of Anjou, later Henry III of France. Henry IV later added to the Tuileries; but Louis XVI was to dismantle sections of the palace. The communards set fire to the remainder in 1871. Twelve years later, the ruins were demolished and then sold off.|$|E

They plundered and burned homes, killing and ritually scalping many of the remaining American captives, and taking others as slaves.

25|$|The Charismatic {{element of}} the Church is seen as being evident {{today as it was}} in the early days of Christianity. Some Catholic Charismatic {{communities}} conduct healing services, gospel power services, outreaches and evangelizations where the presence of the Holy Spirit is believed to be felt, and healings and miracles are said to take place. The mission of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal is to educate believers into the totality of the declaration of the gospels. This is done by a personal relationship with Jesus Christ; a one-to-one relationship with Jesus is seen as a possibility by the Charismatic. He is encouraged to talk to Jesus directly and search for what The Lord is saying so that his life will be one with Him; <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Fruit of the Spirit in , this is what the Charismatic understands by giving their life to Jesus. Conscience is seen as an alternative voice of Jesus Christ.|$|E
25|$|Route106 near Little Long Pond {{was closed}} in March 2008 {{due to the}} failure of a culvert between Little Long Pond and Lake Kanawauke.

The construction report said the probable finish date for the project is December1, 2009. The construction was, in fact, completed in December 2009 which also included the reconstruction of a second culvert connecting the northern and southern portions of Lake Kanawauke, located approximately 1/2 mile east of the failed culvert.|$|E

25|$|Eleanor was {{the second}} of five {{children}} born to Ferdinand and Joan. Her elder brother Ferdinand was born in 1239/40, her younger brother Louis in 1242/43; two sons born after Louis died young. For the ceremonies in 1291 marking {{the first anniversary of}} Eleanor's death, 49 candlebearers were paid <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> public procession to commemorate each year of her life. Since the custom was to have one candle for each year of the deceased's life, 49 candles would date Eleanor's birth to the year 1241. Since her parents were apart from each other for 13 months while King Ferdinand was on a military campaign in Andalusia, from which he returned to the north of Spain only in February 1241, Eleanor was probably born toward the end of that year. The courts of her father and her half-brother Alfonso X of Castile were known for their literary atmosphere. Both kings also encouraged extensive education of the royal children and it is therefore likely that Eleanor was educated to a standard higher than the norm, a likelihood which is reinforced by her later literary activities as queen. She was at her father's deathbed in Seville in 1252.|$|E
25|$|The {{two teams}} were meeting after a gap {{of less than}} six months. These back to back Ashes series were being staged after 38 years, {{reminiscent}} of the 1970s. The move was initiated keeping in mind the 2015 World Cup that Australia and New Zealand were to host. The previous edition of the Ashes was played in England in July 2013 with England emerging comfortable winners. England had won the previous three editions of the Ashes and were tipped to win this edition as well. They were looking to emulate a feat {{that had not been}} achieved since the 1890s, win four Ashes on the trot. Simply going by Australia's performances in the recent past, it was assumed that the result was a foregone conclusion. Australia's batting was clearly found wanting in the previous series and they had lost matches from seemingly comfortable situations, as was seen in Durham and Lord's. The series had was also shadowed by the controversy surrounding Stuart Broad's refusal <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous series after clearly edging Ashton Agar to Michael Clarke in the first test at Trent Bridge. He was dubbed a 'smug pommie cheat' by sections of the media and with coach Darren Lehman's unsavory comments, things were even more interesting.|$|E
25|$|It {{was almost}} {{impossible}} <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> narrow streets of Paris, due to the mud and traffic, and the Champs-Élysées did not yet exist, so upper and middle class Parisians took their promenades on the grand boulevards, in {{the public and private}} parks and gardens, and above all in the Palais-Royal. The arcades of the Palais-Royal, as described by the German traveler Berkheim in 1807, contained boutiques with glass show windows displaying jewelry, fabrics, hats, perfumes, boots, dresses, paintings, porcelain, watches, toys, lingerie, and every type of luxury goods. In addition there were offices of doctors, dentists and opticians, bookstores, offices for changing money, and salons for dancing, playing billiards and cards. There were fifteen restaurants and twenty-nine cafes, plus stalls which offered fresh waffles from the oven, sweets, cider and beer. The galleries also offered gambling salons and expensive houses of prostitution. The gallery was busy from the early morning, when people came to read the newspapers and do business, and became especially crowded between five and eight in the evening. At eleven, when the shops closed and the theaters finished, a new crowd arrived, along with several hundred prostitutes, seeking clients. The gates were closed at midnight.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We use a {{reflection}} argument, introduced by Gessel and Zeilberger, {{to count the}} number of k-step walks between two points which stay within a chamber of a Weyl group. We apply this technique <b>to</b> <b>walks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> alcoves of the classical affine Weyl groups. In all cases, we get determinant formulas for the number of k-step walks. One important example is the region m> x 1 > x 2 > · · ·> xn> 0, which is a rescaled alcove of the affine Weyl group ˜ Cn. If each coordinate is considered to be an independent particle, this models n non-colliding random walks on the interval (0, m). 1...|$|R

500|$|In {{addition}} to StarClan, there exists the Dark Forest, {{also known as}} The Place of No Stars.

[...] Like StarClan cats, Dark Forest residents will fade away if they are forgotten, or killed in battle. A unique aspect is that if a living cat dies whilst visiting the Dark Forest in their dreams, they will automatically become a spirit of the Dark Forest themselves. In addition, it is possible for StarClan cats to become lost within the forest if they stay there for too long, hence why the majority avoid it.|$|E
