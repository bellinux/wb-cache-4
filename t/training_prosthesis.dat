50|$|People in {{this class}} can have {{problems}} with their gait. There {{are a number of}} different causes for these issues and suggested ways to modify them. For a gait that has abrupt heel contact, the cause can be excessive heel lever. This can be fixed by realigning their prosthetic foot. For jerky knee motions, the cause could be a loose socket in the knee or inadequate suspension. In that case, the socket might need replacing or they may need to realign the prosthesis. If they have prolonged heel contact, the cause could be problems with the heel lever in their prosthesis or a worn heel. Increasing heel stiffness or realigning the prosthesis corrects these issues. In some cases, prolonged heel contact or knees remaining fulling extended is a problem with <b>training</b> <b>prosthesis</b> use. Foot drag - often caused by an ill-fitting prosthesis - can be corrected by shortening the length of the prosthesis. Uneven length strides can be a result of problems with hip flexion or insecurity about their walk, both of which can be corrected by physical therapy.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Treatment with osseointegrated transfemoral pros-theses {{has been}} shown to improve quality of life. The {{treatment}} has been performed in Sweden since 1990 and consists of two surgical procedures followed by rehabilitation. During the first years, the rehabilitation process was not standardized. In 1999, a treatment protocol called OPRA (Osseointegrated Prostheses for the Rehabilitation of Amputees) was established. This arti-cle describes the current rehabilitation protocol and illustrates the overall results. The OPRA rehabilitation protocol is graded to stimulate the process of osseointegration and prepare the patient for unrestricted prosthetic use.

40|$|The {{concept of}} intermanual {{transfer}} {{might be used}} to start <b>prosthesis</b> <b>training</b> faster after the amputation. Intermanual transfer means that after training motor skills on one side, the other side will also improve. For <b>prosthesis</b> <b>training</b> this means that, directly after the amputation, one starts to train the unaffected arm. With this, the prosthesis skills of the affected side can improve. In this thesis the intermanual transfer effect of the prosthetic training was shown in healthy adults and children. After this, it is studied if the effect could be enlarged with adaptation in the training tasks, the inter-training intervals and by adding mirror therapy and mental imagery to the training.

The secondary {{objective of this}} review is to describe partial weight bearing exercises including static and dynamic exercises as well as use of walking aids in each rehabilitation program for screw-type and press-fit fixations. The third objective of this review is to compare key rehabilitation parameters for various partial weight bearingexercises (e. g. type of <b>training</b> <b>prosthesis,</b> loading time and progression, monitoring of loading, loading direction, instructions given to patients {{and the use of}} loading regulators) within each program for screw-type and press-fit fixations (intra-variability) and between programs for screw-type and press-fit fixations (inter-variability). The specific review questions are What are the intra-variabilities within rehabilitation programs corresponding to the differences in rehabilitation parameters within programs for each screw-type (Q 1) and press-fit (Q 2) fixations?

40|$|Medical image {{processing}} constitutes an important research {{area of the}} biomedical engineering since it provides accurate human body information for 3 D visualizat ion and analysis, diagnostic, surgical treatment planning, surgical <b>training,</b> <b>prosthesis</b> and implant design, wafer and surgical guides design. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have had a great impact in the medicine since they can represent complex three dimensional (3 D) anomalities or deformit ies. In this paper, {{the development of a}} system for tridimensional visualization and model reconstruction based on CT data is presented. The aim is to provide a system capable to assist the design process of prosthesis, implants and surgical guides by reconstructing anatomical 3 D models which can be exported to any CAD program or computer aided surgery (CAS) system. A complete description of the proposed system is presented. The new system is able to visualize and reconstruct bone and/or soft tissues. Three types of renders are used: one for 3 D visualizat ion based on three planes, other for 3 D surface reconstruction based on the well known marching cubes algorithm, and the other for 3 D volume visualizat ion based on the ray-casting algorithm. The functionality and performance of the system are evaluated by means of four case studies.

It has been getting many researchers’ attention since it could be implemented in many important applications such as neurological rehabilitation, sports <b>training,</b> <b>prosthesis</b> movement control, and so on. This research evaluates OpenBCI for Motor Imagery application, especially whether the OpenBCI Spiderclaw V 1 headwear electrodes placements are sufficient for motor imagery application. OpenBCI 32 bit board with daisy chain (16 channels) was used in this research. OpenVibe's motor imagery CSP scenarios were adopted. After subjects had finished working with the OpenVibe motor imagery scenarios, they were asked to fill Movement Imagery Questionnaire- 3 (MIQ- 3). MIQ- 3 results were used to validate whether subject suffer from “BCI illiteracy”. It could be concluded that the OpenBCI Spiderclaw V 1 electrodes placements are not optimum for motor imagery application. The average of accuracy measurements which was around 60 % for all subjects shows poor motor imagery performance. Furthermore, 16 channel electrodes configuration with a wide temporal filter range [8 - 30 Hz] showed better performance compared to other settings in this research. However, further study is needed to improve the statistical significance of these findings. On the MIQ- 3 results, kinesthetic imagery score reflects the most correlated with the accuracy measurement, supporting the suggestion that questionnaire could be used to predict user's motor imagery performance...|$|E

40|$|The {{desire to}} solve {{problems}} caused by socket prostheses in transfemoral amputees and the acquired success of osseointegration in the dental application {{has led to the}} introduction of osseointegration in the orthopedic surgery. Since its first introduction in 1990 in Gothenburg Sweden the osseointegrated (OI) orthopedic fixation has proven several benefits[1]. The surgery consists of two surgical procedures followed by a lengthy rehabilitation program. The rehabilitation program after an OI implant includes a specific training period with a short <b>training</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> Since mechanical loading is considered {{to be one of the}} key factors that influence bone mass and the osseointegration of bone-anchored implants, the rehabilitation program will also need to include some form of load bearing exercises (LBE). To date there are two frequently used commercially available human implants. We can find proof in the literature that load bearing exercises are performed by patients with both types of OI implants. We refer to two articles, a first one written by Dr. Aschoff and all and published in 2010 in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. [2] The second one presented by Hagberg et al in 2009 gives a very thorough description of the rehabilitation program of TFA fitted with an OPRA implant. The progression of the load however is determined individually according to the residual skeleton’s quality, pain level and body weight of the participant. [1] Patients are using a classical bathroom weighing scale to control the load on the implant during the course of their rehabilitation. The bathroom scale is an affordable and easy-to-use device but it has some important shortcomings. The scale provides instantaneous feedback to the patient only on the magnitude of the vertical component of the applied force. The forces and moments applied along and around the three axes of the implant are unknown. Although there are different ways to assess the load on the implant for instance through inverse dynamics in a motion analysis laboratory [3 - 6] this assessment is challenging. A recent proof- of-concept study by Frossard et al (2009) showed that the shortcomings of the weighing scale can be overcome by a portable kinetic system based on a commercial transducer[7]...|$|E
40|$|The current {{prevalence}} of persons amputated at transmetatarsal level or higher in Sweden {{can be estimated}} to be between 5000 and 5500 persons (approx. 0. 06 % of the population). The majority of these are patients with vascular disease (≈ 80 %). In Sweden between 1000 and 1100 new amputees can be expect every year. Less than 5 % of all amputations will be related to causes other than vascular disease. Lower limb amputation (LEA) in patients with vascular disease may not only be highly disabling but also costly in hospital management. The incidence differs between countries due to age structure of the population, {{prevalence of}} vascular disease and the prevalence of diabetes. In Paper I we prospectively evaluated LLA performed at transmetatarsal level or higher during 10 years. The overall incidence of initial unilateral amputation in the diabetic population was eight times higher compared with that in the nondiabetic population (195 vs. 23 per 100, 000 person-years). The incidence of contralateral amputation among diabetic amputees was 17 and among the nondiabetic amputees 13 per 100 amputee-years. The most frequent contralateral amputation level among the diabetic and nondiabetic patients was trans-tibial. The incidence of re-amputation among the diabetic amputees was 19 and among the nondiabetic amputees 14 per 100 amputee-years. The most frequent re-amputation level among diabetic patients was trans-tibial and among nondiabetic patients was trans-femoral. The 1 -year mortality rate, adjusted for age and gender, {{did not differ significantly}} between the two groups. In Paper II we introduce a Swedish version of the Locomotor Capabilities Index (LCI) outcome instrument and evaluate its reliability and validity. Following the process of translation and cultural adaptation, the Swedish version of the LCI was found to be reliable and valid instrument that can provide a standardized measure of amputee-centered outcomes. In Paper III we tested two different dressings after trans-tibial amputation, the conventional rigid dressing of plaster of Paris and a new vacuum-formed removable rigid dressing. The primary outcome measure was time to prosthetic fitting while the secondary outcomes included function with the prosthesis 3 months after amputation measured with the LCI and the Timed “Up and Go” (TUG) test. Twenty-seven consecutive patients were included and prosthetic fitting was achieved in 23 patients (mean age 76 years). The same postoperative treatment and rehabilitation was applied in both groups. To minimize the possible influence of using different types of prostheses in measuring functional outcome ICEX prosthetic sockets were used in all patients. The new vacuum-formed removable rigid dressing appear to yield similar results regarding wound healing, time to prosthetic fitting and function, rate of socket changes during the first year or return to previous dwelling when compared with conventional plaster of Paris rigid dressing. In Paper IV we prospectively evaluated the outcome of a standardized surgical and rehabilitation program in trans-tibial amputation in a large consecutive and population-based series of 219 patients. We analyzed the outcome regarding rate of prosthetic fitting, walking ability and mortality. A circular, plaster of Paris rigid dressing was applied by the surgeon in the operating room. This rigid dressing was removed after 5 to 7 days and compression treatment with a silicone liner was started. Ambulation with an ischial weight bearing <b>training</b> <b>prosthesis</b> was started when the plaster of Paris dressing was removed, with no load on the residual limb. A prosthetic socket that is cast and made directly on the residual limb using pressure casting technique, resulting in a definitive socket was used. Functioning was defined as good if the patient wore the prosthesis daily and was able to walk alone or with assistance outdoors or alone indoors. Functioning was defined as poor if the patient did not wear the prosthesis daily and was unable to walk indoors without assistance or used a wheelchair most or all the time or did not receive prosthesis. All prostheses were produced and delivered on the same visit to the prosthetic workshop. More than half of all amputees could be fitted with a prosthesis after a median time of six weeks and almost two-thirds have good function 3 months after amputation and the functional status remained unchanged at 1 year. Poor functional outcomes correlated with delayed prosthetic fitting and not living independently before amputation. Of the patients who could walk with or without an aid prior to the amputation and who survived at least 90 days after amputation, more than 80 % could be provided with a prosthesis with 68 % achieving good function. These patients can expect a median survival of approximately 3. 5 years...|$|E

The active functions are restricted to active pronation and supination, active gripping of the terminal device “hook ” or “hand”, com-bined with pneumatic locking of free swinging shoulder and elbow jdints in one artificial arm; the cosmetic arm provides only space for the power package in the resin socket of the upper arm.

Recently hybrid systems came into use be-cause electric power proved superior to pneu-matic power for pronation and supination and gripping, whereas CO, is still necessary for locking the elbow and the shoulder joint.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the relation between the magnitude of the intermanual transfer effect and the type of training task. The used tasks were based on different aspects of prosthetic handling: reaching, grasping, grip-force production and functional tasks. A single-blinded clinical trial, with a pre-posttest design was executed. Seventy-one able-bodied, right-handed participants were randomly assigned to four training and two control groups. The training groups performed a training program with an upper-limb prosthesis simulator. One control group performed a sham training (a dummy <b>training</b> without the <b>prosthesis</b> simulator) and another control group received no training at all. The training groups and sham group trained on five consecutive days. To determine the improvement in skills, a test was administered before, immediately after, and one week after the training. Training was performed with the 'unaffected' arm; tests were performed with the 'affected' arm, with the latter resembling the amputated limb. In this study half of the participants trained with the dominant hand, while the other half trained with the non-dominant hand. Participants executed four tests that corresponded to the different training tasks. The tests measured the reaching (movement time and symmetry ratio), grasping (opening time, duration of maximum hand opening, and closing time), grip-force production (deviation of asked grip-force) and functional (movement time) performance. Half of the participants were tested with their dominant arm and half of the participants with their non-dominant arm. Intermanual transfer effects were not found for reaching, grasping or functional tasks. However, we did find intermanual transfer effects for grip-force production tasks. Possibly, the study design contributed to the negative results due to the duration of the training sessions and test sessions. The positive results of the grip-force production might be an effect of the specificity of the training, that was totally focused on training grip-force production.

40|$|The {{electrical}} stimulation of {{a component of}} the human visual system can result in the perception of blobs of light (or phosphenes) in totally blind patients. By stimulating an array of closely aligned electrodes it is possible for a blind person to perceive very low-resolution phosphene images. Using this approach, a number of international research groups are working toward developing multiple electrode systems (called visual prostheses or Artificial Human Vision (AHV) systems) to provide a phosphene-based substitute for normal human vision. Computer vision methods provide a critical link between the camera and electrode array of an effective visual prothesis. Despite the promise of partially restoring sight to the blind, there are currently a number of constraints with current visual prosthesis systems. These include limitations in the number of electrodes which can be implanted and the perceived spatial layout and frame rate of phosphenes. Therefore the development of computer vision techniques that can maximize the value of the limited number of phosphenes would be useful in compensating for these constraints. In this paper a novel framework for the dynamic presentation of information to a visual prosthesis recipient is presented. This framework includes the main factors which impact on blind mobility. These factors include the current context, scene properties, task under-taken, available sensory information, and environmental factors, in addition to human factors (such as level of <b>training)</b> and <b>prosthesis</b> technology (for example, camera and electrode array technology).

40|$|Background: The {{problems}} of prescribing a prosthesis {{for a young}} girl with severe congenital vascular malformation deformity leading to a transtibial amputation. Case description and methods: Due to the high risk of recurrent bleeding and limitations regarding full weight bearing of the stump, a normal socket fitting process was not possible. Using a multidisciplinary approach, a prosthesis was designed to enable full weight bearing in a flexed knee position with ischial tuberosity support to prevent full weight bearing on the tibial part of the stump. Findings and outcomes: After training and adjustments to the design, a definitive prosthesis with a free motion mechanical knee joint could be used.

40|$|The way {{in which}} humans {{represent}} their own bodies is critical in guiding their interactions with the environment. To achieve successful body-space interactions, the body representation is strictly connected {{with that of the}} space immediately surrounding it through efficient visuo-tactile crossmodal integration. Such a body-space integrated representation is not fixed, but can be dynamically modulated by the use of external tools. Our study aims to explore the effect of using a complex tool, namely a functional prosthesis, on crossmodal visuo-tactile spatial interactions in healthy participants. By using the crossmodal visuo-tactile congruency paradigm, we found that prolonged training with a mechanical hand capable of distal hand movements and providing sensory feedback induces a pattern of interference, which is not observed after a brief training, between visual stimuli close to the prosthesis and touches on the body. These results suggest that after extensive, but not short, <b>training</b> the functional <b>prosthesis</b> acquires a visuo-tactile crossmodal representation akin to real limbs. This finding adds to previous evidence for the embodiment of functional prostheses in amputees, and shows that their use may also improve the crossmodal combination of somatosensory feedback delivered by the prosthesis with visual stimuli in the space around it, thus effectively augmenting the patients' visuomotor abilities...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} for pattern recognition to improve powered prosthesis control {{has been discussed}} for many years. One remaining barrier to at-home use of these techniques is that practical methods of user prompting during system training are lacking. Most {{research and development of}} pattern recognition systems for prosthesis control has relied on on-screen cues to prompt the prosthesis wearer during signal collection; therefore most systems require connection to a computer or external device. We have developed a method called Prosthesis-Guided Training (PGT) to address this issue. In PGT, the prosthesis itself moves through a pre-programmed sequence of motions to prompt the wearer to elicit the appropriate muscle contractions. PGT requires no extra hardware and allows wearers to retrain, refresh, or recalibrate the controller in many locations and situations. Training via PGT is self-initiated and requires only about 1 minute of the wearer’s time. Furthermore, PGT provides a practical mechanism for overcoming malfunctioning or changing inputs, addresses differences in routine donning, and results in acquisition of myoelectric signals representative of those elicited during functional use. Qualitative and quantitative data acquired to investigate the efficacy of PGT suggest that it is an intuitive, effective, and clinically viable method of <b>training</b> pattern recognition–controlled <b>prostheses...</b>|$|R
40|$|Grasping is {{a complex}} task {{routinely}} performed in an anticipatory (feedforward) manner, where sensory feedback is responsible for learning and updating the internal model of grasp dynamics. This study aims at evaluating whether providing a proportional tactile force feedback during the myoelectric control of a prosthesis facilitates learning a stable internal model of the prosthesis force control. Ten able-bodied subjects controlled a sensorized myoelectric prosthesis performing four blocks of consecutive grasps at three levels of target force (30, 50, and 70 %), repeatedly closing the fully opened hand. In {{the first and third}} block, the subjects received tactile and visual feedback, respectively, while during the second and fourth block, the feedback was removed. The subjects also performed an additional block with no feedback 1 day after the training (Retest). The median and interquartile range of the generated forces was computed to assess the accuracy and precision of force control. The results demonstrated that the feedback was indeed an effective instrument for the <b>training</b> of <b>prosthesis</b> control. After the training, the subjects were still able to accurately generate the desired force for the low and medium target (30 and 50 % of maximum force available in a prosthesis), despite the feedback being removed within the session and during the retest (low target force). However, the training was substantially less successful for high forces (70 % of prosthesis maximum force), where subjects exhibited a substantial loss of accuracy as soon as the feedback was removed. The precision of control decreased with higher forces and it was consistent across conditions, determined by an intrinsic variability of repeated myoelectric grasping. This study demonstrated that the subject could rely on the tactile feedback to adjust the motor command to the prosthesis across trials. The subjects adjusted the mean level of muscle activation (accuracy), whereas the precision could not be modulated as it depends on the intrinsic myoelectric variability. They were also able to maintain the feedforward command even after the feedback was removed, demonstrating thereby a stable learning, but the retention depended on the level of the target force. This is an important insight into the role of feedback as an instrument for learning of anticipatory prosthesis force control...|$|R

Development and evaluation of command and control schemes for such devices typically require real-time, "patient-in-the-loop" experimentation. A real-time, 3 -D, musculoskeletal model of the upper limb has been developed for use in a simulation environment to allow such testing to be carried out noninvasively. The model provides real-time feedback of human arm dynamics that can be displayed to the user in a virtual reality environment. The model has a 3 -DOF glenohumeral joint as well as elbow flexion/extension and pronation/supination and contains 22 muscles of the shoulder and elbow divided into multiple elements. The model is able to run in real time on modest desktop hardware and demonstrates that a large-scale, 3 -D model can be made to run in real time. This is a prerequisite for a real-time, whole-arm model that will form part of a dynamic arm simulator for use in the development, testing, and user <b>training</b> of neural <b>prosthesis</b> systems.

40|$|Improvement in {{prosthetic}} training using intermanual transfer (the {{transfer of}} motor skills from the trained, "unaffected" {{hand to the}} untrained, "affected" hand) {{has been shown in}} previous studies. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the influence of the inter-training interval on the magnitude of the intermanual transfer effects. This was done using a mechanistic, randomized, single-blinded pretest-posttest design. Sixty-four able-bodied, righthanded participants were randomly assigned to the Short and Long Interval Training Groups and the Short and Long Interval Control Groups. The Short and Long Interval Training Groups used a prosthesis simulator in their training program. The Short and Long Interval Control Groups executed a sham training program, that is, a dummy training program in which the same muscles were trained as with the prosthesis simulator. The Short Interval Training Group and the Short Interval Control Groups trained on consecutive days, while the Long Interval Training Group and Long Interval Control Group trained twice a week. To determine the improvement in skills, a test was administered before, immediately after, and at two points in time after the training. Training was performed with the "unaffected" arm; tests were performed with the "affected" arm. The outcome measurements were: the movement time (the time from the beginning of the movement until completion of the task); the duration of maximum hand opening, (the opening of the prosthetic hand while grasping an object); and the grip-force control (the error from the required grip-force during a tracking task). Intermanual transfer was found in movement times, but not in hand opening or gripforce control. The length of the inter-training interval did not affect the magnitude of intermanual transfer effects. No difference in the intermanual transfer effect in upper-limb <b>prosthesis</b> <b>training</b> was found for training on a daily basis as compared to training twice a week...|$|R
