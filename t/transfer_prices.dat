A precise model is applied in this study to interpret enterprise's <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> in practice. Furthermore, this model is also used to assess the <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> profit of listing/OTC electronics companies in Taiwan and study the factors affecting <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> profit. The empirical results show that material expense ratio significantly impacts <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> profit.

This study also finds that regardless of whether the net income of corporate <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> transactions is high, medium, or low, the proportion of material costs is positively and significantly correlated with the net income of corporate <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> transactions in all scenarios. Higher profit will be affected by exchange rate.

Lastly, it aims at evaluating the relationship between <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> determinants and <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> methods and at discovering a means of predicting the latter from the company's perception of the relative importance of these determinants. To achieve the above objectives, an empirical study covering both domestic and international markets was undertaken in UK companies. The conclusions are concerned with <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> policy, methods currently used, and problems apparent in practice. The overall ranking-by survey respondents of the <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> determinants is given as well as the results of tests of certain hypotheses which relate to this ranking.
