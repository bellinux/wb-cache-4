5|$|Clark is {{best known}} as a war hero of the Revolutionary War in the West, {{especially}} {{as the leader of the}} secret expeditionary forces that captured Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and Vincennes in 1778–79. Some historians have suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> supported American claims to the Northwest Territory during negotiations that resulted in the Treaty of Paris (1783).|$|E
5|$|Eventually the British {{government}} decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> in Sudan {{was not worth}} the effort required and left a garrison in Suakin. The New South Wales Contingent sailed for home on 17 May, arriving in Sydney on 19 June 1885. Approximately 770 Australians served in Sudan; nine subsequently died of disease during the return journey while three had been wounded during the campaign.|$|E
5|$|In May 2010, the Barr {{campaign}} was sued by libertarian pundit Jim Bovard, {{who was hired}} to ghostwrite {{a book about the}} campaign. Bovard claims he was never paid the $47,000 he was to receive for his efforts. Campaign manager Russ Verney stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> hoped to raise enough money to pay Bovard, and asked for donations. The ensuing litigation resulted in a judgment entered for Bovard against the Bar 2008 Presidential Committee, Inc., in the full amount of $47,000.00.|$|E

5|$|The {{amount of}} content {{featured}} in the game received mixed reviews. Miller thought that the game only revolved around one idea, which led to its simplistic gameplay. Camron and Cooper thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> was too short for most players. Shoemaker thought that for a full-priced game, it lacked content. Reiner furthered criticized the game's low replay value. Carter advocated that players purchase the game when its price dropped. He added that while the game features lots of ideas, most of them failed to deliver.|$|E
5|$|American {{analysts were}} elated when they {{discovered}} {{that the number of}} trucks ordered by North Vietnam from its communist allies in late 1971 exceeded those of previous years. 6,000 vehicles had been ordered from the Soviet Union alone (as opposed to the usual 3,000) and this seemed to indicate that the enemy was hurting for transportation and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> was working. However, since 80 percent of the vehicles arrived in North Vietnam at least six weeks before the launching of the Nguyen Hue Offensive (known to the U.S. as the Easter Offensive, they probably reflected anticipated losses.|$|E
5|$|In August 1810, the French {{squadron}} on Isle de France (now Mauritius) {{achieved the}} most significant French naval victory of the Napoleonic Wars, when they captured or destroyed four Royal Navy frigates at the Battle of Grand Port. The battle was fought inside Grand Port, one of the harbours of Isle de France into which the French squadrons, dominant in the Indian Ocean during 1809, had been steadily pushed and blockaded by pressure from a British squadron under Commodore Josias Rowley. The British defeat had a noticeable galvanising effect on both the British and French naval commands: both recognised <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> would be won by the first to reinforce and resupply their forces. Although the French had achieved a significant victory, the naval bases on Isle de France lacked the military stores and food supplies to repair the battle damage to their ships or supply lengthy raiding voyages against British trade routes.|$|E

5|$|More {{extensive}} coverage {{has been given}} by some sites. VentureBeat noted that, while comparable with other similar campaigns, Operation Rainfall was notable for maintaining civility during its efforts. Zach Kaplan of Nintendo Life said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> {{needed to make a}} clear mark, showing that the success of the then-announced Xenoblade Chronicles was not a fluke. In a later feature for the same website, Thomas Whitehead said that the otherwise niche and slightly unremarkable Pandora's Tower had been granted a level of mystique and anticipation among fans through its inclusion in the Operation Rainfall campaign. In an interview feature conducted after the announcement of a North American release for Pandora's Tower, PC World noted that Operation Rainfall was going against the trend with its complete success in pushing to bring all three titles to North America. In particular, it compared them to the unsuccessful efforts by fans to bring Japan-exclusive entries of the Mother series to the West.|$|E
5|$|The JNA's {{offensive}} operations, directly {{associated with}} the campaign in the east Croatian region of Slavonia, were launched on 20 September. The assault on Croatian positions in Vukovar gradually became the main effort of the campaign as the JNA was repeatedly unable to capture the city. The fighting in and around Vukovar lasted months and eventually drew in the JNA's main armoured force, which had previously been slated to advance west towards Serb-held areas in western Slavonia. In addition to relieving its Vukovar garrison, the JNA wished to dissipate the Croatian forces in the city {{so that they would}} not pose any threat to its rear in the event <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> progressed west of Vinkovci.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{campaign}} received mixed impressions from reviewers. USgamer editor Jaz Rignall {{thought it}} was great for teaching the mechanics of the game and the progression of difficulty was reasonable. GameSpot reviewer Kallie Plagge thought the highest points of the campaign missions were the sequences that borrowed elements from the main Halo games. Brown stated that while the campaign was brief, he felt it had good pacing and there was a decent variety of objectives and scenarios. Stapleton agreed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> missions offered enough variety to prevent them from becoming repetitive. However, overall he was unimpressed by the campaign missions, which he perceived as unambitious in their design. He was also surprised by the frequent bugs, which included crashing and mission events failing to trigger, that he experienced during his playthrough of the campaign on the Xbox One.|$|E

5|$|This victory {{ultimately}} cost Napoleon his army, as {{it allowed}} the French emperor to believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> was winnable, exhausting his forces {{as he went}} on to Moscow to await a surrender that would never come. Historian Rhiem notes that the Borodino victory allowed Napoleon to move on to Moscow, where—even allowing for the arrival of reinforcements—the French Army only possessed a maximum of 95,000men, who would be ill-equipped to win a battle {{due to a lack of}} supplies and ammunition. The Grande Armée suffered 66% of its casualties by the time of the Moscow retreat; snow, starvation, and typhus ensured that only 23,000men crossed the Russian border alive. Furthermore, while the Russian army suffered heavy casualties in the battle, they had fully recovered by the time of Napoleon's retreat from Moscow; they immediately began to interfere with the French withdrawal, costing Napoleon much of his surviving army.|$|E
5|$|Writing {{after the}} war, Robert McNamara stated that by spring 1967 {{he and other}} civilians in the {{administration}} had become convinced that both Rolling Thunder and the ground war in South Vietnam were not working. McNamara claimed that he and others within the administration continuously opposed the Joint Chief's recommendations for an increased tempo of bombing and the loosening of target restrictions. The generals found themselves on the horns of a dilemma of their own making. They continuously claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> was working, yet they also had to continuously demand greater latitude {{in order to make}} the campaign succeed. The limited goals entailed in American foreign policy and the military's goal of total victory were simply not reconcilable. The great conundrum had then become how to defeat North Vietnam without defeating North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, signed in 1939, Nazi Germany began Operation Barbarossa—the {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union—on 22 June 1941. Initially the Luftwaffe was at an advantage, destroying thousands of Soviet aircraft {{in the first month}} of fighting. Hitler and his top staff were sure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> would be over by Christmas, and no provisions were made for reserves of men or equipment. But, by July, the Germans had only 1,000 planes remaining in operation, and their troop losses were over 213,000 men. The choice was made to concentrate the attack on only one part of the vast front; efforts would be directed at capturing Moscow. After the long, but successful, Battle of Smolensk, Hitler ordered Army Group Centre to halt its advance to Moscow and temporarily diverted its Panzer groups north and south to aid in the encirclement of Leningrad and Kiev. The pause provided the Red Army with an opportunity to mobilize fresh reserves; historian Russel Stolfi considers it {{to be one of the}} major factors that caused the failure of the Moscow offensive, which was resumed in October 1941 with the Battle of Moscow. Poor weather conditions, fuel shortages, a delay in building aircraft bases in Eastern Europe, and overstretched supply lines were also factors. Hitler did not give permission for even a partial retreat until mid-January 1942; by this time the losses were comparable to those of the French invasion of Russia in 1812.|$|E

5|$|Skanderbeg's {{view of the}} {{situation}} worsened with news coming from Albania, which strengthened his opinion that his time in Italy was {{becoming more and more}} irrational. His pessimism grew once he found out that Venice was now pressuring Paul into refusing Skanderbeg aid since they wished {{to put an end to}} the war and capitulate Krujë. During the first days of February, news arrived from the Republic of Ragusa <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> was nearing its end and that if the necessary actions were not brought up to speed, Albania would fall along with Venice's possessions. Skanderbeg's requests for proper aid were continually rejected on the basis that Italy's peace must first be secured and instead Paul ordered Ferdinand to award to Skanderbeg what tribute would have been given to Rome. Skanderbeg lost all hope and decided to return to Albania before pleas from several cardinals convinced to stay, offering aid from their own pockets and hope in persuading Paul. A third consistory was convened on 13 February 1467 which, like the other two, came to nothing regarding aid to Skanderbeg. Skanderbeg thus began his departure from Rome. Paul met with Skanderbeg and gave him the authority to pull 7,500 ducats from Ferdinand's aforementioned tribute to Rome. This amount had not been gathered, however, and Paul thus offered Skanderbeg 2,300 ducats. Skanderbeg departed from Rome on 14 February and soon received news from Albania: the war was nearing its end and needed Skanderbeg to return; an Ottoman force sent to defeat the League of Lezhë definitively, however, had been defeated. He met with Giosafat Barbaro in Scutari, the Venetian provveditore in Albania Veneta, where he gathered help from Venetian nobles.|$|E
