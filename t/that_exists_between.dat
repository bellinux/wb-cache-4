5|$|There is a race {{prejudice}} <b>that</b> <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> {{the white}} and Negro races wherever the Negroes are found in large numbers.... Just this week the announcement comes {{as a shock to}} the people of Oklahoma that the Secretary of the Interior... has appointed a Negro from Kansas to come to Oklahoma and take charge of the supervision of the Indian schools of this State. There is no race of people on earth that has more antipathy for the Negro race than the Indian race, and yet these people, numbering many of the best citizens of this State and nation, are to be humbled and their prejudices and passions are to be increased by having this outrage imposed upon them... If your organization would interest itself to the extent of seeing that such outrages as this are not perpetrated against our people, there would be fewer lynchings in the South than at this time...|$|E
5|$|Outer space, or just space, is {{the expanse}} <b>that</b> <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> {{celestial}} bodies, including Earth. Outer space {{is not completely}} empty, but consists of a hard vacuum containing a low density of particles, predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, neutrinos, dust, and cosmic rays. The baseline temperature, as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang, is 2.7kelvins (K) (−270.45°C; −454.81°F). Plasma with a number density of less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a temperature of millions of kelvins {{in the space between}} galaxies accounts for most of the baryonic (ordinary) matter in outer space; local concentrations have condensed into stars and galaxies. Observations indicate that 90% of the mass in most galaxies is in an unknown form, called dark matter, which interacts with other matter through gravitational but not electromagnetic forces. Other observations indicate {{that the majority of the}} mass-energy in the observable universe is a poorly understood vacuum energy of space which astronomers label dark energy. Intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the Universe, but even galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{some of the}} interrelations <b>that</b> <b>exist</b> <b>between</b> rural China's peasant {{economy and}} the wider economy {{in which it is}} embedded. In doing so it focuses on the circular flows that link town and countryside. Multiple job holding is strategic in this respect. The paper draws on research undertaken in a peasant village in Hebei Province. The research highlights some remarkable differences <b>that</b> <b>exist</b> <b>between</b> development processes in China and in other developing countries and traces these back to a combination of an enlightened rural policy and the strong linkages <b>that</b> <b>exist</b> <b>between</b> rural China and its urban 'global factory...|$|R

25|$|Taking an {{interdisciplinary}} approach to engineering systems is inherently complex since {{the behavior of}} and interaction among system components is not always immediately well defined or understood.

25|$|In astronomy, the {{interstellar}} medium (or ISM) is the gas and cosmic dust that pervade interstellar space: the matter <b>that</b> <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> the star systems within a galaxy. It fills interstellar space and blends smoothly into the surrounding intergalactic medium. The interstellar medium consists of an extremely dilute (by terrestrial standards) mixture of ions, atoms, molecules, larger dust grains, cosmic rays, and (galactic) magnetic fields. The energy that occupies the same volume, {{in the form of}} electromagnetic radiation, is {{the interstellar}} radiation field.|$|E
25|$|The {{failure of}} {{assimilation}} of Muslim immigrants communities in Europe together with {{economic and social}} problems {{and the spread of}} fundamentalist ideas among the Muslim youth in Europe has led to radicalization inside the Muslim communities and especially among the youth. This, together with the escalation of the Israeli- Palestinian conflict and the failure of the Oslo peace process, the Jews in Europe were more and more perceived as promoters and favorers of pro-Israeli ideas. Thus, the line <b>that</b> <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> antisemitism and anti-Zionism sometimes became blurry.|$|E

25|$|Bees {{provide a}} good example of the {{mutualism}} <b>that</b> <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> hymenopterans and angiosperms. Flowers provide bees with nectar (an energy source) and pollen (a source of protein). When bees go from flower to flower collecting pollen they are also depositing pollen grains onto the flowers, thus pollinating them. While pollen and nectar, in most cases, are the most notable reward attained from flowers, bees also visit flowers for other resources such as oil, fragrance, resin and even waxes. It has been estimated that bees originated with the origin or diversification of angiosperms. In addition, cases of coevolution between bee species and flowering plants have been illustrated by specialized adaptations. For example, long legs are selected for in Rediviva neliana, a bee that collects oil from Diascia capsularis, which have long spur lengths that are selected for in order to deposit pollen on the oil-collecting bee, which in turn selects for even longer legs in R. neliana and again longer spur length in D. capsularis is selected for, thus, continually driving each other's evolution.|$|E
25|$|Global {{justice is}} the {{paramount}} to global security, because injustice {{can lead to}} feelings of anger, humiliation, and alienation, which can undermine human dignity. Al-Rodhan argues that humans are primarily driven by emotional self-interest and that protecting humans’ emotional needs is fundamental to human well-being and human dignity. When people {{feel that they have}} been the victim of unjust decisions, they may try and seek justice by less conventional means such as violence. This, in turn, can promote insecurity. Therefore, justice and not just military power, is essential to maintaining global security. Some obstacles might however arise. Al-Rodhan identifies the disparity in power <b>that</b> <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> states in the current global order as a major obstacle in achieving global justice. Calls for greater global justice are thus likely to continue from disadvantaged societies because they often feel that they are unjustly subjected to the rules set by more powerful players. However, dominant states that benefit from the current status quo are unlikely to want to alter established institutions or governance structures.|$|E
25|$|However, not {{all humans}} possess {{the same number}} of copies of the AMY1 gene. Populations known to rely more on {{carbohydrates}} have a higher number of AMY1 copies than human populations that, by comparison, consume little starch. The number of AMY1 gene copies in humans can range from six copies in agricultural groups such as European-American and Japanese (two high starch populations) to only 2-3 copies in hunter-gatherer societies such as the Biaka, Datog, and Yakuts. The correlation <b>that</b> <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> starch consumption and number of AMY1 copies specific to population suggest that more AMY1 copies in high starch populations has been selected for by natural selection and considered the favorable phenotype for those individuals. Therefore, it is most likely that the benefit of an individual possessing more copies of AMY1 in a high starch population increases fitness and produces healthier, fitter offspring. This fact is especially apparent when comparing geographically close populations with different eating habits that possess a different number of copies of the AMY1 gene. Such is the case for some Asian populations that have been shown to possess few AMY1 copies relative to some agricultural population in Asia. This offers strong evidence that natural selection has acted on this gene as opposed to the possibility that the gene has spread through genetic drift.|$|E

500|$|Theater expert Marvin Rosenberg theorises that Macbeth has a son, and {{interprets the}} play as {{commenting on the}} rivalries between pairs of father and son: Banquo and Fleance, Macduff and his son, Macbeth and his. [...] He argues that the tension <b>that</b> <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> Fleance and Macbeth is made {{stronger}} if Macbeth has a child: his motive is not just selfish striving, but also fatherly ambition for his own son. But this interpretation is flawed because in IV:iii, as soon as Macduff hears that MacBeth [...] has murdered his whole family, he says: [...] "He has no children." [...] Some productions of Macbeth imply that the Macbeths have lost a child, or show this tenderness by having the title character attempt to pat Fleance on the head, when Fleance withdraws to his father's side.|$|E

Corliss wrote that Kurt's [...] "smackdown of his father has the odor of propaganda from the gayest show in TV history". Canning said he was [...] "moved by Kurt asking his father {{to step out of}} his comfort zone and educate himself about what is gay men do when [...] together", and Gonzalez enjoyed [...] "the very realistic tension <b>that</b> <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> them as father and gay son".|$|E

500|$|Esophageal varices are swollen twisted {{branches}} of the azygous vein in the lower third of the esophagus. These blood vessels [...] anastomose (join up) {{with those of the}} portal vein when portal hypertension develops. These blood vessels are engorged more than normal, and in the worst cases may partially obstruct the esophagus. These blood vessels develop as part of a collateral circulation that occurs to drain blood from the abdomen as a result of portal hypertension, usually as a result of liver diseases such as cirrhosis. This collateral circulation occurs because {{the lower part of the}} esophagus drains into the left gastric vein, which is a branch of the portal vein. Because of the extensive venous plexus <b>that</b> <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> this vein and other veins, if portal hypertension occurs, the direction of blood drainage in this vein may reverse, with blood draining from the portal venous system, through the plexus. Veins in the plexus may engorge and lead to varices.|$|E
