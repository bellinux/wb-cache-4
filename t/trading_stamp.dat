2500|$|The Co-operative Food, {{the brand}} adopted {{by many of}} the larger members of the UK {{co-operative}} movement does not operate a traditional loyalty card scheme. Instead, as consumer co-operatives, they operate a profit sharing scheme whereby an annual dividend is paid to all member-owners which is proportional to the total spend with the businesses during the previous year. Such dividend schemes have existed since the Rochdale Pioneers of the 1840s. Paper record-keeping transformed in the 1960s into a <b>trading</b> <b>stamp</b> scheme managed by the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS), which was gradually withdrawn as margins declined. [...] The loyalty card concept was used by some co-operatives to restore dividend payments {{at the turn of the}} 21st century, notably by the CWS's [...] "Dividend" [...] card, which was replaced by The Co-operative Membership card program. The current members' dividend scheme is provided using the national co-operative brand and allows members of The Co-operative Group and many of the larger regional co-operative societies to earn their 'share of the profits' based upon their spend at many of the outlets which use The Co-operative brand rather than just at their own co-operative society (e.g. The Co-operative Group or the Midcounties Co-operative).|$|E
6000|$|The Bumpus flat {{included}} {{the second floor}} of a small wooden house whose owner had once been evilly inspired to paint it a livid clay-yellow--as though insisting that ugliness were an essential attribute of domesticity. A bay ran up the two stories, and at the left were two narrow doorways, one for each flat. On the right the house was separated from its neighbour by a narrow interval, giving but a precarious light to the two middle rooms, the diningroom and kitchen. The very unattractiveness of such a home, however, had certain compensations for Janet, after the effort of early rising had been surmounted, felt a real relief in leaving it; a relief, too, in leaving Fillmore Street, every feature of which was indelibly fixed in her mind, opposite was the blind brick face of a warehouse, and next to that the converted dwelling house that held the shop of A. Bauer, with the familiar replica of a green ten-cent <b>trading</b> <b>stamp</b> painted above it and the somewhat ironical announcement--when boar frost whitened the pavement--that ice-cold soda was to be had within, as well as cigars and tobacco, fruit and candy. Then came a tenement, under which two enterprising Greeks by the name of Pappas--spelled Papas lower down--conducted a business called [...] "The Gentleman," [...] a tailoring, pressing, and dyeing establishment. Janet could see the brilliantined black heads of the two proprietors bending over their boards, and sometimes they would be lifted to smile at her as she passed. The Pappas Brothers were evidently as happy in this drab environment as they had ever been on the sunny mountain slopes of Hellas, and Janet sometimes wondered at this, for she had gathered from her education in the Charming public school that Greece was beautiful.|$|E

5000|$|In 1896 the Sperry and Hutchinson Company {{was created}} as an {{independent}} <b>trading</b> <b>stamp</b> company in the United States and by 1957 {{it was estimated that}} there were approximately 200 <b>trading</b> <b>stamp</b> companies in operation. [...] Typically, merchants would pay a third-party <b>trading</b> <b>stamp</b> company for the stamps and would then advertise that they gave away trading stamps with purchases. Large retailers were usually given a discount on the stamps while smaller retailers generally had to pay the full cost of adopting the <b>trading</b> <b>stamp</b> program for their business. The intent of this was to get customers to be loyal to the merchant, so that they would continue shopping there to obtain enough stamps to redeem for merchandise. Customers would fill books with stamps, and take the books to a <b>trading</b> <b>stamp</b> company redemption center to exchange them for premiums. [...] Books could also be sent to the <b>trading</b> <b>stamp</b> company in exchange for premium merchandise via mail order catalogs. An example of the value of trading stamps would be during the 1970s and 1980s where the typical rate issued by a merchant was one stamp for each 10¢ of merchandise purchased. A typical book took approximately 1200 stamps to fill, or the equivalent of US $120.00 in purchases.|$|E

The customers were instructed to paste the S&H stamps into booklets, and when they had accumulated enough booklets full of S&H stamps they could “redeem” them at an S&H redemption center for “gifts”—merchandise, such as golf clubs or blenders.
