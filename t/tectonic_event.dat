5|$|The {{accretion}} of Siletzia {{against the}} North American continent approximately 50 {{million years ago}} (contemporaneous with the initiation of the bend in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain) was a major <b>tectonic</b> <b>event</b> associated with a reorganization of the earth's tectonic plates.

5|$|The oldest {{activity}} is an ignimbrite erupted 0.65 ± 0.18 mya, called the Tuzgle ignimbrite. On {{the rim of}} the caldera left by this eruption is a lava dome complex named the Old Complex Unit. 0.3 ± 0.1 mya ago effusive activity commenced with the Pre-platform and Platform units that were then followed by a <b>tectonic</b> <b>event</b> that dissected these units. Afterwards, the Post-platform and Young Flow Units were erupted. The youngest unit is latitic and was dated 0.1 ± (0.1-0.3) mya ago. This unit may be Holocene or PleistoceneHolocene in age. It is possible that the continuing activity of the Chorrillos fault zone is compressing the magma chamber and feeder dyke of Tuzgle, thus impeding eruptive activity. The well-preserved summit crater and youthful-looking lava flows have been assigned Holocene ages.|$|E

The first deposits occurred during {{the initial stages of}} extension of the Great Lakes tectonic zone in the continental crust. As the crust expanded it thinned, and magma was intruded through fissures in the thinned crust. Sedimentation stopped during this transitional period because the elevation was now above sea level. During later stages, the spreading center was adding oceanic crust ndash& which is heavier than continental crust ndash& so the area subsided, seas returned, and the second layer of sediments were deposited unconformably on the basin fill.|$|E

2500|$|Collision began {{along the}} Great Lakes tectonic zone (GLTZ) with the Algoman mountain-building event and {{continued}} {{for tens of}} millions of years. During the formation of the GLTZ, the gneissic Minnesota River Valley subprovince was thrust up onto the Superior province's edge as it consumed the Superior province's oceanic crust. Fragmentation of the Kenorland supercontinent began [...] and was completed by [...] The Wyoming province is the continental landmass that is hypothesized to have rifted away from the southern Superior province portion of Kenorland, before moving rapidly west and docking with the Laurentia supercontinent 1,850 to 1,715 million years ago. Sedimentation from the GLTZ-rifting environment continued into the Penokean orogeny, which is the next major <b>tectonic</b> <b>event</b> in the Great Lakes region. Several earthquakes have been documented in Minnesota, Michigan's Upper Peninsula and Sudbury in the last 120 years along the GLTZ.|$|E
2500|$|About [...] {{a fourth}} <b>tectonic</b> <b>event</b> {{occurred}} in the Lake Superior region. A hotspot of magma from the earth’s mantle beneath present-day Lake Superior rose, causing the crust to dome and break apart. This zone of crustal thinning and fracturing is the Midcontinent Rift System; it extends in a boomerang shape for over [...] from northeastern Kansas northward through Iowa, under the Twin Cities of Minnesota, beneath Lake Superior, and then south through the eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan and beneath the central Lower Peninsula of Michigan. As the crust was being stretched thin and more magma flowed out from below, {{the center of the}} rift was continuously subsiding. The vast quantities of rising magma created a vacuum under the crust, the weight of the solidified magma on the surface caused the crust to subside into that vacuum so the edges of the rift tilted toward the center. The rifting stopped after a few million years; one reason could be that the Grenville orogeny stopped the rift process when that collision occurred. Subsidence continued for several million years after the lava flows had ceased; immense volumes of sediments ndash& sand, gravel and mud ndash& were eroded off the barren landscape into the still-sinking basin along the rift axis. As much as [...] of sedimentary rocks accumulated in the center before the sinking stopped and the region stabilized. A north-northeast trending branch of the Midcontinent Rift System separated the Animikie Basin into two distinct segments; the present-day Animikie Group and the Marquette Range Supergroup; the historical name for the Marquette Range Supergroup is the Animikie Series.|$|E
