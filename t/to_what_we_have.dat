Despite intensive artillery support (272 guns on a [...] front), the tired and understrength New Zealand battalions {{struggled to make}} progress. By the afternoon, it had become clear to the New Zealand commander—Bernard Freyberg—that the stubborn defences of the 26th Panzer Division would not be broached. He {{is reported to have}} remarked, [...] "It {{is not a question of}} further advance, it is a question of holding on <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> got". The XIII Corps front was effectively deadlocked and settled into a posture of active defence and patrolling.|$|E

In an 1882 letter to Robert Bridges, Hopkins writes: [...] "It makes one weep to think what English might have been; for {{in spite of all}} that Shakespeare and Milton have done [...] no beauty in a language can make up for want of purity". He took time to learn Old English, which became a major influence on his writing. In the same letter to Bridges he calls Old English [...] "a vastly superior thing <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> now".|$|E

2500|$|He {{rejected}} petitioners' {{suggestion that}} an employer [...] "must be {{in violation of}} the disparate-impact provision before it can use compliance as a defense in a disparate-treatment suit." [...] This rule would run counter <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> recognized as Congress's intent that [...] "voluntary compliance" [...] be [...] "the preferred means of achieving the objectives of Title VII." [...] Forbidding employers to act unless they know, with certainty, that a practice violates the disparate-impact provision would bring compliance efforts to a near standstill. Even in the limited situations when this restricted standard could be met, employers likely would hesitate before taking voluntary action for fear of later being proven wrong in the course of litigation and then held to account for disparate treatment.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{the future}} of the students, not the future of the parents, that is imperiled by today's decision. If a parent keeps his child out of school beyond the grade school, then the child will be forever barred from entry into the new and amazing world of {{diversity}} that we have today. The child may decide that that is the preferred course, or he may rebel. It is the student's judgment, not his parents', that is essential if we are to give full meaning <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> said about the Bill of Rights and of the right of students to be masters of their own destiny.
