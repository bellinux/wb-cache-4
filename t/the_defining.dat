The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess postoperative changes in antihypertensive drug consumption in patients with primary aldosteronism using <b>the</b> <b>defined</b> daily dose as the unit of measurement. Methods: This retrospective study included 110 Japanese patients who underwent unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy between 1995 and 2012. Antihypertensive drug doses were calculated according to the standard of <b>the</b> <b>defined</b> daily dose recommended by the World Health Organization to compare drug use. After assessing postoperative changes in antihypertensive drug consumption, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify clinical predictors for a 75 % or greater decrease in <b>the</b> <b>defined</b> daily dose. Results: Consumption of antihypertensive drugs decreased postoperatively in 95. 4 % of patients. The median decrease in <b>the</b> <b>defined</b> daily dose was 76. 8 %.

5|$|As the {{population}} of the territory grew, so did the people's exercising of their freedoms. In 1809, the territory was granted permission to fully elect its own legislature for the first time. Before that, Governor Harrison appointed the legislature. Although Article 6 of the Northwest Ordinance had prohibited slavery, it had existed in the region since French rule. In addition, settlers from the Upper South occupied areas along the Ohio River, bringing slaves with them. They wanted to have it be legal in the territory, but others from the northern states opposed the expansion of slavery into this region. The anti-slavery party won a strong majority in the first election. Governor Harrison was at odds with the new legislature, which proceeded to overturn the indenturing and pro-slavery laws he had enacted. Slavery remained <b>the</b> <b>defining</b> issue in the state for the decades to follow. In these early decades, although the legislature did not encourage free blacks to settle here, it extended suffrage to them.|$|E

In a survey conducted by The Guardian in 2006, Peterloo came second to the Putney Debates as the event from radical British history that most deserved a proper monument or a memorial.

5|$|Inocybe praetervisa is a small, {{yellow and}} brown {{mushroom}} in the Inocybaceae family, distinguished from {{other members of}} the genus by its unusual spores and bulb.

However, it is a part of several clades within the genus Inocybe. I.praetervisa grows on the ground in woodland, favouring beech trees, and can be found in Europe, North America and Asia.
