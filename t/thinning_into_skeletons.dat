5000|$|The greedy {{and evil}} baron tried {{to seize the}} Lightstar crystal for himself, and caused it to break in two. His half turned him <b>into</b> a living <b>skeleton</b> who {{has the power to}} turn any person with the {{slightest}} bit of darkness in his or her heart <b>into</b> a <b>skeleton</b> warrior like himself. Baron turns them <b>into</b> <b>skeleton</b> warriors with [...] "Heartstones," [...] and he says [...] "Darkest Soul, Evil's Courier, Serve me as a Skeleton Warrior." [...] He is obsessed with defeating the Legion of Light, and taking control of both halves of the Lightstar Crystal, thereby granting absolute power for himself.|$|R

25|$|During the Neolithic, La Garma {{was less}} and less used as a {{residential}} site. From the Chalcolithic through the Bronze Age, it was used primarily as a collective burial site. The peculiar remains of five Visigothic youths were found deep in the cave system. Their skulls had all been deliberately crushed after the bodies had turned <b>into</b> <b>skeletons.</b>|$|R
50|$|The First Challenge:Each team {{is given}} a block of ice in which plastic replicas of human bones are buried.

50|$|Pennate muscles, {{in which}} the muscle fibers are {{oriented}} {{at an angle to}} the line of action, typically have two aponeuroses. Muscle fibers connect one to the other, and each aponeurosis <b>thins</b> <b>into</b> a tendon which attaches to bone at the origin or insertion site.|$|R
40|$|Coral skeletons record {{historical}} trace metal {{levels in}} the environment, however, the use of coral skeletal records for biomonitoring studies mostly fail to consider the influence of metal regulation by the living components of coral and subsequent incorporation <b>into</b> the <b>skeleton.</b> This study presents Exaiptasia pallida {{as a representative of}} the living components of coral and shows metal partitioning between the tissue and zooxanthellae after chronic exposure to Zn. A strong tendency for preferential accumulation in the zooxanthellae occurred after 32 days exposure and Zn concentrations in tissue and zooxanthellae were 123. 3 ± 0. 7 mg kg− 1 and 294. 9 ± 8. 5 respectively. This study shows zooxanthellae density plays an important role in controlling Zn loading in whole anemones and must be considered when investigating metal uptake and loading in zooxanthellate organisms. Further studies that investigate links between aragonite deposition rates and zooxanthellae density and incorporation pathways of metals <b>into</b> <b>skeleton</b> are warranted...|$|R
5|$|The snail's {{oesophageal}} gland houses symbiotic gammaproteobacteria {{from which}} the snail appears to obtain its nourishment. This species {{is considered to be}} one of the most peculiar deep-sea hydrothermal-vent gastropods, and it is the only known extant animal that incorporates iron sulfide <b>into</b> its <b>skeleton</b> (<b>into</b> both its sclerites and into its shell as an exoskeleton). Its heart is, proportionately speaking, unusually large for any animal: the heart comprises approximately 4% of its body volume.|$|R

50|$|At the crossroads, Hellboy {{is still}} {{chained to the}} thick wooden pole and is confronted by a fully re-animated Vladmir Giurescu on horseback. Hellboy cracks the wooden pole and hits the horse {{on the head with}} it. The horse and Giurescu {{instantly}} turn <b>into</b> <b>skeletons.</b> The Iron Maiden assumes a snake-like form similar to Hecate's. Repeating that he cannot escape his destiny, Ilsa eats him. Hellboy's horns fully re-grow and he sees the Ogdru-Jahad, but he again refuses to help end the world and snaps his horns. He appears back at the crossroads where Kate Corrigan finds him and tells him what happened to the other teams.|$|R
40|$|This paper extends Shapiro's Model Inference System for synthesizing logic {{programs}} from examples of input/output behavior. A new refinement operator for clause generation, {{based upon the}} decomposition of Prolog programs <b>into</b> <b>skeletons,</b> basic Prolog programs with a well-understood control flow, and techniques, standard Prolog programming practices is described. Shapiro's original system is introduced, skeletons and techniques are discussed, and simple examples are provided, to familiarize the reader with the necessary terminology. The Model Inference System equipped with this new refinement operator is compared and contrasted with the original version presented by Shapiro. The {{strengths and weaknesses of}} applying skeletons and techniques to synthesizing Prolog programs is discussed. ...|$|R
50|$|This {{journey is}} a {{difficult}} one because of the difficult terrain it goes through. During the journey, one passes by a Lake known as Roopkund surrounded by hundreds of ancient skeletons. According to local mythology, once a King took some dancers to this sacred spot. Due to heavy snowfall, the people were trapped and the dancers were transformed <b>into</b> <b>skeletons</b> and stones {{that can be seen}} in Patarnachonia. Another myth is this that king Yasodhwal's wife was pregnant and while she was giving birth to her child, her placenta flowed down to Roopkund and this in turn caused the death of the people there.|$|R
50|$|Zardoz {{ends in a}} wordless {{sequence}} of images accompanied by the sombre second movement (allegretto) of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony, snatches of which are heard throughout the film. Consuella, having {{fallen in love with}} Zed, gives birth to a baby boy within the remains of the giant stone head. In matching green suits, they sit with the boy standing between them, who matures as they age in a series of fades. The youth leaves his parents, who take hands and grow very old, eventually decomposing <b>into</b> <b>skeletons</b> and finally vanishing. Nothing remains in the space but painted hand-prints on the wall and Zed's Webley-Fosbery revolver.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{computerization}} {{of mathematical}} texts {{is often a}} te-dious and manual task. The MathLang System was developed {{to carry out this}} process in gradual steps. The idea is that the user can anno-tate an existing mathematical text with different types of information (grammatical/logical/rhetorical/etc.) and MathLang generates different computerised versions of this text which accommodate different levels of formality. So far there are paths from MathLang <b>into</b> <b>skeletons</b> for the Mizar and Isabelle proof checkers. In this paper we add new rea-soning methods to MathLang’s Document Rhetorical aspect (DRa) and develop a new path from an annotated text <b>into</b> a proof <b>skeleton</b> for the Coq proof assistant. We test and evaluate our new approach {{with the help of the}} first chapter of Landau’s “Grundlagen der Analysis”. 1 Background and motivation MathLang is intended to support different degrees of formalisation and aims to make easier the partial or full formalisation of mathematical texts in some foun...|$|R
5000|$|Talyn is {{a fierce}} warrior, a gracious princess, a caring soul and an unwavering {{defender of the}} righteous. She somehow manages to combine all her devotion to the fight against evil with great compassion. After the {{struggle}} which shattered the Lightstar Crystal, she was granted the power of flight and managed to reconcile Justin and Joshua. Her later exploits include {{finding a way to}} actually restore skeleton warriors to the flesh - by removing the [...] "heart gems" [...] that appear after the transformation. Although this discovery is a tactical advantage and a source of hope, it also spurred Baron Dark on to worse acts; if any skeleton warrior is restored to human form, he could use his power to transform them back <b>into</b> <b>skeletons,</b> but, since {{he was the only one}} who possessed this power, if he himself was restored, no one else would be able to transform him back <b>into</b> a living <b>skeleton.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A man {{enters his}} [...] "cavern", {{and uses a}} human {{skeleton}} to do magic tricks. He first turns the <b>skeleton</b> <b>into</b> a scantilly-clad woman carrying a shield. He then transforms her into a well-dressed lady, whom he makes levitate. The magician proceeds to turn the woman back <b>into</b> a <b>skeleton,</b> and make the body dance. He dances with the skeleton, then takes him off screen. He then uses magic to move a table around the room, then levitates a stool, resting it upon the table.|$|R

25|$|Based on the {{pubic hair}} that Christie {{collected}} from his victims, {{it has been}} speculated that {{he was responsible for}} more murders than those carried out at 10Rillington Place. Christie claimed that the four different clumps of hair in his collection came from his wife and the three bodies discovered in the kitchen alcove, but only one matched the hair type on those bodies, Ethel Christie's. Even if two of the others had come from the bodies of Fuerst and Eady, which had by then decomposed <b>into</b> <b>skeletons,</b> there was still one remaining clump of hair unaccounted for—it could not have come from Beryl Evans, as no pubic hair had been removed from her body.|$|R
60|$|Some one {{was always}} {{starting}} a cheer or a college song, {{and it was}} always <b>thinning</b> <b>into</b> silence. Despite their resolution to be democratic they divided into two sets: the men with dress-clothes and the men without. Babbitt (extremely in dress-clothes) went from one group to the other. Though he was, almost frankly, out for social conquest, he sought Paul Riesling first. He found him alone, neat and silent.|$|R

At a table he sat and consumed beefsteak, flapjacks, doughnuts and pie. And then to the waiter be betrayed the fact that the minutest coin and himself were strangers.|$|R
