5|$|An early medieval wall {{stands to}} the west of <b>the</b> <b>Arch</b> <b>of</b> Caracalla; it was built {{after the end of the}} Roman occupation, {{apparently}} some time in the 5th or 6th centuries, to protect the eastern side of the city's new residential area. It was oriented in a north-south direction and was constructed using stone looted from ruined buildings elsewhere in the abandoned areas of the city.|$|E

5|$|Examples of Roman {{sculpture}} survive abundantly, {{though often}} in damaged or fragmentary condition, including freestanding statues and statuettes in marble, bronze and terracotta, and reliefs from public buildings, temples, and monuments {{such as the}} Ara Pacis, Trajan's Column, and <b>the</b> <b>Arch</b> <b>of</b> Titus. Niches in amphitheatres such as the Colosseum were originally filled with statues, and no formal garden was complete without statuary.|$|E
5|$|In {{each corner}} of the chapel is a {{triangular}} pendentive filling {{the space between the}} walls and <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> <b>of</b> the vault and forming the spandrel above the windows nearest the corners. On these curving shapes Michelangelo has painted four scenes from Biblical stories that are associated with the salvation of Israel by four great male and female heroes of the Jews: Moses, Esther, David and Judith.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} is poorly understood and {{is thought to}} likely have several contributing factors. The plantar fascia is a thick fibrous band of connective tissue that originates from the medial tubercle and anterior aspect of the heel bone. From there, the fascia extends along the {{sole of the foot}} before inserting {{at the base of the}} toes, and supports <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> <b>of</b> the foot.|$|E

The course twice passed Piazza di Porta Capena, where the Obelisk of Axum was then located. When the runners passed the Obelisk the first time Abebe Bikila was at the rear of the lead pack, which included, among others, Rhadi Ben Abdesselam of Morocco.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} building Domitian restored was the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill, {{said to have}} been covered with a gilded roof. Among those completed were the Temple of Vespasian and Titus, <b>the</b> <b>Arch</b> <b>of</b> Titus and the Colosseum, to which he added a fourth level and finished the interior seating area.|$|E
5|$|To {{celebrate}} his {{victory at the}} Battle of Actium, <b>the</b> <b>Arch</b> <b>of</b> Augustus was built in 29BC near {{the entrance of the}} Temple of Castor and Pollux, and widened in 19BC to include a triple-arch design. There are also many buildings outside of the city of Rome that bear Augustus' name and legacy, such as the Theatre of Mérida in modern Spain, the Maison Carrée built at Nîmes in today's southern France, as well as the Trophy of Augustus at La Turbie, located near Monaco.|$|E

5|$|To {{foster the}} worship of the {{imperial}} family, he erected a dynastic mausoleum {{on the site of}} Vespasian's former house on the Quirinal, and completed the Temple of Vespasian and Titus, a shrine dedicated to {{the worship of}} his deified father and brother. To memorialize the military triumphs of the Flavian family, he ordered the construction of the Templum Divorum and the Templum Fortuna Redux, and completed <b>the</b> <b>Arch</b> <b>of</b> Titus.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} legal status as {{citizens}} {{and the degree to}} which they could become emancipated, women could own property, enter contracts, and engage in business, including shipping, manufacturing, and lending money. Inscriptions throughout the Empire honour women as benefactors in funding public works, an indication they could acquire and dispose of considerable fortunes; for instance, <b>the</b> <b>Arch</b> <b>of</b> the Sergii was funded by Salvia Postuma, a female member of the family honoured, and the largest building in the forum at Pompeii was funded by Eumachia, a priestess of Venus.|$|E
5|$|Stone bridge {{construction}} {{started with the}} excavation of foundations for the abutments. Then a temporary structure known as a center or centering would be built of wood or iron. This structure supported the stone arch during construction. Once the stone arch was built, the spandrel walls and wing walls could be added. Then the road bed was built, with fill (loose stones or dirt) added to support it as needed. Wall and arch stones were generally set in place dry to ensure a good fit, then set in mortar. Once the bridge was complete and the mortar had properly hardened, the center was gradually lowered and then removed. In March 1996, after standing for between 156 and 121 years, <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> <b>of</b> Bridge No. 3 finally collapsed.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Arch</b> <b>of</b> Caracalla {{is one of}} Volubilis' most {{distinctive}} sights, situated {{at the end of}} the city's main street, the Decumanus Maximus. Although it is not architecturally outstanding, the triumphal arch forms a striking visual contrast with the smaller Tingis Gate at the far end of the decumanus. It was built in 217 by the city's governor, Marcus Aurelius Sebastenus, to honour the emperor Caracalla and his mother Julia Domna. Caracalla was himself a North African and had recently extended Roman citizenship to the inhabitants of Rome's provinces. However, by the time the arch was finished both Caracalla and Julia had been murdered by a usurper.|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} {{supplied}} with water by an aqueduct that ran from a {{spring in the}} hills behind the city. The aqueduct may have been constructed around 60–80AD and was subsequently reconstructed on several occasions. An elaborate network of channels fed houses and the public baths from the municipal supply {{and a series of}} drains carried sewage and waste away to the river to be flushed. The aqueduct ran under the Decumanus Secundus, a street that ran parallel with the Decumanus Maximus, and terminated at a large fountain in the city centre near <b>the</b> <b>Arch</b> <b>of</b> Caracalla.|$|E
5|$|The epitomes of Aurelius Victor (De Caesaribus), Eutropius (Breviarium), Festus (Breviarium), and the {{anonymous}} {{author of the}} Epitome de Caesaribus offer compressed secular political and military histories of the period. Although not Christian, the epitomes paint a favorable image of Constantine, but omit reference to Constantine's religious policies. The Panegyrici Latini, a collection of panegyrics from the late third and early fourth centuries, provide valuable information on the politics and ideology of the tetrarchic period and the early life of Constantine. Contemporary architecture, such as <b>the</b> <b>Arch</b> <b>of</b> Constantine in Rome and palaces in Gamzigrad and Córdoba, epigraphic remains, and the coinage of the era complement the literary sources.|$|E

5|$|After {{consulting}} with his family, Tiberius made his wishes known whereupon the Senate collected the honors into a commemorative decree, the Senatus Consultum de memoria honoranda Germanini Caesaris, {{and ordered the}} consuls of AD 20 to issue a public law honoring the death of Germanicus, the Lex Valeria Aurelia. Although Tacitus stressed the honors paid to him, the funeral and processions were carefully modeled after those of Gaius and Lucius, Agrippa's sons. This served to emphasize {{the continuation of the}} domus Augusta across the transition from Augustus to Tiberius. Commemorative arches were built in his honor and not just at Rome, but at the frontier on the Rhine and in Asia where he had governed in life. <b>The</b> <b>arch</b> <b>of</b> the Rhine was placed alongside of that of his father, where the soldiers had built a funerary monument honoring him. Portraits of him and his natural father were placed in the Temple of Apollo on the Palatine in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Although List {{wanted to}} become an artist and scholar, he reluctantly agreed to his father's insistence that he enter the family's leather goods business. During his leisure time he devoted himself to writing and {{sketching}} as well as rambling, riding, or rowing in the countryside, becoming both {{a member of the}} Viennese rowing club Donauhort and the secretary of the Austrian Alpine Association (Österreichischer Alpenverein). He was involved in both solitary and group expeditions into the Austrian Alps, and it was on one of the latter journeys that he left his mountaineering group to spend Midsummer night alone atop the Geiselberg hillfort. On 24 June 1875 he and four friends rowed down the Danube before camping for the night {{at the site of the}} ancient Roman fortification of Carnuntum to commemorate the 1500th anniversary of the Battle of Carnuntum, in which Germanic tribes defeated the Roman Army. List later claimed that while his friends caroused, he celebrated the event with a fire and by burying eight bottles of wine in the shape of a swastika beneath <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> <b>of</b> the monument's Pagan Gate.|$|E
5|$|It {{became known}} on 4 September 2015 that ISIL had {{destroyed}} {{three of the}} best preserved tower tombs including the Tower of Elahbel. On 5 October 2015, news media reported ISIL is destroying buildings with no religious meaning, including <b>the</b> <b>Arch</b> <b>of</b> Triumph. On 20 January 2017, news emerged that the militants destroyed the tetrapylon {{and part of the}} theater. Following the March 2017 capture of Palmyra by the Syrian Army, Maamoun Abdulkarim, director of antiquities and museums at the Syrian Ministry of Culture, stated that the damage to ancient monuments may be lesser than earlier believed and preliminary pictures showed almost no further damage than what was already known. Antiquities official Wael Hafyan stated that the Tetrapylon was badly damaged while the damage to the facade of the Roman theatre was less serious in relativity.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>arches</b> <b>of</b> {{decorative}} wall arcades {{and galleries}} are sometimes cusped. Circles with trefoils, quatrefoils, etc., are {{introduced into the}} tracery of galleries and large rose windows in the transept or nave, as at Lincoln Cathedral (1220). The conventional foliage decorating the capitals is of great beauty and variety, and extends to spandrels, roof bosses, etc. In <b>the</b> spandrels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nave, transept or choir arcades, diaper work is occasionally found, as in the transept of Westminster Abbey, {{which is one of}} the best examples of the period.|$|R
