5|$|Along {{with the}} rest of {{south-west}} England, the Blackdown Hills have a temperate climate that is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The mean temperature is approximately 10°C (50°F) and shows a seasonal and a diurnal variation, but because of the modifying effect of the sea the range is less <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> other parts of the United Kingdom (UK). January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1°C (34°F) and 2°C (36°F). July and August are the warmest months, with mean daily maxima around 21°C (70°F). December is normally the most cloudy month and June the sunniest. High pressure over the Azores often brings clear skies to south-west England, particularly in summer.|$|E
5|$|Buses are an {{important}} part of the Northern transport mix, with bus ridership above the England and Wales average in all three Northern regions. Many of the municipal bus companies were located in Northern England, and the region saw intense competition and bus wars following deregulation in the 1980s and 1990s. Increasing car ownership in the same era caused bus use to decline, although it remains higher <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> areas of the South.|$|E

5|$|Koster sees {{effects of}} realism, {{especially}} the idealistic realism {{held at the}} time in the Netherlands, in the work. He notes that motives and causality are given more weight in the narrative <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> contemporary works. He observes that this is also reflected in the characters, who– although royalty and holy men– were given the traits of persons one could find in real-life Batavia (now Jakarta). The use of punctuation, another trait uncommon in the local literature of the time, may also have served to give a more realistic reading and reflected the work's origin as a written manuscript and not from oral literature. Tio Ie Soei described the work's rhythm as more akin to speech than song.|$|E
5|$|Rotaviral {{enteritis}} is a mild {{to severe}} disease characterised by nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhoea and low-grade fever. Once {{a child is}} infected by the virus, there is an incubation period of about two days before symptoms appear. The period of illness is acute. Symptoms often start with vomiting followed by four to eight days of profuse diarrhoea. Dehydration {{is more common in}} rotavirus infection <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> of those caused by bacterial pathogens, and is {{the most common cause of}} death related to rotavirus infection.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} de-Stalinization in Czechoslovakia had begun under Antonín Novotný {{in the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, but had progressed more slowly <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> other states of the Eastern Bloc. Following the lead of Nikita Khrushchev, Novotný proclaimed the {{completion}} of socialism, and the new constitution, accordingly, adopted the name Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. The pace of change, however, was sluggish; the rehabilitation of Stalinist-era victims, such as those convicted in the Slánský trials, may have been considered as early as 1963, but {{did not take place}} until 1967.|$|E

Benzoyl peroxide has been used since 1934 to kill Propionibacterium acnes, the bacterium that causes acne. Several over-the-counter acne treatments contain it, including Clean & Clear, Clearasil, Doctor's Dermatologic Formula, Neutrogena Advanced Systems, PanOxyl and Stridex.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{prevailing}} Soviet ideology stressed gender equality in labor and education, and many Soviet women held jobs and advanced degrees, {{they did not}} participate in core political roles and institutions. Above the middle levels, political and economic leaders were overwhelmingly male. While propaganda claimed, accurately, that more women sat in the Supreme Soviet <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> democratic countries' legislative bodies combined, only two women, Yekaterina Furtseva and (in its last year of existence) Galina Semyonova, were ever members of the party's Politburo, in practice the country's real leadership.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} rest of South West England, Frome has a {{temperate}} climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is about 10°C (50°F) with seasonal and diurnal variations, but due to the modifying effect of the sea, the range is less <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> other parts of the United Kingdom. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1°C (34°F) and 2°C (36°F). July and August are the warmest months in the region with mean daily maxima around 21°C (70°F). In general, December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The south west of England enjoys a favoured location, particularly in summer, when the Azores High extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK.|$|E

5|$|Details on {{the retreat}} of Siberian and Russian Far East glaciers less {{adequate}} <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> other glaciated {{areas of the}} world. There are several reasons for this, the principal one being that {{since the collapse of}} Communism there has been a large {{reduction in the number of}} monitoring stations. Another factor is that in the Verkhoyansk and Cherskiy Ranges it was thought glaciers were absent before they were discovered during the 1940s, whilst in ultra-remote Kamchatka and Chukotka, although the existence of glaciers was known earlier, monitoring of their size dates back no earlier than the end of World War II. Nonetheless, available records do indicate a general retreat of all glaciers in the Altai Mountains with the exception of volcanic glaciers in Kamchatka. Sakha’s glaciers, totaling seventy square kilometers, have shrunk by around 28percent since 1945 reaching several percent annually in some places, whilst in the Altai and Chukotkan mountains and non-volcanic areas of Kamchatka, the shrinkage is considerably larger.|$|E
5|$|Females {{typically}} {{lay between}} {{four hundred and}} three thousand eggs. The eggs are often dropped {{onto the surface of}} the water; sometimes the female deposits them by dipping the tip of her abdomen into the water during flight, releasing a small batch of eggs each time, or deposits them in bulk while standing next to the water. In a few species, the female submerges and places the eggs among plants or in crevices underwater, but in general, they sink to the bottom. The incubation time is variable, depending at least in part on temperature, and may be anything from a few days to nearly a year. Eggs can go into a quiet dormant phase or diapause. The larval growth rate is also temperature-dependent, as is the number of moults. At anywhere between ten and fifty, these post-embryonic moults are more numerous in mayflies <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> other insect orders. The nymphal stage of mayflies may last from several months to several years, depending on species and environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{sedentary}} {{habits of}} the bivalves have meant that in general the nervous system is less complex <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> other molluscs. The animals have no brain; the nervous system consists of a nerve network {{and a series of}} paired ganglia. In all but the most primitive bivalves, two cerebropleural ganglia are {{on either side of the}} oesophagus. The cerebral ganglia control the sensory organs, while the pleural ganglia supply nerves to the mantle cavity. The pedal ganglia, which control the foot, are at its base, and the visceral ganglia, which can be quite large in swimming bivalves, are under the posterior adductor muscle. These ganglia are both connected to the cerebropleural ganglia by nerve fibres. Bivalves with long siphons may also have siphonal ganglia to control them.|$|E
50|$|It {{can also}} {{hybridize}} with Betula papyrifera in northern regions where their ranges overlap. It has seldom been reported but {{is thought to}} be more common <b>than</b> realized. <b>In</b> <b>most</b> features it is intermediate between the two parents.|$|R
50|$|The inter-receptor {{angles of}} Portias eyes {{may be as}} small as 2.4 minutes of arc, which is only six times worse <b>than</b> <b>in</b> humans, and is six times better <b>than</b> <b>in</b> the <b>most</b> acute insect eye. It is also clearer <b>in</b> {{daylight}} <b>than</b> a cats vision.|$|R
50|$|In {{females of}} Arizona elegans philipi {{the length of}} the tail is greater than 13.5% of the total body length; <b>in</b> males, greater <b>than</b> 14.5%. <b>In</b> <b>most</b> {{specimens}} the smooth dorsal scales are arranged in 27 rows at midbody.|$|R
5|$|The {{silvertip shark}} is a robust and {{streamlined}} species with a moderately long, broad snout and large, round eyes. The five pairs of gill slits are short. There are 12–14 tooth rows {{on each side}} of both jaws, with one or two small teeth at the symphysis (middle of the jaws). The upper teeth are broad with oblique triangular cusps and coarse serrations near the base; the lower teeth have erect cusps with fine serrations. The first dorsal fin is large and triangular, originating above or slightly forward of the free pectoral fin tips. There is a ridge {{between the first and second}} dorsal fins. The pectoral fins are proportionately longer <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> requiem sharks and falcate (sickle-like) in shape, with pointed tips.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertebral}} column {{was composed of}} nine cervical (neck) vertebrae, 13 dorsal (back) vertebrae, three sacral (hip) vertebrae, and at least 40 caudal (tail) vertebrae. The pubis faced forward, as with most saurischians. It had a slighter build than that of Plateosaurus, an otherwise similar dinosaur. The neck was proportionally longer <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> other plateosaurids, with the foremost cervicals being four times {{the length of the}}ir width. The forelimbs were only half the length of the hindlimbs but quite powerful, as indicated by the broad upper end of the humerus that provided attachment areas for a large arm musculature. Like Plateosaurus, it had five digits on each hand and foot. The hand was short and wide, with a large sickle shaped thumb claw used for feeding or defense against predators. The thumb was the longest finger in the hand, while the fourth and fifth digits were tiny, giving the forepaws a lopsided look.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the teeth}} found with the holotype {{specimen}} were not {{attached to the}} skull; a few remained in the upper jaw, and only small replacement teeth were in the lower jaw. The teeth had the shape of recurved cones, flattened somewhat sideways. The larger teeth were less recurved than the smaller ones, but were otherwise uniform. The roots were very long, and the teeth slender. The carinae (edges) of the teeth were finely serrated with denticles {{on the front and}} back. There were seven narrow, uniform denticles per millimetre (0.039in), more <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> theropods. Some of the teeth were fluted, with six to eight ridges along the length of their inner sides and fine-grained enamel. The inner side of each tooth row had a bony wall. The number of teeth was large, with seven teeth in the right premaxilla (other theropods have three to five) and thirty-two in the dentary, where sixteen is typical. The lower jaw would have had sixty-four teeth, and the difference between the number of teeth in the upper and lower jaws is more pronounced than in other theropods. The teeth in the dentary were more densely packed than those in the maxilla, and probably smaller. The terminal rosette in the upper jaw had thirteen dental alveoli (tooth sockets), six on the left and seven on the right side; the first four were large (with the second and third the largest), while the fourth and fifth progressively decreased in size. The diameter of the largest was twice that of the smallest. The first four alveoli of the dentary (corresponding to the tip of the upper jaw) were the largest, with the rest more regular in size. Interdental plates were between the alveoli.|$|E

5|$|The molars are {{slightly}} more high-crowned (hypsodont) <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> oryzomyines, {{and many of}} the accessory crests are reduced, but they are sharply distinct from the highly derived, hypsodont molars of Holochilus. The main cusps are located opposite each other and have rounded edges. The enamel folds do not extend past the midlines of the molars. The mesoloph, an accessory crest on the upper molars that is usually well-developed in oryzomyines, is present but short on the first and second upper molar; it is much more reduced in Holochilus and Pseudoryzomys. The corresponding structure on the lower molars, the mesolophid, is present on the first and second molars in Lundomys, but absent in both Holochilus and Pseudoryzomys. Another accessory crest, the anteroloph, is present, though small, on the first upper molar in Lundomys, but entirely absent in both other genera. As in Holochilus and Pseudoryzomys, the anterior cusp on the first lower molar, the anteroconid, contains a deep pit. Each of the three upper molars has three roots; unlike in both Holochilus and Pseudoryzomys, the first upper molar lacks an accessory fourth root. The first lower molar has four roots, including two small accessory roots located between larger anterior and posterior roots. The second molar has either two or three roots, with the anterior root split into two smaller roots in some specimens.|$|E
