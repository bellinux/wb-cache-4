5|$|Much of what {{is known}} of Allen's captivity is known only from his own account of the time; where {{contemporary}} records are available, <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to confirm those aspects of his story.|$|E
5|$|Securely {{attached}} adults tend to {{have positive}} views of themselves, their partners and their relationships. They feel comfortable with intimacy and independence, balancing the two. Anxious-preoccupied adults seek high levels of intimacy, approval and responsiveness from partners, becoming overly dependent. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> to be less trusting, have less positive views about themselves and their partners, and may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, worry and impulsiveness in their relationships. Dismissive-avoidant adults desire {{a high level of}} independence, often appearing to avoid attachment altogether. They view themselves as self-sufficient, invulnerable to attachment feelings and not needing close relationships. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> to suppress their feelings, dealing with rejection by distancing themselves from partners of whom they often have a poor opinion. Fearful-avoidant adults have mixed feelings about close relationships, both desiring and feeling uncomfortable with emotional closeness. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> to mistrust their partners and view themselves as unworthy. Like dismissive-avoidant adults, fearful-avoidant adults tend to seek less intimacy, suppressing their feelings.|$|E
5|$|Within {{parallel}} computing, {{there are}} specialized parallel devices that remain niche areas of interest. While not domain-specific, <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> {{to be applicable}} to only a few classes of parallel problems.|$|E
30|$|To {{test whether}} the search style {{adopted by the}} dyad {{influenced}} accuracy, the dyads were then split into two groups: (1) dyads with a split search ratio higher than 0, meaning <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> to search independently (n[*]=[*] 5); and (2) dyads with a split search ratio lower than 0, meaning <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> to split search between them (n[*]=[*] 12).|$|R

5|$|A {{stationary}} front is a non-moving (or stalled) boundary between two air masses, {{neither of which}} {{is strong enough to}} replace the other. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> to remain essentially in the same area for extended periods of time, usually moving in waves. There is normally a broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherm packing.|$|E
5|$|Charismatics {{trace their}} {{historical}} origins to the charismatic {{movement of the}} 1960s and 1970s. They are distinguished from Pentecostals because <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to allow for differing viewpoints on whether Spirit baptism is subsequent to conversion and whether tongues is always a sign of receiving the baptism.|$|E
5|$|Despite being bred for racing, Whippets can be couch potatoes. When {{not running}} around, {{they are usually}} asleep or cuddled in their owner's lap. They are not prone to {{fighting}} but {{have been known to}} chase small pets, due to their sighthound nature. They also have a tendency to get up on furniture. Whippets are touch sensitive, meaning that <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to jump or overreact when touched unexpectedly.|$|E
25|$|However, early MEMS {{resonators}} did {{not have}} sufficiently stable frequencies {{to be used for}} timing references or clock generation. The metallic resonator elements tended to shift frequency with time (they aged) and with use (they fatigued). Under temperature variation <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> to have large and not entirely predicable frequency shifts (they had large temperature sensitivity) and when they were temperature cycled <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> to return to different frequencies (they were hysteretic).|$|R

5|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} produce significant, although usually mild, {{side effects}} including drowsiness, hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation. Sometimes side effects appear {{even at a}} minimal clinically effective dose, leading the physician {{to search for a}} different drug. Agonists have been related to impulse control disorders (such as compulsive sexual activity, eating, gambling and shopping) even more strongly than levodopa. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> to be more expensive than levodopa.|$|E
5|$|I don't {{see much}} {{difference}} between a communist regime and a fascist regime. In fact, I {{think one of the}} greatest intellectual confusions that many have had over these decades is the whole right and left thing -- fascists are on the right, communists are on the left. Nonsense! They come together and overlap, and we're seeing this in Russia today where the allies are the nationalistic chauvinists and the communists. They are natural allies because they are authoritarians by nature. And more than authoritarians, <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to be totalitarians, which means that <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to destroy all of the elements of the civil society. To me that's much more important than whether you're philosophically right or left. You know, are you willing to create and live in a civil society, in an open society, or not? That to me is the basic issue.|$|E
5|$|Individual sharks choose sites {{giving them}} the best ambush success. They prefer {{junctions}} of sandy and rocky substrates near reefs (used by many fishes for shelter) usually orienting themselves either toward or parallel to nearby vertical structures. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> to face upslope, which may facilitate burying via falling sediment, bring more fish swimming downstream from the reef, or ease targeting by silhouetting prey against the sunlight.|$|E

5|$|Juveniles {{begin to}} court {{at a very}} early age, but may not bond for another two or three years. Aerial acrobatics, demonstrations of intelligence, and ability to provide food are key {{behaviors}} of courting. Once paired, <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to nest together for life, usually in the same location. Instances of non-monogamy have been observed in common ravens, by males visiting a female's nest when her mate is away.|$|E
5|$|Mars has {{the largest}} dust storms in the Solar System. These can vary from a storm over a small area, to {{gigantic}} storms that cover the entire planet. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> to occur when Mars is closest to the Sun, and {{have been shown to}} increase the global temperature.|$|E
5|$|Saltwater fish tend to lose water {{because of}} osmosis. Their kidneys return {{water to the}} body. The reverse happens in {{freshwater}} fish: <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to gain water osmotically. Their kidneys produce dilute urine for excretion. Some fish have specially adapted kidneys that vary in function, allowing them to move from freshwater to saltwater.|$|E

50|$|Due {{to their}} {{geographic}} concentration, {{it is noted that}} <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> {{to be isolated}} and had an insular culture. As a result, <b>they</b> also <b>tended</b> to be very late in their adoption of the English language and of western culture in general. The insular culture and resultant intermarriage can result in a high degree of consanguinity amongst Vathimas.|$|R
25|$|By contrast, the Seminole welcomed {{into their}} nation African Americans who had escaped slavery (Black Seminoles). <b>They</b> <b>tended</b> to live {{alongside}} each other, rather than joining their cultures.|$|R
5|$|Scotties, {{while being}} {{described}} as very loving, {{have also been}} described as stubborn. They are sometimes described as an aloof breed, {{although it has been}} noted that <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to be very loyal to their family and are known to attach themselves to one or two people.|$|E
5|$|Species in {{this order}} have {{distinctive}} pedicellariae, {{consisting of a}} short stalk with three skeletal ossicles. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> to have robust bodies and have tube feet with flat-tipped suckers usually arranged in four rows. The order includes well-known species from temperate regions, including the common starfish of North Atlantic coasts and rock pools, as well as cold-water and abyssal species.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} are {{not common}} over Arizona, but on average, {{a tropical storm}} or a tropical depression enters the state approximately every five years. However, indirect flash floods caused by the remnants of tropical cyclones are more common, as <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to occur about every two years.|$|E
5000|$|These kings were Arians (followers of the {{theological}} teaching of Arius). <b>They</b> <b>tended</b> to succeed their fathers or close relatives {{on the throne}} and thus constitute a dynasty.|$|R

5|$|Bee-eaters may be infested {{by several}} blood-feeding flies {{of the genus}} Carnus, and the biting fly Ornithophila metallica. Other parasites include chewing lice of the genera Meromenopon, Brueeliaa and Meropoecus, {{some of which are}} {{specialist}} parasites of bee-eaters, and the stickfast flea Echidnophaga gallinacea. The hole-nesting lifestyle of bee-eaters means that <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to carry a higher burden of external parasites than non-hole-nesting bird species. Bee-eaters may also be infected by protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus including H. meropis.|$|E
5|$|Coloured {{gold and}} green, the frogs are {{voracious}} eaters of insects, {{but will also}} eat larger prey, such as worms and mice. Unlike most frogs, they are active at day, although this is mostly to warm in the sun. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> to be less active in winter except in warmer or wetter periods, and breed in the warmer months. Males reach maturity after around 9 months, while for the larger females, this does not occur until they are two years old. The frogs can engage in cannibalism, and males frequently attack and injure one another if they infringe on one another's space.|$|E
5|$|European nightjars hunt by sight, silhouetting {{their prey}} against the night sky. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> to flycatch from a perch on moonlit nights, but fly {{continuously}} on darker nights when prey {{is harder to}} see. Hunting frequency reduces {{in the middle of}} the night. Although they have very small bills, the mouth can be opened very wide as they catch insects. They have long sensitive bristles around the mouth, which may help to locate or funnel prey into the mouth. Indigestible parts of insects, such as the chitin exoskeleton, are regurgitated as pellets.|$|E
50|$|Irish Catholic unionists were a {{political}} minority group without their own {{representation in the}} House of Commons. <b>They</b> <b>tended</b> to support the Irish Loyal and Patriotic Union and subsequent Irish Unionist Alliance.|$|R
