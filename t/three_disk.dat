40|$|We {{examined}} how subjects plan movement sequences in a 'foraging' task involving <b>three</b> <b>disks</b> that appeared simultaneously {{at a small}} number of possible locations on a touch-screen monitor. Subjects received monetary rewards for the disks they touched within 1. 6 s. Disk colour signaled the value. The subjects could choose to attempt <b>three</b> <b>disks</b> in any order and could choose to attempt fewer than <b>three</b> <b>disks.</b> The dependent variable was the estimated probability of hitting each disk (pA, pB, pC) as a function of sequence. It might be (0. 9, 0. 6, 0. 5) for sequence ABC but (0. 9, 0, 0. 9) for sequence AC (no attempt to hit B). The sequence ABC offers the higher probability of hitting all <b>three</b> <b>disks</b> but, if A and C are made valuable enough, the sequence AC has higher expected gain. We tested whether subjects planned movement sequences that maximised expected gain. The experiment consisted of three sessions. In the first session, ten naive subjects were trained until their performance was stable. In the second session, we measured how accurately each subject could execute each of the 12 possible sequences of length 2 or 3 on <b>three</b> <b>disks</b> of equal value. In the last session, the values of the disks were altered by amounts that varied between blocks of trials. Subjects were told the values of the colour-coded disks before each block and were free to choose any sequence. On the basis of second-session performance we could predict the strategy each subject should adopt on each trial in order to maximise expected value for each assignment of values to disks. Subjects did change strategies in the expected direction but typically favoured strategies that maximised probability of hitting <b>three</b> <b>disks</b> over the maximum expected gain strateg...|$|R

40|$|The leitmotif of {{this work}} can be {{described}} in quite a simple manner: Given three distinct points in the plane, one needs at most <b>three</b> <b>disks</b> of arbitrary radius to cover them.

Obviously, many more than <b>three</b> <b>disks</b> are necessary to cover the whole figure, and their number increases as their radii decrease. The triangle is the convex hull of its vertices.

5000|$|The Minuteman-I Autonetics D-17 flight {{computer}} used a rotating air bearing magnetic disk holding 2,560 [...] "cold-stored" [...] words in 20 tracks (write heads disabled after program fill) of 24 bits each and one alterable track of 128 words. The {{time for a}} D-17 disk revolution was 10 ms. The D-17 also used a number of short loops for faster access of intermediate results storage. The D-17 computational minor cycle was <b>three</b> <b>disk</b> revolutions or 30 ms. During that time all recurring computations were performed. For ground operations the inertial platform was aligned and gyro correction rates updated. During flight, filtered command outputs were sent by each minor cycle to the engine nozzles. Unlike modern computers, which use descendants of that technology for secondary storage on hard disk, the disk was the active computer memory. The disk storage was considered hardened to radiation from nearby nuclear explosions, making it an ideal storage medium. To improve computational speed, the D-17 borrowed an instruction look-ahead feature from the Autonetics-built Field Artillery Data Computer (M18 FADAC) that permitted simple instruction execution every word time.|$|E

40|$|We present ALMA {{continuum}} and {{spectral line}} data at 0. 89 mm and 3. 2 mm for <b>three</b> <b>disks</b> surrounding young brown dwarfs and very low mass {{stars in the}} Taurus star forming region. Dust thermal emission is detected and spatially resolved for all the <b>three</b> <b>disks,</b> while CO(J= 3 - 2) emission is seen in two disks. We analyze the continuum visibilities and constrain the disks physical structure in dust. The results of our analysis show that the disks are relatively large, the smallest one with an outer radius of about 70 AU. The inferred disk radii, radial profiles of the dust surface density and disk to central object mass ratios lie within the ranges found for disks around more massive young stars. We derive from our observations the wavelength dependence of the millimeter dust opacity. In all the <b>three</b> <b>disks</b> data {{are consistent with the}} presence of grains with at least millimeter sizes, as also found for disks around young stars, and confirm that {{the early stages of the}} solid growth toward planetesimals occur also around very low mass objects. We discuss the implications of our findings on models of solids evolution in protoplanetary disks, on the main mechanisms proposed for the formation of brown dwarfs and very low mass stars, as well as on the potential of finding rocky and giant planets around very low mass objects.
