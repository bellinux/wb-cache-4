50|$|Initially, the Rad Lab {{built an}} {{experimental}} breadboard set with a 10 cm {{transmitter and receiver}} using separate antennas (the <b>T-R</b> <b>switch</b> was not yet available). This was successfully tested in February 1941, detecting an aircraft at a range of 4 miles.|$|E
50|$|When {{the cavity}} {{magnetron}} was first developed, {{its use in}} microwave RDF sets was held up because the duplexers for VHF were destroyed by the new higher-powered transmitter. This problem was solved in early 1941 by the <b>T-R</b> <b>switch</b> developed at the Clarendon Laboratory of Oxford University, allowing a pulse transmitter and receiver to share the same antenna without affecting the receiver.|$|E
50|$|When {{the cavity}} {{magnetron}} became practicable, the ADEE co-operated with TRE in utilising {{it in an}} experimental 20 cm GL set. This was first tested and found to be too fragile for army field use. When the ADEE became the ADRDE in early 1941, this organization started {{the development of the}} GL3B. All of the equipment, including the power generator, was contained in a protected trailer, topped with two 6-foot dish transmitting and receiving antennas on a rotating base, as the transmit-receive (<b>T-R)</b> <b>switch</b> allowing a single antenna to perform both functions had not yet been perfected. Similar microwave gun laying systems were being developed in Canada (the GL3C) and in America (eventually designated SCR-584). Although about 400 of the GL3B sets were manufactured, it was the American version that was most numerous in the defense of London during the V-1 attacks.|$|E
50|$|The {{combination}} of magnetron, transmit-receive (<b>T-R)</b> <b>switch,</b> small antenna and high resolution allowed small, powerful radars {{to be installed}} in aircraft. Maritime patrol aircraft could detect objects as small as submarine periscopes, allowing aircraft to track and attack submerged submarines, where before only surfaced submarines could be detected. In addition, radar could detect the submarine at a much greater range than visual observation, both in the daylight and at night, when submarines had previously considered themselves safe to surface and recharge their batteries. Centimetric contour mapping radars like H2S, and the even higher frequency American-created H2X, allowed new tactics in the strategic bombing campaign. Centimetric gun-laying radars were much more accurate than the older technology. Allied naval gunnery improved and, along with the proximity fuze, radar made anti-aircraft guns much more effective. The two new systems used by anti-aircraft batteries are credited with destroying many V-1 flying bombs {{in the late summer}} of 1944.|$|E
50|$|A major {{features}} of the radar was its maximum unambiguous range of 32768 nmi km despite a pulse repetition frequency PRFof some hundreds of pulses per second.To combine these two features requires that the radar carry out nth time around tracking, that is, {{it had to be}} able to track an echo resulting from a transmitted pulse other than that sent as the start of the same PRF period in which the echo was received.In order to do so the range system employed a 2-second time base which allowed the system to determine the number of PRF periods elapsing before an echo, resulting from a particular transmit (Tx) pulse was received. The range system carried out a find process, then a verify process before entering the auto-tracking mode. All the following discussion uses ranges in yards—the radar was designed to work in those units and converting them to metric units would not add any clarity to this description.The FIND process is first carried out. In this process two successive Tx trigger pulses are delayed by a time equivalent to an RF wave go and return distance of 16,000 yd. Then the range gate triggers are delayed by an equivalent time. The delayed Tx trigger pulses are counted in an auxiliary counter, the zone counter, until target video pulses are detected in the delayed range gates. At this point the zone counter contains the number of PRF periods corresponding to the nth time around.The VERIFY process is then entered. In this mode one Tx pulse is delayed for a 16,000 yd equivalent distance. The range gate in the zone determined in the FIND mode is also delayed to match the TX delay. This sequence is repeated until four video returns, from eight attempts, are received. When the four returns are detected automatic tracking is maintained. The contents of the zone counter are added to the apparent range, that is the range reported in the current PRF period, to determine the actual range of the target.If, during the Verify process four returns are not found after eight tries the Find process is re-initiated.Take this example, in which a PRF of 142 PPS is assumed: A target at a range of 4,883,072 yd is to be acquired.At the radar console the operator initiates the FIND mode, and the system carries out that process by delaying triggers, counting zones etc., as described above, and finds that the zone counter has stored a count of four. The VERIFY mode then takes place, resulting in confirmation of the zone count. The target will appear, on the radar display to be at a range of 265,200 yd, that is the difference between, in this case, four PRF period equivalents, plus the additional range. The range reported will be the actual target range of 4,883,072 yd, the figure displayed on the range read-out. As the radar was designed to track moving objects the need arose to handle targets which, in closing or opening range, during nth time around tracking, came into coincidence with the next Tx pulse.So, in the jargon, the radar had to be capable of tracking “through the Big Bang.” This arises from the fact that the antenna serves both the Tx and Rx. To allow this to happen a device called the Transmit-Receive Switch Switchis used. The antenna is connected to the Rx until the Tx is pulsed. The <b>T-R</b> <b>Switch</b> detects the Tx pulse and transfers the antenna to the Tx for the duration of the pulse, say, 1 microsecond. period is that in which a radio wave would travel 164 yd. Remember we are talking here of radar ranges, the total go and return distance.At the instant the Rx is disconnected from the antenna the range system will lose track.In order for an Nth time around tracking system to work there has to be some arrangement to cover the loss of Rx signal for the Tx pulse period.In the radar under discussion this is achieved as follows. When the target pulse reaches an apparent range of ±16,000 yd of the Tx pulse a number of Tx pulse, the number being the zone count, are delayed by a time equivalent to 32,000 yd. Take our example above. When the range of the target reduces to 4,633,872 yd-that is 16,000 yd greater than the 4 zones, the 32,000 yd delay is introduced into the Tx system. After 4 pulses the delay is transferred into the range gate generation system, and the target continues to be tracked. After the target has reached a range of 4,601,872 yd, 4 zones minus 16,000 yd, the delay is removed from the system. At that point the range is such that the zone counter will have been decremented by 1 and the apparent range will be 1,138,468 yd, but with the target at a real range of 3 zones plus the apparent range. Obviously, for an opening target the zone counter will be incremented and the apparent range will be slightly more than 16 yd.|$|E
