5|$|Edziza's shield volcanoes {{are built}} {{almost entirely of}} fluid lava flows. They formed {{as a result of}} lava flowing out in all {{directions}} from central summit vents and from groups of vents, building a broad, gently sloping cone of flat, domical shape. They are built up slowly by the accretion of thousands of lava flows of highly fluid basaltic lava, which spread widely over great distances, and then cool as thin, gently dipping sheets. In some shield volcano eruptions, basaltic lava has poured out quietly from fissure vents instead of central vents, flooding <b>the</b> <b>surrounding</b> <b>countryside</b> with lava flow upon lava flow, forming Edziza's broad lava plateau.|$|E
