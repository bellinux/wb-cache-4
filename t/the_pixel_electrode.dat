Systemization of the semi-transparent and semi-reflective anode with the high reflectivity Al cathode could form a micro-cavity structure to improve the efficiency of OLED made on it. The maximum luminance efficiency of the red, green and blue OLEDs with the poly-Si anode is 3. 67 cd/A, 5. 88 cd/A and 1. 88 cd/A, respectively, comparable to or even better {{than that of the}} OLEDs with the ITO anodes. Using the poly-Si anode technique to prepare the pixel micro-electrodes in AMOLED, the micro-anodes of the OLEDs were made by the same poly-Si thin film and with the same process flow as those to made the drain/source of the drive poly-Si TFT.

We have elucidated the physical mechanisms behind the efficiency loss under the bias rail with TCAD simulations. The efficiency loss is due to the interplay of the bias rail acting as a charge collecting electrode with the region of low electric field in the silicon near the surface at the boundary. The region acts as a “shield” for the electrode. After irradiation, the strong applied electric field nearly eliminates the region. The TCAD simulations have shown that wide p-stop and large Si–SiO 2 interface charge (inversion layer, specifically) act to shield the weighting potential. <b>The</b> <b>pixel</b> sensor of <b>the</b> old design irradiated by γ-rays at 2. 4 MGy is confirmed to exhibit only a slight efficiency loss at the boundary...|$|R
40|$|Direct {{conversion}} {{flat panel}} x-ray image sensors based on using a photoconductor with an active matrix array provide excellent images. These image sensors {{are suitable for}} replacing the present day x-ray film/screen cassette to capture an x-ray image electronically, and hence enable a clinical transition to digital radiography. The performance of these sensors depends critically on the selection and design of the photoconductor. This work quantitatively studies the combined effects of <b>the</b> detector geometry (<b>pixel</b> size and detector thickness), operating conditions (x-ray energy and applied electric field) and charge transport properties (e. g., carrier trapping and recombination) of the photoconductor on the detector performance by developing appropriate detector models. In this thesis, the models for calculating the x-ray sensitivity, resolution {{in terms of the}} modulation transfer function (MTF), detective quantum efficiency (DQE), and ghosting of x-ray image detectors have been developed. The modeling works are based on the physics of the individual phenomena and the systematic solution of the fundamental physical equations in the photoconductor layer: (1) semiconductor continuity equation (2) Poisson’s equation (3) trapping rate equations. The general approach of this work is to develop models in normalized coordinates to describe the results of different photoconductive x-ray image detectors. These models are applied to a-Se, polycrystalline HgI_ 2 and polycrystalline CdZnTe photoconductive detectors for diagnostic medical x-ray imaging applications (e,g., mammography, chest radiography and fluoroscopy). The models show a very good agreement with the experimental results. The research presented in this thesis shows that the imaging performances (e. g., sensitivity, MTF, DQE and ghosting) can be improved by insuring that the carrier with higher mobility-lifetime product is drifted towards <b>the</b> <b>pixel</b> <b>electrodes.</b> <b>The</b> carrier schubwegs have to be several times greater, and the absorption depth has to be at least two times smaller than the photoconductor thickness for achieving sufficient sensitivity. Having smaller pixels is advantageous in terms of higher sensitivity by ensuring that the carrier with the higher mobility-lifetime product is drifted towards <b>the</b> <b>pixel</b> <b>electrodes.</b> A model for calculating zero spatial frequency detective quantum efficiency, DQE (0), has been developed by including incomplete charge collection and x-ray interaction depth dependent conversion gain. The DQE(0) analyses of a-Se detectors for fluoroscopic applications show that there is an optimum photoconductor thickness, which maximizes the DQE(0) under a constant voltage operation. The application of DQE(0) model to different potential photoconductive detectors for fluoroscopic applications show that, in addition to high quantum efficiency, both high conversion gain and high charge collection efficiency are required to improve the DQE performance of an x-ray image detector. An analytical expression of MTF due to distributed carrier trapping in the bulk of the photoconductor has been derived using the trapped charge distribution across the photoconductor. Trapping of the carriers that move towards <b>the</b> <b>pixel</b> <b>electrodes</b> degrades <b>the</b> MTF performance, whereas trapping of the other type of carriers improves the sharpness of the x-ray image. The large signal model calculations in this thesis show an upper limit of small signal models of x-ray image detectors. The bimolecular recombination between drifting carriers plays practically no role on charge collection in a-Se detectors up to the total carrier generation rate q 0 of 10 ^ 18 EHPs/m^ 2 -s. The bimolecular recombination has practically no effect on charge collection in a-Se detectors for diagnostic medical x-ray imaging applications. A model for examining the sensitivity fluctuation mechanisms in a-Se detectors has been developed. The comparison of the model with the experimental data reveals that the recombination between trapped and the oppositely charged drifting carriers, electric field dependent charge carrier generation and x-ray induced new deep trap centers are mainly responsible for the sensitivity fluctuation in biased a-Se x-ray detectors. The modeling works in this thesis identify the important factors that limit the detector performance, which can ultimately lead to the reduction of patient exposure/dose consistent with better diagnosis for different diagnostic medical x-ray imaging modalities. The quantitative analyses presented in this thesis show that the detector structure is just as important to the overall performance of the detector as the material properties of the photoconductor itself...|$|R

Passive or active matrix-addressing of individual pixels require display elements that include proper signal addressability, which is typically provided by non-linear device characteristics or by incorporating transistors into each pixel, respectively. Including such additional devices into each pixel element make manufacturing of flexible displays using adequate printing techniques very hard or even impossible. Here, we report all-printed passive matrix-addressed electrochromic displays (PMAD) that can be manufactured using standard printing tools. Poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) serves as the conducting and electrochromic <b>pixel</b> <b>electrodes</b> and carbon paste is used as <b>the</b> <b>pixel</b> counter <b>electrodes.</b> These electrodes sandwich self-assembled layers of a polyelectrolyte that are confined to desired pixel areas via surface energy patterning.

Here, we report how such polymers and polyelectrolytes can be cast together with nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) derived from wood. The resulting films, which carry ionic or electronic functionalities, are all-organic, disposable, light-weight, flexible, self-adhesive, elastic and self-supporting. The mechanical and self-adhesive properties of the films enable simple and flexible electronic systems by assembling the films into various kinds of components using a "cut and stick" method. Additionally, the self-adhesive surfaces provide a new concept that not only allows for simplified system integration of printed electronic components, but also allows for a unique possibility to detach and reconfigure one or several subcomponents by a "peel and stick" method to create yet another device configuration. This is demonstrated by a stack of two films that first served as the electrolyte layer and <b>the</b> <b>pixel</b> <b>electrode</b> of an electrochromic display, which then was detached {{from each other and}} transferred to another configuration, thus becoming the electrolyte and gate electrode of an electrochemical transistor.

The concept of system reconfiguration was further explored by that a pixel electrode charged to its colored state could be detached and then integrated on top of a transistor channel.

40|$|Direct {{conversion}} {{flat panel}} x-ray imaging detector is presently {{one of the}} important tools in medical diagnosis of a patient. It provides an excellent image quality, portability, and dose utilization. Amorphous selenium based direct conversion detector with an active matrix array has been in the focus of researchers for the last two decades and extensive work and improvement have been done on this. There are several parameters of an x-ray imaging detector through which the imaging performance of a detector could be measured. The most important measure is the frequency, f, dependent detective quantum efficiency, DQE(f). In this thesis, we have proposed a parallel cascaded linear system model for calculating DQE(f) by considering the effects of K-fluorescence reabsorption, the range of primary photo electrons, charge carrier trapping, aperture function, noise aliasing, and addition of electronic noise. DQE (Detective Quantum Efficiency) depends significantly on the transport properties (mobility-lifetime product) and the creation of K-fluorescent x-ray photons. The DQE model is applied to fluoroscopic and mammographic detectors and is validated with the recent published experimental data. It has been found that the DQE(f) can be improved by ensuring that the carrier with the higher mobility-lifetime product is drifted towards <b>the</b> <b>pixel</b> <b>electrode,</b> i. e., the bottom electrode of the detector.

40|$|Current optical space telescopes {{rely upon}} silicon Charge Coupled Devices (CCDs) {{to detect and}} image the {{incoming}} photons. The performance of a CCD detector depends {{on its ability to}} transfer electrons through the silicon efficiently, so that the signal from every pixel may be read out through a single amplifier. This process of electron transfer is highly susceptible to the effects of solar proton damage (or non-ionizing radiation damage). This is because charged particles passing through the CCD displace silicon atoms, introducing energy levels into the semi-conductor bandgap which act as localized electron traps. The reduction in Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE) leads to signal loss and image smearing. The European Space Agency's astrometric Gaia mission will make extensive use of CCDs to create the most complete and accurate stereoscopic map to date of the Milky Way. In the context of the Gaia mission CTE is referred to with the complementary quantity Charge Transfer Inefficiency (CTI = 1 -CTE). CTI is an extremely important issue that threatens Gaia's performances.

40|$|Abstract: A {{pixelated}} X-ray {{semiconductor detector}} (=direct converter) is studied which contains an inhomogeneous electric field {{parallel to the}} depth axis caused by different concentrations of p- or n-doping. The X-ray energy deposition and charge movement within the detector is modeled in Monte-Carlo simulations which give access to astatistical analysis of electron drift times and current pulse widths for various degrees of static polarization. Integral charges induced on <b>the</b> <b>pixel</b> <b>electrodes</b> are evaluated and put to histograms of spectral detector responses and pulse height spectra (considering energy measurements before and after electronically pulse shaping, respectively). For n-doped semiconductors, the detector performance degrades due to pulse broadening. In contrast, a moderate p-doping can improve the detector performance by generating sharper electron pulses, {{as long as the}} detector is not limited by dynamical polarization. Conclusions: We performed Monte-Carlo simulations of energy deposition and charge movement within pixelated photon counting direct conversion detectors made of doped semiconductors of different acceptoror donor concentrations. Induced currents were statistically evaluated with the help of histograms of pulse width and total integral charge (represented before consideration of pulse shaper electronics in spectral responses, and after consideration of pulse shaper electronics in pulse height spectra, respectively). The electrical field close to anode pixels was identified as the main quantity defining the pulse characteristics. For n-doped semiconductors, a weaker electric field near <b>the</b> <b>pixel</b> anodes and longer total electron drift timesare seen, which results in broader pulse widths and a degradation of the spectral responses (by enhanced charge sharing) and pulse height spectra. In contrast, for p-doped semiconductors, a strengthenedelectric field near the anodes and an, on average, reduced total drift time is seen, which results in shorter pulse widths. For moderatep-doping concentrations n_A &# 8804; 0. 9 n_max, an improvement of the spectral response (less charge sharing) and pulse height spectrumis seen. For p-doping concentrations close to the limit still allowing full depletion, n_A > 0. 9 n_max, the spectral response und pulseheight spectrum degrade again due to charges which experience long drift times when created in a region with weakened electric field near the cathode. We conclude that using moderately p-doped semiconductor material, n_A &# 8776; 0. 5 n_max, improves detector performance aslong as the detector is not limited by dynamical polarization. In the latter case, it has to be noted that a p-doped semiconductor reduces the maximum count rate at which catastrophic dynamical polarization occurs...|$|R

40|$|Today active-matrix organic {{light-emitting}} displays (AM-OLEDs) {{are considered}} as next generation flat panel display. In this thesis, several {{hydrogenated amorphous silicon}} (a-Si:H) thin-film transistor (TFT) technologies {{have been developed to}} accelerate the AM-OLED development. Among others to address the charging time delay issue of the conventional current-driven a-Si:H TFT <b>pixel</b> <b>electrode</b> circuit, a non-linear current scaling-function by cascaded-capacitors connected to the driving TFT was investigated. To enhance the performance of fabricated <b>pixel</b> <b>electrode</b> circuit, novel design of a-Si:H pixel circuit with cascaded storage capacitors was investigated based on the current-mirror structure. The electrical and thermal stability of the proposed a-Si:H TFT <b>pixel</b> <b>electrode</b> circuits were also explored in comparison to the conventional current-driven circuit. To address the inherent electrical stability issue of the a-Si:H TFT, two novel a-Si:H TFT structures were proposed: Corbino and Hexagonal TFTs. It was shown that both a-Si:H TFT structures have the asymmetric electrical characteristics under different drain bias conditions. To extract the electrical device parameters, asymmetric geometric factors were developed for different drain bias conditions. By using multiple Hexagonal TFT structure, the output current of Hexagonal a-Si:H TFT connected in parallel increases linearly with their number within a given pixel circuit. Current-voltage measurements indicate that a high ON-OFF current ratio and a low sub-threshold slope can be maintained for multiple Hexagonal TFTs connected in parallel while the field-effect mobility and threshold voltage remain identical to a single HEX a-Si:H TFT. Due to a unique device geometry, enhanced electrical stability and larger pixel aperture ratio can be achieved in the multiple a-Si:H HEX-TFT in comparison to standard single a-Si:H TFT having same channel width. Lastly, the dynamic responses of different a-Si:H TFT structures with various storage capacitor size were explored for AM-OLEDs. The effect of dofferent storage capacitors and overlap capacitors of TFTs on the charging time and feed-through voltage characteristics of the a-Si:H switching TFT were explored. Feed-through voltage behavior of Corbino a-Si:H TFT was also discussed in comparison to normal rectangular a-Si:H TFT as a switching TFT for AM-OLEDs...|$|R
