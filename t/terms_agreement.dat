50|$|Lloyds Banking Group {{reached a}} Heads of <b>Terms</b> <b>agreement</b> in July 2012 {{to sell the}} Verde {{branches}} to The Co-operative Bank for £750 million. The final transfer of TSB Bank plc to the new owner was due {{to be completed by}} late 2013. In February 2013, it was reported that Lloyds Banking Group were considering a stock market flotation of the TSB business as an alternative, should the transfer not be completed. On 24 April 2013, The Co-operative Bank decided not to proceed with the acquisition because of the economic downturn and the tough regulatory environment imposed on banks. Lloyds Banking Group said that the rebranding to TSB Bank would still take place and that the new bank will be divested through an initial public offering in 2014. TSB Bank began operations on 9 September 2013, under CEO Paul Pester.|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} part of this paper, we study the back-reaction of large-N light cone {{momentum}} on the maximally supersymmetric anti-pp-wave background. This gives the type IIA geometry of large-N D 0 -branes on curved space with fluxes. By taking an appropriate decoupling limit, we conjecture a new duality between string theory on that background and dual field theory on D 0 -branes which we derive by calculating linear coupling <b>terms.</b> <b>Agreement</b> of decoupling quantities, SO(3) × SO(6) isometry and Higgs branch on both theories are shown. Also we find whenever dual field theory is weakly coupled, the curvature of the geometry is large. In the second part of this paper, we derive the supermembrane action on a general pp-wave background only through the properties of null Killing vector and through this, derive the Matrix model.

40|$|International audienceWe {{aimed to}} {{construct}} and validate a shortened form of the developmental, diagnostic and dimensional interview (3 Di), a parent report interview for assessing and diagnosing autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs). Data from 879 {{children and young people}} were used. In half of the sample ( =  440) reliability analysis was used to identify 3 Di items that best measured each dimension of the autism triad. This informed the construction of a shortened (53 item) 3 Di, which was then validated on subjects not used in the reliability analysis ( =  439). This involved comparison with scores from the original 3 Di algorithm and, in a subsample ( =  29), with the autism diagnostic interview-revised (ADI-R). Agreement of the new shortened 3 Di with the 3 Di's original algorithm was excellent in both dimensional and categorical <b>terms.</b> <b>Agreement</b> on caseness (27 out of 29) with the ADI-R was also strong. The new 3 Di short version is less than half as long as the original version and outputs very similar scores. It will be useful to clinicians and researchers for obtaining a dimensional autism assessment in less than 45  minutes...|$|E

40|$|The Boussinesq {{equation}} for {{subsurface flow}} in an idealized sloping aquifer of unit width {{has recently been}} extended to hillslopes of arbitrary geometry by incorporating the hillslope width function w(x) into the governing equation, where x is the flow distance {{along the length of}} the hillslope [Troch et al., 2003]. Introduction of a source/sink term N allows simulation of storm-interstorm sequences in addition to drainage processes, while a function S c (x) representing the maximum subsurface water storage can be used to account for surface saturation response in variable source areas activated by the saturation excess mechanism of runoff generation. The model can thus simulate subsurface flow and storage dynamics for nonidealized (more realistic) hillslope configurations. In this paper we assess the behavior of this relatively simple, one-dimensional model in a series of intercomparison tests with a fully three-dimensional Richards equation model. Special attention is given to the discretization and setup of the boundary and initial conditions for seven representative hillslopes of uniform, convergent, and divergent plan shape. Drainage and recharge experiments are conducted on these hillslopes for both gentle (5 %) and steep (30 %) bedrock slope angles. The treatment and influence of the drainable porosity parameter are also considered, and for the uniform (idealized) hillslope case the impact of the unsaturated zone is examined by running simulations for different capillary fringe heights. In general terms, the intercomparison results show that the hillslope-storage Boussinesq model is able to capture the broad shapes of the storage and outflow profiles for all of the hillslope configurations. In specific <b>terms,</b> <b>agreement</b> with the Richards equation results varies according to the scenario being simulated. The best matches in outflow hydrographs were obtained for the drainage experiments, suggesting a greater influence of the unsaturated zone under recharge conditions due to transmission of water throughout the hillslope. In the spatiotemporal water table response a better match was observed for convergent than divergent hillslopes, and the bedrock slope angle was not found to greatly influence the quality of the agreement between the two models. On the basis of the intercomparison experiments we make some suggestions for further development and testing of the hillslope-storage mode...|$|E
