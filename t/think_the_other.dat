500|$|Greene {{and middle}} linebacker Jack Lambert became the {{emotional}} leaders of Pittsburgh's defensive squad. Greene {{was described as}} a huge presence {{both on and off the}} field. Once, in the locker room, a teammate was loudly voicing his discontent over the long and cold practice they had just gone through as he yanked off his equipment. At a nearby locker, Greene lifted his head and silently glared at him. [...] "Believe me, that's all Joe did, he never even said anything," [...] Joe Gordon of the Steelers front office recalled. [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> players saw Joe glare at him. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> player just felt it, and then he sat down and never said another word." [...] A natural leader, Greene was named the captain of the defense in 1977. His leadership was also channeled to the offense; Lynn Swann, a wide receiver, considered Greene a mentor. [...] "If you were giving less than 100 percent, he let you know one way or the other," [...] said Swann.|$|E

500|$|Phát and Đức {{could not}} {{apprehend}} Khánh, who had escaped {{the capital and}} flown to the Central Highlands resort town of Da Lat. Their forces stormed Khánh's office and captured his duty officers but {{could not find the}} junta leader. There was then a lull in the movement of troops and units. One Vietnamese public servant said that [...] "All these preparations are the result of a big misunderstanding on both sides. I don't think either group will start anything, but both <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> will." [...] Taylor was on an emergency flight from Honolulu—where he had been in meetings with senior American military figures—back to Saigon and he said the coup [...] "certainly was unannounced and unheralded." [...] In the mid-afternoon Khánh made a radio broadcast on a loyalist system, condemning the coup and calling on the military to remain loyal, claiming that support for the [...] "rebellious leaders" [...] would play {{into the hands of the}} Viet Cong.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2014, Donovan {{was named}} in the {{preliminary}} squad for the 2014 World Cup and joined the team in training camp. However, on May 22, 2014, he was controversially omitted from the final U.S. squad by manager Jürgen Klinsmann. Klinsmann called it [...] "one of the toughest decisions in [...] coaching career", but said, [...] "I just <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> guys right now {{are a little bit}} ahead of him." [...] Klinsmann's decision, which was described by media staff as abruptly timed after Klinsmann had previously promised to wait until after the team's friendly matches to announce cuts, saw additional controversy when Klinsmann's son Jonathan published and later deleted a post on Twitter that appeared to ridicule Donovan following the announcement.|$|E
2500|$|Several critics {{theorized that}} another {{probable}} {{factor in the}} film's box office failure was the confusion related to its title. Cyriaque Lamar of Cracked.com notes that [...] "udiences expecting mystical weirdness a la The Exorcist walked out of theaters" [...] which in turn forced distributors to put [...] "ads that Sorcerer was 'NOT A FILM ABOUT THE SUPERNATURAL'." [...] Film critic Gene Siskel thought Sorcerer was a [...] "very bad title". To him the title might have indicated a certain likeness to The Exorcist and thought the audiences {{at the time were}} either bored with yet another film about exorcisms or that was precisely what they wanted and upon seeing the movie, they got confused, asking themselves [...] "where's the devil?" [...] Siskel also thought each of the production companies would <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> one would handle the promotion, and nobody perceived it as a [...] "sole project of their own, it was dropped in-between them." [...] On the other hand, Roger Ebert expressed his disappointment about the movie's box office performance by saying that [...] "you could make more than that just by opening in the first week, people stumbling into a wrong theater looking for Bruce Lee," [...] as well as blamed Universal and Paramount for the lack of support. Friedkin stated that his attitude throughout the making of the film [...] "alienated the top management of two studios", and as a consequence they did not feel compelled to support it.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the Big 8's {{official}} {{ruling on}} the matter, the reactions from many {{on all sides}} were not {{in agreement with the}} Big 8 committee in the end. When asked at the Look All-America gathering in New York City Missouri All-American, Danny LaRose said, [...] "It'll always be a 9–1 season as far as I'm concerned. And I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> players will feel that way, too." [...] However, LaRose also expressed his admiration of the Big Eight [...] "for standing up for what was right – enforcing its own rules". Also at the gathering, Colorado All-American guard Joe Romig echoed similar feelings when he said, [...] "I don't care what the NCAA or the Big Eight does. We lost the game at Kansas. Nothing will change that." [...] Meanwhile, Kansas All-American quarterback John Hadl expressed more concern about his teammate when asked at the All-America gathering and had this to say, [...] "He's a good guy. I hope it doesn't hit him too hard." [...] Missouri head coach Dan Devine expressed his apparent disappointment in the process adopted by the Big 8 when he said, [...] "This is {{the worst thing that could}} happen in inter-collegiate athletics. I mean the fact that they were playing a boy not knowing he was ineligible. That should have been determined before he played." [...] For his part then executive secretary of the Big 8, Reaves Peters, said the case was the [...] "toughest case to come before us in history".|$|E
