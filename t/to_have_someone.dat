5|$|Espen Skjønberg as Trygve Sissener: Trygve {{lives alone}} {{in one of}} the finer parts of Oslo, and when he meets Odd he is happy <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>someone</b> to share a few drinks with. Skjønberg has been a {{presence}} in Norwegian theatre and film since 1945, and debuted on film as a child, as early as 1937. He has received several awards, among them an honorary Amanda in 2004.|$|E
5|$|When {{you throw}} a {{cat in the}} oven, it's easy <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>someone</b> in the {{orchestra}} slam a hammer down on an anvil, scaring {{the hell out of}} everyone. The hard part is manipulating the story and accenting the characters. In the beginning, when Todd is laying down the rules, there's a certain repetitive thematic idea you hear. You hear the same music when Dussander is turning the tables on Todd, which makes you remember the first scene... You hope people are subliminally making the connection that the tables are turning back and forth.|$|E
5|$|On 23 October 1862, Otto of Bavaria, King of Greece was deposed in a bloodless coup. The Greeks {{were eager}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>someone</b> close to Britain and Queen Victoria replace Otto; some desired to allow Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh (her second son) succeed as King of Greece. He was elected with 95% {{of the vote}} in the Greek head of state {{referendum}} of 1862. After his ineligibility was confirmed however, the Greeks began looking for other possible candidates, which included Duke Ernest at the British government's suggestion. To their and Victoria's reasoning, if Ernest were to take the Greek throne, Alfred could immediately take up his inheritance and succeed Ernest as duke (the Prince of Wales having passed his claim to the duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha onto his younger brother). Many were in favor of his nomination, including Prime Minister Lord Palmerston and Ernest's sister-in-law. In a letter written to her uncle Leopold I of Belgium, Victoria stated her support for a new royal branch of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (as Leopold had been chosen as King of the Belgians in 1831) as well as her desire for her second son Alfred to succeed his uncle in the duchy. As negotiations continued however, she began to lose enthusiasm for the idea.|$|E

[...] Julian was voted Dartford's player of the season for the 2013–14 season.|$|R
25|$|In some cases, {{where the}} person named as {{executor}} cannot administer the probate, or wishes <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>someone</b> else do so, another person is named administrator.

Kemp bolts for the town, where the local citizenry come to his aid. Griffin is seized, assaulted, and killed by a mob. The Invisible Man's naked, battered body gradually becomes visible as he dies. A local policeman shouts <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>someone</b> cover Griffin's face with a sheet.|$|E

25|$|One {{substitute}} for a swift is <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>someone</b> else hold the hank. This has several disadvantages however, first a willing second person has to be found, and secondly unless the other person has {{had a lot of}} practice holding hanks, the yarn winds off a swift much better. Yarn tends to catch on the hands and wristwatches of the person holding the hank, and a swift has neither hand nor watch to catch the yarn.|$|E
25|$|In modern times, {{cottonseed}} oil was marketed by Procter & Gamble as a creamed shortening in 1911. Ginning mills were happy <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>someone</b> haul away the cotton seeds. The extracted oil was refined and partially hydrogenated {{to give a}} solid at room temperature and thus mimic natural lard, and can it under nitrogen gas. Compared to the rendered lard Procter & Gamble was already selling to consumers, Crisco was cheaper, easier to stir into a recipe, and could be stored {{at room temperature for}} two years without turning rancid.|$|E
25|$|During the Middle Ages in Europe, castles, fortresses, and the basements {{of public}} {{buildings}} were {{often used as}} makeshift prisons. The possession of {{the right and the}} capability to imprison citizens, however, granted an air of legitimacy to officials at all levels of government, from kings to regional courts to city councils; and the ability <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>someone</b> imprisoned or killed served as a signifier of who in society possessed power or authority over others. Another common punishment was sentencing people to galley slavery, which involved chaining prisoners together in the bottoms of ships and forcing them to row on naval or merchant vessels.|$|E

60|$|To Crispin's chagrin {{there were}} no horses <b>to</b> be <b>had.</b> <b>Someone</b> in great haste had ridden through before them, and taken what relays the hostelry could give, leaving four jaded beasts in the stable. It seemed, indeed, that they must remain there until the morrow, and in coming to that conclusion, Sir Crispin's temper {{suffered}} sorely.|$|R
25|$|Immediately {{after this}} agonizing pedicure, the girl's broken toes were folded back under and the feet were rebound. The {{bindings}} were pulled even tighter {{each time the}} girl's feet were rebound. This unbinding and rebinding ritual was repeated {{as often as possible}} (for the rich at least once daily, for poor peasants {{two or three times a}} week), with fresh bindings. It was generally an elder female member of the girl's family or a professional foot binder who carried out the initial breaking and ongoing binding of the feet. It was considered preferable <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>someone</b> other than the mother do it, as she might have been sympathetic to her daughter's pain and less willing to keep the bindings tight.|$|E
25|$|When Megan Reeves was kidnapped, Don {{pushed his}} ethics {{to the limit}} to get her back. While he did not {{personally}} beat a suspect, he had Special Agent Ian Edgerton interrogate the teenager for information on where Megan was being held. It is never shown or said what Edgerton did during the interrogation, but it is heavily implied {{that he may have}} used physical force, up to and including applying pressure to the gunshot wound through the teen's wrist; Don expressed concern to his father over being willing to go that far, even if he wasn't doing it himself. After this discussion, he convinced his father that it is good <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>someone</b> to come home to, and that is why he comes around the Craftsman house so often rather than staying at his apartment.|$|E
25|$|After her imprisonment, Bembenek filed three {{unsuccessful}} appeals of her conviction citing police {{errors in}} handling of key {{evidence and the}} fact that one of the prosecution's witnesses, Judy Zess, had recanted her testimony, stating it was made under duress. Bembenek and her supporters also alleged that Milwaukee police may have singled her out for prosecution because of her role as a key witness in a federal investigation into police corruption. Bembenek's supporters suggested that Fred Schultz may have arranged <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>someone</b> else murder his ex-wife. One possible candidate was Frederick Horenberger, a career criminal who briefly worked with Schultz on a remodeling project and was a former boyfriend of Judy Zess. A disguised Horenberger had robbed and beaten Judy Zess several weeks prior to Christine Schultz's murder and would later serve a ten-year sentence for that crime.|$|E
2500|$|Adele first {{intended}} to title the album Rolling in the Deep, her {{adaptation of the}} slang phrase [...] "roll deep," [...] which summarises how she felt about her relationship; in her loose translation, the phrase refers <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>someone</b> [...] "that <b>has</b> your back" [...] and always supports you. However, the singer later deemed the title too confusing for some of her audiences. Although she <b>had</b> wanted <b>to</b> avoid the number motif of her debut, Adele considered [...] "21" [...] the most fitting title as it represented her age {{at the time of}} the album's composition, serving as an autobiographical period piece, and symbolised the personal maturity and artistic evolution since her debut.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{members of}} the {{open-source}} community, most notably Gilad Ben-Yossef and Doron Ofek, pioneered the idea of forming an official, legally recognized organization. They wanted to counter difficulties with the non-open-source-related bodies and to address the inherently decentralized way open source is developed and advocated. Two main bodies expected to deal with organizations in that respect: the media, which is accustomed <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> call to get a comment, and the Knesset, where standing {{up in front of}} legislators requires answering the implicit question [...] "who am I and why should you listen to me?". It was felt that, as individuals, the community's ability to make a difference suffered in comparison with an organized body.|$|R

25|$|According to Appian, in 60 BC Caesar {{came back}} from his {{governorship}} in Hispania (Spain and Portugal) and was awarded a triumph for his victories there. He was making preparations to celebrate this outside the city walls. He also {{wanted to be a}} candidate for the consulship for 59 BC. However, the candidates had to present themselves in the city and it was not legal for those who were preparing a triumph to enter the city and then go back out for these preparations. Since he was not ready yet, Caesar asked to be allowed to register in absentia and <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>someone</b> to act on his behalf, even though this was contrary to the law. Cato the Younger, who was against this, used up {{the last day of the}} presentation with speeches. Caesar dropped the triumph, entered the city and presented his candidacy. Pompey had failed to get the acts for his settlements he made in the east during the Third Mithridatic War ratified by the senate. Most senators opposed this because they were envious, particularly Lucius Licinius Lucullus who had been replaced in the command of this war by Pompey. Crassus had co-operated with Lucullus in this matter. An aggrieved Pompey ‘made friends with Caesar and promised under oath to support him for the consulship'. Caesar then brought Crassus into friendly relations with Pompey and ‘these three most powerful men pooled their interests.’ Appian also noted that Marcus Terentius Varro wrote a book about this alliance called Tricaranus (the three-headed monster). Appian's version and Plutarch's Life of Pompey are the only sources that have Pompey seeking an alliance with Caesar, rather than the other way round.|$|E

Martínez offered to help, and Cisneros gave her the money and a {{photograph}} of Fischer. Martínez gave these to one of her clients, Daniel Orlando Garza who contacted two Mexican hitmen from Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Israel Olivarez Cepeda and Heriberto Puentes Pizaña, who killed Fischer and then escaped to Mexico. The killing drew national attention because of the unusual circumstances surrounding the crime.|$|E
