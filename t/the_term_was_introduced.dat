25|$|The term bandura is {{generally}} {{thought to have}} entered the Ukrainian language via Polish, either from Latin or from the Greek pandora or pandura, although some scholars feel that <b>the</b> <b>term</b> <b>was</b> <b>introduced</b> into Ukraine directly from the Greek language.|$|E
25|$|Hylozoism is the {{philosophical}} {{point of view}} that matter is in some sense alive. The concept dates back {{at least as far as}} the Milesian school of pre-Socratic philosophers. <b>The</b> <b>term</b> <b>was</b> <b>introduced</b> to English by Ralph Cudworth in 1678.|$|E

25|$|Latent heat is {{the heat}} {{released}} or absorbed by a chemical substance or a thermodynamic system during {{a change of}} state that occurs without a change in temperature. Such a process may be a phase transition, such as the melting of ice or the boiling of water. <b>The</b> <b>term</b> <b>was</b> <b>introduced</b> around 1750 by Joseph Black as derived from the Latin latere (to lie hidden), characterizing its effect as not being directly measurable with a thermometer.|$|E
25|$|To {{increase}} memory capacity and bandwidth, chips are combined on a module. For instance, the 64-bit data bus for DIMM requires eight 8-bit chips, addressed in parallel. Multiple chips {{with the common}} address lines are called a memory rank. <b>The</b> <b>term</b> <b>was</b> <b>introduced</b> to avoid confusion with chip internal rows and banks. A memory module may bear more than one rank. The term sides would also be confusing because it incorrectly suggests the physical placement of chips on the module.|$|E
25|$|The {{infinite}} canvas {{refers to}} the potentially limitless space that is available to webcomics presented on the World Wide Web. <b>The</b> <b>term</b> <b>was</b> <b>introduced</b> by Scott McCloud in his 2000 book Reinventing Comics, in which he suggested that webcomic creators could make a Web page as large as needed to contain a comic page of any conceivable size. This infinite canvas would create an endless amount of storytelling benefits and would allow creators much more freedom in how they present their artwork.|$|E

25|$|The Little Ice Age (LIA) was {{a period}} of cooling that {{occurred}} after the Medieval Warm Period. Although it was not a true ice age, <b>the</b> <b>term</b> <b>was</b> <b>introduced</b> into scientific literature by François E. Matthes in 1939. It has been conventionally defined as a period extending from the 16th to the 19th centuries, but some experts prefer an alternative timespan from about 1300 to about 1850. Climatologists and historians working with local records no longer expect to agree on either the start or end dates of the period, which varied according to local conditions.|$|E
2500|$|In Economy of Machinery was {{described}} {{what is now}} called the [...] "Babbage principle". It pointed out commercial advantages available with more careful division of labour. As Babbage himself noted, it had already appeared in the work of Melchiorre Gioia in 1815. <b>The</b> <b>term</b> <b>was</b> <b>introduced</b> in 1974 by Harry Braverman. Related formulations are the [...] "principle of multiples" [...] of Philip Sargant Florence, and the [...] "balance of processes".|$|E
2500|$|In the Philippines, {{a former}} Spanish colony, many modern Filipinos call the large, local Muslim {{minority}} concentrated in Mindanao and other southern islands Moros. The word is a catch-all term, as Moro {{may come from}} several distinct ethno-linguistic {{groups such as the}} Maranao people. <b>The</b> <b>term</b> <b>was</b> <b>introduced</b> by Spanish colonisers, and has since been appropriated by Filipino Muslims as an endonym, with many self-identifying as members of the Bangsamoro [...] "Moro Nation".|$|E

2500|$|The term Kievan Rus ( [...] ) {{was coined}} in the 19th century in Russian historiography {{to refer to}} the period when the centre was in Kiev.

2500|$|Textbooks in Israel {{also have}} been studied and some {{problems}} found. Israel has ordered the word Nakba, meaning disaster or catastrophe and which refers to the foundation of Israel in 1948 and the subsequent forced flight of the Palestinians from Israel-captured land, {{to be removed from}} Israeli Arab textbooks. <b>The</b> <b>term</b> <b>was</b> <b>introduced</b> in books for use in Arab schools in 2007 when the Education Ministry was run by Yuli Tamir of the Labour party.

2500|$|A shaman {{is someone}} who is {{regarded}} as having access to, and influence in, the world of benevolent and malevolent spirits, who typically enters into a trance state during a ritual, and practices divination and healing. The word [...] "shaman" [...] probably originates from the Tungusic Evenki language of North Asia. According to ethnolinguist Juha Janhunen, [...] "the word is attested {{in all of the}} Tungusic idioms" [...] such as Negidal, Lamut, Udehe/Orochi, Nanai, Ilcha, Orok, Manchu and Ulcha, and [...] "nothing seems to contradict the assumption that the meaning 'shaman' also derives from Proto-Tungusic" [...] and may have roots that extend back in time at least two millennia. <b>The</b> <b>term</b> <b>was</b> <b>introduced</b> to the west after Russian forces conquered the shamanistic Khanate of Kazan in 1552.|$|E

50|$|Following {{the life}} and work of famous mathematicians from antiquity to the present, Stewart traces mathematics' {{developing}} handling {{of the concept of}} symmetry. One of the very first takeaways, established in the preface of this book, is that it dispels the idea of the origins of symmetry in geometry, as is often the first context in which <b>the</b> <b>term</b> <b>is</b> <b>introduced.</b> This book, through its chapters, establishes its origins in algebra, more specifically group theory.|$|R
50|$|In philosophy, A-series and B-series are two {{different}} descriptions of the temporal ordering relation among events.
