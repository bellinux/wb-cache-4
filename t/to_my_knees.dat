2500|$|She did {{not claim}} that she fought until being wounded, {{but she did}} say her weapon jammed {{immediately}} and {{that she could not}} have done anything anyway. Interviewed by Diane Sawyer, Lynch claimed, concerning the media and the Pentagon: [...] "They used me to symbolize all this stuff. It's wrong. I don't know why they filmed [...] or why they say these things." [...] She also stated [...] "I did not shoot, not a round, nothing. I went down praying <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees.</b> And that's the last I remember." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I'm {{not ashamed}} to say that I shed tears almost {{all the way through}} and that when the play was {{finished}} I rushed up to her and fell <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> at her feet. The human drama, the play of a woman's great valor and an artist's truth, her own, far superseded, and even eclipsed, to my eye, the performance of my own play." [...] The director remarked that her performance exceeded Jessica Tandy and Vivien Leigh's in the role. However, the initial reviews had decided the production's fate, and the producer pulled the plug after 15 performances.|$|E

6000|$|Spring and daisies came apace; [...] Grasses hide my hiding-place; [...] Grasses {{run like}} a green sea [...] O'er the lawn up <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knee.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Did I {{not tell}} thee {{that within a}} little space thou wouldst creep <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knee,</b> oh Kallikrates? And surely the space {{has not been a}} great one!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yet {{within a}} very little space shalt thou creep <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knee,</b> and swear that thou dost love me," [...] {{answered}} Ayesha, with a sweet, mocking laugh. [...] "Come, {{there is no time}} like the present time, here before this dead girl who loved thee, let us put it to the proof.|$|R
60|$|I {{struggled}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees,</b> and if ever I felt terrified {{in my life}} it was then, and I am {{not ashamed}} to say that I hesitated and hung back.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{never wear}} that old muslin again; it's full of darns, up <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees,</b> and {{all out of}} fashion. So is my sacque; and as for my hat, though it does well enough here, it would be absurd for Class Day." ...|$|E
60|$|But, {{with a final}} effort, as I sank weakly <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> I hurled {{the nine}} thought waves at that awful thing before me. The Martian had crawled to my side and with staring {{eyes fixed on the}} single panel before us we waited in the silence of death.|$|E
6000|$|<b>My</b> love <b>to</b> your dear little one. I begin <b>to</b> feel <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> {{preparing}} <b>to</b> {{make ready}} for the reception of the Lady Arthritis. God bless you and ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{tethered}} {{his horse}} to an iron peg, beckoned {{me to do}} the same, and then, moving forward until we stood on the highest of the rise, pointed to something that rose darkly from the grass. Then I remembered, and swung <b>my</b> hat <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knee,</b> as <b>my</b> eyes rested on a little wooden cross. Following the hand he stretched out, I could read the rude letters cut on it--"Helen Boone." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Here," [...] said Ville, tipping out the {{contents}} of his bag, [...] "horse liniment <b>to</b> keep <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> warm. And pills? You want to see the pills?" [...] They got out three boxes apiece.|$|R
6000|$|And {{now here}} is a blot upon my life. At these words of mine the Master turned his blade against my bosom; I saw the light run along the steel; and I threw up my arms and fell <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> before him on the floor. [...] "No, no," [...] I cried, like a baby.|$|E
60|$|It was I {{who was now}} favoured by a quick look. He was {{wondering}} if I were making fun of him. I put three or four spokes over to counteract a sheer toward the wind {{on the part of}} the Ghost, and then steadied her. Wolf Larsen was still waiting an explanation, and I pointed down <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Since I {{came there}} first to boarding-school," [...] she answered. [...] "A little child I was, with my hair in {{pigtails}} and frocks <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees.</b> I {{have learned to}} think, somehow, that Paris is my home. What I have heard of South America I do not love. I wish very much that my uncle would stay here." ...|$|E
25|$|Herrera {{remained}} conscious for {{the next}} few hours. At the aid station, he said to the examining doctor, “Just try <b>to</b> save <b>my</b> <b>knees,</b> Doc.” After two months in an Army field hospital, he was sent to the Army Amputation Center in Utah.|$|R
6000|$|... "Think of it, Thirza--that child! Why, it's {{only a year}} or two {{since she}} used <b>to</b> sit on <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> and tickle <b>my</b> face with her hair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not mad," [...] {{said the}} gentleman ruefully, extricating {{himself from his}} position. [...] "Dearest Miss Hazeltine, I vow <b>to</b> you upon <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> I am not mad!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Kneel," [...] he bade me. And {{realising}} what {{he would}} be about, I sank on <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> whilst he murmured the Apostolic benediction over my bowed head. The rushes of the floor were the only witnesses of the smile that crept to my lips at this sudden assumption of his churchly office by that most worldly prince.|$|E
60|$|Seeing me {{standing}} there before {{a bevy of}} armed Zulus, she promptly fell upon my neck with a cry for help, for the silly woman {{thought she was going}} to be killed by them. Gripping me as an octopus grips its prey, she proceeded to faint, dragging me <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> beneath the weight of eleven stone of solid flesh.|$|E
60|$|I was {{the last}} to leave the chamber of the submarine, and as I {{followed}} the rear of the column toward the corridor, I moved through water <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees.</b> The corridor, too, was flooded to the same depth, for its floor was on a level with the floor of the chamber from which it led, nor was there any perceptible rise for many yards.|$|E
60|$|G. Some men are different. I haven't the nerve. Lord help me, I haven't the nerve! I've {{taken up}} {{a hole and}} a half <b>to</b> get <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> well under the wallets. I can't help it. I'm so afraid of {{anything}} happening <b>to</b> me. On <b>my</b> soul, I ought to be broke {{in front of the}} squadron, for cowardice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Another {{long pause}} ensued before, {{with a great}} effort, he whispered hoarsely: 'Isn't this enough to move a heart of stone? Am I <b>to</b> go on <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> <b>to</b> you?' ...|$|R
60|$|I peered keenly {{into the}} blackness. At length I reached the slope. Here I dropped <b>to</b> <b>my</b> hands and <b>knees.</b>|$|R
60|$|At length that cloud did {{pass and}} in faint outline I saw the {{classical}} head of my Amahagger bowed in deep sleep. With a heart beating {{as it does}} only in the fierce extremities of love or war, I hissed like a snake, which was our agreed signal. Then rising <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees,</b> I lifted the Zulu axe and struck with all my strength.|$|E
60|$|Not {{another word}} was spoken. I heard the Count close the library door. I heard Sir Percival barring up the window-shutters. It had been raining, raining all the time. I was cramped by my {{position}} and chilled to the bones. When I first tried to move, {{the effort was}} so painful to me that I was obliged to desist. I tried a second time, and succeeded in rising <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> on the wet roof.|$|E
60|$|Worn {{out with}} this torture of thought, I rose <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees.</b> Night was come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for the {{companionship}} of fear. We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread before us; {{and it is in}} the unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, His omnipotence, His omnipresence. I had risen <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> to pray for Mr. Rochester. Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty Milky- way. Remembering what it was--what countless systems there swept space like a soft trace of light--I felt the might and strength of God. Sure was I of His efficiency to save what He had made: convinced I grew that neither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured. I turned my prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the Saviour of spirits. Mr. Rochester was safe; he was God's, and by God would he be guarded. I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere long in sleep forgot sorrow.|$|E
6000|$|... "I also am angry, uncle; {{very angry}} with Lady Arabella; but for him, for the squire, I would go <b>to</b> him on <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> if {{he asked me}} in that way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. It couldn't do much harm, I s'pose, an' if {{you think}} it would please her any better, why, I'm willin' <b>to</b> stay on <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> half a day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{was nothing}} in that, sir. I have heard my father, who is a doctor, say that a man could kill the biggest dog {{if he could get}} it down on its back and kneel on it. So when I once managed <b>to</b> get <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> on it I felt it was all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|So dear, so lovely--those {{eyes that}} had once been the light of my heart, mourned for me and judged me now. They saw the guilty thought that {{polluted}} me; they brought me <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees,</b> imploring him to help me back to my better self: [...] "One last mercy, dear, to comfort me under the loss of you. Let the love that was once my life, be my good angel still. Save me, Philip, even though you forsake me--save me from myself!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Antelope!" [...] {{she whispered}} in my ear, and, as I raised my head, she pointed up-river. Crawling <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees,</b> I {{looked in the}} {{direction}} she indicated, to see a buck standing upon a little knoll some two hundred yards from us. There was good cover between the animal and me, and so, though I might have hit him at two hundred yards, I preferred to crawl closer to him and make sure of the meat we both so craved.|$|E
60|$|So {{this was}} the end of all my efforts to secure the safety and {{well-being}} of that most unlucky pair. I wept when I thought of it there {{in the darkness of the}} hut, for the candle had burned out, and going on <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees,</b> put up an earnest prayer for the welfare of their souls; also that I might be forgiven my folly in leading them into such danger. And yet I did it for the best, trying to judge wisely in the light of such experience of the world as I possessed.|$|E
60|$|CAPT. G. Some men are different. I haven't any nerve. Lord help me, I haven't the nerve! I've {{taken up}} {{a hole and}} a half <b>to</b> get <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> well under the wallets. I can't help it. I'm so afraid of {{anything}} happening <b>to</b> me. On <b>my</b> soul, I ought to be broke {{in front of the}} squadron, for cowardice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bostil won't {{lose his}} only girl--or his {{favorite}} hoss! ... Lucy, I never had no girl. But it seems I'm rememberin' them rides you used <b>to</b> have on <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> when you was little!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was turned}} {{out of the}} dining-room at once, and sent here until the {{committee}} have decided {{what to do with}} me. Oh, sir, I am willing <b>to</b> go on <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> <b>to</b> Mr. B----" ...|$|R
