She felt {{that it would be}} casting a slight on Arthur; and she assured Lady Martindale that she hoped soon to leave London, and how {{impossible}} it was for her <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>house</b> without Arthur. It seemed to be a great disappointment, and opened to Violet a fresh insight into Lady Martindale's nature; that there was a warm current beneath, only stifled by Mrs. Nesbit's power over a docile character. There seemed to be hopes that they might love each other at last! In the midst {{there was a knock at}} the door, and Lord Martindale entered, much surprised, as well as pleased, to find his wife there, though put in some perplexity by her instantly appealing to him to tell Violet that it was very bad for the children to remain in town, and asking if it could not be managed to send them to the sea-side.

It was not till after their departure that Violet discovered that he had been trying to atone for deficiencies, by costly gifts to herself and her children.|$|E
