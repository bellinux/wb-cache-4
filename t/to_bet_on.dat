5|$|The 2007 NBA betting scandal was {{a scandal}} {{involving}} the National Basketball Association (NBA) and accusations that an NBA referee used {{his knowledge of}} relationships between referees, coaches, players and owners <b>to</b> <b>bet</b> <b>on</b> professional basketball games. In July 2007, reports of {{an investigation by the}} Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) were made public, which alleged that during the 2005–06 and 2006–07 NBA seasons, referee Tim Donaghy bet on games in which he officiated.|$|E

5|$|Returning from Melee are trophies, statuettes {{of video}} game {{characters}} and objects that give brief histories or descriptions of their subjects, such as Mario and Link, or other characters and items {{that appear in}} their respective series. A minigame, the Coin Launcher, replaces the lottery machine from Melee as the primary method of obtaining trophies. The Coin Launcher is a machine that uses coins as projectiles to shoot trophies and counter incoming dangers such as missiles. Coins {{can also be used}} <b>to</b> <b>bet</b> <b>on</b> the victor of online battles via Spectator mode. Trophies unavailable in Coin Launcher mode are obtained by using an item called the Trophy Stand on weakened enemy characters and bosses within The Subspace Emissary. Trophies obtained in this manner may contain information on the backstory of the Subspace Emissary.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2009 {{legislative}} session, Attorney General Jack Conway {{was asked}} to issue advisory opinions on two gambling-related issues. Republican state senator Damon Thayer asked for an opinion as to whether Instant Racing – allowing individuals <b>to</b> <b>bet</b> <b>on</b> the outcome of previously run horse races – would be allowable under the state constitution. Democratic Representative Jody Richards also asked for an advisory opinion as to whether a constitutional amendment was required to allow video lottery terminals at the state's racetracks or whether they {{could be construed as}} legal under the amendment that allowed a state lottery. Critics charged that Conway had a conflict of interest in the matter because his father {{was a member of the}} Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, but Conway denied that a conflict existed, and the state Executive Branch Ethics Board refused to take a position unless an official request for an investigation were made. Conway subsequently opined in June 2009 that video lottery terminals would be legal if governed by the Kentucky Lottery Corporation and in January 2010 that instant racing would be allowable under the state's parimutuel betting statutes with a few regulatory changes.|$|E
25|$|Optimism/Desirability Bias. Gamblers also exhibit optimism, overestimating the {{likelihood}} that desired events will occur.

25|$|Other gambling: Money {{is spent}} on gambling, preferably on high odds games. One way to {{minimize}} risk with this method is <b>to</b> <b>bet</b> <b>on</b> every possible outcome of some event that has many possible outcomes, so no outcome(s) have short odds, and the bettor will lose only the vigorish and will have one or more winning bets that can be shown {{as the source of}} money.

25|$|The {{industry}} of greyhound racing was particularly attractive to predominantly male working-class audiences, {{for whom the}} urban locations of the tracks and the evening times of the meetings were accessible, and to patrons and owners from various social backgrounds.

Like horse racing, it is popular <b>to</b> <b>bet</b> <b>on</b> the greyhound races as a form of parimutuel gambling.|$|E

To answer this question, we investigate an agent's preferences over sets of acts. We axiomatize a utility function, through which we can identify the agent's subjective belief that a randomization eliminates the effects of uncertainty...|$|R

25|$|Some of the {{websites}} {{created to}} help with trading of CS:GO skins started offering mechanisms for gambling with skins, appearing to avoid the conflation with real-world currency. These originated as sites that allowed players to use skins <b>to</b> <b>bet</b> <b>on</b> eSport matches; Players would bet one or more skins from their Steam inventory, which are then moved to an account managed by the gambling site. Upon winning, the player would be given back their skins and a distribution of the skins that the losing players had offered.|$|E
25|$|As {{state senator}} she {{introduced}} a bill to eliminate Oregon's Sports Action lottery game.

She also supported legislation to allow patients at the Oregon State Hospital and prisoners in the corrections system to receive visits from pets. The legislation was introduced in 1983 and would have establish guidelines where inmates and prisoners under certain conditions could receive the visits due to the pets therapeutic benefits.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} the results of an {{experiment}} with a statistical choice task involving the toss of a fair coin. In our experiment participants had to decide whether they were willing to pay a price <b>to</b> switch from <b>betting</b> <b>on</b> the future performance of one player <b>to</b> <b>betting</b> <b>on</b> that of another player. The switch was from a player who had been previously less successful in <b>betting</b> <b>on</b> five coin flips to another one who had been more successful in the same task. We conducted a treatment with the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak mechanism and one in which participants were faced with a fixed price. In both cases, participants exhibit a strong bias towards placing their <b>bets</b> <b>on</b> players with a good guessing history in the coin toss task. Participants’ behavior is compatible with prescriptive luck beliefs, that is, the idea that luck is a somehow deterministic and personal attribute...|$|R
25|$|The Baby Race {{started in}} series 4 and {{continued}} through to series 5. In the game, six babies {{and their parents}} were brought into the studio. Each parent sat {{at one end of}} a mat and the first baby to get from one parent to the other was the winner. Usually the parent on the far side held an object or toy that the baby liked, or found interesting. The race was treated much like a horse race (to get points the Bungalow Heads had <b>to</b> <b>bet</b> <b>on</b> which baby they thought would win) up to and including the humorous commentary where other 'race tracks' are referred to as if baby racing was a popular sport.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the Arms Deal update in August 2013, skins formed a virtual economy due to their rarity and other high-value factors that influenced their desirability. Due to this, the creation of a number of skin trading sites enabled by the Steamworks API were created. Some of these sites began to offer gambling functionality, allowing users <b>to</b> <b>bet</b> <b>on</b> the outcome of professional matches with skins. In June and July 2016, two formal lawsuits were filed against these gambling sites and Valve, stating that these encourage underage gambling and undisclosed promotion by some streamers. Valve in turn began to take steps to prevent these sites from using Steamworks for gambling purposes, and several of these sites ceased operating as a result.|$|E
25|$|It was in {{this climate}} that Matthew Barnett formed a {{partnership}} 'Barnett and Grant'. It came about because Peter Grant had been banned from a racecourse for refusing to leave. Barnett, who had earlier been banned from the same course for life, but who {{had managed to get}} that decision overturned, offered to Grant <b>to</b> <b>bet</b> <b>on</b> a joint account. A win of £100 resulted and although the two never formalised their partnership, their further wins in this first year ran into the thousands. Luck left them, and after the second year they had lost all their earnings again. Luck was with them again, and some time after Grant's wedding in February 1896, they had sufficient capital to add a branch in Christchurch to their existing betting shop in Dunedin. Initially, the Dunedin business had to financially support the Christchurch branch, but under Barnett's business leadership in Christchurch, the situation changed and Christchurch supported the Dunedin branch. The Christchurch premises were in the central city at 174 Hereford Street, and from 1905 {{on the opposite side of}} the road at 163 Hereford Street.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} options for how {{insurance}} {{could be used}} in responding to climate change (Arrow et al., 1996, p.72).

This would be a type of mutual insurance contract. Another approach would be to trade [...] "risk securities" [...] among countries.
