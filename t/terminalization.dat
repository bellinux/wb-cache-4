40|$|In {{this paper}} we define and study {{triangulated}} categories {{in which the}} Homspaces have Krull dimension at most one over some base ring (hence they have a natural 2 -step filtration), and each factor of the filtration satisfies some Calabi–Yau type property. If C is such a category, we say that C is Calabi–Yau with dim C ≤ 1. We extend the notion of Calabi–Yau reduction to this setting, and prove general results which are an analogue of known results in cluster theory. Such categories appear naturally {{in the setting of}} Gorenstein singularities in dimension three as the stable categories CM R of Cohen–Macaulay modules. We explain the connection between Calabi–Yau reduction of CM R and both partial crepant resolutions and Q-factorial <b>terminalizations</b> of Spec R, and we show under quite general assumptions that Calabi–Yau reductions exist. In the remainder of the paper we focus on complete local cAn singularities R. By using a purely algebraic argument based on Calabi–Yau reduction of CM R, we give a complete classification of maximal modifying modules in terms of the symmetric group, generalizing and strengthening results in [7, 10], where we do not need any restriction on the ground field.

Chiasmata frequencies per nucleus/bivalent were analyzed at diplotene and diakinesis revealing a marked reduction of chiasmata at diakinesis as compared to diplotene. The very low <b>terminalization</b> value of 0. 43 showed that most of the chiasmata were terminalized at diakinesis and metaphase I. Multivalent associations were frequent suggesting the presence of a translocation heterozygote. Univalents were also of a frequent occurrence.

40|$|Two T 7 OH/+ translocation-carrying male mice {{were used}} in an {{investigation}} into the relation between the segregation pattern of the translocation caused multivalent at anaphase I and the position of the only chiasma in a long interstitial segment. Moreover, the relation between meiotic stage (from early diakinesis to metaphase I) and chiasma movement was assessed. It appeared that pronounced movement of a chiasma within the multivalent was linked with chiasma <b>terminalization</b> in an adjacent segment, either {{on the same side of}} the translocation breakpoint or on the other side. On summing the CIV and CIII+I configurations (making up 97. 9 % of all configurations found) and focusing on the multivalents from late meiotic cells, 41. 3 % had a proximal chiasma in the long interstitial segment of the multivalent.

We have focused our analysis on chromosome 3, which shows a large distal heterochromatic band {{at one of the}} ends of both homologues. At metaphase I, and indepen-dently of the chiasma position, two alternative orien-tations have been observed: either the hetero-chromatic or the euchromatic ends of both homolo-gues are directed to opposite poles. At anaphase I, the kinetic activity is restricted to the same chromosome end (euchromatic or heterochromatic) of each homo-logue. The frequencies of these two alternatives are not random and differ significantly among the five individuals analysed. However, the euchromatic ends present kinetic activity at a higher frequency than the heterochromatic ends. At metaphase II, half-bivalents also show the kinetic activity restricted to either of the chromosome ends (euchromatic or heterochromatic). The frequencies of each alternative are inverted in anaphase II compared with those scored in anaphase I. Accordingly, those ends that present kinetic activity at anaphase I segregate reductionally during the first meiotic division and equationally during the second meiotic division.

The present study stemmed from an unexpected result of these crosses. Evidence for a centromeric effect on NRD was obtained, suggested by a negative correlation between the degree of NRD, c, and {{the distance between the}} region of exchange and the centromere as inferred from SET's (single exchange tetrads). Studies on sex chromosome systems other than FR 1 confirmed these results. An analogous centromeric effect on preferential segregation had been clearly demonstrated in maize (Kikudome 1958, 1959; Rhoades and Dempsey 1966). However, prior to the present investigation, no such effect of the centromere on NRD in Drosophila had been described, although reanalysis of part of the data of Novitski (1951) and Novitski and Sandler (1956) suggests some evidence of a seriation of increasing c values extending from the most distal region of the chromosome toward the centromere. A suggestion that the effect in Drosophila may be related in some way to the time required for chiasma <b>terminalization,</b> i. e., those terminalizing earlier (distally located crossovers) permitting more random disjunction of the chromatids from the asymmetric dyad and those terminalizing later, progressively less random, is considered and rejected since in general the expected pattern of c values for the various double exchange tetrads (DET's) is inconsistent with that prediction and provides evidence suggesting the possibility of reversals, in part, of c values obtained for SET's...|$|E
40|$|Translocations {{have long}} been valued for their segregational properties. This paper extends the utility of translocations by {{considering}} recombinational derivatives of pairs of simple reciprocal translocations. Three major derivative structures are noted. One of these derivatives is suitable for use in half-tetrad experiments. A second should find use in recombining markers with translocation breakpoints. The third is an insertional-tandem duplication: it has a section of one chromosome inserted into a heterologue with {{a section of the}} latter chromosome tandemly repeated about the breaks of the insert. All of these structures are contained in "constellations" of chromosomes that regularly segregate aneuploid- 1 products (informationally equivalent to nonrecombinant adjacent- 1 segregants) for one of the parental translocations but do not segregate euploid products. This is in contrast to the parental T 1 /T 2 constellations which segregate euploid products but not aneuploid- 1 products. Methods are described for selecting translocation recombinants {{on the basis of this}} dichotomy. Several examples of translocation recombinants have been recovered with these techniques, and the recombination frequencies seem to be consistent with those observed for crossovers between inversion breakpoints. Recombinant chromosomes tend to disjoin, but it is observed that the tendency may vary according to the region involved in the recombination, and it is suggested that this difference reflects a difference in chiasmata <b>terminalization</b> times. Special consideration is given to insertional-tandem duplications. Large insertional-tandem duplications are useful in cytogenetic screens. Small insertional-tandem duplications are useful in gene dosage studies and other experiments that require an insert from one chromosome to another. Large duplications can be deleted to form small duplications. To generate a small insert for a specified region, it is only necessary to have one translocation with a breakpoint flanking the region of interest. The second translocation can have a breakpoint quite far from the region: an insertional-tandem duplication containing the region that has one closely flanking breakpoint can be deleted to create a smaller duplication that has two closely flanking breakpoints...|$|E
40|$|Recombination was {{investigated}} within the Nor-B 2 locus of wheat chromosome 6 B that contains several thousand of the 18 S- 5. 8 S- 26 S rRNA (rDNA) repeated units. Additionally, recombination was assessed for several chromosome regions, in arm 6 Bq between the centromere and the B 2 locus (awn suppressor) and in arm 6 Bp between the centromere and Nor-B 2, between Nor-B 2 and a distal C-band and between Nor-B 2 and Gli-B 2 coding for gliadins. The experimental design permitted {{the distinction between}} crossing over between homologous chromosomes and exchange between sister chromatids. No homologous crossing over within the Nor-B 2 locus {{was found in a}} sample of 446 chromosomes, but one exchange with the attributes of unequal sister chromatid exchange was identified. The molecular characteristics of this presumed sister chromatid exchange indicate that the spacer variants present in the Nor-B 2 locus are clustered. No homologous recombination was detected within the distal Gli-B 2 locus containing repeated genes coding for gliadin seed-storage proteins. Both arms of chromosome 6 B showed low crossing-over frequency in the proximal regions. The distance from the centromere to Nor-B 2 was only from 0. 3 to 2. 2 cM although it accounts for about two-thirds of the metaphase chromosome arm, which shows a great distortion of the metaphase map of the arm. The level of homologous recombination within the Nor-B 2 locus is lower than in the chromosome region immediately distal to it. Whether it is comparable to that in the chromosome region proximal to it could not be determined. Recombination frequencies of different pairs of chromosome 6 B in all but one interval paralleled the frequencies of their metaphase I pairing: Lower pairing at metaphase I was paralleled by lower crossing-over frequency. This relationship indicated that reduced metaphase I pairing between 6 B chromosomes from different populations is due to impaired crossing-over and not due to precocious chiasma <b>terminalization...</b>|$|E
40|$|Poor cell {{survival}} and striatal reinnervation {{are two of}} the postulated limiting factors of fetal ventral mesencephalic (VM) grafting in Parkinson's disease. It has, however, been reported that an increased survival of VM dopaminergic neurons does not correlate with an enhanced target innervation. Instead, the population that was increased in number terminated within the VM graft. In this thesis, different striatal innervation patterns were morphologically and functionally characterized, and traced to VM subpopulations displaying disparate histochemical traits, in order to achieve enhanced striatal reinnervation in volume and density in the rat model for Parkinson's disease. Since immature striatal tissue receives a more pronounced VM-derived innervation, factors associated with striatal immaturity were applied concomitantly with VM grafting by usage of polymeric bioactive rods. Knockout of the orphan nuclear receptor Nurr 1 in mice causes a complete lack of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) -expression in the ventral midbrain and of dopamine (DA) in the striatum. Therefore, Nurr 1 may be implicated {{in the development of the}} nigrostriatal pathway. In vitro cultures of VM tissue from Nurr 1 deficient mice were performed to obliterate putative endogenous inhibitory agents, and hence investigate the possibility of TH-induction. Furthermore, the presence of extra-cellular matrix (ECM) molecules was mapped within intrastriatal VM grafts to study the putative role of the ECM in guidance of dopaminergic outgrowth. The results confirm that striatal tissue, may be targeted by two different innervation patterns with different functional properties. Patchy and dense DAergic outgrowth induced in immature striatal tissue possessed high functional capacity in terms of DA-release, while diffuse growth induced both in immature and mature striatal tissue possessed low functional capacity. Furthermore, it was shown that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), expressed in striatal proliferative zones of the adult brain, improves nerve fiber density both within the striatal target and within the VM graft. Moreover, it was concluded that not all of the DA neurons within a VM graft innervate the striatal target and that the non-projecting neurons might belong to the A 10 subpopulation of VM, based on calbindinD 28 k-immunoreactivity. It was demonstrated that it is possible to induce TH-expressing neurons of Nurr 1 knockout VM tissue in in vitro cultures. These neurons, however, did not possess the capacity to form TH-positive nerve fiber bundles. It was clarified that the ECM molecule keratan sulfate (KS) is differentially expressed in VM grafts depending on the expression of calbindinD 28 k. CalbindinD 28 k-expressing neuronal clusters within VM grafts did not co-express KS, while calbindinD 28 k-negative clusters did. Moreover, tenascin was expressed in calbindinD 28 k- positive cell clusters. In conclusion, the results from this thesis demonstrate that it might be important to induce an immature environment in the host striatum, in order to enhance the VMderived target innervation. Not all TH-expressing neurons within a VM graft have the potency to project to the target, and it was shown that neurons projecting to the striatum were calbindinD 2 ak-negative, indicating A 9 - origin. Nurr 1 does not seem to be absolutely required for induction of a TH-expressing neuronal phenotype. However, Nurr 1 is a prerequisite for the formation of nerve fiber bundles, indicating a malfunction of the induction of a nigrostriatal connection in Nurr 1 knockout animals. KS seems to act as an attractant on dopaminergic outgrowth from VM grafts, and might be implicated in the guidance of the nigrostriatal pathway during development. Tenascin, on the contrary may hinder the outgrowth and instead cause <b>terminalization</b> within the transplant...|$|E
40|$|In this section, {{the order}} of the {{articles}} has not been closely followed. Each point ends with the number(s) of the article(s) (as given in the contents), where the conclusion is based on. 1) Cytological meiotic studies of T(2; 8) 26 H and T(1; 13) 70 H heterozygotes and Ts(1 13 ) 70 H tertiary trisomics indicate, that chiasmata are more often located in the distal (translocated) segments than in the proximal (interstitial) segments containing centric heterochromatin (3 and 5). 2) This study opens the possibility that the presence of centric heterochromatin decreases the probability of chiasma formation in its vicinity with a positive gradient distally (5). 3) The genetic lengths of the interstitial and translocated chromosome segments coincide rather well with the physical length of these segments as estimated with the aid of Giemsa-banding. This finding does not fit the tendency expressed in the conclusions 1 and 2. The apparent exception of this rule is segment 13 t which is overestimated when looking at genetic recombination. For cytological studies, the physical length of a segment is of a greater value (4). 4) Univalence for chromosome 1 13 at metaphase I - anaphase I does not lead to an appreciable loss of this chromosome in the male, neither in the Ts(1 13 ) 70 H tertiary trisomic karyotype nor in the T(1; 13) 70 H heterozygote (3 and 5). 5) In the T 70 H/+ karyotype, there is strong evidence for coorientation of the 1 13 univalent so that the four reciprocal translocation involved chromosomes segregate two by two. Occasionally, equational separation of the two 1 13 chromatids may occur at anaphase I (5). 6) The segregational behavior of heterozygous translocation multivalent configurations can, within the genetic background concerned, be best explained by time differences of chiasma <b>terminalization</b> during metaphase I - anaphase 1 (5). 7) The genetic background most likely exerts an influence on the behavior of mouse reciprocal translocations (5). 8) The reliability of the formula which relates the summed frequencies of adjacent II disjunction and numerical non- disjunction and the relative viability of heterozygous translocation outcross progeny depends on the existence of selection against small litters during gestation. This is the more likely when the theoretically expected litter size decreases (5). 9) A-chiasmate non-homologous chromosome association of the centric heterochromatin of chromosome 1 13 and the X-chromosome does occur (3 and 5). 10) The majority of male Ts(1 13 ) 70 H tertiary trisomics are capable of producing offspring. Thus, tertiary trisomy does not invariably lead to sterility in the male mouse (2 and 3). 11) Tertiary trisomics for chromosome 1 13 in the mouse display a variety of phenotypes. The condition can lead to death in utero, to death before weaning, to morphologically affected but viable animals and to animals with an unaltered appearance (2 and 3). 12) The ratio between morphologically affected and unaffected tertiary trisomics for chromosome 1 13 at birth (live or dead) amounts to between 2 and 3. This ratio might depend on the genetic background concerned (2 and 3). 13) The most obvious abnormality of the morphologically affected tertiary trisomics of the Ts(1 13 ) 70 H karyotype is a malformation of the bones of the skull which often leads to an abnormal growth of the upper and lower incisors (2). 14) The impaired fertility of Ts(1 13 ) 70 H males is most probably due to a lowered production of functional spermatozoa and the consequences this has for the continuation of pregnancy. Thus, the elimination of "unbalanced" progeny is not the first cause (3) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a start {{was made with}} meiotic {{observations}} of mouse translocation types - a Robertsonian translocation and a translocation between a metacentric and an acrocentric chromosome - which also occur in man. It is generally accepted that, when no chromosomal rearrangements are involved, man shows {{a higher level of}} non-disjunction than the mouse. When the meiotic behaviour of translocations in mouse and man would be more similar than that found for the autosomal bivalents (and sex bivalent) of these species Chapter 1 reviews the methodology to establish this difference mouse systems characterized by chromosome aberrations would become more attractive as models for the study of endogeneous and exogeneous factors on the meiotic process and extrapolation from mouse to man would be facilitated. As it appeared in these studies that not only the translocation complex but also the normal bivalents contribute to a significant extent to the non-disjunction rates in the heterozygote for a translocation of the meta/acro type, this material appeared even more favourable as an experimental substitute for man than was initially expected. Meiosis in male mice, heterozygous for the Robertsonian translocation Rb(11. 13) 4 Bnr, has been studied in an attempt to elucidate the mechanism(s) of non-disjunction for the trivalent formed at meiosis I by the Rb chromosome and the two acrocentric homologues 11 and 13 (Chapters 2 and 3). As an exogeneous factor of possible influence, the meiotic effects of two types of radiation, administered at relatively low doses 2 and 3 hours before prometaphase-metaphase II (probably during metaphase-anaphase I), were determined in Rb 4 Bnr/+-males (Chapter 3). The segregational behaviour of the multivalent at anaphase I has been compared in T(1; 11. 13 S),+/+,RBnr, structurally homozygous for the metacentric Rb(11. 13) 4 Bnr chromosome whereby arm 13 of one of the two metacentrics is involved in a reciprocal translocation with the acrocentric chromosome 1, and T(I 113) 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr (Chapter 4). The multivalents formed by the latter karyotype at meiosis I are highly comparable to those of the former one; for details see section III below. The results obtained, and presented below, warrant a further investigation of these mouse meiotic systems as models for the situation in man as is for example indicated by the significant increase of normal bivalent non-disjunction found in the T(1; 11. 3 S),+/+,Rb 4 Bnr and the T 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr karyotypes. In the next sections the chapters on which the conclusions are based, have been indicated between parentheses. I Indications for the relation between delay before and around anaphase I and non-disjunction in male Rb 4 Bnr Robertsonian translocation heterozygotes- For Rb 4 Bnr/+ males, inter mouse variation was noted with respect to the duration of the meiotic prophase, i. e. the period "end of the premeiotic S phase-metaphase V'. This was concluded {{on the basis of the}} frequency of late diplotene/metaphase I cells with labelled chromosomes recorded autoradiographically in mice killed various time intervals after the i. p. administered injection with 3 H-thymidine (3). - For Rb 4 Bnr/+ males, compared to their +/+ controls, a greater mean number of late diplotene/metaphase 1 cells was counted in the separate groups along the seminiferous epithelium, whereas the mean distance between the subsequent groups was smaller. As these data are in contradiction with the reduction by 58 % of the epidydimal sperm count for Rb 4 Bnr/+ compared to +/+, the greater number was thought to be an accumulation effect due to delay during diplotene/metaphase I for at least a fraction of the cells. Implicitly a causal relation between delay and cell death before the spermatozoal stage is also suggested (2). - The duration of the period "end meiosis I (metaphase I) - end meiosis II'' was approached autoradiographically for Rb 4 Bnr/+-males with the aid of cells showing a labelled Y chromosome only. The best assessment of the duration of this period was 3 hours or less. Inter mouse variation with respect to the duration of the period "end of the premeiotic S phase-metaphase ill (see above) prevented a more accurate estimate (3). - Irradiation of Rb 4 Bnr/+ males for 14. 5 minutes with a dose of 15. 2 rad fast neutrons (mean energy 1. 7 MeV) significantlydecreased the incidence of ancuploid secondary spermatocytes, scored 2 and 3 hours after application. This was explained by selective cell killing of those cells giving rise to aneuploid daughter cells after anaphase I, rather than by protection against non- disjunction by the irradiation dose, as follows: For Rb 4 Bnr/+ during the final period of the primary spermatocyte stage, cells show a continuous distribution with respect to the extent of delay. Cells with a strong delay will die off before the secondary spermatocyte stage, while the fraction showing only minor delay will survive (in the unirradiated situation) but with an increased risk of producing aneuploid daughter cells. The results suggest that, in terms of cell death, the victims of the 15. 2 rad neutron irradiation predominantly have to be searched in the last category. A causal relation between delay and ensuing non-disjunction at anaphase I, and between delay and the neutron irradiation effect respectively, is thus suggested but the basis for these interactions remains unknown (3). II Irradiation induced damage during meiosis in male Rb 4 Bnr Robertsonian translocation heterozygotes- After irradiation of Rb 4 Bnr/+ male mice for 14. 5 minutes with either a dose of 15. 2 rad neutrons or 60 rad X rays, only neutrons affected, viz. significantly decreased (see above), the incidence of aneuploid secondary spermatocytes estimated 2 and 3 hours after irradiation. The reason for this difference remained unknown and could not be explained on the basis of a difference in the levels of radiation induced damage. The two radiation types induced comparable levels of chromosome damage, i. e. numbers of breaks, fragments and deletions per cell, when compared in either late diplotene/metaphase I or metaphase II cells. For these parameters the neutrons: X ray RBE ratios estimated were 5. 4 for meiosis 1 and 3. 3 for meiosis II cells (3). - After an irradiation-fixation interval of 2 to 3 hours, the chromosome damage (i. e. numbers of breaks, fragments and deletions) induced by either 15. 2 rad neutrons or 60 rad X rays was 5 - 10 times higher when scored in metaphase II than in diakinesis/ metaphase I cells. At the moment of irradiation the two categories of cells were, most probably, at prometaphase/metaphase 1 and late diplotene/early diakinesis, respectively. The difference in chromosome damage was argued to be merely the consequence of differences in chromosomal processes taking place during the irradiation-fixation interval and not a reflection of a difference in radiation sensitivity between the two meiosis I stages (3). III The meiotic behaviour in T(1; 11. 13 S),+/+,Rb 4 Bnr and T 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr male mice, also with reference to the behaviour of the normal bivalentsThe T(1; 11. 13 S),+/+,Rb 4 Bnr karyotype includes the metacentric Rb(11. 13) 4 Bnr chromosome in homozygous condition whereby the 13 arm of one of the metacentrics is involved in a reciprocal translocation with the acrocentric chromosome 1. The T 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr karyotype is double heterozygous for the T(1; 13) 7 OH reciprocal translocation and the metacentric Rb(11. 13) 4 Bnr chromosome. Its multivalent at meiosis I differs from the one in the former karyotype in one respect: The (acrocentric) chromosome 11 is here involved once separately and once as one of the arms of the metacentric, i. e. attached to the 13 arm, whereas in the former karyotype the two chromosomes 11 are involved each in a metacentric. - For the short translocated segment 13 t, in both T(1; 11. 13 S),+/+, Rb 4 Bnr and T 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr males, chiasma <b>terminalization</b> with proceeding meiosis I was observed less frequently compared with T 70 W+. It was argumented that this is probably due to spermatocyte I degeneration taking place to a higher extent in the former two karyotypes as in both, in comparison to T 7 OH/+, a greater frequency of meiosis 1 cells with short contracted bivalents was observed. The latter phenomenon was in an earlier study shown to correlate highly with a decreasing sperm count (4). - In T(1; 11. 13 S),+/+, Rb 4 Bnr a chiasmate association of the long interstitial segment 13 i was absent in 12. 5 % (N= 1000) of the meiosis I cells, but only in 2. 7 % (N= 1000) of these cells in T 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr males. A cause for this discrepancy could not be given the phenomenon could not be contributed to a precocious "disappearance" of the 13 i chiasma - and seems to be an effect of the metacentric chromosome present in homozygous condition in the former karyotype (4). A significant increase of the 3 : 1 segregation of the multivalent chromosomes after anaphase 1 in comparison to T 7 OH/+ (3. 5 %) was found for T(1; 11. 13 S),+/+,Rb 4 Bnr (10. 9 %) but most significantly for T 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr (22. 6 %). In the latter karyotype this refers only to the four chromosomes involved in that part of the multivalent caused by the T 70 H translocation. In T 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr, a preference of the small marker chromosome 1 13 to segregate; with the metacentric Rb 4 Bnr chromosome was indicated and this could be sustained by the high frequency of Ts(1 13 ) 70 H tertiary trisomics among the progeny of males of this karyotype. The results suggest that factors predisposing for 3 : 1 segregation and life expectancy of the tertiary trisomic product produced among the progeny may coincide (4). In T 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr males the alternate and adjacent 1 segregation products could be distinguished at meiosis II and almost equal frequencies were found for both. In the offspring however, karyotypes resulting from adjacent 1 were found more frequently but this disagreement is probably due to the limited sample size of the offspring karyotyped (4). In both T(1; 11. 13 S),+/+,Rb 4 Bnr and T 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr male mice, the normal bivalent non-disjunction after anaphase I appeared to be highly elevated in comparison to +/+ and T 70 H/+ For the former karyotype a correlation was observed, moreover, between nondisjunction for the normal bivalents and adjacent 2 segregation of the multivalent chromosomes. This suggests either an interaction between the two phenomena or, alternatively, their coincidence may be an effect of the general (poor) physiological status of the cells. A sharp distinction between these alternatives cannot be made. The indication of spermatocyte I degeneration (see first point of this section) in both karyotypes puts weight on the latter hypothesis, assuming an interaction between the poorer physiological status of the cell and adjacent 2 /normal bivalent non-disjunction. ...|$|E
