40|$|The basic aspect that is {{the subject}} of {{interest}} in this paper refers to the air traffic management. If it is true that <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> air transport makes a subsystem of air traffic also originating from the general theory of complex systems and the theory <b>of</b> modem management (<b>structuring),</b> then it appears from the theoretical and practical viewpoint possible and correct to decompose this subsystem in to a number of further subsystems of lower hierarchical level. Thus when dealing with the issue of air traffic management it is possible to discuss: <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> air traffic authorities, <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> air traffic as a system, <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> transport service, <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> passenger and freight services, internal <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> airlines, of airports, and <b>of</b> ATC, <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> individual business functions and <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> transport process. </p...|$|R

5|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, prokaryotes were {{regarded}} as a single group of organisms and classified based on their biochemistry, morphology and metabolism. For example, microbiologists tried to classify microorganisms based on <b>the</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> their cell walls, their shapes, and the substances they consume. In 1965, Emile Zuckerkandl and Linus Pauling proposed instead using the sequences of the genes in different prokaryotes to work out how they are related to each other. This approach, known as phylogenetics, is the main method used today.|$|E

5|$|In decavanadate, each V(V) {{center is}} {{surrounded}} by six oxide ligands. Vanadic acid, H3VO4 exists only at very low concentrations because protonation of the tetrahedral species − results in the preferential formation of the octahedral + species. In strongly acidic solutions, pH<2. + is the predominant species, while the oxide V2O5 precipitates from solution at high concentrations. The oxide is formally the inorganic anhydride of vanadic acid. <b>The</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> many vanadate compounds have been determined by X-ray crystallography.|$|E

5|$|A {{competitive}} inhibitor and substrate cannot bind to {{the enzyme}} {{at the same}} time. Often competitive inhibitors strongly resemble the real substrate of the enzyme. For example, the drug methotrexate is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. The similarity between <b>the</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> dihydrofolate and this drug are shown in the accompanying figure. This type of inhibition can be overcome with high substrate concentration. In some cases, the inhibitor can bind to a site other than the binding-site of the usual substrate and exert an allosteric effect to change {{the shape of the}} usual binding-site.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> the BRCA1 and BRCA2 {{genes are}} very different, {{at least some}} {{functions}} are interrelated. The proteins made by both genes are essential for repairing damaged DNA (see Figure of recombinational repair steps). BRCA2 binds the single strand DNA and directly interacts with the recombinase RAD51 to stimulate strand invasion a vital step of homologous recombination. The localization of RAD51 to the DNA double-strand break requires the formation of BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 complex. PALB2 (Partner and localizer of BRCA2) can function synergistically with a BRCA2 chimera (termed piccolo, or piBRCA2) to further promote strand invasion. These breaks {{can be caused by}} natural and medical radiation or other environmental exposures, but also occur when chromosomes exchange genetic material during a special type of cell division that creates sperm and eggs (meiosis). Double strand breaks are also generated during repair of DNA cross links. By repairing DNA, these proteins play a role in maintaining the stability of the human genome and prevent dangerous gene rearrangements that can lead to hematologic and other cancers.|$|E
5|$|Controversy {{regarding}} {{the identity of}} the filaments preserved in the first Sinosauropteryx specimen began almost immediately, as the team of scientists spent three days in Beijing examining the specimen under a microscope. The results of their studies (reported during a press conference at the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences on Thursday, April 24, 1997) were inconclusive; the team agreed that the structures preserved on Sinosauropteryx were not modern feathers, but suggested further research was required to discover their exact nature. Palaeontologist Alan Feduccia, who had not yet examined the specimen, wrote in Audubon Magazine that <b>the</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> Sinosauropteryx (which he considered at the time to be a synonym of Compsognathus, as Compsognathus prima) were stiffening structures from a frill running along the back, and that dinosaur palaeontologists were engaging in wishful thinking when equating the structures with feathers. Subsequent publications saw some of the team members disagreeing over {{the identity of the}} structures.|$|E
