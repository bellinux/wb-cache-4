500|$|The Mac Pro {{is in the}} Unix {{workstation}} market. Although {{the high-end}} technical market has not traditionally been an area of strength for Apple, {{the company has been}} positioning itself as a leader in non-linear digital editing for high-definition video, which demands storage and memory far in excess of a general desktop machine. Additionally, the codecs used in these applications are generally processor intensive and highly <b>threadable,</b> which Apple's ProRes white paper describes as scaling almost linearly with additional processor cores. Apple's previous machine aimed at this market, the Power Mac G5, has up to two dual-core processors (marketed as [...] "Quad-Core"), but lacks the storage expansion capabilities of the newer design.|$|E
5000|$|Apple {{stated that}} an Intel-based {{replacement}} for the PowerPC-based Power Mac G5 machines had been expected for some time before the Mac Pro was formally announced on August 7, 2006 at the annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). The iMac, Mac Mini, MacBook, and MacBook Pro had moved to an Intel-based architecture starting in January 2006, leaving the Power Mac G5 as the only machine in the Mac lineup still based on the PowerPC processor architecture Apple had used since 1993. Apple had dropped the term [...] "Power" [...] from the other machines in their lineup, and started using [...] "Pro" [...] on their higher-end laptop offerings. As such, the name [...] "Mac Pro" [...] was widely used before the machine was announced.The Mac Pro is in the Unix workstation market.

40|$|A {{new device}} called a maze {{recognizing}} automaton is introduced. The following two statements are {{shown to be}} equivalent. (i) There is a maze recognizing automaton that accepts precisely the <b>threadable</b> mazes. (ii) Every nondeterministic L(n) -tape bounded Turing machine can be simulated by a deterministic L(n) -tape bounded Turing machine, provided L(n) ≥log 2 n...|$|E
40|$|A {{saddle clamp}} {{assembly}} is presented. The assembly {{is comprised of}} a hollow cylindrical body centered about a longitudinal axis and being diametrically split into semicircular top and bottom sections. Each section has a pair of connection flanges, at opposite ends, that project radially outward. A pair of bolts are retained on the top section flanges and are <b>threadable</b> into nuts retained on the bottom section flanges. A base member is anchored to a central underside portion of the bottom clamp body section and has a pair of connection tabs positioned beneath the bottom clamp body section connection flanges {{on opposite sides of}} the clamp axis. A pair of bolts are retained on the base member connection tabs and are <b>threadable</b> into a pair of nuts retainable on a support structure. The connection tab and connection flanges on each side of the clamp body are axially offset in a manner permitting downward installation/removable tool access to the lower bolts past the connection flanges. An elongated retention tether is used to connect the top clamp body section to the balance of the clamp assembly. This prevents loss of the top clamp body section when it is removed from the bottom clamp body section...|$|E
40|$|The {{amount of}} storage needed to {{simulate}} a nondeterministic tape bounded Turingmachine on a deterministic Turing machine is investigated. Results include the following: Theorem. A nondeterministic L(n) -tape bounded Turing machine can be simulated by a deterministic [L(n) ] 2 -tape bounded Turing machine, provided L(n) ≥log 2 n. Computations of nondeterministic machines are shown {{to correspond to}} threadings of certain mazes. This correspondence is used to produce a specific set, namely the set of all codings of <b>threadable</b> mazes, such that, {{if there is any}} set which distinguishes nondeterministic tape complexity classes from deterministic tape complexity classes, then this is one such set...|$|E
40|$|DE 19809675 C UPAB: 19991221 NOVELTY - The {{apparatus}} incorporates filaments (30), clamping units (10, 20) for the filaments, and adjustable holding devices (40) for {{the hollow}} components (50). One (10) of the clamping units is positionally fixed, {{while the other}} (20) is movable relative to it. The hollow components are <b>threadable</b> onto the filaments. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for carrying out the above method which includes the following steps: (a) the filaments (30) are positioned parallel and clamped at their ends; (b) they are carburized if necessary and then released from their clamps; (c) the hollow components (50) are threaded and aligned onto the filaments; (d) the latter are clamped anew and connected to an electricity supply; and (e) they are heated while a gas is supplied at the same time. As a result, the component inner surfaces (51) become uniformly diamond coated. USE - For production of tubular components applicable as grinding elements. ADVANTAGE - The coating is hard and highly uniform over {{the entire length of}} the tubular component. It is of such a quality that subsequent grinding or some other mechanical process on it is unnecessary...|$|E
