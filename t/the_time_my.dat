2500|$|Survival was a moral {{as well as}} a {{physical}} struggle. A woman doctor wrote to a friend in June 1933 that she had not yet become a cannibal, but was [...] "not sure that I shall not be one by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>my</b> letter reaches you." [...] The good people died first. Those who refused to steal or to prostitute themselves died. Those who gave food to others died. Those who refused to eat corpses died. Those who refused to kill their fellow man died.... At least 2,505 people were sentenced for cannibalism in the years 1932 and 1933 in Ukraine, though the actual number of cases was certainly much higher.|$|E
2500|$|The {{play has}} also been {{analysed}} {{as part of the}} theatre of the absurd. In a 1984 article, Archie J. Loss argues that nothing can ever happen in the relationship of Elyot and Amanda, because it is based on conflicting emotions: [...] "they are bound to repeat themselves, playing out their scene again and again with different words and different props but always with the same result." [...] In [...] a 2000 study of Coward, Jean Chothia instances surreal exchanges in the play, such as: [...] "Have you ever crossed the Sahara on a camel?" [...] "Frequently. When I was a boy we used to do it all <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>My</b> Grandmother had a wonderful seat on a camel." ...|$|E

2500|$|She, her {{mother-in-law}} and her eldest daughter, {{at the time}} a baby, were captured. Thinking her piano was a radio for communicating with French colonialists, the Viet Minh blew it up and then exiled her to a remote village for four months, where she lived on two bowls of rice a day. The French dismissed Nhu from his post at the National Library due to his brother (Diệm)'s nationalist activities, and he moved to Đà Lạt and lived comfortably, editing a newspaper, where his wife bore three more children. The French war in Vietnam made little impression on Madame Nhu from her home in Đà Lạt, and she often called the war une guerre bizardouille (a bizarre little war) as the fighting never affected her personally. Nhu was during these years building a secret political party called the Can Lao (Personalist Labour Party) based on the Catholic philosophy of personalism (people were persons, not individuals) while Madame Nhu later saying [...] "I was alone most of <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>My</b> husband would simply disappear without a word". To improve her husband's career, Madame Nhu befriended her cousin, the Emperor Bai Dao during this time.|$|E
2500|$|Felix responded on 27 November 1916: [...] "Your {{presence}} by {{the middle}} of December is essential. The plan I'm writing you about has been worked out in detail and is three quarters done, and only the finale is left, and for that your arrival is awaited. It (the murder) is the only way of saving a situation that is almost hopeless.... You will serve as the lure.... Of course, not a word to anyone." [...] A frightened Irina suddenly backed out of the plan on 3 December 1916: [...] "I know that if I come, I shall certainly get sick... You don't know how things are with me. I want to cry all <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>My</b> mood is terrible. I've never had one like it before... I don't know myself what's happening to me. Don't drag me to Petrograd. Come down here instead. Forgive me, my dear one, for writing such things to you. But I can't go on any more, I don't know what's the matter with me. Neurasthenia, I think. Don't be angry with me, please don't be angry. I love you terribly. I can't live without you. May the Lord protect you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Matthew James [...] "Matt" [...] Prior (born 26 February 1982) is {{a former}} English {{international}} cricketer who played for England in Test cricket and for Sussex in domestic cricket. He was a wicket-keeper, and his aggressive right-handed batting enabled him to open the innings in ODI matches, even when he made very limited appearance in shorter forms of the game. With an international Test debut score of 126, Prior became the first English wicket-keeper to hit a century in his debut match in early 2007. His glovework, however, was criticised. Despite a successful tour of Sri Lanka with the bat, Prior's keeping was less successful, and he was dropped from the team for the 2008 tour of New Zealand. He returned for the 2008 series against South Africa, and was retained into 2009, where he became the second-fastest England keeper to reach 1,000 Test runs, behind Les Ames. In his role as wicketkeeper, Prior {{has been described as}} 'a big talker behind the stumps' but has argued that this approach is different from the behaviour that saw him criticised during the 2007 tour by India; 'Ninety-five percent of <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>my</b> chat is about geeing up our bowlers and the fielding unit.' He retired in June 2015 from all forms of professional cricket due to a recurring Achilles tendon injury.|$|E
