5|$|In 1930, the Society for Research in Chinese Architecture began {{a search}} in China for ancient buildings. In the seventh {{year of the}} society's search in 1937, an {{architectural}} team led by Liang Sicheng discovered that Foguang Temple was {{a relic of the}} Tang Dynasty. Liang was able to date the building after his wife found an inscription on one of <b>the</b> <b>rafters.</b> The date's accuracy was confirmed by Liang's study of the building which matched with known information about Tang buildings.|$|E
50|$|By looping more ropes around more pulleys we can {{construct}} a {{block and tackle}} to continue to increase the mechanical advantage. For example, if we have two pulleys attached to <b>the</b> <b>rafter,</b> two pulleys attached to the weight, one end attached to <b>the</b> <b>rafter,</b> and someone standing on <b>the</b> <b>rafter</b> pulling <b>the</b> rope, we have a mechanical advantage of four. Again note: if we add another pulley so that someone may stand {{on the ground and}} pull down, we still have a mechanical advantage of four.|$|R

50|$|The rafts were 23 metres {{long and}} 3 metres wide. One feature were the rounded willow hoops at the front, the {{so-called}} hand rails (Handregels), which <b>the</b> <b>rafter</b> could grab in an emergency. <b>The</b> <b>rafter</b> carried a pole (Schufstaken or Schufboom) for manoeuvering the raft which he {{pressed against the}} left shoulder with a T handle. It was fitted with an iron spike and hook at the end.|$|R

5|$|Cousy {{then became}} a {{broadcaster}} for Celtics games. Upon his election to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1971 the Celtics retired his #14 jersey and hung it in <b>the</b> <b>rafters</b> of the Garden.

He was also the first president of National Basketball Players Association.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{promoted}} as ideal for lake-fishing and duck-shooting, and being {{exhibited in the}} Great Exhibition of 1851, Halkett's boat designs were not commercially successful and never entered general use outside the specialised field of Canadian exploration. Later promoted to Captain, Halkett died on 23 March 1885, aged 65, and the manufacture of his boat designs was abandoned. John Rae gave his boat from the 1853 expedition to a Miss Peace of Kirkwall, and it lay forgotten on <b>the</b> <b>rafters</b> of a Kirkwall woodyard. It was identified and recovered many years later, and is now displayed in the Stromness Museum at Orkney. A second surviving example is held in the Hudson's Bay Company Museum Collection at the Manitoba Museum.|$|E
5|$|In the 1962–63 NBA season, Baylor {{was back}} full-time. West {{averaged}} 27.8points, 7.0rebounds and 5.6assists and was again NBA All-Star and All-NBA First-Team; however, {{he played in}} only 55 regular season games, missing the last seven weeks due to a hamstring injury. Again, the Lakers reached the finals, and again, they battled the Celtics. With West not yet in shape, Baylor and the Lakers fell back 3–2; then they succumbed in Game 6 {{in front of their}} home crowd with a 112–109 loss. As the game ended, veteran Celtics playmaker Bob Cousy threw the ball high into <b>the</b> <b>rafters</b> of the L.A. Sports Arena.|$|E

5000|$|In light frame construction, a {{birdsmouth}} joint or bird's beak cut is a woodworking joint that {{is generally}} used to connect a roof <b>rafter</b> to <b>the</b> top plate of a supporting wall. It is an indentation cut into <b>the</b> <b>rafter</b> {{which consists of}} a [...] "seat cut" [...] (the face of which rests on the top plate) and a [...] "heel cut" [...] or [...] "plumb cut" [...] (the face of which lies parallel to the supporting wall), forming a shape resembling a bird's mouth. The indentation should not extend unsupported on the interior {{in order to maintain}} the structural integrity of <b>the</b> <b>rafter</b> because <b>the</b> unsupported section can split along the grain of the wood. The joint is generally fastened with nails by toenailing <b>the</b> <b>rafter</b> from <b>the</b> side into the top plate below.|$|R

5|$|The gun gallery was {{situated}} in the Recreation Yard and mounted {{on one of the}} dining hall's exterior walls. There was a metal detector outside of the dining hall for security purposes. The dining hall had tear-gas canisters attached to <b>the</b> <b>rafters</b> of the ceiling which could be activated by remote control, should prisoners riot or attempt to escape. The first warden, James A. Johnston, always entered the dining hall alone and unarmed, due to heavy guarding around him. Several riots did break out in the dining hall during Alcatraz's history. Those prisoners who were not involved in the fighting hid under the dining hall tables to escape possible gunfire.|$|E
5|$|Jean Beliveau's number 4 was {{retired in}} 1971 {{after he left}} the game as the all-time leading scorer in Stanley Cup playoff history. Beliveau was offered, but declined, the {{position}} of Governor General of Canada in 1994; he is the only hockey player known to have been asked to serve in this capacity. Guy Lafleur's number 10 followed in February 1985 after his first retirement. Lafleur was a six-time All-Star with the Canadiens, and won three scoring titles and two most valuable player awards. Also in 1985, Doug Harvey's number 2 was raised to <b>the</b> <b>rafters.</b> The defenceman won six Norris Trophies as the NHL's top defenceman in seven years between 1955 and 1961. Jacques Plante's number 1 was retired on October 17, 1995. Plante revolutionized the way goaltenders played the game, and he leads the Canadiens with 314career wins.|$|E
5|$|Scully and Doggett {{arrive at}} the crime scene in Idaho and meet Detective Yale Abbott. He says they are less sure that the bites were made by a human and draws their {{attention}} to the strange footprint, believing that wild animals fed on the bodies after the fact. Scully points out {{that there is only one}} footprint, which looks ominously human, and that if it were left by an animal there would be more footprints leading to the bodies. Scully and Doggett check out the house and find prints leading upstairs and into the attic. Inside, Scully and Doggett find the missing fingers of the undertaker. They look like they have been regurgitated by something and the claw marks in the attic suggest something was hanging from <b>the</b> <b>rafters.</b> Meanwhile, elderly Mrs. McKesson is killed in her attic while looking at a photo album.|$|E

50|$|Lacking a tie beam, the arch-braced (arched brace) truss gives a {{more open}} look to the {{interior}} of the roof. <b>The</b> principal <b>rafters</b> are linked by a collar beam supported by a pair of arch braces, which stiffen the structure and help to transmit the weight of the roof down through <b>the</b> principal <b>rafters</b> to <b>the</b> supporting wall. A double arch braced truss has a second pair of arched braces lower down, from <b>the</b> <b>rafter</b> to a block or inner sill: This form is called a wagon, cradle, barrel or tunnel roof because of this cylindrical appearance.|$|R
5|$|The film's {{special effects}} were {{supervised}} by RKO department head Vernon L. Walker. Welles pioneered several visual effects to cheaply shoot things like crowd scenes and large interior spaces. For example, {{the scene in}} which the camera in the opera house rises dramatically to <b>the</b> <b>rafters,</b> to show the workmen showing a lack of appreciation for Susan Alexander Kane's performance, was shot by a camera craning upwards over the performance scene, then a curtain wipe to a miniature of the upper regions of the house, and then another curtain wipe matching it again with {{the scene of the}} workmen. Other scenes effectively employed miniatures to make the film look much more expensive than it truly was, such as various shots of Xanadu.|$|E
5|$|The hobo's third tale {{tells the}} story of Tom Sawyer, whom Bart portrays, and Huckleberry Finn, whom Nelson portrays. Tom is a rebellious trouble maker while Huck is a bully. Huck is caught holding hands with Becky (Lisa) and is forced to marry her by her father (Homer). Huck dodges the {{marriage}} and goes on the run with Tom, leaving Missouri for Missoura. However, they are chased by townspeople led by Becky's father and their families. Huck and Tom flee to a river boat, but are thrown into the Mississippi River and are caught by the townspeople. At their funeral, Tom and Huck are first revealed to not be in their caskets, seemingly watching the proceedings from <b>the</b> <b>rafters</b> which they have big smiles on their faces, until Reverend Lovejoy orders their bodies lowered into the caskets, revealing that Tom and Huck are in fact dead.|$|E
5|$|The main (west) facade has a {{projecting}} {{two and a}} half-story {{gable roof}} section that is three bays wide and two deep. Decorative detail on the exterior includes quoins, the James Gibbs-inspired surround on the main entrance, and the molded surrounds and keystones of the casement windows. In {{the northwest corner of}} the intersection between the building's two sections is a one-story-high, one-bay-square addition with a narrow metal casement window on the west facade and a large double entrance for horses on the north. The building's interior consists of a large riding ring that is open to <b>the</b> <b>rafters,</b> and in the gable-roofed section, there are lockers and changing rooms on the first floor and a multi-purpose room on the second; on one of its walls is a floor-to-ceiling window permitting view of the ring activity below.|$|E
50|$|If a right {{triangle}} has two angles that equal 45° {{then the two}} sides are equidistant. <b>The</b> <b>rafter</b> is <b>the</b> hypotenuse and the legs or catheti of the triangle are the top wall plates of the structure. The side cut is located at the intersection of the given pitch column and the side cut of the hip/valley row. <b>The</b> regular hip/valley <b>rafter</b> runs at a 45° angle to the main roof and the unit of measurement is 16.97 inches of run. Regular hip/valley and jack rafters have different bevel angles within any given pitch and the angle decreases as the pitch increases.The side cut of <b>the</b> hip/valley <b>rafter</b> = (Tangent)(12) = side cut in inches. The side cuts in <b>the</b> <b>rafter</b> table are all in a base 12. The arc tan can be determined from any given pitch. Most power tools and angle measuring devises use 90° as 0° in construction. The complementary angles of the arc tan are used with tools like the speed square.|$|R

5|$|Filming {{moved to}} Atlanta, Georgia {{for the final}} phase. Wenham and his team {{transformed}} a defunct train yard into an abandoned auto plant used by the protagonists as their headquarters. Redesigning the train yard took place over several months. It was required to allow enough space for stunt drivers to drive into the building, {{and it had to}} include an integrated lighting system. The design team removed walls, hauled out old railway cars, suspended rusted car parts and auto-plant car rails, and constructed smaller buildings within the main building to transform the site. With twenty-five pages of script to shoot in a limited time, cinematographer Stephen Windon and his team spent three weeks setting up a series of high-powered, motorized lights in <b>the</b> <b>rafters</b> of the building, that could be controlled remotely to allow lighting to be altered quickly while fully illuminating the set. An exterior scene involving Diesel and Walker attending a car party, involving several high-performance cars, was filmed near the Georgia Dome. The train heist scene was filmed in Rice, California over three weeks.|$|E
5|$|In the 1961–62 NBA season, {{the aging}} Cousy {{slowly began to}} fade statistically, {{averaging}} 15.7 points, 3.5 rebounds and 7.8 assists, and was voted into the All-NBA Second Team after ten consecutive First Team nominations. Still, he enjoyed a satisfying postseason, winning the 1962 NBA Finals after 4–3 battles against two upcoming teams, the Philadelphia Warriors and Los Angeles Lakers. The Finals series against the Lakers was especially dramatic, because Lakers guard Frank Selvy failed to make a last-second buzzer beater in Game 7 which would have won the title. Finally, in the 1962–63 NBA season, {{the last of his}} career, Cousy averaged 13.2 points, 2.5 rebounds and 6.8 assists, and collected one last All-Star and All-NBA Second Team nomination. In the 1963 NBA Finals, the Celtics again won 4–2 against the Lakers, and Cousy finished his career on a high note: {{in the fourth quarter of}} Game 6, Cousy sprained an ankle and had to be helped to the bench. He went back in with Boston up 1. Although he did not score again, his was credited with providing an emotional lift that carried the Celtics to victory, 112–109. The game ended with Cousy throwing the ball into <b>the</b> <b>rafters.</b>|$|E
5|$|Zen-Yi recovers {{and joins}} Jack and the {{blacksmith}}. Meanwhile, Blossom offers to let Silver hide {{the gold in}} a secret tomb beneath the brothel in return for payment. The gold is stored in a coffin which is raised up to <b>the</b> <b>rafters.</b> That night, Blossom has her girls serve the Lions, and Silk serves Brass. At Blossom's signal, the girls use weapons hidden in their mouths to poison many of the Lions, and they join with Blossom as the Black Widows. When Silk tries to poison Brass, his skin protects him, and he beats and almost kills her. Zen-Yi, Jack, and the blacksmith arrive and join with the Black Widows to fight the remaining Lions while Blossom and Bronze fight and kill each other. While fighting Jack, Poison Dagger is crushed between large moving gears. Silver and Zen-Yi fight in the tomb; Zen-Yi cuts the coffin free, and it crushes Silver. The blacksmith finds Silk, who dies in his arms. He confronts Brass, and his iron fists prove capable of inflicting damage on Brass' seemingly invincible body. While Brass is in metal form, a powerful punch from the blacksmith shatters him to pieces. Jack runs outside in time to stop the soldiers from decimating the building with Gatling guns.|$|E
