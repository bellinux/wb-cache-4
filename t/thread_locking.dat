In general, thermal stability, radiation hardness, outgassing, and material compatibility of the selected organics have been systematically evaluated while their process and fabrication conditions and procedures were being optimized.

30|$|The {{parallel}} algorithm of encoder {{is designed}} {{in such a}} way that each thread is independent and all the threads continue their execution by checking the status of the reference flag. All the threads can be independently executed without sharing of the cores by the threads. So, no data race condition occurs, and this will not incur any extra latency and eventually upgrade the overall encoding performance. Another benefit with this configuration is that for any thread, no extra waiting cycle is required to acquire the Mutual exclusion (Mutex) lock. Whenever there is no macroblock available for encoding, each thread will enter the shared region. In the shared region, only one thread is allowed to access at one time. Before entering the shared region, each thread will try to acquire a Mutex lock to gain an access and execute the code inside the shared region. In this way, no thread will fall into a waiting state, since there will be no repeated failures in acquiring the Mutex lock. This will not incur extra latency and eventually upgrade the overall encoding performance. Therefore, this solves the thread synchronization problem without the data race condition and <b>thread</b> <b>locking</b> overhead.|$|E

As described in Section 1 R 19 of this report, the NRC concluded that the failure to establish adequate procedural controls for the maintenance of electrical connections on diesel generators led to the failure of Diesel Generator 2 during testing on January 15, 2008.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the design and}} fabrication of DebriSat, a 50 kg satellite developed to be representative of a modern low Earth orbit satellite {{in terms of its}} components, materials used, and fabrication procedures. DebriSat will be the target of a future hypervelocity impact experiment to determine the physical characteristics of debris generated after an on-orbit collision of a modern LEO satellite. The major ground-based satellite impact experiment used by DoD and NASA in their development of satellite breakup models was SOCIT, conducted in 1992. The target used for that experiment was a Navy transit satellite (~ 40 cm, 35 kg) fabricated in the 1960 's. Modern satellites are very different in materials and construction techniques than those built 40 years ago. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} conduct a similar experiment using a modern target satellite to improve the fidelity of the satellite breakup models. To ensure that DebriSat is truly representative of typical LEO missions, a comprehensive study of historical LEO satellite designs and missions within the past 15 years for satellites ranging from 1 kg to 5000 kg was conducted. This study identified modern trends in hardware, material, and construction practices utilized in recent LEO missions. Although DebriSat is an engineering model, specific attention is placed on the quality, type, and quantity of the materials used in its fabrication to ensure the integrity of the outcome. With the exception of software, all other aspects of the satellite s design, fabrication, and assembly integration and testing will be as rigorous as that of an actual flight vehicle. For example, to simulate survivability of launch loads, DebriSat will be subjected to a vibration test. As well, the satellite will undergo thermal vacuum tests to verify that the components and overall systems meet typical environmental standards. Proper assembly and integration techniques will involve comprehensive joint analysis, including the precise torqueing of fasteners and <b>thread</b> <b>locking.</b> Finally, the implementation of process documentation and verification procedures is discussed to provide a comprehensive overview of the design and fabrication of this representative LEO satellite...|$|E
