40|$|Abstract High {{hydrocarbon}} resource potential {{makes the}} Russian Arctic an attractive region for major {{oil and gas}} producing companies. Any investment decision is commonly based on an assessment stage which includes various types of technical and economical evaluations. Transportation cost in the Russian Arctic drastically influences overall project economics. Thus accurate method for transportation cost assessment becomes important from early stages of project definition. Infrastructure in the Russian Arctic is poorly developed so conventional estimation methods of hydrocarbon <b>transportation</b> <b>tariff</b> are ineffective. This paper describes a cost estimation method for tanker transportation of oil which considers key features of operations in the Russian Arctic...|$|E
40|$|In {{the recent}} years, new {{electronic}} procurement technologies {{have been successfully}} implemented in freight transportation marketplaces. This new type of trading between freight transportation agents requires new analytical tools {{to better understand the}} consequences of different strategies and forms of transportation capacity allocation. I studied two cases. First, a transportation market where an O-D pair is operated round-trip by multiple carriers, providing service to multiple shippers. Second, a multiple O-D pairs' market, operated by multiple carriers, providing service to multiple shippers. In both cases the shippers' demand function is elastic to the transportation service prices. The shippers contract each shipment to a single carrier following an open auction, in which the shipper selects the carrier based on the best bidding price. Carriers contracted to serve the shipments will often make empty movements to reposition their equipment. Hence, they will attempt to "generate" demand for these empty trips, in order to obtain revenue for their spare capacity. Carriers may generate demand for this capacity by offering service substantially below the market price (as low as the marginal cost of shipping). Shippers on the other hand, decide when to buy transportation services (and how much), i. e., the frequency of shipment and lot size, based on a strategy to minimize the total inventory and transportation costs. A significant reduction in the <b>transportation</b> <b>tariff</b> triggers an adjustment in the replenishment pattern of shippers, {{as a response to the}} beneficial market conditions. The new generated demand transforms shippers into bidders for the available spare capacity at discounted prices. This double-auction scheme allocates shipments to the otherwise unused capacity thus reducing the network's empty movements, which also reduces the average transportation cost in the network. In this paper, I show that under an EOQ policy an average discount spot price of two thirds of the market price will trigger a demand generation for transportation services in the shippers' pool. The paper presents a numerical application of the derived model, in which the double-auction scheme reduces the network average <b>transportation</b> <b>tariff</b> by at least 14 %. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work {{was to assess the}} effect of {{applying}} new technology to the economics of a proposed natural gas-to-liquids (GTL) plant, to evaluate the potential of a slower-paced, staged deployment of GTL technology, and to evaluate the effect of GTL placement of economics. Five scenarios were economically evaluated and compared: a no-major-gas-sales scenario, a gas-pipeline/LNG scenario, a fast-paced GTL development scenario, a slow-paced GTL development scenario, and a scenario which places the GTL plant in lower Alaska, instead of on the North Slope. Evaluations were completed using an after-tax discounted cash flow analysis. Results indicate that the slow-paced GTL scenario is the only one with a rate of return greater than 10 %. The slow-paced GTL development would allow cost saving on subsequent expansions. These assumed savings, along with the lowering of the <b>transportation</b> <b>tariff,</b> combine to distinguish this option for marketing the North Slope gas from the other scenarios. Critical variables that need further consideration include the GTL plant cost, the GTL product premium, and operating and maintenance costs...|$|E

The economic level of these islands is still low and, therefor, can not afford the commercial <b>transportation</b> <b>tariff.</b> Since 1974 the government of Indonesia has provided so called pioneer shipping (subsidized financially by government) in order to improve accessibility of these islands. So far, the economic level of population of these islands has not much improved. The pioneer ships are general cargo type (coaster), with long distance trips (average 1. 660 sea mile) and take about 18 days for a round trip. The determination of shipping routes for servicing less developed islands are made without any deep analysis. This paper began with analysis of selecting ports in order to improve routes of the pioneer ships. To determiny an optimum sea transportation services into the area, the shipping should be classified in regional pioneer routes (main regional feeder), secondary regional feeder, and people shipping. This study found out that the total 22 ports in the area can be divided to 3 categories (hierarchy), 2 regional ports, 7 regional main ports, and 8 secondary regional feeder ports, and 5 people shipping ports...|$|E

40|$|Master's thesis in FinanceThis master {{thesis is}} a study of how new {{investment}} models for gas infrastructure can contribute to realization of new gas resources on the NCS. It analyzes the separation of gas infrastructure {{from the rest of}} the field development and compares the result with the present investment model. The analysis also explores new potential investors that could invest in large gas infrastructure projects. The findings indicate that the IRR of the new model gives a higher rate of return on the field development by separating gas infrastructure {{from the rest of the}} field development. The results show a difference of 4, 48 % between the present and the new investment model, which indicate that a separation of gas infrastructure can lead to realization of more gas resources on the NC. The IRR is mentioned her since it is an important financial decision making tool in this thesis. The study explores the gas infrastructure history on the NCS and explains the corporate structure and the regulations of different companies, organisations and governmental bodies. The regulation of the gas <b>transportation</b> <b>tariff</b> is important for the analysis to be able to calculate the cash flow for the gas infrastructure investment. The IRR indicates that there are two potential investors of the gas infrastructure for the new investment model, which are Investment funds and the Norwegian government. Since the tariff is regulated to yield a reasonable rate of return of 7 %, other potential investors indicate that the rate of return is too low to be profitable. E&P companies have to find large gas reservoirs to compensate for the regulated rate of return to meet their rate of return demands for investing. The analysis is based on modern financial decision making theories. Studies show that choosing the new investment model could relieve E&P companies form binding large amounts of capital in gas infrastructure; this gives them the opportunity to dedicate their capital to their core competence areas, exploration and production...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{demonstrate}} {{feasibility of}} the proposed integrated optimization of various MTS parameters to reduce capital investments as well as decrease any operational and maintenance expense. This will make use of MTS reasonable. At present, the Maglev Transport Systems (MTS) for High-Speed Ground Transportation (HSGT) almost do not apply. Significant capital investments, high operational and maintenance costs are the main reasons why Maglev Transport Systems (MTS) are hardly currently used for the High-Speed Ground Transportation (HSGT). Therefore, this article justifies use of Theory of Complex Optimization of Transport (TCOT), developed {{by one of the}} co-authors, to reduce MTS costs. Methodology. According to TCOT, authors developed an abstract model of the generalized transport system (AMSTG). This model mathematically determines the optimal balance between all components of the system and thus provides the ultimate adaptation of any transport systems to the conditions of its application. To identify areas for effective use of MTS, by TCOT, the authors developed a dynamic model of distribution and expansion of spheres of effective use of transport systems (DMRRSEPTS). Based on this model, the most efficient transport system was selected for each individual track. The main estimated criterion at determination of efficiency of application of MTS is the size of the specific <b>transportation</b> <b>tariff</b> received from calculation of payback of total given expenses to a standard payback period or term of granting the credit. Findings. The completed multiple calculations of four types of MTS: TRANSRAPID, MLX 01, TRANSMAG and TRANSPROGRESS demonstrated efficiency of the integrated optimization of the parameters of such systems. This research made possible expending the scope of effective usage of MTS in about 2 times. The achieved results were presented at many international conferences in Germany, Switzerland, United States, China, Ukraine, etc. Using MTS as an example, this research proved the sustainability {{of the proposed}} integrated optimization parameters of transport systems. This approach could be applied not only for MTS, but also for other transport systems. Originality. The bases of the complex optimization of transport presented are the new system of universal scientific methods and approaches that ensure high accuracy and authenticity of calculations with the simulation of transport systems and transport networks taking into account the dynamics of their development. Practical value. The development of the theoretical and technological bases of conducting the complex optimization of transport makes it possible to create the scientific tool, which ensures the fulfillment of the automated simulation and calculating of technical and economic structure and technology of the work of different objects of transport, including its infrastructure...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} national optimal <b>tariffs</b> for <b>transportation</b> of natural gas in a setting where national gas production in its entirety is exported to end-user markets abroad. In {{a situation where the}} transportation network is owned altogether by a vertically integrated national gas producer, it is shown that the optimal tariff depends on the ownership structure in the integrated transportation company {{as well as in the}} non-facility based gas company. There are two reasons why it is possibly optimal with a mark-up on marginal transportation costs. First, there is a premium on public revenue if domestic taxation is distorting. Second, with incomplete national taxation of rents from the gas sector, the <b>transportation</b> <b>tariffs</b> can serve as a second best way of appropriating rents accruing to foreigners. In a situation where the network is run as a separate entity subject to a rate of return regulation, it will be optimal to discriminate the tariffs between shippers for the usual Ramseyean reasons...|$|R

40|$|With US {{shale gas}} {{dominating}} the headlines {{of the energy}} media {{for the past several}} years, Canadian gas has been somewhat overshadowed. While gas industry followers outside North America may have been aware of the reduction in Canadian gas exports to the US, they will likely have missed the complex interaction of lower cost US shale invading regional Canadian markets formerly domestically supplied. This situation has been further exacerbated as Canadian <b>transportation</b> <b>tariffs</b> have been raised to compensate for lower throughput. Ieda Gomes provides a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics of these and other key elements of Canadaâs gas fundamentals and how they have, and will continue, to evolve. The loss of Provincial and Federal tax and royalty take due to lowered exports, production growth and prices is also important and leads to an assessment of potential new market segments such as natural gas and LNG vehicles and Tar Sands sectors (currently impacted by low oil prices). This inevitably leads to the exploration of the obvious replacement for the lost pipeline export volumes, namely LNG exports. Readers will already be aware of the numerous proposed LNG export projects on Canadaâs West and East Coasts. The paper provides a succinct description of each of these and details at the individual project level, and in overview, the significant challenges to be overcome; both physical, in terms of transportation distances and greenfield construction (in a region of insufficient skilled resources), and political, in terms of the myriad overlapping approval and consent processes that have to be satisfied prior to construction starting. A lack of clarity on the LNG-specific fiscal framework adds yet another layer of uncertainty. The final hurdle is of course the relative competitiveness of Canadian LNG projects to US Gulf Coast brownfield projects and Australian expansion projects at a time when; global demand for LNG over the next decade appears to have declined, the window for new supply requirement appears to have moved back to the early 2020 s, and Asian buyers appear set on moving away from oil-indexed long term contract prices...|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to fight {{relatively}} high inflation, many developing countries try to manage their nominal exchange rates through official intervention.

The latter test supports the PPP theory in twice as many developing countries as the former test, suggesting that nonlinear adjustment towards PPP in developing countries is an important phenomenon.

Chinese government agencies have introduced a number of policies in support of rapidly growing cross-border e-commerce to promote China’s international trade.

Consequently the Japanese producer will be forced to drop his/her price. (If the Japanese price is less than the US, then the reverse would occur.) Now consider if there are many blocks of steel in each country.

This process is called arbitrage. Eventually prices (after adjustment by the exchange rate) would equalize. This suggests the following equality...|$|R
40|$|This study {{develops}} a practical {{supply and demand}} model of bilateral trade flows. The model is constructed in two tiers. First, aggregate import demand and aggregate export supply are determined from aggregate economic relations that contain real income (output) and relative prices.

By differentiating import prices from export prices, the analysis incorporates international <b>transportation</b> costs and <b>tariffs.</b> The result is a simultaneous system that determines bilateral trade flows and bilateral prices given country incomes, domestic price levels and international transmission factors. The model in dynamic form is estimated from a panel of bilateral trade flows for five major OECD countries (United States, Japan, France, West Germany, United Kingdom) for the years 1958 - 1971. The model has many applications, e. g. in the analyses of the impacts on trade flows of differential economic growth rates and tariff policies.

Two-part tariffs do {{not solve the problem}} as they would if there were a single retailer, because the wholesale unit price must be higher than marginal cost to prevent arbitrage to the cities.

50|$|Economic {{liberalization}} of 1991 followed by Information Technology industry explosion have taken India {{to a new}} growth scenario. Backed by strong fundamentals and commendable growth {{in the past three}} to four years, the resplendent Indian Economy is poised to grow even further at an average of 8 to 10% in the next 3 years. Transport requirement in the country, being primarily a derived demand, is slated to increase with elasticity of 1.25 with GDP growth by 10 to 12% in the medium and long term range. Riding on the waves of economic success, Indian Railways has witnessed a dramatic turn around and unprecedented financial turnover in the last two and a half years. This has been made possible by higher freight volumes without substantial investment in infrastructure, increased axle load, reduction of turn-round time of rolling stock, reduced unit cost of <b>transportation,</b> rationalization of <b>tariffs</b> resulting in improvement in market share and improved operational margins. Over the last 2 to 3 years, the railway freight traffic has grown by 8 to 11%, which is projected to cross 1100 million tonnes by the end of 11th Five Year Plan.|$|R
40|$|Developing {{countries}} pay {{substantially higher}} transportation costs than developed nations, {{which leads to}} less trade and perhaps lower incomes. This paper investigates price discrimination in the shipping industry and the role it plays in determining transportation costs. In the presence of market power, shipping prices depend on the demand characteristics of goods being traded. We show theoretically and estimate empirically that ocean cargo carriers charge higher prices when transporting goods with higher product prices, lower import demand elasticities, and higher tariffs, and when facing fewer competitors on a trade route. These characteristics explain more variation in shipping prices than do conventional proxies such as distance, and significantly contribute to the higher shipping prices facing the developing world. A simple back of the envelope calculation suggests that eliminating market power in shipping would boost trade volumes by 5. 9 % (for the US) to 15. 2 % (for Latin America). Our findings are also important for evaluating the impact of tariff liberalization. Cargo carriers decrease shipping prices by 1 - 2 % for every 1 % reduction in <b>tariffs.</b> <b>Transportation</b> costs Price discrimination Liner conferences...|$|R
