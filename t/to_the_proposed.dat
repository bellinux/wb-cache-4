5|$|Concerns {{have been}} {{expressed}} {{that the use}} of explicit-constant definitions of the unit being defined that are not related to an example of its quantity will have many adverse effects. Although this criticism applies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> linking of the kilogram to the Planck constant via a route that requires a knowledge of both special relativity and quantum mechanics, it does not apply <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> definition of the ampere, which is closer to an example of its quantity than is the current definition. Some observers have welcomed the proposal to base the definition of electric current on the charge of the electron rather than the current definition of a force between two parallel current-carrying wires – since the nature of the electromagnetic interaction between two bodies at the quantum electrodynamics level is somewhat different from the nature at classical electrodynamic levels, it is considered inappropriate to use classical electrodynamics to define quantities that exist at quantum electrodynamic levels.|$|E
5|$|For the sejm of 1606 {{the royal}} faction, hoping to take {{advantage}} of the glorious Battle of Kircholm victory and other successes, submitted a more comprehensive constructive reform program.

5|$|In linguistics, R. M. W.

5|$|A second {{attempt to}} gain the {{agreement}} of Militia colonels <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> amalgamation was made in late June, and was strongly opposed. All fourteen of the Militia representatives insisted that overseas service should be done by complete Militia battalions, rather than drafts sent to regular battalions. A third meeting, in October, proposed that the Militia join with the Volunteers as the senior element of the Territorial Force; this, too, was rejected. As both possible approaches {{for dealing with the}} Militia had been strongly opposed, the decision was taken to do away with it entirely {{and replace it with a}} newly created force, the Special Reserve, which would incorporate those elements of the Militia willing to be transferred.|$|E

5|$|According to the Polish {{historian}} Tadeusz Mańczuk, Piłsudski – who {{was planning}} a coup d'état in Kaunas – discouraged the local PMO activists from {{carrying out the}} Sejny Uprising. Piłsudski reasoned that any hostilities could leave Lithuanians even more opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> union with Poland (see Międzymorze). The local PMO disregarded his recommendations and launched the uprising. While locally successful, {{it led to the}} failure of the nationwide coup.|$|E
5|$|Amundsen did not {{publicise}} {{his change}} of plan. As Scott's biographer David Crane points out, the expedition's {{public and private}} funding was earmarked for scientific work in the Arctic; there was {{no guarantee that the}} backers would understand or agree <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> volte-face. Furthermore, the altered objective might cause Nansen to revoke the use of Fram, or parliament to halt the expedition for fear of undermining Scott and offending the British. Amundsen concealed his intentions from everyone except his brother Leon and his second-in-command, Nilsen. This secrecy led to awkwardness; Scott had sent Amundsen instruments to enable their two expeditions, at opposite ends of the earth, to make comparative readings. When Scott, in Norway to test his motor sledges, telephoned Amundsen's home to discuss cooperation, the Norwegian would not take the call.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{favorable}} position {{toward the}} proposed federal constitution, Marshall {{was chosen as}} a delegate to the convention from Fayette County. On June 25, 1788, he joined Jefferson County delegates Robert Breckinridge and Rice Bullock in voting for ratification. Ten other Kentucky delegates opposed ratification and one abstained. The final convention vote was 8979 in favor of ratification. It was reported that even the Jefferson County delegates were beginning to waver in their commitment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> constitution, but that Marshall steeled their resolve and also influenced several delegates {{from other parts of}} Virginia to favor it.|$|E

5|$|During the 1960s, {{aeronautical}} designers {{looked to}} variable-geometry wing designs {{to gain the}} manoeuvrability and efficient cruise of straight wings {{with the speed of}} swept wing designs. The United Kingdom had cancelled the procurement of the TSR-2 and subsequent F-111K aircraft, and was still looking for a replacement for its Avro Vulcan and Blackburn Buccaneer strike aircraft. Britain and France had initiated the AFVG (Anglo French Variable Geometry) project in 1965, but this had ended with French withdrawal in 1967. Britain continued to develop a variable-geometry aircraft similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> AFVG, and sought new partners to achieve this.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{cessation}} of hostilities, the Australian government decided {{that it would not}} contribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> Allied occupation force in Germany and would begin the process of demobilisation of the AIF as soon as possible. Owing to the large number of soldiers deployed overseas, this process took some time, and it was decided to progressively return men from each battalion, rather than send them home as a formed unit. As numbers dwindled, units were amalgamated for administrative purposes, and as a consequence the 9th and 10th Battalions were merged on 5 February 1919; the final contingent of troops from the 10th Battalion did not return home until September 1919 when they disembarked in Adelaide from the transport Takada.|$|E
5|$|Freedom fries was a {{political}} euphemism for French fries in the United States. The term came to prominence in 2003 when the then Republican Chairman of the Committee on House Administration, Bob Ney, renamed the menu item in three Congressional cafeterias in response to France's opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> invasion of Iraq. Although originally supported with several restaurants changing their menus as well, the term fell out of use due to declining support for the Iraq War. Following Ney's resignation as Chairman in 2006, it was quietly reverted.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, the United States, Russia, the European Union (EU) and the UN {{sought to}} replace the Vance plan, which brought in the UNPROFOR. They {{formulated}} the Z-4 Plan giving Serb-majority areas in Croatia substantial autonomy. After numerous and frequently uncoordinated changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> plan, including leaking of its draft elements to the press in October, the Z-4 Plan was presented on 30 January 1995. Neither Croatia nor the RSK liked the plan. Croatia was concerned that the RSK might accept it, but Tuđman realised that Milošević, who would ultimately make the decision for the RSK, would not accept the plan for fear that it would set a precedent for a political settlement in Kosovoallowing Croatia to accept the plan with little possibility {{for it to be}} implemented. The RSK refused to receive, let alone accept, the plan.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 José Manuel Barroso became President: the Parliament {{once again}} {{asserted}} itself in objecting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> {{membership of the}} Barroso Commission.

The Barroso Commission {{was also the first}} full Commission since the enlargement in 2004 to 25 members and hence the number of Commissioners {{at the end of the}} Prodi Commission had reached 30. As a result of the increase in the number of states, the Amsterdam Treaty triggered a reduction in the number of Commissioners to one per state, rather than two for the larger states.|$|E

5|$|In {{a letter}} dated 12 June 1842 in the Colonial Secretary's Records, Marshall Clifton, Chief Commissioner of the Western Australian Land Company, {{wrote of the}} need for an {{improved}} Perth–Fremantle–Bunbury road. On a special trip he took in the previous October to look for a new route, two surveyors gave their approval <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> coastal route, with a ferry across the estuary. Governor John Hutt approved of the idea of a road, but thought a ferry would be impractical, at least during winter, and that the lack of public funds made it impossible. Clifton continued to write letters to the Colonial Secretary advocating the construction of a road.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, Lawrence Johnson, {{a member}} of Waco's city council, viewed {{pictures}} of the Washington lynching at the National Civil Rights Museum, and began to lobby for {{a monument to the}} lynching. In 2002, Lester Gibson, another member of the city council, proposed that a plaque be installed at the courthouse where Washington was lynched. He further stated that the plaque should carry an apology from the city. The ideas were discussed, but proved unfruitful. In the 2000s, the idea of a memorial was revived by a McLennan County commissioner and the Waco Chamber of Commerce; the Waco Herald Tribune has editorialized in support of a historical marker {{on the site of the}} lynching. Some descendants of Fryer objected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> memorial.|$|E
