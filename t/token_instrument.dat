25|$|The Engineer's siding at Eardington is {{controlled}} by a ground frame. No intermediate <b>token</b> <b>instrument</b> is provided, with the Highley-Bridgnorth token directly unlocking the two lever frame. This means that Hampton Loade signal box must be switched out when Eardington siding has to be used, and also that a train cannot terminate or depart from there - unless the token is taken by road between Eardington and Highley or Bridgnorth signal box.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{disadvantages}} {{of the staff}} and ticket system {{is that it is}} very inflexible. If a locomotive fails in a station, for example, a token staff may be at the wrong end of a section and will have to be moved by road. This situation does not occur under the Electric Token System (ETS), a more advanced system in which tokens can be obtained at either end of a section from a <b>token</b> <b>instrument.</b>|$|E
25|$|All {{sections}} between Bridgnorth and Bewdley North operate {{using the}} Tyer's Electric Train Token. Both Arley and Hampton Loade signal boxes can be switched out when not {{required by the}} service, reducing wear on the mechanics and {{reducing the number of}} signalmen required to operate the line. Arley yard may be accessed with the signal box switched out due to the presence of an intermediate <b>token</b> <b>instrument,</b> which also enables a train to depart from or terminate in the yard when the 'box is switched out.|$|E
50|$|Prior to its closure {{rationalisation}} {{took place}} in the form of closure of the signal box, removal of the upper portion and relocation of the <b>token</b> <b>instruments</b> into to the Station Master's office in the main station building.|$|R
50|$|<b>Token</b> <b>instruments</b> can be {{arranged}} for unattended operation, when they are operated by the train crew at intermediate crossing loops or at the terminus of the line. This system is widely found in Australia, where traffic density on many lines is low.|$|R
5000|$|A {{corresponding}} arrangement sometimes applied where {{permanent way}} maintenance {{was carried out}} by motorised trolley. Usually this used special [...] "occupation key" [...] instruments which were interlocked with the normal <b>token</b> <b>instruments</b> and provided at intermediate places where the trolley might be off-tracked (or stored overnight).|$|R

50|$|At {{its peak}} {{the line was}} {{carrying}} 120 train movements a day. Auxiliary <b>token</b> <b>instruments</b> were provided at the extremity of the loops, and a considerable technical workload resulted in restoring the unbalanced token extractions. The remote loop points were electrically operated by hand generator at the signalboxes.|$|R
50|$|In certain {{circumstances}} it was convenient {{to shorten the}} single line sections by providing an intermediate signal box equipped with <b>token</b> <b>instruments</b> without providing a passing loop there. This was done if there was, for example, an important siding connection at the intermediate location. It also enabled following through trains to run at closer headways, but did not facilitate opposing movements.|$|R

50|$|If it was {{necessary}} for the train to be on the sidings controlled by the ground frame for a considerable time, it was desirable to release the running line so other trains could travel through the block section. To achieve this, a <b>token</b> <b>instrument</b> would be provided in a lineside hut near the ground frame. Once the train was off the main line, the points would be set back to normal, allowing the token to be removed from the ground frame. It would be then inserted into the <b>token</b> <b>instrument</b> in the hut, releasing the instruments {{at both ends of the}} section, so either signal box could then remove a token for another train to use the line, whilst the shunting train was in the sidings.|$|E
50|$|The {{electric}} key <b>token</b> <b>instrument</b> for {{the block}} section to Yeovil are now {{operated by the}} train crew {{under the supervision of}} the signal operator based at Yeovil Pen Mill. The block section to Dorchester West is operated under the 'tokenless single line' principle with track circuiting.|$|E
50|$|In 1989 the box {{was taken}} out of use, with the signal heads being removed and the <b>token</b> <b>instrument</b> from Tan-y-Bwlch, and the {{although}} trap points (from Minffordd) were installed at the Tan-y-Bwlch end of the loop, they were never commissioned. During this period, the ground frame was only usable as a refuge siding, and {{it was not possible to}} cross passenger trains.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a passing}} loop and level {{crossing}} (of the A40 road) at the station, but the signal box that formerly operated them was closed in 1986. The <b>token</b> <b>instruments</b> {{for the single}} line and crossing barriers are both operated by the train crew {{under the supervision of}} the signaller at Pantyffynnon. The loop had been temporarily decommissioned between 2008 & 2010, but is in use again after the automatic point machines were renewed in June 2010.|$|R
50|$|In 2012 {{the only}} passing loop on the Whitland to Pembroke Dock branch {{is located at}} Tenby and as such east and {{westbound}} trains are often scheduled to pass here. As {{there is no longer}} a signal box at the station, the electric <b>token</b> <b>instruments</b> for the block sections either side are operated by the train crew under the supervision of the Whitland signaller (a similar system operates on the Heart of Wales Line). Tenby has the first application of motor points worked directly by the token system.|$|R
5000|$|Until {{the late}} 20th century, the token system was {{standard}} on British single-track lines {{and it still}} remains {{on a number of}} lines there as well as elsewhere, such as the line between [...] and Stranraer in south west Scotland. Traditional token systems are also in use on heritage railways in Britain, for example on the Mid Hants Railway and the West Somerset Railway which is fitted throughout with Tyer's electric <b>token</b> <b>instruments.</b> The Bluebell Railway has short section token working between adjacent boxes and long section working available between Sheffield Park and Kingscote.|$|R
50|$|The Tyer's No. 6 tablet {{instrument}} {{was far more}} widespread in the UK and was adopted by most railway companies on single line installations. However, when the Tyer's No. 9 key <b>token</b> <b>instrument</b> was patented 40 years later in 1912, it began to replace the No. 6 due to it being compact, easier to use and had far fewer moving parts to service and repair.|$|E
50|$|The Engineer's siding at Eardington is {{controlled}} by a ground frame. No intermediate <b>token</b> <b>instrument</b> is provided, with the Highley-Bridgnorth token directly unlocking the two lever frame.

50|$|The {{genesis of}} the system was on the Far North Line, a long, remote {{single-track}} line between Inverness, Wick and Thurso in Scotland. This line was controlled by traditional electric <b>token</b> <b>instruments</b> at each station, but in January 1978 the signal telegraph pole route was brought down by bad weather over more than forty miles of track. The simplest, cheapest and quickest way of restoring the links between the instruments {{was found to be}} by radio: each machine was fitted with an external controller containing a unique microprocessor code so that the effect of a dedicated link to the machine {{at the other end of}} its section was maintained. The manual issue of the tokens continued as before.|$|R
50|$|With the {{feasibility}} of using radio to effect the interlocking of single line <b>token</b> <b>instruments</b> demonstrated, and the additional benefit of voice communication between the signaller and the drivers noted, it was but a short step of invention to moving the instruments from staffed signal boxes to the cabs of trains. The line selected for the trial was another remote and lightly used Scottish line: the old Highland Railway route from Dingwall westwards to Kyle of Lochalsh. The contract was placed with Westinghouse of Chippenham, Wiltshire, and the system was brought into use on 28 October 1984, with the control equipment situated at Dingwall. Over the next four years, control was transferred to Inverness and the Wick and Thurso line {{was included in the}} scheme.|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, in the Abermule train {{collision}} in 1921, lax {{working procedures}} allowed the safeguards {{provided by the}} electric token system to be circumvented; a driver was handed a token for the wrong section, and proceeded on the mistaken belief that the token was correct. To prevent this, it became a requirement in the UK for the signals controlling entry to the single line section (starting or section signals) to be locked at danger unless a token has been released from the relevant <b>token</b> <b>instrument.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sometimes an {{intermediate}} siding is provided on the single line section, and the token itself, or a key {{fixed to the}} end of it, unlocks the points for shunting there. The token is locked in the apparatus there, and the driver cannot retrieve the token until the points have been set to the through running position and locked again. In special situations where the sidings at the intermediate location are extensive, the equipment is arranged for the shunting train to be put wholly inside the sidings, clear of the main line; in this situation {{an intermediate}} <b>token</b> <b>instrument</b> can be provided, enabling the driver to surrender the token so that normal through working can take place on the single line while his train is at the sidings.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} {{controlled}} by power-operated signalling from a cabin. When the double metre-gauge line from the station up to Tambaram was electrified in 1931 with the 1,500v DC overhead system, automatic signalling was provided between the station and Madras Egmore. However, it does not signal the broad-gauge line of the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway from Rayapuram, which also serves the station. The single line to Rayapuram {{was controlled by}} the Theobald's <b>Token</b> <b>instrument,</b> invented by an engineer of the Madras Railway and manufactured locally in the city by a firm named Orr & Co, which was used extensively on the lines of both the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway and the South Indian Railway. It was housed in the station office. The signalling of the station is controlled from Siemens all-electric power frame of 1935.|$|E
50|$|Automatic {{signalling}} {{was installed}} at Tan-y-Bwlch in 1986. By the 1988 season, {{in part due}} to the challenges in maintenance of the top end points at Dduallt and the planned automation of Minffordd, the loops at Dduallt and Rhiw Goch had been taken out of service for crossing trains. At the end of May 1988, Dduallt ceased to be a token station and Dduallt loop was taken out of service altogether and became a siding. Rhiw Goch ceased to be used except on odd occasions and was taken out of use as a means to cross passenger trains in 1989. The short section <b>token</b> <b>instruments</b> and the signal heads were removed, although the loop could still be used as a refuge for Engineers' trains. Minffordd and Tan-y-Bwlch therefore became the usual passing loops, both automated.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station was}} notable {{for being the}} last working example of Highland Railway {{signalling}} principles, where a signal box was provided at each end to work the signals & points whilst the key <b>token</b> <b>instruments</b> for working the single line were located in the main building. The distance between the boxes was such that a bicycle was officially provided by BR (and later Railtrack) for the signaller to use. [...] The practice {{came to an end}} in April 2000, when the station was resignalled with colour lights and control shifted to a panel in the station building - as a result, most passenger services use the northern (former eastbound) platform in both directions (the southern one is now only used by Aberdeen-bound services if two trains are scheduled to pass here).|$|R
5000|$|The line {{is single}} track {{throughout}} (except {{for a few}} miles {{at the southern end}} shared with the Swansea District line) and has been operated under a Light Railway Order since 1972. There are five passing loops, at , , , [...] and [...] Unless [...] "Out of Course" [...] working occurs the Llanwrtyd passing loop is used on two of the Monday - Saturday services and the Llandrindod passing loop is in use on the other two and also on the Sunday services. The signalling was modernised in 1986, when a system known as No Signalman Token Remote working was introduced. This is overseen by the signaller at , with the <b>token</b> <b>instruments</b> at the aforementioned five passing loops being operated by the train crew (the surviving signal boxes at each station having been closed as part of the modernisation scheme and the points converted to automatic operation) by British Rail.|$|R
5000|$|In the UK it {{is known}} as the [...] "No-signalman key token system". Examples on the UK {{national}} network are the North Devon Line, where the system was brought into use on December 1, 1987, the Heart of Wales Line (commissioned in 1986), the Matlock branch in Derbyshire and the Liskeard to Looe line in Cornwall. Here the train guard not only operates the Tyer's No.9 electric <b>token</b> <b>instrument</b> controlling the upper section of the branch, but operates the points as well. The lower section is operated on the [...] "One Engine in Steam" [...] principle with a simple wooden staff. Possession of the staff is required to unlock the ground frame controlling the points at Coombe Junction, where the two sections meet. There is no other signalling on the branch except to control entry and exit to and from the main line.|$|E
50|$|The North Yorkshire Moors Railway {{has been}} running steam trains between Whitby and Glaisdale {{in the past few}} years, using hired {{locomotives}} and stock insured for use on Network Rail track. It is planning a share scheme to raise capital for operating services direct from Whitby Station (again on the existing Network Rail infrastructure). This would involve work on signalling facilities, reinstating a second platform (work completed in August 2014), improvements to rolling stock and ticket facilities at Whitby. To allow through running of trains directly from the North Yorkshire Moors line, an intermediate <b>token</b> <b>instrument</b> was provided at Grosmont in March 2007. This allows a token for the Glaisdale-Whitby section to be obtained or returned at Grosmont. Previously, for steam services to Whitby to operate from the North Yorkshire Moors Railway a signalman had to drive to Glaisdale to pick up or return a token key.|$|E
50|$|The entire railway {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{comprehensively}} signalled heritage railways. With the exception of the connection at Kidderminster to Network Rail metals (which uses a colour light signal) the whole railway is signalled using GW style lower quadrant signals, of both metal and wooden pole/arm types (Exceptionally, the down starter at Highley has a rare concrete post). Each station (not including halts) has a signal box, with Bewdley having two boxes (North and South), due to the size of the layout there (Bewdley originally being a junction station).All sections between Bridgnorth and Bewdley North operate using the Tyer's Electric Train Token. Both Arley and Hampton Loade signal boxes can be switched out when not required by the service, reducing wear on the mechanics and reducing the number of signalmen required to operate the line. Arley yard may be accessed with the signal box switched out due to the presence of an intermediate <b>token</b> <b>instrument,</b> which also enables a train to depart from or terminate in the yard when the 'box is switched out.|$|E
50|$|On 9 August 1910 {{there was}} a fatal {{accident}} when a train being stabled in the Linecraigs engine sidings collided with an engine already in the sidings. A cleaner, G. Jamieson, engaged in cleaning the standing engine, was knocked down by his engine, run over, and killed.The cause of the accident was the irregular use of a key to unlock the electric <b>token</b> <b>instruments.</b> This practice was authorised by A. Black, the superintendent of the line. He stated at the Board of Trade Inquiry into the accident {{that the reason for}} this practice was a desire to save the expense connected with the wear of the batteries that supplied power to the tablet instruments. This was achieved by suspending tablet working until 9 o'clock in the morning, as, prior to that hour, there was only one engine in steam in use on the line, and the suspension of tablet working enabled the batteries to be overhauled and cleaned.|$|R

5000|$|The {{staff and}} ticket system {{was still too}} {{inflexible}} for busy lines, as it did not allow for the situation where the train intended to carry the actual token was cancelled or running very late. To provide for this, the electric train token system was developed. Each single-line section is provided {{with a pair of}} <b>token</b> <b>instruments,</b> one at the signal box at each end. A supply of identical tokens is stored in the instruments, which are connected by telegraph lines. A token can be removed from one instrument only if both signalmen co-operate in agreeing to the release. Once a token has been removed, another cannot be removed until the token which is [...] "out" [...] is replaced in either instrument. (There are variations on this sequence of events.) By this means, it can be ensured that at any one time, only one token is available to be issued to a driver. Tokens belonging to adjacent sections have different configurations to prevent them being inserted into the wrong instrument.|$|R
