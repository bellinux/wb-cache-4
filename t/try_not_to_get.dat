After her performance, the singer was asked how she felt it went, saying she had [...] "forgotten what a crowd like that feels and looks like. I <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> nervous – I don't like to think about things too much beforehand, otherwise I worry too much. I like to deal with the situation when it happens." [...] A beatboxer from Norfolk, Tom Povey, was picked to perform with her on stage after he was seen performing in a London pub. Povey, who performs with the stage name Intensi T, said it was the highlight of his career. Roberts also performed the song on British chat-shows Daybreak and Paul O'Grady Live.|$|E

When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Are {{women who}} are {{intentional}} about pregnancy (<b>trying</b> <b>to</b> or <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> pregnant) systematically different from {{women who are}} “okay either way” about getting pregnant? Methods. We use a currently sexually active subsample (n = 3, 771) of the National Survey of Fertility Barriers, a random digit dialing telephone survey of reproductive-aged women (ages 25 – 45) in the United States. We compare women who are <b>trying</b> <b>to,</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to,</b> or okay either way about getting pregnant on attitudes, social pressures, life course and status characteristics using bivariate analyses (chi-square tests for categorical and ANOVA tests for continuous variables). Multivariate multinomial logistic regression provides adjusted associations. Results. Most women {{say that they are}} <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> pregnant (71 %) or are okay either way (23 %); few are trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> pregnant. Among women with no prior pregnancies (n = 831), more say that they are trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> pregnant (14 %) but a similar percentage are okay either way (26 %). Several characteristics distinguish those trying to from those okay: fertility intentions, importance of motherhood, age, parity, race/ethnicity and self identifying a fertility problem. Additional characteristics are associated with <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> pregnant compared <b>to</b> being okay: ideal number of children, wanting a baby, trusting conception, relationship satisfaction, race ethnicity, economic hardship, and attitudes about career success. Conclusion. Women who are “okay either way” about pregnancy should be assessed separately from women who are intentional (<b>trying</b> <b>to,</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to)</b> about pregnancy...|$|R

500|$|McIntee praises Alien as [...] "possibly the {{definitive}} combination of horror thriller with science fiction trappings." [...] He notes, however, {{that it is}} a horror film first and a science fiction film second, since science fiction normally explores issues of how humanity will develop under other circumstances. Alien, on the other hand, focuses on the plight of people being attacked by a monster: [...] "It's set on a spaceship in the future, but it's about people <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> eaten by a drooling monstrous animal. Worse, it's about them <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> raped by said drooling monstrous animal." [...] Along with Halloween and Friday the 13th (1980), he describes it as a prototype for the slasher film genre: [...] "The reason it's such a good movie, and wowed both the critics, who normally frown on the genre, and the casual cinema-goer, is {{that it is a}} distillation of everything that scares us in the movies." [...] He also describes how the film appeals to a variety of audiences: [...] "Fans of Hitchcockian thrillers like it because it's moody and dark. Gorehounds like it for the chest-burster. Science fiction fans love the hard science fiction trappings and hardware. Men love the battle-for-survival element, and women love not being cast as the helpless victim." ...|$|R
