50|$|As for <b>female-to-male</b> <b>transgender</b> individuals, it is {{generally}} presumed that hormone therapy does successfully masculinize the voice and lower vocal pitch.

Although it is far less common, surgery to lower vocal pitch does exist, and may be considered if traditional hormone therapy did not adequately lower it. Medialization laryngoplasty (or masculinization laryngoplasty) is a procedure where the vocal fold contours are medially augmented with the injection of silastic implants. This mimics the changes that the vocal folds go through during male puberty, which causes a lower sounding voice.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{described}} HIV prevalence, risk behaviors, {{health care}} use, {{and mental health}} status of male-to-female and <b>female-to-male</b> <b>transgender</b> persons and determined factors associated with HIV. METHODS: We recruited transgender persons through targeted sampling, respondent-driven sampling, and agency referrals; 392 male-to-female and 123 <b>female-to-male</b> <b>transgender</b> persons were interviewed and tested for HIV. RESULTS: HIV prevalence among male-to-female transgender persons was 35 %. African American race (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 5. 81; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 2. 82, 11. 96), a history of injection drug use (OR = 2. 69; 95 % CI = 1. 56, 4. 62), multiple sex partners (adjusted OR = 2. 64; 95 % CI = 1. 50, 4. 62), and low education (adjusted OR = 2. 08; 95 % CI = 1. 17, 3. 68) were independently associated with HIV. Among <b>female-to-male</b> <b>transgender</b> persons, HIV prevalence (2 %) and risk behaviors were much lower. Most male-to-female (78 %) and <b>female-to-male</b> (83 %) <b>transgender</b> persons had seen a medical provider in the past 6 months. Sixty-two percent of the male-to-female and 55 % of the <b>female-to-male</b> <b>transgender</b> persons were depressed; 32 % of each population had attempted suicide. CONCLUSIONS: High HIV prevalence suggests an urgent need for risk reduction interventions for male-to-female transgender persons.

40|$|We use the {{workplace}} experiences of transgender people – individuals who change their gender typically with hormone therapy and surgery – to provide {{new insights into}} the long-standing question of what role gender plays in shaping workplace outcomes. Using an original survey of male-to-female and <b>female-to-male</b> <b>transgender</b> people, we document the earnings and employment experiences of transgender people before and after their gender transitions. We find that while transgender people have the same human capital after their transitions, their workplace experiences often change radically. We estimate that average earnings for <b>female-to-male</b> <b>transgender</b> workers increase slightly following their gender transitions, while average earnings for male-tofemale transgender workers fall by nearly 1 / 3. This finding is consistent with qualitative evidence that for many male-to-female workers, becoming a woman often brings a loss of authority, harassment, and termination, but that for many female-to-male workers, becoming a man often brings an increase in respect and authority. These findings challenge the omitted variables explanations for the gender pay gap and illustrate the often hidden and subtle processes that produce gender inequality in workplace outcomes...|$|R

A study on discrimination of lesbian, bisexual, transsexual, transgender and intersex women in Ecuador found similar results.

The “sworn virgin ” phenomenon is stud-ied in a larger, ethno-cultural context, zipping through such complicated – and sociologically contentious – notions as patriarchy, blood-feud, destructive entitlement, etc. It is argued that the “sworn virgins ” of the Balkans were forced to become “social men, ” assuming masculine social and family roles, due to specifi c economic and social conditions that have historically prevailed in northern Albania, but also in Kosovo and Montenegro. Because all aspects of human life in northern Albania have been regulated for centuries by customary law, known in its codifi ed form as the “Kanun of Lekë Dukagjini, ” the swearing to remain virgin for life may be considered as an escape mechanism for some women who were forced into unwanted marriages and into relations of extreme economic exploitation and social inequality.

Large size samples of ovarian tissue retrieved from 15 <b>female-to-male</b> <b>transgender</b> subjects (18 – 38 years) were vitrified using two solutions (containing propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, and sucrose at different concentrations) in an open system.

Currently, the recommendation is for the patient to have a hysterectomy within five years of initiating testosterone therapy to decrease {{the risk of developing}} endometrial cancer. However, long-term testosterone treatment has not been proven to cause an increased risk of endometrial cancer. With the use of gene expression and immunohistochemical studies, this study aimed to show no upregulation of genes associated with proliferation (Ki- 67) and endometrial cancer (ZIC 2) in endometrial tissue from FTM individuals treated with long-term testosterone compared to endometrial tissue from postmenopausal women, premenopausal women with benign endometrium, and women with endometrial cancer. Our findings showed that Ki- 67 and ZIC 2 expression in the FTM samples was significantly lower than in the endometrial cancer samples.
