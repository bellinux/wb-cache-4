ISSR analysis demonstrated low genetic diversity of Job's tears at the species level (h = 0. 21, I = 0. 33) and the accession level (h = 0. 07, I = 0. 10), and strong genetic differentiation (GST = 0. 6702) among all accessions.

Thin-layer chromatography of total lipids of the skin and sciatic nerves from wild-type and TNX-/- mice revealed that the amounts of major phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), in wild-type and TNX-/- mice are not different. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showed that the major fatty acid compositions of PC and PE in wild-type and TNX-/- mice are almost the same. Fibroblast cells stably overexpressing TNX also showed almost the same amounts of PC and PE and almost the same fatty acid compositions of PC and PE as those in mock-transfected cells.

40|$|Hyperbranched polymer {{produced}} from triglycerides have been polymerized via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT). Triglyceride {{is one of}} the main components in vegetable oils and has been considered stable, non-toxic and environmental friendly. Additionally, the unsaturation of fatty acid chains makes triglycerides competitive as monomer. Therefore, triglycerides are considered one of the most important bio-based chemical resources. The resulting hyperbranched polymers have great potential in coating, drug delivery, and etc [...] Chemical modification has been applied to increase chemical activities of double bonds by introducing acrylate groups. Due to the high unsaturation of modified triglycerides (~ 2. 6 functionality per molecule), radical polymerization leads to macro-gelation at low conversion according to the classic Flory-Stockmayer theory. However, this work demonstrates that gelation process is easily affected or even avoid by simply tuning reaction conditions, which affect the competition of inter-/intra molecular reactions. The intra-molecular reactions decrease the efficiency of polymerization and lead the cyclings to form within macromolecules. The increased proportion of intra-molecular reactions not only suppresses the gelation process, but also leads to heterogeneity in structure. The less homogeneous structures deviate their chain relaxation dynamics from classic models. Zimm model and Rouse model have been successfully used to describe relaxation dynamics for hyperbranched polymers. Due to the high density of side chains, main chain entanglement is largely restricted. Furthermore, the side chains also interact with the main chains, may or may not providing drag or friction, leading the relaxation process obeying Zimm model or Rouse model. In this work, a close study of hyperbranched PAESO relaxation process has been done. Discussion about how branches and cyclings deviates the process from ideal Zimm model has given.

These results were compared with the corresponding data for cow milk fat. Significant differences between herds were observed, mainly in long-chain TG.

40|$|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Long-term {{exposure}} of beta cells to lipids, particularly {{saturated fatty acids}} in vitro, results in cellular dysfunction and apoptosis (lipotoxicity); this could contribute to obesity-related diabetes. Our aims were to relate cell death to intracellular <b>triglyceride</b> concentration, <b>composition</b> and localisation following incubation of INS 1 cells in saturated and unsaturated NEFA in high and low glucose concentrations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Insulin-producing INS 1 cells were cultured (24 h; 3 and 20 mmol/l glucose) with palmitic, oleic or linoleic acids and the resulting intracellular lipids were analysed by gas chromatography and microscopy. Cell death was determined by quantitative microscopy and 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by ELISA. RESULTS: All NEFA (0. 5 mmol/l, 0. 5 % albumin) inhibited glucose-stimulated (20 mmol/l) insulin secretion. Cytotoxicity was evident only with palmitic acid (p 65 degrees C), which could induce endoplasmic reticulum stress proteins and signal apoptosis; lipid-induced apoptosis would therefore be {{a consequence of the}} physicochemical properties of these triglycerides.

Between 2 and 8 years, girls were prepubertal; AGA and SGA girls gained height, lean mass, and bone mineral content similarly; other outcomes diverged so that, at age 8, SGA girls had markedly higher levels of circulating insulin, IGF-I, DHEAS, LDL cholesterol, and leptin; lower HMW adiponectin and SHBG levels; more total and visceral fat (without being obese); and an older bone age. CONCLUSION(S) : After completing catch-up growth and before starting puberty, SGA girls develop an ensemble that includes not only central adiposity, hyperinsulinemia, and hypoadiponectinemia but also hyperleptinemia, dyslipidemia, lower SHBG and higher DHEAS levels, and faster bone maturation. status: publishe...|$|R
