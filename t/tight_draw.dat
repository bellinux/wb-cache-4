5|$|In the event, Ring {{played in}} only one Test, {{the second of the}} five-match series, played at Lord's. He took two wickets, the same number as Benaud, on a pitch {{allegedly}} susceptible to spin and scored 18 and 7 as the match ended in a <b>tight</b> <b>draw.</b>|$|E
50|$|The League Cup however, {{brought some}} cheer, with four wins and a {{draw from the}} six {{sectional}} games, Dumbarton qualified to meet Brechin City in a play off. A good home win after a <b>tight</b> <b>draw</b> at Brechin meant a quarter final against Ayr United, who were however to prove too strong.|$|E
60|$|He {{was silent}} for a moment or two. His lips were <b>tight</b> <b>drawn.</b> His eyes flashed as he turned towards her.|$|R
60|$|Pawing {{and tearing}} at earth and air, Sabor rolled and threw herself {{this way and}} that in an effort to {{dislodge}} this strange antagonist; but ever <b>tighter</b> and <b>tighter</b> <b>drew</b> the iron bands that were forcing her head lower and lower upon her tawny breast.|$|R
60|$|Winifred came {{slowly into}} the room. It seemed to Deane, {{watching}} her curiously, {{that she had been}} steeling herself to defiance. There was no change in her expression, and her lips seemed <b>tighter</b> <b>drawn</b> than ever. She went at once to her brother's side.|$|R
6000|$|He writhed and kicked, he spat and hissed. But {{the more}} he struggled, the <b>tighter</b> <b>drew</b> the cord round his neck. Everywhere, faint and trembling, rose the strange and dreadful unknown smell. He hung quite still. And as he dangled in pain, a night-wandering Bittock on a branch above him called piteously: [...] "Oo-ee, oo-ee, oo-ee!" ...|$|R
60|$|Dobson, {{seizing the}} child's {{hand in his}} own left, {{compressed}} it still <b>tighter,</b> <b>drew</b> his hunting-knife, and sliced off the reptile's head, just as Edwin Brook {{with his wife and}} daughter, attracted by the nurse's outcry, rushed from the cottage to the rescue. Scholtz and George Dally at the same time ran out respectively from stable and kitchen.|$|R
50|$|The {{style of}} artwork changes from strip, {{sometimes}} in Clowes' familiar <b>tight</b> <b>drawing</b> style, sometimes more exaggeratedly cartoony. The {{story is told}} in one-page segments that can be read individually, while creating a larger whole. It was printed with extremely thick and heavy cover boards. Wilson was the first book Clowes had published without first serializing it the way Ghost World and David Boring had first appeared in his comic book Eightball.|$|R
60|$|An hour, perhaps, she sat {{upright in}} bed, {{considering}} {{what she should}} do. Then again she reached out in the darkness and felt for her scissors. Securing them, she drew the chair cushion upon the bed and felt along its edge for the place she had sewn. She could not determine for some time which was the right edge but at last she found where the stitches seemed a little <b>tighter</b> <b>drawn</b> than elsewhere and this place she managed to rip open. To her joy she found the letter and drew {{it out with a}} sigh of relief.|$|R
60|$|And now he {{contemplated}} the noose of consequences <b>drawing</b> <b>tight</b> around him.|$|R
6000|$|... "He's in Europe. At Carlsbad, or somewhere. He {{never comes}} near the paper. He just sits <b>tight</b> and <b>draws</b> the profits. He lets the editor look after things. Just at present I'm acting as editor." ...|$|R
60|$|Half a dozen young lasses {{emerged from}} the {{adjacent}} dwellings, reminding me, by their light step and gay costume, of scenes in ancient France, where taste in dress comes natural to every class of females. The trim bodice and covered petticoat, and little apron, with its pockets to receive the hands when in an attitude for conversation; the colored kerchief wound tastefully round the head, with a coquettish knot perking above one ear; and the neat slipper and <b>tight</b> <b>drawn</b> stocking with its braid of narrow ribbon embracing the ankle where it peeps from its mysterious curtain. It is from this ambush that Cupid sends his most inciting arrows.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his book}} Art Out of Time: Unknown Comics Visionaries 1900-1969, author Dan Nadel {{described}} Briefer as ...one {{of the few}} guys in the 1940s who had that loose, gestural art style that's funny. The drawing is inherently funny. Which is really unusual for humor comics of the time ... that it's <b>tight</b> <b>drawing.</b> It's self-contained and beautiful. But Briefer {{is all over the}} place. When he does these swooping pratfalls that Frankenstein takes, the lines actually reflect the gag. It's nice. ... And they're funny as comics. They read well and are beautifully drawn; they're full of unforgettable images, like the wizard eating Frankenstein on a hot dog. You'll never forget it, for better or for worse.|$|R
60|$|So off we went, rushing past a boy by his fire, who yelled {{and threw}} a stick at us. But as it happened, on {{the borders of the}} {{property}} of the Red-faced Man there were poachers who knew that hares would come out of the wood on this day of the shooting and had made ready for us by setting wire nooses in the gaps of the hedges through which we ran. I got my foot into one of these but managed to shake it off. My sister was not so lucky, for her head went into another of them. She kicked and tore, but the more she struggled the <b>tighter</b> <b>drew</b> the noose.|$|R
60|$|In June he {{took his}} courage in both hands and {{proposed}} a visit to London. To his surprise, she acquiesced without hesitation. They went up in Whit-week. While they were passing Widrington, {{he forced himself to}} an unnatural spurt of talk; and it was not till fully quarter of an hour later that, glancing stealthily round his paper, he saw her sitting motionless, her face turned to the fields and tears rolling down it. And he dared not speak, dared not try to comfort her. She made no sound, the muscles of her face no movement; only, those tears kept rolling down. And, behind his paper, Winton's eyes narrowed and retreated; his face hardened till the skin seemed <b>tight</b> <b>drawn</b> over the bones, and every inch of him quivered.|$|R
6000|$|... "True," [...] {{answered}} Baba, with a bland smile, [...] "and if {{we would}} not have it <b>drawn</b> <b>tight,</b> we must e'en obey the commands of Omar the Dey." ...|$|R
5000|$|Dennis Harvey of Variety {{wrote that}} despite flaws, Mignone's first feature [...] "has {{delivered}} a fairly <b>tight</b> package that <b>draws</b> generally good performances from thesps in largely one-dimensional roles".|$|R
6000|$|MARMADUKE [...] Scarcely, by groping, had I {{reached the}} Spot, [...] When round my wrist I felt a cord <b>drawn</b> <b>tight,</b> [...] As if the blind Man's dog were pulling at it.|$|R
60|$|That old gentleman's neck is in {{some kind}} of a noose, thought I to myself, and his {{difficulty}} is to prevent the rope from being <b>drawn</b> <b>tight.</b> Meanwhile this poor girl's happiness and future are at stake.|$|R
60|$|The lines about Bertram D. Snooper's {{hands and}} mouth were <b>drawn</b> <b>tighter</b> as he paced to and fro, {{waiting for a}} reply to the {{question}} he intended to ask Gladys {{as soon as he}} thought of one.|$|R
60|$|Gudrun {{looked at}} his fine, thin, shiny skin, reddish-brown from the sun, <b>drawn</b> <b>tight</b> over his full temples; and at his thin hair--and at the thick, coarse, brush-like moustache, cut short about his mobile, rather shapeless mouth.|$|R
5|$|Even heavily {{armoured}} vessels {{might have}} been impeded by the chain boom, {{but it turned out}} to have an Achilles' heel: it could not be <b>drawn</b> <b>tight</b> enough without intermediate floating supports â€“ and these might be sunk by naval gunfire.|$|R
6000|$|Alas! I'm but a nameless wight, [...] Trode i' the mire out o' sight? [...] But could I like Montgomeries fight, [...] Or gab like Boswell,^2 [...] There's some sark-necks I wad <b>draw</b> <b>tight,</b> [...] An' tie some hose well.|$|R
6000|$|... "You will?" [...] he shouted, in a rapture. [...] "In every way--and always--as {{long as you}} live? Do {{you mean}} it?" [...] He had caught her hand to his breast and was {{grappling}} it <b>tight</b> there and <b>drawing</b> her to him.|$|R
60|$|Ingleby {{dropped on}} one knee, and with clumsy fingers loosed the blanket-cloak. Then he stopped a moment, {{and glanced at}} Leger, who had slipped one arm under Hetty. As she lay, her {{garments}} were <b>drawn</b> <b>tight</b> about her neck and shoulders.|$|R
50|$|After a <b>tight</b> 1-1 <b>draw</b> at the National Ice Centre, the two clubs met in {{the second}} leg at Sheffield Arena on March 17. The Panthers stormed into an early 2-0 lead before the Steelers fought back {{to tie the game}} at 2-2. Regulation time ended level and so the game went into overtime. After 53 seconds, Kim Ahlroos won the game for Nottingham, ending an eight-year wait for the club to defeat their rivals in a showpiece event.|$|R
50|$|In this {{variation}} the knot's {{working end}} is taken round the loop {{in the direction}} of the original round turn, then threaded back up through the original round turn before the knot is <b>drawn</b> <b>tight.</b> The Yosemite bowline is often used in climbing.|$|R
6000|$|I found Clarence {{alone in}} his quarters, drowned in melancholy; and {{in place of the}} {{electric}} light, he had reinstituted the ancient rag-lamp, and sat there in a grisly twilight with all curtains <b>drawn</b> <b>tight.</b> He sprang up and rushed for me eagerly, saying: ...|$|R
60|$|Some fine {{instinct}} that Rome {{must have}} bequeathed to us caused nearly every one {{to turn and}} look at them--there was a subtle feeling that two gladiators had met in the arena. Two or three Give and Takes with <b>tight</b> coat sleeves <b>drew</b> nearer.|$|R
60|$|As {{luck would}} have it, both landed over the mustang's head, but while Dan's was <b>drawn</b> <b>tight</b> with great quickness, Ralph's {{remained}} loose, so that in a twinkle the mustang shook it off, {{and then of course}} the line tightened around Dan's lariat instead.|$|R
5000|$|In The Hague, {{he became}} a strong {{landscape}} painter painting rivers and landscapes with mills and towpaths, and beach views with fishing boats. His stroke became broader and larger and his use of color became more subdued and directed towards portraying the atmospheric depiction of clouds. This part of {{has been compared to}} the seventeenth-century painters Jan van Goyen, Jacob Van Ruisdael and Johannes Vermeer. His way of working has been described in the following way: [...] They say that he paints first and draws only afterwards. He applies the paint thickly, builds it up, fiddles around and messes with it-all gradually developing a harmony of colors that establishes the major directions. Only then does he complete his figures with lively, thin brush strokes. But the final touch is done with a master stroke, and in the end the entire work is as solid as the <b>tightest</b> <b>drawing.</b> [...] Also, M. Philippe Zilcken said, [...] No painter has so well expressed the ethereal effects, bathed in air and light through floating silvery mist, in which painters delight, and the characteristic remote horizons blurred by haze; or again, the grey yet luminous weather of Holland, unlike the dead grey rain of England or the heavy sky of Paris.|$|R
60|$|Slone {{tried to}} call to Lucy to shoot low, but his lips had <b>drawn</b> <b>tight</b> after his one yell. Slone saw her white, rounded {{shoulders}} bent, with cold, white face pressed against the rifle, with slim arms quivering and growing tense, with the tangled golden hair blowing out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Master, look here!" [...] Tearing {{open his}} coat, the youth {{displayed}} his skin, and a leather belt <b>drawn</b> <b>tight</b> round it. Again Swithin felt that desire {{to take to}} his heels. He was filled with horrid forebodings--a sense of perpending intimacy with things such as no gentleman had dealings with.|$|R
60|$|Leonard {{took the}} bag, and opening its mouth, which was <b>drawn</b> <b>tight</b> with a running strip of hide, he peeped into it while Otter held down the candle {{that he might}} see. From its depths came a glimmer of red and blue light that glowed like the heart of some dull fire.|$|R
60|$|Behind her, urged {{on by the}} malevolent {{power of}} the great brain, the {{headless}} body crawled upon all-fours toward her. At last she had reached the aperture. Something seemed {{to tell her that}} once beyond it the domination of the kaldane would be broken. She was almost through into the adjoining chamber when she felt a heavy hand close upon her ankle. The rykor had reached forth and seized her, and though she struggled the thing dragged her back into the room with Luud. It held her <b>tight</b> and <b>drew</b> her close, and then, to her horror, it commenced to caress her.|$|R
5000|$|Raised Increase -- Lift {{the strand}} {{connecting}} two knitted stitches {{in the row}} below onto the left needle (effectively producing a yarn-over) and knit it, either normally or twisted. This method (especially if twisted) leaves almost no hole, since forming the yarn-over stitch from the (presumably <b>tight)</b> connecting strand <b>draws</b> the two neighboring stitches together.|$|R
