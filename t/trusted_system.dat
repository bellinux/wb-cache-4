40|$|Abstract—This paper {{discusses}} {{the use of}} a communications net-work security device, called a <b>trust</b> <b>system,</b> to enhance supervisory control and data-acquisition (SCADA) security. The major goal of the <b>trust</b> <b>system</b> is to increase security with minimal impact on ex-isting utility communication systems. A previous paper focused on the technical operation of the <b>trust</b> <b>system</b> by augmenting routers to protect User Datagram Protocol (UDP) -based traffic. This paper concentrates on placing the <b>trust</b> <b>system</b> into a broader context, creates new <b>trust</b> <b>system</b> implementations to increase its flexibility, and demonstrates the <b>trust</b> <b>system</b> using TCP traffic. Specifically, the article expands on previous work in the following ways: 1) the article summarizes major threats against SCADA systems; 2) it discusses new <b>trust</b> <b>system</b> implementations, which allow the <b>trust</b> <b>system</b> to be used with a wider array of network-enabled equip-ment; 3) it discusses key SCADA security issues in the literature and shows how the <b>trust</b> <b>system</b> responds to such issues; 4) the paper shows the impact of the <b>trust</b> <b>system</b> when widely prevalent TCP/IP network communication is used; and 5) finally, the paper discusses a new hypothetical scenario to illustrate the protection that a <b>trust</b> <b>system</b> provides against insider threats.

40|$|Feedback {{plays an}} {{important}} role in P 2 P <b>trust</b> <b>systems.</b> Existing <b>trust</b> <b>systems</b> usually assume that most of normal peers have idealized feedback behaviors, that is, peers can provide honest feedback after download immediately. However, studies show that feedback sparsity and delay widely exist in a real P 2 P network. Unfortunately, their effect on <b>trust</b> <b>systems</b> has received little attention in previous researches. In this paper, we propose a feedback model considering feedback ratio and feedback delay to analyze the effect. We find that most <b>trust</b> <b>systems</b> have poor reliability when the number of feedbacks is small in a decentralized P 2 P network. We propose an implicit feedback mechanism based on the retention time of files to remove the impact of user feedback on <b>trust</b> <b>systems.</b> Simulation results show that <b>trust</b> <b>systems</b> using implicit feedback can not only effectively isolate normal peers from malicious peers but also provide differential services for normal peers with different behaviors. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The reputation-based trust {{mechanism}} {{is a way}} to assess the trustworthiness of offered services, based on the feedback obtained from their users. In the absence of appropriate safeguards, service users can still manipulate this feedback. Auction mechanisms have already addressed the problem of manipulation by market-trading participants. When auction mechanisms are applied to <b>trust</b> <b>systems,</b> their interaction with the <b>trust</b> <b>systems</b> and associated overhead need to be quantitatively evaluated. This paper proposes two distributed architectures based on centralized and hybrid computing for integrating an auction mechanism with the <b>trust</b> <b>systems.</b> The empirical evaluation demonstrates how the architectures help to discourage users from giving untruthful feedback and reduce the overhead costs of the auction mechanisms.
