6000|$|David did not compose it {{in church}} or in temple. He never meant it, perhaps, to be sung in public worship. He little dreamed that we, and {{millions}} more, in lands {{of which he}} had never heard, should be repeating his words in a foreign tongue in our most sacred acts of worship. He was thinking, when he composed it, mainly of himself and his own sorrows and dangers. He intends, he says, to awake early, and sing it <b>to</b> <b>lute</b> and harp. Perhaps he had composed it in the night, as he lay either in the cave of Adullam or Engedi, hiding from Saul among the cliffs of the wild goats; and meant to go forth to the cave's mouth, and there, before the sun rose over the downs, he would, to translate his words exactly, [...] "awake the dawning" [...] with his song in the free air and the clear sky, singing to his little band of men.|$|E
60|$|Tapestries, he said, {{were to the}} North of Europe what fresco was to the South--our climate, amongst other reasons, guiding us in {{our choice}} of {{material}} for wall-covering. England, France, and Flanders were the three great tapestry countries--Flanders with its great wool trade being the first in splendid colours and superb Gothic design. The keynote of tapestry, the secret of its loveliness, was, he told the audience, the complete filling up of every corner and square inch of surface with lovely and fanciful and suggestive design. Hence the wonder of those great Gothic tapestries where the forest trees rise in different places, one over the other, each leaf perfect in its shape and colour and decorative value, while in simple raiment of beautiful design knights and ladies wandered in rich flower gardens, and rode with hawk on wrist through long green arcades, and sat listening <b>to</b> <b>lute</b> and viol in blossom- starred bowers or by cool gracious water springs. Upon the other hand, when the Gothic feeling died away, and Boucher and others began to design, they gave us wide expanses of waste sky, elaborate perspective, posing nymphs and shallow artificial treatment. Indeed, Boucher met with scant mercy at Mr. Morris's vigorous hands and was roundly abused, and modern Gobelins, with M. Bougereau's cartoons, fared no better.|$|E
50|$|Neusidler, {{along with}} Hans Judenkunig and Hans Gerle, {{was one of}} the most {{important}} early German lutenists. His eight publications feature intabulations of German songs, French chansons, Italian madrigals, dance pieces, and preludes of an improvisatory nature. Most of the works are in three parts, but there are two-part pieces for beginners and a few four-part arrangements in two of his publications. He republished popular works with newer arrangements in his later books. The initial 1536 publication, which was a beginner's collection, opens with a written introduction <b>to</b> <b>lute</b> playing which gives insight into contemporaneous performance practice.|$|E

5000|$|Hill (...) , Lute's young brother, was sickly and {{infected}} with tuberculosis by his step-mother. As the only boy of the family, {{he would be}} the successor of his father. Compared to his elder sister, the boy was cosseted, over-supervised and beaten so that he was weak and unsociable. Most of time, he kept silent to everything around him and no one knew him, even his only elder sister who got along with him every day. Hill died of the negligence of parents, just 17 years old. His death seemed like a secret <b>to</b> <b>Lute</b> to which she never can find the key.|$|E

50|$|Polyphonic {{music is}} idiomatic for the lyra viol. It is most similar <b>to</b> <b>lute</b> music, {{as the number}} of voices can change within a piece, unlike {{harpsichord}} music where the number of voices tends to stay consistent. Since the lyra viol is bowed, all chords must be formed using adjacent strings. This leads to very close harmonic voice leading, which may also be the reason for the frequent unison double stops in lyra viol music, perhaps also intended to imitate the double course of strings on the lute. Since all the chords must be formed using adjacent strings, scordatura tunings are the rule rather than the exception. Almost 60 different tunings from the seventeenth century have been found. They tended to be formulated so as to put the most important notes on open strings, and were composed in sets of pieces, so that players would not have to retune too frequently.|$|E
5000|$|The {{success of}} Jar of Fools came as {{something}} of a surprise <b>to</b> <b>Lutes.</b> On that subject he says: [...] "I think it was well-received partly because I set out specifically to tell a story that could be picked up and read by people who did not usually read comics, and partly because the reader could in some way participate in the same process of discovery I went through in its creation." ...|$|R

5000|$|He was {{probably}} born in Suffolk when the surname was common, if his own statement {{of his age}} may be trusted, was born about 1474. He was educated at Oxford and travelled in England, Scotland and France. On his return his various accomplishments, especially his most excellent vein in poetry, procured him a place at court. He was Groom of the Chamber to Henry VII, as early as 1502. According to Anthony Wood, he could repeat by heart the works {{of most of the}} English poets, especially the poems of John Lydgate, whom he called his master. He was still living in 1521, when it is stated in Henry VIII's household accounts that £6, 13s. 4d. was paid to Mr Hawes for his play, and he died before 1530, when Thomas Field, in his Conversation between a Lover and a Jay, wrote [...] "Yong Steven Hawse, whose soule God pardon, Treated of love so clerkly and well". More recently, some critics, notably C. S. Lewis in his English Literature in the Sixteenth Century Excluding Drama (Oxford University Press, 1944) have treated Hawes dismissively: [...] "faculty was what he lacked; there was more and better poetry in him than he could express", referring to his [...] "broken-backed metre and dull excursions into the seven liberal arts". But his metre is not consistently broken-backed: from time to time (though not very often) one encounters lines that would not have disgraced either Chaucer before him or Spenser after him: [...] "The fragraunt fumes / dyde well encense out // All mysty vapours / of perturbacyon // ore lyker was / her habytacyon // Vnto a place / whiche is celestyall // Than to a terrayne / mancyon fatall" [...] or [...] " [...] By her propre hande / soft as ony sylke // With due obeysaunce / I dyde her than take // Her skynne was whyte / as whalles bone or mylke // My thoughtes was rauysshed / I myght not aslake // My brennynge hert / she the fyre dyde make // These daunces truely / musyke hath me tought // <b>To</b> <b>lute</b> or daunce / but it auayled nought" [...] and so on, where, so long as one pronounces {{at least some of the}} final 'e's, the metre seems to work quite well.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the degree of}} conversion (DC) of dual-curing materials used <b>to</b> <b>lute</b> glass-fiber posts in a simulated root canal polymerized by two different modalities. METHODS: Artificial root canals were used to simulate a clinical condition <b>to</b> <b>lute</b> 45 posts by three different dual curing luting cements (Calibra, Multilink Automix and Variolink II). Two light cure modalities were chosen for each luting cement: standard (S group) 400 mW/cm 2 for 120 seconds and high-power (H group) 1200 mW/cm 2 for 40 seconds. Raman spectra were collected at different positions in the post surface (1, 3, 5 and 7 mm from the coronal-most portion of the post covered in cement) and the percentage degree of conversion was computed. The {{data were analyzed using}} ANOVA and post-hoc Student-Neuman-Keuls t-test (P = 0. 05). RESULTS: The DC of the tested luting composites decreased progressively while increasing the distance from the light tip. Regardless of the polymerization modality (H or S) applied. Conversely, the curing modality significantly influenced the DC of the tested materials, evidencing different responses to the same energy density: Calibra seemed to be less dependent on light-curing than the other tested materials, showing a constant behavior. Multilink Automix reached the highest DCs in the S group compared to the H mode. Variolink II showed an interesting drawback in DC at 7 mm when cured in the H model. Dual-cure materials show adequate monomer conversion but when the distance from the curing light increased, a variable, but significant lowering in conversion rate was observed. In addition, the time and power of curing appeared to be material-dependent and should be calibrated individually...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: This {{in vitro}} study {{evaluated}} the adhesive {{strength of a}} technique <b>to</b> <b>lute</b> implant cylinders to metal frameworks in implant-supported prostheses and ensure a good passive fit. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Different height samples were tested: In group 1, implant cylinders were 5 mm long; in group 2, they were 10 mm long. A universal testing machine (Instron) was used to perform pullout tests. RESULTS: The luting technique provided enough adhesive strength for clinical use with greater adhesive strength in group 2 (mean pull-out strength: 2. 85 kN in group 1 versus 3. 79 kN in group 2). CONCLUSIONS: The luting technique provides enough adhesive strength for clinical use. Moreover, specimens with a larger surface for adhesion demonstrated higher adhesive strength compared with shorter specimens...|$|E
30|$|Eugenol-containing {{materials}} have several advantages as bases for restorations; however, they {{are believed to}} interfere with polymerization during the curing of composite restorations [12, 23]. The hydroxyl group of the eugenol molecule tends to protonize the free radicals formed during the polymerization of resin-based materials, thereby blocking their reactivity and reducing the degree of conversion of these materials [3, 18]. Studies indicated that shear bond strengths were reduced when eugenol-based cements were used <b>to</b> <b>lute</b> temporary crowns or inlays [31, 35], although this point has been contested [19]. Some researchers found eugenol to {{have no effect on}} the shear bond strengths of resin adhesives [1, 19, 30]. Schwartz et al. [38] examined the effects of eugenol and non-eugenol sealers on post-retention and found that the sealer type had no effect.|$|E
