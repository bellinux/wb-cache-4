5|$|A {{challenge}} for future successful GWA {{study is to}} apply <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>in</b> a way that accelerates drug and diagnostics development, including better integration of genetic studies into the drug-development process and {{a focus on the}} role of genetic variation in maintaining health as a blueprint for designing new drugs and diagnostics. Several studies have looked into the use of risk-SNP markers as a means of directly improving the accuracy of prognosis. Some have found that the accuracy of prognosis improves, while others report only minor benefits from this use. Generally, a problem with this direct approach is the small magnitudes of the effects observed. A small effect ultimately translates into a poor separation of cases and controls and thus only a small improvement of prognosis accuracy. An alternative application is therefore the potential for GWA studies to elucidate pathophysiology.|$|E
5|$|Until 1860, {{the only}} known dodo remains were the four {{incomplete}} 17th-century specimens. Philip Burnard Ayres found the first subfossil bones in 1860, which were sent to Richard Owen at the British Museum, who did not publish <b>the</b> <b>findings.</b> <b>In</b> 1863, Owen requested the Mauritian Bishop Vincent Ryan to spread word {{that he should be}} informed if any dodo bones were found. In 1865, George Clark, the government schoolmaster at Mahébourg, finally found an abundance of subfossil dodo bones in the swamp of Mare aux Songes in Southern Mauritius, after a 30-year search inspired by Strickland and Melville's monograph. In 1866, Clark explained his procedure to The Ibis, an ornithology journal: he had sent his coolies to wade through the centre of the swamp, feeling for bones with their feet. At first they found few bones, until they cut away herbage that covered the deepest part of the swamp, where they found many fossils. The swamp yielded the remains of over 300 dodos, but very few skull and wing bones, possibly because the upper bodies were washed away or scavenged while the lower body was trapped. The situation is similar to many finds of moa remains in New Zealand marshes. Most dodo remains from the Mare aux Songes have a medium to dark brown colouration.|$|E

30|$|In this section, we {{conduct a}} {{simulation}} exercise {{to learn about}} the implications {{of the structure of the}} global buyer-supplier network, which we studied in the previous sections, for the proliferation of conflict minerals. Our analysis in the previous sections suggest the following. First, <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> <b>in</b> Section  3 (i.e., the link distribution has a power law tail) suggests that a small number of firms with an extremely large number of links play an important role in the proliferation of conflict minerals. Second, <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> <b>in</b> Section  4 (i.e., most firms are connected within six links) suggests that the proliferation of conflict minerals may be surprisingly quick. Third, <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> <b>in</b> Section  5 (i.e., firms within an industry – rather than within a country – tends to form a community) suggests that national borders do not matter for the proliferation of conflict minerals. Combined together, our analysis suggests that it is critically important to identify key firms located at the very upstream of the conflict mineral supply chain and to regulate transactions associated with these firms.|$|R

A 2003 meta-analysis of 30 randomized trials of menopausal HRT in relation to mortality showed that it was associated with a nearly 40% reduction in mortality in trials in which participants had a mean age of less than 60 yr or were within 10 yr of menopause onset but was unrelated to mortality in the other trials. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> <b>in</b> the younger age groups were similar to those in the observational Nurses' Health Study (RR for mortality, 0.63; CI, 0.56nbsp&– 0.70).|$|E
25|$|In 2010 the Waitangi Tribunal began {{hearings}} {{into the}} Ngāpuhi's claim that sovereignty {{was not given}} up in their signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. The Tribunal, in Te Paparahi o te Raki inquiry (Wai 1040), is considering the Māori and Crown understandings of He Whakaputanga o te Rangatiratanga / The Declaration of Independence 1835 and Te Tiriti o Waitangi / the Treaty of Waitangi. The Te Paparahi o Te Raki stage 1 inquiry hearings phase was intended to reach conclusions as to the meaning and effect of the treaty for the Crown and Te Raki Māori in 1840. The key conclusion of the stage 1 report was that the treaty signatories did not cede sovereignty in February 1840. ‘That is, they did not cede authority to make and enforce law over their people or their territories.’ The rangatira did, however, agree ‘to share power and authority with Britain’. The consequences of <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>in</b> the stage 1 report are being considered in the Te Raki stage 2 inquiry including considering {{the immediate aftermath of}} the Treaty of Waitangi, the Northern War (1844–46) and Crown pre-emption.|$|E
25|$|Impairments in impulse {{control in}} binge drinkers, {{which is more}} {{prominent}} in female binge drinkers, is due to dysfunction of the frontal lobe. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> <b>in</b> humans have been largely concordant with animal studies. Such animal studies find that heavy and regular binge drinking causes neurodegeneration in corticolimbic brain regions areas {{that are involved in}} learning and spatial memory, such as the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, perirhinal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and the hippocampal dentate gyrus. A study in rats found that a heavy 2-day drinking binge caused extensive neurodegeneration in the entorhinal cortex with resultant learning deficits. While brain damage from binge drinking is known to occur as a result of binge drinking patterns, it is unclear how long drinking sessions last and how regular binge drinking is done to cause brain damage in humans. One study found that humans who drank at least 100 drinks (male) or 80 drinks (female) per month (concentrated to 21 occasions or less per month) throughout a 3-year period had impaired decision making skills compared to non-binge drinkers. Repeated acute withdrawal from alcohol, which occurs in heavy binge drinkers, has been shown in several studies to be associated with cognitive deficits as a result of neural kindling; neural kindling due to repeated withdrawals {{is believed to be the}} mechanism of cognitive damage in both binge drinkers and alcoholics. Neuronal kindling also leads to each subsequent acute withdrawal episode being more severe than previous withdrawal episodes.|$|E
