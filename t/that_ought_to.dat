5|$|Silvestre de Sacy {{eventually}} gave up {{work on the}} stone, but he was to {{make another}} contribution. In 1811, prompted by discussions with a Chinese student about Chinese script, Silvestre de Sacy considered a suggestion made by Georg Zoëga in 1797 that the foreign names in Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions might be written phonetically; he also recalled that as early as 1761, Jean-Jacques Barthélemy had suggested that the characters enclosed in cartouches in hieroglyphic inscriptions were proper names. Thus, when Thomas Young, foreign secretary of the Royal Society of London, wrote {{to him about the}} stone in 1814, Silvestre de Sacy suggested in reply that in attempting to read the hieroglyphic text, Young might look for cartouches <b>that</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> contain Greek names and try to identify phonetic characters in them.|$|E

25|$|Zimmer Comes to the Front With an Indoor GameCharley Zimmer, the good-natured and gentlemanly catcher of the Cleveland Club has invented and {{patented}} {{an indoor}} game of base ball <b>that</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> {{make him a}} little fortune. It promises {{to become one of}} the greatest toys of the age. A regular game can be played. The ball is pitched from an ingenious device and goes straight over the plate. If a hit isn't made or the ball struck at all the 'catcher' gets it. All the 'players' are in position, and there are regular catches in the outfield and pick-ups in the infield. The bat is a curious contrivance, and it takes good judgment to operate it. A fast or slow ball can be pitched, and the batter is liable to be 'fooled' by changes of pace. Nothing like it was ever seen before in toy games. The invention is to be shown in Hudson's window after Thanksgiving, and will surely attract great attention.|$|E

Based on the group a Ghanaian contributor may fall in, there is specific premium <b>that</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be paid. This was done since the socio-economic condition scheme contributors {{is not the same}} and the Ghanaian contributions was to be affordable for all to ensure that nobody is forced to remain in cash and carry system. This meant that Ghanaian contributions payable could vary from one district to the other as even the disease burden was also not the same in all the districts. To ensure that all Ghanaian citizens made some contribution to the scheme, a 2.5% Health Insurance Levy on selected goods and services was passed into law so that the money collected could be put into a National Health Insurance Fund to subsidize fully paid contributions to the District Health Insurance Schemes.|$|E
25|$|It {{must surely}} have a deplorable effect upon our Allies {{to be told}} by an ex-Cabinet Minister that the Palestine Administration do not like Jews, {{and that there are}} enough anti-Semites in Great Britain to back up the Hitler policy and spirit. This {{suggestion}} is a complete reversal of the truth. If a comparison is to be made with the Nazis, it is surely those who wish to force an imported régime upon the Arab population who are guilty of the spirit of aggression and domination. Lord Wedgwood's proposal that Arabs should be subjugated by force to a Jewish régime is inconsistent with the Atlantic Charter, and <b>that</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be told to America.

It is composed in the key of G major, and contains a metronome of 128 beats per minute. Musically, it carries out a chord progression of D–Em–Bm–C, while the group members' vocal ranges go from the notes of G3 to E5.

Griswold also wrote the first biography of Poe in which he purposely set out to ruin the dead author's reputation. Willis {{was one of the most}} vocal of Poe's defenders, writing at one point: [...] "The indictment (for it deserves no other name) is not true. It is full of cruel misrepresentations.

[...] In his operas and elsewhere, Grove, Parry and later commentators found music <b>that</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> convey love and romance failing to do so. Like Parry, Stanford strove for seriousness, and his competitive streak led him to emulate Sullivan not in comic opera, for which Stanford had a real gift, but in oratorio in what Rodmell calls grand statements that [...] "only occasionally matched worthiness with power or profundity." ...|$|E

He also criticized the frequent Costco promotion. Phipps praised Ayoade: [...] "...he lends an unpredictable element to the group dynamic, and to the film.

[...] Varietys Justin Chang complimented {{the interaction between the}} four leads, but criticized the film for relegating ethnic characters to murder victims and female characters [...] "to be protected or consoled".

[...] However, Warren Giles, then-chairman of the Hall of Fame's Veterans Committee, pointed out to baseball historian Bob Broeg in 1972 that induction to the Hall required [...] "participation in ten championship seasons." [...] Joss {{had been on the}} Cleveland roster in 1911 and participated in spring training, falling ill just before regular season play commenced. Hence it was argued he had [...] "participated" [...] in the 1911 season, his tenth. The Hall's Board of Directors waived the eligibility requirements for Joss. Joe Reichler, a member of the Commissioner's office, worked to allow Joss to become eligible for the Hall and succeeded in 1977. Joss was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1978. He is the only player in the Hall of Fame whose regular season playing career lasted fewer than ten years.|$|E
