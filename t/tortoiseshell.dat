5|$|The {{figure of}} Hope holds a broken lyre, {{based on an}} ancient Athenian wood and <b>tortoiseshell</b> lyre then {{on display in the}} British Museum. Although broken musical {{instruments}} were a frequently occurring motif in European art, they had never previously been associated with Hope. Hope's lyre has only a single string remaining, on which she attempts to play. She strains to listen {{to the sound of the}} single unbroken string, symbolising both persistence and fragility, and the closeness of hope and despair. Watts had recently shown interest in the idea of a continuity between the visual arts and music, and had previously made use of musical instruments as a way to invigorate the subjects of his portraits.|$|E
5|$|The Antankarana were {{historically}} {{fishermen and}} pastoralist zebu herders, although {{in recent years}} most have become agriculturalists. Sea fishing is carried out in two-man canoes made from a single hollowed out log. Antankarana fishermen used these canoes to hunt whales, turtles and fish. They also used nets to hunt in rivers, where they could catch eels, fish, crayfish and other food sources. Salt production was historically a major economic activity. Historically the Antankarana engaged in trading with European seafarers, exchanging <b>tortoiseshell</b> for guns. Today, {{while the majority of}} Antankarana continue to work in these traditional sectors – especially the highly lucrative shrimp fishing business or the growing of sugarcane – many are wage laborers. More highly educated community members, particularly among the noble class, work in salaried positions as government officials, teachers {{and a variety of other}} trades and professions. The SIRAMA national sugar company factories are located in Antankarana territory and employ many migrants, but relatively few Antankarana as their standard of living on average is high enough to be able to pursue better opportunities.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to common {{wood and metal}} needles, antique knitting needles were sometimes made from <b>tortoiseshell,</b> ivory and walrus tusks; these materials are now banned due to their impact on endangered species, and needles made from them are virtually impossible to find.|$|E
50|$|Aglais is a Holarctic genus of brush-footed butterflies, {{containing}} the <b>tortoiseshells.</b> This genus is sometimes {{included as a}} subgenus of Nymphalis, which also includes <b>tortoiseshells,</b> but it is usually considered to be separate.|$|R
50|$|Nymphalis, {{commonly}} known as the <b>tortoiseshells</b> or anglewing butterflies, is a genus of brush-footed butterflies. The genera Aglais, Inachis, Polygonia and Kaniska, were sometimes included as subgenera of Nymphalis but they are by some people considered to be unique genera. See also anglewing butterflies. For other butterflies named <b>tortoiseshells,</b> see the genus, Aglais.|$|R

25|$|Natural chimeras {{are almost}} never {{detected}} unless they exhibit abnormalities such as male/female or hermaphrodite characteristics or uneven skin pigmentation. The most noticeable are some male <b>tortoiseshell</b> cats (although most male tortoiseshells {{have an extra}} X chromosome responsible for the colouration) or animals with ambiguous sex organs.|$|E
25|$|Burial 1 {{dates to}} the Postclassic. It was {{excavated}} in a possible residential patio {{among a group of}} small buildings {{at the south end of}} Topoxte island. It was possibly interred in a seated position. The remains belong to an adult male aged between 15 and 25 years old and were found buried with fragments of <b>tortoiseshell.</b>|$|E
25|$|Whilst many early virginals {{throughout}} Europe {{were left}} in plain wood, they were soon provided with rich decoration, which {{may have contributed to}} the survival of many such instruments. From mouldings on case edges, jackrails and namebattens to adornment with ivory, mother-of-pearl, marble, agate, <b>tortoiseshell</b> or semi-precious stones, not to mention intricate painting, no expense was spared by those who could afford it.|$|E
5000|$|Nymphalini is a {{tribe of}} nymphalid brush-footed butterflies. Common names include admirals, anglewings, commas, and <b>tortoiseshells,</b> {{but none of}} these is {{specific}} to one particular genus.|$|R
50|$|The country's main library, the National Library of China, {{housed a}} rich {{collection}} of books, periodicals, newspapers, maps, prints, photographs, manuscripts, microforms, tape recordings, and inscriptions on bronze, stone, bones, and <b>tortoiseshells.</b>|$|R
50|$|Milbert's <b>tortoiseshell's</b> range {{includes}} all of Canada and Alaska {{south of the}} tundra, all of the western United States {{and most of the}} eastern United States. In these areas they commonly occur in wet areas, including moist pastures, marshes, most trails, and roadsides.|$|R
25|$|On the Portuguese guitar {{the strings}} are picked with {{the corner of}} the fingernails, {{avoiding}} contact of the flesh with the strings. The unused fingers of the picking hand rest below the strings, on the soundboard. Most players use various materials in place of natural fingernails; these fingerpicks were traditionally made of <b>tortoiseshell,</b> but today are usually nylon or plastic.|$|E
25|$|Simultaneously, Mary F. Lyon began {{investigating}} {{manipulations of}} X-linked traits that had phenotypically visible consequences, particularly in mice, whose fur color is a trait intimately {{linked to the}} X chromosome. Building on work done by Ohno and his colleagues, Lyon eventually proved that either the maternal or paternal X chromosome is randomly inactivated in every cell of the female body in the species she was studying, which explained the heterogeneous fur patterns she observed in her mosaic mice. This process is known as X-inactivation, and is {{sometimes referred to as}} “lyonization”. This discovery can be easily extrapolated to explain the mixed color patterns observed in the coats of <b>tortoiseshell</b> cats. The fur patterns characteristic of <b>tortoiseshell</b> cats are found almost exclusively in females, because only they randomly inactivate one X chromosome in every somatic hair cell. Thus, presuming that hair color determining genes are X-linked, it makes sense that whether the maternal or paternal X chromosome is inactivated in a particular hair cell can result in differential fur color expression.|$|E
25|$|Only {{two types}} of seal are found on County Wexford's coast—Atlantic grey seals are very {{plentiful}} in coastal areas, but the slightly smaller common (or harbour) seal is less common, yet plentiful. The small <b>tortoiseshell</b> butterfly (reddish-orange colour, with black markings) {{is the most common}} species of butterfly in the county. Various types of moth are also common. The common frog is plentiful, and is the only type of frog found.|$|E
50|$|This meadow {{has never}} been {{ploughed}} and it is managed in a traditional way to encourage uncommon plants, such as great burnet and pepper-saxifrage. There are amphibians including frogs and toads, and butterflies including meadow browns, orange-tips, peacocks, ringlets and small <b>tortoiseshells.</b>|$|R
5|$|While brown cats with ticked coats can {{occasionally}} be seen, {{few if any}} {{resembles the}} Singapura, {{with the majority of}} cats being bobtailed tabbies, <b>tortoiseshells</b> or bicolor, and the move by the STPB is seen by locals to be an advertising move based on the popularity of the breed among tourists at that time.|$|R
50|$|This wetland site is {{the result}} of a spring, which has {{resulted}} in the growth of peat over many years into a rare domed structure called a rheotrophic hangmire. The dominant plants are tussock sedge and marsh marigold. There are birds such as long-tailed tits and great tits, and butterflies including large whites and small <b>tortoiseshells.</b>|$|R
25|$|The area {{is rich in}} wildlife. Insects {{found here}} that are scarce in the UK include the {{bleached}} pug (Eupithecia expallidata) and alder kitten (Furcula bicuspis) moths, {{as well as the}} soldier beetle species Malthius frontalis. Locally scarce insects include the green hairstreak butterfly (Callophrys rubi) and the common glow-worm (Lampyris noctiluca). The site provides a habitat for butterflies, with common species including the comma, gatekeeper, red admiral, speckled wood and <b>tortoiseshell.</b>|$|E
25|$|The male {{does not}} engorge. The shield (scutum) covers the entire dorsal body. It has a <b>tortoiseshell</b> pattern. The {{mouthparts}} section (the capitulum) is very short {{because it is}} not required for feeding from the host (though it may be used to feed from the female tick). The male tick does not pose a medical risk to humans or animals - the significance of finding a male is that it is looking for a female - so humans and animals should be checked fully for the possible presence of an adult female tick somewhere.|$|E
25|$|The Comoros {{served as}} a way station for merchants sailing to the Far East and India until {{the opening of the}} Suez Canal {{significantly}} reduced traffic passing through the Mozambique Channel. The native commodities exported by the Comoros were coconuts, cattle and <b>tortoiseshell.</b> French settlers, French-owned companies, and wealthy Arab merchants established a plantation-based economy that used about one-third of the land for export crops. After its annexation, France converted Mayotte into a sugar plantation colony. The other islands were soon transformed as well, and the major crops of ylang-ylang, vanilla, coffee, cocoa beans, and sisal were introduced.|$|E
50|$|The {{variable}} checkerspot is {{a member}} of the order Lepidoptera, which contains the butterflies and the moths. It belongs to the family Nymphalidae, which also includes the <b>tortoiseshells</b> and the admirals. The variable checkerspot is part of the genus Euphydryas, which contains other checkerspot butterflies like Euphydryas editha and Euphydryas phaeton. There are ten subspecies of Euphydryas chalcedona. Additional information is required to determine the conservation status of some subspecies.|$|R
50|$|Holz is most {{known for}} his black and white nudes, {{which he has been}} {{shooting}} since 1974 and which have been exhibited widely. Many of the nudes are shot at Holz' farm in Upstate New York, with the subjects posed outside in nature. Holz began a unique project photographing nudes posed with animal bones, <b>tortoiseshells,</b> and antlers, contrasting living flesh with ancient relics. He also photographed nudes with found objects, juxtaposing the natural and the manmade.|$|R
40|$|Highlights: Wet and windy weather {{with low}} {{sunshine}} levels caused problems for most butterfly species. The year ranked {{as the second}} worst in the 33 -year series and the sorst since 1981. 12 species had their worst year, with continued declines for Small <b>Tortoiseshells</b> {{and some of our}} most threatened species, including several of the fritillaries. There was a noticeable absence of migrants after several good years. On the positive side it was good year for some of the Brons including Ringlet and Speckled Wood...|$|R
25|$|Other colors {{have been}} {{developed}} from this initial base set, {{with varying degrees of}} popularity and recognition. In 1989 a cinnamon breeding programme was started in the Netherlands; the first fawn kitten was born in 1998. Cinnamon, fawn, caramel, and apricot Burmese have also been developed in New Zealand, as have <b>tortoiseshell</b> variants of all these colors. A new colour mutation has arisen in Burmese lines being bred in New Zealand and an experimental breeding programme began in 2007. The colour is called russet and appears {{to be the result of}} the dark pigment in the cats' coats fading as they grow, while paler orange pigment remains.|$|E
25|$|It {{was once}} {{noted for its}} cutlery, shoe and bonnet workshops, and there were iron and coal mines in the neighbourhood. A hanger {{is a type of}} hunting sword, the only {{remaining}} Scottish example of which was made in Kilmaurs; it is in the keeping of the Kelvingrove Museum in Glasgow. The hanger sword is marked 'Kilmares' and is marked 'DB' for the maker or cutler, David Biggart, who also made knives and forks. This sword is highly ornate with the grip made of <b>tortoiseshell</b> with floral patterns in extremely fine twisted silver wire. Fork over fork, is part of the kilmaurs coat of arms, relating to the history of the village cutlery heritage and for forking out prisoners and those hiding in hay to avoid capture.|$|E
25|$|Large {{vertical}} drums (which the Aztecs called huehuetl) {{were made}} of wood and did not survive. The much lower standing kettle drums {{that have been found}} - often shaped like a bulbous jar on a pedestal, single or double - are earthenware. In depictions, the membrane is sometimes shown to consist of a jaguar pelt. In the Late-Postclassic Dresden Codex (34a), the drum connects to an open resonance chamber without membrane. Another type of kettle drum was portable and held under the arm. The horizontal slit-drums (tun, Aztec teponaztli) appear only after the close of the Classic Period, probably under Toltec influence. In addition there were <b>tortoiseshell</b> and turtleshell drums played with the hand (Herrera), or with a stick such as a deer antler.|$|E
40|$|Senior seminar (D. V. M.) [...] Cornell University, 1982. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 13 - 14). The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide the small animal practitioner or cat fancier with an introduction to the genetics of feline coat color. It is assumed that the reader has a basic understanding of simple Mendelian genetics. Various coat colors and patterns are discussed including tabbies, solid colors, Burmese, Siamese, <b>tortoiseshells,</b> shaded and tipped colors. There is also a discussion on the genetics of coat length and texture...|$|R
50|$|The Kingdom of Sardinia's {{greatest}} son in {{the field}} of Rococo interior designing was without a doubt Pietro Piffetti (1700-1770), who made Sardinian Rococo so refined and elegant. His works and designs were so high-quality that he was envied across Italy and was a serious contender to French craftsmen and furniture-designers. His famous designs emerged as being Sardinian/Piedmontese and were famous for their highly intricate designs, exotic materials, flamboyant cartouches and the unique <b>tortoiseshells,</b> which became popular under Rococo zenith. Despite this, Rococo interior designing in Piedmont and Turin remained virtually identical to that of France, its closest neighbour.|$|R
50|$|Hafun {{has been}} {{identified}} as the ancient trading port of Opone, which was described in the 1st century CE Greek travelogue the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. Pottery found by an expedition led by Neville Chittick, in Oponean tombs at Damo, date back to the Mycenaean kingdom of Greece that flourished between the 16th century BC. Merchants from as far afield as Indonesia and Malaysia in the Far East also passed through the settlement. By the 50 CE, the area was well known as a centre for the cinnamon trade, along with the barter of cloves and other spices, ivory, exotic animal hides, and incense. It also traded in <b>tortoiseshells.</b>|$|R
25|$|Among the {{earliest}} accounts of East Africa, {{the works of}} Al-Masudi describe early Islamic trade routes, and how the coast and islands were frequently visited by Muslims including Persian and Arab merchants and sailors in search of coral, ambergris, ivory, <b>tortoiseshell,</b> gold and slaves. They also brought Islam {{to the people of}} the Zanj including the Comoros. As the importance of the Comoros grew along the East African coast, both small and large mosques were constructed. Despite its distance from the coast, the Comoros is situated along the Swahili Coast in East Africa. It was a major hub of trade and an important location in a network of trading towns that included Kilwa, in present-day Tanzania, Sofala (an outlet for Zimbabwean gold), in Mozambique, and Mombasa in Kenya.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} blastocyst, this initial, {{imprinted}} X-inactivation is reversed in {{the cells of}} the inner cell mass (which give rise to the embryo), and in these cells both X chromosomes become active again. Each of these cells then independently and randomly inactivates one copy of the X chromosome. This inactivation event is irreversible during the lifetime of the cell, so all the descendants of a cell which inactivated a particular X chromosome will also inactivate that same chromosome. This phenomenon, which can be observed in the coloration of <b>tortoiseshell</b> cats when females are heterozygous for the X-linked gene, {{should not be confused with}} mosaicism, which is a term that specifically refers to differences in the genotype of various cell populations in the same individual; X-inactivation, which is an epigenetic change that results in a different phenotype, is not a change at the genotypic level. For an individual cell or lineage the inactivation is therefore skewed or 'non-random', and this can give rise to mild symptoms in female 'carriers' of X-linked genetic disorders.|$|E

50|$|Danaus erippus is {{included}} with other Nymphalidae, the largest family of butterflies with about 6000 species distributed {{throughout most of}} the world. It has a reduced pair of forelegs, is brightly coloured, and {{is included}} with popular species such as the emperors, admirals, <b>tortoiseshells,</b> and fritillaries. Its wingspan reaches about 110 mm, with an easily recognizable orange and black pattern. Until 2007, this butterfly was treated as a subspecies of Danaus plexippus. These species are very similar, but D. erippus usually has an orange trailing edge of the forewings, while in D. plexippus it is black. The lineages of the two species are thought to have separated about 2 million years ago. The colour of the wings in males of the southern monarch is paler than in the females.|$|R
25|$|The Nymphalidae are {{the largest}} family of {{butterflies}} with about 6,000 species distributed {{throughout most of the}} world, belonging to the superfamily Papilionoidea. These are usually medium-sized to large butterflies. Most species have a reduced pair of forelegs and many hold their colourful wings flat when resting. They are also called brush-footed butterflies or four-footed butterflies, because they are known to stand on only four legs while the other two are curled up; in some species, these forelegs have a brush-like set of hairs, which gives this family its other common name. Many species are brightly coloured and include popular species such as the emperors, monarch butterfly, admirals, <b>tortoiseshells,</b> and fritillaries. However, the under wings are, in contrast, often dull and in some species look remarkably like dead leaves, or are much paler, producing a cryptic effect that helps the butterflies blend into their surroundings.|$|R
500|$|The hawksbill's {{appearance}} {{is similar to}} that of other marine turtles. In general, it has a flattened body shape, a protective carapace, and flipper-like limbs, adapted for swimming in the open ocean. E. imbricata is easily distinguished from other sea turtles by its sharp, curving beak with prominent tomium, and the [...] appearance of its shell margins. Hawksbill shells slightly change colors, depending on water temperature. While this turtle lives part of its life in the open ocean, it spends more time in shallow lagoons and coral reefs. The World Conservation Union, primarily as a result of Human fishing practices, classifies E. imbricata as critically endangered. [...] Hawksbill shells were the primary source of <b>tortoiseshell</b> material used for decorative purposes. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species outlaws the capture and trade of hawksbill sea turtles and products derived from them.|$|E
