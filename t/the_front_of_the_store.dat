5|$|The {{first call}} from the scene to {{emergency}} services was received at 10:11a.m. While waiting for help to arrive, Giffords' intern Daniel Hernández Jr. applied pressure to the gunshot wound on her forehead, and made sure she did not choke on her blood. Hernández was credited with saving Giffords' life. David and Nancy Bowman, a married doctor and nurse who were shopping in the store, immediately set up triage and attended to nine-year-old Christina-Taylor Green. Police {{arrived on the scene}} at 10:15a.m., with paramedics arriving at 10:16a.m. Badger observed the assailant attempting to discard a small bag containing money and identification, which was recovered by the officers. Following the shooting, the police shut down roads surrounding the shopping center until late in the day. The intersection was cordoned off and most of the businesses in the shopping center were closed throughout the weekend during the initial investigation. The Safeway store reopened a week later, with a makeshift memorial erected near <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some fire {{experts have}} {{questioned}} why the exterior front windows {{were taken out}} by firefighters while crews were committed inside, an action that could have increased the amount of oxygen being fed to the fire and drawn flames to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store.</b> Assistant Fire Chief Larry Garvin stated that fire blew out the windows, at which time firefighters broke open more windows to allow firefighters to escape.|$|E
25|$|Retail {{designers}} {{pay close}} attention to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store,</b> which is known as the decompression zone. This is usually an open space in the entrance of the store to allow customers to adjust to their new environment. An open-plan floor design is effective in retail as it allows customers to see everything. In terms of the store's exterior, {{the side of the road}} cars normally travel, determines the way stores direct customers. New Zealand retail stores, for instance, would direct customers to the left.|$|E

2500|$|The new [...] "Horizon" [...] stores {{abandoned}} the original showroom experience for a brighter, more-open sales-floor format with open ceilings, low fixtures, and wood-floor aisles to allow customers to browse the merchandise easily. The format allowed putting all {{products on the}} sales floor, except those that were too large for customers to carry themselves. Shopping carts were added for the expanded assortment of grab-and-go merchandise. A row of registers was located at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> {{for the first time}} for quick checkout. Previously, the stores only had registers located within each department since the salespeople were on commission. Even though the new format had commissioned sales people, it was becoming very similar to Best Buy.|$|E
2500|$|American Fare was a {{chain of}} hypermarkets that opened in January 1989. American Fare was {{a joint venture between}} Kmart (which owned 51 percent), and Birmingham, Alabama-based Bruno's Supermarkets. The first store opened near Atlanta, Georgia. American Fare's [...] of retail space {{included}} [...] of groceries, [...] of general merchandise, and [...] of clothing (including apparel, footwear, and accessories). [...] An area in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> housed a music and video store, a food court, bank, hair salon, pharmacy and a card store. Charlotte, North Carolina, was home to the second American Fare, which opened in late 1989 with [...] of retail space. A third and final store opened in Jackson, Mississippi. In June 1992, Bruno's announced that its partnership with the Kmart Corporation was being terminated, and that Kmart would assume ownership of the three stores. The Charlotte, NC store was converted to Super Kmart and then closed in 2002. The American Fare brand is used on some Kmart store brand consumable products.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the 2011 Joplin tornado in which the walls of a Home Depot {{collapsed}} in Joplin after being hit by an EF5 tornado, The Kansas City Star, citing engineers, criticized Home Depot's practice of using tilt-up construction in hundreds of its big-box stores (other nearby big-box stores in Joplin, including a Walmart and Academy Sports, which had concrete block construction, lost their roofs but the walls remained intact). In tilt-up construction the concrete is poured onsite, lifted into place, and then attached to the roof. The engineers told the Star that the practice, while normally safe and efficient, is dangerous in major storms because once the roof is lifted (as happened in Joplin) the walls collapse in a domino effect. [...] Seven people were killed in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> when the 100,000-pound walls collapsed on them, while 28 people {{in the back of the}} store survived when those walls collapsed outward. Only two of the slab walls in the Home Depot survived. In contrast, 3 people died in the Walmart but 200 survived. Engineers noted that when concrete block construction fails, structural elements break in pieces and usually not in huge slabs. [...] Home Depot said it fundamentally disagreed with the engineers quoted by the Star and said it would use tilt-up construction when it rebuilds the Joplin store.|$|E

50|$|When {{referring}} to cars, <b>the</b> left-hand side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car is {{the side that}} corresponds with the driver's left, {{as seen from the}} driver's seat.

60|$|When next I awoke, {{a sickly}} yellow light was {{filtering}} in on me. It was {{dawn of the}} second day. I crept to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store.</b> A smoke pall, shot through with lurid gleams, filled the sky. Down {{the opposite side of}} the street tottered a wretched slave. One hand he held tightly against his side, and behind him he left a bloody trail. His eyes roved everywhere, and they were filled with apprehension and dread. Once he looked straight across at me, and in his face was all the dumb pathos of the wounded and hunted animal. He saw me, but there was no kinship between us, and with him, at least, no sympathy of understanding; for he cowered perceptibly and dragged himself on. He could expect no aid in all God's world. He was a helot in the great hunt of helots that the masters were making. All he could hope for, all he sought, was some hole to crawl away in and hide like any animal. The sharp clang of a passing ambulance at the corner gave him a start. Ambulances were not for such as he. With a groan of pain he threw himself into a doorway. A minute later he was out again and desperately hobbling on.|$|E
60|$|Then he recollected {{that some}} of his neighbors were {{addicted}} to dumping empty provision cans and similar refuse into a clump of willows which straggled close up {{to the back of the}} town not far away, and he decided that one of them had fallen down or rolled over. After that he went back to his table, leaving the door open for the sake of coolness, and he was once more occupied with his papers when he heard a sharp knocking at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store.</b> Pushing his chair back he took out his watch. Somebody who was going west by the train that was almost due apparently desired to see him, though it seemed a curious thing that the man had not called earlier. He rose and entered the store, where he fell against the projecting handle of a plow in the darkness. This ruffled his temper, and he spent some time impatiently fumbling for and undoing the fastenings of the outer door. Then he flung it open somewhat violently, and strode out into the darkness. There was, so far as he could see, nobody in the vicinity, and when, moving forward a few paces he called out, he got no answer.|$|E

60|$|His fall {{broke the}} spell. Even Blue, like the gunman he was, had paused to watch Jorth {{in his last}} mortal action. Jorth's {{followers}} began to draw and shoot. Jean saw Blue's return fire bring down a huge man, who fell across Jorth's body. Then Jean, quick as the thought that actuated him, raised his rifle and shot at the big lamp. It burst in a flare. It crashed to the floor. Darkness followed--a blank, thick, enveloping mantle. Then red flashes of guns emphasized the blackness. Inside the store there broke loose a pandemonium of shots, yells, curses, and thudding boots. Jean shoved his rifle barrel inside the door and, holding it low down, he moved it to and fro while he worked lever and trigger until the magazine was empty. Then, drawing his six-shooter, he emptied that. A roar of rifles from <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> told Jean that his comrades had entered the fray. Bullets zipped through the door he had broken. Jean ran swiftly round the corner, taking care to sheer off {{a little to the}} left, and when he got clear of the building he saw a line of flashes {{in the middle of the}} road. Blaisdell and the others were firing into the door of the store. With nimble fingers Jean reloaded his rifle. Then swiftly he ran across the road and down to get behind his comrades. Their shooting had slackened. Jean saw dark forms coming his way.|$|E
