Anne was an unusually educated and {{intellectual}} woman for her time, and was keenly absorbed and engaged {{with the ideas of}} the Protestant Reformers, though the extent <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>she</b> herself was a committed Protestant is much debated. When Archbishop of Canterbury William Warham died, Anne's influence and the need to find a trustworthy supporter of the annulment had Thomas Cranmer appointed to the vacant position. This was approved by the Pope, unaware of the King's nascent plans for the Church.|$|E

5|$|In all, Ferraro served three two-year terms, being re-elected in 1980 and 1982. Her vote shares {{increased}} to 58percent and then 73percent {{and much of}} her funding came from political action committees. While Ferraro's pro-choice views conflicted with those of many of her constituents {{as well as the}} Catholic Church <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>she</b> belonged, her positions on other social and foreign policy issues were in alignment with the district. She broke with her party in favoring an anti-busing amendment to the Constitution. She supported deployment of the PershingII missile and the Trident submarine, although she opposed funding for the MX missile, the B-1B bomber, and the Strategic Defense Initiative.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} from a summer visit to Los Altos, California, Rona received a vague telegram from the Institute of Optics at the University of Rochester referencing war work and polonium, but no details of an assignment. When Rona responded {{that she would be}} interested in helping with the war effort but had immigration issues, a man identifying himself as Brian O'Bryen appeared in her office and explained the nature of the confidential work for the Manhattan Project. They proposed buying her method of polonium extraction and gave specific instructions for the type of assistants she might use — someone unfamiliar with chemistry or physics. Her non-citizen status did not preclude her from working for the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>she</b> gave her methods without compensation. Before the Manhattan Project, polonium had been used only in small samples, but the project proposed to use both polonium and beryllium to create a reaction forcing neutrons to be ejected and ignite the fission reaction required for the atom bomb. Plutonium plants, based on her specifications for what was needed to process element, were built in the New Mexico desert at Los Alamos National Laboratory, but Rona was given no details.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Ono's {{family moved}} without her to Scarsdale, New York, an {{affluent}} town 25 {{miles north of}} mid-town Manhattan. When she later rejoined her family in the U.S., she enrolled at nearby Sarah Lawrence College.

In spite of her parents' disapproval, Ono loved meeting artists, poets, and others who represented the bohemian lifestyle <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>she</b> aspired. She visited galleries and art happenings in the city; this whetted her desire to publicly display her own artistic endeavors. American avant-garde artist, composer, and musician La Monte Young was her first important contact in the New York art world; he helped Ono start her career by using her Chambers Street loft in Tribeca as a performance space. After Ono set a painting on fire at one performance, her mentor John Cage advised her to treat the paper with flame retardant.|$|E
