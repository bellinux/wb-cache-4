5|$|According to Israeli {{historian}} Anita Shapira, {{there is}} a gap, at times quite wide, between the 'facts established by historical research' {{and the image of}} the battle as retained in collective memory. This is certainly <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> the battle of Latrun, which has become, in Israel, a founding myth.|$|E
5|$|All rock now {{exposed in}} the area of the park is volcanic, but this has not always been <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> <b>For</b> {{hundreds}} of millions of years, the Lassen region underwent repeated uplifting to form mountains, only to have them worn down and submerged under encroaching seas. During the periods of submersion, sand, mud and limestone were deposited. Occasionally volcanic activity was associated with the mountain building.|$|E
5|$|Doctor Who is unusual, however, in {{that each}} of its 97 missing episodes survives in audio form, {{recorded}} off-air by fans at home. Most episodes are also represented by stills or short video clips. Furthermore, after careful restoration, all 1970s episodes exist in full colour, which is not always <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> other series.|$|E

30|$|The most messaged {{friend has}} the same gender in the 44.2 % of <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>for</b> male users and in the 77.1 % of <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>for</b> female users. For women the {{percentage}} {{is higher than the}} one observed in the interaction network (67.3 %), while for men it is lower (47.5 %). In the next subsection we inspect how the age of a user influences such preferences.|$|R
30|$|By {{analyzing}} Tables 2 and 3, {{it can be}} {{seen that}} our algorithm GATS+HM is the best one which solves the fives instances of Kacem. In fact, the GATS+HM outperforms the AL+CGA in four out of five instances; the Heuristic in three out of five instances; and the LEGA, the MOPSO+LS, BBO, and the Hybrid NSGA-II in two out of five instances. In addition, by solving this first data set, our GATS+HM attains the same results obtained by the chosen approaches such as in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> 1 <b>for</b> LEGA, BBO, Hybrid NSGA-II, and Heuristic; in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> 2 <b>for</b> MOPSO+LS and BBO; in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> 3 <b>for</b> LEGA; in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> 4 <b>for</b> all <b>the</b> algorithms; and in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> 5 <b>for</b> MOPSO+LS and Hybrid NSGA-II.|$|R
5|$|Ethical Oil: <b>The</b> <b>Case</b> <b>for</b> Canada's Oil Sands is a {{book written}} by Canadian lawyer, talk-show host and {{lobbyist}} Ezra Levant, which makes a case for exploiting the Athabasca oil sands and its sister projects in Alberta. Published in 2010 by McClelland & Stewart in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the book became a non-fiction best seller and won the National Business Book Award for 2011.|$|E
5|$|Horner, {{an expert}} on the Hadrosauridae family, had less {{affinity}} for other kinds of dinosaurs. In 1987 and 1989, horned dinosaur specialist Peter Dodson was invited to investigate the new ceratopsian finds. In 1990, the fossil material was seen by Dodson as strengthening <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> the validity of a separate Styracosaurus ovatus, to be distinguished from Styracosaurus albertensis.|$|E

5|$|In captivity studies, it {{has been}} {{discovered}} {{that most of the}} hybrids do not follow Haldane's Rule, but sometimes hybrid females die before they reach sexual maturity, thereby supporting <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> the American black duck being a distinct species.|$|E
5|$|In mathematics, {{constructions of}} {{mathematical}} objects are needed, {{which is also}} <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> stochastic processes, {{to prove that they}} exist mathematically. There are two main approaches for constructing a stochastic process. One approach involves considering a measurable space of functions, defining a suitable measurable mapping from a probability space to this measurable space of functions, and then deriving the corresponding finite-dimensional distributions.|$|E
5|$|Martingales {{can also}} be created from {{stochastic}} processes by applying some suitable transformations, which is <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> the homogeneous Poisson process (on the real line) resulting in a martingale called the compensated Poisson process. Martingales {{can also be}} built from other martingales. For example, there are martingales based on the martingale the Wiener process, forming continuous-time martingales.|$|E

5|$|The {{combination}} of the radius and the mass of a star determines its surface gravity. Giant stars have a much lower surface gravity than do main sequence stars, while the opposite is <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> degenerate, compact stars such as white dwarfs. The surface gravity can influence {{the appearance of a}} star's spectrum, with higher gravity causing a broadening of the absorption lines.|$|E

5|$|The folk {{elements}} in the genre often reflect the ethnic background of the musicians as is <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> the Scandinavian folk music in Finntroll and Korpiklaani, the Baltic folk music in Metsatöll and Skyforger or the Middle Eastern background of Orphaned Land. However, some bands defy the geographical and ethnical background, like Ymyrgar, who hail from Tunisia but chose to focus on Norse mythology.|$|E
5|$|The genre {{has always}} had its {{greatest}} appeal for white males. Most of the musicians involved were male, as was <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> most rock music of the time, Female singers were better represented in the progressive folk bands, who displayed {{a broader range of}} vocal styles than the progressive rock bands with whom they frequently toured and shared band members.|$|E
