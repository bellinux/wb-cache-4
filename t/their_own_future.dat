5|$|Link and the King {{return to}} Hyrule to {{discover}} that Ganon has captured Tetra. Link follows them to Ganon's tower, defeating Ganon's minions before Ganon overcomes him. Ganon joins Link's and Tetra's Triforce pieces with his own Triforce of Power, forming the complete Triforce, which will grant his wish to rule the world. Before he can act, the King of Hyrule appears and makes his own wish that the Goddesses wash Ganon and Hyrule away, and grant Link and Tetra hope for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>future.</b> Link and Tetra battle Ganon with the Master Sword and magical arrows as water pours around them; with the final blow, the Master Sword turns Ganon to stone. Link and Tetra rise to the surface as the King and Hyrule are submerged. They are reunited with their friends; a post-credits scene shows the heroes sailing off {{to find a new}} land.|$|E

25|$|For example, {{in order}} {{to live up to the}} ideal of {{self-determination}} laid out in the Fourteen Points, Germans, whether Austrian or German, should be able to decide <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>future</b> and government. However, the French especially were concerned that an expanded Germany would be a huge security risk. Further complicating the situation, delegations such as the Czechs and Slovenians made strong claims on some German-speaking territories.|$|E
25|$|COAs {{perceptions}} of their parents drinking habits influence <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>future</b> drinking patterns and are developed at an early age. Alcohol related expectancies are correlated with parental alcoholism and alcohol abuse among their offspring. Problem solving discussions in families with an alcoholic parent contained more negative family interactions than in families with non-alcoholics parents. Several factors related to parental alcoholism influence COA substance abuse including stress, negative affect and decreased parental monitoring. Impaired parental monitoring and negative affect correlate with COAs associating with peers that support drug use.|$|E

25|$|A movie by Lizzie Borden, Working Girls {{affected}} how {{the society}} perceives women in different fields and positions, it also features feminism and topics on capitalism. Working Girls {{is an independent}} production published in 1986 about the daily life of upper class prostitutes in a small Manhattan bordello. The main characters in the story have backgrounds such as graduates from Yale university and Law; the movie {{makes it clear that}} they were not forced into the field but chose it themselves. Throughout the film, power dressing was promoted along with the capability of women taking control of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>future.</b>|$|E
25|$|African {{countries}} {{partnering with}} China today are signing with a future world superpower. In Africa, this Chinese alliance provides strong psychological consequences. It provides economic hope and shows African elites {{an example of}} success which they may take as exemplars of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>future.</b> Writer Harry Broadman commented that if Chinese investments in key sectors of infrastructure, telecommunication, manufacturing, foods, and textiles radically alter the African continent, the main change will {{have taken place in}} African minds. With the recent growth and economic improvement, more Africans students are returning to Africa after studies abroad in order to bring their skills and industry home.|$|E
25|$|Today in the {{developed}} world, most blood donors are unpaid volunteers who donate blood for a community supply. In poorer countries, established supplies are limited and donors usually give blood when family or friends need a transfusion (directed donation). Many donors donate {{as an act of}} charity, but in countries that allow paid donation some donors are paid, and in some cases there are incentives other than money such as paid time off from work. Donors can also have blood drawn for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>future</b> use (autologous donation). Donating is relatively safe, but some donors have bruising where the needle is inserted or may feel faint.|$|E

25|$|Aside {{from the}} USA, two other nations became {{involved}} in this war. These were Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and South Africa, {{both of which were}} ruled by the white minority. Their regimes were both concerned about <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>future</b> {{in the case of a}} Portuguese defeat. Rhodesia and South Africa initially limited their participation to shipments of arms and supplies. However, by 1968 the South Africans began providing Alouette III helicopters with crews to the Portuguese Air Force (FAP), and finally several companies of South African Defence Forces (SADF) infantry who were deployed in southern and central Angola. However, contemporary reports about them guarding the iron mines of Cassinga were never confirmed.|$|E
25|$|Criticism of Hrdy's {{hypothesis}} {{emerges from}} evidence {{which suggests that}} male primates can discriminate between their own offspring and the offspring of others. In one study, researchers analysed the DNA of 75 juvenile baboons to conclude who fathered them. They found that males selectively cared for their own offspring, particularly when their offspring became involved in aggressive confrontations which posed the possibility of injuries or {{a threat to their}} social standing. Evidently, if males can discriminate between their own offspring and the offspring of others, then there is no purpose in the female attempting to create paternity confusion during the pregnancy stage. This would be counter-intuitive, as, once the offspring is born, the males will know whether the offspring is, or is not, <b>their</b> <b>own.</b> <b>Future</b> research will need to be conducted in this vein to investigate whether males in other species show the ability to discriminate between their own offspring and the offspring of others before coming to any decisive conclusions.|$|E
25|$|The book {{created a}} {{reaction}} in China, sparking follow-up essays by Chinese writers who were {{taken aback by}} the Phan's description of Vietnamese life under French colonial rule. It generated gloomy pieces by Chinese writers who predicted that their nation would suffer a similar fate if they failed to modernize. One such Chinese response later became a teaching text at the Tonkin Free School in Hanoi, a school run by Phan's contemporaries to promote the independence movement. However, Phan did not receive much of a reaction in terms of aid towards his independence efforts, since the book made Chinese readers worry about <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>future.</b> The book had a much better reception among Vietnamese readers. Phan and a colleague, Đặng Tử Kính, left Japan {{for the first time in}} August 1905, carrying 50 copies of the book that were to distributed throughout Vietnam, of which further copies were made inside the country. Phan's direct writing style, without the use of allegories, upset traditionalists but made the book more accessible to literate people who had not been trained in classical literature.|$|E

25|$|Many factors {{played a}} role in Britain’s {{long-term}} economic growth, such as the industrial revolution in the late 1700s and the prominent presence of child labour during the industrial age. Children who worked at an early age were often not forced; but did so because they needed to help their family survive financially. Due to poor employment opportunities for many parents, sending their children to work on farms and in factories was a way to help feed and support the family. Child Labour first started to occur in England when household businesses were turned into local labour markets that mass-produced the once homemade goods. Because children often helped produce the goods out of their homes, working in a factory to make those same goods was a simple change for many of these youths. Although there are many counts of {{children under the age of}} ten working for factories, the majority of children workers were between the ages of ten and fourteen. This age range was an important time for many youths as they were first helping to provide for their families; while also transitioning to save for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>future</b> families.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the last}} half-century, the {{principle}} guiding federal American Indian policy became self-determination.

[...] Self-determination recognizes reservations as sovereign nations within US boundaries, meaning {{they are able to}} make and enforce <b>their</b> <b>own</b> laws and regulations, are independent from states' laws and regulations, and must abide by most federal laws.|$|R
