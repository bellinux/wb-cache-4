500|$|There are a {{great many}} {{combinations}} of resonators and transducers {{that can be used}} to construct a mechanical filter. A selection of some of these is shown in the diagrams. Figure 6 shows a filter using disc flexural resonators and magnetostrictive transducers. The transducer drives the centre of the first resonator, causing it to vibrate. The edges of the disc move in antiphase to the centre when the driving signal is at, or close to, resonance, and the signal is transmitted through the connecting rods to the next resonator. [...] When the driving signal is not close to resonance, there is little movement at the edges, and the filter rejects (does not pass) the signal. Figure 7 shows a similar idea involving longitudinal resonators connected together in a chain by connecting rods. In this diagram, the filter is driven by piezoelectric transducers. It could equally well have used magnetostrictive transducers. Figure 8 shows a filter using torsional resonators. In this diagram, the input has a torsional piezoelectric transducer and the output has a magnetostrictive transducer. This would be quite unusual in a real design, as both input and output usually have the same type of transducer. The magnetostrictive transducer is only shown here to demonstrate how longitudinal vibrations may be converted to <b>torsional</b> <b>vibrations</b> and vice versa. Figure 9 shows a filter using drumhead mode resonators. The edges of the discs are fixed to the casing of the filter (not shown in the diagram) so the vibration of the disc is in the same modes as the membrane of a drum. Collins calls this type of filter a disc wire filter.|$|E

40|$|As {{large-scale}} {{wind farms}} (WFs) are {{integrated with the}} power grid, {{the interaction between the}} WF and the grid may excite <b>torsional</b> <b>vibration</b> of the shaft of the wind turbine. To study the shaft's <b>torsional</b> <b>vibration</b> characteristics of a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) -based WF, a detailed small-signal model of DFIG is established first. Then the small-signal model for a WF composed of multiple DFIGs is developed {{on the basis of the}} single-machine model. Modal analysis is employed to investigate the <b>torsional</b> <b>vibration</b> characteristics of a WF made up of several identical DFIGs, whose accuracy is also demonstrated through time-domain simulation. To simplify the <b>torsional</b> <b>vibration</b> analysis for the DFIG-based WF, a reduced-order equivalent model is proposed. The results obtained from modal analysis show that the equivalent model not only precisely maintains all the <b>torsional</b> <b>vibration</b> modes of the original small-signal model but also greatly reduces the computation complexity. With the equivalent model, the 'curse of dimensionality' problem is solved in <b>torsional</b> <b>vibration</b> analysis for large WFs, which is of great help in the design of further damping schemes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Circular and {{annular plates}} {{are widely used}} in {{machinery}} as basic components. Their <b>torsional</b> <b>vibration</b> behaviour is studied in this article. An analytical model is developed, and the natural frequencies and mode shapes are calculated for the <b>torsional</b> <b>vibration</b> under different boundary conditions. A physical insight is gained into the <b>torsional</b> <b>vibration</b> behaviour of cir-cular and annular plates. Results show that the <b>torsional</b> <b>vibration</b> behaviour of circular and annular plates is different {{compared with that of}} circular shafts. Torque moment in annular plates is transmitted via ring layers from the inner ring to the outer ring and vice versa. In addition, the <b>torsional</b> <b>vibration</b> magnitude in terms of angular displacement decreases with increase in radius. This {{can be explained by the}} fact that, when vibration energy is transmitted from the inner ring to the outer ring, the circle becomes larger and the energy density becomes lower. It is similar to the situation of a spherical wave propagation from its source. The analytical results are verified using an FEA model. Good agreement is shown between the analytical and FEA models...|$|R
