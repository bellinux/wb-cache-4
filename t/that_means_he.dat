[...] Underwood and Claire [...] "continue their ruthless rise to power as threats mount on all fronts." ...|$|E
2500|$|In another interpretation, Iblis' pride creates {{remoteness}} and separation. So, Iblis {{became the}} instrument of divine anger, and supported the Nafs, which lead man astray from [...] divinity. Rumi describes Iblis as being blind in one eye. <b>That</b> <b>means,</b> <b>he</b> saw in Adam just the clay, but was blind to his spirit, so his sin derived from spiritual blindness and inability to see the meaning behind form, caused by pride.|$|E

2500|$|Muslim {{leaders have}} criticised the current Grand Mufti of Australia, {{following}} the Muftis {{response to the}} November 2015 Paris attacks. Ameer Ali has said, [...] "The problem I have with the Mufti is he cannot communicate in English. <b>That</b> <b>means</b> <b>he</b> has {{to rely on the}} people around him."

2500|$|As for {{individual}} identities during these radical changes, Kurzweil suggests {{people think of}} themselves as an evolving pattern rather than a specific collection of molecules. Kurzweil says evolution moves towards [...] "greater complexity, greater elegance, greater knowledge, greater intelligence, greater beauty, greater creativity, and greater levels of subtle attributes such as love". He says that these attributes, in the limit, are generally used to describe God. <b>That</b> <b>means,</b> <b>he</b> continues, that evolution is moving towards a conception of God and that the transition away from biological roots is in fact a spiritual undertaking.|$|E
25|$|With Lou Harrison...being gay is {{something}} affirmative. He's {{proud to be}} a gay composer and interested in talking about what <b>that</b> might <b>mean.</b> <b>He</b> doesn't feel threatened <b>that</b> this <b>means</b> <b>he</b> won't be thought of as an American composer who is also great and timeless and universal.|$|R

2500|$|There {{was much}} {{controversy}} to Dan being revealed as Gossip Girl {{in the season}} finale. Dan had always struggled to be an insider among the Upper East Side and had supposedly created Gossip Girl to gain more power and {{had been the one}} “pulling the strings the whole time” as mentioned by Serena in the finale. However, there was much speculation and controversy regarding this decision. Penn Badgley who played Dan, stated {{in an interview that he}} himself found it funny that they had decided to make him be Gossip Girl as there were too many loopholes in the show for this to make sense. There were times during the show where he would be alone and read a Gossip Girl post and be completely blown away by it. In the interview he stated, “All those times that he was alone, that was him acting. So <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>he</b> was completely schizophrenic and transgender." ...|$|E

60|$|Old man Ellison {{was his own}} vaciero. <b>That</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{supplied}} his sheep camps with wood, water, and rations by his own labours {{instead of}} hiring a vaciero. On small ranches it is often done.|$|R
50|$|Loyal to Kera's family, Menu was a super {{computer}} {{designed to}} make their lives easier, and while in most science fiction <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>he's</b> going to turn evil, Menu is quite the opposite.

50|$|During {{his term}} as Lutheran bishop, Jacobson ordained many women as ministers but <b>he</b> said <b>that</b> doesn't <b>mean</b> <b>he</b> endorses {{it for the}} Roman Catholic Church.|$|R
6000|$|... "I presume <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>he</b> went to Victoria for {{the extra}} stores this morning; but {{how did he get}} there? It must be some distance, from what I know of the coast, and he would have a {{head-wind}} all the way back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, he repented, you know. <b>That</b> <b>means</b> <b>he</b> had faith, and if {{you have}} faith you are saved. It doesna matter how bad you have been. You have just to say 'I believe' before you die, and God lets you in. It's so easy, Grizel," [...] cried Elspeth, with shining eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very true, Pathfinder, very true," [...] {{answered}} Muir, who was lingering near Mabel, though {{ashamed to}} address her {{particularly in the}} presence of the officers' wives.

5000|$|This {{actually}} worries me. If someone spat at you, <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{is angry}} at you. If you wipe off the spit, this shows resistance, {{and will make}} him angrier. Remember: do not wipe off the spit. It will dry itself. You should smile and let him spit at you.|$|R

And {{that they}} might not be left in the dark, but {{perfectly}} know what ministration it is <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>means,</b> <b>he</b> saith expressly, it is that 'written and engraven in stones.'

2500|$|Author Greg Long {{uncovered}} circumstantial evidence, {{of varying}} strength, of footprint hoaxing, {{and possibly even}} sighting and photo hoaxing, in the Yakima vicinity by Patterson. Long argues <b>that</b> this <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> faked the film, too.|$|R
5000|$|Revelation: In , John the Beloved {{states that}} he was [...] "in Spirit" [...] in the [...] "Lord's Day", a term {{apparently}} familiar to his readers, without mentioning Sabbath. First-day Sabbatarians hold <b>that</b> this <b>means</b> <b>he</b> was worshipping on Sunday, the day of Christ's resurrection (cf. , , later patristic writings). Seventh-day Sabbatarians hold <b>that</b> this <b>means</b> <b>he</b> was brought by the Spirit into {{a vision of the}} Day of the Lord (cf. , etc.). Both lay claim to the name [...] "Lord's Day" [...] for Sabbath. In , the millennial reign of Christ is described, which is often interpreted as a seventh (Sabbatical) millennium.|$|R

60|$|When {{the meal}} was over at last and he marched away {{in the midst of}} his bright pageant, with the happy noises in his ears of blaring bugles, rolling drums, and thundering acclamations, he felt that if he had seen the worst of dining in public it was an ordeal which he would be glad to endure several times a day if by <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>he</b> could but buy himself free from some of the more {{formidable}} requirements of his royal office.|$|E

50|$|They {{differed}} as {{to which}} view is correct. Al-Khattaabi said: The correct version is fa aslamu I am safe. Al-Qaadi Iyaad thought that fa aslama he became Muslim was correct, {{and this is the}} preferred version, because he then said, “so he only tells me to do that which is good.” (Reported by Muslim, 2814). And they differed concerning the report that says fa aslama. It was said <b>that</b> it <b>means</b> <b>he</b> submitted in the sense of surrendering, and it appears in this form (fa astaslama - so he surrendered) in reports narrated elsewhere than in Saheeh Muslim. And it was said <b>that</b> it <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> become a Muslim and a believer. This is the apparent meaning.|$|R
5000|$|Overall, Kazuki is a {{good person}} and helps others by using his magic, even when <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{runs the risk of}} turning into ash. His selflessness and {{kindness}} eventually wins over the hearts of Rin and Kuriko. He is at times indecisive and not very courageous, but he prevalently shows his honest nature and his sense of doing the right thing.|$|R
