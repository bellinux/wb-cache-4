5|$|Based on an {{observed}} excess {{emission of}} infrared radiation, Vega {{appears to have}} a circumstellar disk of dust. This dust is likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of collisions between objects in an orbiting debris disk, which is analogous to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System. Stars which display an infrared excess due to dust emission are termed Vega-like stars.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{this shift}} in thought about the {{underlying}} mechanisms in plantar fasciitis, many in the academic community have stated the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis. The structural breakdown of the plantar fascia is believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of repetitive microtrauma (small tears). Microscopic examination of the plantar fascia often shows myxomatous degeneration, connective tissue calcium deposits, and disorganized collagen fibers.|$|E

5|$|The molars are low-crowned (brachydont), with {{relatively}} rounded (bunodont) cusps running lengthwise (selenodont), {{resulting in a}} condition known as bunoselenodonty. The upper molars also lack a distinctive cusp (hypocone). Gheerbrant et al. noted these features and some others are shared with the pantodonts Haplolambda and Leptolambda, but due to many differences between the two, including number of teeth, the similarities are thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of convergent evolution.|$|E

5|$|Château Gaillard {{consists}} of three baileys—an inner, a middle, and an outer with the main entrance to the castle—and a keep, also called a donjon, in the inner-bailey. The baileys, which were separated by rock-cut ditches, housed the castle's stables, workshops, and storage facilities. It is common for extant castles <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of several phases of construction, and were adapted and added to over the period of their use; however Château Gaillard essentially {{is the result of}} one period of building. The division into three wards bears similarities with the design of Château de Chinon, built by HenryII in the mid-12thcentury on a promontory overlooking a town.|$|E

5|$|French typefounders of the 16th century assiduously {{examined}} Manutius's work (and, it is thought, De Aetna in particular) as {{a source}} of inspiration. This examination extended to in some cases copying his first 'M' shown in De Aetna which had no serif pointing out of the letter at top right, a design considered very eccentric. (It has been suggested <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of defective casting, especially since Manutius' later fonts do not show it.) The Griffo font was only cut in a single size, so French punchcutters made modified versions of the design to suit different sizes, with a more delicate structure at larger sizes.|$|E
5|$|In a {{paper by}} Carlos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos {{evidence}} is shown {{for a possible}} bimodal distribution of the distances to the ascending nodes of the ETNOs.

5|$|Killer whales {{have also}} been {{observed}} preying on terrestrial mammals, such as deer swimming between islands off the northwest coast of North America. Killer whale cannibalism has also been reported based on analysis of stomach contents, but this is likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of scavenging remains dumped by whalers. One killer whale was also attacked by its companions after being shot. Although resident killer whales have never been observed to eat other marine mammals, they occasionally harass and kill porpoises and seals for no apparent reason.|$|E

5|$|Low {{back pain}} {{is not a}} {{specific}} disease but rather a complaint that {{may be caused by}} a large number of underlying problems of varying levels of seriousness. The majority of LBP does not have a clear cause but is believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of non-serious muscle or skeletal issues such as sprains or strains. Obesity, smoking, weight gain during pregnancy, stress, poor physical condition, poor posture and poor sleeping position may also contribute to low back pain. A full list of possible causes includes many less common conditions. Physical causes may include osteoarthritis, degeneration of the discs between the vertebrae or a spinal disc herniation, broken vertebra(e) (such as from osteoporosis) or, rarely, an infection or tumor of the spine.|$|E
5|$|Muscle biopsy can {{be useful}} if an episode of {{rhabdomyolysis}} is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of an underlying muscle disorder. A biopsy sample taken during an episode is often uninformative, as it will show only evidence of cell death or may appear normal. Taking the sample is therefore delayed for several weeks or months. The histopathological appearance on the biopsy indicates {{the nature of the}} underlying disorder. For instance, mitochondrial diseases are characterized by ragged red fibers. Biopsy sites may be identified by medical imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging, as the muscles may not be uniformly affected.|$|E
5|$|Population {{studies from}} {{numerous}} {{areas in the}} world have shown that HHT occurs at roughly the same rate in almost all populations: somewhere around 1 in 5000. In some areas, it is much more common; for instance, in the French region of Haut Jura the rate is 1:2351 - twice as common as in other populations. This has been attributed to a founder effect, in which a population descending from a small number of ancestors has a high rate of a particular genetic trait because one of these ancestors harbored this trait. In Haut Jura, this has been shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of a particular ACVRL1 mutation (named c.1112dupG or c.1112_1113insG). The highest rate of HHT is 1:1331, reported in Bonaire and Curaçao, two islands in the Caribbean belonging to the Netherlands Antilles.|$|E

25|$|The {{physical}} {{composition of}} asteroids is varied {{and in most}} cases poorly understood. Ceres appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> composed of a rocky core covered by an icy mantle, where Vesta <b>is</b> thought <b>to</b> have a nickel-iron core, olivine mantle, and basaltic crust. 10 Hygiea, however, which appears to have a uniformly primitive composition of carbonaceous chondrite, <b>is</b> thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> largest undifferentiated asteroid. Most of <b>the</b> smaller asteroids <b>are</b> thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> piles of rubble held together loosely by gravity, though <b>the</b> largest <b>are</b> probably solid. Some asteroids have moons or are co-orbiting binaries: Rubble piles, moons, binaries, and scattered asteroid families <b>are</b> thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of collisions that disrupted a parent asteroid.|$|R
5|$|Sephiroth is {{revealed}} in Final Fantasy VII <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of an experiment by the megacorporation Shinra, in which they injected him with cells from the extraterrestrial lifeform Jenova {{when he was still}} a fetus. Upon discovering this, Sephiroth decides to follow what he believes to be his destiny and take control of the Planet, whilst Cloud and the game's other protagonists attempt to stop him. Sephiroth's role in the story, as well as his background, are expanded in the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII. Additionally, he appears as a boss character in the Kingdom Hearts series, and other video games developed by Square. Sephiroth has been well-received within the video game community, and is highly ranked on many lists of the best video game villains and Final Fantasy characters.|$|E
5|$|The Edwardian {{sites have}} strong {{architectural}} links to castles and town walls {{built in the}} kingdom of Savoy in North Italy during the same period. The resemblance between the two sets of buildings was first noted by historian Arnold Taylor in the 1950s. Similarities include the semi-circular door arches, window styles, corbelled towers, the positioning of putlog holes, tall circular towers and crenellations with pinnacles found in Edward's works in North Wales; in Savoy these can be seen in constructions such as the defences of Saillon, La Bâtiaz and Chillon Castles. Many of these similarities have been considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of the influence of the Savoy architect Master James of St George, employed by Edward I, and who brought other Savoyard architects with him to North Wales.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way covers {{much of the}} constellation's area. Of the {{deep-sky objects}} in Apus, there are two {{prominent}} globular clusters—NGC 6101 and IC 4499—and a large faint nebula that covers several degrees east of Beta and Gamma Apodis. NGC 6101 is a globular cluster of apparent magnitude 9.2 located around 50,000 light-years distant from Earth, which is around 160 light-years across. Around 13 billion years old, it contains {{a high concentration of}} massive bright stars known as blue stragglers, thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of two stars merging. IC 4499 is a loose globular cluster in the medium-far galactic halo; its apparent magnitude is 10.6.|$|E

5|$|The {{brightest}} {{star in the}} constellation is Alpha Telescopii, a blue-white subgiant with an apparent magnitude of 3.5, followed by the orange giant star Zeta Telescopii at magnitude 4.1. Eta and PZ Telescopii are two young star systems with debris disks and brown dwarf companions. Telescopium hosts two unusual stars with very little hydrogen that are likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of two merged white dwarfs: PV Telescopii, also known as HD 168476, is a hot blue extreme helium star, while RS Telescopii is an R Coronae Borealis variable. RR Telescopii is a cataclysmic variable that brightened as a nova to magnitude 6 in 1948.|$|E
5|$|The four giant {{planets are}} also orbited by {{planetary}} rings of varying size and complexity. The rings are composed primarily of dust or particulate matter, but can host tiny 'moonlets' whose gravity shapes and maintains their structure.
