The nearly-stress-free Nb 3 Sn {{lattice parameter}} has been determined using extracted filaments, and the elastic strain in the axial and <b>transverse</b> <b>wire</b> directions in the different wire phases has been calculated. The mechanical properties of the PIT and RRP wire are mainly determined by the properties of Nb 3 Sn and unreacted Nb. This {{is in contrast to}} the bronze route wire, where the matrix can carry substantial loads. In straight wires the axial Nb 3 Sn pre-strain is strongest in the bronze route wire, its value being smaller in the PIT and RRP wires. A strong reduction of the non-Cu elastic modulus of about 30 % is observed during cool-down from ambient temperature to 4. 2 K. The Nb 3 Sn Poisson ratio at 4. 2 K measured in the untwisted bronze route wire is 0. 35. The present study also shows that the process route has a strong influence on the Nb 3 Sn texture...|$|E
40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{consider the}} substrate-induced Majorana localization length renormalization in nanowires {{in contact with}} a bulk superconductor in the strong tunnel-coupled regime, showing explicitly that this renormalization depends strongly on the transverse size of the one-dimensional nanowires. For metallic (e. g. Fe on Pb) or semiconducting (e. g. InSb on Nb) nanowires, the renormalization effect {{is found to be}} very strong and weak respectively because the transverse confinement size in the two situations happens to be 0. 5 nm (metallic nanowire) and 20 nm (semiconducting nanowire). Thus, the Majorana localization length could be very short (long) for metallic (semiconducting) nanowires even for the same values of all other parameters (except for the <b>transverse</b> <b>wire</b> size). We also show that any tunneling conductance measurements in such nanowires, carried out at temperatures and/or energy resolutions comparable to the induced superconducting energy gap, cannot distinguish between the existence of the Majorana modes or ordinary subgap fermionic states since both produce very similar broad and weak peaks in the subgap tunneling conductance independent of the localization length involved. Only low temperature (and high resolution) tunneling measurements manifesting sharp zero bias peaks can be considered to be signatures of Majorana modes in topological nanowires.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{stiffness}} characteristics of Taylor Spatial Frame (TSF) fixed with <b>transverse</b> <b>wires</b> and half pins. Design & Methods: Experiments were carried out at the biomechanics laboratory at Cardiff University. All mechanical testing was performed with a servo hydraulic test frame (MTS 858 Mini Bionix II(R), MTS Corp., Mineapolis, USA). Custom built mounts were used to attach the bone rigidly to the one end of machine and the TSF ring to the other.

40|$|Abstract Background Electrical {{stimulation}} of the central and peripheral nervous systems is a common tool {{that is used to}} improve functional recovery after neuronal injury. Methods Here we described a new configuration of electrical stimulation as it was tested in anesthetized control and spinal cord injury (SCI) mice. Constant voltage output was delivered through two electrodes. While the negative voltage output (ranging from - 1. 8 to - 2. 6 V) was delivered to the muscle via <b>transverse</b> <b>wire</b> electrodes (diameter, 500 μm) located at opposite ends of the muscle, the positive output (ranging from + 2. 4 to + 3. 2 V) was delivered to the primary motor cortex (M 1) (electrode tip, 100 μm). The configuration was named dipolar cortico-muscular stimulation (dCMS) and consisted of 100 pulses (1 ms pulse duration, 1 Hz frequency). Results In SCI animals, after dCMS, cortically-elicited muscle contraction improved markedly at the contralateral (456 %) and ipsilateral (457 %) gastrocnemius muscles. The improvement persisted {{for the duration of the}} experiment (60 min). The enhancement of cortically-elicited muscle contraction was accompanied by the reduction of M 1 maximal threshold and the potentiation of spinal motoneuronal evoked responses at the contralateral (313 %) and ipsilateral (292 %) sides of the spinal cord. Moreover, spontaneous activity recorded from single spinal motoneurons was substantially increased contralaterally (121 %) and ipsilaterally (54 %). Interestingly, spinal motoneuronal responses and muscle twitches evoked by the test {{stimulation of}} non-treated M 1 (received no dCMS) were significantly enhanced as well. Similar results obtained from normal animals albeit the changes were relatively smaller. Conclusion These findings demonstrated that dCMS could improve functionality of corticomotoneuronal pathway and thus it may have therapeutic potential. </p...|$|E
40|$|This report {{introduces}} {{an approach}} to characterizing thermal and mechanical properties of viscous liquids, by using a specific set up utilizing the coupling of a piezoelectric bulk modulus gauge (PBG) and a thermistor placed on a <b>transverse</b> <b>wire</b> through the PBG. More specifically we are using this set-up to investigate the temperature response to a pressure change of a supercooled liquid at the dynamic glass transition, as is also stated in the title. Physically this is achieved by applying a voltage on the liquid filled PBG, causing a volume displacement, which then in turn creates a pressure difference in the sphere. The report includes an introduction to supercooled liquids, viscosity and the glass transition. An introduction is also given to the energy bond formalism we use to derive {{a model for the}} experimental system (expressed in circuit diagrams). Based on this we derive transfer matrices that characterize the energy couplings of the thermodynamic, mechanical and electrical variables. Experiments are conducted with an empty PBG, a liquid-filled PBG and the latter utilizing the special conditions from the set-up with the thermistor and PBG coupling. From these experiments coupled with some approximations and generalized modelling, we are able to characterize various properties like capacitance and adiabatic compressibility. This data is used in conjunction with data determined in previous research to characterize the inverse of the adiabatic pressure coefficient. A significant amount of noise is detected in some experimental data. Also some unexpected development was detected in the frequency dependence of temperature change (δT) and the inverse adiabatic pressure coefficient (1 / βS). However - concurrent independent experiments that use the same equipment but in a different manner show similar abnormalities in the data. This is indicating some ”exo-model” influence that we have not accounted for. In spite of various abnormalities, the model is deemed viable for continued development, due to consistency with other similar studies and results...|$|E
40|$|The {{ballistic}} conductance of a coupled T-shaped semiconductor {{quantum wire}} (CTQW) are studied. Two types of CTQW are considered, {{one of which}} is a Π -shaped quantum wire (Π QW) which consists of two <b>transverse</b> <b>wires</b> {{on the same side of}} the main wire and the other a Π -clone quantum wire (Π CQW) which consists of two <b>transverse</b> <b>wires</b> on the opposite sides of the main wire.

Most of transmission profiles of Π QW and Π CQW are found to be distinguishable for large separation d between the two transverse arms. The transmission probability manifests oscillatory behavior when d is increased. When a potential is added to the connection region, it results in decoupling or coupling effects between the two T-shaped wires according to whether it is positive or negative.

30|$|A {{transverse}} concave proximal incision is {{made over}} the distal femur and proximal fibula. The fibula, patella and distal femur are exposed. Three lines outlining two visor flaps (like the visor on a motor cycle helmet) are marked. At the medial and lateral ends, the pedicle for each visor is kept as wide as possible. The proximal visor flap contains the patella. The distal visor flap is all capsular. In the Paley modification, the quadriceps muscle remains attached to the superior pole of the patella and no Z lengthening is done to the quadriceps tendon. This allows a new patella to form anterior to the femur. The proximal two visor incisions are made. The most inferior one is made after first detaching the biceps tendon laterally and the semitendinosis tendon medially. The medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle is identified. Dissection is carried out along the lateral border of this muscle to identify and protect the popliteal vessels. Once the vessels are protected, the inferior visor capsular incision is made. The perichondrium on the anterior surface of the patella is incised like the capital letter H, creating two flaps of perichondrium. The superior visor flap is brought under the inferior one to move it distally. If the patella is unossified, it is drilled in a T-shaped fashion to insert BMP 2. Bone wax is used to seal the anterior and posterior aspect of the drill hole in the patella after the BMP 2 is inserted {{in order to prevent}} leakage. The proximal fibular wires are exposed. The distal fibular wires are then exposed through a transverse incision {{at the tip of the}} distal fibular epiphysis. The dome of the talus and the distal fibula are exposed with the wires in place. The wires from the fibula are unbent and removed. New wires are immediately inserted. It is important to keep intramedullary wires in the fibula to prevent inadvertent fracture of the now osteoporotic fibula. The wires are retracted distally and the proximal epiphysis is cut across with a knife and then retracted proximally so that the distal epiphysis can be cut across. The fibular epiphyseal cuts expose the ossific nuclei of the proximal and distal fibula. The talus is cut across parallel to the sole of the foot exposing the talar ossific nucleus. The two wires are withdrawn proximally to align the distal epiphysis of the fibula with the ossific nucleus of the talus. The wires are then drilled antegrade through the talus and out the plantar aspect of the foot with the foot held 90 ° to the fibula. These wires are then withdrawn into the fibula. The upper end of the fibula can be slightly drilled to allow for insertion of the BMP 2 with the patella apposed to the fibula anterior drill hole in the patella opposed to the hole in the fibular epiphysis. The two wires exiting the foot are now advanced in a retrograde fashion through the patella, and the wires protruding on the patellar articular surface are bent 180 ° into a hook. The hook is advanced into the substance of the patella to pull the patella down to the fibula. These two wires need to be pulled below the articular surface to prevent their protrusion into the knee joint. The medial and lateral perichondral flaps are sutured to the side of the fibula. The visor flaps can now be sewn across to each other. At the junction of the quadriceps muscle the remnant of the patella and the muscle are sutured to the inferior visor flap, that was flipped upwards. The remnant of the patella is also sutured to this capsular flap. The inferior aspect of this capsular flap is sutured to the superior edge of the patella in its new position. The inferior aspect of the patella, which is now posterior, is sutured to the posterior capsule. The biceps and semitendinosis tendons are sutured to the lateral and medial aspects of the fibula respectively. The skin is closed in layers over a drain. The wires in the foot can be reinserted. The distal ring is fixed and tensioned to these three wires. The proximal and distal rings are connected with struts. A <b>transverse</b> <b>wire</b> is drilled into the distal fibula and then arced and tensioned to the foot ring, which compresses the ankle fusion site. The two hook wires exiting the plantar aspect of the foot are secured to the foot ring under slight tension.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2016 Modernization and {{industrialization}} have {{paved the}} way for the construction industry of India to expand. On the other hand the Indian construction industry is set to face an acute workforce shortage. The shortage of construction workers has in fact slowed down the growth of this industry in major cities across the country and escalated its cost by 40 percent. An alternative way to replace the labor force is by automation techniques. This study is a numerical analysis to evaluate structural behavior of simply supported concrete beams reinforced with welded wires in comparison with mild steel reinforced concrete beams. Welding conventional steel bars (60 ksi) reduces their shear strength by 50 percent. Welded Wire Reinforcement (80 ksi), with its greater strength, higher durability, significantly lower placing and overall cost, provides an alternative and perhaps a better substitution for mild steel bars. The commercial finite element analysis program, ABAQUS, was used to model the non-linear behavior of reinforced concrete beams.

Six <b>transverse</b> arrestor <b>wires</b> were installed on the flight deck and were later modernized in 1936 to stop a 6000 kg aircraft. The ship's hangars were both 102.4 m long and 18.9 m wide, and had an approximate area of [...] Between them, they gave the ship the capacity to store 48 aircraft, although only 37 could be operated at one time. After the Fourth Fleet Incident, Ryūjōs bridge and {{the leading edge of the}} flight deck were rounded off to make them more streamlined. This reduced the length of the flight deck by 2 m.|$|R
40|$|Micromagnetic {{modeling}} {{shows that}} the placement of non-magnetic conductive pads on a ferromagnetic wire affects the current-induced velocity of a domain wall (DW) in the wire and {{can act as a}} DW chirality filter. The pads shunt the current, causing a non-uniform spin current distribution inside the ferromagnetic wire and an Oersted field <b>transverse</b> to the <b>wire.</b> This suppresses Walker breakdown allowing higher current densities to be imposed before breakdown occurs. The transverse Oersted field pins the DW under some regimes of current density and pad geometry, selectively allowing transmission of DWs of only one chirality.

40|$|The {{longitudinal}} and {{transverse beam}} coupling impedance {{of the first}} final TOTEM Roman Pot unit has been measured in the laboratory with the wire method. For the evaluation of <b>transverse</b> impedance the <b>wire</b> position has been kept constant, and the insertions of the RP were moved asymmetrically. With the original configuration of the RP, resonances with fairly high Q values were observed. In order to mitigate this problem, RF-absorbing ferrite plates were mounted in appropriate locations. As a result, all resonances were sufficiently damped to meet the stringent LHC beam coupling impedance requirements.

Hiryū {{was one of}} only two carriers ever built whose island was on the port side of the ship ( [...] was the other). It was also positioned further to the rear and encroached on the width of the flight deck, unlike Sōryū. Nine <b>transverse</b> arrestor <b>wires</b> were installed on the flight deck that could stop a [...] aircraft. One group of three wires was positioned further forward to allow the ship to land aircraft over the bow, although this was never done in practice.

The upper hangar was [...] and had an approximate height of the lower was [...] and had an approximate height of [...] Together they had an approximate total area of [...] This caused problems in handling aircraft because the wings of a Nakajima B5N [...] "Kate" [...] torpedo bomber could neither be spread nor folded in the upper hangar.|$|R
500|$|The carriers' [...] {{flight deck}} had a maximum width of 29meters and {{overhung}} the superstructure at both ends, supported by pillars. Ten <b>transverse</b> arrestor <b>wires</b> were {{installed on the}} flight deck that could stop a [...] aircraft. If the aircraft missed those, it could be stopped by one of three crash barricades. Although space and weight were allocated for two aircraft catapults, their development was not completed before the Shōkaku-class ships were sunk. The ships were designed with two superimposed hangars; the upper hangar was about [...] long and had a width that varied between [...] It had a height of [...] while the lower hangar was [...] high and only usable by fighters. The lower hangar was about [...] shorter than the upper one and its width ranged from [...] Together they had a total area of [...] Each hangar could be subdivided by five or six fire curtains and they were fitted with fire fighting foam dispensers on each side.

40|$|Under a {{magnetic}} field along its axis, domain wall motion in a uniaxial nanowire is much slower than in the fully anisotropic case, typically by several orders of magnitude (the square of the dimensionless Gilbert damping parameter). However, {{with the addition of}} {{a magnetic}} field <b>transverse</b> to the <b>wire,</b> this behaviour is dramatically reversed; up to a critical field strength, analogous to the Walker breakdown field, domain walls in a uniaxial wire propagate faster than in a fully anisotropic <b>wire</b> (without <b>transverse</b> field). Beyond this critical field strength, precessional motion sets in, and the mean velocity decreases. Our results are based on leading-order analytic calculations of the velocity and critical field as well as numerical solutions of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation.
