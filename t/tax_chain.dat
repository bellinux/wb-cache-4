However, the type of polyubiquitin chain linkages and the host factors that are required for Tax ubiquitination have not been identified.

Furthermore, the ubiquitination of Tax is critically dependent on the E 2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc 13.

It predicts that the informality of a firm is correlated to the informality of firms from which it buys or sells. The model also implies that higher tolerance for informal firms in one production stage increases tax avoidance in downstream and upstream stages. Empirical analysis shows that, in fact, various measures of formality of suppliers and purchasers (and its enforcement) are correlated with the formality of a firm. Even more interestingly, when we look at sectors where Brazilian firms are not subject to the credit system of value added tax, but instead the value added tax is applied at some stage of production at a rate that is estimated by the <b>tax</b> authorities, this <b>chain</b> effect vanishes.

Here, we analyzed a panel of HLA-A 2 –Tax 11 - 19 reactive T cell clones to examine how small allelic variations of MHC molecules could alter the functional outcome of antigen recognition. Similar to the effects induced by antigenic altered peptide ligands, weak or partial agonistic T cell functions were identified in individual T cell clones with the recognition of MHC-altered peptide ligands (MAPLs). Interestingly, one subtype of HLA-A 2 molecules induced an unusual type of partial agonistic function; proliferation without cytotoxicity.

Reciprocal mutations of the <b>Tax</b> peptide side <b>chain</b> engaging the D-pocket indeed restored the agonist functions of the MHC–peptide complex.

30|$|In {{order to}} be {{prepared}} for future environmental regulations and to improve market competitiveness, companies are realizing that they have to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a supply chain perspective. Supply chain GHG emissions account for around 75  % of the whole GHG emissions from an industry sector, while companies’ direct GHG emissions average only 14  % of their supply chain GHG emissions prior to use and disposal across all industries [1]. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) [2] released one report certifying that managing supply chain GHG emissions can effectively avoid exposure to lack of preparedness for complying with carbon regulations. In fact, numerous firms from the electronic industry (i.e., HP and DELL) and retail industry (i.e., Walmart) have already devoted themselves to voluntary supply chain GHG emissions reduction programs. Although there is so far no policy targeted on supply chain GHG emissions reduction, researchers have recognized that companies in pursuit of green supply chain strategies could leverage the opportunities offered by market-based instruments such as emission trading.

40|$|Calls {{to abolish}} or modify payroll tax are often heard. For example, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry {{has called for}} the {{abolition}} of payroll tax as part of wider tax reform. While several reasons are cited for abolishing or modifying payroll tax, a common reason is that payroll tax reduces employment. It is important {{to distinguish between the}} legal incidence of a tax and its economic incidence. Legal incidence refers to the party legally responsible for paying the tax. In the case of payroll tax, legal incidence falls on the employer. The cost to the employer is, however, reduced by the fact that payroll tax is a deduction for company tax assessment purposes. Economic incidence refers to who finally bears the tax. As with other taxes—such as excise on alcohol—the economic incidence of payroll tax can shift along the production and distribution <b>chain.</b> <b>Tax</b> shifting occurs if the price of what is taxed increases when the tax is imposed. When tax shifting occurs, lower employment is only one of several possible effects of payroll tax. In general, the payroll tax base [...] that is, the items to which the tax applies [...] includes wages and salaries and other forms of employee benefit such as bonuses and fringe benefits.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this review is to illustrate the properties, engine performance, and emission characteristics of biodiesel–diesel blends employed in CI engines under different conditions worldwide {{as well as the}} environmental and economic impacts of biodiesel production, and the effects of this blend on engine durability are also discussed. Biodiesels are gaining more importance as a promising alternative energy resource due to the global fossil fuel crisis and emission problems. However, it was realized that extensive utilization of biodiesel would <b>tax</b> the food <b>chain</b> and could lead to food shortages. Thus, the use of a blend of biodiesel with conventional fuel was suggested to balance its usage, which could still provide a beneficial greenhouse effect. From the results of the investigation, it is reported that blends containing up to 30 % biodiesel have almost the same properties as diesel. Most investigation results have shown that, compared to diesel, biodiesel–diesel blend provides shorter ignition delay and a reduced heat release rate as well as a slightly higher efficiency by sacrificing a small amount of fuel. The HC, CO, and PM emissions are reduced to a great extent but the NOx emission becomes slightly higher. Biodiesels are expected to reduce the dependence on imported petroleum with the associated economic vulnerability, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants, and revitalize the economy by increasing demand and prices for agricultural products.

Still, {{results on the}} effectiveness of these laws remain tentative. In this paper, we test empirically whether fiscal performance, measured as the level of primary fiscal balances and their volatility, indeed improved after the implementation of Fiscal Responsibility Laws in a sample of Latin American and advanced economies. We show that traditional econometric approaches, which rely on the use of dummies in time series or panel regressions, yield biased estimates. In contrast, our empirical strategy recognizes that, a priori, the timing of the effect of these laws on fiscal performance is unknown, while controlling for the impact of the business and commodity cycles on fiscal outcomes. Overall, we find limited empirical evidence in support of the view that Fiscal Responsibility Laws have had a distinguishable effect on fiscal performance. However, Fiscal Responsibility Laws could still have other positive effects on the conduct of fiscal policy not analyzed here, for instance, through enhanced transparency and guidance in the budget process and lower risk premia.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes ways {{in which}} Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) shift profits {{from one country to}} another to reduce their income tax expense. This is an important topic for a number of reasons. From a country’s perspective, its income tax rates and policies can have a significant impact upon its tax revenue, economic competitiveness, and the vibrancy of its economy. From the MNE’s perspective, income tax rates and policies determine a firm’s tax obligations, and thus affect net income and enterprise value. The dissertation examines several {{ways in which}} MNEs shift profits to reduce income taxes, and consists of five chapters. The introductory chapter reviews the economic evidence demonstrating firms shift profits from one country to another in response to tax rates. In the past two decades a number of economic studies have shown firms use tax and accounting techniques to shift reported profits to low tax jurisdictions, and that chapter reviews key articles that have demonstrated this. The second paper explains how MNEs finance international investments to shift interest income to low-tax jurisdictions. It reviews government tax policies in a number of countries that have been enacted to limit interest income shifting, and recommends an approach to control this activity. The third paper examines <b>tax</b> efficient supply <b>chains,</b> in which <b>tax</b> departments and supply chain organizations collaborate to site business operations to achieve supply chain objectives and reduce tax obligations. The fourth chapter analyzes how some U. S. -headquartered firms have moved their corporate headquarters from the U. S. to tax havens, to reduce their tax expense and avoid U. S. international tax policies. The fifth and final chapter examines new U. S. tax regulations that propose to value intellectual property transfers in the same way outside investors would, which the U. S.
