At the intersection with Main Street in the northern end of the village, the route turns northeast while former Highway649 continues north.|$|E
5|$|At the hotel, James locates a {{videotape}} which depicts him killing his dying wife. At {{this point in}} the game, the letter from Mary is shown to have been a blank piece of paper the entire time. In another room, a final meeting with Angela sees her giving up on life as she is unable to cope with her trauma and guilt any longer. She walks into a fire and is not seen again. At <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>it</b> is revealed that in Angela's version of Silent Hill the town is always on fire.|$|E

The battery is an 840mAh internal rechargeable, compared to 1000mAh for the DS Lite, and has an optimal lifespan of approximately 500 cycles; after <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>it</b> may {{be replaced by the}} user.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century, Stokesay Castle {{continued}} to be leased by the Baldwyn family, although they sublet the property {{to a range of}} tenants; after <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>it</b> ceased {{to be used as a}} domestic dwelling. Two wood and plaster buildings, built against the side of the hall, were demolished around 1800, and by the early 19th century the castle was being used for storing grain and manufacturing, including barrel-making, coining and a smithy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, Keyser Creek {{was a clear}} stream until it reached the repair shops of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. At <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>it</b> {{received}} some oil and refuse. At the Capouse Shaft, the creek washed an ash bank and a culm bank and was contaminated with some sulfur. More dirty waste materials drained into the creek at the Archbald Colliery and a fertilizer plant also discharged waste into it.|$|E

5|$|M-84 {{begins at}} M-58 in a {{residential}} area {{on the west side}} of Saginaw heading due north on Bay Street. At <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>it</b> is five lanes, with two lanes in each direction and a center turn lane. The highway enters Saginaw Township as Bay Road and serves as a major artery in the area, passing the Fashion Square Mall and several other shopping centers and major retail stores near Tittabawassee Road. The main entrance to Saginaw Valley State University is located on M-84 at Pierce Road just south of the Saginaw–Bay county line.|$|E
5|$|The upper {{esophagus}} lies at {{the back}} of the mediastinum behind the trachea, adjoining along the tracheoesophageal stripe, and in front of the erector spinae muscles and the vertebral column. The lower esophagus lies behind the heart and curves in front of the thoracic aorta. From the bifurcation of the trachea downwards, the esophagus passes behind the right pulmonary artery, left main bronchus, and left atrium. At <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>it</b> passes through the diaphragm.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later, Olbers was again {{attempting}} to locate Ceres {{when he noticed}} another moving object in the vicinity. This was the asteroid Pallas, coincidentally passing near Ceres at the time. The discovery of this object created interest in the astronomy community. Before <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>it</b> had been speculated by astronomers {{that there should be}} a planet in the gap between Mars and Jupiter. Now, unexpectedly, a second such body had been found. When Pallas was discovered, some estimates of its size were as high as 3,380km in diameter. Even as recently as 1979, Pallas was estimated to be 673km in diameter, 26% greater than the currently accepted value.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{navigation}} ceased to operate from January 1869, Woodmill Lock remained in use, to enable barges to reach Gaters Mill at West End, {{which was on}} the main river channel just above {{the start of the}} first cut. Most of the bridges over {{the navigation}} were owned by the navigation, and their condition deteriorated. The manager, Mr Bulpett, was notified that he had 21 days to repair Shawford Bridge in 1879. He replied to the Winchester Highway Board that the navigation was insolvent, and he would help them to transfer responsibility for it to the county council. The Board carried out temporary repairs, when Bulpett agreed that the navigation would meet the full cost of repairing it properly if it ever reopened. The following year, Bulpett was threatened with legal action over the state of Bishopstoke Bridge, but at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>it</b> was agreed that the navigation had no income, and could not be sold, and so the county would have to maintain the bridges.|$|E
5|$|At 4:00pm, {{following}} {{a period of}} artillery preparation, the commandos launched their attack. Amidst thick mist and heavy rain, the attack went badly from the start. Shortly after stepping off, No. 5 Troop was ambushed by a German force disguised as locals, reducing its strength to just five men. The main assault force pressed on, although by now it consisted of only 67 men due to earlier losses. Part of the assault force—No. 6 Troop—took heavy fire and lost forward momentum; however, the other two troops gained {{the top of the}} hill and broke in to the German position. Upon reaching the summit they were greeted by an intense volume of heavy machine gun fire and at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>it</b> became clear that the preparatory bombardment had not been successful. Calls for further artillery support were denied due to a shortage of ammunition amongst the field batteries and eventually after a number of unsuccessful attempts at taking the position the commandos were forced to retire.|$|E
5|$|In the {{subsequent}} fiscal years 1941 and 1942, {{the federal government}} partially funded the education of 12,000 students at 309 nursing schools. Through that initiative, 3,800 inactive nurses received refresher courses and 4,800 graduated nurses received postgraduate training. By the end of 1942, 47,500 students were enrolled in nursing schools {{but that did not}} meet the country's need. At <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>it</b> was clear that nurses could not be trained quickly enough to keep abreast of both civilian and military needs. The need for additional federal aid for the recruitment of nurses became apparent when the U.S. Army and Navy called for 2,500 new nurses each month during the fiscal year 1943.|$|E

5|$|M-96 {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} between King Highway and Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) east of downtown Kalamazoo. From <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>it</b> follows King Highway over and then along the Kalamazoo River through a suburban residential area. The highway then follows Michigan Avenue east through Comstock {{and north of}} Morrow Lake. At Galesburg, M-96 turns northeast along Augusta Drive to Augusta, running through rural farmland. It turns eastward again, skirting the Fort Custer State Recreation Area and the Fort Custer National Cemetery. In Augusta, M-96 turns to follow Dickman Road to Battle Creek, passing north and east of the W. K. Kellogg Airport on Dickman and Helmer roads.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 July around 900 people formed outside the Bastille, {{primarily}} working-class members of the nearby faubourg Saint-Antoine, but also including some mutinous soldiers and local traders. The crowd had gathered {{in an attempt to}} commandeer the gunpowder stocks known to be held in the Bastille, and at 10:00 am de Launay let in two of their leaders to negotiate with him. Just after midday, another negotiator was let in to discuss the situation, but no compromise could be reached: the revolutionary representatives now wanted both the guns and the gunpowder in the Bastille to be handed over, but de Launay refused to do so unless he received authorisation from his leadership in Versailles. By <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>it</b> was clear that the governor lacked the experience or the skills to defuse the situation.|$|E
5|$|On {{the south}} side of Holland, the two {{highways}} split apart; US31 separates from I-196 at a partial interchange near the West Michigan Regional Airport (formerly the Tulip City Airport). At this interchange, northbound traffic may follow a left exit to continue on the BL I-196/US31 freeway or continue along I-196 which turns more eastward; the LMCT departs I-196 at this point as well. Signage along I-196 changes after this interchange. Up to <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>it</b> had been signed north–south, but from the US31 split onward, the directions are now signed east–west. The freeway passes to {{the south side}} of the airport, and it crosses a rail line owned by CSX Transportation and used by Amtrak's Pere Marquette train before curving northeasterly through the interchange with M-40. The freeway crosses into Ottawa County south of the Macatawa River before meeting the other two interchanges for Holland, the second of which is the northern end of the business loop in Zeeland.|$|E

Hauserman has been interviewed on the subject by AOL and TMZ. She stated that the Jenkins-Fiore situation was [...] "a very challenging time, I'm happy to move forward at <b>this</b> <b>point.</b> <b>It's</b> been a very upsetting, sad, tragic situation that nobody could have expected." ...|$|R

5|$|Richard de Rulos, who was Lord of Deeping Fen {{during the}} reign of William the Conqueror erected a strong {{embankment}} to prevent flooding of the meadows adjoining the river, which then became fertile fields and a pleasure garden. During the reign of Henry III (1207–1272), complaints were made that of the two channels below Crowland, the one to Spalding was more favourable to the passage of barges, but the Abbot of Crowland had obstructed and narrowed its course by planting willow trees. In the fourteenth century, Spalding was charged with failing to scour and repair the river, causing damage to the king's liege people, but argued that because it was tidal at <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>it</b> was an arm of the sea, and so they were not responsible.|$|E
5|$|The creek turns {{south and}} enters the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge 4.5 miles {{upstream}} from its mouth. At <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>it</b> passes through the largest freshwater marsh in Pennsylvania before becoming entirely tidal. It turns west-southwest for a few miles, passing by Philadelphia, Folcroft, Norwood, Prospect Park, Tinicum Township, and Ridley Township and receives the tributary Muckinipattis Creek from the right. Darby Creek winds through a large lagoon 30ft deep in places that was dredged in the 1960s. The creek then receives Stony Creek, its last named tributary, from the right and turns south for a few tenths of a mile before reaching its confluence with the Delaware River.|$|E
5|$|The {{demolition}} of the arcades of Freedom Square began in October 2010. Excavation {{works for the}} foundations of the Parliament House began soon after demolition was complete. In early 2011, the original plan was modified with the relocation of a staircase, the extension of one of the blocks, and changes {{in the design of the}} louvers on the facade. Construction started later that year, and the steel frame of the structure was complete by early 2012. At <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>it</b> began to be covered in limestone which had been quarried in Gozo, and cut into specific shapes in Italy, before being sent back to Malta. Between 120 and 150 workers were on the construction site every day, and it cost more than €90 million to build.|$|E
