5|$|In December 2014, the United States Justice Department allowed {{recognized}} Indian Reservations {{to regulate}} cannabis laws within their reservation. The laws in <b>the</b> <b>reservations</b> {{are allowed to}} be different from state and federal laws. As with State and Territories, the Federal government will not intervene as long as <b>the</b> <b>reservations</b> regulate strict control over marijuana. Some domestic nations such as the Yakama Nation and the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council rejected the approval to allow marijuana on their reservation.|$|E
5|$|Smith disbanded Ross's {{company in}} early September 1860. Within a week, Governor Sam Houston {{authorized}} Ross {{to raise his}} own company of 60 mounted volunteers to protect the settlements near Belknap from Native American attacks. Ross and his men arrived at Fort Belknap on October 17, 1860 to find the local citizens they were sworn to protect had passed a resolution asking Ross to resign his commission and leave the frontier. The citizens erroneously believed the raiding was committed by Native Americans from <b>the</b> <b>reservations,</b> and they feared Ross's friendship with those on <b>the</b> <b>reservations</b> would make him ineffective.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>{{reservation}}s</b> in Wisconsin {{were named}} the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation, and Lac du Flambeau Indian Reservation.

In Minnesota, <b>the</b> <b>reservations</b> for the Fond du Lac and the Grand Portage bands were established, with pending negotiations promised for the Bois Forte Band.

5|$|As a {{response}} to the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, Venizelos's power base was further strengthened, and on 8 October 1908 the Cretan Assembly passed a resolution in favor of union despite both <b>the</b> <b>reservations</b> of the Athens government under Georgios Theotokis and the objections of the Great Powers. The muted reaction of the Athens Government to the news from Crete led to an unsettled state of affairs on the mainland.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} 1868–1876, Sitting Bull {{developed}} {{into the most}} important of Native American political leaders. After the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) and the creation of the Great Sioux Reservation, many traditional Sioux warriors, such as Red Cloud of the Oglala and Spotted Tail of the Brulé, moved to reside permanently on <b>the</b> <b>reservations.</b> They were largely dependent for subsistence on the US Indian agencies. Many other chiefs, including members of Sitting Bull's Hunkpapa band such as Gall, at times lived temporarily at the agencies. They needed the supplies at a time when white encroachment and the depletion of buffalo herds reduced their resources and challenged Native American independence.|$|E
5|$|Neither treaty {{made any}} {{provision}} {{as to the}} mode or {{manner in which the}} removal of the Indians or surrender of <b>the</b> <b>reservations</b> was to take place. The grantees have assumed that they were authorized to take forcible possession of the two reservations, or of the four, as the case would have been under the first treaty. The plaintiff in this case was expelled by force; and unless this mode of removal can be sustained, the recovery against the defendants for the trespass was right, and must be affirmed.|$|E

25|$|As the {{demographic}} {{pressure from the}} colonists grew, the remaining Kalapuyans were forcibly removed to Indian reservations. Though some Natives escaped being swept into <b>the</b> <b>reservation,</b> most were moved to <b>the</b> Grand Ronde <b>reservation</b> in 1856. Strict racial segregation was enforced and mixed race people, known as Métis in French, {{had to make a}} choice between <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> and Anglo society. Native Americans could not leave <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> without traveling papers and white people could not enter <b>the</b> <b>reservation.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{effect of}} rural flight {{has not been}} spread evenly through South Dakota, however. Although most rural {{counties}} and small towns have lost population, the Sioux Falls area, the larger counties along Interstate 29, the Black Hills, and many Indian reservations have all gained population. As <b>the</b> <b>reservations</b> have exercised more sovereignty, some Sioux have returned to them from urban areas. Lincoln County near Sioux Falls was the seventh fastest-growing county (by percentage) in the United States in 2010. The growth in these areas has compensated for losses {{in the rest of}} the state. South Dakota's total population continues to increase steadily, albeit at a slower rate than the national average.|$|E
5|$|Although not an isolationist, Coolidge was {{reluctant}} to enter into foreign alliances. He considered the 1920 Republican victory as {{a rejection of the}} Wilsonian position that the United States should join the League of Nations. While not completely opposed to the idea, Coolidge believed the League, as then constituted, did not serve American interests, and he did not advocate membership. He spoke in favor of the United States joining the Permanent Court of International Justice (World Court), provided that the nation would not be bound by advisory decisions. In 1926, the Senate eventually approved joining the Court (with reservations). The League of Nations accepted <b>the</b> <b>reservations,</b> but it suggested some modifications of its own. The Senate failed to act; the United States never joined the World Court.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>reservations</b> {{of some of}} {{his senior}} ministers and governors, two months later, in January 811, al-Amin {{formally}} began the civil war when he appointed Ali ibn Isa governor of Khurasan, placed him at the head of an unusually large army of 40,000 men, drawn from the abnaʾ, and sent him to depose al-Ma'mun. When Ali ibn Isa set out for Khurasan, he reportedly took along a set of silver chains with which to bind al-Ma'mun and carry him back to Baghdad. The news of Ali's approach threw Khurasan into panic, and even al-Ma'mun considered fleeing. The only military force available to him was a small army of some 4,000–5,000 men, under Tahir ibn al-Husayn. Tahir was sent to confront Ali's advance, but it was widely regarded as almost a suicide mission, even by Tahir's own father. The two armies met at Rayy, on the western borders of Khurasan, and the ensuing battle (3 July 811) resulted in a crushing victory for the Khurasanis, in which Ali was killed and his army disintegrated on its flight west.|$|E

5|$|The mounted police {{assisted}} {{in the construction of}} the Canadian Pacific Railway, including relocating indigenous communities living along the route. The force established a wide network of posts and patrols, enabling them to protect and assist the ranchers who created huge cattle businesses across the prairies. The living conditions of the police on the prairies were spartan and often uncomfortable, and only slowly improved over the course of the century. Meanwhile, the railway enabled more settlers to migrate west, creating new towns and industries, while the force restricted the First Nations to <b>the</b> <b>reservations.</b> The mounted police faced challenges in adapting to the changing situation, especially when applying the unpopular prohibition laws to the white community. The force also became drawn into the growing number of industrial disputes between organised labour and company owners.|$|E
