500|$|Digital Spy's Lewis Corner {{gave the}} song a four (out of five)-star rating, and wrote that its {{production}} {{was of a}} [...] "summer anthem level". Corner said the track felt [...] "slightly lighter" [...] than Azalea's previous releases, adding: [...] "... but if it means she crosses over into superstardom territory, it's a job well done". While Robert Copsey of the same website believed that it [...] "felt like a somewhat needless moment of pop frivolity". Complex reviewers were also divided; Brian Josephs considered the track a [...] " [...] club banger", but David Drake criticized Azalea's [...] "nimble rapping and forced accent". According to Drake, [...] " [...] {{is the kind of}} thing <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>work</b> in the UK, where a digitally-animated frog once had a No. 1 hit with a cover of the theme to Beverly Hills Cop, but this will probably be a long shot at getting stateside club play". John Robinson of The Guardian felt it was [...] "second-division" [...] and [...] "sheeeeeit". Karen Lawler of Blues & Soul opined that it recalled [...] "a lost track" [...] from Miley Cyrus' 2013 album, Bangerz, and dismissed its [...] "nod" [...] to 2 Unlimited as [...] "cringe worthy". While Clash called [...] "Bounce" [...] an inferior version of [...] "No Limit" [...] and [...] "criminal in every way", and opined that it lacked tune; [...] "No Auto-Tune, though, because you need a tune to Auto".|$|E
60|$|Nick had {{not seen}} her at all for several weeks and had seen her but little for a year, but her off-hand cursory manner had not altered in the interval. She spoke remarkably fast, as if speech were not in itself a pleasure--to have it over as soon as possible; and her brusquerie was of the dark shade {{friendly}} critics account for by pleading shyness. Shyness had never appeared to him an ultimate quality or a real explanation of anything; it only explained an effect by another effect, neither with a cause to boast of. What he suspected in Julia was that her mind was less pleasing than her person; an ugly, a really blighting idea, which as yet he had but half accepted. It was {{a case in which}} she was entitled to the benefit of every doubt and oughtn't to be judged without a complete trial. Nick meanwhile was afraid of the trial--this was partly why he had been of late to see her so little--because he was afraid of the sentence, afraid of anything <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>work</b> to lessen the charm it was actually in the power of her beauty to shed. There were people who thought her rude, and he hated rude women. If he should fasten on that view, or rather if that view should fasten on him, what could still please and what he admired in her would lose too much of its sweetness. If it be thought odd that he had not yet been able to read the character of a woman he had known since childhood the answer is that this character had grown faster than Nick's observation. The growth was constant, whereas the observation was but occasional, though it had begun early. If he had attempted inwardly to phrase the matter, as he probably had not, he might have pronounced the effect she produced upon him too much a compulsion; not the coercion of design, of importunity, nor the vulgar pressure of family expectation, a betrayed desire he should like her enough to marry her, but a mixture of divers urgent things; of the sense that she was imperious and generous--probably more the former than the latter--and of a certain prevision of doom, the influence of the idea that he should come to it, that he was predestined.|$|E

5000|$|Following {{their name}} change to The Radioactive Chicken Heads, the band began {{transitioning}} into a less thrashy and more melodic style of punk rock, emphasizing an offbeat eclectic edge {{inspired by the}} likes of The Residents and Oingo Boingo, while also expanding their sound into occasional one-off genre experiments in styles ranging from reggae to rockabilly. The Chicken Heads' 2005 album Growing Mold featured a mix of punk, rock and blues songs interspersed with accordion and marimba-driven instrumentals, while their 2008 follow-up Music for Mutants returned to an entirely punk, rock and metal-oriented sound although with an increased use of keyboards and brass instruments.

5000|$|In 1995, Operation Ceasefire was {{established}} as a strategy for addressing youth gun violence in Boston. Violence was particularly concentrated in poor, inner-city neighborhoods including Roxbury, Dorchester, and Mattapan. There were 22 youths (under the age of 24) killed in Boston in 1987, with that figure rising to 73 in 1990. Operation Ceasefire entailed a problem-oriented policing approach, and focused on specific places that were crime hot spots—two strategies that when combined {{have been shown to}} be quite effective. Particular focus was placed on two elements of the gun violence problem, including illicit gun trafficking and gang violence. Within two years of implementing Operation Ceasefire in Boston, the number of youth homicides dropped to ten, with only one handgun-related youth homicide occurring in 1999 and 2000 The Operation Ceasefire strategy has since been replicated in other cities, including Los Angeles.
