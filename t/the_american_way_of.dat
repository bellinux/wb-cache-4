25|$|All {{cultures}} forged by nations – {{the noble}} indigenous past of America, the brilliant civilization of Europe, the wise history of Asian nations, and the ancestral wealth of Africa and Oceania – are corroded by <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life. In this way, neoliberalism imposes {{the destruction of}} nations and groups of nations in order to reconstruct them according to a single model. This is a planetary war, of the worst and cruelest kind, waged against humanity.|$|E
25|$|Kroc and the McDonald {{brothers}} feuded {{over control}} of the business, as documented in Kroc's autobiography. The San Bernardino restaurant was demolished in 1976 (1971, according to Juan Pollo) and the site was sold to the Juan Pollo restaurant chain. This area now serves as headquarters for the Juan Pollo chain, as well as a McDonald's and Route 66 museum. With the expansion of McDonald's into many international markets, the company has become a symbol of globalization and the spread of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life. Its prominence has also made it a frequent topic of public debates about obesity, corporate ethics, and consumer responsibility.|$|E
25|$|Japan {{would take}} {{advantage}} of Hitler's war in Europe to advance its own ambitions in the Far East. The Tripartite Pact guaranteed assistance if a signatory was attacked by any country not already involved {{in conflict with the}} signatory; this implicitly meant the U.S. By joining the pact, Japan gained geopolitical power and sent the unmistakable message that any U.S. military intervention risked war on both of her shores—with Germany and Italy on the Atlantic, and with Japan on the Pacific. The Roosevelt administration would not be dissuaded; believing <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life would be endangered if Europe and the Far East fell under military dictatorship, it committed to help the British and Chinese through loans of money and materiel, and pledged sufficient continuing aid to ensure their survival. Thus, the United States slowly moved from being a neutral power to one preparing for war.|$|E
40|$|Objectives. Among American Indians (AIs), an {{important}} {{relationship has been}} theorized between cultural identification and substance abuse, including smoking. We investigated the relationship between cultural identification and smoking among AI adults. Design. Using the Orthogonal Cultural Identification Scale (OCIS), we {{examined the relationship between}} AI and White cultural identification and cigarette use in a sample of AI recruited at an urban Indian center (n= 217). Results. We found that high AIs identification predicted smoker status and high White identification predicted non-smoker status when controlling for age and reservation residence. Orthogonal cultural identification status (categorized as high White/high AI, high White/low AI, low White/high AI, or low White/low AI) did not predict smoker status when controlling for age and reservation residence. OCIS item analysis revealed that positive responses to the individual OCIS items 'My family lives by <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Indian <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life,' 'I live by <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Indian <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life,' and 'I am a success in <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Indian <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life' predicted smoker status when controlling for age and reservation residence. Conclusions. Our data suggest that, among some groups of urban AIs, recreational smoking is associated with AI cultural identification...|$|R

25|$|However, the Communist Party's early {{labor and}} {{organizing}} successes did not last. As the decades progressed, the combined {{effects of the}} second Red Scare, McCarthyism, Nikita Khrushchev's 1956 Secret Speech denouncing the previous decades of Joseph Stalin's rule and the adversities of the continued Cold War mentality, steadily weakened the party's internal structure and confidence. The party's membership in the Comintern and its close adherence to the political positions of the Soviet Union made the party appear to most Americans as not only a threatening, subversive domestic entity, {{but also as a}} foreign agent fundamentally alien to <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life. Internal and external crises swirled together, to the point where members who did not end up in prison for party activities tended either to disappear quietly from its ranks or to adopt more moderate political positions at odds with the Communists' party line. By 1957, membership had dwindled to less than 10,000, of whom some 1,500 were informants for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).|$|E
25|$|Doughty's main {{inspiration}} for her advocacy work was the frequent {{absence of the}} decedents' families in the process, which she attributed to the Western death anxiety and death phobia. She wanted to encourage death acceptance, {{and a return to}} such practices as memento mori, reminders of one's own mortality, resulting in healthier grieving, mourning, and closure after the inevitable deaths of people around us, as well as starting a movement to broaden the funeral industry to offer more funeral options, such as natural burial, sky burial, alkaline hydrolysis (liquid cremation), or promession. Embalming began to dominate in the US after the Civil War. A century later, in the 1960s, Americans began to turn away from embalming and burial, as cremation became increasingly popular, so that today it is used in almost half of deaths in urban areas. Cremation is seen {{as a threat to the}} traditional funeral industry, but has a reputation as the more environmentally friendly option. This change can be traced to the lifting of the ban on cremation by Pope Paul VI in 1963, and to the publication in the same year of <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> Death by Jessica Mitford, documenting abuses in the funeral industry and criticizing the excessive cost of funerals. Mitford's book, and the movement it started, was one of Doughty's inspirations, but Doughty feels that while Mitford had the right target, the profit-driven funeral industry, Mitford erred in sharing the industry's, and the public's, unhealthy desire to push out of sight and avoid thinking about the corpse itself. Doughty seeks to build on Mitford's reforms but in a direction that embraces the reality of death and returns to funeral and mourning practices that include spending time with and having contact with the dead body itself.|$|E

500|$|He read Jessica Mitford's book <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> Death Revisited, which {{discusses}} the funeral industry, {{and was able}} to take a tour with funeral salesmen at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. At the time, he did not reveal that this was for research, and instead pretended to have a dying relative. According to Maxtone-Graham, the tour helped him find out [...] "all about urns versus coffins, and cremation. I asked sort of questions about, 'Well, do the bodies smell?'

500|$|When President Dwight Eisenhower {{took office}} in 1953, he {{strengthened}} and extended Truman's loyalty review program, while decreasing the avenues of appeal available to dismissed employees.

[...] The following year, J. Robert Oppenheimer, scientific director of the Manhattan Project that built the first atomic bomb, then working {{as a consultant to}} the Atomic Energy Commission, was stripped of his security clearance after a four-week hearing.

500|$|Baltimore {{resident}} Michael Psenicska sought {{more than}} $100,000 in damages from Baron Cohen, 20th Century Fox, and other parties. Psenicska—a high school mathematics teacher who also owns a driving school—was reportedly paid $500 in cash to give Baron Cohen's bogus Kazakh journalist a driving lesson. In his action—filed in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan—the driving instructor {{said that he}} had been told the film was a [...] "documentary about the integration of foreign people into <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life", and that if he had known the film's true nature, he would have never participated. Psenicska said he was entitled to damages because the defendants used images of him to advertise the film. The case was dismissed on 9 September 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Lovins {{explains}} that this danger {{comes not from}} hostile ideology but from misapplied technology. [...] The size, complexity, pattern, and control structure of the electrical power system make it inherently vulnerable to large-scale failures.

Reliance on these delicately poised energy systems has unwittingly put at risk <b>the</b> entire <b>American</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life.|$|R

500|$|Disney {{grew more}} {{politically}} conservative {{as he got}} older. A Democratic Party supporter until the 1940 presidential election, when he switched allegiance to the Republicans, he became a generous donor to ThomasE.Dewey's 1944 bid for the presidency. In 1946 he was {{a founding member of}} the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, an organization who stated they [...] "believ in, and like, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> Life... we find ourselves in sharp revolt against a rising tide of Communism, Fascism and kindred beliefs, that seek by subversive means to undermine and change this way of life". In 1947, during the Second Red Scare, Disney testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), where he branded Herbert Sorrell, David Hilberman and William Pomerance, former animators and labor union organizers, as communist agitators; Disney stated that the 1941 strike led by them was part of an organized communist effort to gain influence in Hollywood.|$|E
500|$|Postmodern {{cultural}} critic bell hooks {{cited the}} interaction in the Memphis train station between Thomas and the Japanese couple {{as one of}} the few examples of nuanced, deconstructive and subversive treatment of blackness in American film. In his original review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert proclaimed that [...] "he best thing about Mystery Train is that it takes you to an America you feel you ought to be able to find for yourself, if you only knew where to look." [...] He later included the movie in his Great Movies collection, comparing the movie favorably to Jarmusch's later efforts like Dead Man and The Limits of Control. In an April 2000 retrospective of Jarmusch's work for Sight & Sound, Shawn Levy concluded that the film was [...] "as much a valentine to the allure of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> pop culture as it is a cheeky bit of structural legerdemain without terribly much resonating significance".|$|E
500|$|Sales {{of coins}} at the Exposition were {{handled by the}} Commission; those by mail were dealt with by the Franklin Trust Company. [...] The half dollar was priced at $1, and the quarter eagle at $4; however they did not sell well and the Commission's belief it could sell the entire mintage proved wildly optimistic. Although six million people visited the Exposition, 859,408 of the 1,000,000 half dollars were {{returned}} to the mint for melting. Similarly, 154,207 quarter eagles of the mintage of 200,000 were returned for melting. This {{did not take place}} all at once: 420,000 half dollars had been returned by January 1930, with the rest later. According to coin dealer B. Max Mehl in his 1937 volume on commemoratives, [...] "Philadelphia with a population of over 2,000,000 people... could and should have sold a greater number of coins". Arlie R. Slabaugh wrote in his 1975 book on the same subject, [...] "we have been called complacent about our independence and <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life in recent years—judging by the sale of these coins, it must have been much worse in 1926!" ...|$|E
40|$|Ao dai is {{a typical}} long dress of Viet Nam used to be worn by {{both men and women}} of the Viet and other ethnic peoples.
