50|$|The enamel plaques on the {{circular}} band, the panel depicting Christ Pantokrator, and <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> Emperor Michael were all {{affixed to the}} crown using different techniques. <b>The</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emperor could not {{be attached to the}} rim {{in the same way as}} <b>the</b> Pantokrator <b>picture</b> on <b>the</b> front. The frame was folded upwards and <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emperor was nailed to the edge.

25|$|In December 1982, the {{dam site}} was {{occupied}} by protesters, leading to widespread arrests and greater publicity. The dispute became a federal issue the following March, when a campaign in the national print media, assisted by <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> photographer Peter Dombrovskis, helped bring down the government of Malcolm Fraser at the 1983 election. The new government, under Bob Hawke, had promised to stop the dam from being built.

25|$|When {{we hear a}} car honk, {{we would}} {{determine}} which car triggers the honk by which car we see is the spatially closest to the honk.

On the other hand, the sound and <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> a TV program would be integrated as structural congruent by combining visual and auditory stimuli. However, if {{the sound and the}} pictures were not meaningfully fit, we would segregate the two stimuli. Therefore, whether spatial or structural congruent should not only combine the stimuli but also be determined by understanding.|$|E
