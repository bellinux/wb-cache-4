5|$|Carleton {{addressed}} the weak {{points of the}} town's defensive fortifications: he had two log barricades and palisades erected along the Saint Lawrence shoreline, within the area covered by his cannons; he assigned his forces to defensive positions along <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> inner defenses; and he made sure his inexperienced militia were under strong leadership.|$|E
5|$|In 16th century England, Henry VIII began {{building}} Device Forts between 1539 and 1540 as artillery fortresses {{to counter the}} threat of invasion from France and Spain. They were built by the state at strategic points for the first powerful cannon batteries, such as Deal Castle, which was perfectly symmetrical, with a low, circular keep at its centre. Over 200 cannon and gun ports were set within <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fort was essentially a firing platform, with a shape that allowed many lines of fire; its low curved bastions were designed to deflect cannonballs.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, the {{congregation}} voted {{by a margin}} of over two to one to re-orient the synagogue pews in the manner of Christian churches, and introduce mixed seating. However, nothing was done about this until 1879, when the renovations were carried out: the front pews were removed, the side pews extended to <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> vestibule moved outside the sanctuary. Led by rabbi Dr. E. M. Myers, the synagogue was re-dedicated on September 7.|$|E

40|$|Key words: {{diversion}} tunnel; {{textural stress}}; stress distribution; failure peculiarity Abstract. The textural stress has great {{effect on the}} stability of rock. According to the measured geo-stress data, through FEM <b>and</b> combined with <b>the</b> linear multivariate regression method, the geo-stress field was conducted. Using these methods, a diversion tunnel of a large-scale hydropower station was analyzed to study the stress distribution. It was shown that the stress concentration was located at <b>the</b> bottom of <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> arch top, the stress in <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> was little <b>and</b> <b>the</b> failure happened at <b>the</b> bottom of <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> arch top, then <b>the</b> bottom board <b>and</b> some areas far from the tunnel. Under the condition without considering textural stress, the stress concentration area located in <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> failure happened {{at the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> then in <b>the</b> middle of <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> at <b>the</b> arch top...|$|R

5|$|Richard rebuilt <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> gatehouses at Launceston, {{building}} a high tower {{to increase the}} height of the keep, probably to allow guests to enjoy the view of his deer park. The bailey was cleared of its older buildings and a new great hall was constructed in the south-west corner. The castle's inhabitants ate well, enjoying a wide range of food including prime cuts of venison brought into the castle, probably mostly from the larger deer parks belonging to the earldom across the region.|$|E
5|$|The British {{arrival in}} Jerusalem heralded a {{rational}} philosophy of infrastructure planning and development. It respected cultural and historic heritage {{and attempted to}} preserve such elements within the blossoming construction of the modern city. The city walls were identified as such an element, so British workers acted to clear away the stalls on their perimeter and maintain an open area between <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rest of the New City {{in the interest of}} an aesthetically pleasing visual basin. By the same token, planners demolished the Ottoman clock tower to preserve a historic skyline.|$|E

5|$|Further {{disturbances}} {{took place}} during the troubled reign of Mary, Queen of Scots (1542–1567), and its aftermath. In 1558 the Protestant Lords of the Congregation marched on Edinburgh against the Catholic French Regent, Mary of Guise, and were able {{to take control of the}} town without difficulty, despite the guards posted at the city gate. Following the forced abdication of Queen Mary, Scotland's nobility was divided between her supporters, and those of the infant King James VI, represented by a series of regents. Edinburgh was held for the Queen by William Kirkcaldy of Grange, and in May 1571 the town was besieged by the Regent's forces under James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton. Repairs were made to <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Netherbow was barricaded. Nearby houses were pulled down to improve defences, and the siege gun Mons Meg was employed to batter houses outside the wall which were being used by snipers. Unable to make any headway, the besiegers withdrew on 20 May.|$|E
5|$|Significant leaks in {{the roof}} were {{reported}} in 1997 and a massive restoration project took place. This entailed fixing the roof, repainting <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> niche housing the statue of the Immaculate Conception, replacing tiles, enhancing the lighting and sound system and installing new stained glass windows in the Chapel of Our Lord's Passion, which was rededicated to the Chinese Martyrs. The renovation was completed on 8 December 2002 and cost a total of US$1.1 million. The project's success in preserving the building's heritage resulted in the cathedral being given an honourable mention at the 2003 UNESCO Asia Pacific Heritage Awards for Culture Heritage Conservation and presented with the award on its anniversary in 2003.|$|E
5|$|The {{inner and}} outer walls were {{constructed}} similarly with the outer wall measuring nine feet high and 18 inches thick, which was also coated in plaster. The outer wall {{is believed to have}} been constructed during the fifteenth century. The construction of the inner wall has been attributed to the Portuguese presence along the coast in the sixteenth century, whilst the presence of gun ports has been used to infer that the walls were not constructed earlier. However, the practicality of the walls as defensive fortification is unclear, since according to Kirkman the walls and gates surrounding the town have no significant strength, which seems to conform to a proposal that <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> layout of buildings were used to maintain social barriers. Although the inner wall has a more obvious defensive function and despite the absence of gun ports and the questionable strength of the outer wall, it has nonetheless been credited as being a fortification.|$|E

5|$|In 1476 {{the castle}} passed to John Howard, the Duke of Norfolk, who {{probably}} began {{the sequence of}} improvements to the castle during the Tudor period. Under the Howards the castle was extensively modernised; fashionable brick was used to improve parts of the castle; ornamental chimneys were added; the battlements were reduced in size to exaggerate the apparent height of <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Howard coat of arms {{was added to the}} gatehouse. The Great Chamber was probably built across the Inner Court at this time, linking the Great Hall with the chapel and chambers {{on the east side of}} the castle, and by 1524 there were at least 29 different rooms in the castle. The drawbridge outside the gatehouse was replaced with the current permanent bridge between 1524–47; by this time a half-moon defensive structure had been built in stone to defend it. A pleasure garden had been built in the Lower Court by the 16th century, with several ornamental ponds and terraced walkways – the garden would probably have also had fruit trees, herb gardens and fountains. Another pleasure garden was built in the Bailey, and a second bridge built across the moat to allow access to it directly from the Inner Court. The Prison Tower was redesigned to become a viewing gallery for the new formal gardens below.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{parts of}} the church date from around 1300, but {{it is likely that}} a timber-framed church existed on the site before then. The church's {{original}} dedication was to SaintLawrence, but that was later changed to SaintMary. A clerestory was added in the 15thcentury. The tower was built in 1530, and the Stanley pew was added in about 1600. The west gallery, which contained an organ, was installed in 1803. In 1856, the chancel was completely rebuilt, to a design by Cuffley and Starkey, paid for by the Stanley family. The vestry was constructed in 1860. The church was restored between 1877 and 1878 by Paley and Austin; the nave floor was lowered, the pulpit was replaced, plaster was removed from the roof and <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> box pews were replaced by new oak pews. The tower clock, made in 1743, was renovated in 1997. In 2000, the 16th-century wooden bell-frame was strengthened by the addition of a steel frame, and the Stanley pew was restored.|$|E
