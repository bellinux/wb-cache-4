40|$|AbstractMutations in the Drosophila <b>trol</b> gene cause {{cell cycle}} arrest of {{neuroblast}}s in the larval brain. Here, {{we show that}} <b>trol</b> encodes the Drosophila homolog of Perlecan and regulates neuroblast division by modulating both FGF and Hh signaling. Addition of human FGF- 2 to <b>trol</b> mutant brains in culture rescues the <b>trol</b> proliferation phenotype, while addition of a MAPK inhibitor causes cell cycle arrest of the regulated neuroblasts in wildtype brains. Like FGF, Hh activates stem cell division in the larval brain in a Trol-dependent fashion. Coimmunoprecipitation studies are consistent with interactions between <b>Trol</b> and Hh and between mammalian Perlecan and Shh that are not competed with heparin sulfate. Finally, analyses of mutations in <b>trol,</b> hh, and ttv suggest that <b>Trol</b> affects Hh movement. These results indicate that <b>Trol</b> can mediate signaling through both of the FGF and Hedgehog pathways to control the onset of stem cell proliferation in the developing nervous system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Heparan sulfate {{proteoglycans}} modulate signaling by {{a variety}} of growth factors. The mammalian proteoglycan Perlecan binds and regulates signaling by Sonic Hedgehog, Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGFs), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF), among others, in contexts ranging from angiogenesis and cardiovascular development to cancer progression. The Drosophila Perlecan homolog <b>trol</b> has been shown to regulate the activity of Hedgehog and Branchless (an FGF homolog) to control the onset of stem cell proliferation in the developing brain during first instar. Here we extend analysis of <b>trol</b> mutant phenotypes to show that <b>trol</b> is required for a variety of developmental events and modulates signaling by multiple growth factors in different situations. Results Different mutations in <b>trol</b> allow developmental progression to varying extents, suggesting that <b>trol</b> is involved in multiple cell-fate and patterning decisions. Analysis of the initiation of neuroblast proliferation at second instar demonstrated that <b>trol</b> regulates this event by modulating signaling by Hedgehog and Branchless, as it does during first instar. <b>Trol</b> protein is distributed over the surface of the larval brain, near the regulated neuroblasts that reside on the cortical surface. Mutations in <b>trol</b> also decrease the number of circulating plasmatocytes. This is likely to be due to decreased expression of pointed, the response gene for VEGF/PDGF signaling that is required for plasmatocyte proliferation. <b>Trol</b> is found on plasmatocytes, where it could regulate VEGF/PDGF signaling. Finally, we show that in second instar brains but not third instar brain lobes and eye discs, mutations in <b>trol</b> affect signaling by Decapentaplegic (a Transforming Growth Factor family member), Wingless (a Wnt growth factor) and Hedgehog. Conclusion These studies extend the known functions of the Drosophila Perlecan homolog <b>trol</b> in both developmental and signaling contexts. These studies also highlight the fact that <b>Trol</b> function is not dedicated to a single molecular mechanism, but is capable of regulating different growth factor pathways depending on the cell-type and event underway. </p...|$|R

FNR is recruited to thylakoid membranes via integral membrane thylakoid rhodanase-like protein <b>TROL.</b> We address the fate of electrons downstream of photosystem I when <b>TROL</b> is absent. We have employed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to study free radical formation and electron partitioning in TROL-depleted chloroplasts. DMPO was used to detect superoxide anion (O 2. −) formation, while the generation of other free radicals was monitored by Tiron. Chloroplasts from <b>trol</b> plants pre-acclimated to different light conditions consistently exhibited diminished O 2. − accumulation. Generation of other radical forms was elevated in <b>trol</b> chloroplasts in all tested conditions, except for the plants pre-acclimated to high-light.

5|$|Before season 20, {{little was}} shown {{concerning}} Cartman's romantic interests, {{as for the}} most part, his attitude towards females had been sexist. However, at least in one episode ("Chef Goes Nanners"), Cartman develops an attraction to Wendy, which is apparent {{from the end of}} episode when Wendy describes her temporary infatuation towards Cartman as 'sexual tension' and even though Cartman agrees in front of Wendy, he sighs with sorrow at being alone again. During a period when he was physically unable to control his speech and he repeatedly blurted hidden feelings, he expressed a romantic interest in classmate Patty Nelson, a side character who has not been seen before or since. In Season 20, after Cartman is wrongfully accused of being a persistent and highly aggressive internet troll (actually Gerald Broflovski) leaving foul posts primarily targeting women and girls on South Park Elementary's school message boards, the other boys destroy most of Cartman's electronics, and by extension, his social media presence, causing him to become despondent to everything around him.

25|$|Commercial <b>trolling</b> vessels {{catch fish}} by towing astern {{one or more}} <b>trolling</b> lines. The <b>trolling</b> lines are fishing lines with natural or {{artificial}} baited hooks trailed by a vessel near the surface or at a certain depth. Several lines can be towed {{at the same time}} using outriggers to keep the lines apart. The lines can be hauled in manually or by small winches. A length of rubber is often included in each line as a shock absorber. The <b>trolling</b> line is towed at a speed depending on the target species, from 2.3 knots up to at least 7 knots. Trollers range from small open boats to large refrigerated vessels 30 meters long. In many tropical artisanal fisheries, <b>trolling</b> is done with sailing canoes with outriggers for stability. With properly designed vessels, <b>trolling</b> is an economical and efficient way of catching tuna, mackerel and other pelagic fish swimming close to the surface.

40|$|AbstractThe heparin sulfate {{proteoglycan}} Terribly Reduced Optic Lobes (<b>Trol)</b> is the Drosophila melanogaster homolog of the vertebrate protein Perlecan. <b>Trol</b> {{is expressed}} {{as part of}} the extracellular matrix (ECM) found in the hematopoietic organ, called the lymph gland. In the normal lymph gland, the ECM forms thin basement membranes around individual or small groups of blood progenitors. The pattern of basement membranes, reported by <b>Trol</b> expression, is spatio-temporally correlated to hematopoiesis. The central, medullary zone which contain undifferentiated hematopoietic progenitors has many, closely spaced membranes. Fewer basement membranes are present in the outer, cortical zone, where differentiation of blood cells takes place. Loss of <b>trol</b> causes a dramatic change of the ECM into a three-dimensional, spongy mass that fills wide spaces scattered throughout the lymph gland. At the same time proliferation is reduced, leading to a significantly smaller lymph gland. Interestingly, differentiation of blood progenitors in <b>trol</b> mutants is precocious, resulting in the break-down of the usual zonation of the lymph gland. which normally consists of an immature center (medullary zone) where cells remain undifferentiated, and an outer cortical zone, where differentiation sets in. We present evidence that the effect of <b>Trol</b> on blood cell differentiation is mediated by Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, which is known to be required to maintain an immature medullary zone. Overexpression of hh in the background of a <b>trol</b> mutation is able to rescue the premature differentiation phenotype. Our data provide novel insight into the role of the ECM component Perlecan during Drosophila hematopoiesis...|$|R
40|$|Developmental {{signaling}} pathways {{have many}} diverse roles throughout {{the life of}} an organism. The proper regulation of these pathways is essential for normal development, and misregulation can lead to diseases such as cancer. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans function to modulate growth factor signaling in many biological processes by acting as co-receptors, or by influencing ligand distribution. The heparan sulfate proteoglycan <b>Trol,</b> the Drosophila Perlecan homolog, is known to modulate signaling in a population of neuroblasts in the developing Drosophila central nervous system. My studies aim to determine the function <b>Trol</b> has in regulating signaling pathways during development. <b>trol</b> mutants are examined to determine how various mutant alleles impact signaling in several different developmental contexts. The role growth factor pathways play during induction of a Drosophila prostate cancer model is also examined. Gene expression profiles are determined for two types of prostate model overproliferation. <b>Trol</b> is shown to be able to differentially regulate multiple signaling pathways during several developmental processes. The Drosophila prostate cancer model is also shown to have many characteristics similar to those of human prostate cancer, and that signaling and proteoglycan expression are impacted by aberrant overgrowth in the model. My results indicate that <b>Trol</b> is able to specifically modulate different signaling pathways depending on the tissue and developmental context...|$|R

40|$|Gastrulation of {{the embryo}} {{involves}} coordinate cell movements likely supported by multiple signaling pathways, adhesion molecules, and extracellular matrix components. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) {{have a major}} role in Drosophila melanogaster mesoderm migration, however few other inputs are known and the mechanism supporting cell movement is unclear. To provide insight, we carried out an ectopic expression screen to identify secreted or membrane-associated molecules that act to support mesoderm migration. Twenty-four UAS insertions were identified that cause lethality when expressed in either the mesoderm (Twi-Gal 4) or ectoderm (69 B-Gal 4). The list was narrowed to a subset of ten genes that were shown to exhibit loss-of-function mutant phenotypes specifically affecting mesoderm migration. These include the FGF ligand Pyramus, α-integrins, E-cadherin, Cueball, EGFR, JAK/STAT signaling components, as well as the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) Terribly reduced optic lobes (<b>Trol).</b> <b>Trol</b> encodes the ortholog of mammalian HSPG Perlecan, a demonstrated FGF signaling cofactor. Here we examine the role of <b>Trol</b> in Drosophila mesoderm migration and compare and contrast its role with that of Syndecan (Sdc), another HSPG, previously implicated in this process. Embryos mutant for <b>Trol</b> or Sdc were obtained and analyzed.
