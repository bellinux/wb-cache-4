Based on his research, Zhao proposed six favorable regions for doing further exploration in 1995 in NW China, which have been proved by a number of exploration wells and discoveries to be the best regions where traps the major oil/gas accumulations of Jurassic and Jurassic source rock-related in NW China.According to statistics, so far the proved oil and gas reserves discovered in Zhao’s predicted six zones have exceeded 1.5 billion <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>equivalents,</b> which has yearly provided more than 15 million <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>equivalents.</b> It is also confirmed that there is no oil and gas reserve output outside these 6 zones.
