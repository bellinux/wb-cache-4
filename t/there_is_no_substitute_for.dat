A threaded standoff {{is essentially a}} hollow metal tube with internal threads. One end is secured with a screw {{through a hole in}} the PCB. The other end accepts a screw which compresses the spring, completing the assembly. A typical heat sink assembly uses two to four standoffs, which tends to make this the most costly heat sink attachment design. Another disadvantage is the need for holes in the PCB.|$|E

For scenes {{taking place in}} Manhattan, visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison shot aerial footage for over three days to use as background plates, elaborating that his main objective was to [...] "get as much aerial work in as possible for the audience to see the big expanses, the wide establishing shots, while also {{making sure that the}} effects work doesn't look too computer generated". [...] "We're getting much better at making entirely computer-generated environments," [...] Morrison explained, [...] "but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> starting with a real image and adding what you need." ...|$|E

Windle was usually {{regarded}} as the fittest and hardest-working member of the Australian swimming team. In retirement, Windle stayed in the United States {{for a few more}} years, working for Allis-Chalmers, an agricultural equipment corporation. He returned home after being transferred to the Australian division of the firm's operations. Windle was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1987 and the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1990.|$|E

6000|$|The Kalamazoo is {{a crooked}} stream; and it wound from {{the spot where}} le Bourdon had built his cabin, to a point within a hundred yards of the fallen tree in which the bees had {{constructed}} their hive. As a matter of course, Ben profited by this circumstance to carry his canoe to the latter place, {{with a view to}} render it serviceable in transporting the honey. First securing everything in and around the chiente, he and Gershom embarked, taking with them no less than four pieces of fire-arms; one of which was, to use the language of the west, a double-barrelled [...] "shot-gun." [...] Before quitting the place, however, the bee-hunter went to a large kennel made of logs, and let out a mastiff of great power and size. Between this dog and himself there existed the best possible intelligence; the master having paid many visits to the prisoner since his return, feeding and caressing him. Glad, indeed, was this fine animal to be released, bounding back and forth, and leaping about le Bourdon in a way to manifest his delight. He had been cared for in his kennel, and well cared for, too; but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> liberty, whether in man or beast, individuals or communities.|$|E

60|$|I {{feel as if}} it {{were not}} for me to record, even though this {{manuscript}} is intended for no eyes but mine, how hard I worked at that tremendous short-hand, and all improvement appertaining to it, in my sense of responsibility to Dora and her aunts. I will only add, to what I have already written of my perseverance at this time of my life, and of a patient and continuous energy which then began to be matured within me, and which I know to be the strong part of my character, if it have any strength at all, that there, on looking back, I find the source of my success. I have been very fortunate in worldly matters; many men have worked much harder, and not succeeded half so well; but I never could have done what I have done, without the habits of punctuality, order, and diligence, without the determination to concentrate myself on one object at a time, no matter how quickly its successor should come upon its heels, which I then formed. Heaven knows I write this, in no spirit of self-laudation. The man who reviews his own life, as I do mine, in going on here, from page to page, had need to have been a good man indeed, if he would be spared the sharp consciousness of many talents neglected, many opportunities wasted, many erratic and perverted feelings constantly at war within his breast, and defeating him. I do not hold one natural gift, I dare say, that I have not abused. My meaning simply is, that whatever I have tried to do in life, I have tried with all my heart to do well; that whatever I have devoted myself to, I have devoted myself to completely; that in great aims and in small, I have always been thoroughly in earnest. I have never believed it possible that any natural or improved ability can claim immunity from the companionship of the steady, plain, hard-working qualities, and hope to gain its end. There is no such thing as such fulfilment on this earth. Some happy talent, and some fortunate opportunity, may form the two sides of the ladder on which some men mount, but the rounds of that ladder must be made of stuff to stand wear and tear; and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> thorough-going, ardent, and sincere earnestness. Never to put one hand to anything, on which I could throw my whole self; and never to affect depreciation of my work, whatever it was; I find, now, to have been my golden rules.|$|E
