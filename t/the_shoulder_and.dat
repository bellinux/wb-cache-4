5|$|The {{black-shouldered kite}} {{is very similar}} to the related raptor species, the letter-winged kite (E.scriptus) but has the black mark above and behind the eye, a white rather than grey crown, and shows all-white underparts in flight except for the black patch at <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> dark wingtips.|$|E
5|$|Debra, who {{is staying}} at Dexter's apartment, is exercising incessantly and {{barely able to}} sleep as she struggles with {{memories}} of Brian, her ex-fiancé, trying to kill her. She returns {{to work at the}} police station; Sgt. María LaGuerta (Lauren Vélez) expresses concern about her emotional stability, but Debra is determined to resume a normal lifestyle. When she takes Rita out to a bar, a man recognizes Debra as the fiancée of the Ice Truck Killer. He touches her on <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> she instinctively punches him in the nose, certain {{that he was trying to}} grab her.|$|E
5|$|During the Mexican–American War, Beauregard {{served as}} an {{engineer}} under General Winfield Scott. He was appointed brevet captain for the battles of Contreras and Churubusco and major for Chapultepec, where he was wounded in <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> thigh. He was noted for his eloquent performance {{in a meeting with}} Scott in which he convinced the assembled general officers to change their plan for attacking the fortress of Chapultepec. He {{was one of the first}} officers to enter Mexico City. Beauregard considered his contributions in dangerous reconnaissance missions and devising strategy for his superiors to be more significant than those of his engineer colleague, Captain Robert E. Lee, so he was disappointed when Lee and other officers received more brevets than he did.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{motion is}} {{classified}} {{according to the}} anatomical plane it occurs in. Flexion and extension are examples of angular motions, in which two axes of a joint are brought closer together or moved further apart. Rotational motion may occur at other joints, for example <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> are described as internal or external. Other terms, such as elevation and depression, describe movement above or below the horizontal plane. Many anatomical terms derive from Latin terms with the same meaning.|$|E
5|$|Aluminium {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} manufactured by cold extrusion of aluminium billets {{in a process}} which first presses the walls and base, then trims {{the top edge of}} the cylinder walls, followed by press forming <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> neck. The final structural process is machining the neck outer surface, boring and cutting the neck threads and O-ring groove. The cylinder is then heat-treated, tested and stamped with the required permanent markings. Aluminium diving cylinders commonly have flat bases, which allows them to stand upright on horizontal surfaces, and which are relatively thick to allow for rough treatment and considerable wear. This makes them heavier than they need to be for strength, but the extra weight at the base also helps keep the centre of gravity low which gives better balance in the water and reduces excess buoyancy.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} overseas, Red Cloud {{contracted}} diseases frequently, {{and he was}} returned to the United States in February 1943 to recuperate. The Navy doctors in San Diego that examined Red Cloud offered him a medical discharge, but Red Cloud refused. Instead, he recovered from illness and requested reassignment to a combat unit. This request was granted, with Red Cloud subsequently assigned to Weapons Platoon, A Company, 29th Marine Regiment, 6th Marine Division, which participated in the invasion of Okinawa on 1 April 1945. On 17 May, {{he was shot in}} <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> evacuated to Guam. In the ensuing Battle of Okinawa, his unit saw intense fighting in the campaign to secure the island. After several months of fighting, the unit was withdrawn to Guam to prepare for Operation Coronet, {{the second phase of the}} anticipated invasion of mainland Japan. However, these plans were scrapped following the surrender of Japan. Red Cloud was honorably discharged as a sergeant from the Marine Corps on 9 November, 1945 during the demobilization that followed the war.|$|E

5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} may {{be manufactured}} from steel plate discs, which are cold {{drawn to a}} cylindrical cup form, {{in two or three}} stages, and generally have a domed base if intended for the scuba market, so they cannot stand up by themselves. After forming the base and side walls, the top of the cylinder is trimmed to length, heated and hot spun to form <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> close the neck. This process thickens the material of the shoulder. The cylinder is heat-treated by quenching and tempering to provide the best strength and toughness. The cylinders are machined to provide the neck thread and o-ring seat (if applicable), then chemically cleaned or shot-blasted inside and out to remove mill-scale. After inspection and hydrostatic testing they are stamped with the required permanent markings, followed by external coating with a corrosion barrier paint or hot dip galvanising.|$|E
5|$|While in transit, as {{a result}} of {{overcrowding}} in training camps in the United Kingdom, the 1st Division was diverted to Egypt with the intention that it would complete its training there before moving to the Western Front at a later date. The decision by the Allies to force a passage through the Dardanelles interrupted this process, as the 1st Division was allocated {{to take part in the}} Gallipoli Campaign. During the landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, Bennett fought on the southern flank of the Anzac beachhead. He led 300 men of his battalion to an advanced position on Pine Ridge, south of Lone Pine. While directing the defence of this position, Bennett was wounded in <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> wrist and forced to retire to the beach for treatment. When the Turkish forces counter-attacked in the evening, the 6th Battalion force on Pine Ridge was isolated and killed to the last man, including Bennett's younger brother, Godfrey. Instead of accepting evacuation on a hospital ship, after having his wounds treated, Bennett returned to his battalion.|$|E
5|$|Piper {{reported}} {{that as he}} was leaving Exchange Buildings to return to Houndsditch he saw a man acting suspiciously {{in the shadows of the}} cul-de-sac. As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately , pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats—constables Woodhams and Choate—who watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs, they soon realised that someone was watching them from the stairs. The police asked the man if they could step into the back of the property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man on the stairs also began firing. Bentley was shot in <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> the neck—the second round severing his spine. Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg, which broke his femur; both collapsed. Although they survived, neither Bryant or Woodhams fully recovered from their injuries.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, modern {{equipment}} {{was developed to}} reduce injuries. The football helmet, although a scapegoat for concussions, serves as effective protection against more dangerous injuries like skull fractures. The modern helmet traces its roots back to the leather helmets used by football players in the early 1900s {{to protect themselves from}} head injuries. Helmets later evolved to be made of hard plastic, and a facemask was added to protect players from sustaining facial injuries. Many players also wear mouthguards to prevent injuries to their teeth and tongues; at some levels, such as the NCAA, the use of a mouthguard is mandatory. Football players wear a number of pads to protect themselves – shoulder pads are the most important pads, protecting <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> sternum, but thigh pads, hip pads, tail pads, and knee pads are also used. Many quarterbacks wear flak jackets to protect their ribcage. Cleats come in a number of lengths, with players choosing which cleat to use based on the playing field – on artificial turf, for example, players prefer a shorter cleat to prevent their feet from digging into the ground and risking injury, while longer cleats are generally used on fields that are wet or slippery to provide better traction. Athletic cups are not typically used at the professional level, because athletic cups tend to make it harder to move and there is an unwritten code among players not to target the groin area. Additionally, studies have shown that proper conditioning techniques, fitness routines and exercise routines, as well as high-quality equipment and coaching, can reduce the risk of injury among players.|$|E

50|$|In common parlance, {{the core}} of the body is broadly {{considered}} to be the torso. Functional movements are highly dependent on this part of the body, and lack of core muscular development can result in a predisposition to injury. The major muscles of the core reside {{in the area of the}} belly and the mid and lower back (not <b>the</b> <b>shoulders),</b> <b>and</b> peripherally include <b>the</b> hips, <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> neck.|$|R
25|$|The Battalion's uniform is {{primarily}} an army-like shade of olive green. The shoulders feature black bars, with white outlining, this is then further outlined in black.

25|$|Doctors treat a {{dislocation}} {{by putting}} {{the head of the}} humerus back into the joint socket (glenoid fossa) of the scapula — a procedure called manipulation and reduction (M). This is usually followed up with an x ray to make sure the reduction did not fracture the surrounding bones. The arm is then immobilized in a sling or a device called a shoulder immobilizer for several days. Usually the doctor recommends resting <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> applying ice {{three or four times a}} day. After pain and swelling have been controlled, the patient enters a rehabilitation program that includes exercises to restore the range of motion of <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> strengthen the muscles to prevent future dislocations. These exercises may progress from simple motion to the use of weights.|$|E
25|$|Enlisted grades wear rank {{insignia}} on the sleeve, {{halfway between}} <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> the elbow.
