60|$|All was now ready: {{the cranes}} swung in, the {{lashings}} adrift, {{and the boat}} fairly suspended; when, seizing {{the ends of the}} <b>tackle</b> <b>ropes,</b> we silently stepped into it, one at each end. The dead weight of the breaker astern now dragged the craft horizontally through the air, so that her <b>tackle</b> <b>ropes</b> strained hard. She quivered like a dolphin. Nevertheless, had we not feared her loud splash upon striking the wave, we might have quitted the ship almost as silently as the breath the body. But this was out of the question, and our plans were laid accordingly.|$|R

5000|$|Monamy {{continued}} as the marine painter most esteemed by active serving seamen, even during his slow financial decline {{and loss of}} aristocratic patronage, and for many decades after his death. In 1749 George Vertue expressed this reputation: [...] "his industry and understanding in the forms and buildings of shipping with all the <b>tackles</b> <b>ropes</b> & sails &c which he thoroughly understood made his paintings of greater value; besides his neatness and clean pencilling of sky and water by many was much esteemed, especially sea-faring people, officers & others, merchants &c." [...] Joseph Highmore noted, in 1766, that [...] "A sailor … is a better judge of the principal circumstances which enter into the composition of a sea-piece, than the best painter in the world, who was never at sea." ...|$|R
500|$|Although a {{technical}} analysis {{has shown that}} the transport of triremes (25 t, [...] long, [...] beam), albeit difficult, was technically feasible, it is assumed that the vessels were usually smaller boats rather than ships. To avoid damaging the keel during transport, hypozomata, thick ropes running from bow to stern, to reduce sagging and hogging of the hull, must have been used. Ship and cargo were presumably pulled by men and animals with <b>ropes,</b> <b>tackles</b> and possibly also capstans.|$|R
6000|$|Billings, having {{arrived at}} a decision, lost no time in acting, {{with the result that}} before mid-afternoon we had landed all the large boxes marked [...] "H" [...] upon the beach, and were busily engaged in opening them. Two days later the plane was {{assembled}} and tuned. We loaded <b>tackles</b> and <b>ropes,</b> water, food and ammunition in it, and then we each implored Billings to let us be the one to accompany him. But he would take no one. That was Billings; if there was any especially difficult or dangerous work to be done, that one man could do, Billings always did it himself. If he needed assistance, he never called for volunteers--just selected the man or men he considered best qualified for the duty. He said that he considered the principles underlying all volunteer service fundamentally wrong, and that {{it seemed to him that}} calling for volunteers reflected upon the courage and loyalty of the entire command.|$|R
6000|$|... "My third plan {{seems to}} me the most feasible. You all saw a number of large, heavy boxes lowered into the hold before we sailed. I know you did, because you asked me what they {{contained}} and commented upon the large letter 'H' which was painted upon each box. These boxes contain the various parts of a hydro-aeroplane. I purpose assembling this upon the strip of beach described in Bowen's manuscript--the beach where he found the dead body of the apelike man--provided there is sufficient space above high water; otherwise we shall have to assemble it on deck and lower it over the side. After it is assembled, I shall carry <b>tackle</b> and <b>ropes</b> to the cliff-top, and then it will be comparatively simple to hoist the search-party and its supplies in safety. Or I can make a sufficient number of trips to land the entire party in the valley beyond the barrier; all will depend, of course, upon what my first reconnaissance reveals." ...|$|R
5000|$|Along Confederate Gulch and on Cement Gulch {{the gold}} claims were rich, but they demanded {{a great deal}} of labor. There were large {{boulders}} mixed with gravel along the gulch bottoms. These boulders had to be moved. Cold water would flood the shafts and trenches. [...] The hillside shelves, like Montana Bar and Diamond Bar were easier to mine, but even some of the hillside shelves had technical problems. Along the various Boulder Bars, the large boulders that littered the surface had to be drilled and blasted, or lifted and moved by <b>rope</b> <b>tackle.</b> These were dangerous projects.|$|R
50|$|While a pitch {{refers to}} a drop that can be descended, the term Aven is {{used to refer to}} a pitch when {{discovered}} from below. If not free-climbable, avens can be ascended by means of a bolt climb, where a caver places an ascending series of bolts in the walls and gradually ascends to the top. A rope can then be rigged to the bottom allowing following cavers to pass the obstacle. Some avens have been <b>tackled</b> by lifting <b>ropes</b> or ladders using long poles (Maypoling). Narrow avens can be climbed by pushing against opposite walls (Chimneying).|$|R
2500|$|Chinese rudders {{were not}} {{supported}} by pintle-and-gudgeon as in the Western tradition; rather, they were attached to the hull by means of wooden jaws or sockets, while typically larger ones were suspended from above by a <b>rope</b> <b>tackle</b> system {{so that they could}} be raised or lowered into the water. Also, many junks incorporated [...] "fenestrated rudders" [...] (rudders with holes in them, supposedly allowing for better control). Detailed descriptions of Chinese junks during the Middle Ages are known from various travellers to China, such as Ibn Battuta of Tangier, Morocco and Marco Polo of Venice, Italy. The later Chinese encyclopedist Song Yingxing (1587–1666) and the 17th-century European traveler Louis Lecomte wrote of the junk design and its use of the rudder with enthusiasm and admiration.|$|R
5000|$|Therefore {{when she}} was sent unto by divers letters, both from Antonius himself and also from his friends, she made so light of it and mocked Antonius {{so much that she}} disdained to set forward {{otherwise}} but to take her barge in the river of Cydnus, the poop whereof was of gold, the sails of purple, and the oars of silver, which kept stroke in rowing after the sound of the music of flutes, howboys, cithernes, viols, and such other instruments as they played upon in the barge. And now for the person of herself: she was laid under a pavilion of cloth of gold of tissue, apparelled and attired like the goddess Venus commonly drawn in picture; and hard by her, on either hand of her, pretty fair boys apparelled as painters do set forth god Cupid, with little fans in their hands, with the which they fanned wind upon her. Her ladies and gentlewomen also, the fairest of them were apparelled like the nymphs Nereides (which are the mermaids of the waters) and like the Graces, some steering the helm, others tending the <b>tackle</b> and <b>ropes</b> of the barge, out of which there came a wonderful passing sweet savour of perfumes, that perfumed the wharf's side, pestered with innumerable multitudes of people. Plutarch, Life of Anthony, translated by Sir Thomas North ...|$|R
50|$|As {{an ideal}} example, using a block and <b>tackle</b> with six <b>ropes</b> and a 600 pound load, the {{operator}} {{would be required}} to pull the rope six feet and exert 100 pounds of force to lift the load one foot. Both the ratios Fout / Fin and Vin / Vout from below show that the IMA is six. For the first ratio, 100 pounds of force in results in 600 pounds of force out; in the real world, the force out would be less than 600 pounds. The second ratio also yields a MA of 6 in the ideal case but fails in real world calculations; it does not properly account for energy losses. Subtracting those losses from the IMA or using the first ratio yields the AMA. The ratio of AMA to IMA is the mechanical efficiency of the system.|$|R
500|$|On land {{a minimum}} crew of nine men (usually {{commanded}} by a non-commissioned officer) {{was required to}} fire the gun, which was normally mounted on a traversing gun carriage. On board a ship the gun crew could be doubled to 18 men who needed to traverse the gun carriage by hand, using hand spikes and <b>rope</b> <b>tackles.</b> The extra crew was {{on account of the}} fact that sailing ships usually only fired their cannon {{from one side of the}} deck. [...] In the unlikely event of both sides being in action at once, nine men would be detached to man the gun opposite. In both cases the gun was elevated using wooden wedges driven under the breech of the barrel by brute force. It was aimed using an advanced hexagonal sighting mechanism marked with the elevation on one face and the gun's range (according to different weights of cartridge charges) on the other five faces.|$|R
5000|$|According to Alasdair Pinkerton, {{an expert}} in human {{geography}} at the Royal Holloway University of London, the term is first mentioned in Domesday Book in the 11th century to describe parcels of land that were just beyond the London city walls. The Oxford English Dictionary contains {{a reference to the}} term dating back to 1320, and spelled nonesmanneslond, when the term was used to describe a disputed territory or one over which there was legal disagreement. The same term was later used as the name for the piece of land outside the north wall of London that was assigned as the place of execution. The term was applied to a little-used area on ships called the forecastle, a place where various <b>ropes,</b> <b>tackle,</b> block, and other supplies were stored. In the United Kingdom several places called No Man's Land denoted [...] "extra-parochial spaces that were beyond the rule of the church, beyond the rule of different fiefdoms that were handed out by the king … ribbons of land between these different regimes of power".|$|R
5000|$|On various dates Lieutenant Eastman, with Captain R. L. J. Jones, R.A.O.C., {{worked under}} {{dangerous}} and trying conditions and performed acts of considerable gallantry {{in dealing with}} large numbers of various unexploded bombs, some of which were in a highly dangerous state and of the German delay type.On one occasion, these officers showed particular gallantry in dealing with an 1100lb. German bomb. Two attempts were made to explode this bomb but it failed to detonate; at the third attempt when it was in a most dangerous state, they succeeded in detonating it.On a second occasion, these officers, assisted by a Master Rigger of H.M. Dockyard, succeeded in removing a 400lb. high explosive Italian unexploded bomb which had been under water for a week in a 20ft. deep well inside a house. This bomb, fused at both ends, was in a dangerous state. It had to be raised to the ground floor by means of a gin, <b>tackle,</b> sling and <b>ropes.</b> This operation was doubly dangerous, as: (a) There was a possibility of the sling slipping while the bomb was being hauled up and (b) The bomb was two and half ft. long, the mouth of the well three ft. one inch wide, and for safety the bomb had to be kept horizontal, if possible, and pulled up thus. Lieutenant Eastman assisted the Master Rigger, guided the bomb from the floor of the well, and Captain Jones went to the top to guide it through the opening. They succeeded in getting the bomb out although there was only a six inch clearance as it came through the mouth of the well. London Gazette ...|$|R
60|$|Technical {{instruction}} tempts {{to violence}} (as a short cut) more than liberal education. The sailor in Mr Rudyard Kipling's Captains Courageous, teaching the boy {{the names of}} the ship's <b>tackle</b> with a <b>rope's</b> end, does not disgust us as our schoolmasters do, especially as the boy was a spoiled boy. But an unspoiled boy would not have needed that drastic medicine. Technical training may be as tedious as learning to skate or to play the piano or violin; but it is the price one must pay to achieve certain desirable results or necessary ends. It is a monstrous thing to force a child to learn Latin or Greek or mathematics on the ground that they are an indispensable gymnastic for the mental powers. It would be monstrous even if it were true; for there is no labor that might not be imposed on a child or an adult on the same pretext; but as a glance at the average products of our public school and university education shews that it is not true, it need not trouble us. But {{it is a fact that}} ignorance of Latin and Greek and mathematics closes certain careers to men (I do not mean artificial, unnecessary, noxious careers like those of the commercial schoolmaster). Languages, even dead ones, have their uses; and, as it seems to many of us, mathematics have their uses. They will always be learned by people who want to learn them; and people will always want to learn them as long as they are of any importance in life: indeed the want will survive their importance: superstition is nowhere stronger than in the field of obsolete acquirements. And they will never be learnt fruitfully by people who do not want to learn them either for their own sake or for use in necessary work. There is no harder schoolmaster than experience; and yet experience fails to teach where there is no desire to learn.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ship the}} English saw pass before {{the town was}} not French, but rather a shallop from the Sparrow, a {{shipping}} vessel sponsored by Thomas Weston and one other of the Plymouth settlement's sponsors, which was plying the eastern fishing grounds. This boat brought seven additional settlers but no provisions whatsoever [...] "nor any hope of any." [...] In a letter they brought, Weston explained that the settlers were {{to set up a}} salt pan operation on one of the islands in the harbor for the private account of Weston. He asked the Plymouth colony, however, to house and feed these newcomers, provide them with seed stock and (ironically) salt, until he was able to send the salt pan to them. The Plymouth settlers had spent the winter and spring on half rations in order to feed the settlers that had been sent nine months ago without provisions. Now Weston was exhorting them to support new settlers who were not even sent to help the plantation. He also announced that he would be sending another ship that would discharge more passengers before it would sail on to Virginia. He requested that the settlers entertain them in their houses so that they could go out and cut down timber to lade the ship quickly so as not to delay its departure. Bradford found the whole business [...] "but cold comfort to fill their hungry bellies." [...] Bradford was not exaggerating. Winslow described the dire straits. They now were without bread [...] "the want whereof much abated the strength and the flesh of some, and swelled others." [...] Without hooks or seines or netting, they could not collect the bass in the rivers and cove, and without <b>tackle</b> and navigation <b>rope,</b> they could not fish for the abundant cod in the sea. Had it not been for shellfish which they could catch by hand, they would have perished. But there was more, Weston also informed them that the London backers had decided to dissolve the venture. Weston urged the settlers to ratify the decision; only then might the London merchants send them further support, although what motivation they would then have he did not explain. That boat also, evidently, contained alarming news from the South. John Huddleston, who was unknown to them but captained a fishing ship that had returned from Virginia to the Maine fishing grounds, advised his [...] "good friends at Plymouth" [...] of the massacre in the Jamestown settlements by the Powhatan in which he said 400 had been killed. He warned them: [...] "Happy is he whom other men's harms doth make to beware." [...] This last communication Bradford decided to turn to their advantage. Sending a return for this kindness, they might also seek fish or other provisions from the fishermen. Winslow and a crew were selected to make the voyage to Maine, 150 miles away, to a place they had never been. In Winslow's reckoning, he left at the end of May for Damariscove. Winslow found the fishermen more than sympathetic and they freely gave what they could. Even though this was not as much as Winslow hoped, it was enough to keep them going until the harvest.|$|R
