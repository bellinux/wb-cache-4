5|$|After being spotted, the German {{ships in}} Førde Fjord sailed further up the fjord and {{prepared}} for an Allied attack. Z33 and several of her escorts anchored close to <b>the</b> <b>steep</b> southern slopes of the fjord {{near the village of}} Bjørkedal. Meanwhile, other ships moored near the northern shore after breaking up pack ice with gunfire. This anchorage was also protected by flak batteries on the shore of the fjord.|$|E

The only difference is that the converging algorithm is repeated using Newton's method instead of <b>the</b> <b>steepest</b> descent method. Thus, the frequency parameters are estimated to a high degree of accuracy and at high speed by using a hybrid process combining <b>the</b> <b>steepest</b> descent and Newton's method.|$|R
5|$|Before {{settlers}} arrived, {{the land}} that became known as Forest Park was covered by a Douglas-fir forest. By 1851, its acreage had been divided into donation land claims filed by settlers with plans to clear the forest and build upon the property. After logging, <b>the</b> <b>steep</b> slopes and unstable silt loosened by heavy rains caused landslides that defeated construction plans, and claims were defaulted or donated to the city.|$|E
5|$|Both the Mont Blanc massif, and the Aiguilles Rouges {{range to}} its north, now {{form part of}} the {{external}} zone of the Alps, effectively being the outermost layers of rock. The central granites make up Mont Blanc, <b>the</b> <b>steep</b> slopes of the Drus, the Grandes Jorasses and the Dent du Géant, and at the highest points are topped by schists, which are visible {{in places such as}} Grands Montets and near Mont Blanc's summit.|$|E
5|$|Helvellyn is {{a popular}} area for winter {{climbing}} in the Lake District. <b>The</b> <b>steep</b> headwall above Red Tarn contains several graded routes, clustered around the prow-shaped buttress {{on the right-hand side}} of the face, known to climbers as Viking Buttress, and in a couple of gullies which lead to the summit.|$|E
50|$|The {{higher the}} order of a valley, <b>the</b> <b>steeper</b> usually are <b>the</b> hillsides resp. valley slopes. Looking upstream, <b>the</b> <b>steepest</b> slopes are {{normally}} near the source of a brook (with the exception of very hard rocks in downstream direction).|$|R
50|$|The gentler slopes to {{the east}} and north are settled, while <b>the</b> <b>steeper</b> slopes to <b>the</b> west and south are free of buildings. <b>The</b> <b>steepest</b> slope is to the south, where it reaches the sea within a {{distance}} of 400 meters.|$|R

5|$|In 1878, {{as part of}} {{the review}} of the defences of Singapore against threats from European powers in the region, it was decided that forts be built {{on either side of the}} {{entrance}} to New Harbour. Fort Pasir Panjang was built on Labrador and Fort Siloso on Pulau Blakang Mati (now Sentosa). It was found that <b>the</b> <b>steep</b> cliffs and thick mangrove swamps surrounding the two forts acted as an ideal natural barrier to intruders.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, the Mérens was {{introduced}} to the island of Réunion, where its breeding is now part of the local economy. It is used as a saddle horse and for hauling. The breed is also used for equestrian tourism on the mountains of the island, where it is particularly well suited for <b>the</b> <b>steep</b> terrain and climate, taking tourists into volcanic regions covered in ash.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} vicinity of the building is the Palace of Holyroodhouse, which is bordered by the broad expanse of Holyrood Park. To {{the south of the}} parliamentary complex are <b>the</b> <b>steep</b> slopes of Salisbury Crags and Arthur's Seat.

50|$|Steepest descent. Although a {{reduction}} in the sum of squares is guaranteed when the shift vector points in <b>the</b> direction of <b>steepest</b> descent, this method often performs poorly. When the parameter values are far from optimal the direction of <b>the</b> <b>steepest</b> descent vector, which is normal (perpendicular) to the contours of the objective function, {{is very different from the}} direction of the Gauss-Newton vector. This makes divergence much more likely, especially as the minimum along <b>the</b> direction of <b>steepest</b> descent may correspond to a small fraction of the length of <b>the</b> <b>steepest</b> descent vector. When the contours of the objective function are very eccentric, due to there being high correlation between parameters, <b>the</b> <b>steepest</b> descent iterations, with shift-cutting, follow a slow, zig-zag trajectory towards the minimum.|$|R
5|$|Industry {{declined}} {{after the}} Second World War and subsequent land reclamation and new housing developments {{have changed the}} face of the town, but its centre retains the atmosphere of a bustling market town, with a refurbished market square. <b>The</b> <b>steep</b> terraces branching off the main streets give the town a distinctive character.|$|E
5|$|Nordberg Station {{was located}} in <b>the</b> <b>steep</b> road named Borgestadveien, that passed the station in a level crossing. The station served the local senior center named Nordberghjemmet, and was the most used of all {{stations}} among residents living in Nordberg. After the 1992 closure, very little remains from the station, aside from a pedestrians' underpass.|$|E
5|$|Nordberg was {{a station}} on the Sognsvann Line of the Oslo Metro in Oslo, Norway. It was opened on 10 October 1934, and was located between Østhorn and Holstein stations, in a level {{crossing}} with <b>the</b> <b>steep</b> road Borgestadveien. The station saw several accidents, and was closed on 5 May 1992 when the Sognsvann Line was upgraded to rapid transit standard. An underpass was constructed to allow pedestrians pass under the tracks.|$|E

5|$|The English {{county of}} Buckinghamshire is {{bisected}} by the Chiltern Hills, which rise sharply and cross the county from northeast to southwest. Although the fertile soil and good drainage of the Chilterns provides ideal conditions for farming, <b>the</b> <b>steep</b> hills historically made travelling difficult. Few sizeable settlements developed in Buckinghamshire, and what roads existed were of poor quality.|$|E
5|$|The Precambrian gneiss and schist {{that make}} up the {{majority}} of <b>the</b> <b>steep</b> walls of the Black Canyon formed 1.7 billion years ago during a metamorphic period brought on by the collision of ancient volcanic island arcs with the southern end of what is present-day Wyoming. The lighter-colored pegmatite dikes that can be seen crosscutting the basement rocks formed later during this same period.|$|E
5|$|The basement, and {{for part}} of the home's history, the main living area, is {{accessed}} via a staircase {{at the back of the}} first-floor hall. <b>The</b> <b>steep</b> stairs still show years of wear.

5|$|The pass {{is above}} tree line, so the {{surrounding}} terrain is alpine tundra. Open grassy expanses are occasionally broken by low shrubbery and bare patches of rock, particularly on <b>the</b> <b>steep</b> slope to the north. Snow lingers {{in some areas}} year-round. Adjacent to the road and parking area are small ephemeral pools on the southwest, with a larger, permanent one north of the road.|$|E
5|$|The {{region of}} West Virginia {{through which the}} freeway passes is rural and mountainous.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>steep</b> {{walls of}} the gorge support some rare fauna and flora, {{including}} species unique to the gorge. There are a total of 24 rare plant species and two unique trees: the Bristol and Wilmotts's whitebeams. Other notable plants include Bristol rock cress, Bristol onion, spiked speedwell, autumn squill and honewort. Because of its steep sides, there are {{many parts of the}} gorge on which trees cannot grow, making way for smaller plants. The gorge is also home to rare invertebrate species. The gorge has a microclimate around 1 degree warmer than the surrounding land. <b>The</b> <b>steep</b> south-west facing sides receive the afternoon sunlight, but are partially sheltered from the prevailing winds. When winds come from the Bristol Channel in the north west they may be funnelled into the gorge, creating harsh and wet conditions.|$|E
50|$|Rack-and-adhesion systems use the cog drive only on <b>the</b> <b>steepest</b> {{sections}} and elsewhere {{operate as a}} regular railway. Others, <b>the</b> <b>steeper</b> ones, are rack-only. On the latter type, the locomotives' wheels are generally free-wheeling and despite appearances do not contribute to driving the train. In this case the racks continue also in the horizontal parts, if any.|$|R
