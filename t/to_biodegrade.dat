40|$|Abstract: The Properties {{of natural}} shear {{strength}} for {{municipal solid waste}} are studied by applying a new developed direct shear testing instrument. The municipal solid waste {{is divided into three}} parts: incompressible solid waste, reinforced material that is difficult <b>to</b> be <b>biodegraded</b> and the material that is easy <b>to</b> be <b>biodegraded.</b> The properties of these three parts are 15 %, 5 % and 80 %, respectively. A series of laboratory tests have been conducted for different initial void ratio, and different pressure applied on the test specimen. The testing results show that the initial void ratio is a key factor for the natural shear strength of the municipal solid waste, the relationship between the shear stress and the shear strain is a strain hardening curve, the shear stress gradually increases with the shear strain. Besides, the natural shear strength shows a linear relationship to the pressure applied on the test specimen, and it is in accordance with the law of coulomb. According to the fitted lines, the shear strength parameters are obtained. The cohesion varies from 4. 7 to 12. 6 kPa, and the internal friction angle varies from 14. 5 to 18. 3 degree for the shear strain is equal to 5 %. When the shear strain is equal to 20 %, the cohesion varies from 8. 5 to 17. 2 kPa, and the internal friction angle varies from 25. 5 to 30. 7 degree...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDuring {{the past}} two decades, the {{diagnosis}} and monitoring of polluted sites have become more important. Urban sites are particularly difficult to study, because they are contaminated with various pollutants, {{and there is a}} large physical and chemical heterogeneity. The heterogeneity comes from the landfilling of various solid wastes and remolded soil (endogenous or exogenous) from which they were constituted over time. Traditional techniques such as wells monitoring, are often insufficient to evaluate the extension of soil contamination. This is why we proposed a geoelectrical methodology from the fastest to the most information rich technique, showing all carry out and acquisition times: electromagnetic low frequency conductivity mapping, electrical resistivity profiles, chargeability profiles and spectral induced polarization (SIP) soundings. This strategy has been successfully applied to an urban site located in the Paris Basin (France). A conductivity map in relation with geochemical and lithological informations should provide us information to implement electrical resistivity and chargeability profiles. The latter allowed us to differentiate 3 main anomaly zones that have been determined. As interpretation of chargeability profiles is difficult, because it integrates polarization mechanisms with different relaxation times, we add spectral induced polarization soundings that provide us information concerning the contaminant nature. We determined the extension of an organic phase, and of 2 highly mineralized zones that could be linked <b>to</b> <b>biodegraded</b> and/or with pyrite areas. That theory is consistent with groundwater analysis and SIP data. The conclusion is that the suggested methodology is well suited to the study of urban contaminated sites including several different pollutants...|$|R
