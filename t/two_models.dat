5|$|Brazilian flex {{cars are}} capable of running on just {{hydrated}} ethanol (E100), or just on a blend of gasoline with 20 to 25%anhydrous ethanol, or on any arbitrary combination of both fuels. Pure gasoline is no longer sold in the country because these high ethanol blends are mandatory since 1993. Therefore, all Brazilian automakers have optimized flex vehicles to run with gasoline blends from E20 to E25, so these FFVs are unable to run smoothly with pure gasoline {{with the exception of}} <b>two</b> <b>models</b> are specifically built with a flex-fuel engine optimized to operate also with pure gasoline (E0), the Renault Clio Hi-Flex and the Fiat Siena Tetrafuel.|$|E
5|$|Despite the controversy, {{the first}} E85 {{flexible}} fuel vehicles {{were introduced in}} November 2008. The first <b>two</b> <b>models</b> available in the Thai market were the Volvo S80 and the C30. The S80 is manufactured locally and the C30 is imported. By {{the time of the}} introduction of flex vehicles there were already two gas stations with E85 fuel available. During 2009 it was expected that 15 fueling stations in Bangkok will have E85 fuel available. In October 2009 the Mitsubishi Lancer Ex was launched becoming the first mass-production E85 flexi-fuel vehicle produced in Thailand.|$|E

5|$|Fender {{was bought}} by CBS in 1965. Rhodes stayed with the company, and {{released}} the first Fender Rhodes piano, a 73 note model. The instrument consisted of two components— the piano and a separate enclosure containing the power amplifier and loudspeaker, which was placed underneath the former. Like the piano bass, it was finished in black tolex, and came with a fiberglass top. During the late 1960s, <b>two</b> <b>models</b> of the Fender Rhodes Celeste also became available, which used the top three or four octaves, respectively, of the Fender Rhodes piano. The Celeste did not sell particularly well and examples are now hard to find.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 581d orbits Gliese 581 at 0.21847 AU, {{approximately}} {{a fifth of}} the distance that the Earth orbits the Sun, though its orbital eccentricity has not been confirmed. There are currently <b>two</b> <b>models</b> for its orbit, a circular one like Earth's, and an eccentric one like Mercury's. These are based on the four planet and six planet model for the Gliese 581 system, respectively. Under the four planet model Gliese 581d would most probably be in a spin-orbit resonance of 2:1, rotating twice for each orbit of its parent star. Therefore, the day on Gliese 581d should approximately be 67 Earth days long.|$|E

5|$|T-26 model 1931 with gun plus {{machine gun}} armament: twin-turreted version with a 37mm {{gun in the}} right turret (some modern sources mention this tank as T-26 model 1932). There were <b>two</b> <b>models</b> of 37mm guns in the USSR {{suitable}} for mounting in light tanks at that time—the Hotchkiss gun (or its Soviet improved variant PS-1), and the more powerful PS-2 gun developed by P. Syachentov. The latter was superior, but only experimental models existed. Therefore, the first 10 pre-production T-26s, which had a design identical to the Vickers 6-Ton, were equipped with a Hotchkiss gun in the right turret to increase firepower compared to the machine gun armed Vickers tank. The experimental PS-2 gun was mounted on only three T-26 tanks, the right turrets of which were replaced with small gun turrets from the T-35-1 (prototype of the T-35 heavy tank).|$|E
5|$|The iPhone 5S and 5C {{sold over}} nine million {{units in the}} first three days, setting a record for first weekend {{smartphone}} sales, with the 5S selling three times more units than the 5C. After the first day of release, 1% of all iPhones in the US were iPhone 5Ss, while 0.3% were iPhone 5Cs. Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray reported that the line at the Fifth Avenue Apple Store contained 1,417 people on release day, compared to 1,300 for the iPhone 4 in 2010, and 549 for the iPhone 3G in 2008 on their respective release days.

5|$|Subsequently, {{wind shear}} increased, {{caused by the}} outflow of {{powerful}} Hurricane John to its east. Additionally, the hurricane moved into an area of cooler water temperatures, {{and as a result}} its appearance became ragged and amorphous. At the same time, steering currents weakened, and the future of Kristy was uncertain; the NHC forecast the hurricane to continue slowly westward, dissipating within four days. However, other hurricane models suggested a motion to the southwest, and <b>two</b> <b>models</b> predicted a Fujiwhara effect, or an orbiting of two tropical cyclones, which would eventually result in Kristy being absorbed by Hurricane John. On September1, Kristy weakened to tropical storm status, and it weakened faster as dry air encroached the storm. It turned southeastward as the ridge to its north strengthened. On September2, the circulation became exposed from the convection, and it was forecast to degenerate into a remnant low within 24hours. Later that day, Kristy weakened to tropical depression status.|$|E

Based on the correspondence of these <b>two</b> <b>models,</b> we can also say that hierarchical is a mixture modal of non-hierarchical model.|$|E
