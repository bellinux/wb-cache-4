In these nations, equalising <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> will support higher levels of fertility. In higher income developing nations, the opposite will hold and the association between income inequality and fertility is positive. In these nations, equalising <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> will support lower levels of fertility. With respect to mortality it is argued that {{the relationship between}} income inequality and mortality is positive.
