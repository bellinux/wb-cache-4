However, boards in small firms are now undergoing major changes. In this paper we test hypotheses of what makes boards active and allows them to contribute to value creation.

Predictions based on agency theory, resource dependence theory and the resource based view of the firm are used <b>to</b> explore <b>board</b> task involvement. In a sample of 347 small firms we got strong support for hypotheses highlighting {{the use of the}} knowledge of the board members and various board maintenance tools, such as regular <b>board</b> evaluations, <b>to</b> increase <b>board</b> task involvement. Various contextual variables were included as control variables, but few were significantly related <b>to</b> <b>board</b> task involvement.

5|$|Born into a wealthy, anglicized Indian family, Devika Rani {{was sent}} <b>to</b> <b>boarding</b> school in England at age nine {{and grew up}} in that country. In 1928, she met Himanshu Rai, an Indian film-producer, and married him the {{following}} year. She assisted in costume design and art direction for Rai's experimental silent film A Throw of Dice (1929). Both of them then went to Germany and received training in film-making at UFA Studios in Berlin. Rai then cast himself as hero and her as heroine in his next production, the bilingual film Karma (1933), made simultaneously in English & Hindi. The film premiered in England in 1933, elicited interest there for a prolonged kissing scene featuring the real-life couple, and flopped badly in India. The couple returned to India in 1934, where Himanshu Rai established a production studio, Bombay Talkies, in partnership with certain other people. The studio produced several successful films over the next 5-6 years, and Devika Rani played the lead role in many of them. Her on-screen pairing with Ashok Kumar became popular in India.|$|E

5|$|In 1829, {{at the age}} of 15, Colt {{began working}} in his father's textile plant in Ware, Massachusetts, where he had access to tools, materials, and the factory workers' expertise. Following the encyclopedia, Samuel built a {{homemade}} galvanic cell and advertised as a Fourth of July event in that year that he would blow up a raft on Ware Pond using underwater explosives; although the raft was missed, the explosion was still impressive. Sent <b>to</b> <b>boarding</b> school, he amused his classmates with pyrotechnics. In 1830, a July 4 accident caused a fire that ended his schooling, and his father sent him off to learn the seaman's trade. On a voyage to Calcutta on board the brig Corvo, he noticed that regardless of which way the ship's wheel was spun, each spoke always came in direct line with a clutch that could be set to hold it. He later said that this gave him the idea for the revolver. On the Corvo, Colt made a wooden model of a pepperbox revolver out of scrap wood. It differed from other pepperbox revolvers at the time in that it would allow the shooter to rotate the cylinder by the action of cocking the hammer with an attached pawl turning the cylinder which is then locked firmly in alignment with one of the barrels by a bolt, a great improvement over the pepperbox designs which required rotating the barrels by hand and hoping for proper indexing and alignment.|$|E
