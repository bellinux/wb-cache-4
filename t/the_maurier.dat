50|$|The James C. Olin Flood Control Project was {{completed}} in 1997 to reduce the potential for damage from flooding of <b>the</b> <b>Maury</b> River and inland streams in Buena Vista.|$|R
50|$|Buena Vista is {{situated}} {{on the east side}} of <b>the</b> <b>Maury</b> River at <b>the</b> western foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains. <b>The</b> <b>Maury</b> has a history of destructive floods damaging nearby communities. Particularly notable were floods on Oct 12, 1870, on the death of Robert E. Lee, when <b>the</b> <b>Maury</b> River provided Lee a temporary coffin due to a dock washed away up river (source: Library Virginia Military Institute), and in 1936, 1969, 1985 and 1995. The Flood of '69 was the result of rainfall from the inland movement of Hurricane Camille. The Flood of '85 resulted from the convergence of three systems, including Hurricane Juan, which dumped tremendous amounts of rain on western Virginia. The flood of record for <b>the</b> lower <b>Maury</b> River (downstream of the confluence with the South River), including Buena Vista and Glasgow, occurred on August 20, 1969, at a stage of 31.23 ft on the Buena Vista gauge. (Flooding begins at 17.0 ft and major flooding at 21.0 ft.) The downtowns of Buena Vista and Glasgow were submerged in over 5 ft of water. <b>The</b> upper <b>Maury</b> River including Lexington saw its flood of record during the Flood of 1985 when the gauging station at Rockbridge Baths recorded a value of 19.19 ft from flood marks. The difference in flooding results from differing contributions of the South River depending on rainfall in the respective watersheds.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Maury</b> Channel is a deep-sea {{sediment}} transport system {{located in the}} Iceland Basin and extends from the Icelandic plateau southwards towards the Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone (CGFZ). This study has utilised multibeam bathymetry and multi-channel seismic reflection survey data along 480 km of its 1200 km pathway. In the northern reach of the channel it is predominantly broad (> 20 km) and shallow (10 m). Further to the south the channel narrows (5 – 10 km) and locally deepens to 150 m prior to finally discharging onto the Eriador Plain {{to the north of}} the CGFZ. DSDP Site 115 in the Iceland Basin can provide insight into the evolution of the system as it sampled a suite of volcaniclastic turbidites of unequivocal Icelandic provenance. This sequence produces distinct amplitude anomalies on seismic reflection profiles allowing it to be mapped over an area of at least 26, 000 km 2. The southern edge of the high velocity unit is delimited by onlap onto the flanks of the Miocene (and younger) Gardar Drift. The drift appears to have initially acted as a barrier to southerly flows and promoted ponding of flows in <b>the</b> <b>Maury</b> Fan. Continued sediment supply from Iceland eventually filled <b>the</b> <b>Maury</b> Fan leading to the overspilling of the Gardar Drift dam. A result was the initiation of <b>the</b> <b>Maury</b> Channel. To <b>the</b> south of the drift, where the seabed is steep, flows are confined to the channel, whereas {{to the north of the}} drift, where the gradient is less, unconfined flow pathways dominate. <b>The</b> <b>Maury</b> Channel system highlights the interaction between turbidity currents and bottom currents on abyssal plains. The growth of sediment drifts not only mould the seafloor through their bathymetric development but also, through the building of seafloor topography, influence the passage and behaviour of gravity-driven sediment-laden flows along the seafloor. <br/...|$|R
