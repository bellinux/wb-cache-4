The team stayed in a bleak hotel and it rained endlessly. I just wanted to get back home. With {{hindsight}} you think, 'Why the bloody hell was I playing?' Very soon afterwards, Francesca died. She was sleeping between us. I realised what was happening and woke Susan. We cradled Francesca and cried." ...|$|E
500|$|Late {{at night}} on July 28, 1962, Costa {{was killed in a}} car crash, {{involving}} no other vehicles, on New York's Westside Highway at 72nd Street. He was survived by his wife and four children. This loss to music was summarized years later in the liner notes to one of his recordings: [...] "No pianist with his combination of strength, humor, and drive has developed in the sixties or seventies, and as the years go by it becomes more apparent <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> a unique creative musician". In his eight-year recording career, Costa appeared on more than 100 albums. He never recorded a solo album.|$|E
500|$|Strong {{support in}} Montreal, and the {{response}} in Ottawa after the games were moved to the national capital left Eagleson increasingly confident in the tournament's future. The 1981 Canada Cup turned a profit of about C$1 million to be split between Hockey Canada and the National Hockey League Players Association pension fund, one third that of the 1976 tournament. Shortly after the tournament ended, Eagleson confirmed he intended to hold a third Canada Cup. [...] He noted that Canada's loss in the final {{played a role in}} his decision: [...] "As far as I am concerned personally, it's probably preferable <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>lost.</b> [...] I think if we had won, I'd have said, 'To hell with it'." ...|$|E

If you {{can prove}} {{that any of these}} {{promises}} were made to the holiness <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had <b>lost,</b> or <b>that</b> by these promises we are to be possessed with that holiness again; I will even now lay down the bucklers. For albeit, the time will come when the saints shall be absolutely, and perfectly sinless; yet then shall they be also spiritual, immortal, and incorruptible, which you cannot prove Adam was, in the best of his holiness, even <b>that</b> which <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> in him.|$|R

500|$|Championship runner-up Fernando Alonso {{expressed}} {{pride for}} his team, {{going so far}} as to call the 2012 season [...] "the best season of my career". During the podium interview with Nelson Piquet, he asserted: [...] "Obviously we lost the championship now, but I don't think, as you said, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> here in Brazil, we lost in some races where we were a little bit unlucky. But this is a sport, but when you do something with your heart, when you do something with 100 per cent, you have to be proud of your team, happy for them, and we will try next year." [...] The press later pointed out Alonso's [...] "grace after the race", contrasting him to Vettel who had criticized the competition's [...] "dirty tricks" [...] during his post-race press conference.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger {{revealed}} {{before the}} Charity Shield game {{that he was}} not overly concerned with Anelka leaving, rather the injuries that were depleting his squad: [...] "I cannot forget that it was because of a poor start to last season <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> the championship to Manchester United." [...] He refused to categorise the match as a [...] "friendly" [...] much like it is traditionally viewed as: [...] "There is a trophy and medals at stake. We won it last season and our players want to win it again." [...] Ferguson described the 3–0 defeat in the previous season's Shield as a [...] "humiliation", before discussing how it made the team prepare for the challenges ahead: [...] "I have reminded the players {{how hard it is to}} lose when you are playing for United these days – it makes so many other people happy." [...] Indeed, United only lost five matches of the whole of last season, with their last defeat coming at home to Middlesbrough in December 1998.|$|E
2500|$|Al-Ahly {{qualified}} for 2005 FIFA Club World Championship but finished last, Aboutrika told FIFA.com the reason saying: [...] "Our problem was <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> our form, {{for some reason}} we could not play like we had before arriving in Japan".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} visit to North Korea by a senior American {{official}} in over five years, Hill flew into Pyongyang on June 21, 2007 for a two-day visit where he was warmly greeted by Ri Gun, the North's deputy nuclear negotiator at the airport. [...] "We {{want to get the}} six-party process moving", Mr. Hill said. [...] "We hope that we can make up for some of the time <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> this spring, and so I’m looking forward to good discussions about that." [...] The visit had been organized in secrecy. Hill had been visiting Tokyo and flew to South Korea and then on to Pyongyang on a small jet. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice informed regional allies Japan and South Korea just before Hill's departure from Tokyo.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked by}} reporters after the 2011 ALDS {{if he had}} {{considered}} {{that he might have}} played for the final time with the Yankees, Posada said, [...] "I don't {{want to look at it}} like <b>that.</b> <b>We</b> <b>lost,</b> and we'll see what happens in the off-season." [...] As the interview session went on, he eventually became emotional and left the clubhouse area to compose himself. Girardi said, [...] "This guy, when you look at what he did in this series, he was awesome. He's had a tremendous career, and I'm sure he's going to continue to play, and I don't know what's going to happen." [...] Girardi added, [...] "But you talk about being proud of players — what he went through this year and what he gave us in the postseason, I don't think there's a prouder moment that I've had of Jorge." ...|$|E
2500|$|It's {{not really}} revenge, I think, if anything, it's redemption. But it's more about us, it's {{not so much}} about Tennessee. We didn't play very well last year when we went there and {{probably}} got caught a little too much focusing on them and the environment and that type of thing. So at practice this year, we're really just focusing on ourselves if we go out and play to our potential then we'll have a chance to be successful. Last year we didn't come close to our potential so we had no chance. Of course it's a big game like it was last year, two ranked teams, so there's a lot of people watching it to see what's going on. It wasn't <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> the game last year, I think it was the way we lost the game last year that was the devastating part of it, that hung with us so long.|$|E

"Our last {{accounts}} {{leave him}} {{safe in the}} court of Louis," [...] returned his companion; [...] "but there are men as desperate as himself, who sail the ocean under the rebel flag, and from one or two of them we have had much reason to apprehend the vengeance of disappointed men. It is they <b>that</b> <b>we</b> hope <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> in this gale." ...|$|R

2500|$|Interviews {{conducted}} by Martin Middlebrook for his book, Argentine Fight For The Falklands, indicated that Argentine naval officers understood {{the intent of}} the message was to indicate that any ships operating near the exclusion zone could be attacked. Argentine Rear Admiral Allara, {{who was in charge of}} the task force of which General Belgrano was part, said, [...] "After that message of 23 April, the entire South Atlantic was an operational theatre for both sides. We, as professionals, said it was just too bad <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> the Belgrano". Captain Bonzo also told Middlebrook that he was not angry about the attack on his ship and [...] "The limit [...] did not exclude danger or risks; it was all the same in or out. I would like to be quite precise that, as far as I was concerned, the 200-mile limit was valid until 1 May, that is while diplomatic negotiations were taking place and/or until a real act of war took place, and that had happened on 1 May".|$|E
2500|$|Dale Earnhardt, Jr. {{took the}} lead from Tony Stewart with four laps to go and held off a hard {{charging}} Jeff Gordon to score his first career win at Martinsville Speedway. “Oh, man, been trying to win here for so many years,” Earnhardt said. “Real emotional win. I can’t believe we won here. We’re going to {{drink a lot of}} beer tonight. It’s a real emotional win. This team on pit road was great and Steve (Letarte, crew chief) and the guys did a real good job all day. They gave me a great shot at it there with the call at the end to take tires. I can’t believe we won here. This means so much to all of us. It’s just real emotional.” [...] "That means so much to Hendrick Motorsports," [...] Gordon said. [...] "That's the best way you can possibly pay tribute to those <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> 10 years ago. To have a 1-2 finish, that's pretty awesome. I {{would have loved to have}} gotten that win to move on to Homestead, but this is certainly a great start for us." [...] "I thought we had the car to beat," [...] Gordon said. [...] "Those last couple of laps were just wild. This means so much to Hendrick Motorsports. It's the best way to pay tribute to everyone we lost 10 years ago. I would have loved to get that win to move on to Homestead. But I'm real happy for Dale. I know this means so much to him." ...|$|E
