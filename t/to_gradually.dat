5|$|By {{early on}} August 27, the {{tropical}} storm became slightly better organized, although {{the most intense}} winds were still removed from the center. Danny peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1006 mbar (hPa; 29.71 inHg). It held this strength for about 12 hours before wind shear caused the storm <b>to</b> <b>gradually</b> weaken as it meandered northward. By August 28, Danny further deteriorated, and reconnaissance aircraft {{found that it was}} barely a tropical storm. After stalling during the afternoon, the center resumed a north or north-northwestward drift.|$|E

A reconnaissance mission around this time recorded a minimum pressure of 970mbar (hPa; 28.64inHg).|$|E

The interaction of this magnetic field and material with Earth's magnetic field funnels charged particles into Earth's upper atmosphere, where its interactions create aurorae seen near the magnetic poles.|$|E

As a result, FANK forces became fragmented, isolated, and unable to lend one another mutual support.|$|E

The third tropical cyclone of the season, Carlotta developed from a tropical wave on June 18 about 270miles (470km) southeast {{off the coast of}} Mexico. With favorable conditions for development, it strengthened steadily at first, followed by a period of rapid deepening to peak winds of 155mph (250km/h) on June 22. Cooler waters caused Carlotta <b>to</b> <b>gradually</b> weaken, and on June 25 it degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure while located about 260miles (420km) west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas.|$|E
