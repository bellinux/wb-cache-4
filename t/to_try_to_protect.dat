5|$|Poisonous {{sausages}} containing toad meat {{are being}} trialled in the Kimberley (Western Australia) <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> native animals from cane toads' deadly impact. The Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation {{has been working}} with the University of Sydney to develop baits to train native animals not to eat the toads. By blending bits of toad with a nausea-inducing chemical, the baits train the animals {{to stay away from the}} amphibians. Researcher David Pearson says trials run in laboratories and in remote parts of the Kimberley region of WA are looking promising, although the baits will not solve the cane toad problem altogether.|$|E

At the beginning, MMLI's role {{was dedicated to}} the examination of aliens working in factories and munitions plants, effectively becoming a secret part of the employment process {{for this kind of}} work. However, by May 1916, there was a radical change in direction for the organisation. After some Labour leaders started to oppose the Munitions of War Act, intelligence shifted from solely finding German agents, <b>to</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> against industrial action too, focusing left on the political spectrum.|$|R

25|$|In June 2006, the Islamic Courts Union {{seized control}} of {{southern}} Somalia, including the country's capital Mogadishu, prompting the Ethiopian government to send in troops <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the transitional government. In December, the Islamic Courts warned Ethiopia they would declare war if Ethiopia did not remove all its troops from Somalia. Sheikh Sharif Ahmed, leader of the Islamic Courts, called for a jihad, or holy war, against Ethiopia and encouraged foreign Muslim fighters to come to Somalia. At that time, the United States accused the group of being controlled by al-Qaeda, but the Islamic Courts denied that charge.|$|E
25|$|The Lenape {{allies of}} the British began {{conducting}} raids on the Pennsylvania frontier soon after {{the outset of the}} American Revolution. An attack at the mouth of Pine Creek in December 1777 and another attack further upstream, near modern Lock Haven, prompted action by Pennsylvania's militia <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the frontiersmen on the West Branch Susquehanna River. Colonel Samuel Hunter ordered Colonel Antes to gather a force of men from the West Branch Valley to gather at Antes' property. The men of the militia built a stockade that was at least 12feet (4m) high around the Antes home. The stockade enclosed approximately three quarters of an acre (3,000 m²). Colonel Antes was forced to defend an extensive frontier that was under steady attack from Native American and Tory forces that were dispatched to Pennsylvania from Fort Niagara on Lake Ontario in New York.|$|E
25|$|People {{possess an}} {{inherent}} ensemble of basic beliefs about themselves, others, the world, etc. Such “naïve theories” are what compose our symbolic universe. One’s symbolic universe {{is part of}} a socially shared knowledge, transmitted principally as a result of education and social communication, with a large emphasis on the process of attachment through which parents impart their visions of the world, their symbolic universes, to their children. Such symbolic universes guide how we make sense of the world, and are composed of a relatively stable network of ideologies. Therefore, if one of these beliefs is compromised, the stability of the entire network could be jeopardized. It is very important for people to maintain a sense of stability within such a system of beliefs, so they have a natural psychological motivation <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> these beliefs. Because such beliefs have a fundamentally social origin, their revalidation can only be legitimized through a social consensus. Along these lines, aforementioned social rituals came {{to be used as a}} more structured way of re-substantiating beliefs that have been invalidated as a result of an emotional event.|$|E

Between daybreak and 14:00, numerous Japanese scout aircraft approached TF18. Although they were all chased away by the CAP, they observed and reported the position of Chicago. At 12:15, a force of 11Type 1 torpedo bombers from the 751 Air Group (751AG), based at Kavieng and staging through Buka, launched to attack the damaged U.S. cruiser. An Australian coastwatcher in the Solomon Islands warned the U.S. forces of the bombers, and estimated their arrival time as 16:00. However, Halsey ordered the other cruisers to leave Chicago behind and head for Efate in the New Hebrides. They departed at 15:00, leaving behind six destroyers to protect Chicago and Navajo.|$|E

500|$|Unable to fire {{her main}} or {{secondary}} batteries {{at the three}} destroyers causing her so much trouble, Hiei instead concentrated on SanFrancisco, which was passing by only [...] away. Along with Kirishima, Inazuma, and Ikazuchi, the four ships made repeated hits on SanFrancisco, disabling her steering control and killing Admiral Callaghan, Captain Cassin Young, {{and most of the}} bridge staff. The first few salvos from Hiei and Kirishima consisted of the special fragmentation bombardment shells, which reduced damage to the interior of SanFrancisco and may have saved her from being sunk outright. Not expecting a ship-to-ship confrontation, it took the crews of the two enemy battleships several minutes to switch to armor-piercing ammunition, and SanFrancisco, almost helpless to defend herself, managed to momentarily sail clear of the melee. She had landed at least one shell in Hieis steering gear room during the exchange, flooding it with water, shorting out her power steering generators, and severely inhibiting Hieis steering capability. Helena followed SanFrancisco <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> her from further harm.|$|E

40|$|This {{course will}} {{provide you with}} an {{understanding}} of the pressures facing kids today [...] what it looks like in our schools and across the country {{and what you can do}} about it in your classroom! Many parents, relatives and educators/professionals devote their lives <b>to</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>protecting</b> children and adolescents from academic and social pressures only to increase their stress levels. We will explore the stress levels of students from numerous angles. We will look at the student who is struggling with the ills of a poverty induced live style as well as Along with technology, the academic expectations have become much more rigorous coupled with the social demands to fit in and excel at all levels. Stress in our students can counter educator’s efforts to provide instructional material as well as a safe and nurturing classroom climate. As school counselors, we have collaborated with teachers at the elementary and secondary levels to successfully implement numerous strategies to change this phenomenon. Breakout sessions and resource materials will ensure that the methods and strategies are developmentally appropriate for the students you work with, as well as their parents. You will also be able to review many of the most regarded and practical books, workbooks and other resources that address stress in students K- 12. Material fee is a $ 5. 00 to be paid to the instructors at class. ...|$|R

[...] In part, this justified the English taking complete control of lands on the European side, but the proclamation did not effectively prevent individual ethnic European colonists from continuing to migrate westward. [...] The British did not have sufficient forces to patrol the border and keep out colonists.

Scott Backmun of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) raised concerns about the city's ability to host the games {{in light of the}} drug war. Due to the increased safety issues the USOC had its own security plan for the games.

40|$|As {{has been}} the case each year of this decade, 1985 was once again a year when the major concern and preoccupation of the Board were the severe {{difficulties}} posed by the shortfall in the allocation received from the Department of Health to run our services.

During the year no opportunity was missed to bring {{to the attention of the}} Minister for Health the effect of the financial cutbacks on services within this region and to highlight the fact that our Board seemed to be more harshly treated in terms of cutbacks than any of the other boards. As the Board which has, probably more than any other, made significant progress in the transfer of care from hospital to community, and which puts a higher proportion of its allocation into community services, it is particularly depressing to see these community services now being cut back as a result of these shortfalls in funding from the centre.
