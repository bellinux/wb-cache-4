5000|$|In 2002, in the United States, 21,904 Christmas <b>tree</b> <b>farms</b> covered 447000 acre of {{cropland}} {{and accounted}} for 20.8 million Christmas trees cut. [...] Of those farms, 686 harvested 100 acre or more, which accounted for over 196,000 of the total acres of trees harvested. That same year, {{there were only three}} U.S. Christmas <b>tree</b> <b>farms</b> with more than 10000 acre of cropland in production. Pennsylvania was home to the most American Christmas <b>tree</b> <b>farms</b> in 2002; the state boasted 2,164 farms.

50|$|Choose and cut <b>tree</b> <b>farms</b> are {{typically}} smaller than fresh cut <b>tree</b> <b>farms</b> because they sell in smaller quantities than fresh cut <b>tree</b> <b>farms.</b> They typically sell {{directly to the}} customer who chooses and then cuts {{his or her own}} tree. Since the trees are cut at the moment of purchase, the limitations of the farm are primarily due to the farm’s geographic location. Needle and color retention are much less of a concern because of the freshness of the trees. For this reason, Christmas tree nurseries that propagate trees for sale to choose and cut <b>tree</b> <b>farms</b> typically sell more species of trees and can be located closer to the Mason-Dixon Line. Some nurseries that specialized in cypress trees are located as far south as Florida.|$|R

Due to Marge being taken {{suddenly}} for overseas deployment while buying a Christmas tree the previous year, Lisa has sworn to never see another Christmas tree until Marge returns home safely. However, during Christmas of 1944, the family gets a telegram saying that Marge is missing in action. After hearing the news, Lisa runs away {{to the place where}} she had last seen her mother, the Christmas <b>Tree</b> <b>Farm.</b> The owner of the place says that Marge paid for a tree the previous year but never picked it up. Lisa, believing the tree to be a symbol that Marge is alright, takes it home and decorates it together with Homer and Bart.

25|$|The first Christmas <b>tree</b> <b>farm</b> was {{established}} in 1901, but most consumers continued to obtain their trees from forests until the 1930s and 1940s. Christmas tree farming was once seen only as a viable alternative for low-quality farmland, but that perception has changed within the agriculture industry. For optimum yield and quality, land should be flat or gently rolling and relatively free of debris and undergrowth.|$|E

25|$|The outlay {{of money}} on {{equipment}} varies greatly. Some items commonly found on Christmas tree farms are insecticide sprayers, tractors, and shaper sheers. Mechanized planters, {{at a cost of}} about US$4,000, are not essential but a work-saving luxury for farmers. Farmers can purchase seedlings, the lifeblood of a Christmas <b>tree</b> <b>farm,</b> from nurseries. One farmer in Oregon purchased seedlings for between US$200–300 per 1,000plants. The farmer, a wholesaler, sold his final products for about $20each; after the cost of the trees and other expenses, a profit of $2–3per tree.|$|E
25|$|Some tree farms {{offer more}} than just a chance to cut down a live Christmas tree. Outdoor and holiday themed {{activities}} are not uncommon and include wagon rides, offering hot cocoa or cider, Santa Claus visits and holiday crafts. Many tree farms actively encourage schools to sponsor field trips to the farms. One grower in Kansas contended that usual worries for businesses, such as a tight economy, do not affect Christmas tree farms. The grower thought that obtaining a tree from a Christmas <b>tree</b> <b>farm</b> was something that almost nothing could stop; an activity that transcended the economy and the weather.|$|E

25|$|Like {{all crops}} and plants, Christmas trees require a {{specific}} set of nutrients to thrive. There are 16elements crucial for growth; of those, three are obtained through air and water: hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen. Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, boron, copper, chlorine, manganese, molybdenum, iron, and zinc are obtained from the soil. If the necessary elements are not available in the local soil, nutritious fertilizers are used. Other important soil considerations include pH and drainage. Certain types of soil are preferable, {{depending on the type of}} tree. Pine trees are usually better adapted to a sandy or sandy loam soil, while white spruce trees and fir trees, such as the Douglas-fir, prefer fine-texture loams and clay loam soils. Some trees grow well in all types of soil, but in any case, the land must be well-drained for a Christmas <b>tree</b> <b>farm</b> to have a chance of thriving.|$|E

500|$|Wormshill {{includes}} two farms: Yew <b>Tree</b> <b>Farm</b> (dairy farming) {{at the south}} end of the village, and Norwood Farm (fruit and other crops) at the north end. A third farm, Home Farm appeared on late 19th and early 20th centuries Ordnance Survey maps in the centre of the village. This farm is no longer in use, but some outbuildings remain. Wormshill at one time included a blacksmith's shop, which is recorded on Ordnance Survey maps until 1898. [...] According to the 1831 Census, 40 of the 48 adult males in the village were employed in the agricultural sector. Census records from the mid-to-late 19th century show a marked increase in the construction of new homes, representing the largest growth in the village for the next 100years; however, the 1901 Census still described the majority of workers as [...] "labourers and servants". The population spike between 1821 and 1901 is a trend typical to the general growth in the need for physical labour from parishes in the Kent downland agricultural region in the 19th century which was followed in the early 20th century by the increasing mechanisation of farming activity. Although the farms continue to employ from the village, as of 2008 Wormshill is largely a dormitory village, with residents employed in nearby towns or commuting to London. The socio-economic classification of Census 2001 indicated that the most common occupations were [...] "lower managerial and professional occupations" [...] (21.9 percent) and [...] "small employers and own account workers" [...] (15.2 percent).|$|E
500|$|During the Second World War, Wormshill {{joined a}} number of similar {{settlements}} {{in the region to}} form part of the anti-invasion network. On the outskirts of the village, near the hamlet of Ringlestone, there are the remains of a zero station (or Operational Base), a secret underground communications relay post operated by Auxiliary Units of the British Home Guard. In the event of a German invasion the zero station was to be used by defending forces to receive and transmit coded messages between a series of similar stations in the area {{as well as to the}} operational command headquarters at Hannington Hall in Wiltshire. A concealed underground concrete bunker, it was designed to be invisible from the surface and is located in woodland about [...] from the road. Although its primary purpose was a communications post, the zero station was also designed to hold ammunition and explosives and provide living quarters for the radio equipment operators. Anecdotal evidence also indicates that anti-aircraft guns were sited near the village and that a Bren gun emplacement was installed in the valley between Wormshill and Frinsted. A Diver Battery was located to the south west of the village. Forming part of the Kentish Gun Belt, designed to provide a defence to attacks by V-1 flying bombs or [...] "doodlebugs", it was armed with eight mobile 3.7-inch guns, and manned by 424 Battery of 138 Regiment of the 40th Anti Aircraft Brigade. It was initially equipped with Predictor AA No.10 and No.3 Mark V radar, and was manned by 57 Brigade in July 1944. [...] There are records of a V-1 being shot down by a Supermarine Spitfire to the west of the village. Flt Lt A. R. Cruikshank is reported as having [...] "Sited a Diver north of Ashford and attacked from astern at 100 yards range. Saw strikes and Diver fell and exploded in a field". [...] Villagers resident during the war also recall a V-1 being shot down in orchards near Norwood Farm and a fighter aircraft crashing in fields to the south of Yew <b>Tree</b> <b>Farm.</b> Roadside checkpoints were set up on the main routes into the village to the north and south and allied forces moving through the region camped overnight in the area, including a detachment of New Zealand troops in fields near Home Farm.|$|E
