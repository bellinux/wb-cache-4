500|$|... "Boy-Scoutz 'n the Hood" [...] {{was written}} by Dan McGrath and {{directed}} by Jeffrey Lynch. The episode was recorded at the Village Recorder in West Los Angeles. Ernest Borgnine guest starred in the episode as himself. The staff liked {{his work on the}} films Marty and From Here to Eternity, so they asked him to do a guest appearance on the show. Borgnine felt he could not say no to the offer because his grandchildren were fans of the show. In the final scene of the episode, Borgnine plays a guitar and sings campfire songs with the children. Borgnine was a guitar player in real life, so he brought his own guitar with him to the recording studio. Borgnine apologized because he felt that he was not being able to sing very well, but Nancy Cartwright, who provides the voice of Bart, thought his voice [...] "added to the authenticity of his character". The Simpsonss creator Matt Groening thought the recording sessions with Borgnine were [...] "so much fun". Hank Azaria, who provides the voice of Apu, commented that Borgnine [...] "had no idea what <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>he</b> was doing. He's a good actor, and he read his lines just fine, but {{he had no idea what}} the show was, no idea what we were doing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Captain Paul Pihl, an {{aircraft}} procurement officer on Horne's staff, blamed {{many of the}} Navy's wartime supply failures on Horne's hands-off management style and lack of logistics expertise. [...] "It was his job", Pihl said after the war, [...] "and he didn't have the faintest idea what <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>he</b> {{was going to do}} with it. Horne had had no previous experience with logistics, and he tended to go by the old Navy tradition that you didn't get involved in {{what was happening in the}} engine room unless something went wrong, and then you brought a person up and bawled him out for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Since Homer {{is placed}} by Chaucer upon {{a pillar of}} iron, he places Virgil upon iron tinned over, to {{indicate}} that the Æneis was based upon the Iliad and was both more polished and less vigorous. The sulphur upon which Claudian stands, is typical of <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>he</b> described in his poem on the Rape of Proserpine. Ovid, the poet of love, is put upon a pillar of copper, because copper was the metal of Venus; and Lucan, like Homer, has a pillar of iron allotted to him because he celebrated in his Pharsalia the wars of Cæsar and Pompey, and, as Chaucer says, ...|$|E

60|$|Nor {{are such}} professors tender of God's name, nor {{of the credit}} of that gospel which they profess; nor can they, for they want that which should oblige them thereunto, which {{is a sense of}} pardon and forgiveness, by the which their broken hearts have been replenished, succoured, and made to hope in God. Paul said, the love of Christ {{constrained}} him. But what was Paul but a broken-hearted and a contrite sinner? (Acts 9:3-6; 2 Cor 5:14). When God shows a man the sin he has committed, <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>he</b> has deserved, the heaven he has lost; and yet that Christ, and grace, and pardon may be had; this will make him serious, this will make him melt, this will break his heart, this will show him that there is more than air, than a noise, than an empty sound in religion; and this is the man, whose heart, whose life, whose conversation and all, will be engaged in the matters of the eternal salvation of his precious and immortal soul.|$|E
60|$|Turnbull was {{not long}} in {{discovering}} this truth in connexion with the cold and colossal machinery of this great asylum. He had been shaken by many spiritual states since the instant when he was pitched head foremost into that private cell {{which was to be}} his private room till death. He had felt a high fit of pride and poetry, which had ebbed away and left him deadly cold. He had known a period of mere scientific curiosity, in the course of which he examined all the tiles of his cell, with the gratifying conclusion that they were all the same shape and size; but was greatly puzzled about the angle in the wall at the end, and also about an iron peg or spike that stood out from the wall, the object of which he does not know to this day. Then he had a period of mere madness not to be written of by decent men, but only by those few dirty novelists hallooed on by the infernal huntsman to hunt down and humiliate human nature. This also passed, but left behind it a feverish distaste for many of the mere objects around him. Long after he had returned to sanity and such hopeless cheerfulness as a man might have on a desert island, he disliked the regular squares of the pattern of wall and floor and the triangle that terminated his corridor. Above all, he had a hatred, deep as <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>he</b> did not believe in, for the objectless iron peg in the wall.|$|E

[...] This led Kazan and Schulberg to meet with independent producer Sam Spiegel, who set up a deal with Columbia.

To Carey, {{the essence of the}} character was: We play safe. Most of us do, most of the time... but Lucifer doesn't know the meaning of safe, and he never bothers to look down at the tramlines. He goes wherever <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>he</b> likes, picks his fights where he finds them and generally wins... following his own will and his own instincts to {{the very end of the}} line, no matter what the obstacles are star.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the thirteenth}} season in 1992, Devane {{resigned}} from {{his role as}} Greg due to the production schedule. Devane said: I resigned. I had had enough. It had gotten so absurd. And I was offered a deal with ABC. I left Knots Landing because I didn't {{want to go in}} the toilet with this shit. The problem really comes down to the writing and {{trying to come up with}} good stories and most of us just said, “ we've done good work and let’s be proud of that and not have the show’s legacy ruined.”". Another reason he resigned was due to the L.A. riots inspired story. [...] "It’s one of the reasons I left. It didn't help, that’s for sure.

I wanted to record it to cassette, hearing the hiss.

He also co-starred with Cassavetes in Mikey and Nicky. Cassavetes, in turn, guest-starred in the Columbo episode [...] "Étude in Black" [...] in 1972. Falk describes his experiences working with Cassavetes specifically remembering his directing strategies: [...] "Shooting an actor when he might be unaware the camera was running." [...] You never knew when the camera might be going. And it was never: 'Stop. Cut. Start again.' John would walk {{in the middle of a}} scene and talk, and though you didn't realize it, the camera kept going. So I never knew what <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>he</b> was doing.

According to Miller: [...] "Skippy changed radically {{when we were in}} New York. There were some people there (he met) who were into harder drugs and a harder lifestyle, and some very weird shit. And so he kind of flew off with those people. Skippy kind of disappeared for a little while.
