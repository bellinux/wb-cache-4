The system was embedded mostly in the monsoon trough, surrounded by favorable environmental conditions, which prompted the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 0030UTC on March24. Convection increased as vertical wind shear decreased, and the system developed a curved band pattern. Throughout the day, the storm showed signs of potential rapid intensification, due to its quick organization. <b>The</b> <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> Meteorology's Perth Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (Perth TCWC) noted {{the system as a}} tropical low at 1000UTC on March24, and the JTWC issued its first warning two hours later.

5|$|In July 1941, Radford was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} Naval Air Station in Trinidad, British West Indies. He protested this appointment because he feared he would remain there for years, sidelined as World War II loomed. In the event he only remained in this station for three months, following an organizational shift in <b>the</b> <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> Aeronautics. By mid-1941, thanks to a large expansion in the naval aviator program, squadrons could no longer train newly arrived aviators. Further, at that time, the vast difference {{in the performance of}} combat aircraft over training aircraft meant that pilots needed more time in combat aircraft before becoming proficient in them. Radford was subsequently visited by Artemus L. Gates, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Air. The latter was so impressed that he ordered Rear Admiral John H.
