5|$|Henson's 1960s {{talk show}} {{appearances}} culminated when he devised Rowlf, a piano-playing anthropomorphic dog. Rowlf {{became the first}} Muppet to make regular appearances on a network show, The Jimmy Dean Show. Henson was so grateful for <b>this</b> <b>break</b> that he offered Jimmy Dean a 40% interest in his production company, but Dean declined, stating that Henson deserved all the rewards for his own work, a decision of conscience Dean never regretted. From 1963 to 1966, Henson began exploring film-making and produced a series of experimental films. His nine-minute experimental film, Time Piece, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film in 1966. The year 1969 saw the production of The Cube, another Henson-produced experimental movie.|$|E
5|$|The {{next two}} periods of {{geologic}} history, the Ordovician and the Silurian, are {{missing from the}} Grand Canyon sequence. Geologists {{do not know if}} sediments were deposited in these periods and were later removed by erosion or if they were never deposited in the first place. Either way, <b>this</b> <b>break</b> in the geologic history of the area spans about 65million years. A type of unconformity called a disconformity was formed. Disconformities show erosional features such as valleys, hills and cliffs that are later covered by younger sediments.|$|E
5|$|Topoisomerases are enzymes {{with both}} {{nuclease}} and ligase activity. These proteins change {{the amount of}} supercoiling in DNA. Some of these enzymes work by cutting the DNA helix and allowing one section to rotate, thereby reducing its level of supercoiling; the enzyme then seals the DNA break. Other types of these enzymes are capable of cutting one DNA helix and then passing a second strand of DNA through <b>this</b> <b>break,</b> before rejoining the helix. Topoisomerases are required for many processes involving DNA, such as DNA replication and transcription.|$|E

5|$|After {{performances}} in Japan, China, Australia and New Zealand in March/April 2006, the Rolling Stones tour took a scheduled break before proceeding to Europe; during <b>this</b> <b>break</b> Keith Richards was hospitalised in New Zealand for cranial surgery after a fall {{from a tree}} on Fiji, {{where he had been}} on holiday. The incident led to a six-week delay in launching the European leg of the tour. In June 2006 it was reported that Ronnie Wood was continuing his programme of rehabilitation for alcohol abuse, but this did not affect the rearranged European tour schedule. Two out of the 21 shows scheduled for July–September 2006 were later cancelled due to Mick Jagger's throat problems. The Rolling Stones returned to North America for concerts in September 2006, and returned to Europe on 5 June 2007. By November 2006, the Bigger Bang tour had been declared the highest grossing tour of all time.|$|E
5|$|Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan now had the {{financial}} resources to produce shows themselves, without outside backers. Carte persuaded the author and composer that a business partnership among the three would be to their advantage, and they hatched a plan to separate themselves from {{the directors of the}} Comedy Opera Company. The contract between Gilbert and Sullivan and the Comedy Opera Company gave the latter the right to present Pinafore {{for the duration of the}} initial run. The Opera Comique was obliged to close for drain and sewer repairs, and it was renovated by E. W. Bradwell, from Christmas 1878 to the end of January 1879. Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte believed that <b>this</b> <b>break</b> ended the initial run, and, therefore, ended the company's rights. Carte put the matter beyond doubt by taking a six-month personal lease of the theatre beginning on 1 February 1879, the date of its re-opening, when Pinafore resumed. At the end of the six months, Carte planned to give notice to the Comedy Opera Company that its rights in the show and the theatre had ended.|$|E
5|$|Dartmouth—faster than Bristol—closed to {{effective}} engagement range with the Austro-Hungarian ships, and opened fire. A shell from Dartmouth struck Novara, {{at which point}} the Austro-Hungarian ships laid a smoke screen in order to close the distance. Dartmouth was struck several times, and by 11:00, Acton ordered the ship to reduce speed to allow Bristol to catch up. Novara was hit several more times, and her main feed pumps and starboard auxiliary steam pipe had been damaged, which caused the ship to begin losing speed. At 11:05, Acton turned away in an attempt to separate Saida from Novara and Helgoland. At this point, Sankt Georg was approaching the scene, which prompted Acton to temporarily withdraw to consolidate his forces. <b>This</b> <b>break</b> in the action was enough time for the Austro-Hungarians to save the crippled Novara; Saida took the ship under tow while Helgoland covered them.|$|E

5|$|Tariffs {{had been}} raised to high levels during the Civil War. Afterwards, Garfield, who made a close study of {{financial}} affairs, advocated moving towards free trade, though the standard Republican position was a protective tariff that would allow American industries to grow. <b>This</b> <b>break</b> with his party likely cost him his place on the Ways and Means Committee in 1867, and though Republicans held {{the majority in the}} House until 1875, Garfield remained off that committee during that time. Garfield came to chair the powerful House Appropriations Committee, but it was Ways and Means, with its influence over fiscal policy, that he really wanted to lead. Part of the reason Garfield was denied a place on Ways and Means was the opposition of the influential Republican editor, Horace Greeley.|$|E

25|$|In most (but not all) iambic senarius lines {{there is}} a word-break or caesura after the fifth element, {{corresponding}} to the dieresis in {{the centre of the}} trochaic septenarius. However, as {{can be seen from the}} examples below, there is usually no break in the sense at this point. The main effect of <b>this</b> <b>break</b> is that the fourth element of the line usually coincides with the word-accent.|$|E
25|$|In nature, these {{proteins}} are encoded by mobile genetic elements, introns or inteins. Introns propagate by intervening at {{a precise}} {{location in the}} DNA, where {{the expression of the}} meganuclease produces a break in the complementary intron- or intein-free allele. For inteins and group I introns, <b>this</b> <b>break</b> leads to the duplication of the intron or intein at the cutting site by means of the homologous recombination repair for double-stranded DNA breaks.|$|E

Both Triple-A leagues share a common All-Star break, with no regular-season games scheduled for two days before the All-Star Game itself.

During <b>this</b> <b>break,</b> Almodóvar had an idea for Talk to Her (2002), a film about two men, played by Javier Cámara and Darío Grandinetti, who become friends while {{taking care of the}} comatose women they love, played by Leonor Watling and Rosario Flores. Combining elements of modern dance and silent filmmaking with a narrative that embraces coincidence and fate, in the film, Almodóvar plots the lives of his characters, thrown together by unimaginably bad luck, towards an unexpected conclusion.|$|E

25|$|His record {{break of}} 4,137 {{was made in}} a match he lost against Joe Davis at Thurston Hall on 19 January 1932. However, this precipitated {{a change in the}} rules of the game. As <b>this</b> <b>break</b> mostly {{consisted}} of long runs of close cannons (a total of 902 cannons were scored), the Billiards Control Council established the first version of the baulk-line-rule, in which the cue ball had to cross the baulk line every 200 points during a break. A 1932 tour of the United States and Canada by several players, including Lindrum, proved a disaster, with disappointing attendances and financial losses by the players.|$|E

He was so impressed by Tagawa's extraordinary skill with a tenor banjo and versatility that he offered him a contract to play at his restaurant in the U.S. <b>This</b> <b>break</b> for Tagawa was also a great break for the jazz enthusiasts of northern California. After reaching the United States, Zenzo Tagawa was rapidly Americanized to Charlie Tagawa and soon after he was discovered by numerous restaurant patrons as well as other banjo players in the area.

Koizumi said that <b>this</b> <b>break</b> from tradition was done to gain more third-party support for the console by using an SOC that developers could easily port to. Koizumi said that they were not focused on raw processing power, but were instead looking to balance the overall features of the system, including battery life and size. For this reason, they did not opt to use the more powerful hardware they could have used, instead using a middle-ground approach to achieve their vision of the Switch.|$|E
