40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the <b>total</b> <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> of raising external equity capital for US real estate investment trust (REIT) initial public offerings (IPOs). Design/methodology/approach – The study provides recent evidence on <b>total</b> <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> for a comprehensive dataset of 125 US REIT IPOs from 1996 until June 2010. A multivariate OLS regression is performed to determine significant factors influencing the level of <b>total</b> <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> and also underwriting fees and non-underwriting direct expenses. Findings – The study finds economies of scale in <b>total</b> <b>direct</b> <b>costs,</b> underwriting fees and non-underwriting expenses. The equally (value) weighted average <b>total</b> <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> are 8. 33 percent (7. 52 percent), consisting of 6. 49 percent (6. 30 percent) underwriting fees and 1. 87 percent (1. 22 percent) non-underwriting direct expenses. The study finds a declining trend of <b>total</b> <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> for post 2000 IPOs which is attributed to the declining trend in both underwriting fees and non-underwriting direct expenses. Offer size is a critical determinant for both <b>total</b> <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> and their individual components and inversely affects these costs. The <b>total</b> <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> are found significantly higher for equity REITs than for mortgage REITs and are also significantly higher for offers listed in New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Underwriting fees appear to be negatively influenced by the offer price, the number of representative underwriters involved in the issue, industry return volatility and the number of potential specific risk factors but positively influenced by prior quarter industry dividend yield and ownership limit identified in the prospectus. After controlling for time trend, the paper finds REIT IPOs incur higher non-underwriting direct expenses in response to higher industry return volatility prior to the offer. Originality/value – This paper adds to the international REIT IPO literature by exploring a number of new influencing factors behind <b>total</b> <b>direct</b> <b>costs,</b> underwriting fees and non-underwriting direct expenses.

Objectives: The objectives of this study were to determine the <b>total</b> <b>direct</b> medical <b>cost</b> of managing maxillofacial trauma caused by motor vehicle accidents and the associated factors. Patients and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 73 participants treated for maxillofacial trauma due to motor vehicle accidents at Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia from 1 st January 2010 to 31 st December 2010. The outcome variable was <b>total</b> <b>direct</b> medical <b>cost</b> consisted of the sum of macro-cost and micro-cost. The association between <b>total</b> <b>direct</b> medical <b>cost</b> and study factors (socio-demographic factors, mode of injury and clinical characteristics) were analyzed using general linear regression. Box-Cox transformation was used to transform <b>total</b> <b>direct</b> medical <b>cost</b> in the regression analysis. Results: The median <b>total</b> <b>direct</b> medical <b>cost</b> was RM 5, 899. 51 and ranged from RM 82 to RM 1. 5 million. The average cost per-person was RM 58, 398. 20. The cost consisted 97. 3 and 2. 7 percent of macro-cost and micro-cost respectively. Factors significantly associated with the transformed <b>total</b> <b>direct</b> medical <b>cost</b> were the length of stay in hospital (regression coefficient 0. 08, 95 % confidence interval 0. 03, 0. 12; P= 0. 001), number of facial soft tissue injury (regression coefficient - 1. 08, 95 % confidence interval - 1. 78, - 0. 38; P= 0. 003) and number of maxillofacial fracture (regression coefficient 1. 64, 95 % confidence interval 0. 44, 2. 84; P= 0. 008).

By analyzing only expired patients, these studies cannot identify differences across hospitals in health outcomes like mortality. This study examines the association between mortality and resource use at the hospital level, when all Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for heart failure are examined. Methods and Results-A total of 3999 individuals hospitalized with a principal diagnosis of heart failure at 6 California teaching hospitals between January 1, 2001, and June 30, 2005, were analyzed with multivariate risk-adjustment models for total hospital days, total hospital direct costs, and mortality within 180 -days after initial admission ("Looking Forward"). A subset of 1639 individuals who died {{during the study period}} were analyzed with multivariate risk-adjustment models for total hospital days and total hospital direct costs within 180 -days before death ("Looking Back"). "Looking Forward" risk-adjusted hospital means ranged from 17. 0 % to 26. 0 % for mortality, 7. 8 to 14. 9 days for total hospital days, and 0. 66 to 1. 30 times the mean value for indexed <b>total</b> <b>direct</b> <b>costs.</b> Spearman rank correlation coefficients were - 0. 68 between mortality and hospital days, and - 0. 93 between mortality and indexed <b>total</b> <b>direct</b> <b>costs.</b> "Looking Back" risk-adjusted hospital means ranged from 9. 1 to 21. 7 days for total hospital days and 0. 91 to 1. 79 times the mean value for indexed <b>total</b> <b>direct</b> <b>costs.</b> Variation in resource use site ranks between expired and all individuals were attributable to insignificant differences.

Of this, 80 % was attributed to inpatient costs. Total costs were most sensitive to the underlying incidence rates and to assumptions regarding service utilisation. Conclusions: Our study provides a snapshot of costs incurred on stroke in rural South Africa. We show that stroke is a disease with high economic costs. Further studies that assess the lifetime costs of stroke are needed to better understand savings accrued from intervening at different stages of the disease...|$|E
30|$|For {{all cases}} it can clearly been {{seen that the}} total cost, in this case {{including}} the discounted <b>total</b> <b>direct</b> <b>cost</b> of heat exchangers and the utilities, is lower in the cases with heat integration than in the corresponding cases without heat integration, the former being between 28 and 37 % less expensive than the latter. The main cost item {{is the cost of}} utilities, which accounts for more than 75 - 90 % of the total cost, depending on the case. Approximately 90 % of the utility cost was for heating.|$|R
40|$|The {{logic of}} {{subsidiarity}} suggests that problems of global scope require solutions {{at that level}} as well. The case for global democratic federalism is briefly stated. A planet-wide citizen’s income (PWCI) is proposed as one component {{in a set of}} integrated initiatives for confronting persistent and growing global imbalances. Alternative estimates are provided for the individual allocations and the <b>total</b> <b>direct</b> <b>cost</b> of three different levels of planet-wide stipends and are contrasted, inter alia, with present levels of official development assistance. Estimates are made of the tax levels necessary to sustain the three funding alternatives...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} was to estimate the annual <b>direct</b> disease-related <b>cost</b> of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) during the first 6 yr and to determine which socio-demographic and clinical characteristics relate to these costs. The study population consisted of 424 RA patients {{who had participated in}} a (population-based) trial on therapeutic strategies for early RA since 1990 and were not lost to follow-up in April 1996. A questionnaire on costs due to RA was sent to these patients; 363 (86 %) completed questionnaires were analysed. The <b>total</b> annual <b>direct</b> <b>cost</b> per patient was estimated by adding up the costs of health care workers, days admitted to care facilities, medication, monitoring for side-effects, alternative medicine, adaptations in the home, devices, and other <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> such as travelling expenses. The mean annual <b>direct</b> <b>cost</b> due to RA was estimated to be Dfl. 11, 550 per patient. An obvious increase in <b>direct</b> <b>cost</b> with increasing disease duration was not found. Patients with higher disease activity exhibited significantly higher costs compared to patients with lower disease activity. A multiple logistic regression model showed that greater disability and lower age increased the odds for high <b>costs.</b> The annual <b>direct</b> <b>cost</b> of RA averaged out at Dfl. 11, 550 per patient (i. e. Pound Sterling 3680). A high <b>total</b> <b>direct</b> <b>cost</b> in the first 6 yr of disease is related to severe functional disability and lower ag...|$|R
