40|$|Varnish {{coatings}} {{sensitive to}} UV and/or electron beam radiation were previously applied as a masking layer on the substrate using the spin-on process. In the process {{according to the}} invention for applying the varnish coating sensitive to UV and/or electron beam radiation, a substance containing vinyl and a linear or cyclical siloxane are vaporized and then deposited in the chemical vapour phase on the substrate to be masked. According to a main feature, the substance involves octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane and <b>trivinyl</b> methyl silane...|$|E
40|$|Two {{directional}} ring-closing metathesis (RCM) {{was applied}} successfully to {{the synthesis of}} 4 '-vinylated carbocyclic nucleoside analogues from the <b>trivinyl</b> intermediate 12, which was readily made using a sequential Claisen rearrangement and ring-closing metathesis (RCM) starting from Weinreb amide 5. An antiviral evaluation of the synthesized compounds against various viruses such as HIV, HSV- 1, HSV- 2 and HCMV revealed that the guanine analogue 20 have moderate anti-HIV activity in the MT- 4 cell line (EC 50 = 10. 2 Î¼M).
