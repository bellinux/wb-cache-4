40|$|We {{study the}} effect of {{resonant}} absorption of surface sausage and surface kink modes under photospheric conditions where <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> surface sausage modes undergo resonant damping in <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> continuum and <b>the</b> surface kink modes in <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> and Alfvén continua at the transitional layers. We use recently derived analytical formulas to obtain the damping rate (time). By considering linear density and linear pressure profiles for the transitional layers, we show that resonant absorption in <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> continuum could be an efficient mechanism for the wave damping of <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> surface sausage and slow surface kink modes whilst the damping rate of <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> surface kink mode in the Alfvén continuum is weak. It is {{also found that the}} resonant damping of the fast surface kink mode is much stronger than that of <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> surface kink mode, showing a similar efficiency as under coronal conditions.

Depolarization of Cell 5 at a sufficient interval after <b>the</b> preceding <b>slow</b> potential elicited synaptic potentials and slow potential. Hyperpolarization impeded the development of <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> potential. 2. Synaptic potentials occurred repetitively during depolarization.

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the dynamics of a slow-fast stochastic evolutionary system quantified with a scale parameter. An invariant foliation decomposes the state space into geometric regions of different dynamical regimes, and thus helps understand dynamics. A slow invariant foliation is established for this system. It is shown that <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> foliation converges to a critical foliation (i. e., the scale parameter is zero) in probability distribution, as the scale parameter tends to zero. <b>The</b> approximation of <b>slow</b> foliation is also constructed with error estimate in distribution. Furthermore, the geometric structure of <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> foliation is investigated: every fiber of <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> foliation parallels each other, with <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> manifold as a special fiber. In fact, when an arbitrarily chosen point of a fiber falls in <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> manifold, <b>the</b> fiber must be <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> manifold itself...|$|R

By us-ing three different methods, associated with <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> manifold equations of the L-H system are obtained. Firstly, <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> manifold equation of the nonlinear chaotic dynamic system is obtained by considering that <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> manifold is locally {{defined by a}} plane orthogonal to the tangent system’s left fast eigenvector. On the condition that zTλ 1 (X) · X ̇ = 0, <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> man-ifold equation of the L-H system is built. And secondly, another method consists of defining <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> manifold as <b>the</b> surface generated by <b>the</b> two <b>slow</b> eigenvectors associated with the two eigenvalues λ 2 (X) and λ 3 (X) of J(X). Another slow manifold equation of the L-H system is obtained. Thirdly, by geometric singular perturbation theory, we give <b>the</b> new <b>slow</b> manifold equation that is concrete and terse of the L-H system. Finally, we apply our results to derive <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> manifold equations of some known classical chaotic systems, such as the chua’s system, the Lorenz system, the Chen’s system and Lü’s system, and analyze the dynamical behavior of the S-FADS...|$|R
