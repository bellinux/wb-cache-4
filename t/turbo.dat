Vanellope's glitch reveals {{he is actually}} <b>Turbo,</b> who took over Sugar Rush, displacing Vanellope as the main character. Ralph, Felix, and Calhoun evacuate the game, but Vanellope cannot leave due to her glitch. When Calhoun points out the Cy-Bugs can be destroyed by a beacon of light as per Hero's Duty, Ralph decides to make Diet Cola Mountain erupt to replicate it. Ralph is confronted by <b>Turbo,</b> now fused with a Cy-Bug that devoured him, and <b>Turbo</b> carries him away. Ralph breaks free, hits the mountain, and causes it to erupt, but Vanellope saves him using her glitch. The volcanic beacon destroys the Cy-Bugs and <b>Turbo.</b>|$|E

5|$|Building on the {{features}} of the XT, Ford Australia at one point considered not releasing the sports-oriented Falcon XR6 because of the new XR6 <b>Turbo</b> model. However, Ford overturned this decision before production. A specifically designed body kit distinguished the XR6 from other variants, except for the XR6 <b>Turbo</b> and XR8 which shared the sports bodywork. The naturally aspirated engine was identical to the engine used on the XT and Futura, and the five-speed manual transmission came as standard.|$|E

5|$|The {{station was}} of a similar design to other local power {{stations}} at Carville and Lemington, and was a large triple-gabled brick building. However Dunston A was built several years after the other local stations, and so because of advances in power station design, was larger {{and was able to}} produce more electricity than the others. The station was originally equipped with two turbo-alternators rated at 7.2megawatts (MW), made by AEG of Germany, and two <b>turbo</b> alternators rated at 6.25MW and 13.2MW, made by Brown Boveri of Switzerland, for a total generating capacity of 33.85MW. The <b>turbo</b> alternators were supplied with steam from 24coal burning Babcock & Wilcox marine water-tube boilers.|$|E

Other supported NAS devices are the Buffalo Kurobox Pro, GLAN Tank, Thecus N2100 and QNAP <b>Turbo</b> Stations.|$|E
5|$|Each boiler powered a <b>turbo</b> generator, made by Parsons, Newcastle upon Tyne. These were three-cylinder {{reaction}} type {{steam turbines}} operating at 3,000rpm, generating 60MW of electricity. The stations used {{them because of}} a Statutory Order of the Ministry of Supply in November 1947 that all <b>turbo</b> alternators made for the home market could only be of 60MW at advanced steam conditions. Stella South had a total generating capacity of 300MW and Stella North originally 240MW (later recorded as only 224MW). The stations {{were the first to}} use silica removal beds in their turbines, a development which became standard within the CEGB's power stations for some time. In 1967, one of the sets at Stella South became the world's first in commercial operation to use brushless excitation. The set was modified by Parsons to use A.C. exciters and silicon diode rectifiers. The stations' switchgear was manufactured by A. Reyrolle & Company.|$|E

5|$|Imperator Nikolai I {{had four}} Curtiss-AEG main and two {{auxiliary}} <b>turbo</b> generators with each driving two dynamos, one each {{for alternating current}} and direct current. Each main generator was rated at 360 kilowatts while the auxiliaries had a capacity of 200 kilowatts each. These powered the complex electrical system that combined alternating current for most equipment with direct current for heavy-load machinery like the turret motors. No diesel generators were provided.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of a collision with Esteban Gutiérrez in the Australian Grand Prix, Fernando Alonso was ruled out of the event with broken ribs and a pneumothorax, and as a result was replaced with McLaren reserve driver Stoffel Vandoorne. Gutiérrez received a new chassis after his team found that his original chassis was too damaged to be repaired, mostly caused by the crane during the recovery process and not in the accident itself. Meanwhile, Ferrari were able to use the same engine in Kimi Räikkönen's car as they had done in Australia, even though it had caught fire following a failure of the <b>turbo</b> charger. Swift reactions by the team on the scene prevented damage to the combustion engine, with only the <b>turbo</b> changed for Bahrain. Alfonso Celis Jr. made his first appearance in a Formula One session during the first free practice for Force India.|$|E

5|$|The Iazyges and the Roxolani invaded Lower Pannonia and Lower Moesia, respectively, in 117. The war was {{probably}} {{brought on by}} difficulties in visiting and trading with each other due {{to the location of}} Dacia between them. The Dacian provincial governor, Gaius Julius Quadratus Bassus, was killed in the invasion. The Roxolani surrendered first, so {{it is likely that the}} Romans exiled and then replaced their client king with one of their choosing. The Iazyges then concluded peace with Rome. The Iazyges and other Sarmatians invaded Roman Dacia in 123, likely for the same reason as the previous war of not being allowed to visit and trade with each other, Marcius <b>Turbo</b> stationed a thousand legionaries in Potaissa and Porolissum. The Romans probably used these towns as the invasion point into Rivulus Dominarum. Marcius <b>Turbo</b> succeeded in defeating the Iazyges; however, the terms of the peace, and the date, are not known.|$|E
