5|$|The {{sixth and}} first killer tornado of the {{outbreak}} touched down around 3:10a.m. EST and snapped several trees. After traveling for {{three quarters of}} a mile, it produced significant structural damage along North Carolina Highway 222 where a brick home was destroyed. A nearby trailer was rolled 30ft down <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> <b>of</b> the home. The four residents sustained no injuries despite having not taken shelter before the tornado. A double-wide mobile home was blown off its foundation and flipped for 50ft before falling to the ground. One of the occupants, a 61-year-old woman was killed and her husband sustained major injuries. Three other mobile homes were destroyed by the tornado before it crossed into Wilson County. Once in Wilson County, several more mobile homes sustained significant damage before the tornado lifted. Damages from the tornado in both counties amounted to $700,000. The tornado was rated as an EF2 by the National Weather Service.|$|E
5|$|On December 31, 2008, Bellaire police {{officers}} confronted Robbie Tolan, {{the son of}} former Major League Baseball player Bobby Tolan, in <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> <b>of</b> his house at the 800 block of Woodstock. Officers suspected Tolan, who was unarmed, of stealing a sports utility vehicle in the driveway and shot Tolan in the chest; Tolan's family owned the vehicle. Tolan was hospitalized with injuries to one lung and a liver. The incident sparked allegations of racial profiling. Members of minority groups reported that Bellaire police racially profiled people. In 2002, José Cruz, Jr., son of baseball player José Cruz, was stopped since his vehicle was missing a front license plate. He was arrested by Bellaire police and spent one night in jail after Bellaire law enforcement {{told him that he}} had a warrant for his arrest. The Houston Chronicle said that the Bellaire police decision to arrest Cruz was a mistake. In January 2009, Cruz accused the police of racial profiling. Mayor Cindy Siegel said that she was unaware of racial profiling by police. Siegel announced that the city will investigate racial profiling and hire an independent consultant to look at traffic stop data. The local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) branch said that it established a pact with the City of Bellaire; people may report civil rights violations from Bellaire Police to the branch if the people do not wish to contact the City of Bellaire. However, the NAACP branch has not yet provided the city with any civil rights violations. On April 6, 2009, a Harris County grand jury indicted Sergeant Jeffrey Cotton, the police officer, for aggravated assault by a public servant. If convicted, Cotton could face up to life in prison. In addition the family sued the police department and the police officer. The upcoming trial in Harris County District Court on criminal felony charges against Cotton began on January 25, 2010. Jury selection was scheduled to begin on May 3, 2010. The officer was found not guilty in his criminal trial in May 2010.|$|E

500|$|... "Stay Together for the Kids" [...] {{is written}} about divorce {{from the point}} of view of a {{helpless}} child. Its heavier sound was inspired by bands the group's members were listening to in the two weeks they wrote their fourth album, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, such as Fugazi and Refused.

500|$|The {{music video}} {{revolves}} around the fantasy of a computer store employee, as he dreams about a relationship with Carey. Throughout the video, the pair is seen to have a pillow fight; play laser tag, Guitar Hero and slot cars; and throw a frisbee. The video also features Carey in various revealing outfits. The video begins with a small Compu Nerd Volkswagen, parodying Geek Squad, pulling up into <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> <b>of</b> Carey's large manor. As the employee introduces himself, Carey flippantly refers {{to him as a}} [...] "CompuNerd", and asks him to follow her to the broken computer. As he attends to it, Carey removes her robe, and enters her large closet, leaving McBrayer to begin his fantasy with her. The first scene is of Carey wearing a tight pink number, laying seductively on the bed, as the computer employee plays with an electric guitar. He joins her on the bed, and she begins playfully spanking him as the two enter a pillow fight. Another scene is interspersed, of Carey sporting a mini silver dress, with tall socks and heels, flaunting her body. The fantasy then adapts to a new scenery, of the pair dressed in medieval clothing, while walking a unicorn, followed by the duo in a large room in the mansion, racing electronic cars. As they proceed to play laser tag, they are shown outside, laying on a picnic bed, with Carey dressed in a [...] "naughty school girl outfit". They both get up, and begin to throw a frisbee, before relocating in front of the main stairwell in the mansion. The final scenes of the fantasy are of Carey, wearing a shortened red gown, standing atop the staircase, and McBrayer climbing on his knees while carrying flowers. All the scenes begin to fade, with the last being Carey feeding him by hand by the refrigerator, as he wakes up with Carey, now dressed, poking him. She tells the employee that security will let him out when he is finished, and leaves him while he is still fantasizing about her.|$|E
