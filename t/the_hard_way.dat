5|$|Jailhouse Rock was Presley's third {{film and}} his first for MGM. It was filmed at the MGM studios in Culver City, California. Filmed in black-and-white, the film was the first {{production}} that MGM filmed with the recently developed 35mm anamorphic lens by Panavision. The film was originally titled <b>The</b> <b>Hard</b> <b>Way,</b> which was changed to Jailhouse Kid before MGM finally settled on Jailhouse Rock. It was not listed with the studio's planned releases for the year, which it published in Variety magazine, because {{it was based on}} an original story by Nedrick Young, a blacklisted writer. In addition, the studio traditionally did not produce any original scripts that were not adaptations of already-successful works such as books or theater plays. During the production of the movie, Pandro Berman's attention was centered on another of his productions, the 1958 film The Brothers Karamazov. He let the head of the studio, Benny Thau, and Abe Lastfogel, president of the William Morris Agency, decide the cast. Richard Thorpe, who had the reputation of quickly finishing his projects, was chosen to direct the film.|$|E
5|$|In The Simpsons twentieth {{episode of}} the twentieth season, Four Great Women and a Manicure is loosely based on Macbeth. In the third act of the episode, Marge embodies Lady Macbeth, an ambitious wife who is {{frustrated}} by everything around her. She not only has to clean the costumes worn by other actors, but is also frustrated {{over the fact that}} Homer doesn't have any interest in auditioning for lead roles and would rather play a tree. She convinces him to kill Sideshow Mel and he does to assume the lead role of Macbeth. When Marge learns that no one cares for Homer's lack of acting skills over Hibbert's and those with no lines, she forces him to kill off everyone else until he's the only actor left. The angry spirits visit her that night and she tries to pin the blame on Homer. They refuse to believe Marge by pointing out that they knew he was a victim in her devious plans and get their revenge on her by killing her in a fright induced heart attack. Even though Homer gives Marge's ghost a promising performance, he eventually frustrates her more by killing himself so he doesn't have to audition for more Shakespearean plays. This forces Marge to learn her lesson <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>way</b> when she must spend eternity with a lazy and happy Homer.|$|E

25|$|The Vikings {{came into}} the game with great {{confidence}} internally but none by the wider league. They showed {{what it meant to}} be Vikings on that day player all phases and pushing the Undefeated Champions, who won the Bowl by a huge margin against the Dublin Rebels, to their limits. It was not enough and in the end a 22-man squad could not last against the huge numbers and freshness of the Belfast Trojans team. Many players felt it was one of the gutsiest Vikings performances in recent years but just not good enough. Excellent young players like Sean Goldrick, Ian Cahill, Paul Keane, Shane Gleeson and Eoin Whelan matured on the field and bode well for the Future of the team. Overall, the Vikings learned <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>way</b> that you can't win if you don't score no matter how good your Defence is as was the story of their entire season and many seasons past. The future is bright for this new generation of Vikings and keep a close eye on 2014 which is sure to be a huge one for this team.|$|E
25|$|Konbaung {{troops would}} {{now have to}} take Syriam <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>way.</b> The siege {{continued}} {{for the remainder of}} 1755.

In July, Alaungpaya launched another attack by water and by land, capturing the only French ship left at the port, and the French factory at the outskirts of the town. On 14 July 1756 (3rd waning of Waso 1118 ME), Minhla Minkhaung Kyaw, the chief of musket corps and top Konbaung general, was severely wounded by cannon fire. As Minhla Minkhaung Kyaw lay dying of his wounds, and being brought back by boat, the king went down to the boat himself to see his old childhood friend, who had won him many battles. The king publicly mourned the death of his chief general and honored him with a funeral under a white umbrella before the whole army. The leader of the French, Sieur de Bruno, secretly tried to negotiate with Alaungpaya, but was found out and put in prison by Hanthawaddy commanders. The siege went on.|$|E
25|$|Nova wears a {{standard}} Xandarian StarCorps uniform, {{designed to accommodate}} his powers without being damaged by them. The uniform is highly resistant to damage, including outer space conditions, and is airtight. In addition, the uniform has a built-in life support function that can sustain Rider under the most extreme environmental conditions, including acting as a life-support suit by locking off the mouth and eyes of the helmet. The helmet contains a radio, telescopic sights, night vision sensors, and heat imaging sensors, {{as well as a}} visual heads-up display for tracking energy signatures. Nova's helmet has a rigid construction and shape when worn, but becomes as malleable as cloth when it is not, allowing Rider to hide it in his civilian clothes when desired. Nova's uniform is not only extremely malleable, but contains specific functions to aid Rider in his role as a Nova Corps Centurion. Among these features are an electromagnetic discharge that can nullify gravity and an interface to stargates that allow him to enter hyperspace, where he can move at velocities exceeding the speed of light. Rider can also alter the appearance and nature of his uniform to suit his needs. However, as Rider learns <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>way,</b> the Nova Corps keeps a strict dress code. When he makes major cosmetic changes to his uniform after rejoining the New Warriors, Nova is summarily ordered to conform to standard.|$|E
