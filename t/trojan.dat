5|$|<b>Trojan</b> moons are {{a unique}} feature only {{known from the}} Saturnian system. A <b>trojan</b> body orbits at either the leading L4 or {{trailing}} L5 Lagrange point {{of a much larger}} object, such as a large moon or planet. Tethys has two <b>trojan</b> moons, Telesto (leading) and Calypso (trailing), and Dione also has two, Helene (leading) and Polydeuces (trailing). Helene is by far the largest <b>trojan</b> moon, while Polydeuces is the smallest and has the most chaotic orbit. These moons are coated with dusty material that has smoothened out their surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Belief in {{the medieval}} {{tradition}} of the <b>Trojan</b> War that followed Dictys and Dares survived the Revival of Learning in the Renaissance {{and the advent of}} the first English translation of the Iliad in the form of Chapman's Homer. (Shakespeare used both Homer and Lefevre as sources for his Troilus.) However the two supposedly eye-witness accounts were finally discredited by Jacob Perizonius {{in the early years of}} the 18th century. With the chief source for his portrayal as one of the most active warriors of the <b>Trojan</b> War undermined, Troilus has become an optional character in modern <b>Trojan</b> fiction, except for those that retell the love story itself. Lindsay Clarke and Phillip Parotti, for example, omit Troilus altogether. Hilary Bailey includes a character of that name in Cassandra: Princess of Troy but little remains of the classical or medieval versions except that he fights Diomedes. However, some of the over sixty re-tellings of the <b>Trojan</b> War since 1916 do feature the character.|$|E

5000|$|The {{amount of}} high-inclination objects {{in such a}} small sample, in which {{relatively}} fewer high-inclination Neptune <b>trojans</b> are known due to observational biases, implies that high-inclination <b>trojans</b> may significantly outnumber low-inclination <b>trojans.</b> The ratio of high- to low-inclination Neptune <b>trojans</b> {{is estimated to be}} about 4:1. Assuming albedos of 0.05, there are an expected [...] Neptune <b>trojans</b> with radii above 40 km in Neptune's [...] This would indicate that large Neptune <b>trojans</b> are 5 to 20 times more abundant than Jupiter <b>trojans,</b> depending on their albedos. There may be relatively fewer smaller Neptune <b>trojans,</b> which could be because these fragment more readily. Large [...] <b>trojans</b> are estimated to be as common as large [...] <b>trojans.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{team from}} the Keck Observatory in Hawaii {{announced}} in 2006 that it had measured {{the density of the}} binary Jupiter <b>trojan</b> 617 Patroclus as being less than that of water ice (0.8g/cm3), suggesting that the pair, and possibly many other <b>Trojan</b> objects, more closely resemble comets or Kuiper belt objects in composition—water ice with a layer of dust—than they do the main-belt asteroids. Countering this argument, the density of Hektor as determined from its rotational lightcurve (2.480g/cm3) is significantly higher than that of 617 Patroclus. Such a difference in densities suggests that density may not be a good indicator of asteroid origin.|$|E
5|$|Greek mythology {{culminates in}} the <b>Trojan</b> War, fought between Greece and Troy, and its aftermath. In Homer's works, {{such as the}} Iliad, the chief stories have already taken shape and substance, and {{individual}} themes were elaborated later, especially in Greek drama. The <b>Trojan</b> War also elicited great interest in the Roman culture because {{of the story of}} Aeneas, a <b>Trojan</b> hero whose journey from Troy led to the founding of the city that would one day become Rome, as recounted in Virgil's Aeneid (Book II of Virgil's Aeneid contains the best-known account of the sack of Troy). Finally there are two pseudo-chronicles written in Latin that passed under the names of Dictys Cretensis and Dares Phrygius.|$|E

It begins when an elderly Kassandra tiredly agrees to correct the Homeric version of the <b>Trojan</b> War that is told by a {{traveling}} minstrel. Kassandra recounts her life experiences at Troy and Colchis, how she came to balk at the gender roles dictated by <b>Trojan</b> culture, and her inner turmoil over whether she should be serving the Goddess or Apollo.|$|E

5000|$|The {{unexpected}} high-inclination <b>trojans</b> {{are the key}} {{to understanding}} the origin and evolution of the population as a whole. The existence of high-inclination Neptune <b>trojans</b> points to a capture during planetary migration instead of in situ or collisional formation. The estimated equal number of large [...] and [...] <b>trojans</b> indicates that there was no gas drag during capture and points to a common capture mechanism for both [...] and [...] <b>trojans.</b> The capture of Neptune <b>trojans</b> during a migration of the planets occurs via process similar to the chaotic capture of Jupiter <b>trojans</b> in the Nice model. When Uranus and Neptune are near but not in a mean-motion resonance the locations where Uranus passes Neptune can circulate with a period that is in resonance with the libration periods of Neptune <b>trojans.</b> This results in repeated perturbations that increase the libration of existing <b>trojans</b> causing their orbits to become unstable. This process is reversible allowing new <b>trojans</b> to be captured when the planetary migration continues. For high-inclination <b>trojans</b> to be captured the migration must have been slow, or their inclinations must have been acquired previously.|$|R

5|$|The Trojans {{began the}} season by {{traveling}} to Hawaii {{to face the}} Warriors led by sixth–year head coach June Jones and quarterback Colt Brennan, Leinart's backup in high school. The Trojans opened the scoring on a 65-yard interception return by Darnell Bing. The Warriors answered with a field goal, however the Trojans scored 14points {{in the second quarter}} to take a 21–3 lead into half-time. After Leinart threw his second touchdown of the game to start the second half, Brennan was able to answer with his own touchdown pass to keep the deficit to 18, however, {{before the end of the}} quarter Leinart threw his third touchdown, Bush rushed for his second touchdown, and the <b>Trojan</b> defense returned a fumble for the fourth <b>Trojan</b> touchdown of the quarter. In the fourth quarter, most of the <b>Trojan</b> starters were out of the game, and backup quarterback John David Booty threw a touchdown to Dwayne Jarrett, his third touchdown catch of the game. Tyler Graunke threw a touchdown for the Warriors to bring them within 39, but backup running back Desmond Reed rushed for the last <b>Trojan</b> touchdown of the game to bring the final score to 63–17 and bringing the Trojans' win streak to 23games.|$|E

5000|$|Neptune <b>trojans</b> are {{bodies that}} orbit the Sun {{near one of}} the stable Lagrangian points of Neptune, similar to the <b>trojans</b> of other planets.

Seventeen Neptune <b>trojans</b> are currently known, of which thirteen orbit near the Sun-Neptune [...] Lagrangian point 60° ahead of Neptune and four orbit near Neptune's [...] region 60° behind Neptune. The Neptune <b>trojans</b> are termed 'trojans' by analogy with the Jupiter <b>trojans.</b>|$|R

5|$|Encrypting {{ransomware}} reappeared in September 2013 with a <b>Trojan</b> {{known as}} CryptoLocker, which generated a 2048-bit RSA key pair and uploaded {{in turn to}} a command-and-control server, and used to encrypt files using a whitelist of specific file extensions. The malware threatened to delete the private key if a payment of Bitcoin or a pre-paid cash voucher was not made within 3 days of the infection. Due to the extremely large key size it uses, analysts and those affected by the <b>Trojan</b> considered CryptoLocker extremely difficult to repair. Even after the deadline passed, the private key could still be obtained using an online tool, but the price would increase to 10 BTC—which cost approximately US$2300 as of November 2013.|$|E
5|$|For medieval writers, the {{two most}} {{influential}} ancient sources on the <b>Trojan</b> War were the purported eye-witness accounts of Dares the Phrygian, and Dictys the Cretan, which both survive in Latin versions. In Western Europe the <b>Trojan</b> side {{of the war was}} favoured and therefore Dares was preferred over Dictys. Although Dictys' account positions Troilus' death later in the war than was traditional, it conforms to antiquity's view of him as a minor warrior if one at all. Dares' De excidio Trojae historia (History of the Fall of Troy) introduces the character as a hero who takes part in events beyond the story of his death.|$|E
