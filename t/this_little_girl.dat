500|$|Daniels {{had said}} that he was {{attracted}} to the initial novel based on how [...] "raw and honest" [...] it felt. In an interview with AMC he noted that reading the book brought back a memory from his childhood of a young abused girl who knocked on his family's door, claiming that her mom was going to kill her. Daniels recalls that the incident {{was the first time he}} saw his mother frightened, specifically noting the helplessness of the situation, and stating [...] "she knew that she’d have to send <b>this</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> home, and that was what disturbed her— that she couldn’t save her. She tried to make it easier for her. That’s all she could do." [...] In creating the movie Daniels hoped that the experience would be cathartic and that [...] "maybe I could heal. And maybe I could heal other people, too." [...] Another stated goal Daniels had was to challenge the general public's perception of incest.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{the song}} [...] "Everyone's at It" [...] was {{announced}} {{to be released}} as the lead single from the album, but it was ultimately decided on [...] "The Fear". While discussing It's Not Me, It's You, Allen stated that her intention was to make [...] "bigger sounding, more ethereal songs, real songs. [...] I think I've grown up a bit {{as a person and}} I hope it reflects that." [...] She released a demo version of the song, which was then called [...] "I Don't Know", onto her Myspace account, along with another song, [...] "I Could Say", in April 2008. The singer declared about the inspiration for the song, which has to do with materialism and the pressures of being rich and famous: [...] tell you where the inspiration for it came from. I was walking down this street, in this village {{in the middle of the}} countryside in the U.K., and there was <b>this</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> who must have been eight or nine, walking down the street with her mum in, like, high-waisted hot pants and a little crop top. And I just thought, 'That's not really right.' And I could tell she was the kind of girl that would be trying out for Pop Idol in five years time, and wants to be famous when she grows up. And there's definitely the whole culture of that where I come from, and it's not necessarily a culture that I think is particularly healthy. But at the same time, I'm very aware that I am a part of that culture – but it's not something that I feel particularly comfortable with.|$|E

During this time Genji also meets the Lady Fujitsubo secretly, and she bears his son, Reizei. Everyone except the two lovers believes the father of the child is the Emperor Kiritsubo.

2500|$|Young Judy Garland, {{then known}} as Baby Frances Gumm, first auditioned on the Wilshire Ebell Theater stage, and was {{discovered}} while performing there. MGM producer George Sidney later described Garland's first audition this way: [...] "I had made Judy's first screen test. [...] There was a theater here in Los Angeles called the Wilshire-Ebell. ... hey used to put on vaudeville acts on certain nights of the week. [...] <b>This</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> came out with her two sisters and her mother playing the piano. [...] She did a little number with a baseball bat. [...] We took her out to the studio and made a test on a soundstage..." [...] And in his biography of Garland, Gerold Frank described an early performance on the Wilshire Ebell stage, witnessed by another MGM producer, Joseph L. Mankiewicz: [...] "Judy sang. And in his seat, Joe Mankiewicz, who was to win half a dozen Oscars as a screenwriter and director, underwent a memorable experience. [...] He sat transfixed. [...] Not only the power, but something electric ..." [...] Mankewicz met the 13-year-old Garland backstage at the Ebell and determined to bring her name to the studio's attention.|$|E
2500|$|Clarice {{is one of}} the escaped {{inmates and}} was {{originally}} intended to be an homage to Chop Top Sawyer, a character from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, but was later developed into her own character. Seth M. Sherwood stated that [...] "When you see her, you can see a little of that DNA in there", describing Chop Top as his favourite Sawyer. A revisionist take on Chop Top was added due to the diminished role of the family in earlier drafts of the script, but was removed when the filmmakers began to feel that she was more of a [...] "rip-off" [...] than a genuine tribute. The version of Clarice that appears in the final film emerged when Sherwood imagined [...] "an image of <b>this</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> in pigtails burning down her house with her parents inside". Out of all the performances in Leatherface, Sherwood called Jessica Madsen's the most accurate of what he envisioned while writing. Deciding that Clarice is [...] "much more than just a pyromaniac", Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo removed scenes detailing her backstory, such as her weaponising fire for the first time, her addiction for [...] "watching the flames dancing", and exposition on her family's disappearance. As the film begins, it remains ambiguous as to which inmate is actually Jedidiah Sawyer, the eventual Leatherface. Maury and Bustillo even considered leading the audience to believe that Clarice could become the titular character, [...] "It wasn’t a so crazy idea to have regarding the passion Leatherface had for dresses and makeup in the previous movies." ...|$|E

60|$|Now I {{must tell}} you that <b>this</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl,</b> {{although}} very sweet in many ways, had one serious fault. She was inclined to be a bit contrary, and put her own opinions and ideas before those of her elders.

60|$|And now I {{return to}} what I {{said at the}} beginning--that there were several reasons for {{including}} <b>this</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> in my series of impressions.
