40|$|Abstract. This article {{describes}} the flexibility and the potentials {{of the most important}} finish for aluminium-based materials. After a suggestion for the classification of anodizing processes, the historical development of the electrolytic anodic oxidation (EAO) and the plasma-electrolytic anodic oxidation (PAO) are presented. In the following section the focus is given on selected topics concerning the process parameters, the microstructure including the layer composition and properties. The variability of the anodizing process parameters and the used materials provide this variety of application. Furthermore, both differences and similarities of the EAO and PAO processes are shown. The conclusion of this review emphasizes that there is still some need for further research especially in the interaction of the process, the formed microstructure and <b>the</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>properties</b> determining the final application. Hence new possibilities for this surface treatment will be open...|$|E
40|$|Nanoparticles are {{efficiently}} {{produced by}} using plasma sources such spark and/or arc discharges*. The major {{advantage of this}} technique is {{in the possibility of}} using several discharges in parallel to increase the yield of particles. To better control over this process, numerical study of the mechanisms involved is required. Herein, we present the results of a detailed numerical modelling performed for copper. The model consists of several parts: (i) first, we consider streamer formation and propagation for a short gap spark discharge in Ar at atmospheric pressure. In this part, we investigate ionization kinetics and energy balance; (ii) as soon as a breakdown occurs, we investigate the heating of the electrodes and compare the evaporation flow with the amount of sputtered copper atoms; (iii) finally, we compare the amount of nanoparticles formed by nucleation with the number of particles formed due to ion bombardment. The calculation results agree with the available experimental findings and help us to elucidate general trends and to connect them with the involved mechanisms. The performed analysis shows how the experimental conditions are correlated with <b>the</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>properties</b> of nanoparticles. *EU project BUONAPART-E www. buonapart-e. e...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Polymeric {{particle}} composites which synergically combine {{properties of}} filler {{and of a}} matrix are of a great potential to satisfy a number of requirements of many branches by their resulted behaviour. Using surface mechanical treatment waste as the composite filler adds also a possibility of economical non-dangerous waste material recyclation way to <b>the</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>properties</b> of the formed material as {{the form of the}} fortifying phase of the particle composites. The experimental specimens filler (the fortifying phase) was waste from the process of machining and blasting. Its fraction differs from common particle filler by a large dimension and heterogenity of single particles. The two-component epoxy adhesive was used as the matrix (the connected phase). The influence of various fortifying phase coming from waste and composite mechanical properties changes depending on different filler volume portion was experimentally tested at the formed polymeric particle composite. Setting the polymeric particle composites behaviour is important for a definition of their application possibilities. It is supposed to use such systems in the sphere of puttying adhesive bondings or renovation of various materials and machine particles.

40|$|A {{composite}} {{is made up}} of {{two distinct}} materials and <b>the</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>properties</b> are different from the individual precursors. Composite combines a huge or bulkier element called matrix and reinforcement called filler or fiber. Fiber is added in the matrix to increase the stiffness of the matrix and enhance or alter its physical properties. Since silk has high levels of toughness, strength and multifunctional nature, we decided to use bombyx mori as a matrix. Because of the superior mechanical properties, i. e., high tensile moduli, and strength of carbon nanotube, we chose carbon nanotube as a reinforcement fiber to enhance the mechanical properties of resulting composite. The main issue encountered while preparing composite was to fully disperse individual nanotubes in the matrices, because nanotubes tend to form clusters and bundles. Hence, we used ionic liquids to dissolve the cocoon, and processed homogenization of FCNT with silk by sonication, stirring. For testing, different weight percentages of functionalized carbon nanotube were used as a filler to make the silk composite, and nanoindentation and tensile tester tested the samples. The composite of various concentrations did not show the expected result of increasing mechanical properties with decreased carbon nanotube concentration. Hence, it was concluded that a different method to functionalize carbon nanotube should be implemented...|$|E
