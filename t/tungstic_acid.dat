40|$|In {{this paper}} we compare two {{different}} reactions, {{aimed at the}} synthesis of 1, 2 -cyclohexanediol. Specifically: (a) the direct epoxidation and hydrolysis (dihydroxylation) of cyclohexene to trans- 1, 2 -cyclohexanediol, with an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide, and (b) the hydrogenation of catechol to a mixture of cis and trans- 1, 2 -cyclohexanediol, {{in an attempt to}} establish green protocols for the synthesis of diols. Both reactions, the dihydroxylation of cyclohexene and the hydrogenation of catechol, were carried out without organic solvents. In the former case, an unprecedented 97. 4 % yield to the glycol was obtained, by selecting proper reaction conditions and using a <b>tungstic</b> acid/phosphoric <b>acid</b> catalyst, in a biphasic system with a phase-transfer agent.

The electric discharge had a current of 5 mA and 1000 V at a pressure between 0.05 and 0.5 mm Hg for the helium. Functional electrolysis currents are from 2-20 mA, and 5-10 mA works best. The process works slowly at 200 V. and 0.02 mm Hg of mercury vapour accelerates tungsten evaporation by five times. The search for this was suggested by Ernest Rutherford. It was discredited by J. G.

50|$|Two more {{conductive}} {{materials that}} have notable characteristics are tungsten and indium tin oxide. Tungsten is electrically conductive {{and can be}} manufactured down to a very fine point, {{and for this reason}} has been used in intraspinal microstimulation (ISMS) for mapping out spinal cords during terminal surgeries. Tungsten electrodes, however, can corrode and form tungstic ions in the presence of H2O2 and/or O2. <b>Tungstic</b> <b>acid</b> has been seen to be highly toxic to cat motorneurons, and for this reason, does not currently make a suitable material for chronic implants. Indium tin oxide (ITO) has been used as electrode material for in vitro studies. ITO electrodes are very precise when stimulating and recording and when placed amongst plasma proteins, develop and maintain the thinnest protein layer compared to the other materials so far mentioned.

To further enhance the efficiency of <b>tungstic</b> <b>acid,</b> a series of additives were investigated in this work. Among various acid additives, H 2 SO 4 stands out as the most remarkable additive; ethylene glycol yield was enhanced from 32. 6 % to 52. 6 % at a H 2 SO 4 /H 2 WO 4 molar ratio of 0. 03 and a H 2 WO 4 /cellulose weight ratio of 0. 05, that is, an extremely dilute acid concentration. Weakly acidic sulfates (e. g., CuSO 4 and FeSO 4) have also been demonstrated to be highly efficient additives to improve the catalytic efficiency of <b>tungstic</b> <b>acid,</b> through promoting the hydrolysis of cellulose.
