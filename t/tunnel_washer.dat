50|$|A <b>tunnel</b> <b>washer,</b> {{also called}} a {{continuous}} batch washer, is an industrial laundry machine {{designed specifically to}} handle heavy loads.|$|E
5000|$|An {{industrial}} washer can {{be mounted}} on heavy-duty shock absorbers {{and attached to}} a concrete floor, {{so that it can}} extract water from even the most severely out-of-balance and heavy wash loads. Noise and vibration is not as unacceptable as in a domestic machine. It may be mounted on hydraulic cylinders, permitting the entire washer to be lifted and tilted so that fabrics can be automatically dumped from the wash drum onto a conveyor belt once the cycle is complete. [...] One special type of continuous-processing washer is known as the <b>tunnel</b> <b>washer.</b> This specialized high-capacity machine does not have a drum where everything being washed undergoes distinct wash and rinse cycles, but moves the laundry slowly and continuously through a long, large-diameter horizontal-axis rotating tube in the manner of an assembly line, with different processes at different positions.|$|E
50|$|At the start, {{one of the}} machine's major {{drawbacks}} was {{the necessity}} of using one wash formula for all items. Modern computerized <b>tunnel</b> <b>washers</b> can monitor and adjust the chemical levels in individual pockets, effectively overcoming this problem.|$|R
