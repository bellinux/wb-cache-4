5|$|Trescothick's 12 ODI {{hundreds}} are {{the most}} by an English cricketer, followed by Graham Gooch with eight, and current player Kevin Pietersen with seven. Trescothick passed Gooch's tally when he scored 100 not out against Bangladesh in his 100th ODI in 2005. This was also the fastest of his career, off 76 balls, the third fastest ODI century for an English batsman. Trescothick made his first ODI century against Pakistan, scoring a career-best 137. His century the following year against India in {{the final of the}} 2002 NatWest Series, along with two fifties earlier in the competition, saw him named Man of the Series. He was again named Man of the Series in the 2003 NatWest Challenge, finishing the three-match series with a century, a fifty and more <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> runs as any other player. Only six days later, captaining his side against South Africa, Trescothick scored another century and, alongside fellow opener Vikram Solanki, set an English record first wicket partnership of 200. His ODI hundreds have been made against 10 different opponents, on seven different grounds. Six of his centuries have been scored in London, equally split between The Oval and Lord's.|$|E
50|$|Some {{functional}} {{classes of}} genes {{are more likely}} to be bidirectionally paired than others. Genes implicated in DNA repair are five times more likely to be regulated by bidirectional promoters than by unidirectional promoters. Chaperone proteins are three times more likely, and mitochondrial genes are more <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> likely. <b>Many</b> basic housekeeping and cellular metabolic genes are regulated by bidirectional promoters.The overrepresentation of bidirectionally paired DNA repair genes associates these promoters with cancer. Forty-five percent of human somatic oncogenes seem to be regulated by bidirectional promoters - significantly more than non-cancer causing genes. Hypermethylation of the promoters between gene pairs WNT9A/CD558500, CTDSPL/BC040563, and KCNK15/BF195580 has been associated with tumors.|$|R

Genetic diversity was higher in indica than japonica accessions both in 14 PSH and 20 GSH accessions, revealed by parameters reflecting nucleotide segregation at total polymorphic sites and silent sites, πT, θT, πsil, and θsil (Table  2, Fig.  4).

40|$|Efficacy of two low volume bowel {{cleansing}} preparations, {{polyethylene glycol}} plus ascorbate (PEG + Asc) and sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate (NaPic/MgCit), were compared for polyp and adenoma detection rate (PDR and ADR) and overall cleansing ability. Primary endpoint was PDR (the {{number of patients}} with ≥ 1 polypoid or flat lesion recorded by the colonoscopist). Diagnostic, surveillance or screening colonoscopy patients were enrolled into this investigator-blinded, multi-center Phase IV study and randomized 1 : 1 to receive PEG + Asc (administered the evening before and the morning of colonoscopy, per label) or NaPic/MgCit (administered {{in the morning and}} afternoon the day before colonoscopy, per label). The blinded colonoscopist documented any lesion and assessed cleansing quality (Harefield Cleansing Scale). Of 394 patients who completed the study, 393 (PEG + Asc, N = 200; NaPic/MgCit, N = 193) had a colonoscopy. Overall PDR for PEG+Asc versus NaPic/MgCit was 51. 5 % versus 44. 0 %, p = 0. 139. PDR and ADR {{on the right side of}} the bowel were significantly higher with PEG + Asc versus NaPic/MgCit (PDR: 56 [28. 0 %] versus 32 [16. 6 %], p = 0. 007; ADR: 42 [21. 0 %] versus 23 [11. 9 %], p = 0. 015), as was detection of flat lesions (43 [21. 5 %] versus 25 [13. 0 %], p = 0. 025). Cleansing quality was better with PEG + Asc than NaPic/MgCit (98. 5 % versus 57. 5 % considered successful cleansing). Overall, there were 132 treatment-emergent adverse events (93 versus 39 for PEG+Asc and NaPic/MgCit, respectively). These were mainly mild abdominal symptoms, all of which were reported for higher proportions of patients in the PEG+Asc <b>than</b> NaPic/MgCit group. <b>Twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> patients in the NaPic/MgCit versus the PEG + Asc group reported tolerance of cleansing solution as 'very good'. Compared with NaPic/MgCit, PEG + Asc may be more efficacious for overall cleansing ability, and subsequent detection of right-sided and flat lesions. This is likely attributable to the different administration schedules of the two bowel cleansing preparations, which may positively impact the detection and prevention of colorectal cancer, thereby improving mortality rates.

40|$|Twenty-one Catholic Italian divorcees and a matched {{group of}} twenty-one Catholic Anglophone divorcees (who {{were born in}} Canada and whose ethnic roots were in Great Britain) were studied to {{determine}} ethnic differences in family concept, family interaction, sex role orientation, and social support. Results showed that Italian fathers, but not mothers, disapproved of the divorce significantly more than Anglophone fathers. Parental approval/disapproval of the divorce {{was found to have}} a greater effect on the support received by Italian divorcees than Anglophone divorcees. Parental disapproval of the divorce was associated with less family and relative support for Italian divorcees only. Italian divorcees reported a more extended family experience <b>than</b> Anglophone divorcees. <b>Twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> Italian <b>as</b> Anglophone divorcees reported having had family or relatives living with them when they were growing up. Italian divorcees also reported greater family loyalty than Anglophone divorcees. They visited their parents significantly more than Anglophone divorcees and although not statistically significant, Italian divorcees telephoned their parents more frequently than Anglophone divorcees. Results indicated that Italian divorcees have a more extended concept of family, as opposed to nuclear, than Anglophone divorcees. They included more extended family members such as grandparents, aunts, and uncles, in their family than Anglophone divorcees. No {{differences were found between the}} two groups in terms of density of social support network. Almost no correlation was found between density and satisfaction for Anglophone divorcees, but an inverse correlation between these two variables was found for Italian Divorcees. Anglophones received more emotional support outside the family and were slightly more satisfied with the emotional support they received than Italian divorcees. No significant differences were found for: material help, advice, approval, tangible help, or social recreation between the two ethnic groups on outside family support. No ethnic differences were found between the two groups on sex role orientation. Both groups scored nontraditional on the Sex Role Attitude Scale. It was recommended that more emphasis be placed on the social support aspect of networks for divorcees. It was also recommended that more research be conducted in the area of kinship interaction after divorce, particularly with Italians. Italians seem to have a more extended family, yet they seem to receive less support from their family and relatives and are somewhat less satisfied with the support they do receive than Anglophones. Furthermore, they receive less support from outside the family members than Anglophone divorcees. Thus, were do Italian divorcees go for support? This is an area that needs more investigation since more Italians are getting divorced...|$|R
