5|$|Myers {{realised}} that normal, globe-shaped hot {{air passenger}} balloons {{were subject to}} <b>the</b> <b>whim</b> <b>of</b> {{the direction of the}} winds. He then thought that perhaps a passenger balloon could be controlled somehow to move against the flow. His first step in an evolution to a controllable balloon was the design of a large elongated spindle instead of a sphere. His theory was that a symmetrical wave line spindle body would have less head resistance when passing through the air than did a blunt globe.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} now {{incorporated into}} El Salvador was not politically unified {{at the time}} of Spanish contact. As with neighbouring regions, this hindered the progress of incorporation into the Spanish Empire, as each small kingdom had to be overcome in turn; this contrasted with Mexico where a large empire had been rapidly overcome with the fall of its capital, Tenochtitlan. As Spanish authority gradually spread out from Mexico and Panama, this left El Salvador in an intermediate region temporarily beyond Spanish control. Spanish colonial towns were founded according to <b>the</b> <b>whim</b> <b>of</b> individual conquistadors, with no formal planning of their location or of communication routes between them, often leaving them isolated. In 1548, El Salvador was formally placed within the jurisdiction of the Audiencia Real of Guatemala, which extended along the Central American isthmus from Chiapas, now in southern Mexico, to Costa Rica.|$|E
5|$|At {{the head}} of Macedonia's {{government}} was the king (basileus). From at least the reign of Philip II the king was assisted by the royal pages (basilikoi paides), bodyguards (somatophylakes), companions (hetairoi), friends (philoi), an assembly that included members of the military, and magistrates during the Hellenistic period. Evidence is lacking for {{the extent to which}} each of these groups shared authority with the king or if their existence had a basis in a formal constitutional framework. Before the reign of Philip II, the only institution supported by textual evidence is the monarchy. In 1931, Friedrich Granier was the first to propose that by the time of Philip II's reign, Macedonia had a constitutional government with laws that delegated rights and customary privileges to certain groups, especially to its citizen soldiers, although the majority of evidence for the army's alleged right to appoint a new king and judge cases of treason stems from the reign of Alexander III of Macedon. Pietro de Francisci was the first to refute these ideas and advance the theory that the Macedonian government was an autocracy ruled by <b>the</b> <b>whim</b> <b>of</b> the monarch, although this issue of kingship and governance is still unresolved in academia.|$|E

25|$|The colonists {{had several}} {{problems}} with these writs. They were permanent and even transferable; the holder of a writ could assign it to another.

25|$|Cassiodorus's {{legacy is}} quietly profound. Before the {{founding}} of Vivarium, the copying of manuscripts had been a task reserved for either inexperienced or physically infirm devotees, and was performed at <b>the</b> <b>whim</b> <b>of</b> literate monks. Through the influence of Cassiodorus, the monastic system adopted a more vigorous, widespread, and regular approach to reproducing documents within the monastery. This approach {{to the development of}} the monastic lifestyle was perpetuated especially through German religious institutions.|$|E
25|$|The Peerage, still, {{was not an}} {{hereditary}} body. Kings did {{not consider}} themselves, having once summoned an individual, bound to summon the same individual, much less his heirs, to future Parliaments. Thus, writs were issued at <b>the</b> <b>whim</b> <b>of</b> the King. Over time, however, the arbitrary power of the Crown was fettered by the principles of hereditary right. At first, the writ of summons {{was regarded as a}} burden and interference, but later, when Parliament's power increased, it was seen as a sign of royal favour. Since the Crown was itself an hereditary dignity, it seemed natural for seats in the upper House of Parliament to be so as well. By the beginning of the fourteenth century, the Peerage had evolved its hereditary characteristics. Since under Norman customs, estates devolved under the principles of primogeniture, seats in Parliament did so as well.|$|E

25|$|The 17th century, {{called the}} 'Great Century' by the French, was {{anything}} but great for {{the inhabitants of the}} Southern Netherlands. During this period, this region went through a succession of wars and destruction, exacerbated by large armies traversing the region at <b>the</b> <b>whim</b> <b>of</b> the great powers. In 1695, nearly forty years after the Battle of the Dunes of 1658, France began its policy of territorial expansion. This expansion resulted in the gradual annexation of Spanish possessions to France's north. Wars were fought and alliances made and broken, and fortresses continuously changed hands. The Nine Years' War had been raging since 1688. Opposing France was a large European coalition, the Grand Alliance, with its head as William III of Orange, leader of the Netherlands, and soon to be king of England. Alongside William stood Spain, Sweden, the Holy Roman Empire as well several electors, among them Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, governor of the Spanish Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|By 1983 {{the fleet}} {{included}} seven aircraft, two Boeing 727-100s (the second was registered C2-RN7) and five Boeing 737-200s (C2-RN5, 'RN6, 'RN8 and 'RN9 having {{been added to}} the fleet); since the entire population of Nauru at this time was about 8,000, the airline was in the extraordinary position of having seating capacity equal to 10% of the Nauruan population. The airline also had a bad reputation for cancelling flights at <b>the</b> <b>whim</b> <b>of</b> its government owners, including using the Boeing 727s for low-level searches for Nauruan fisherman lost at sea while relatives on board were served alcohol by the flight attendants. From this high point (at least in terms of fleet numbers) the airline gradually contracted in size, leasing some aircraft and selling others. Five years later in 1988 the fleet consisted of three Boeing 737-200s with the one remaining 727-100 leased out to Trans Australia Airlines. At this time the airline was badly affected by an industrial dispute with its pilots and was operating without a set timetable, a situation that lasted for several months.|$|E

25|$|Government Salt Superintendents also {{accumulated}} fortunes. They could under-report {{tax revenues}} {{and keep the}} difference for themselves; they could accept fees from applicants for office; or, with a clear conscience, simply accept gifts from salt merchants who were grateful for their help. A good example is Cao Yin (1658-1711). As a personal bondservant and childhood playmate of the Kangxi Emperor, Cao became so rich and influential that he played host four times to the Emperor in his tours of the south. In 1705, as a mark of favor, the emperor ordered Cao, an accomplished scholar, to compile all shi (lyric poems) surviving from the Tang dynasty. Cao compiled and published the Complete Poems of the Tang using proceeds from the Salt Administration. Yet even such a well-connected official relied on <b>the</b> <b>whim</b> <b>of</b> the emperor. The Cao family lost favor and fortune when a new emperor came to the throne, a fall from grace reflected in Dream of the Red Chamber, the nostalgic novel written by Cao Yin's grandson Cao Xueqin.|$|E

500|$|Robinson's {{presence}} was controversial in racially charged Florida. As {{he was not}} allowed to stay with his teammates at the team hotel, he lodged instead at the home of a local black politician. Since the Dodgers organization did not own a spring training facility (the Dodger-controlled spring training compound in Vero Beach known as [...] "Dodgertown" [...] did not open until spring 1948), scheduling was subject to <b>the</b> <b>whim</b> <b>of</b> area localities, several of which turned down any event involving Robinson or Johnny Wright, another black player whom Rickey had signed to the Dodgers' organization in January. In Sanford, Florida, the police chief threatened to cancel games if Robinson and Wright did not cease training activities there; as a result, Robinson was sent back to Daytona Beach. In Jacksonville, the stadium was padlocked shut without warning on game day, by order of the city's Parks and Public Property director. In DeLand, a scheduled day game was postponed, ostensibly because of issues with the stadium's electrical lighting.|$|E
500|$|Although {{science fiction}} had been {{published}} before the 1920s, it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of Amazing Stories, a pulp magazine published by Hugo Gernsback.

[...] In 1938 Abraham and Martin Goodman, two brothers who owned a publishing company with multiple imprints, launched Marvel Science Stories, edited by Robert O. Erisman.

[...] The cover for the first issue was painted by Frank R. Paul, a popular cover artist recently returned to the science fiction field; Norman Saunders provided the second cover. [...] Dynamics sister magazine, Marvel Science Stories, often published stories with more sexual content than was usual for science fiction magazines of the day, but, although Dynamics advertising included books offering sexual advice, the magazine's actual content was more traditional pulp material.
