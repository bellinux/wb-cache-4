50|$|<b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{is one of}} {{the more}} devastating {{diseases}} affecting the shrimp farming industry worldwide.|$|E
50|$|<b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> (TS) {{was first}} {{described}} in Ecuador {{during the summer}} of 1992. In March 1993, it returned as a major epidemic and was the object of extensive media coverage. Retrospective studies have suggested a case of <b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> might have occurred on a shrimp farm in Colombia as early as 1990 and the virus was already present in Ecuador in mid-1991. Between 1992 and 1997, the disease spread to all major regions of the Americas where whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) is cultured. The economic impact of TS in the Americas during that period might have exceeded US$2 billion by some estimates.|$|E
50|$|The Taura River is a {{river of}} Ecuador. It flows into the Churute Estuary in the Gulf of Guayaquil. It gives {{its name to the}} shrimp disease <b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome,</b> which was first {{described}} in shrimp farms along the river.|$|E
50|$|<b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{virus was}} first {{classified}} as a possible {{member of the family}} Picornaviridae based on biological and physical characteristics. It was later reclassified in the Dicistroviridae family, genus Cripavirus. It has since been reassigned to a second genus in the same family - the Aparavirus.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Jim Brock, {{the aquatic}} disease {{specialist}} for the State of Hawaii during this period, first demonstrated the disease could be transmitted by feeding Taura victims to healthy shrimp in early 1994. The dying test shrimp were then fed to {{a new set of}} shrimp, which was dying at the same rate. Rivers' postulates were fulfilled in 1994 by Dr. Ken Hasson and co-researchers at the University of Arizona. This proved the viral etiology of the syndrome. The virus was named <b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> virus, often referred to as TSV. The virus is referred to by the name infectious cuticular epithelial necrosis virus (ICENV) by some authors in Latin America. <b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a notifiable disease by the Office international des Épizooties (OIE), which reflects the serious nature and devastating impact of the disease.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{can spread}} rapidly when {{introduced}} in new areas. A shrimp farmer described the 1995 outbreak in Texas as, [...] "This thing spread like a forest fire... There was no stopping it. I {{just sat there}} and watched it and {{in a matter of}} three days, my shrimp were gone. Dead!" ...|$|E

The color of healthy shrimp {{is determined by the}} color of the plankton, the type of soil at the pond bottom, and the additional nutrients used. The white color of the shrimp at the bottom is due to the TSV infection.|$|E
50|$|<b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{was first}} {{reported}} from shrimp farms on the Taura river in Ecuador in 1992. The {{host of the}} virus causing the disease is P. vannamei, {{one of the two}} most commonly farmed shrimp. The disease spread rapidly, mainly through the shipping of infected animals and broodstock. Originally confined to farms in the Americas, it has also been propagated to Asian shrimp farms with the introduction of L. vannamei there. Birds are thought to be a route of infection between farms within one region.|$|E
50|$|In January 1994, at {{the request}} of Ciba-Geigy, a {{workshop}} on <b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> was held at the Aquaculture Pathology Laboratory of the University of Arizona. Experts from several countries with expertise in shrimp and insect pathology, shrimp nutrition, toxicology, myocology, water quality and farm management participated in the workshop. Industry representatives also participated. The group developed recommendations as to the standardization of the research on TS and suggested that studies be done to evaluate whether fungicides or as-yet unrecognized agents were responsible for the syndrome.|$|E
50|$|During the 20th century, L. vannamei was an {{important}} species for Mexican inshore fishermen, {{as well as for}} trawlers further offshore. In the late 20th century, the wild fishery was overtaken by the use of aquaculture; this began in 1973 in Florida using prawns captured in Panama. In Latin America, the culture of L. vannamei showed peaks of production during the warm El Niño years, and reduced production during the cooler La Niña years, due to the effects of disease. Production of L. vannamei is limited by its susceptibility to various diseases, including white spot syndrome, <b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome,</b> infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis, baculoviral midgut gland necrosis and Vibrio infections. By 2004, global production of L. vannamei approached 1,116,000 t, and exceeded that of Penaeus monodon.|$|E
50|$|The chronic {{phase is}} first seen {{six days after}} {{infection}} and persist for at least 12 months under experimental conditions. This phase is characterized histologically {{by the absence of}} acute lesions and the presence of LOS of successive morphologies. These LOSs are positive by ISH for TSV. A low prevalence of ectopic spheroids can also be observed in some cases. LOSs are not by themselves characteristic of TSV infection and can be found in other viral diseases of shrimp such as lymphoid organ vacuolization virus (LOVV), lymphoid parvo-like virus (LPV), lymphoid organ virus (LOV), rhabdovirus of penaeid shrimp (RPS) and yellowhead virus (YHV). Diagnosis of the disease during the chronic phase is problematic, as shrimp do not display any outward signs of the disease and do not show mortality from the infection. Survivors may become carriers for life. Shrimp with chronic TSV infection are not as vigorous as uninfected shrimp, as demonstrated by their inability to tolerate a salinity drop as well as uninfected shrimp. A 2011 study by Laxminath Tumburu looked at the relationship between an environmental stressor (pesticide Endosulfan) and <b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> virus (TSV) and their interactions on the susceptibility and molting of marine penaeid shrimp L. vannamei and found the interference of endosulfan-associated stress led to increasingly higher susceptibility at postmolt stage during the acute phase of the TSV disease cycle.|$|E
50|$|Selection {{for growth}} in Penaeid shrimps yielded {{successful}} results. A selective breeding program for Litopenaeus stylirostris saw an 18% increase in growth after the fourth generation and 21% growth after the fifth generation. Marsupenaeus japonicas showed a 10.7% increase in growth {{after the first}} generation. Argue et al. (2002) conducted a selective breeding program on the Pacific White Shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei at The Oceanic Institute, Waimanalo, USA from 1995 to 1998. They reported significant responses to selection compared to the unselected control shrimps. After one generation, a 21% increase was observed in growth and 18.4% increase in survival to TSV. The <b>Taura</b> <b>Syndrome</b> Virus (TSV) causes mortalities of 70% or more in shrimps. C.I. Oceanos S.A. in Colombia selected {{the survivors of the}} disease from infected ponds and used them as parents for the next generation. They achieved satisfying results in two or three generations wherein survival rates approached levels before the outbreak of the disease. The resulting heavy losses (up to 90%) caused by Infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) caused a number of shrimp farming industries started to selectively breed shrimps resistant to this disease. Successful outcomes led to development of Super Shrimp, a selected line of L. stylirostris that is resistant to IHHNV infection. Tang et al. (2000) confirmed this by showing no mortalities in IHHNV- challenged Super Shrimp post larvae and juveniles.|$|E

40|$|Crustaceans, {{specifically}} the cultured penaeid shrimp, are {{adversely affected by}} a number of diseases. Crustacean diseases that have significant social or economic impact on culture are mostly infectious in nature and many of them have no therapeutic remedies or treatments. There are currently 8 diseases of crustaceans listed by the OIE, seven of which are viral diseases of penaeid shrimp. This summary discusses two of the most important viral diseases in penaeid shrimp, white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) and <b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> virus (TSV) ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> disease, {{caused by}} <b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> virus (TSV), {{is one of}} the most {{important}} viral diseases of penaeid shrimp in the Western Hemisphere. A 3278 bp eDNA representing the 3 ' end of the TSV genome was cloned and sequenced. Sequence analyses revealed a 5 '-terminal 19 non -coding bases followed by a long open reading frame encoding 10 11 amino acids (aa), and a 3 ' untranslated region of 225 nts. The deduced aa sequence of TSV showed significant similarities with those of the coat proteins of several insect picomaviruses. A single transcript of approximately 10 kb was detected by Northern blot hybridization suggesting that the TSV coat protein gene is not expressed as a subgenomic RNA. The genome organization ofTSV is similar to insect picornaviruses. Therefore, this is the first molecular evidence of occurrence of a picomavirus in the class Decapoda. The putative VP 2 and VP 3 capsid protein genes ofTSV from 17 geographical isolates collected from US, Mexico and Taiwan were amplified by RT-PCR to assess the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships among isolates. Alignment of the capsid proteins showed nonconservative changes that may be involved in antigenicity and/ or virulence of the isolates. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the TSV isolates clustered in two main groups, one Mexican group and one mixed group of Mexican, Taiwan and Texas isolates indicating a shared phylogenetic relationship and a possible common origin...|$|E
40|$|<b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> virus (TSV) affects shrimp cultured {{for human}} consumption. Although TSV {{is related to}} the Cricket Paralysis virus, it belongs to the “picornavirus superfamily, ” {{the most common cause of}} viral illnesses. Here we {{demonstrate}} that TSV also infects human cell lines, which may suggest that Penaeus is a potential reservoir of this virus. T he <b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> virus (TSV) causes a disease affecting penaeid shrimp, the most important commercial family of crustaceans (1). The causal agent is a single-stranded (+) RNA virus, recently reported to be genomically related to the Cricket Paralysis virus of the Cripavirus genus, family Dicistroviridae of the “picornavirus superfamily ” (2 – 5). This superfamily includes several human pathogens, for example, the common cold viruses and several enteroviruses (e. g., polioviruses). Traditionally, research on the replication of shrimp viruses has been based on the use of cultured fish cellular lines (6). However, because TSV could potentially represent a public health threat, we explored whether this viral agent might be capable of infecting cultured mammalian cells. The Study Since Sabin strain LSc 2 ab (Sabin 1), the poliovirus used for human vaccination, is usually replicated in monolayer culture cells of human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD), human larynx carcinoma (Hep- 2 C), or Buffalo green monkey kidney (BGM) (7), we injected these cell lines with a 0. 22 -µm membrane-filtered whole extract of the hepatopancreas of shrimp (Penaeus stylirostris) affected with TSV. The animals were collected from farms located in northwestern Mexico. Control cell lines were injected with filtered hepatopancreas extracts fro...|$|E
40|$|Vertebrates mount {{a strong}} innate immune {{response}} against viruses, largely by activating the interferon system. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a common intermediate formed {{during the life}} cycle of many viruses, is a potent trigger of this response. In contrast, no general inducible antiviral defense mechanism has been reported in any invertebrate. Here we show that dsRNA induces antiviral protection in the marine crustacean Litopenaeus vannamei. When treated with dsRNA, shrimp showed increased resistance to infection by two unrelated viruses, white spot syndrome virus and <b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> virus. Induction of this antiviral state is independent of the sequence of the dsRNA used and therefore distinct from the sequence-specific dsRNA-mediated genetic interference phenomenon. This demonstrates {{for the first time that}} an invertebrate immune system, like its vertebrate counterparts, can recognize dsRNA as a virus-associated molecular pattern, resulting in the activation of an innate antiviral response...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{signs and}} lesions of <b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> virus (TSV) {{infection}} in Penaeus monodon were investigated by histological and {{in situ hybridization}} (ISH) analyses. Mortality among P. monodon inoculated with 2 genotypic variants of TSV (Th 04 Pm and Th 04 Lv) appeared on Day 3, with 2 out of 10 shrimp dying. Severe necrosis of cuticular epithelial cells and lymphoid organ spheroids, indicative of acute and chronic phase lesions of TSV infection, respectively, were detected in the samples. Both Th 04 Pm and Th 04 Lv belonged to a phylogenetic family of Asian TSV isolates. The results demonstrate that both mortality and histological lesions are associated with TSV infection in P. monodon. Infection with 4 genotypic variants of TSV (Bz 01, Th 04, UsHi 94, and Ve 05) in TSV-resistant (TSR) and TSV-susceptible (Kona) Litopenaeus vannamei was investigated. Survival probabilities of TSR shrimp were higher than those for Kona shrimp with all 4 variants. Th 04, UsHi 94, and Ve 05 gave no <b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> lesions with TSR shrimp. In contrast, TSR shrimp challenged with Bz 01 and Kona shrimp with all 4 TSV variants exhibited severe necrosis of cuticular epithelial cells and lymphoid organ spheroids. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed that mean TSV copy numbers in TSR shrimp infected with Bz 01, Th 04, and UsHi 94 were significantly (p 0. 4). The results show that TSR L. vannamei are susceptible to infection but give high survival rates following challenge by all 4 variants of TSV. To identify the viral replication site within shrimp infected cells, the viral RNA was located in association with virus-induced membrane rearrangement by electron microscopic ISH. Ultrastructure in the infected cells, analyzed by transmission electron microscopy, included the induction and proliferation of intracellular vesicle-like membranes, while the intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies and pyknotic nuclei were frequently seen. TSV RNA and TSV particles {{were found to be}} associated with the membranous structures. The results suggest that the proliferating membranes carry the RNA replication complex and that they are the site of nascent viral RNA synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Teasing {{apart the}} {{evolutionary}} forces responsible for biological phenomena is {{difficult in the}} absence of a detailed evolutionary history, especially if this history is lacking a temporal component. RNA viruses, due to their rapid rate of molecular and phenotypic evolution, provide a unique biological system in which to study the temporal aspects of evolutionary processes. These types of studies are possible because of relaxed molecular clock dating techniques, which allow the rate of evolution to vary across a phylogenetic tree. The primary focus of the research presented here concerns the age of the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), the primate precursor to HIV. SIV has long been thought to be an ancient infection in non-human African primates, and it has been hypothesized that codivergence with its primate hosts has shaped the SIV phylogeny and resulted in a virus capable of apathogenic infection. The codivergence theory was tested by comparing the phylogeny of a group of monkeys thought to be exemplary of SIV-host codivergence to the phylogeny of their SIVs (Appendix A). These phylogenies were incongruent, suggesting that SIV may have infected these monkeys after their common ancestor speciated. The codivergence theory was investigated further by estimating the time of most recent common ancestor for the SIV lineages that directly gave rise to HIV, found in sooty mangabeys and chimpanzees (Appendix B). The temporal estimates suggest that these SIV lineages are only of hundreds of years old, much younger than expected under the codivergence hypothesis. Next, the same dating techniques were employed to elucidate the evolutionary history of an emerging RNA virus of shrimp, <b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> virus (Appendix C). This analysis provided phylogenetic confirmation that <b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> virus emerged out of the Americas and spread rapidly around the world. Finally, because all of these studies utilized relaxed molecular clocks, a simulation study was performed to test the hypothesis that relaxed molecular clocks provide higher quality phylogenetic inference compared with traditional time-free phylogenetic inference (Appendix D). This simulation found no difference in the overall quality of phylogenetic inference between these methods...|$|E
40|$|<b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> virus (TSV), a {{pathogen}} of {{penaeid shrimp}} {{and member of}} the family Dicistroviridae, was recently reported {{to have the ability to}} infect primate cells. We independently retested this hypothesis. Three lines of primate cells FRhK- 4, MA- 104, and BGMK, which are highly susceptible to infection by human picornaviruses, were challenged with TSV. Viral replication was assayed by realtime reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction using cell media samples collected on days 0, 4, and 7 postchallenge. By day 7, genome copy numbers had decreased 25 %– 99 %. No cytopathic effect was observed after 7 days. An in situ hybridization assay, with gene probes specific for detection of TSV, was negative for TSV in challenged cells. The infectivity of residual virus in the cell culture media at day 7 was confirmed by bioassay using TSV-free indicator shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). TSV did not infect the primate cells tested, and no evidence of zoonotic potential was found. The general assumption is that the viral agents that cause disease in penaeid shrimp do not infect vertebrates. Supporting this assumption is the absence of documented cases of any shrimp virus causing disease in any animal species other than crustaceans. In a recent article, <b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> virus (TSV), exclusively a pathogen of penaeid shrimp, was attributed a zoonotic potential because of its reported ability to infect cultured human and monkey cells (1). Aside from the food safety issues raised by this report, we were very interested in confirming those results because of the practical value of this new option for growing TSV in vitro. To date, TSV (or any other of the known viruses of the penaeid shrimp) has not yet been successfully cultured in any invertebrate or vertebrate cellculture system. Hence, if viable, the use of primate cells for propagation of TSV would prove to be an important advancement in the study of TSV, and perhaps of other crustacean viruses. While the experiment reported in this study did not include all of the cell lines used by Audelodel-Valle et al. (1), namely human rhabdomyosarcom...|$|E
40|$|Internal {{ribosome}} entry sites (IRESs) mediate cap-independent {{translation of}} viral mRNAs. Using electron cryo-microscopy {{of a single}} specimen, we present five ribosome structures formed with the <b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> virus IRES and translocase eEF 2 *GTP bound with sordarin. The structures suggest a trajectory of IRES translocation, required for translation initiation, and provide an unprecedented view of eEF 2 dynamics. The IRES rearranges from extended to bent to extended conformations. This inchworm-like movement is coupled with ribosomal inter-subunit rotation and 40 S head swivel. eEF 2, attached to the 60 S subunit, slides along the rotating 40 S subunit to enter the A site. Its diphthamide-bearing tip at domain IV separates the tRNA-mRNA-like pseudoknot I (PKI) of the IRES from the decoding center. This unlocks 40 S domains, facilitating head swivel and biasing IRES translocation via hitherto-elusive intermediates with PKI captured between the A and P sites. The structures suggest missing links {{in our understanding of}} tRNA translocation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In {{aquaculture}} breeding, {{resistance against}} infectious diseases is commonly assessed as time until death under {{exposure to a}} pathogen. For some diseases, {{a fraction of the}} individuals may appear as "cured" (non-susceptible), and the resulting survival time may thus be a result of two confounded underlying traits, i. e., endurance (individual hazard) and susceptibility (whether at risk or not), which may be accounted for by fitting a cure survival model. We applied a cure model to survival data of Pacific white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) challenged with the <b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> virus, {{which is one of the}} major pathogens of Panaeid shrimp species. Methods In total, 15, 261 individuals of 513 full-sib families from three generations were challenge-tested in 21 separate tests (tanks). All challenge-tests were run until mortality naturally ceased. Time-until-event data were analyzed with a mixed cure survival model using Gibbs sampling, treating susceptibility and endurance as separate genetic traits. Results Overall mortality at the end of test was 28 %, while 38 % of the population was considered susceptible to the disease. The estimated underlying heritability was high for susceptibility (0. 41 ± 0. 07), but low for endurance (0. 07 ± 0. 03). Furthermore, endurance and susceptibility were distinct genetic traits (r g = 0. 22 ± 0. 25). Estimated breeding values for endurance and susceptibility were only moderately correlated (0. 50), while estimated breeding values from classical models for analysis of challenge-test survival (ignoring the cured fraction) were closely correlated with estimated breeding values for susceptibility, but less correlated with estimated breeding values for endurance. Conclusions For <b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> resistance, endurance and susceptibility are apparently distinct genetic traits. However, genetic evaluation of susceptibility based on the cure model showed clear associations with standard genetic evaluations that ignore the cure fraction for these data. Using the current testing design, genetic variation in observed survival time and absolute survival at the end of test were most likely dominated by genetic variation in susceptibility. If the aim is to reduce susceptibility, earlier termination of the challenge-test or back-truncation of the follow-up period should be avoided, as this may shift focus of selection towards endurance rather than susceptibility. </p...|$|E
40|$|These {{studies were}} begun {{during the summer}} of 1994, W 2 years after the {{recognition}} of <b>Taura</b> <b>Syndrome</b> (TS), a lethal disease of farm-raised Penaeus vannamei in Ecuador of then unknown etiology. Utilizing specific pathogen free (SPF) P. vannamei test shrimp, the combined results of four initial TS bioassays suggested that the disease had an infectious instead of a toxic etiology as originally reported. The hypothesis that TS was virus-caused prompted the application of a shrimp parvovirus (IHHNV) purification protocol, which resulted in the discovery of <b>Taura</b> <b>Syndrome</b> virus (TSV), a previously unrecognized virus that was isolated from TS diseased shrimp tissues. Three serial infectivity studies were performed in which purified cell-free extracts of TSV were injected into SPF P. vannamei test shrimp and the criteria of Rivers' postulates were fulfilled, establishing that TS has a viral etiology. In situ hybridization assays for the detection of TSV resulted in frequent false negative gene probe results. This problem was due to fixative-induced acid hydrolysis of the TSV RNA genome resulting from tissue fixation with Davidson's solution (pH 3. 5 - 4). Development and use of a neutral fixative, R-F (RNA-Friendly) fixative, was shown to prevent this problem. The pathogenesis of TSV lesions was analyzed in experimentally infected, time course sampled SPF P. vannamei. The TSV disease cycle was found to consist of three clinically and histologically distinct overlapping phases; an W 7 d acute phase, an W 5 d transition phase and a long term cyclic chronic phase of at least 8 months duration. TSV susceptibility studies of two endemic North American (P. setiferus and P. aztecus) and one Asian penaeid species (P. chinensis) showed that P. aztecus and P. chinensis juveniles were susceptible, whereas, P. setiferus appeared refractory to TSV infection. The geographic range of TSV within the Americas was documented based on gene probe and histological findings of archived P. vannamei samples dating from 1992 to 1996. TSV was detectable within P. vannamei submitted from Ecuador when the disease was first recognized (1992) and has since spread into 12 other countries. The causes and effects of the international controversy of a viral versus a toxic etiology for TS are discussed and a solution offered to prevent similar disputes in the future...|$|E
40|$|<b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> (TS) {{is one of}} {{the most}} devastating {{diseases}} affecting the shrimp farming industry worldwide. The causative virus, <b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> virus (TSV), has been identified. My work is centred on the development of monoclonal antibodies against TSV. I have also characterized a novel variant of the virus from Venezuela and evaluated the effect of hyperthermia on TSV infection. This work has resulted in 3 manuscripts, which constitute the core of this dissertation. The taxonomy throughout this dissertation is done according to Holthuis (1980). The first manuscript describes the production of a monoclonal antibody reacting with the Belize strain of TSV. The antibody, MAb 2 C 4, exhibits good sensitivity and specificity for TSV in immunohistochemistry (IHC) and dot blot immunoassay. MAb 2 C 4 reacted with the TSV-HI 94, TSV-SI 98 and TSV-BZ 02 variants, but not with the TSV-VE 05 and TSV-TH 05 variants. This antibody adds and improves tools to those available for TSV diagnosis. Chapter three describes a relatively novel variant of TSV from Venezuela, which was characterized by our laboratory. By genetic sequencing, this new isolate exhibits a 94 % similarity with TSV-HI 94. IHC, dot blot immunoassay and bioassays were also performed. While processed samples reacted only weakly with the TSV monoclonal antibody MAb 1 A 1, the virus in its native state reacted strongly with the antibody. In bioassays, TSV-VE 05 presented mortality comparable to TSV-HI 94 in Penaeus vannamei. These data confirm the presence of TSV in Venezuela and that a new variant of the virus was responsible for the outbreak of TS. In chapter four, the behavior of TSV infection under hyperthermic conditions was examined. I compared the susceptibility of Kona stock P. vannamei to the infection by two variants of TSV under hyperthermic conditions (32 oC). Shrimp, infected with TSV-HI 94, were resistant to infection at high temperature. However, under the same hyperthermic conditions, the challenged shrimp were fully susceptible to the infection by TSV-BZ 02. This susceptibility to TSV-BZ 02 at higher temperatures was independent both of the route of infection and of the salinity of water. I conjecture that TSV-BZ 02 might be a temperature permissible mutant of TSV...|$|E
40|$|White spot {{syndrome}} virus (WSSV), the {{etiologic agent}} of white spot disease, {{is currently the}} most important viral pathogen infecting penaeid shrimp worldwide. Since the initial report, white spot disease has caused losses of catastrophic proportion to shrimp aquaculture globally. Although considerable {{progress has been made}} in characterizing the WSSV and developing detection methods, information on the host genes involved in the immune response in shrimp due to WSSV infection is not available. During this research, the mRNA expression profiles in healthy and WSSV-infected shrimp were determined by analyzing the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and by microarray analysis. Our data show that WSSV infection alters the expression of a wide array of genes including those that are involved in immune function, signal transduction, structural genes, as well as mitochondrial genes among others. Using EST analysis and real-time RT-PCR, we also identified a candidate receptor gene for another viral pathogen of shrimp, the <b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> virus (TSV).

40|$|The <b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> virus (TSV), {{a member}} of the Dicistroviridae family of viruses, is a {{single-stranded}} positive-sense RNA virus which contains two nonoverlapping reading frames separated by a 230 -nucleotide intergenic region. This intergenic region contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) which directs the synthesis of the TSV capsid proteins. Unlike other dicistroviruses, the TSV IRES contains an AUG codon that is in frame with the capsid region, suggesting that the IRES initiates translation at this AUG codon by using initiator tRNAmet. We show here that the TSV IRES does not use this or any other AUG codon to initiate translation. Like the IRES in cricket paralysis virus (CrPV), the TSV IRES can assemble 80 S ribosomes in the absence of initiation factors and can direct protein synthesis in a reconstituted system that contains only purified ribosomal subunits, eukaryotic elongation factors 1 A and 2, and aminoacylated tRNAs. The functional conservation of the CrPV-like IRES elements in viruses that can infect different invertebrate hosts suggests that initiation at non-AUG codons by an initiation factor-independent mechanism may be more prevalent...|$|E
40|$|The prawn viruses White Spot Syndrome Virus {{and yellow}} head virus have been {{detected}} in frozen commodity prawns. However, no studies on the occurrence of two other Office International des Epizooties-listed viruses, <b>Taura</b> <b>Syndrome</b> virus (TSV) or infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV), have been published. Therefore, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) study on whether these two viruses {{could be found in}} frozen commodity prawns imported into Australia was undertaken. Amplicons indicative of TSV were found in 6 / 10 prawns collected at a retail outlet in Townsville and 10 / 10 prawns from Coff's Harbour using two different reverse transcriptase PCR protocols. Nucleotide sequences from the amplicons were between 97 % and 99 % similar to various TSV isolates from Asia. Amplicons indicative of the Philippine/American lineage of IHHNV were found in 5 / 5 and 5 / 6 prawns collected from Townsville and Coff's Harbour respectively. Clearly, frozen commodity Penaeus vannamei Boone from China can carry TSV and IHHNV with nucleic acid intact enough to be detected using PCR...|$|E
40|$|The giant {{freshwater}} prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii, is {{an economically}} important crustacean and is farmed in many countries. Since 2009, a larval mortality syndrome of M. rosenbergii has broken out and spread widely {{in the main}} breeding area, including Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Guangxi, and Guangdong Provinces in mainland China. A novel virus, named Macrobrachium rosenbergii Taihu virus (MrTV), was isolated from the moribund larvae and {{was determined to be}} the causative agent of the M. rosenbergii larval mortality syndrome by experimental infection. Further genomic sequencing suggested that the MrTV genome is monopartite, 10, 303 nt in length, and dicistronic with two non-overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) separated by an intergenic region (IGR) and flanked by untranslated regions (UTRs). Phylogenetic analysis using the full-length genomic sequence and the putative amino acid sequences of the capsid protein revealed that MrTV was more closely related to the <b>taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> virus (TSV) than to any other viruses. According to these molecular features, we proposed that MrTV is a new species in the genus Aparavirus, family Dicistroviridae. These results may shed light on controlling larval mortality syndrome in M. rosenbergii...|$|E
40|$|Chantier qualité GABioinformatics and {{re-sequencing}} approaches {{were used}} for the discovery of sequence polymorphisms in Litopenaeus vannamei. A total of 1221 putative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in a pool of individuals from various commercial populations. A set of 211 SNPs were selected for further molecular validation and 88 % showed variation in 637 samples representing three commercial breeding lines. An association analysis was performed between these markers and several traits of economic importance for shrimp producers including resistance to three major viral diseases. A small number of SNPs showed associations with test weekly gain, grow-out survival and resistance to <b>Taura</b> <b>Syndrome</b> Virus. Very low levels of linkage disequilibrium were revealed between most SNP pairs, with only 11 % of SNPs showing an r 2 -value above 0. 10 with at least one other SNP. Comparison of allele frequencies showed small changes over three generations of the breeding programme in one of the commercial breeding populations. This unique SNP resource has the potential to catalyse future studies of genetic dissection of complex traits, tracing relationships in breeding programmes, and monitoring genetic diversity in commercial and wild populations of L. vannamei...|$|E
40|$|Giant prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) and vaname shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) are {{types of}} shrimp that became {{excellent}} commodities in the fisheries sector. However, {{one of the}} obstacles in the vaname shrimp aquaculture is a disease caused by the infection of <b>Taura</b> <b>Syndrome</b> Virus (TSV). One of the consequence of raising the vaname shrimp in Indonesia {{is the possibility of}} spreading TSV infection in another shrimp species. TSV infection in giant prawns in Indonesia has not been reported. The aims of this study were: 1. To determine the resistance of giant prawns toward TSV infection and 2. To detect molecularly using RT-PCR technique the presence of viruses TSV on vaname shrimp or giant prawns infected with 3 different doses (0. 05 ml; 0. 10 ml and 0. 15 ml) of TSV inoculum using a pair of specific primers for TSV 9992 F (52 ̆ 7 -AAG CTT GCG TAG ACA GCC- 32 ̆ 7) and 9195 R (52 ̆ 7 -TCA AGA ATG GCT TCC TGG- 32 ̆ 7). The research results showed that vaname shrimp mortality infected by 0. 05 ml; 0. 10 ml and 0. 15 ml TSV inoculums were 14. 28...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} studies were {{conducted}} {{as part of my}} dissertation research on certain diseases of farmed penaeid shrimp and on strategies that might be applied to manage these diseases. These studies focused on the development and application of management for four shrimp diseases (TSV, YHV, WSSV and NHP) in the white shrimp Penaeus vannamei through different strategies. The studies focused on efforts to identify a new strain of <b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> virus (TSV), and the prevention or mitigation of infection by Yellow Head Disease (YHD), White Spot Disease (WSD), and Necrotizing Hepatopancreatitis (NHP). The new strain of TSV reported in this study is among the most pathogenic strains discovered to date. Disease management strategies investigated include the prevention of YHD in the Americas by pre-exposing Specific-Pathogen-Free (SPF) Penaeus vannamei to TSV. The other strategy investigated involved the use of a prototype "vaccine" that binds to the specific shrimp cell receptors and thus, prevents WSSV from establishing an infection. The last strategy attempted to elucidate the reasons for the very low prevalence of NHP in commercial shrimp ponds in Colombia. It was found that through establishment of a breeding program in which shrimp were selected for resistance to TSV infection, Colombian shrimp farmers also, but indirectly, selected for resistance to NHP...|$|E
40|$|Penaeid shrimp {{culture has}} become a leading export fishery in Indonesia. The Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) was unofficially intro- duced to Indonesia in 1999, and {{received}} government approval in 2001. By the end of 2007, the Pacific white shrimp was cultured in over 17 provinces. The main constraints of shrimp culture have always been diseases, espe- cially those caused by viral agents. <b>Taura</b> <b>syndrome</b> (TS) disease was detected in Indonesia in 2002 and the disease currently affects at least ten provinces. Infectious myonecrosis (IMN) is an emerging L. vannamei dis- ease, first detected in Indonesia in May-June 2006. IMN disease causes significant mortality in growout ponds and is characterized by acute onset of gross signs: focal to extensive whitish necrotic areas in the striated mus- cle, especially of the distal abdominal segments and the tail fan. The white necrotic areas redden, similar {{to the color of}} cooked shrimp. The outbreak results in elevated mortality that was initially associated with a chronic course of persistent low level mortality. To date, IMN has been detected in East Java, Bali, and West Nusa Tenggara provinces. This paper reviews studies of IMN disease of Pacific white shrimp in Indonesia: outbreaks, sur- veillance, diagnosis, and control measures...|$|E
