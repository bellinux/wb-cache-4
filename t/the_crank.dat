5|$|Modern {{archaeology}} {{has led to}} {{the discovery}} of Han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in Han literary sources. This includes <b>the</b> <b>crank</b> handle. Han pottery tomb models of farmyards and gristmills possess the first known depictions of crank handles, which were used to operate the fans of winnowing machines. The machine was used to separate chaff from grain, but the Chinese of later dynasties also employed <b>the</b> <b>crank</b> handle for silk-reeling, hemp-spinning, flour-sifting, and drawing water from a well using the windlass. To measure distance traveled, the Han-era Chinese also created the odometer cart. This invention is depicted in Han artwork by the 2nd century CE, yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the 3rd century CE. The wheels of this device rotated a set of gears which in turn forced mechanical figures to bang gongs and drums that alerted the travelers of the distance traveled (measured in li). From existing specimens found at archaeological sites, it is known that Han-era craftsmen made use of the sliding metal caliper to make minute measurements. Although Han-era calipers bear incised inscriptions of the exact day of the year they were manufactured, they are not mentioned in any Han literary sources.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} unusual {{features}} of the design: {{the first of which}} was the setting of <b>the</b> <b>crank</b> axles at 135°, rather than the standard 90° of other locomotive types. This design necessitated four sets of valve gear, and gave rise to eight beats per revolution, rather than the usual four, designed to give a more even draw on the fire and less chance of wheelslip when starting. The second difference was that fire grate was in two sections, the rear portion was horizontal and the front sloped away sharply.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's machine used a {{belt and}} pulley system that could be {{operated}} by one person turning a crank. A large pulley {{was attached to the}} crank-handle, and a much smaller pulley was attached to a large glass globe. An iron axle passed through the globe. This allowed the globe to be rotated at high speed. When <b>the</b> <b>crank</b> was turned, the glass globe rubbed against a leather pad, which generated a large static charge, similar to the electrical charge that could be created by rubbing a glass tube with wool cloth by hand. The machine was unique improvement over others made in Europe at the time, as the glass globe could be spun faster with much less labor. A few revolutions of the handle was all that was needed to charge a Leyden jar.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cranks</b> {{themselves}} {{also produce}} counterbalance {{due to their}} weight, so on pumpjacks that do not carry very heavy loads, the weight of <b>the</b> <b>cranks</b> themselves may be enough to balance the well load.|$|R
50|$|In typical modern bikes, {{the bottom}} bracket spindle is {{separate}} from <b>the</b> <b>cranks.</b> This {{is known as}} a three-piece crankset. <b>The</b> <b>cranks</b> attach to <b>the</b> spindle via a common square taper, a cotter or via a variety of splined interfaces.|$|R
40|$|An article (30) is {{controllably}} {{and precisely}} positioned {{at one of}} three discrete locations defined by a linkage. The positioning apparatus includes two independently driven cranks (34, 42), with a link (50) pivotably connected between <b>the</b> two <b>cranks</b> (34, 42). Another connector (44) is pivotably connected between one of <b>the</b> <b>cranks</b> (34 or 42) and the article (30) to be positioned. <b>The</b> <b>cranks</b> (34, 42) are rotationally adjusted so that the pivot points (52, 54) of the link (50) are collinear with the axes of rotation of <b>the</b> <b>cranks</b> (40, 48), thereby defining {{one of the three}} discrete locations. Additional cranks and links can be provided to define additional discrete locations...|$|R
5|$|During the Williamite Wars of 1690–1691, the {{garrison}} espoused {{the cause of}} James II in contrast with that of Birr, which took the side of William. A stone bridge across the Shannon was erected in 1685, and a Williamite army advancing from Birr in 1690 attempted to break it down but abandoned the attempt as too risky in consequence {{of the presence of}} Sarsfield's Army on the Connacht side. A broken arch of this bridge is still to be seen on that side a few yards below the present bridge of seven arches, which was erected by the Commissioners for the Improvement of Navigation of the Shannon in 1841–1843. The square tower on the lower side of the bridge at the Galway end was erected to protect the old bridge, as was the Salt Battery, with emplacements for four cannons facing west and north, a few hundred yards from town along <b>the</b> <b>Crank</b> Road.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{archaeology}} {{has led to}} {{the discovery}} of Han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in Han literary sources. As observed in Han miniature tomb models, but not in literary sources, <b>the</b> <b>crank</b> handle was used to operate the fans of winnowing machines that separated grain from chaff. The odometer cart, invented during Han, measured journey lengths, using mechanical figures banging drums and gongs to indicate each distance traveled. This invention is depicted in Han artwork by the 2nd century AD, yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the 3rd century AD. Modern archaeologists have also unearthed specimens of devices used during the Han dynasty, for example a pair of sliding metal calipers used by craftsmen for making minute measurements. These calipers contain inscriptions of the exact day and year they were manufactured. These tools are not mentioned in any Han literary sources.|$|E
5|$|To {{indicate}} {{the direction of}} a distant earthquake, Zhang's device dropped a bronze ball from one of eight tubed projections shaped as dragon heads; the ball fell into the mouth of a corresponding metal object shaped as a toad, each representing a direction like the points on a compass rose. His device had eight mobile arms (for all eight directions) connected with cranks having catch mechanisms at the periphery. When tripped, a crank and right angle lever would raise a dragon head and release a ball which had been supported by the lower jaw of the dragon head. His device also included a vertical pin passing through a slot in <b>the</b> <b>crank,</b> a catch device, a pivot on a projection, a sling suspending the pendulum, an attachment for the sling, and a horizontal bar supporting the pendulum. Wang Zhenduo (王振鐸) argued that the technology of the Eastern Han era was sophisticated enough to produce such a device, as evidenced by contemporary levers and cranks used in other devices such as crossbow triggers.|$|E
50|$|Cranks Creek is {{also home}} to <b>the</b> <b>Cranks</b> Creek Wildlife Management Area and the Stone Mountain Wildlife Management Area. Stone Mountain {{includes}} the unique wagon road, a hand-built road and tunnel that allowed those living on <b>the</b> <b>Cranks</b> Creek side of Stone Mountain to access the railroad line on the Virginia side.|$|R
5000|$|Let θi, i=1, ..., 5 be {{the angular}} {{positions}} of <b>the</b> input <b>crank,</b> and let ψi, i=1, ..., 5 be the corresponding angles of <b>the</b> output <b>crank.</b> For convenience locate the fixed pivot of <b>the</b> input <b>crank</b> at <b>the</b> {{origin of the}} fixed frame, O=(0, 0), and let the fixed pivot of <b>the</b> output <b>crank</b> be located at C=(cx, cy), which is chosen by the designer. The unknowns in this synthesis problem are the coordinates g=(gx, gy) of the coupler attachment to <b>the</b> input <b>crank</b> and <b>the</b> coordinates w=(wx, wy) of the attachment to <b>the</b> output <b>crank,</b> measured in their respective reference frames.|$|R
50|$|In 1995, Yamaha fitted 270° {{crankshaft}} to its TRX850 and in 1996 to the TDM850 MK2, plus {{a balance}} shaft {{to counter the}} resulting combination of free forces and rocking couples. <b>The</b> 270° <b>crank</b> has smaller free forces than <b>the</b> 360° <b>crank</b> (but much larger than <b>the</b> 180° <b>crank)</b> and smaller rocking couples than <b>the</b> 180° <b>crank</b> (<b>the</b> 360° <b>crank</b> has no such couple). Whilst firing was as uneven as a 90° V-Twin, <b>the</b> 270° <b>crank</b> was not as uneven as the 180°. The 270° configuration represents a successful compromise and has been adopted for Honda's NC700 and 2016 Africa Twin, Hinckley Triumph's Scrambler and Thunderbird cruiser, Yamaha's MT-07 / FZ-07 {{and a number of}} others.|$|R
5|$|The {{land where}} the Glidden House stands once held a log structure, which Glidden lived {{in when he}} first came to DeKalb at the beckoning of his cousin Russell Huntley. The house was built in 1861 for barbed wire {{entrepreneur}} Joseph Farwell Glidden. As his personal residence, the house, and its accompanying barn, were closely associated with his invention, really just an improvement, of barbed wire. Glidden's improvement upon a wire board fence developed by Henry Rose was of vast importance in the settlement of the United States west of the Mississippi. It was after Glidden saw Rose exhibit his wire at a fair in 1873 that he was struck with the idea of attaching barbs to wire strand fencing. Glidden is said to have experimented with some of his ideas in the basement kitchen of the Glidden House. He noticed that whenever he tried to attach s directly to strands of wire they slid {{along the length of the}} wire; Glidden realized he needed a way to crimp the barbs. He began tinkering around the home's kitchen. Glidden fit two hair pins to the shaft of a coffee mill, one centered and the other off-center. He found that by placing the wire between the pins and turning <b>the</b> <b>crank</b> a uniform barb resulted. How to crimp the barbs to the wire was solved, in the barn, by tying one end of the wire and another length of wire to a poplar tree on the grounds of the Glidden House and the other ends of the wires to a grindstone. The grindstone was used to twist the wires together and prevent the barbs from slipping.|$|E
25|$|While Babbage's {{original}} design placed <b>the</b> <b>crank</b> {{directly on the}} main shaft, it was later realized that the force required to crank the machine {{would have been too}} great for a human to handle comfortably. Therefore, the two models that were built incorporate a 4:1 reduction gear at <b>the</b> <b>crank,</b> and four revolutions of <b>the</b> <b>crank</b> are required to perform one full cycle.|$|E
