5|$|Chaplin's {{loneliness}} {{was relieved}} when he met 21-year-old actress Paulette Goddard in July 1932, and the pair began a successful relationship. He was not ready <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> a film, however, and focused on writing a serial about his travels (published in Woman's Home Companion).

It was these concerns that stimulated Chaplin to develop his new film.|$|E
