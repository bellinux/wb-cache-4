5|$|The game runs on an {{upgraded}} version of Valve's proprietary Source engine, and features both the engine's advanced lighting effects, {{and a new}} version of its facial animation/expression technology. Upgrades to enemy AI allow Combine soldiers to utilize tactics previously unavailable to them. For example, Combine soldiers were given the ability to crouch while being fired upon in order <b>to</b> <b>duck</b> underneath the player's line of fire. The game's soundtrack was composed by Kelly Bailey. The music is used sparingly throughout; it plays primarily during scenes of major plot developments or particularly important action sequences such as large battles or when encountering a new enemy.|$|E
5|$|At 21:00UTC on July2, a {{hurricane}} warning was posted in North Carolina from Surf City <b>to</b> <b>Duck,</b> including Albemarle and Pamlico sounds. Additionally, {{a tropical storm}} warning was issued from the Santee River to Surf City, while another one became in effect from Duck to Cape Charles Light in Virginia, including the mouth of Chesapeake Bay. A tropical storm warning was posted in Massachusetts at 21:00UTC on July3, stretching from Provincetown to Chatham along Cape Cod including Nantucket, {{in addition to a}} tropical storm watch between Port Maitland and Point Aconi issued by Environment Canada. Around 01:00UTC on July4, the hurricane watch was discontinued south of Surf City, while the tropical storm warning was discontinued south of Little River Inlet. Two hours later, the tropical storm warning was canceled south of Cape Fear, North Carolina, and tropical storm watches in Canada were expanded to encompass New Brunswick from the Canada–United States border to Grande Anse, Nova Scotia including Cape Breton Island, and Prince Edward Island.|$|E

5|$|Camping is {{available}} at local recreational vehicle parks (RV parks), including Carl Precht Memorial RV Park, Sunset Lakes RV Park (adjacent <b>to</b> <b>Duck</b> Lake), and Margie's R.V. Park. There are over a half-dozen campgrounds in proximity to Omak. The Omak–Okanogan region has been well known for its rock climbing structures since the early 1970s. Nearby communities in Okanogan County offer horseback riding and hunting. Fishing and boating is achievable within short distance, at the nearby Omak Lake. The Omak Pioneers represent Omak High School as their baseball, basketball, football, soccer, volleyball, and wrestling teams. There are separate teams based on age and gender. There are all-terrain vehicle (ATV) courses located nearby, specifically in the Loup Loup Ski Bowl.|$|E
5|$|M-204 {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with M-22 (Manitou Trail) south of Leland next <b>to</b> <b>Duck</b> Lake. From there it follows Duck Lake Road {{along the south}} shore of Lake Leelanau's northern lobe. The two-lane roadway runs eastward and then southeasterly through a mixture of woods and fields {{to the village of}} Lake Leelanau. One there, M-204 follows Phillip Street across the Narrows and turns northeasterly. The bridge that the trunkline uses is eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Outside of town, the highway follows Duck Lake Road again past the county seat of Leelanau County. Near the intersection with Horn Road, M-204 turns southeasterly toward the village of Suttons Bay. As the trunkline descends a hill into the village, it passes through vineyards and woods. Inside town, M-204 follows Race Street and ends downtown at M-22 (St. Joseph Avenue).|$|E
5|$|The {{final day}} started poorly for England, with Compton edging Johnston to a diving Miller at second slip {{from the second}} ball of the day. England had lost a wicket without adding to their {{overnight}} total. Yardley and Dollery took the score to 133 before Toshack bowled the former. He then trapped Coxon lbw two balls later in the same over. Eight runs later, Dollery shaped <b>to</b> <b>duck</b> a Lindwall bouncer, but it skidded through low and bowled him. Lindwall bowled Laker for a duck later in the same over to leave England at 141/8. Evans continued to resist stubbornly, remaining 24 not out as England were bowled out for 186 to cede a 409-run victory. Toshack ended the innings with 5/40, while Lindwall and Johnston took three and two respectively. The gross attendance was 132,000 and receipts were £43,000 — a record for a Test in England.|$|E

5|$|Yardley and Dollery {{took the}} score to 133 before Toshack bowled the former for 11. He trapped {{the new man}} Coxon two balls later in the same over for a duck, leaving England at 133/6. Coxon shuffled across his stumps and missed his first delivery, which hit {{him in front of}} the stumps and {{prompted}} a loud lbw appeal, and did the same thing to the next ball. During this spell, Toshack conceded only seven runs from eight overs, but was taken off as Bradman wanted to take the new ball and utilise Lindwall and Johnston. In the meantime, Dollery had continued to bat effectively, watching the ball closely onto his bat, and scoring three leg side boundaries from Johnston's bowling. Eight runs after Coxon's dismissal, Dollery shaped <b>to</b> <b>duck</b> a Lindwall bouncer, but it skidded through low and bowled him. Lindwall bowled Laker without scoring later in the same over to leave England at 141/8. Evans continued to resist stubbornly, remaining 24 not out as England were bowled out for 186 to cede a 409-run victory. Johnston had Bedser caught by Hassett for nine before Wright hit Toshack to Lindwall for four.|$|E
5|$|In most bouts, the retiarius {{probably}} had {{to resort to}} fighting with just his trident and dagger, placing him at a disadvantage. The trident was his primary weapon in such situations, and its length allowed the retiarius to keep his opponent at bay. He held the weapon two-handed, left nearer the prongs, so that he could parry his enemy's strikes with its shaft and strike with both ends. Wielded two-handed, the weapon could land powerful blows. Images show retiarii stabbing downward at the secutors unshielded legs or stabbing down at the helmet in an attempt to poke through an eyehole. The trident itself was too weak to pierce the metal, although a skull found at Ephesus, Turkey, dating to CE200 to 300 shows that a trident strike to the head could be fatal on a bareheaded opponent. The secutors helmet was rounded and free of protrusions to avoid snaring the net or being caught in the trident's prongs, but attacks on it forced the secutor <b>to</b> <b>duck</b> or hide behind his shield. This reduced his field of vision and gave the retiarius an advantage with his speed. Should the secutor strike with his sword, the retiarius parried with the trident prongs and attempted to disarm him. Likewise, the more heavily armoured gladiator tried to block the trident with his shield and force the net-man to lose it. Another type of gladiator, scissor could also be pitted against a retiarius. Images from the Eastern Roman Empire show scissores wearing a tubular arm-guard in lieu of a shield. The guard fits over the left hand and ends in a hooked, knife-like blade that was probably intended to parry the net and trident or to snag and pull away the net. Scissores who succeeded in this probably dropped the hook weapon and fought with just a sword.|$|E

25|$|The usual {{response}} to a bouncer is for the batsman simply <b>to</b> <b>duck</b> underneath it, but this requires fast reflexes and a strong nerve and the batsman is sometimes hit in any case. The natural reflex is to attempt to defend one's head with a straight bat but this should be suppressed if possible as the likely result {{of this will be}} that the ball flies off the bat at an uncontrolled angle making for an easy catch. Most batsman have panicked and lost their wickets in this fashion several times in their career after prolonged spells of bouncers.|$|E

Chaisson ignored the rebel officer and ordered his men to deploy to the Struggle Movement positions anyway. The Americans simply sat down on the road among the rebels without using any force. Walt then arrived and he and Chaisson walked across the bridge. They never reached the other side, as a rebel warrant officer ordered them to halt, threatening to explode the bridge.
