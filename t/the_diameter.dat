All patients include in this study were high myopes with axial length greater than 26. 5 mm. All eyes were planned for clear lens extraction or cataract extraction. Results: In group (A), a statistically significant negative correlation was found between <b>the</b> <b>diameters</b> of <b>the</b> capsular bags and <b>the</b> <b>diameters</b> of <b>the</b> implanted on – piece IOLs.

40|$|Background: <b>The</b> <b>diameters</b> of <b>the</b> {{coronary}} arteries {{have been suggested}} to be a potential predictor of coronary artery disease (CAD). However, whether <b>the</b> <b>diameters</b> of <b>the</b> {{coronary arteries}} {{are associated with the}} coronary lesion severity on angiography has not been determined. Methods: One hundred sixty-seven consecutive adult patients (109 men and 58 women) aged 31 – 84 years who underwent coronary angiography for suspected or known CAD were enrolled. The known catheter tip diameter was used as the calibration to measure <b>the</b> <b>diameters</b> of coronary arteries, and the severity of coronary lesions was evaluated with the vessel score and Gensini score. Results: In patients with a higher vessel score and Gensini score, <b>the</b> <b>diameters</b> of <b>the</b> left main (LM), left anterior descending (LAD), left circumflex (LCX), and right coronary arteries (RCA) were smaller (all p&#x 3 c; 0. 05) than those in patients with lower scores.

Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>diameters</b> of <b>the</b> coronary arteries were potential predictors of CAD, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0. 268 for average diameter (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 183 – 0. 353, p&#x 3 c; 0. 00001), 0. 356 for <b>the</b> LM <b>diameter</b> (95 % CI: 0. 266 – 0. 445, p= 0. 005), 0. 214 for <b>the</b> LAD <b>diameter</b> (95 % CI: 0. 136 – 0. 291, p&#x 3 c; 0. 00001), 0. 366 for <b>the</b> LCX <b>diameter</b> (95 % CI: 0. 271 – 0. 461, p= 0. 009), and 0. 346 for <b>the</b> RCA <b>diameter</b> (95 % CI: 0. 245 – 0. 447, p= 0. 003).

5|$|The account {{published}} in Journal des sçavans {{was based on}} a report that Rømer read to the French Academy of Sciences in November 1676 (Cohen, 1940, p.346). When measured from Earth, the periods of moons orbiting a distant planet are shorter when the Earth is approaching the planet than when the Earth is receding from it. The distance travelled by light from the planet (or its moon) to Earth is shorter when the Earth is at the point in its orbit that is closest to its planet than when the Earth is at the farthest point in its orbit, the difference in distance being <b>the</b> <b>diameter</b> of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The observed change in the moon's orbital period is caused by the difference {{in the time it takes}} light to traverse the shorter or longer distance.

Christiaan Huygens combined this estimate with an estimate for <b>the</b> <b>diameter</b> of the Earth's orbit to obtain an estimate of speed of light of , 26% lower than the actual value.|$|E

5|$|The size of {{the welding}} torch nozzle depends {{on the amount of}} {{shielded}} area desired.

The inside diameter of the nozzle is preferably at least three times <b>the</b> <b>diameter</b> of the electrode, but there are no hard rules. The welder judges the effectiveness of the shielding and increases the nozzle size to increase the area protected by the external gas shield as needed. The nozzle must be heat resistant and thus is normally made of alumina or a ceramic material, but fused quartz, a high purity glass, offers greater visibility. Devices can be inserted into the nozzle for special applications, such as gas lenses or valves to improve the control shielding gas flow to reduce turbulence and introduction of contaminated atmosphere into the shielded area. Hand switches to control welding current can be added to the manual GTAW torches.|$|E
