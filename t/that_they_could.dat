5|$|Irreducible {{complexity}} is {{the idea}} that certain biological systems cannot be broken down into their constituent parts and remain functional, and therefore <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not have evolved naturally from less complex or complete systems. Whereas past arguments of this nature generally relied on macroscopic organs, Behe's primary examples of irreducible complexity have been cellular and biochemical in nature. He has argued that the components of systems such as the blood clotting cascade, the immune system, and the bacterial flagellum are so complex and interdependent <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not have evolved from simpler systems.|$|E
5|$|Also, in 1900 Amico Bignami and Giuseppe Bastianelli found <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not infect an {{individual}} with blood containing only gametocytes. The possibility {{of the existence of}} a chronic blood stage infection was proposed by Ronald Ross and David Thompson in 1910.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Graham, {{programmer}} of {{the original}} game, had returned to university after its completion, and David Darling, co-founder of Codemasters, decided <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not {{wait for him to}} finish his degree. Codemasters approached Peter Williamson of Supersonic Software and had him produce the sequel. Williamson had just completed Cosmic Spacehead and wanted to do something new. It was intended for the sequel to reproduce the feeling {{of the original}} and add as many new features as possible. The original was used for reference, and the code and graphics were produced from the beginning. Williamson explained that it was hoped <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> capture and go beyond that the original game offered, and the game's success was anticipated. Darling wanted it {{to be more than a}} mere continuation of the first.|$|E
60|$|They hastily {{turned their}} eyes away, for at <b>that</b> moment <b>they</b> <b>could</b> {{not bear to}} see each other.|$|R

5000|$|Leaders were {{convinced}} <b>that</b> if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> navigate NovaStar through <b>that</b> storm, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> take their lessons learned and help other entrepreneurs grow and scale their businesses; defer taxes {{and do it}} all over again. With the self-induced collapse in 2008, they began reinventing NovaStar based on their core competencies: the ability to scale businesses and improve execution of an original concept. Since then they have acquired four companies - StreetLinks, Advent Financial Services, IVR Central (renamed CorvisaCloud) and Mango Moving.|$|R
5|$|Aristotle {{believed}} that comets were atmospheric phenomena, {{due to the}} fact <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> appear outside of the Zodiac and vary in brightness {{over the course of a}} few days. Pliny the Elder {{believed that}} comets were connected with political unrest and death.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{population}} size would not dramatically increase until the Song dynasty period, when the population doubled to 100 million {{people because of}} extensive rice cultivation in central and southern China, coupled with rural farmers holding more abundant yields of food <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> easily provide to the growing market.|$|E
5|$|Former North Melbourne and Hawthorn player, Andrew Demetriou, was {{appointed}} {{as the new}} CEO. The new administration set about examining the views and wishes of players so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> negotiate a new CBA (1998–2003) with the AFL.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{wish there}} were a {{mountain}} of fire {{between us and the}} Persians, so <b>that</b> neither <b>they</b> <b>could</b> get to us, nor we to them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The two men {{seemed much}} pleased. It was evident to them <b>that,</b> if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> do these things, it would widely {{add to their}} reputation.|$|R
50|$|The Donut Shop - A {{successful}} {{internet radio}} show talk about educational games <b>that</b> <b>they</b> think <b>could</b> {{be used in}} today's schools.|$|R
5|$|In May 1943, the Raymonds vouched for George Nakashima and his family, {{releasing}} {{them from}} a Japanese internment camp in Idaho, so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> come and live at the New Hope farm.|$|E
5|$|McGrady {{was still}} {{recovering}} from surgery to begin the 2009–10 campaign. On December 15, he returned to action but was limited to only seven minutes off the bench. After six games, the Rockets decided to shut him down again so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> focus on trading him to another team.|$|E
5|$|News {{of the two}} strikes, {{with the}} mistaken reports that each had sunk an American carrier, greatly {{improved}} Japanese morale. The few surviving aircraft were all recovered aboard Hiryū. Despite the heavy losses, the Japanese believed <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> scrape together enough aircraft for one more strike against what they {{believed to be the}} only remaining American carrier.|$|E
25|$|Union {{recognition}} {{became the}} biggest issue in the strike. The workers felt <b>that</b> if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> win recognition of the union, their other demands would come easily.|$|R
5000|$|The {{programmes}} {{were offered}} by the service [...] "on-demand". <b>That</b> is, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be selected by a user, and viewed at a time chosen by the user.|$|R
2500|$|Several Mormon apologists have {{proposed}} a variety of locations on the Arabian Peninsula <b>that</b> <b>they</b> believe <b>could</b> be the Book of Mormon location [...] "Shazer".|$|R
5|$|Since lahars were {{produced}} repeatedly, scientists realized <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> use these to analyze a trial period for a newly developed device proposed {{to measure the}} movement of rocks against each other. This device, now known as an Acoustic Flow Monitor, alerts nearby stations to possible lahars.|$|E
5|$|The O class' design {{reflected}} {{their intended}} role; a heavy main armament (six 380mm guns in three dual turrets) for possible encounters with escorting -armed heavy cruisers, enough armor {{to defend against}} the same and nothing more, and a high top speed so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> get away from slower but much better armored capital ships.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{also had}} {{significant}} political repercussions, shaking the British Army's confidence. The {{fact that the}} siege had taken so long exposed the British forces' vulnerabilities and encouraged the native Indian states– in particular the old Maratha Confederacy in central India– to continue their resistance against British imperialism in the hope <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> still be defeated.|$|E
60|$|So great indeed {{was their}} faith in a mother's love <b>that</b> <b>they</b> felt <b>they</b> <b>could</b> afford to be callous for a bit longer.|$|R
5000|$|The UFL {{planned for}} each team to {{eventually}} sell shares {{to the public}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> hoped <b>could</b> raise another $60 million. [...] This never came to pass.|$|R
60|$|Their retreat was so chosen <b>that</b> while <b>they</b> <b>could</b> {{watch the}} river, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> watch the house. No one had passed in or out, since the {{daughter}} {{thought she heard}} the father calling. No one could pass in or out without being seen.|$|R
5|$|The college {{enrolled}} {{its first}} African American students in 1963, following a federal lawsuit brought by Dana Smith, who {{became one of}} the first five African Americans at the institution when a district court judge ruled <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not be denied admission based on race.|$|E
5|$|The {{control of}} Vijithapura was {{essential}} to both sides. The loss of the stronghold would be a largely demoralizing factor for Elara's forces and would significantly reduce their capability to resist Duthhagamani's advance. For Dutthagamani's forces, the capture of the city would mean <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> easily move on to Anuradhapura.|$|E
5|$|The {{first game}} of the {{campaign}} was against Lithuanian team FK Sūduva. Sūduva stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not send a scout to Glasgow to spy on Celtic to prepare for their match, and instead had to watch videotapes of their opponents.|$|E
60|$|And <b>that</b> was all <b>they</b> <b>could</b> {{think to}} say. Presently Scott {{opened his eyes}} again.|$|R
5000|$|The writers {{would prefer}} to put a chicken hat on J.J. and have him prance around saying [...] and <b>that</b> way <b>they</b> <b>could</b> waste {{a few minutes and}} not have to write {{meaningful}} dialogue.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{threw the}} stick away behind the {{railings}} in the park. I had forgotten that the stick was Luke's: I {{knew that it}} was not mine, and <b>that</b> therefore <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not trace it to me.|$|R
5|$|The {{frame and}} {{qualification}} problems. AI researchers (like John McCarthy) who used logic discovered <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not represent ordinary deductions that involved planning or default reasoning without making {{changes to the}} structure of logic itself. They developed new logics (like non-monotonic logics and modal logics) to try to solve the problems.|$|E
5|$|The great {{advantage}} Campbell's filters {{had over the}} RL circuit and other simple filters of the time was <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be designed for any desired degree of stop band rejection or steepness of transition between pass band and stop band. It was only necessary to add more filter sections until the desired response was obtained.|$|E
5|$|The {{losses at}} Fort Lee and Washington placed a heavy {{toll on the}} Patriots. When they {{evacuated}} their forts, {{they were forced to}} leave behind critical supplies and munitions. Many troops had been killed or taken prisoner, and the morale of the remaining troops was low. Few believed <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> win the war and gain independence.|$|E
50|$|Norfolk Accident rescue Service (NARS) {{was formed}} in 1970, when {{ambulances}} were very basic and their drivers had limited first aid training. Some local doctors recognised <b>that</b> if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be summoned {{to the scene of}} serious road traffic accidents, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> help to prevent people dying needlessly.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you go to}} Frankfort, {{you can see the}} King of Italy too," [...] {{said the}} Bavarian, but he owned <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{probably}} <b>could</b> not get into a hotel there, and he asked why they should not go to Wurzburg, where <b>they</b> <b>could</b> see all the sovereigns except the King of Italy.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{subject of}} the revised song is the self-centeredness of people and how the singer hesitates to tell them... the way <b>that</b> <b>they</b> live <b>could</b> be better." [...] "How can I come on when I know Im guilty" [...] was excised in favor of [...] "how can I come onand tell them the way <b>that</b> <b>they</b> live <b>could</b> be better". Most of the other lyrics stayed the same, {{and in spite of}} the changes, the {{psychedelic}} lyrics [...] "they trip through their day and waste all their thoughts at night" [...] were kept in the song.|$|R
