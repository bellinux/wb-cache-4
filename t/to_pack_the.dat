5|$|By the 2005–06 season, {{clubs in}} England were {{increasingly}} {{in favour of}} using the 4–5–1 system. Wenger, having earlier suggested he would never resort to a negative system, later adopted the formation for Champions League matches. The decision <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>the</b> midfield and play a lone striker resulted in Arsenal reaching the final. With Fábregas breaking into the first team, Wenger chose to deviate from their counter-attacking style, to a more possession based one. In 2009–10, he instituted a fluid 4–3–3 formation to benefit from Fàbregas' creativity, and since the player's departure, had remodelled the system to 4–1–4–1 and 4–2–3–1. During {{the latter half of}} the 2016–17 Premier League season, Wenger switched to a 3-4-3 formation first used against Middlesbrough in a 1-2 win.|$|E

25|$|It {{follows that}} the most {{effective}} field placements for aggressive fast bowling are <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>the</b> outfield and the slips cordon and gully since these are the positions in which the batsman {{is most likely to}} be caught. Placing fielders in the outfield has the additional benefit of limiting the number of places where a batsman can score a boundary. Other close fielding positions such as silly mid on/off and the various midwicket and cover positions are generally redundant.|$|E
25|$|While many {{algorithms}} {{reach an}} exact solution, approximation algorithms seek an approximation that {{is closer to}} the true solution. Approximation can be reached by either using a deterministic or a random strategy. Such algorithms have practical value for many hard problems. One of the examples of an approximate algorithm is the Knapsack problem. The Knapsack problem is a problem where there is a set of given items. The goal of the problem is <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>the</b> knapsack to get the maximum total value. Each item has some weight and some value. Total weight that we can carry is no more than some fixed number X. So, we must consider weights of items as well as their value.|$|E
25|$|Scrubbing tubes: Water {{before and}} after the animal chamber must be removed. One {{arrangement}} would use a large acrylic column of Drierite (8 mesh (scale), i.e., relatively coarse) upstream (before the push pump, before the animal chamber) to dry incurrent airstream and several tubes with smaller mesh (10-20, i.e., relatively fine) Drierite to remove water after the animal chamber. To prepare a scrubbing tube, make sure there is a small amount of cotton {{at either end of the}} tube to prevent dust particles from traveling to the analyzers. Use small amounts of cotton, say around 0.005 g, just enough to keep the dust out of the tubing. Large amounts of cotton will block air flow when/if it gets damp. Pour the Drierite into the tube with a funnel, tap the tube on the bench <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>the</b> grains tightly (to increase surface area - air + water rushes through loose Drierite, requiring frequent changes of scrubbers), and cap off with a small amount of cotton. To remove carbon dioxide] {{before and after}} the animal chamber, Ascarite II is used (Ascarite II is a registered trademark of the Arthur H. Thomas Co.). Ascarite II contains NaOH, which is caustic (so don't get any on your skin and keep away from water). A scrubbing tube is prepared by placing a small amount of cotton into the tube end, filling one-third of the way with 10-20 mesh Drierite, adding a small amount of cotton, then an additional third of the tube with the Ascarite II, another layer of cotton, followed by more Drierite and capping the tube off with another small amount of cotton. Tap the tube on the bench as each layer is added <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>the</b> grains. Note: Driereite can be used over and over again (after heating in an oven), although indicating Drierite will lose color with repeated drying; Ascarite II is used once and will be considered a hazardous waste.|$|E

25|$|On August 13, 2005, the Gush Katif {{region was}} closed to non-residents, {{in keeping with the}} plan to {{evacuate}} the Katif bloc. Though effectively violating the Disengagement law, which most residents viewed as highly immoral and illegitimate, most settlers did not voluntarily leave their homes or even pack in preparation for the eviction. On August 15, 2005, the forcible evacuation of the Gush Katif settlements began. On August 22, 2005, the residents of the last settlement, Netzarim, were evicted. In essence, many residents returned <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>the</b> contents of their homes and the Israeli government began the destruction of all residential buildings. On September 12, 2005, the Israeli Army withdrew from each settlement up to the Green Line. All public buildings (schools, libraries, community centres, office buildings) as well as industrial buildings, factories, and greenhouses which could not be taken apart were left intact.|$|E
25|$|There {{were other}} mills besides the textile mills. Between Field Mill and Town Mill, {{there was an}} iron foundry, called Meadow Foundry, which was built by William Bradshaw and John Sansom in 1852. The site had {{previously}} been occupied by a water-powered bark mill, and remained in the ownership of the Duke of Portland. In 1867, Bradshaw and Sansom negotiated a new 14-year lease with the Duke, which included the supply of water from King's Mill reservoir, but they became bankrupt during the following year. It {{was taken over by}} James Bownes, who formed a limited company to operate it, and it remained in use until 1960, when the firm moved to new premises, and the site was redeveloped by the Mansfield Brewery. Below the foundry was Borough Mills, which operated as a saw mill. Between Town Mills and Stanton Mill was the Rock Valley Mill, which was operated by Dickenson Ellis as a mustard mill in the early nineteenth century. It was taken over by David Cooper Barringer in 1839, who formed Barringer and Company to operate it. In 1873, they decided <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>the</b> mustard in decorated tin boxes, instead of wooden ones, and made the boxes on site from pre-printed metal sheet. Soon they were making tin boxes for other companies, and the separate Rock Valley Tin Works was formed in 1889. Three years later, a printing works was established, to print the metal sheets, and it became a limited company in 1895. Following several takeovers, it remains in business as Carnaud Metal Box Engineering.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the next}} seven years he {{continued}} his research and lecture tours assisted and encouraged by his wife and children. All this came to an end on July 16, 1917, however, when Lomax was fired along with six other faculty members {{as the result of a}} political battle between Governor James E. Ferguson and the University President, Dr. R. E. Vinson. Lomax moved to Chicago to take a job selling bonds at Lee, Higginson & Co; a bond brokerage firm run by the son of his old professor Barrett Wendell. A few months later, Ferguson was impeached and the Board of Regents rescinded its dismissal of the faculty. Lomax judged that it would be wrong to leave his post at Lee, Higginson & Co so soon after arriving, especially with regards to his friendship with the family of Barrett Wendell, so he remained in Chicago for eighteen months until the war ended. There he struck up a what turned out to be a lifelong friendship with Chicago poet Carl Sandburg, who frequently mentions him in his book, American Songbag (1927). In 1919, his next book, Songs of the Cattle Trail and Cow Camp, an anthology of cowboy poetry, was published by Macmillan. That year Lomax returned to Texas to be secretary of the Texas Exes, which had become financially independent of the University, so as to avoid further interference from politicians. Nevertheless, interference struck, when Ferguson, whom the law prohibited from holding office, ran his wife, Miriam A. Ferguson, as his surrogate. As governor, Mrs. Ferguson was able <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>the</b> board of regents and oust John from his job as editor of The Alcade, which during his tenure was a 100-page long publication. Seeing how the wind was blowing, Lomax resigned his secretaryship and joined the Republic Bank of Dallas in 1925. The economic crash of 1929 presaged bad things for the bank, however.|$|E

500|$|The issue {{concerned}} Hand {{again during}} the New Deal period, when the Supreme Court repeatedly overturned or blocked Franklin D. Roosevelt's legislation. As an instinctive democrat, Hand was appalled that an elected government should have its laws struck down in this way. He viewed it as a judicial [...] "usurpation" [...] for the Supreme Court to {{assume the role of}} a third chamber in these cases. As far as he was concerned, the Constitution already provided a full set of checks and balances on legislation. Nevertheless, Hand did not hesitate to condemn Roosevelt's frustrated attempt <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court in 1937, which led commentators to warn of totalitarianism. The answer, for Hand, lay in the separation of powers: courts should be independent and act on the legislation of elected governments.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Detective Vision" [...] {{crime scenes}} were {{designed}} to be brief, visually rewarding and fun segments, rather than demanding challenges. The designers worked {{on the length of}} time for each scene, seeing how many pieces of evidence players wanted to scan before they had a solution; they eventually settled on two to three minutes. A number of predator areas (levels where Batman stalks enemies from the shadows) provide variety and challenge. For example, the theatre aboard Penguin's ship was gradually shrunk in size <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>the</b> enemies closer together, and a hovering drone was removed when test players easily overcame it. A dynamic weather system altering gameplay (such as wind and snow reducing visibility, making snipers more vulnerable to Batman's stealth) was implemented during development, but discarded when it was not completed within the available development time.|$|E

500|$|Uncuts and The Guardians reviews {{were less}} enthusiastic.

The Guardian stated that [...] "if Franz's songwriting is broader than it was, it is still no deeper" [...] and that [...] "they'll keep trying to move your hips because they know they'll never win your heart." [...] This was echoed by the review in the Daily Mail, which {{described}} the album as [...] "a sterile, unwelcoming affair that fails <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>the</b> band's usual punch." [...] Paste was similarly severe, stating that the vocals are [...] "leering", the production [...] "horrific", and that the lyrics [...] "seem to lack both heart and brain" [...] and conclude by writing that [...] "the layoff suggests that Franz is either too confused or too lazy to move forward".|$|E

Holly Ellingwood of Active Anime commented that Black Cat [...] "knows how <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>the</b> action and the excitement to good effect, visuals and nail-biting suspense." [...] Sheena McNeil stressed that despite its flaws the series' action [...] "makes it all worth reading." [...] Ken Haley of Pop Culture Shock said that [...] "writing and characterization-wise" [...] it is a typical shōnen manga. Santos, Hoffman and McNeil criticized its plot for being [...] "predictable", clichéd, and [...] "not terribly original" [...] respectively. Leroy Douresseaux of Comic Book Bin called it [...] "an easy going version of Bleach", while Hoffman found it reminiscent of Cowboy Bebop, and McNeil compared it to Dragon Ball Z.|$|E
500|$|... 0n 19 August 1940, Johnson flew a Spitfire for {{the first}} time. Over the next weeks he practised handling, {{formation}} flying, attacks, battle climbs, aerobatics and dogfighting. During his training flights, he stalled and crashed a Spitfire. Johnson had his harness straps on too loose, and wrenched his shoulders – revealing that his earlier rugby injury had not healed properly. The Spitfire did a ground loop, ripping {{off one of the}} undercarriage legs and forcing the other up through the port main plane. The commanding officer (CO) excused Johnson, for the [...] "short airfield" [...] was difficult to land on for an inexperienced pilot. Johnson got the impression, however, that he would be watched closely, and felt that if he made another mistake, he would be [...] "certainly washed out". Johnson tried <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>the</b> injured shoulder with wool, held in place by adhesive tape. He also tightened the straps to reduce vibrations. Johnson found he had lost his [...] "feel" [...] in his right hand, and it became numb. When he practised dives, the pressure also aggravated his shoulder. He often tried to fly using his left hand only, but the Spitfire would have to be handled with both hands during anything other than simple manoeuvres. Despite the difficulties with his injuries, on 28 August 1940, the course was complete. Johnson had 205.25 hours on operational types including 23.50 on the Spitfire.|$|E

AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine observes [...] "Far from sounding as if they're grasping at straws, Linkin Park seem rejuvenated, proving there is {{value in the}} cliché of returning to roots." [...] Dan Epstein from Revolver described the album as [...] "...not only the hardest and heaviest thing they've ever released, but it's also their first album <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>the</b> sort of guitar firepower that would actually appeal to your average headbanger." [...] Epstein concludes by stating that it's proof that bands don't need to get softer in order to mature.

They attack record companies, politicians, rule makers, exes, and anyone else in sight, all the while rediscovering the savage fun of super-loud guitars." [...] Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph stated [...] "...it is sleek, exciting and committed enough to suggest there is life in the rock beast yet." [...] Jordan Blum at PopMatters rated it a 5/10, describing it as a [...] "solid album", but considers it [...] "too repetitive, uninspired, and generic", compared to the three previous albums. Rolling Stone reviewer Jon Dolan states that [...] "on Album Six they're back with a retro-neo-aggro sound that would've been too intense for modern-rock radio in 1999...these dudes can still bring it like backward-ball-cap warriors hopped up on Mountain Dew and Dad's fourth divorce." ...|$|E
