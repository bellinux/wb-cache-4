5|$|Argento {{reportedly}} {{offered the}} lead role of Peter Neal to Christopher Walken, but eventually it went to Anthony Franciosa. Kim Newman felt that Franciosa's casting was fortunate, as {{he was capable of}} bringing more to the role than the script asked of him. He also believed that if Walken had been cast, it would have been more obvious that he was the killer. According to Jones and Daria Nicolodi, the relationship between Franciosa and Argento was a fractious one. In addition, Nicolodi and Argento were romantically involved at the time, but their relationship had suffered over a disputed story credit during the filming of Suspiria. Nicolodi therefore only agreed to a brief appearance in Tenebrae. By her own account, she originally asked for the small role of Jane McKerrowwhich ultimately went to Veronica Lario. Nicolodi was, according to Alan Jones, cast as <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beach in Neal's flashback. Conversely, Thomas Rostock opines that Nicolodi was never intended for that role, only that of Jane. Transgender actress Eva Robin's was later hired to play <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beach.|$|E

Believing Alison to be <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone, Sarah drives to her address and follows her van to a soccer field, where she discovers that Alison is another of her lookalikes. Alison confronts Sarah, assuming that she is Beth, and refuses to believe Sarah when she explains that Beth killed herself, telling her to leave and wait for another call.|$|E

5|$|In similar fashion, many leading {{directors}} {{made one}} or more films at RKO during this era, including Alfred Hitchcock once more, with Notorious, and Jean Renoir, with This Land Is Mine (1943), reuniting Laughton and O'Hara, and <b>The</b> <b>Woman</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Beach (1947). John Ford's The Fugitive (1947) and Fort Apache (1948), which appeared right before studio ownership changed hands again, were followed by She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) and Wagon Master (1950); all four were co-productions between RKO and Argosy Pictures, the company run by Ford and RKO alumnus Merian C. Cooper. Of the directors under long-term contract to RKO in the 1940s, the best known was Edward Dmytryk, who first came to notice with the remarkably profitable Hitler's Children (1943). Shot on a $205,000 budget placing it in the bottom quartile of Big Five studio productions, {{it was one of}} the ten biggest Hollywood hits of the year. Another low-cost war-themed film directed by Dmytryk, Behind the Rising Sun, released a few months later, was similarly profitable.|$|E

The Renoirs had three sons: Pierre Renoir (1885-1952), who became a stage and film actor; Jean Renoir (1894-1979), who became a filmmaker of note; and Claude Renoir (1901-1969), who became a ceramic artist.|$|E

500|$|Later in the film, Barton places {{into the}} frame a small picture of Charlie, dressed in a fine suit and holding a briefcase. The {{juxtaposition}} of his neighbor in the uniform of an insurance salesman and the escapist image of <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beach leads to a confusion of reality and fantasy for Barton. Critic Michael Dunne notes: [...] "iewers can only wonder how 'real' Charlie is.... In the film's final shot... viewers must wonder how 'real' [...] is. The question leads to others: How real is Fink? Lipnick? Audrey? Mayhew? How real are films anyway?" ...|$|E
500|$|The picture's {{significance}} {{has been}} the subject of broad speculation. Washington Post reviewer Desson Howe said that despite its emotional impact, the final scene [...] "feels more like a punchline for punchline's sake, a trumped-up coda". In her book-length analysis of the Coen brothers' films, Rowell suggests that Barton's fixation on the picture is ironic, considering its low culture status and his own pretensions toward high culture (speeches to the contrary notwithstanding). She further notes that the camera focuses on Barton himself as much as the picture while he gazes at it. At one point, the camera moves past Barton to fill the frame with <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beach. This tension between objective and subjective points of view appears again at the end of the film, when Barton finds himself– [...] in a sense– [...] inside the picture.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Atlas Society, Ross related that her approach to Eve was inspired by Ayn Rand's objectivist philosophy. She said that Eve was [...] "always willing to make sacrifices, and there's always somebody willing, as Ayn Rand said, to take any sacrifices you {{might be willing to}} make." [...] She compared Eve to Catherine Halsey in Rand's 1943 novel, The Fountainhead, particularly around the middle of the novel, before Catherine [...] "was completely destroyed". Ross described Eve as [...] "a self-sacrificing animal", and emphasized that her character was distinct from her own self-identification as an individualist. Ross said that her portrayal of Eve was also influenced by Eve White, a character with dissociative identity disorder played by Joanne Woodward in the 1957 film The Three Faces of Eve. The actress researched books on sociopaths and psychopaths to help her approach Eve's desire to hide her past at any cost. During the filming process, she kept a diary to help her better understand how to approach future scenes. Ross also used the 2001 novel [...] to inform her interpretation of Eve's past. She expressed surprise that Eve's relationship with Julian was [...] "a real short courtship" [...] that turned the character from [...] "the innocent girl to <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Studio 54 dance floor having sex". After adjusting her perception of Eve's past, Ross chose to play the character's descent into drugs and prostitution as [...] "more immediate, wild and impulsive" [...] and [...] "very untamed and unrestrained".|$|E

In 1989, the Los Angeles Daily News stated that: [...] "Darlene has become {{as much a part of}} Ice-T's image as gangs, guns and boom boxes." [...] Ortiz originally met Ice-T when she was 17, stating she was [...] "totally smitten and ready to settle down" [...] and that she [...] "would've done whatever he asked". Of her appearance on the album cover she explained that it was [...] "like nothing" [...] for her. To prepare for the cover, Ortiz bought five different bathing suits and went to the photo studio with Glen E. Friedman. Ortiz felt comfortable with the sawed-off shotgun, stating that she got her first gun when she was 11 years old and that she thought [...] "it would be a powerful statement to see a woman holding a gun". Ice-T chose the bathing suit and the red high heel pumps and earrings for the cover. Clothing on the cover was shared between shots. Ortiz and DJ Evil E both shared the gold bracelet for the photo shoot and Ice-T and DJ Evil E wore the same Rolex. Ortiz also appeared in music videos for the singles from Power – [...] "I'm Your Pusher" [...] and [...] "High Rollers".|$|E
