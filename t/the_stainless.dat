5|$|He {{applied for}} another patent on an alloy he called {{stainless}} steel, {{now known as}} martensitic stainless steel. The Patent Office rejected his application {{saying that it was}} not a new alloy. Haynes conceded their point, but submitted a second application and supplied a sample showing the stainlessness of his alloy when created using his exact proportions of metals, and it was granted. At the urging of his wife, he created the first set of stainless steel silverware for her personal use. The first piece of stainless steel was forged by Homer Dan Farmer in Haynes laboratory. It was a large meat knife and was donated to the Haynes Museum by the family of Dan Heflin, grandson of Homer Dan Farmer. In later years he claimed to have created stainless steel because she did not enjoy polishing their silver tableware. British metallurgist Harry Brearley independently produced an identical alloy around the same time and applied for an American patent and found that one already existed. Brearley had also created other innovations for the metal, but they were of little value without <b>the</b> <b>stainless</b> steel patent. He sought out Haynes and the two decided to pool their findings in a single company to produce the alloy. Haynes sold his stainless steel patent in 1918 to the American Stainless Steel Company, a company Brearley had created with the assistance of investors in Pennsylvania. In exchange he and his estate received royalties on its production until the patent expired in 1930. The stock he received as payment allowed him to gain a seat among the company's board of directors and he installed his son, March, to represent him. The income from the transaction led Haynes to begin the accumulation of a large fortune.|$|E

40|$|In this report, the {{relation}} between the oxide formation and the pickling behaviour of duplex stainless steels is investigated. A duplex stainless steel 2205 (EN 1. 4462), and two single phases, ferritic and austenitic <b>stainless</b> steels with <b>the</b> same composition as the phases inside the 2205, have been annealed. The surface and composition of the oxide have been analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDS), focused ion beam (FIB) and glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GDOES). The thickness of the oxide scales increased when the annealing time and temperature were increased. <b>The</b> ferritic <b>stainless</b> steel has <b>the</b> thickest oxide, whereas the austenitic has the thinnest one. Nodules {{in the middle of the}} grains and thick oxides on the grain boundaries are observed on <b>the</b> austenitic <b>stainless</b> steel but also in a lower content on the austenitic phase of duplex <b>stainless</b> steel. <b>The</b> oxide scale on the 2205 is not homogenous, showing different types of oxide depending on the phase. The pickling behaviour of the same samples is also reviewed: oxide surface study and relative weight loss is discussed. <b>The</b> austenitic <b>stainless</b> steel has <b>the</b> highest pickling rate, followed by the 2205 and <b>the</b> ferritic <b>stainless</b> steel respectively. <b>The</b> oxide on <b>the</b> austenitic <b>stainless</b> steel is spalled from the surface mostly on the zones where nodules are placed, whereas the oxide on <b>the</b> ferritic <b>stainless</b> steel is dissolved during the process. The 2205 exhibit a mixture of both pickling behaviours: some grains are pickled fast, whereas in others the oxide still remains on the surface. The existence of thicker oxide on the top of grain boundaries, iron-enriched nodules with a porous structure, thick chromium depleted region and non protective silicon oxide could be attributed to the faster pickling rate on <b>the</b> austenitic <b>stainless</b> steel and <b>the</b> austenitic phase regions on the 2205.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effect of}} laser surface melting (LSM) on {{intergranular}} corrosion behaviour of aged austenitic stainless steels (UNS S 30400, S 31603, S 32100 and S 34700) and aged duplex stainless steels (UNS S 31803 and S 32950) were investigated. LSM of <b>the</b> aged <b>stainless</b> steels was carried out using a 2. 5. kW CW Nd:YAG laser. The microstructure of <b>the</b> aged <b>stainless</b> steels after LSM depends on their compositions. After LSM, <b>the</b> aged austenitic <b>stainless</b> steels mainly contain austenite (γ) with some ferrite (δ) as the minor phase, but the carbide phases are completely eliminated. For <b>the</b> aged duplex <b>stainless</b> steels after LSM, δ becomes the major phase and the δ/γ phase balance is disturbed, whereas the sigma (σ) phase is eliminated. The degree of sensitization (DOS) and corrosion morphology of <b>the</b> aged <b>stainless</b> steels before and after LSM were determined by the double loop electrochemical potentiokinetic reactivation (DL-EPR) using a potentiostat and SEM observation, respectively. Desensitization of <b>the</b> aged <b>stainless</b> steels has been successfully achieved by LSM and their intergranular corrosion resistance {{is found to be}} significantly enhanced as reflected by the decrease in DOS due to dissolution of the carbides or σ phase, which reduced Cr depletion or the possibility of solute segregation at the grain or phase boundaries, despite the presence of δ and disturbance of δ/γ phase balance.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{austenitic}} <b>stainless</b> steel 316 L {{has been}} compared to duplex stainless steels to be able to highlight a choice of material for manufacturing of spare tanks used for cooling water at nuclear power stations on the Swedish west coast. In this report 316 L and <b>the</b> duplex <b>stainless</b> steels 2205, 2304 and LDX 2404 have been compared according to corrosion resistance, strength, manufacturing aspects and prices. The steels arranged by increasing corrosion resistance: 316 L < 2304 < LDX 2404 < 2205. The steels arranged by increasing strength (considering the thickness of the plates needed for construction) : 316 L < 2304 < LDX 2404 and 2205. The steels arranged by increasing price/tank: 2304 < LDX 2404 < 2205 < 316 L.
