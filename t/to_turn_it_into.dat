5|$|Browne's {{interest}} in Amazing declined when the project <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a slick magazine was derailed. Although he stayed involved with Fantastic Adventures, another Ziff-Davis magazine, {{he left the}} editing work on Amazing to William Hamling and Lila Shaffer. In December 1950, when Ziff-Davis moved their offices from Chicago to New York, Hamling stayed behind in Chicago, and Browne revived his involvement with the magazine.|$|E

5|$|In 2011 {{the castle}} was sold for around £2 {{million to the}} Hay Castle Trust, who {{intended}} <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> an arts and education centre. The firm of Rick Mather Architects were taken on in 2015 to manage the work at a projected cost of £4.35 million, to include a new art gallery and a viewing point {{at the top of}} the keep. A grant of £528,600 from the Heritage Lottery Fund in 2014 supported initial planning, and further grants were given by the Country Houses Foundation and the Headley Trust.|$|E
5|$|Coastal erosion {{remained}} a problem. By {{the middle of}} the century, the tides had reached the southern edge of the castle, and a 1866 report stated that the walls had been undermined by the sea. Despite protective piles being driven around the castle, it was badly affected by flooding in 1875 and 1878, creating serious fissures in the stonework. The high costs of maintaining the property, combined with its dwindling utility, encouraged the government to sell the castle to the South Eastern Railway company in 1888, who intended <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a railway station. It was then sold to private owners and a small museum was created in the castle, which was sometimes opened to the public for an entry price of one penny.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, {{the actor}} {{screened}} his multimedia project entitled Three's Company The Drama, {{in which he}} merges video and art to update the former sitcom, at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. Franco reunited with Milk director Van Sant to make Unfinished, a project that features two movies: Endless Idaho and My Own Private River. Endless Idaho showcases edited outtakes, deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes footage from the 1991 movie My Own Private Idaho, while My Own Private River focuses on the late actor River Phoenix. The idea for the exhibition was conceived after Van Sant introduced unused footage from the 1991 film to Franco, inspiring him <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> something more. Unfinished opened from February 26 to April 9 at the Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills.|$|E

Title to {{the house}} then passed to their son, Albert, Jr., who sold it to a {{real-estate}} developer shortly after inheriting the home. After suggestions were proposed from razing the house for high-rise apartment buildings <b>to</b> <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the mayor’s residence, the Graham Foundation, then in its infancy, came forward to purchase the house.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the more}} {{immediate}} ideas for redevelopment of the base was <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a federal prison, something which had been done previously at the former Carswell AFB in Texas when the Federal Medical Center, Carswell was opened on its grounds. Many other former Air Force facilities have had prisons opened up on their grounds as well. From the outset, there was some reluctance in the town about turning it into creating a prison culture in Limestone, but this was lessened once the government decided {{that it did not}} want to build a federal prison {{on the grounds of the}} former air base.|$|E
5|$|The Palladium cinema {{was opened}} as the Empire in 1913 in a {{building}} which had previously been a brewery. It closed in 1993 and various attempts were made <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a club and shop, before Wetherspoons announced in January 2015 that they had acquired the site and intended to seek planning and licensing permission to convert it to a pub. The town was left without cinema for almost two decades. Cinema was {{brought back to the}} town under the Palladium name in 2012 with a new community cinema at the Town Hall. In 2013, permanent cinema equipment was installed in the building and there are now regular film screenings of both modern and classic films.|$|E
5|$|The {{experience}} encouraged Gaunt {{to further}} expand Dunstanburgh's defences {{over the next}} two years. A wide range of work was carried out {{under the direction of the}} constable, Thomas of Ilderton, and the mason Henry of Holme, including blocking up the entrance in the gatehouse <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a keep. In 1384 a Scottish army attacked the castle but they lacked siege equipment and were unable to take the defences. Gaunt lost interest in the property after he gave up his role as the Lieutenant of the Marches. Dunstanburgh Castle remained part of the Duchy of Lancaster, but the Duchy was annexed to the Crown when Gaunt's son, Henry IV, took the throne of England in 1399.|$|E

Later that year the Mentmore Towers project, which Halabi had purchased in 1997 with a view <b>to</b> <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a six-star hotel, ran into problems. The grade II listed building was mothballed, with essential maintenance work remaining undone as the project architects sued Halabi for unpaid fees.

5|$|The {{governors}} remained {{without an}} official residence until 1919 {{when the state}} purchased a home located at 101 East 27th St., Indianapolis, for $65,000 and furnished it for an additional $20,000. It was built by Henry Kahn in 1908 and had the design of an English country house. The home had a Gothic interior with high, beamed ceilings and luxurious Wilton carpeting. After a brief renovation, the home was inhabited by the governor starting in 1919 and remained so until 1945. The building was sold {{by the state to}} the Marott Hotel, which intended <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a clubhouse, but eventually demolished it in 1962 to clear land for a parking lot.|$|E
5|$|After a {{long night}} of drinking, Homer and Grampa awaken and {{discover}} that they bought the pub from Tom O'Flanagan during the previous night's binge, much to their shock and dismay. They rename the bar and try to continue running it but get no business and {{have to find a}} way to market their unwelcoming business. Homer gets help from Moe Szyslak, who suggests that they allow people to do illegal things in their pub. They find out that smoking is now banned from Irish pubs and Moe urges the Simpsons <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a smokeasy. They do a roaring trade, but are closed down by the Irish authorities. As a punishment, Homer and Grampa are deported back to America and have to pay a small fine. Chief Wiggum arrives to bring them back to the U.S., but accidentally hits himself with his nightstick and then Maces and Tasers himself.|$|E
5|$|Each level casts {{players as}} a {{different}} colored Yoshi, who must escort Baby Mario {{on his back}} and reach the end of the level, where he is passed on to the next Yoshi. Similar to Super Mario World, Yoshi can use his tongue to ensnare enemies and put them into his mouth. When something is in his mouth, Yoshi can either spit it out as an attack, or swallow it <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> an egg. These eggs can then be thrown at an angle, even bouncing off walls, to attack enemies or reach far away or hard to reach items. Yoshi can carry up to six eggs at a time, with some colored eggs spawning items once they hit something. Yoshi can also eat watermelons that let him spit out seeds, or flaming enemies that let him spit out fire. Yoshi is also able to perform a flutter jump, in which he can kick his legs in mid-air to gain extra height or hover over long distances, and a ground pound, a downward attack that can hammer down on enemies and stumps.|$|E

5|$|In {{southern}} Palestine the wet {{season was}} approaching with another thunderstorm and heavy {{rain on the}} night of 11 November. The dark cotton soil over which the Egyptian Expeditionary Force was now advancing would not need much more rain <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> impassable mud. But 12 November had been fine and the roads had dried out. The rolling maritime plain was dotted with villages on low hill tops surrounded by groves and orchards. These were in turn surrounded by hedges of prickly pear or cactus, making them strong natural places of defence. In the distance to the right the spurs and valleys of the Judean Hills were visible even to the invading British Empire troops near the Mediterranean coast. On 13 November the weather was clear and fine with at first no sign of the Ottoman Army.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} {{success of}} Xenosaga Episode I prompted Namco to offer then more support, with Namco's then-Vice President Yoichi Haraguchi {{to name the}} company as a valuable development partner alongside Namco Tales Studio. A manga adaptation was written by Atsushi Baba and published through Monthly Comic Zero Sum. The manga was released by the comic's publisher Ichijinsha across three volumes between 2004 and 2006. Following the release of Episode I, a supplementary disc was created titled Xenosaga Freaks. Released on April 28, 2004, Freaks is split into four segments; a visual novel segment featuring multiple characters from the game, a minigame dubbed XenoPitten, a dictionary that explains the game's terminology, and a demo for the game's official sequel. Freaks {{was part of a}} movement with the Xenosaga series <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a multimedia franchise, with the project growing substantially larger than previously planned.|$|E

60|$|One very {{important}} {{result of the}} Washington Conference is the agreement not to fortify islands in the Pacific, with certain specified exceptions. This agreement, if it is adhered to, will make war between America and Japan very difficult, unless we were allied with America. Without a naval base somewhere near Japan, America could hardly bring naval force {{to bear on the}} Japanese Navy. It had been the intention of the Navy Department to fortify Guam with a view <b>to</b> <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a first-class naval base. The fact that America has been willing to forgo this intention must be taken as evidence of a genuine desire to preserve the peace with Japan.|$|R

50|$|The {{newspaper}} was particularly important during the editorship of Ola Thommessen. In addition <b>to</b> <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a daily newspaper, he consolidated its {{ties with the}} Liberal Party (founded 1884), giving Verdens Gang a strong position in the political scene. Internationally known writers like Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and Georg Brandes contributed to the newspaper. When Thommessen left in 1910, Verdens Gang declined rapidly, as he brought much of the staff with him, immediately forming a competitor Tidens Tegn. The background was a conflict between Thommessen and Olaf Madsen, an important shareholder {{and member of the}} board of directors. Madsen's primary goal was economic profit, and according to Thommessen, Madsen meddled in the affairs of the newspaper, inflicting upon the editorial independence.|$|R
