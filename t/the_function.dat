Even if the Taylor series has positive convergence radius, the resulting series may not {{coincide with the}} function; but if <b>the</b> <b>function</b> is analytic then the series converges pointwise to <b>the</b> <b>function,</b> and uniformly on every compact subset of the convergence interval. Concerning the Fourier series, if <b>the</b> <b>function</b> is square-integrable then the series converges in quadratic mean, but additional requirements are needed to ensure the pointwise or uniform convergence (for instance, if <b>the</b> <b>function</b> is periodic and of class C1 then the convergence is uniform).|$|E

5|$|Besides {{being criticized}} for its limited powers, {{there is also}} some concern that the Council's {{responsibilities}} may go too far.

Even though the Council has the additional advantage of identifying potentially unconstitutional legislation at an early stage, thereby preventing unnecessary litigation in the future, there is doubt as to the ability of the Council to take on such a task. Given that constitutional interpretation is traditionally <b>the</b> <b>function</b> of lawyers and the courts, the task may be best carried out by the legally trained members of the PCMR.|$|E
