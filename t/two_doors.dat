5|$|The Bank of New Zealand Building, 205 Princes St (cnr. Princes and High Sts) (Category I). Designed in Venetian Renaissance styling, the 1882 BNZ {{building}} stands just <b>two</b> <b>doors</b> along {{from the}} National Bank building. The William Armson-designed building is notable for the richly carved exterior work by Louis Godfrey and moulded ceilings in its interior. The façade combines Doric, Ionic and Corinthian styles, and makes {{good use of}} Port Chalmers bluestone and Oamaru stone, a compact, cream-coloured limestone.|$|E
5|$|The Christian Scientists came in. Before {{they sat}} down, they stood on chairs {{and closed the}} transoms over the <b>two</b> <b>doors</b> to the rooms. Then they made their demand: the series must not be published. S.S. scowled at them and said nothing. To fill the silence, Brynner began rather nervously to assure the Scientists that the {{articles}} were not sensational, not offensive; {{that there was no}} cause for apprehension; that all the facts had been most carefully verified.One of the Scientists cut in to suggest that perhaps there would be no objection to publication of the material if the Scientists were permitted to edit it as they might please.|$|E

50|$|The Fox was {{a variant}} of the Gol {{manufactured}} by Volkswagen do Brasil and marketed by Volkswagen in North America as an entry level subcompact from 1987 to 1993. Initially offered as a <b>two</b> <b>door</b> and four door sedan as well as a <b>two</b> <b>door</b> wagon, the wagon was discontinued in 1991 along with the <b>two</b> <b>door</b> for the Canadian market, the same year the four door sedan (as well as the <b>two</b> <b>door,</b> in the United States) received a mild restyling.|$|R
5|$|The Fakahani Mosque exemplifies this process. It {{was built}} in the Fatimid period, either as a {{suspended}} mosque (one with shops underneath it) or with a high basement. After the earthquake of 1302 it was rebuilt. In 1440 an ablution basin was added, and early in the Ottoman period a minaret was built. The amir Ahmad Katkhuda Mustahfazan al-Kharbutli in 1735 ordered a major reconstruction, almost all of the original building being replaced apart from <b>two</b> <b>doors.</b> These finely carved doors were registered as a historical monument in 1908 by the committee of conservation, and the building itself was registered in 1937.|$|E
5|$|The {{most unusual}} {{feature of the}} throne hall is the small porch, {{projecting}} out {{at the front of}} the building. Under this porch stands the Busabok Mala Throne (พระที่นั่งบุษบกมาลา), whose spire echoes that of the larger building itself. The high base of the throne is surrounded by praying deities. During the reign of King Rama I, the throne was used when the king appeared before his vassal states; later it was used for certain ceremonies. The <b>two</b> <b>doors</b> to the hall is situated at the sides of the throne.|$|E
5|$|<b>Two</b> <b>doors</b> at the {{south-east}} and south-west {{corners of}} the courtyard led to a small hypostyle hall with four pairs of red granite pillars. Beyond were storage chambers and the inner sanctum with three (Ricke) or five (Lauer) statue niches where statues of the king would have been placed, facing the pyramid to the north. Contrary to other mortuary temples, the inner sanctum was thus separated from the pyramid by the courtyard. The only remains of the mortuary temple that are visible today are its basalt paving and the large granite blocks framing the outer door.|$|E
50|$|When {{launched}} at {{the start}} of 1934 the car came with a choice between a small <b>two</b> <b>door</b> “Limousine” (sedan/saloon) with a recommended price of 2,750 Marks and small <b>two</b> <b>door</b> “Cabrio-Limousine” which was effectively a <b>two</b> <b>door</b> sedan/saloon with a canvas foldable roof, available for only 2,650 Marks. Comparisons with the smaller engined DKW Meisterklasse F4 were unavoidable: DKW’s recommended price for the DKWs was 2,500 Marks and 2,600 Marks respectively for their Limousine and Cabrio-Limousine bodied cars.|$|R

5|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of 3 May, the niece {{of the woman who}} lived directly above the McCanns was sitting on her aunt's balcony, when she saw a man leave through the gate below, as though he had come out of a ground-floor apartment. What caught her attention was that he looked around before shutting the gate quietly, with both hands. At 14:30 two blonde-haired men were seen on the balcony of 5C, an empty apartment <b>two</b> <b>doors</b> from 5A. At 16:00–17:00 a blonde-haired man was seen near 5A. At 18:00 the same or another blonde-haired man was seen in the stairwell of the McCanns' block. At 23:00, after the disappearance, two blonde-haired men were seen in a nearby street speaking in raised voices. When they realized they had been noticed, they reportedly lowered their voices and walked away.|$|E
5|$|The {{rear face}} is plainer, with no jewels, but still highly decorated; Cherry speculates {{that it may}} {{originally}} {{have been much more}} simple and not designed for viewing, with most of the other elements added after it was originally made. At the top is a medallion with the face of Christ set in a sunburst. The central round-topped area contains <b>two</b> <b>doors,</b> secured with a small gold pin, containing full-length gold figures in relief, chased in gold, a feature unique to this reliquary. On the left door is the archangel Saint Michael, spearing a dragon representing the devil. He was both the patron saint of the French monarchy, and also traditionally the person responsible for supervising the chaotic crowds at the Last Judgement, when he is often shown in art weighing souls in a pair of scales. On the right is Saint Christopher, carrying the Christ child on his shoulders, who raises his hand in blessing. There was a popular belief that sight of an image of Saint Christopher meant that a person would not die on that day without receiving the Last Rites, which may well explain his presence here.|$|E
25|$|Strategic {{dominance}} {{links the}} Monty Hall {{problem to the}} game theory. In the zero-sum game setting of Gill, 2011, discarding the non-switching strategies reduces the game to the following simple variant: the host (or the TV-team) decides {{on the door to}} hide the car, and the contestant chooses <b>two</b> <b>doors</b> (i.e., the <b>two</b> <b>doors</b> remaining after the player's first, nominal, choice). The contestant wins (and her opponent loses) if the car is behind one of the <b>two</b> <b>doors</b> she chose.|$|E
50|$|The car {{was offered}} as a four door “Berline” sedan/saloon and as a <b>two</b> <b>door</b> “Coach” sedan/saloon. There was also a {{sporting}} bodied “Roadster” and a <b>two</b> <b>door</b> five seater “Cabriolet”. However, the “Roadster” and “Coach” bodied cars were delisted in 1935, leaving just the four door “Berline” and the “Cabriolet”.|$|R

25|$|The AMC AMX-GT is {{concept car}} {{developed}} by American Motors Corporation (AMC) for the 1968 show car circuit. The {{design of the}} grand touring-type rear-wheel drive pillarless coupe of monocoque construction with <b>two</b> <b>doors</b> and a truncated rear end treatment was influenced by AMC stylist Richard A. Teague.|$|E
25|$|<b>Two</b> <b>doors</b> per {{carriage}} per side. Being significantly wider {{they were}} theorised {{to be slightly}} more efficient in loading and unloading passengers, although this is disputed by some sources, who believe the fewer doors lead to longer platform dwell times compared to the three smaller doors in other Melbourne trains.|$|E
25|$|This {{technique}} provides insights {{in other}} situations {{such as the}} Monty Hall problem, a game show scenario in which a car is hidden behind one of three doors, and two goats are hidden as booby prizes behind the others. Once the contestant has chosen a door, the host opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat, eliminating that door as an option. With only <b>two</b> <b>doors</b> left (one with the car, the other with another goat), the player must decide to either keep their decision, or switch and select the other door. Intuitively, one might think the player is choosing between <b>two</b> <b>doors</b> with equal probability, and that the opportunity to choose another door makes no difference. But probability spaces reveal that the contestant has received new information, and can increase their chances of winning by changing to the other door.|$|E
