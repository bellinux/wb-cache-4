40|$|The {{problem was}} the lack of {{effective}} succession planning strategies to facilitate the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> technical <b>expertise</b> from retiring employees to younger employees. A rebound of oil exploration activities in Nigeria would adversely affect the drilling sector due to lack of preparation and succession planning to meet the demand for technical <b>expertise.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> this case study was to explore how a succession planning program contributes to knowledge <b>transfer</b> and development <b>of</b> <b>expertise</b> for business continuity and prevents loss of knowledge in the oil-drilling sector in Nigeria. Twenty-four participants from one oil-drilling contractor in Nigeria participated in the study. The conceptual framework was guided by knowledge creation theory, succession planning concepts, and transformational leadership theory. Data collection included semistructured face-to-face interviews supplemented with document review. Data analysis involved a traditional text method where data coder pace each piece of data into various categories by hand. This study revealed 4 themes: individual development program, mentoring, on-the-job training, and 360 -degree communication. Findings may affect oil-drilling practices by contributing to enhanced succession planning and knowledge transfer initiatives. The implication for positive social change may include the development of individuals for leadership roles and could add to the organization talent bench, and reduce knowledge gaps while ensuring business continuity...|$|R

After a series of scientific expeditions to the Antarctic produced convincing evidence that the ozone hole was indeed caused by chlorine and bromine from manmade organohalogens, the Montreal Protocol was strengthened at a 1990 meeting in London. The participants agreed to phase out CFCs and halons entirely (aside from a very small amount marked for certain [...] "essential" [...] uses, such as asthma inhalers) by 2000 in non-Article 5 countries and by 2010 in Article 5 (less developed) signatories.

At the same meeting, methyl bromide (MeBr), a fumigant used primarily in agricultural production, {{was added to the}} list of controlled substances. For all substances controlled under the protocol, phaseout schedules were delayed for less developed ('Article 5(1)') countries, and phaseout in these countries was supported by <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>expertise,</b> technology, and money from non-Article 5(1) Parties to the Protocol. Additionally, exemptions from the agreed schedules could be applied for under the Essential Use Exemption (EUE) process for substances other than methyl bromide and under the Critical Use Exemption (CUE) process for methyl bromide.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Implicit {{learning}} {{involves the}} largely unconscious learning of dynamic statisti-cal patterns and features, {{which leads to}} the development of tacit knowledge. This kind of learning is a ubiquitous, robust phenomenon that likely occurs in most, if not all, tasks in which individuals engage throughout their lives. In this paper, we argue that implicit learning and its end state, tacit knowledge, may assist in the acquisition, reten-tion, and <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>expertise</b> and thus provide a form of tacit scaffolding for expertise development. The notion of tacit scaffolding represents a novel and interesting area of future research for the field of naturalistic decision making and naturalistic cognition...|$|E

A knowledge model {{is similar to a}} concept map, except that it is based on a typology of knowledge objects and on a typology of links, and its structure is not necessarily hierarchical. This technique is used to represent concepts, principles, procedures and facts related to a specific aspect of the work done by employees in the organization.

40|$|A {{hallmark}} <b>of</b> perceptual <b>expertise</b> is {{that experts}} classify objects {{at a more}} specific, subordinate level of abstraction than novices. To what extent, does subordinate level learning contribute to the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> perceptual <b>expertise</b> to novel exemplars and novel categories? In this study, participants learned to classify ten varieties of wading birds and ten varieties of owls at either the subordinate, species (e. g., “white crown heron,” “screech owl”) or family (“wading bird”, “owl”) level of abstraction. During the six days of training, the amount of visual exposure was equated such that participants received {{an equal number of}} learning trials for wading birds and owls. Pre- and post-training performance was measured in a “same/different ” discrimination task in which participants judged whether pairs of bird stimuli belonged to the “same ” or “different” species. Participants trained in species level discrimination demonstrated greater transfer to novel exemplars and novel species categories than participants trained in family level discrimination. These findings suggest that perceptual categorization, not perceptual exposure per se, is important for the development and generalization <b>of</b> visual <b>expertise...</b>|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{a strategy for}} collaborative knowledge modelling between experts and novices {{in order to support}} the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>expertise</b> within organisations. The use of an object-typed knowledge modelling software tool called MOT is advocated, to elaborate knowledge models in small groups composed of experienced and less experienced employees within organisations. A knowledge model is similar to a concept map, except that it is based on a typology of links and knowledge objects. This technique is used to help experts externalise their knowledge pertaining to concepts, principles, procedures and facts related to their work and to support the sharing of knowledge with novice employees. This chapter presents the rationale behind this strategy, the tool used, the applications of this method {{and the manner in which}} it can be integrated into a global knowledge management strategy within organisations...|$|E
