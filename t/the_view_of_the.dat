5|$|Nearly {{a decade}} after the Tagora had ceased production, <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car in the {{automotive}} press was that it was merely average though there was little actively wrong with the car. The view was that the Tagora had the advantage of refinement, good manners and, in V6 form, good performance. Rust was identified as the single biggest problem for the surviving cars, usually around the rear suspension mountings. Buckley suggested that the car might attain collectible status by 2003.|$|E

5|$|The fourth marquess, John Crichton-Stuart, was an {{enthusiastic}} restorer and builder and commissioned a major restoration project between 1928 and 1939. The stonework was carefully repaired, with moulds made to recreate missing pieces. The Inner East Gatehouse was rebuilt, {{along with several}} of the other towers. The marquess carried out landscaping work, {{with the intent of}} eventually re-flooding the lakes, and thanks to several decades of purchases was finally able to demolish the local houses encroaching on <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle.|$|E
5|$|The mosques at Gedi {{contained}} {{wells and}} washing facilities, {{which would have}} been used for cleansing prior to worship. However, they were not constructed with minarets used for the call to prayer, which was more characteristic in other regions. Gedi's mosques were typically laid out with anterooms flanking the central room, which had a roof supported by wood beams resting on square stone pillars.

5|$|These repressive {{measures}} included taking prominent Serbs hostage against Serb attacks. To {{avoid being}} {{taken as a}} hostage, Stojanović paid 100,000 dinars to the Ustaše in Prijedor.

5|$|To avert war then, the Kentucky General Assembly {{called for}} a meeting of border states to convene in Frankfort on May 27.

5|$|A {{secondary}} control input that the rider can make is to lean the upper torso {{relative to the}} bike. As mentioned above, the effectiveness of rider lean varies inversely with {{the mass of the}} bike. On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, rider lean mostly alters the ground clearance requirements in a turn, improves <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road, and improves the bike system dynamics in a very low-frequency passive manner. In motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, moving the body, and projecting a knee {{to the inside of the}} turn relative to the bike can also cause an aerodynamic yawing moment that facilitates entering and rounding the turn.|$|E
5|$|Antoinism {{believes}} in a dualistic universe {{composed of a}} spiritual world governed by the law of God or consciousness, and of a corporal world, governed by natural laws, in which matter is an illusion perceived by the imagination generated by intelligence. The man combines in himself both worlds, as he has a physical body and a divine consciousness. In Antoinist views, the importance of human laws and science is weakened as they are based not on consciousness, but on intelligence. <b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matter is, however, not considered a sin, but an error that causes suffering.|$|E
5|$|As decolonisation {{proceeded}} {{throughout the}} British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject English but rather {{continued to use}} it as independent countries setting their own language policies. For example, <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English language among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress, and English continues to be an official language of India. English is also widely used in media and literature, and the number of English language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK. However English is rarely spoken as a first language, numbering only around a couple hundred-thousand people, and less than 5% of the population speak fluent English in India. David Crystal claimed in 2004 that, combining native and non-native speakers, India now has more people who speak or understand English than {{any other country in the}} world, but the number of English speakers in India is very uncertain, with most scholars concluding that the United States still has more speakers of English than India.|$|E

Beneath the Canongate Building façade is the Canongate Wall, constructed from a variety of indigenous Scottish rocks such as Lewisian gneiss, Torridonian sandstone and Easdale slate. The stones are set into large concrete casts, each one inscribed with a quotation. The Canongate Wall contains a total of 24 quotations.

He stood with his heels almost together and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary.

Photographs taken by the spacecraft showed the comet to be more dusty and less icy than had been expected.
