5|$|After the {{departure}} of Massasoit and his men, Squanto remained in Plymouth to teach the Pilgrims how to survive in New England, for example using dead fish <b>to</b> <b>fertilize</b> the soil. For {{the first few years}} of colonial life, the fur trade was the dominant source of income, buying furs from Native Americans and selling to Europeans, beyond subsistence farming. Shortly after {{the departure}} of the Mayflower, Governor Carver suddenly died. William Bradford was elected to replace him and went on to lead the colony through much of its formative years.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture {{also made}} up an {{important}} part of the Plymouth economy. The colonists adopted Native American agricultural practices and crops. They planted maize, squash, pumpkins, beans, and potatoes. Besides the crops themselves, the Pilgrims learned productive farming techniques from the Native Americans, such as proper crop rotation and the use of dead fish <b>to</b> <b>fertilize</b> the soil. In addition to these native crops, the colonists also successfully planted Old World crops such as turnips, carrots, peas, wheat, barley, and oats.|$|E

5|$|Another {{concern is}} the fact that {{sugarcane}} fields are traditionally burned just before harvest to avoid harm to the workers, by removing the sharp leaves and killing snakes and other harmful animals, and also <b>to</b> <b>fertilize</b> the fields with ash. Mechanization will reduce pollution from burning fields and has higher productivity than people, and due to mechanization the number of temporary workers in the sugarcane plantations has already declined. By the 2008 harvest season, around 47% of the cane was collected with harvesting machines.|$|E
5|$|Competition {{can play}} a part in the mating rituals of species such as burying beetles (Nicrophorus), the insects {{fighting}} to determine which can mate. Many male beetles are territorial and fiercely defend their territories from intruding males. In such species, the male often has horns on the head or thorax, making its body length greater than that of a female. Copulation is generally quick, but in some cases lasts for several hours. During copulation, sperm cells are transferred to the female <b>to</b> <b>fertilize</b> the egg.|$|E
5|$|The {{cervical}} canal is {{a passage}} through which sperm must travel <b>to</b> <b>fertilize</b> an egg cell after sexual intercourse. Several methods of contraception, including cervical caps and cervical diaphragms aim to block or prevent {{the passage of}} sperm through the cervical canal. Cervical mucus is used in several methods of fertility awareness, such as the Creighton model and Billings method, due to its changes in consistency throughout the menstrual period. During vaginal childbirth, the cervix must flatten and dilate to allow the fetus to progress along the birth canal. Midwives and doctors use {{the extent of the}} dilation of the cervix to assist decision-making during childbirth.|$|E

5|$|Temnospondyls, {{like all}} amphibians, {{reproduced}} in aquatic environments. Most temnospondyls probably reproduced through external fertilization. Like most living frogs, female temnospondyls would have laid masses of eggs in water while males released sperm <b>to</b> <b>fertilize</b> them. Several fossils were described from the Early Permian of Texas in 1998 {{that may be}} egg masses of dissorophoid temnospondyls. They were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs. The fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probably vitelline membranes and halo-like areas surrounding them that are most likely mucous coatings. They are attached to plant fossils, suggesting that these temnospondyls laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs. The mucous membranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians, not fish (their eggs lack mucous), but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs. The eggs {{are thought to be}} from dissorophoids because {{they are likely to be}} close relatives of modern amphibians, and probably had similar reproductive strategies. They are also the most common amphibians from the deposit in which the eggs were found.|$|E
5|$|The three remain undetected for two days, {{even as a}} {{probe and}} a group of the Martians {{themselves}} explore the basement. They also soon discover that the Martians are growing strange red-colored alien vegetation across the landscape and is quickly growing, covering trees and spreading into the basement, thus explaining the Martians' motives: to colonise Earth for their species, therefore making Earth a Mars-like planet. The next morning, Ogilvy suffers a mental breakdown after witnessing a Tripod harvesting human blood and tissue <b>to</b> <b>fertilize</b> the alien vegetation. Convinced that Ogilvy's mad shouting will alert the Martians to their location, Ray reluctantly kills him. The basement hideout is eventually exposed when a second probe catches them sleeping. Rachel is soon abducted by a nearby Tripod; Ray allows himself to be abducted, and is placed in the same cage with Rachel {{and a number of other}} prisoners. As the Tripod selects him for harvesting, Ray takes a belt of grenades into the machine in his place, having pulled out the pins. The Tripod is destroyed and releases the cage, with Ray and Rachel, and the other prisoners, making it out alive.|$|E
25|$|Females {{possess a}} spermatheca, an {{ectodermal}} gland which opens into the oviduct. These serve as storage for sperm deposited by males. It contains glands which can nourish the spermatozoa {{until they can}} be released <b>to</b> <b>fertilize</b> eggs.|$|E

25|$|Spawn {{consists}} of the reproductive cells (gametes) of many aquatic animals, some of which will become fertilized and produce offspring. The process of spawning typically involves females releasing ova (unfertilized eggs) into the water, often in large quantities, while males simultaneously or sequentially release spermatozoa (milt) <b>to</b> <b>fertilize</b> the eggs.|$|E
25|$|While some oysters {{have two}} sexes (European oyster and Olympia oyster), their {{reproductive}} organs contain both eggs and sperm. Because of this, it is technically possible for an oyster <b>to</b> <b>fertilize</b> its own eggs.

25|$|House centipedes live {{anywhere}} {{from three to}} seven years, depending on the environment. They can start breeding in their third year. To begin mating, {{the male and female}} circle around each other. They initiate contact with their antennae. The male deposits his sperm on the ground and the female then uses it <b>to</b> <b>fertilize</b> her eggs.|$|E
50|$|Mouthbrooding, {{also known}} as oral incubation, refers to the care given by some groups of animals <b>to</b> <b>fertilized</b> eggs or their {{offspring}} by holding them {{in the mouth of}} the parent for extended periods of time. Although it has been observed in a variety of animals, most mouthbrooders are fish. The parent performing this behavior invariably feeds less often and afterwards will be underweight, requiring a period of feeding and restoring the depleted energy reserves.|$|R

25|$|Spermatogenesis {{produces}} mature male gametes, {{commonly called}} sperm but more specifically known as spermatozoa, which are able <b>to</b> <b>fertilize</b> the counterpart female gamete, the oocyte, during conception {{to produce a}} single-celled individual known as a zygote. This {{is the cornerstone of}} sexual reproduction and involves the two gametes both contributing half the normal set of chromosomes (haploid) to result in a chromosomally normal (diploid) zygote.|$|E
40|$|We {{analyzed}} fertility {{patterns of}} 339 eggs laid 1985 - 93 at the International Crane Foundation by cranes whose sole means of fertility was artificial insemination (AI). Ten of 15 crane species were studied. Fertility rates increased significantly (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with (I) higher sperm density, (2) greater sperm motility, and (3) 2 vs. 1 vs. 0 inseminations 4 - 7 days before oviposition. Semen {{sample size was}} inversely related to sperm density and had no strong relationship with egg fertility. Inseminations less than 2. 5 - 3. 0 days before an egg is laid are probably too late <b>to</b> contribute <b>to</b> <b>fertilizing</b> the egg but may contribute substantially <b>to</b> <b>fertilizing</b> the next egg. We also describe practical knowledge gained during the past 10 years that apply to certain species or situations. Wattled cranes (Bugeranus carunculatus) have a long fertile period post-AI (up to 16 days), but may require more careful methods and special AI scheduling strategies. We also describe techniques for AI just after oviposition that are especially beneficial for Siberian cranes (Grus leucogeranus), and methods for maximizing sample delivery to the female...|$|R
40|$|While {{reprogramming}} {{a foreign}} nucleus after somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), the enucleated oocyte (ooplasm) must signal that biomass and cellular requirements changed {{compared to the}} nucleus donor cell. Using cells expressing nuclear-encoded but mitochondria-targeted EGFP, a strategy was developed to directly distinguish maternal and embryonic products, testing ooplasm demands on transcriptional and post-transcriptional activity during reprogramming. Specifically, we compared transcript and protein levels for EGFP and other products in pre-implantation SCNT embryos, side-by-side <b>to</b> <b>fertilized</b> controls (embryos produced from the same oocyte pool, by intracytoplasmic injection of sperm containing the EGFP transgene). We observed that while EGFP transcript abundance is not different, protein levels are significantly lower in SCNT compared <b>to</b> <b>fertilized</b> blastocysts. This was not observed for Gapdh and Actb, whose protein reflected mRNA. This transcript-protein relationship indicates that the somatic nucleus {{can keep up with}} ooplasm transcript demands, whilst transcription and translation mismatch occurs after SCNT for certain mRNAs. We further detected metabolic disturbances after SCNT, suggesting a place among forces regulating post-transcriptional changes during reprogramming. Our observations ascribe oocyte-induced reprogramming with previously unsuspected regulatory dimensions, in that presence of functional proteins may no longer be inferred from mRNA, but rather depend on post-transcriptional regulation possibl...|$|R

25|$|Tsetse flies are {{regarded}} as {{a major cause of}} rural poverty in sub-Saharan Africa because they prevent mixed farming. The land infested with tsetse flies is often cultivated by people using hoes rather than more efficient draught animals because nagana, the disease transmitted by tsetse, weakens and often kills these animals. Those cattle that survive produce little milk, pregnant cows often abort their calves, and manure is not available <b>to</b> <b>fertilize</b> the worn-out soils.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to this direct impact, the presence of tsetse and trypanosomiasis discourages the use of more-productive exotic and cross-bred cattle, depresses the growth and affects the distribution of livestock populations, reduces the potential opportunities for livestock and crop production (mixed farming) through less draught power to cultivate land and less manure <b>to</b> <b>fertilize</b> (in an environment-friendly way) soils for better crop production, and affects human settlements (people tend to avoid areas with tsetse flies).|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{examined}} the effects of certain pathological conditions on the sterility of breeding sows. Pathomorphological investigations were performed on 185 reproductive organs. We analyzed the reasons for elimination from local records. The biggest number of sows with pathological changes on reproductive organs were in the group of barren sows, 48. 68 % followed by anestric sows, 30. 26 %, and the smallest number in sows with failed fertilizations, 21. 05 %. Cysts in ovaries, ovarian tubes, oviducts and  the mesosalpinx were found in 23. 77 % of the examined sows. Lutein cysts were found in a significantly higher percentage in sows which fail <b>to</b> be <b>fertilized</b> than in barren or anestric animals. Small granular degeneration of the ovaries was determined in barren sows and those which cannot be fertilized, while it was not determined in anestric sows. Cysts on uterus ligaments and ovaries and on ovarian tubes and oviducts were found in significantly higher numbers in sows which fail be fertilized than in barren or anestric sows. Their presence can be connected to obstructions in the transport process of spermatozoa, eggs, and the fertilization process in sows which fail <b>to</b> be <b>fertilized,</b> especially in cases of cysts located on the very serosa of ovarian tubes which we found in these sows. We determined small granular degeneration of the ovaries in barren sows and those which fail <b>to</b> <b>fertilized,</b> but not in anestric sows. Ovarian insufficiency was mostly connected to anestric sows. Vaginitis, endometritis, periometritis and oocytis present an important factor in the occurrence of sterility primarily in sows which are barren or which fail <b>to</b> be <b>fertilized...</b>|$|R
