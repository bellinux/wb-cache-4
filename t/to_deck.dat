5|$|The Seafire, a name {{derived from}} sea, and Spitfire, was a naval {{version of the}} Spitfire {{specially}} adapted for operation from aircraft carriers. Although the Spitfire was not designed for the rough-and-tumble of carrier-deck operations, it was considered the best available fighter at the time. The basic Spitfire design did impose some limitations {{on the use of}} the aircraft as a carrier-based fighter; poor visibility over the nose, for example, meant that pilots had to be trained to land with their heads out of the cockpit and looking along the port cowling of their Seafire. Like the Spitfire, the Seafire also had a relatively narrow undercarriage track, which meant that it was not ideally suited <b>to</b> <b>deck</b> operations. Early marks of Seafire had relatively few modifications to the standard Spitfire airframe; however cumulative front line experience meant that most of the later versions of the Seafire had strengthened airframes, folding wings, arrestor hooks and other modifications, culminating in the purpose-built Seafire F/FR Mk 47.|$|E

25|$|The retry of Deck’s penalty phase {{began on}} April 29, 2003, {{where he was}} brought into court wearing shackles. The defense objected <b>to</b> <b>Deck</b> being visibly restrained, stating that Deck’s {{behavior}} did not justify shackles. The defense stated the only justification for shackling Deck {{would have been if}} he caused a disturbance in the courtroom. However, he did not. The defense also suggested other measures that the court could have taken to ensure safety instead of shackling Deck. These measures included adding extra security guards to the courtroom, and having the people who wanted to sit in the gallery walk through metal detectors. However, the defense’s objections were overruled. Deck’s attorneys once again objected during voir dire. Deck’s defense thought that asking jurors if the shackles biased them was not enough to ensure that Deck would receive reliable sentencing. The court overruled the objection again, stating “The objection that you’re making will be overruled. He has been convicted and will remain in legirons and belly chain.” The jury once again sentenced Deck to death.|$|E
25|$|Afterwards Dashwood took eight American merchantmen, and on 15 June 1812, he {{captured}} the Hope, a merchant ship off {{the north of}} Gothland. On 14 August 1812 he was appointed captain of HMS Cressy of 74 guns, and given a piece of plate by the officers of HMS Pyramus. After serving in the North Sea under Admiral Sir William Young, Dashwood escorted a convoy to the West Indies, whence he returned with another of equal importance. At {{the review of the}} fleet at Spithead, in the summer of 1814, he steered the Royal barge. Afterwards he took part, commanding HMS Norge of 74 guns, in the Battle of New Orleans, where he assisted Admiral Pulteney Malcolm in the debarkation of the army, being reported by Sir Alexander Cochrane. He was also present at the Battle of Lake Borgne, where a few gunboats of the Norge, in company with other small vessels, captured five American gunboats. In 1815, when at anchor in Port Royal, his ship was struck by lightning, which broke the main-topgallant-mast in three pieces, shivered the maintop-mast and brought the mizentop-mast and topgallant-mast down on <b>to</b> <b>deck.</b> In 1821 he was given command of HMS Windsor Castle of 74 guns, and HMS Impregnable, of 104 guns, as Cochrane's flag-captain. He recommissioned Windsor Castle on 4 January 1822, as part of the guard-ships in Hamoaze. In 1825 he was put onto half-pay, and was made a rear-admiral on 22 July 1830. He assumed the rank of vice-admiral on 23 November 1841. Charles died while at service, on 21 September 1847. Consequently, on 22 September 1847, the Admiralty promoted him posthumously to the rank of admiral.|$|E

During this time, RAN Sea Furies flew 1,623 sorties, while the Fireflies flew 743, with the aircraft using 802 bombs, 6,359 rockets, and 269,249 rounds of [...] ammunition between them. Three RAN pilots were killed and a fourth seriously wounded, while thirteen aircraft were lost: nine shot down by North Korean flak artillery (which damaged aircraft on over ninety other occasions), and four <b>to</b> <b>deck</b> accidents or foul weather.

About the pre-main event Lethal Lockdown match, Allely said, [...] "Lethal Lockdown was everything it should be, a full-throttle cage match where all hell breaks loose and the opposing teams finally {{get the chance to}} work through their differences with the cage and weapons as added extras". Overall he commented, “Bound for Glory was perhaps TNA's best offering of 2010”.|$|E

2500|$|Boat rudders may {{be either}} {{outboard}} or inboard. Outboard rudders are {{hung on the}} stern or transom. Inboard rudders are hung from a keel or skeg and are thus fully submerged beneath the hull, connected to the steering mechanism by a rudder post which comes up through the hull <b>to</b> <b>deck</b> level, often into a cockpit. [...] Inboard keel hung rudders (which are {{a continuation of the}} aft trailing edge of the full keel) are traditionally deemed the most damage resistant rudders for off shore sailing. [...] Better performance with faster handling characteristics can be provided by skeg hung rudders on boats with smaller fin keels.|$|E
2500|$|All of the {{interior}} liners are overlaid and bonded to the hull and deck and the hull <b>to</b> <b>deck</b> joint is bonded with adhesive and then mechanically fastened with stainless steel bolts through the signature C slotted aluminum toerail. The fixed elliptical fin keel has an eight percent foil at the root with reduced chord and an extended trailing edge-hull fillet for interference drag reduction, and an eleven percent foil at the tip to help lower the centre of gravity (VCG). A keel / centreboard combination is an option. The D/L ratio ranges from 206 to 231, depending on model. The opening transom of the + and XL model is simple to operate and transforms to a walk through transom / swim platform including an integral folding ladder providing {{easy access to the}} water. [...] The R version has an open transom.|$|E
2500|$|Buck {{planned to}} quit {{high school in}} 1941 to take a {{full-time}} job {{in an effort to}} support his family. Dissuaded by one of his teachers, Buck decided to finish high school, graduating from Lakewood High School in the winter of 1942. After graduation, he followed one of his friends and began working on an iron ore freight boat operated on the Great Lakes by the Cleveland Cliffs Iron Company. Buck served on a [...] steamer named [...] "The Sheadle", where he began as porter and was later promoted to night cook and baker.

A physical examination related to the deck watch application process revealed Buck was color blind, unable to differentiate between the colors green and brown. Ineligible for the promotion <b>to</b> <b>deck</b> watch, Buck subsequently became eligible for the military draft, and was drafted into the United States Army in June 1943.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{significant}} difference between the grain ship and tanker MACs was the provision of hangar space within the grain ships.

[...] An elevator platform could lift a fully loaded aircraft from hangar <b>to</b> <b>deck</b> level in less than a minute. [...] It was impracticable to fit tanker MACs with a hangar as this would have entailed very extensive structural alterations and a significant reduction in cargo capacity. [...] Although capable of operating four aircraft, tanker MACs normally embarked three, which all had to be kept on deck: [...] parked aircraft had to be moved to the forward end when other aircraft were landing on, and a collapsible safety barrier was fitted to prevent collisions. [...] Hinged side screens or 'palisades' were fitted around the aft end of the flight deck to provide weather protection for parked aircraft but with only limited effect.|$|E
2500|$|Next up, was {{an early}} {{standout}} performance by Cromwell in the role {{as the leader of}} the youth gang in Cecil B. DeMille's now cult-favorite, This Day and Age (1933). To ensure that Cromwell's character used current slang, DeMille asked high school student Horace Hahn to read the script and comment (at the time, Hahn was senior class president at Los Angeles High School). While again on loan from Columbia, Cromwell's by then salary of $200 per week was paid by Paramount Pictures, DeMille's studio. Diana Serra Cary, in her biography of Jackie Coogan, relates an episode on the set wherein Cromwell came to the aid of actress Judith Allen:I watched as he (DeMille) systematically reduced ingenue... Allen to screaming hysterics by calling her every insulting name in the book in front of company and crew simply to bring on tears... Cromwell was the only man on the set who dared confront the tryannical DeMille. White with rage, Cromwell stopped the scene and threatened <b>to</b> <b>deck</b> him if he didn't let up on the devastated girl. He (Cromwell) then drove her home himself.
