25|$|Homeless shelters {{often provide}} other {{services}} to <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>at</b> <b>large.</b> The classic {{example is the}} soup kitchen for persons who are not staying at the shelter. Others include support groups, and/or substance abuse treatment. If they do not offer any of these services, they can usually refer their clients to agencies that do. Supportive housing integrates services in a more assertive fashion. The typical pathway through the interlocking system is that a person may start in a shelter and move through transitional housing into supportive housing and finally independent housing.|$|E

They had found no sign of Leichhardt, and the country over which they travelled was useless for farming.

Ultimately, the expedition achieved very little, but it was of great personal advantage to Forrest whose reputation with his superiors and in <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>at</b> <b>large</b> was greatly enhanced.|$|E
25|$|Key parties {{involved}} in corporate governance include stakeholders {{such as the}} board of directors, management and shareholders. External stakeholders such as creditors, auditors, customers, suppliers, government agencies, and <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>at</b> <b>large</b> also exert influence. The agency view of the corporation posits that the shareholder forgoes decision rights (control) and entrusts the manager {{to act in the}} shareholders' best (joint) interests. Partly {{as a result of this}} separation between the two investors and managers, corporate governance mechanisms include a system of controls intended to help align managers' incentives with those of shareholders. Agency concerns (risk) are necessarily lower for a controlling shareholder.|$|E

25|$|Landscape {{archaeology}} is {{the study}} {{of the ways in which}} people in the past constructed and used the environment around them. Landscape archaeology is inherently multidisciplinary in its approach to the study of culture, and is used by pre-historical, classic, and historic archaeologists. The key feature that distinguishes landscape archaeology from other archaeological approaches to sites is that there is an explicit emphasis on the sites' relationships between material culture, human alteration of land/cultural modifications to landscape, and the natural environment. The study of landscape archaeology (also sometimes referred to as the archaeology of the cultural landscape) has evolved to include how landscapes were used to create and reinforce social inequality and to announce one's social status to <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>at</b> <b>large.</b>|$|E

In May 2005, the artist Gustavo LeClerc became the center's new artistic director, and was charged with broadening Self Help's horizons. The personnel changes may have been symptoms of larger problems. Benítez stepped down in March 2005 as a financial crisis became public knowledge. On June 7, 2005, the doors of Self Help were locked and the staff was dismissed. The unforeseen nature of the closure evoked an angry reaction from the artists affiliated with the center and <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>at</b> <b>large.</b> A series of meetings were held {{to ensure that the}} closure was only temporary and to pre-empt any potential future problems resulting from lack of funding or the lack of organizational transparency.|$|E
