500|$|Writing in The Guardian a {{fortnight}} later, ITV head of drama David Liddiment defended the decision, {{stating that the}} network had planned to let Making Waves profit from The Bills (the lead-in) high ratings {{at a time when}} BBC One Wednesday night ratings were suffering, but the series just [...] "wasn't good enough" [...] to hold an audience. Ted Childs later responded that Making Waves had received little publicity compared to Channel 4's ratings smash Supernanny, which aired opposite his series, and <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>that</b> programme had ended its run, the ratings for the last three episodes might have improved. He went on to question why ITV had spent £5 million on a series they knew would not be a hit. Making Waves had been another in a line of expensive series which had been cancelled because they performed below ITV's expectations in the ratings, following Sweet Medicine and Family the previous year.|$|E
500|$|Walton {{said that}} [...] "Jill is {{attracted}} to powerful men" [...] {{but is a}} [...] "bossy little lady" [...] who isn't going to [...] "buckle under" [...] to them. She romanced many of Katherine's husbands, including Rex Sterling (Quinn Redeker). Walton said that their romance was [...] "great" [...] but [...] "he only {{fell in love with}} her because the real Katherine had been spirited away and a fake Katherine was in her place". Walton described Jill's romance Sean Bridges (David Lee Russek), who was a young web designer, as a [...] "boy toy". Jill is known for infidelity, Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it noted that she has slept with Katherine's husbands and had an affair with Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) while she was married to his own father, John Abbott (Jerry Doulgas). Former head writer Kay Alden called her affair with Jack [...] "massive" [...] and it was [...] "devastating to both of them" [...] when it broke up her marriage to John. Lydna Hirsch of Sun Sentinel noted that after the affair, John threw Jack out of the house and divorced Jill; he forgave them years later but it took [...] "Jack being paralyzed and Jill dealing with the death of her son Philip to get him to come around". Several years later, Walton said that John was one of the character's [...] "best matches" [...] because [...] "Jill had a real love and respect for him – I just don't think she had the physical passion for him so she got restless." [...] Of her relationship with ex-con Larry Warton (Shark Fralick), Walton said: [...] "Larry Warton was hilarious; he was really, really fun. I loved doing <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> <b>that</b> was almost all comedy, all the time." ...|$|E
2500|$|That evening, angry {{youths in}} republican districts burnt hijacked {{vehicles}} and attacked the RUC. Immediately after the attack, {{the two main}} loyalist paramilitary groups—the UDA and the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF)—denied responsibility. The leader of the UDA West Belfast Brigade, Tommy Lyttle, said that Stone was a rogue loyalist acting without orders from the UDA, {{although he did not}} condemn the attack. Lyttle told other UDA leaders to keep to this line. UDA member Sammy Duddy said: [...] "After Milltown, two UDA brigadiers from two Belfast battalions telephoned the IRA to say they didn't know Michael Stone [...] But Michael was UDA, he was a travelling gunman who went after the IRA and Republicans and he needed no authority for <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>that</b> was his job. Those two brigadiers were scared in case the IRA would retaliate against them [...] so they disclaimed Michael, one of our best operators".|$|E

Now with its fabric-covered speakers, its peculiar yellow dials, its serrated knobs, it looks quaint and a little strange. Mr. Ed Lindsay is going to find out how strange very soon when he tunes in to the Twilight Zone." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{character}} was originally {{designed as a}} bad girl the audience could hate, but was later presented as a [...] "flawed good girl." [...] Havins preferred the character to be [...] "driven" [...] and said her [...] "all-time favorite Babe moments" [...] are when the {{character was}} being spunky. [...] "I love when she's pumped and she's like a cheerleader, seeing the good in everything," [...] she said. Of Babe's darker moments, Havins stated, [...] "My favorite moment of Babe down — just emotionally beat up and dragged through the dirt — {{would probably be the}} moment at the river with Krystal," [...] the moment Babe is told her baby has died. [...] "...I loved when Little Adam almost drowned [...] There was this vulnerable side of her that hadn't come out for a while," [...] she said. [...] "And I loved playing <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>that</b> was a range of emotions between loving your child, being scared to death, hating your husband for not being responsible, etc. There was not one set way of thought or feeling in those scenes." ...|$|E

6000|$|But more particularly, {{the word}} of righteousness--thy cause, {{within the bounds of}} which thou must keep, if thou wilt suffer for righteousness, is to be divided into two parts. (1.) It containeth a revelation of moral righteousness. (2.) It containeth a revelation of evangelical righteousness. As for moral righteousness, men seldom suffer; only, for <b>that.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>that</b> is the righteousness of the world, and that, simply as such, that sets itself up in every man's conscience, and has a {{testimony}} for itself, even in the light of nature. Besides, there is nothing that maketh head against that; but that which every man is ashamed, by words to plead for, and that is immorality. And this is that which Peter intends when he saith, [...] "And if ye be followers of that which is good, who will harm you?" [...] (1 Peter 3:13). If ye be followers of moral goodness. But if it should so happen, for the case is rare, that any man should make you sufferers because you love God, and do good to your neighbour, happy are ye. Though I do not think that the apostle's conclusion terminates there. But more of these things anon.|$|E

She later said: [...] "I don't recognise the Queen ... I don't think I was treated fairly, I don't think it was necessary. I called her <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>that's</b> her name." ...|$|R

5000|$|Valero was {{the biggest}} {{financial}} backer of the failed 2010 California Proposition 23 and contributed more than $4 million by August 2010.

Critics argued <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>that</b> had happened only three times over the last 40 years, the proposition would have had the practical effect of repealing the law.|$|E

While NHTSA indicated that fuel economy is calculated by measuring vehicular carbon emissions and that {{nearly all of the}} engineering options to reduce vehicular GHG emissions also improve fuel economy, these states argued <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>that</b> the use of alternative fuels could allow greenhouse gas emissions to be reduced somewhat independently of fuel efficiency, greenhouse gas standards are not related to fuel economy standards.|$|E

This thematic, all encompassing, eternal nature of reality and existence develops as the basis for Bhrigu's emphasis on introspection and inwardization, to help peel off the outer husks of knowledge, in order to reach and realize the innermost kernel of spiritual Self-knowledge.|$|E
