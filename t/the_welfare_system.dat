5|$|In 1996, after {{constructing}} two {{welfare reform}} bills that Clinton vetoed, Gingrich {{and his supporters}} pushed for passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which was intended to reconstruct <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>system.</b> The act gave state governments more autonomy over welfare delivery, while also reducing the federal government's responsibilities. It instituted the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which placed time limits on welfare assistance and replaced the longstanding Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Other changes to <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>system</b> included stricter conditions for food stamp eligibility, reductions in immigrant welfare assistance, and work requirements for recipients. The bill {{was signed into law}} by President Clinton on August 22, 1996.|$|E
5|$|A central {{pledge of}} President Bill Clinton's {{campaign}} was to reform <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>system,</b> adding {{changes such as}} work requirements for recipients. However, by 1994, the Clinton Administration appeared to be more concerned with pursuing a universal health care program. Gingrich accused Clinton of stalling on welfare, and proclaimed that Congress could pass a welfare reform bill {{in as little as}} 90 days. He insisted that the Republican Party would continue to apply political pressure to the President to approve their welfare legislation.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, Carmen Velazquez lost welfare {{benefits}} from the government under {{the provisions of the}} Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Act (TANF). An attorney from an LSC grantee, Bronx Legal Services, litigated her claim. Bronx Legal Services, on behalf of Velazquez, filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York seeking a declaration that the provision of the act prohibiting challenges to existing welfare law was unconstitutional under the First Amendment. It argued {{that there was no way}} to help Velazquez without challenging <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>system</b> itself, and sought to challenge the provisions of TANF under which Velazquez lost her benefits; a challenge they could not make due to the 1996 restrictions.

5|$|In January 2000, Baird {{unveiled}} {{a series of}} initiatives designed to reduce fraud and misuse in <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>system.</b> This was highlighted by {{the establishment of a}} welfare fraud hotline and a complementary conditionality three months later, in which anyone convicted of welfare fraud would run the risk of being given a lifetime ban from the program. The investigations Baird initiated during the fiscal year of 2000 uncovered $58.2 million in social assistance that people were not entitled to receive, and $16.6 million in avoided future costs, but critics of this approach, including opposition members, poverty advocates, and scholars, suggested that the Harris government was overstating the extent of fraud in order to undermine public confidence in welfare programs. In mid-year, Baird announced that workfare placements had reached departmental quotas for most of the province.|$|E

40|$|Introduction [...] . ] In this paper, {{we seek to}} {{identify}} innovative ways to limit inequality in households 2 ̆ 019 disposable incomes and living standards while keeping <b>welfare</b> <b>systems</b> fiscally sustainable. We focus on <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>systems</b> of EU countries in comparison, to better understand their key features. To set the scene, we review trends in income inequality in Europe {{in relation to other}} major world regions. We compare inequality before and after taxes and transfers across European countries to gain insights into the extent of redistribution and, hence, the impact of <b>the</b> national <b>welfare</b> <b>systems</b> (Section 2). Next we review the experience of five European countries that have been identified as examples of distinct <b>welfare</b> <b>system</b> models. We characterize national <b>welfare</b> <b>systems</b> in terms {{of the extent to which}} they decommodify labour, emphasize or relax stratification, and engage in social investment rather than income replacement during spells of unemployment (Section 3). We go on to assess the performance of our selected countries in terms of income redistribution, economic growth, polarization between rich and poor, and labour market developments (Section 4). We complement the picture by looking closely at evidence from surveys and economic experiments to assess inequality aversion in our selected countries and relate our findings to the extent of redistribution and other features of <b>the</b> national <b>welfare</b> <b>systems</b> (Section 5). We look for recent challenges for and responses by <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>systems</b> and reflect on adjustment requirements that lie ahead (Section 6). The final section concludes (Section 7).

In this paper, {{the author}} {{deals with the}} effects of <b>the</b> social <b>welfare</b> <b>system</b> on <b>the</b> {{unemployed}} in the Republic of Croatia. Since a large number of the unemployed have no means for living and for the support of their families, a large number of them rely on different forms of assistance from <b>the</b> social <b>welfare</b> <b>system.</b> <b>The</b> changes in <b>the</b> Croatian social <b>welfare</b> <b>system</b> in <b>the</b> last few years have to a large extent been influenced by the increased problem of unemployment.

25|$|In general, the {{influence}} of German trade unions has declined since 1990 and had to accept shrinking real incomes and a reform of <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>system</b> in 2004 ("Hartz IV laws"), which put additional pressure on wages. For some years, the DGB and its member unions have been campaigning for a minimum wage to be introduced in Germany. Well into the 1990s, they had rejected this idea because they got better results from their strong position in the German system of collective bargaining.|$|E

When the international economic outlook improved combined with a rapid growth in the IT sector, which Sweden was well positioned to capitalize on, the country was able {{to emerge from the}} crisis.|$|E

25|$|Caspar Voght (November 17, 1752 in Hamburg – March 20, 1839 in Hamburg), later Caspar Reichsfreiherr von Voght (more {{commonly}} known as Baron Caspar von Voght), was a German merchant and social reformer from Hamburg (today Germany).

On numerous trade trips, he completely crossed the European continent. One of his greatest achievements was reforming <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>system</b> of Hamburg.

The Ruhr region was hardest hit, as its easy-to-reach coal mines petered out, and expensive German coal was no longer competitive. Likewise the Ruhr steel industry went into sharp decline, as its prices were undercut by lower-cost suppliers such as Japan. <b>The</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>system</b> provided a safety net for {{the large number of}} unemployed workers, and many factories reduce their labor force and began to concentrate on high-profit specialty items.

25|$|Felipe González's {{second term}} as Prime Minister was {{characterized}} by economic growth, with public investments favoured by the Structural Funds coming from the European Economic Community to which Spain had recently accessed. The GDP grew by around or above 5% between 1987 and 1989 and unemployment decreased from 20.6% to 16.9%. This period also saw the consolidation of <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>system</b> reforms initiated during González's first term, allowed through a better financing derived from a relatively progressive tax system. However, the economic expansion fostered by the government's liberal policies also brought about an increase in wealth differences and of inequality, leading to social unrest {{and a loss of}} popularity for the ruling PSOE which was made apparent in the 1987 local, regional and European Parliament elections. By the end of 1988, the two major trade unions in Spain, CCOO and UGT, had called a general strike which succeeded in paralyzing the country and in forcing the González's government to negotiate a partial withdrawal of its economic policies.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the criticisms {{levelled}} against the Hawke Government, it succeeded in enacting {{a wide range of}} social reforms during its time in office. Deflecting arguments that the Hawke Government had failed as a reform government, Neville Wran, John Dawkins, Bill Hayden and Paul Keating made a number of speeches throughout the 1980s arguing that the Hawke Government had been a recognisably reformist government, drawing attention to Hawke's achievements as Prime Minister during his first five years in office. As well as the reintroduction of Medibank, under the new name Medicare, these included the doubling of the number of childcare places, the introduction of occupational superannuation, a boost in school retention rates, a focus on young people's job skills, a doubling of subsidised homecare services, the elimination of poverty traps in <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>system,</b> a 50% increase in public housing funds, an increase in the real value of the old-age pension, {{the development of a new}} youth support program, the reintroduction of six-monthly indexation of single-person unemployment benefits, and significant improvements in social security provisions. As pointed out by John Dawkins, the proportion of total government outlays allocated to families, the sick, single parents, widows, the handicapped, and veterans was significantly higher under the Hawke Government than under the Whitlam Government. In 1989, the Hawke Labor Government gradually re-introducing fees for university study. It set up the Higher Education Contributions Scheme (HECS), which was first proposed by Professor Murray Wells and subsequently developed by economist and lecturer at the Australian National University, Bruce Chapman and championed by Education Minister John Dawkins (see Dawkins Revolution). Under the original HECS, a $1,800 fee was charged to all university students, and the Commonwealth paid the balance. A student could defer payment of this HECS amount (in which case it was called a HECS debt) and repay the debt through the tax system, when the student's income exceeds a threshold level. As part of the reforms, Colleges of Advanced Education entered the University sector by various means. The HECS system was accepted by both federal political parties and has survived until today, though with a number of changes.|$|E
