5|$|Anyone {{attempting}} {{to cross the}} control strips would leave footprints, which were quickly detected by patrols. This enabled the guards to identify otherwise undetected escape attempts, recording how many individuals had crossed, where escape attempts were being made and at which <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> escapees were active. From this information, the guards were able to determine where and when patrols needed to be increased, where improved surveillance from watchtowers and bunkers was required, and which areas needed additional fortifications.|$|E
5|$|However, {{without the}} ability to {{effectively}} track weak laser signals, collection of atmospheric data would be relegated to <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> where the sun's electromagnetic emissions did not drown out the laser's signal. The addition of an atomic line filter to the LIDAR equipment effectively filters interference to the laser's signal {{to the point where}} LIDAR data can be collected at any time of the day. For the past decade, Faraday filters have been used to do this. Consequently, scientists know significantly more today about the Earth's middle atmosphere than they did before the advent of the FADOF.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{effects of}} light only {{last for a}} few minutes, thus the canvases documenting such ephemera {{received}} attention {{for no more than}} a few minutes a day. Further complicating matters, the light of subsequent sunrises, for example, could alter substantially and would require separate canvases within the series. Subsequently, different hues are evident in each painting, and in each work, color is used to describe not only direct but reflected light. At differing <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> and in various seasons stacks absorb the light from diverse parts of the color spectrum. As a result, the residual light that is reflected off of the stacks is seen as ever-changing, and manifests in distinctive coloring.|$|E
40|$|Subjective age, or how old one feels, is {{associated}} with one?s mental and physical well-being. Recent research suggests that subjective age may be malleable and can be affected by contextual variables. This proposed study aims to determine if subjective age is affected by <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day.</b> Research shows that the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> (the morning vs. afternoon) influences people?s ability to perform cognitive tasks and alters their attitudes and judgments. We hypothesize that <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> may also influence how old people feel- their subjective age. If results show that subjective age is affected by <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day,</b> then this will demonstrate the subjective age is malleable, and that people?s self-perceptions can change throughout the day...|$|R
40|$|An {{essential}} element of demand modeling {{in the airline industry}} is the representation <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> demand [...] the demand for a given itinerary as a function of its departure or arrival times. It is an important datum that drives successful scheduling and fleet decisions. There are two key components to this problem: the distribution <b>of</b> the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> demand and how preferred travel time influences itinerary choice. This paper focuses on estimating the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> distribution. Our objective is to estimate it {{in a manner that is}} not confounded with air travel supply; is a function of the characteristics of the traveler, the trip, and the market; and accounts for potential measurement errors in self-reported travel time preferences. We employ a stated preference dataset collected by intercepting people who were booking continental US trips via an internet booking service. Respondents reported preferred travel times as well as choices from a hypothetical set of itineraries. We parameterize the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> distribution as a mixture of normal distributions (due to the strong peaking nature <b>of</b> travel <b>time</b> preferences) and allow the mixing function to vary by individual characteristics and trip attributes. We estimate the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> distribution and the itinerary choice model jointly in a manner that accounts for measurement error in the self-reported travel time preferences. We find that the mixture of normal distributions fits the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> distribution well and is behaviorally intuitive. The strongest covariates <b>of</b> travel <b>time</b> preferences are party size and time zone change. The methodology employed to treat self-reported travel time preferences as potentially having error contributes to the broader transportation <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> demand literature, which either assumes that the desired travel times are known with certainty or that they are unknown. We find that the error in self-reported travel time preferences is statistically significant and impacts the inferred <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> demand distribution.

5|$|Kerala cuisine has a {{multitude}} of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes prepared using fish, poultry, and meat. Culinary spices have been cultivated in Kerala for millennia and they are characteristic of its cuisine. Rice is a dominant staple that is eaten at all <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>day.</b> A majority of the breakfast foods in Kerala are made out of rice, {{in one form or}} the other (idli, puttu, appam, or idiyappam), tapioca preparations, or pulse-based vada. These may be accompanied by chutney, kadala, payasam, payar pappadam, appam, chicken curry, beef fry, egg masala and fish curry. Lunch dishes include rice and curry along with rasam, pulisherry and sambar. Sadhya is a vegetarian meal, which is served on a banana leaf and followed with a cup of payasam. Popular snacks include banana chips, yam crisps, tapioca chips, unniyappam and kuzhalappam. Seafood specialties include karimeen, prawns, shrimp and other crustacean dishes.|$|E
5|$|Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow {{looked for}} effects with {{significant}} years. They asked 83 undergraduate students to rate, {{on a scale}} from 1 to 7, how much they liked the years between 1976 and 2001, the months of the year, the seasons, <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>day,</b> and even types of pet in an attempt to disguise the aim of the study. Analysis of the data showed that participants liked the year of their birth much more than the average of the four years after they were born. The researchers also found that the year of high school graduation was also liked better than average. Of the months of the year, the most liked month was the one in which the participants were born.|$|E
5|$|Set {{apart from}} the glowing underside, the darker, nonluminescent collar tapers at {{both sides of the}} throat, and has been {{hypothesized}} to serve as a lure by mimicking the silhouette of a small fish from below. The appeal of the lure would be multiplied in a school of sharks. If the collar does function in this way, the cookiecutter shark would be the only known case of bioluminescence in which the absence of light attracts prey, while its photophores serve to prevent premature detection by incoming would-be predators. As the shark can only match a limited range of light intensities, its vertical movements likely serve to preserve the effectiveness of its disguise across various <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> and weather conditions.|$|E

5|$|Several {{sets were}} {{rendered}} digitally, {{and almost all}} of the sets had some form of digital enhancement. The largest digital environment was the Devetashka cave, which had to be digitally recreated because of the environmental concerns of filming explosions in the real cave. Using over 5,000 photographs taken at different <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>day,</b> the cave was accurately illuminated and rendered down to crevices and moss. The cave's interior containing a concealed nuclear vault was subjected to several changes up to two months before the effects' delivery date based on editorial input, including modifications to its scale. The railcar used within the cave was also digitally built alongside a practical version, but the digital versions versatility saw it largely replace its practical counterpart. The scene featuring the Expendables and prisoners trapped in the cave were shot entirely on Chroma key with the cave background inserted later.|$|E
5|$|The {{engravings}} are mirror {{images of}} the paintings (since the engraved plates are copied from the paintings the image is reversed when printed), which leads to problems ascertaining the times shown on the clocks {{in some of the}} scenes. The images are sometimes seen as parodies of middle class life in London at the time, but the moral judgements are not as harsh as in some of Hogarth's other works and the lower classes do not escape ridicule either. Often the theme is one of over-orderliness versus chaos. The four plates depict four <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>day,</b> but they also move through the seasons: Morning is set in winter, Noon in spring, and Evening in summer. However, Night—sometimes misidentified as being in September—takes place on Oak Apple Day in May rather than in the autumn.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{other animal}} stories that uses words humans use, the feline {{characters}} of the Warriors series use different words for certain concepts and objects in the natural world.

The cats also have their own terms for time and measurement, such as sundown or moonhigh representing different <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> according to {{the positions of the}} moon, sun, and stars overhead. The seasons are given names according to the trees and foliage in the forest, with 'newleaf' meaning spring, 'greenleaf' meaning summer, 'leaf-fall' meaning autumn, and 'leaf-bare' meaning winter.|$|E

5|$|BS Fire Emblem: Archanea Senki-hen, {{commonly}} referred to as BS Fire Emblem, is an episodic tactical role-playing game developed by Intelligent Systems and released in 1997 following the release of Genealogy of the Holy War. It acts as a prequel to the events of the first Fire Emblem title and Mystery of the Emblem. The four episodes of BS Fire Emblem were broadcast between September and October 1997 on the Satellaview peripheral service, a system where short games were downloaded via satellite at given <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>day.</b> While it employs the same tactical gameplay as the mainline titles, it throws waves of enemies at the main party during a three-hour time limit. BS Fire Emblem was directed and designed by Kaga, while the music was composed by Tsujiyoko in her role as composer and sound director. The character artwork was done by Rika Suzuki, a newcomer to the Fire Emblem series who would later go on to create character illustrations for Fire Emblem Awakening. It was the first title in the Fire Emblem series to include voice acting, created using livestreaming during the original broadcast. The game used the technology created for Mystery of the Emblem.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{sound and}} music were handled by Takahiro Ogata, Masaki Kurokawa and Kenichi Tsuchiya: Ogata acted as sound director. To {{accurately}} create {{the sound of}} modern-day Tokyo within Nine, Ogata and Kurokawa went to districts such as Kichijōji and Roppongi to make recordings of ambient sounds at different <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>day.</b> While {{there was a general}} theme for various city districts, the music subtly changed depending on the player's overall alignment: for instance, to represent the Law and Chaos alignments in the game, piano was used for the former and guitar for the latter. Battle music also featured randomly-generated soundtrack variations, with Ogata estimating somewhere over three hundred possible variants on battle themes. A major improvement enabled by the Xbox was the use of 5.1 surround sound, which could enable richer use of both music and in-game sound effects. According to Okada, this additional sound capacity would compensate for what could not be managed at a visual level. Maken X had already given the team a chance to use 3D sound, but Nine was the first title to make major use of 5.1, and implementing it alongside all the other features proved a challenge for the team.|$|E
