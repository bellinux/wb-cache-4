5|$|Mumbai has a {{tropical}} climate, specifically a <b>tropical</b> <b>wet</b> and dry climate (Aw) under the Köppen climate classification, with {{seven months of}} dryness and peak of rains in July. The cooler season from December to February {{is followed by the}} summer season from March to June. The period from June to about the end of September constitutes the south-west monsoon season, and October and November form the post-monsoon season.|$|E
5|$|The Caelifera {{includes}} some 2,400 valid genera and about 11,000 known species. Many undescribed species probably exist, especially in <b>tropical</b> <b>wet</b> forests. The Caelifera have a predominantly tropical distribution with fewer species known from temperate zones, {{but most of}} the superfamilies have representatives worldwide. They are almost exclusively herbivorous and are probably the oldest living group of chewing herbivorous insects.|$|E
5|$|The Indian {{climate is}} {{strongly}} influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping {{the bulk of the}} Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: <b>tropical</b> <b>wet,</b> tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{biodiversity}} is concentrated and protected in the Western Ghats. Three {{quarters of the}} land area of Kerala was under thick forest up to 18th century. , over 25% of India's 15,000 plant species are in Kerala. Out of the 4,000 flowering plant species; 1,272 of which are endemic to Kerala, 900 are medicinal, and 159 are threatened. Its 9,400km2 of forests include <b>tropical</b> <b>wet</b> evergreen and semi-evergreen forests (lower and middle elevations—3,470km2), tropical moist and dry deciduous forests (mid-elevations—4,100km2 and 100km2, respectively), and montane subtropical and temperate (shola) forests (highest elevations—100km2). Altogether, 24% of Kerala is forested. Three of the world's Ramsar Convention listed wetlands—Lake Sasthamkotta, Ashtamudi Lake and the Vembanad-Kol wetlands—are in Kerala, as well as 1455.4km2 of the vast Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. Subjected to extensive clearing for cultivation in the 20th century, much of the remaining forest cover is now protected from clearfelling. Eastern Kerala's windward mountains shelter tropical moist forests and tropical dry forests, which are common in the Western Ghats. The world's oldest teak plantation 'Conolly's Plot' is in Nilambur.|$|E

25|$|Saltwater {{crocodiles}} generally {{spend the}} <b>tropical</b> <b>wet</b> season in freshwater swamps and rivers, moving downstream to estuaries {{in the dry}} season, and sometimes travelling far out to sea. Crocodiles compete fiercely {{with each other for}} territory, with dominant males in particular occupying the most eligible stretches of freshwater creeks and streams. Junior crocodiles are thus forced into the more marginal river systems and sometimes into the ocean. This explains the large distribution of the animal (ranging from the east coast of India to northern Australia), as well as its being found in the odd places on occasion (such as the Sea of Japan). Like all crocodiles, they can survive for prolonged periods in only warm temperatures, and crocodiles seasonally vacate parts of Australia if cold spells hit.|$|E
