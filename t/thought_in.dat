5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have argued that}} Buddhaghosa's writing evinces a strong but unacknowledged Yogācāra Buddhist influence, which subsequently came to characterize Theravada <b>thought</b> <b>in</b> {{the wake of his}} profound influence on the Theravada tradition.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the witches}} do not {{deliberately}} tell Macbeth to kill King Duncan, {{they use a}} subtle form of temptation when they inform Macbeth that he is destined to be king. By placing this <b>thought</b> <b>in</b> his mind, they effectively guide him {{on the path to}} his own destruction. This follows the pattern of temptation attributed to the Devil in the contemporary imagination: the Devil was believed to be a <b>thought</b> <b>in</b> a person's mind, which he or she might either indulge or reject. Macbeth indulges the temptation, while Banquo rejects it.|$|E

5|$|Al-Maʿarri was an ascetic, renouncing worldly {{desires and}} living secluded from others while {{producing}} his works. He opposed {{all forms of}} violence.

5|$|His {{influence}} can {{as well be}} seen in Ecuadorian <b>thought</b> <b>in</b> general, as {{his work}} {{has been one of}} its principal influences; Ecuadorian education, as he promoted new pedagogical ideas, such as the creation of good citizens instead of merely imparting knowledge, and finally Ecuadorian science, as he was, along with Pedro Vicente Maldonado, one of the two most important scientists of colonial Ecuador. Espejo analyzed the reality of colonial Quito, the poverty of its people and their lack of good education, and he denounced the corruption of the colonial authorities.|$|E
5|$|Several {{periods of}} Protestant Christian revival nurtured a {{proliferation}} of new religious movements in the United States. In {{the latter half of}} the 19th century these included what came to be known as the metaphysical family: groups such as Christian Science, Divine Science, the Unity School of Christianity and (later) the United Church of Religious Science. From the 1890s the liberal section of the movement became known as New <b>Thought,</b> <b>in</b> part to distinguish it from the more authoritarian Christian Science.|$|E

5|$|When the live-action of the manga was made, Watsuki {{had several}} ideas about Kenshin's mind about his early {{appearances}} in the series.

Although there were some changes to the cast, Watsuki {{wanted them to be}} subtle such as Kenshin wearing a scarf. He also wrote a prequel chapter to the original series which helped the readers to understand why Kenshin would stay in Kaoru's dojo.|$|E
