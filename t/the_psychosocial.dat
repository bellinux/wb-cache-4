However, adolescents with cleft palate/lip are at an elevated risk for developing psychosocial problems especially those relating to self-concept, peer relationships and appearance. Adolescents may face psychosocial challenges but can find professional help if problems arise. A cleft palate/lip may impact an individual’s self-esteem, social skills and behavior. There is research dedicated to <b>the</b> <b>psychosocial</b> development of individuals with cleft palate.

25|$|Studies {{show that}} there is a direct {{correlation}} between poverty and mental illness. The lower the socioeconomic status of an individual the higher the risk of mental illness.

This increased risk for psychiatric complications remains consistent for all individuals among the impoverished population, regardless of any in-group demographic differences that they may possess.

Using a non-experimental design, this study explored the influence of underrepresented students’ psychosocial behavior on their persistence. The study surveyed a population of 2, 993 incoming first-year students. Two hundred seventy-seven students responded to the 62 -item survey, and 204 met the underrepresented-student criteria.
