5|$|As a {{response}} to the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, Venizelos's power base was further strengthened, and on 8 October 1908 the Cretan Assembly passed a resolution in favor of union despite both the reservations of the Athens government under Georgios Theotokis and <b>the</b> <b>objections</b> <b>of</b> the Great Powers. The muted reaction of the Athens Government to the news from Crete led to an unsettled state of affairs on the mainland.|$|E

5|$|Much of what {{is known}} of Euler's {{religious}} beliefs can be deduced from his Letters to a German Princess and an earlier work, Rettung der Göttlichen Offenbahrung Gegen die Einwürfe der Freygeister (Defense of the Divine Revelation against <b>the</b> <b>Objections</b> <b>of</b> the Freethinkers). These works show that Euler was a devout Christian who believed the Bible to be inspired; the Rettung was primarily an argument for the divine inspiration of scripture.|$|E
5|$|Ongoing {{negotiations}} through March yielded {{an agreement}} on March 7, 1999, over <b>the</b> <b>objections</b> <b>of</b> the State Department.

5|$|Goebbels' efforts {{had little}} impact {{for the time}} being, as while Hitler was in {{principle}} in favour of total war, he {{was not prepared to}} implement changes over <b>the</b> <b>objections</b> <b>of</b> his ministers. The discovery around this time of a mass grave of Polish officers that had been killed by the Red Army in the 1940 Katyn massacre was made use of by Goebbels in his propaganda in an attempt to drive a wedge between the Soviets and the other western allies.|$|E

I’m trying {{to demonstrate that}} these objections are not conclusive as refutation or rejection of metalinguistic theory. I argue {{that this is a}} not a theory of reference but rather of the meaning or semantic value of proper names. Thus, the semantic value of a proper name “N” is “The bearer of ‘N’. ” In this approach the significance of this proper name unifies all the possibilities for its referential use and allow us to defend that the name itself is an expression of language, despite arguments to the contrary...|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{prior to the}} {{construction}} of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, the Fairbanks economy was unsteady. The News-Miner planned to expand its printing plant, but many in the company were unsure if the economy could support the added capacity. Over <b>the</b> <b>objections</b> <b>of</b> the News-Miner newsroom, Snedden decided to expand the Aurora Building by adding a second floor at a cost of $2 million. In 1974, as construction of the pipeline got under way, demand for office space in Fairbanks was so great that Alyeska Pipeline Company rented several News-Miner offices in the newly expanded building. About this time, the News-Miner replaced its Associated Press teletypes with a satellite connection.|$|E
5|$|Left {{with little}} {{recourse}} {{now that his}} German troops were gone, King Otto gave in to the pressure and agreed {{to the demands of}} the crowd over <b>the</b> <b>objections</b> <b>of</b> his opinionated Queen. This square was renamed Constitution Square (Πλατεία Συντάγματος) to commemorate (through to the present) the events of September 1843—and to feature many later tumultuous events of Greek history. Now for the first time, the king had Greeks in his Council and the French Party, the English Party and the Russian Party (according to which of the Great Powers' culture they most esteemed) vied for rank and power.|$|E

The company spent several weeks in division reserve, and undertook various missions such as convoy security and guarding command posts, {{as well as}} surveillance and visiting patrols behind the front lines. In one of these rearguard actions, the Rangers evacuated a rundown village only to have {{one member of the}} unit, Corporal Dave Rauls, captured by three Chinese infiltrators.|$|E
50|$|It was {{generally}} believed Spee was misled by the German admiralty into attacking the Falklands, a Royal Naval fuelling base, after receiving intelligence from the German wireless station at Valparaiso which reported the port free of Royal Navy warships.

Kasa-Vubu was proclaimed President, and Lumumba Prime Minister, of the Republic of the Congo. Despite <b>the</b> <b>objections</b> <b>of</b> CONAKAT and others, the constitution was largely centralist, concentrating power in the central government in Léopoldville, and did not devolve significant powers to provincial level.|$|E
5|$|The Jews of the Papal States, {{numbering}} 15,000 {{or so in}} 1858, were {{grateful to}} Pope Pius IX because he had ended the long-standing legal obligation for them to attend sermons in church four times a year, based on that week's Torah portion and aimed at their conversion to Christianity. He had also torn down {{the gates of the}} Roman Ghetto despite <b>the</b> <b>objections</b> <b>of</b> many Christians.
