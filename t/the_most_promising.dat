5|$|In 1918, Chapman scored 472 runs at 52.44 {{and took}} 15 wickets; the {{following}} year, he captained the team, scored 637 runs {{at an average}} of 70.77 and took 40 wickets. As a consequence of his achievements, he was chosen as one of the Cricketers of the Year for 1919 in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. In both 1918 and 1919 he was selected for prestigious school representative matches at Lord's Cricket Ground; although his weak defensive play drew comment, he was regarded as one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>promising</b> cricketers of his generation when he left Uppingham in 1919.|$|E
5|$|On March 26, 2001, Heisley {{announced}} that he had selected Memphis. Memphis and Louisville were <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>promising</b> cities, with Heisley selecting Memphis because it offered a better deal and because of poor local executive leadership in Louisville. The choice would still have to be studied by a five-member NBA group before permission was granted from the league. The team's final game at GM Place was a 95–100 loss against the Houston Rockets on April 14; the team's final game as a Vancouver-based franchise was a road 95–81 win against the Golden State Warriors on April 18.|$|E

5|$|The POSTERN {{plan called}} for the 7th Division to move in {{transports}} to Port Moresby and in coastal shipping {{to the mouth of}} the Lakekamu River. It would travel up the river in barges to Bulldog, and in trucks over the Bulldog Road to Wau and Bulolo. From there it would march overland via the Watut and Wampit Valleys to the Markham River, cross the Markham River with the aid of paratroops, and secure an airfield site. There were a number of suitable airfield sites in the Markham Valley; Blamey selected Nadzab as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>promising.</b>|$|E
5|$|The diet of bigfin reef squids {{comprises}} mainly crustaceans {{and small}} fish. They {{are found in}} the temperate and tropical waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and have recently been introduced into the Mediterranean as a Lessepsian migrant. They are commonly found near the shoreline, near rocks, and coral reefs. They are fished in vast quantities for human food in Asia. Because of their rapid growth rate, short life span, and tolerance to handling and captivity, bigfin reef squids are regarded as one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>promising</b> species for mariculture. They are also a valuable source of giant axons for medical research.|$|E
5|$|The {{first test}} would {{probably}} be a ground burst, but consideration was also given to an explosion in a ship to measure the effect of a ship-borne atomic bomb on a major port. Such data would complement that obtained about an underwater explosion by the American Operation Crossroads nuclear test in 1946, and would therefore be of value to the Americans. Seven Canadian sites were assessed, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>promising</b> being Churchill, Manitoba, but the waters were too shallow to allow ships to approach close to shore.|$|E

5|$|After {{beginning}} {{his career with}} Manchester United in 2011, Pogba joined Italian side Juventus in 2012, and helped the club to four consecutive Serie A titles, {{as well as two}} Coppa Italia and two Supercoppa Italiana titles. During his time with the club, he established himself as one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>promising</b> young players in the world, and received the Golden Boy award in 2013, followed by the Bravo Award in 2014 and was named by The Guardian as one of the ten most promising young players in Europe. In 2016, Pogba was named to the 2015 UEFA Team of the Year as well as the 2015 FIFA FIFPro World XI, after helping Juventus to the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final. Despite leaving Manchester United on a free transfer, Pogba returned to the club in 2016 for a then-world record transfer fee of €105million (£89.3million).|$|E
5|$|Because the {{cross-sections}} {{of these}} fusion-evaporation reactions increase with the asymmetry of the reaction, titanium {{would be a}} better projectile than chromium for the synthesis of element 121. This necessitates an einsteinium target, since titanium has 22 protons and the remaining 99 must be supplied by the target, and einsteinium is element 99. This poses severe challenges due to the significant heating and damage of the target due to the high radioactivity of einsteinium-254, but it would probably be <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>promising</b> approach to element 119 with 48Ca beams and possibly element 121 with 50Ti beams. It would also require working on a smaller scale due to the lower amount of 254Es that can be produced. This small-scale work could in the near future only be carried out in Dubna's SHE-factory.|$|E
5|$|Bickford {{was born}} in Kentucky but raised in West Virginia. He began his {{professional}} career in 1939 and, after serving in World War II, made the majors in 1949. Acquired by the Braves organization due to a flip of a coin, Bickford became one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>promising</b> National League pitchers during his playing career, earning All-Star honors in 1949 and leading the National League in complete games in 1950. However his career was soon shorted by multiple arm injuries, and {{he was out of}} baseball by 1955. After working an assortment of jobs, he was diagnosed with stomach cancer in 1960 and died after a three-month illness.|$|E

5|$|Charlotte Johnson taught {{part-time}} at the Nottingham School of Art, {{and managed}} to have Knight enrolled as an 'artisan student' there, paying no fees, aged just 13. At the age of fifteen, and still a student herself, Knight took over her mother's teaching duties when Charlotte {{was diagnosed with cancer}} and became seriously ill. Later Knight won a scholarship and the gold medal in the national student competition held by the then South Kensington Museum. She continued to give private lessons after she left the School of Art, as both she and her sister Evangeline Agnes, known as Sissie, had been left to live alone on very little money, after the deaths of their mother, their sister Nellie and both their grandmothers. At the School of Art, Laura met one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>promising</b> students, Harold Knight, then aged 17, and determined that the best method of learning was to copy Harold's technique. They became friends, and married in 1903.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the poor}} quality of most studies of {{complementary}} and alternative medicine {{in the treatment of}} cancer pain, {{it is not possible to}} recommend integration of these therapies into the management of cancer pain. There is weak evidence for a modest benefit from hypnosis; studies of massage therapy produced mixed results and none found pain relief after 4 weeks; Reiki, and touch therapy results were inconclusive; acupuncture, the most studied such treatment, has demonstrated no benefit as an adjunct analgesic in cancer pain; the evidence for music therapy is equivocal; and some herbal interventions such as PC-SPES, mistletoe, and saw palmetto are known to be toxic to some people with cancer. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>promising</b> evidence, though still weak, is for mind-body interventions such as biofeedback and relaxation techniques.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of Cromwell's rule and the {{subsequent}} Restoration, Smith manoeuvred to protect his position and to further his essentially Puritan religious stance, which he modified to suit the religious sensibilities of the new Royalist regime. He achieved this in part by creating an eponymous trust whereby some of his Irish property {{was used for the}} purpose of financing the education of children and provided scholarships for <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>promising</b> of those to continue their studies at Trinity College, Dublin. However, there have been claims that this trust was intended primarily to protect his interests in land, of which some was obtained by dubious interpretation of law.|$|E

Hedren quits working for Hitchcock after completing Marnie, but he refuses to release her from her contract; this prevents her from working for another production company, effectively ending her Hollywood career. Two notes before the titles inform the viewer that Hitchcock and Hedren never worked together again, and The Birds and Marnie are considered his last classic films.|$|E
5|$|Jordan's well {{developed}} industrial sector, which includes mining, manufacturing, construction, and power, accounted for approximately 26% of the GDP in 2004 (including manufacturing, 16.2%; construction, 4.6%; and mining, 3.1%). More than 21% of Jordan's labor force was employed in industry in 2002. In 2014, industry accounted for 6% of the GDP. The main industrial products are potash, phosphates, cement, clothes, and fertilisers. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>promising</b> segment of this sector is construction. Petra Engineering Industries Company, {{which is considered}} {{to be one of the}} main pillars of Jordanian industry, has gained international recognition with its air-conditioning units reaching NASA.

5|$|M87 is a {{very strong}} source of gamma rays, which are the most {{energetic}} rays of the electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma rays coming from M87 have been observed since the late 1990s, but in 2006, using the High Energy Stereoscopic System Cherenkov telescopes, scientists have measured the variations of the gamma ray flux coming from M87, and found that the flux changes over a matter of days. This short period makes the immediate vicinity of the supermassive black hole in M87 <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>promising</b> source for these gamma rays. In general, the smaller the diameter of the emission source, the faster the variation in flux, and vice versa.|$|E
