6000|$|... "I am English," [...] Ned said at once. [...] "I {{think you}} are kind by your face, and I tell you <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> <b>There</b> <b>are</b> two English girls in the wood, and one is ill. We can go no further. Will you give them shelter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Girl--girl," [...] {{interrupted}} the father, [...] "quiet that glib tongue of thine, and hear <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> <b>There</b> <b>are</b> savages {{on the lake}} shore already, and no man can say how near to us they may be at this very moment, or when we may hear more from them!" ...|$|E
60|$|To say <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a {{suspicious}} {{kind of a}} grunt in their voices, {{and for a long}} time afterwards they spoke gruffly, and were apt to set up a squeal.|$|R
6000|$|... "No one," [...] he answered. [...] "To {{tell you}} <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{no one to}} ask within a dozen miles, and you {{particularly}} {{asked not to be}} bothered with meeting yokels." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Apologise! <b>There</b> can <b>be</b> no apologising {{between you}} and me. If I can make each of you {{understand}} <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> not I think any doubt but {{that you will be}} brought together." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{lifted the}} latch {{and opened the}} door. It gave access at once to the single plain living-room. There, all was huddled. For a moment my eyes hardly took in <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> <b>There</b> <b>are</b> sights so sickening that the brain at the first shock wholly fails to realise them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{very glad}} {{to hear you say}} so, Miss Delora," [...] I answered. [...] "To tell you <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some men here at present who are asking me questions. I have told them, however, that you are the only person to whom they should apply." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{no need of}} bawling it aloud, as if thou wert hailing a Sicilian through thy trumpet, {{though the}} fact should be so. To say <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> few men in {{business}} who {{are thought to have}} more custom than he who has just gone up the piazzetta." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just so, Mr. Fitzgerald; just so. I {{know you}} will feel that--in such matters we can only sail safely by <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> no other compass worth a man's while to look at." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am telling}} his lordship <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> some {{reason why you}} should not take the money, and you won't take it. I think it very hard that I {{should not have been}} allowed to earn it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What an observant {{person you}} are! To tell you <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> just one guest whom I was {{particularly}} {{anxious to see}} here to-night. He promised to come, but so far I am afraid {{that he has not}} arrived." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps I {{am not so}} {{absolutely}} courageous as you think," [...] she remarked. [...] "To {{tell you}} <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> a good many things of which I am afraid {{when you come to}} me in such a state. I am afraid of you, of what you will do or say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You must please excuse me, Speedwell," [...] he said. [...] "It's {{very kind}} of you, but to tell you <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> certain painful {{incidents}} in connection with my life before I came to London which I am anxious to forget. I do not choose to have a past at all." ...|$|E
60|$|TALK. To talk {{of things}} that are good, to me is very acceptable, with you or with any other; and I am glad that I have met with those that incline to so good a work; for, to speak <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> but few who care thus to spend their time as they are in their travels, but choose much rather to be {{speaking}} of things to no profit; and this has been a trouble to me.|$|E
5000|$|... "We {{should not}} be ashamed to {{acknowledge}} truth from whatever source it comes to us, {{even if it is}} brought to us by former generations and foreign peoples. For him who seeks <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> nothing of higher value than truth itself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{prisoner}} {{can remain}} here, {{or in your}} custody, until the party returns. If the boy has told <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> nothing {{for me to do}} but discharge him, and I am really glad that he has come out so fortunately." ...|$|R
5000|$|Years later, one non-Mormon {{neighbor}} {{summed up}} views of Smith {{and his family}} by their Palmyra neighbors by saying, [...] "To tell <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> something about him they could not understand; some way he knew more than they did, and it made them mad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Monsieur," [...] said he, [...] "there {{are many}} times {{when it is not}} wise or politic to tell <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> <b>There</b> <b>are</b> many times, therefore, when I have to speak falsehoods, but I will confess that I do not like it. Always I would prefer the truth, if it were possible. When I saw you at the Opera in Paris I thought of you only as one of my best and most valued patrons. It was only as we stood there talking that another idea came into my head. I acted upon it. There was a reason why I took you to the Cafe des Deux Epingles!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I {{fear they}} may {{if we do}} not attack," [...] replied Jacob. [...] "Moreover, Lady, to tell <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> other things to be thought of. For instance, the King's cause and honour, which we are bound to forward, and the lives and goods of all those who through us have {{declared}} themselves for him. If we lie idle Abbot Maldon will send messengers to the north and within a few days bring down thousands upon us, against whom we cannot hope to stand. Indeed, it is probable that he has already sent. But if they hear that the Abbey has fallen the rebels will scarcely come for revenge alone. Lastly, if we sit with folded hands, our own people may grow cold with doubts and fears and melt away, who now are hot as fire." ...|$|E
60|$|This play, {{like that}} which preceded it, is a drama of intrigue, {{borrowed}} from the Spanish, and claiming merit only {{in proportion to the}} diversity and ingenuity of the incidents represented. On this point every reader can decide for himself; and it would be an invidious task to point out blemishes, where, to own <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> but few beauties. The ease with which the affections of almost every female in the drama are engrossed by Gonsalvo, and afterwards transferred to the lovers, upon whom the winding up of the plot made it necessary to devolve them, will, it is probable, strike every reader as unnatural. In truth, when the depraved appetite of the public requires to be gratified by trick and bustle, instead of nature and sentiment, authors must sacrifice the probable, as well as the simple, process of events.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps it is, perhaps not. To own <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{not much}} {{law on the}} coast, and the strong arm often does {{as much as the}} right. Our owners, therefore, I believe, think it quite as well <b>there</b> should <b>be</b> no lack of guns and {{ammunition}} on board." ...|$|R
60|$|Although Hardy Baker was not {{noted for}} strict loyalty to <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no one among the party who doubted his statement, and {{immediately}} the question arose {{as to what}} should be done to bring the offending shopkeeper to a full realisation of the enormity of his offence.|$|R
60|$|She {{wiped her}} eyes with {{the corner of her}} apron, dropped me a curtsey, and withdrew. Feurgéres came in presently, and I avoided looking at him for the first few minutes. To tell <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a lump in my own throat. When he spoke, however, his tone was as usual.|$|R
60|$|I said Protestant--I say it again. What is the watchword of Protestantism? It is this. That no lie is of <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> <b>There</b> <b>are</b> {{those who}} {{complain}} of us English that we attach {{too high a}} value to TRUTH. They say that falsehood is an evil: but not so great a one as we fancy. We accept the imputation. We answer boldly {{that there can be}} no greater evil than falsehood, no greater blessing than truth; and that by God's help we will teach the same to our children, and to our children's children. Free inquiry, religious as well as civil liberty--this is the spirit of Protestantism. This our fathers have bequeathed to us; this we will bequeath to our children;--to know that all truth is of God, that no lie is of the truth. Our enemies may call us heretics, unbelievers, rebellious, political squabblers. They may say in scorn, You Protestants know not whither you are going; you have broken yourselves off from the old Catholic tree, and now, in the wild exercise of your own private judgment, you are losing all that standard of doctrine, all unity of belief. Our answer will be--It is not so: but even if it were so-- even if we did not know whither we were going--we should go forward still. For though we know not, God knows. We have committed ourselves to God, the living God; and He has led us; and we believe that He will lead us. He has taught us; and we believe that He will teach us still. He has prospered us, and we believe that He will prosper us still: and therefore we will train up our children after us to go on the path which has brought us hither, freely to use their minds, boldly to prove all things, and hold fast that which is good; manfully to go forward, following Truth whithersoever she may lead them; trusting in God, the Father of Lights, asking Him for wisdom, who giveth to all liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given them.|$|E
60|$|On a {{superficial}} view we {{may seem to}} differ very widely {{from each other in}} our reasonings, and no less in our pleasures: but, notwithstanding this difference, which I think to be rather apparent than real, it is probable that the standard both of reason and taste is the same in all human creatures. For if there were not some principles of judgment as well as of sentiment common to all mankind, no hold could possibly be taken either on their reason or their passions, sufficient to maintain the ordinary correspondence of life. It appears, indeed, to be generally acknowledged, that with regard to truth and falsehood there is something fixed. We find people in their disputes continually appealing to certain tests and standards, which are allowed on all sides, and are supposed to be established in our common nature. But there is not the same obvious concurrence in any uniform or settled principles which relate to taste. It is even commonly supposed that this delicate and aerial faculty, which seems too volatile to endure even the chains of a definition, cannot be properly tried by any test, nor regulated by any standard. There is so continual a call for the exercise of the reasoning facility; and it is so much strengthened by perpetual contention, that certain maxims of right reason seem to be tacitly settled amongst the most ignorant. The learned have improved on this rude science, and reduced those maxims into a system. If taste has not been so happily cultivated, it was not that the subject was barren, but that the laborers were few or negligent; for, to say <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> not the same interesting motives to impel us to fix the one, which urge us to ascertain the other. And, after all, if men differ in their opinion concerning such matters, their difference is not attended with the same important consequences; else I make no doubt but that the logic of taste, if I may be allowed the expression, might very possibly be as well digested, and we might come to discuss matters of this nature with as much certainty, as those which seem more immediately within the province of mere reason. And, indeed, it is very necessary, at the entrance into such an inquiry as our present, to make this point as clear as possible; for if taste has no fixed principles, if the imagination is not affected according to some invariable and certain laws, our labor is likely to be employed to very little purpose; as it must be judged an useless, if not an absurd undertaking, to lay down rules for caprice, and to set up for a legislator of whims and fancies.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> more of Cubism {{in great}} {{painting}} than we dream, and the extravagances of the Cubists {{may serve to}} open our eyes to beauties we have always felt without quite understanding.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pshaw! What do I {{want with}} a wife? Do {{you mean to}} say that my father has told you that he intends to clog his legacy with the burden of a wife? I would not accept it with such a burden,--unless I could choose the wife myself. To tell <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a girl--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... ''Tis a lady's secret,' said Lord Montfort. 'But let us {{return to}} our argument. To be brief: either, my dear Armine, you must be {{convinced}} by my reasoning, or I must remain here a prisoner like yourself; for, to tell you <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a fair lady before whom I cannot present myself except in your company.' ...|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, the Troggs {{come into}} town one day, and the diamond is {{returned}} to them. But soon they learn <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> <b>There</b> <b>are</b> 1000 of them and can power all sorts of electronic devices as well as start fires. Also learning that Doon and many others lived in Ember before them, and that they left and evacuated because Ember was dying, the Troggs came to live in Sparks as well.|$|E
50|$|Sikhs {{reject the}} caste system and promote social and gender equality, as {{the soul is}} the same for both men and women. All are equal in the eyes of God. God is {{accessible}} without priests or a middle person. Sikhs and Jains, like Hindus, are expected to be tolerant of all faiths and do not believe that any one path has a monopoly on <b>the</b> <b>Truth.</b> <b>There</b> <b>are</b> many paths to seek out the Love of God and incur Divine Grace. In fact to call another's path inferior is a sign of ignorance and intolerance. Both personal devotion and communal prayers are a part of Sikh's way of life.|$|E
50|$|SCAPIN: To {{tell you}} <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> few things {{impossible}} {{to me when}} I once set about them. Heaven has bestowed on me a fair enough share of genius for the making up of all those neat strokes of mother wit, for all those ingenious gallantries to which the ignorant and vulgar give the name of impostures; and I can boast, without vanity, {{that there have been}} very few men more skilful than I in expedients and intrigues, and who have acquired a greater reputation in the noble profession. But, to tell the truth, merit is too ill rewarded nowadays, and I have given up everything of the kind since the trouble I had through a certain affair that happened to me.|$|E
60|$|To own <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{a little}} bravado in this, {{mingled with the}} stern courage that habit and nature had both contributed to lend the serjeant.
