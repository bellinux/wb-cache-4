5|$|Yeats is {{generally}} {{considered one of the}} twentieth century key English language poets. He was a Symbolist poet, using allusive imagery and symbolic structures throughout his career. He chose words and assembled them so that, in addition to a particular meaning, they suggest abstract thoughts <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> more significant and resonant. His use of symbols is usually something physical that is both itself and a suggestion of other, perhaps immaterial, timeless qualities.|$|E

25|$|Another {{argument}} against the axiom of choice is that it implies the existence of objects <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> counterintuitive. One example is the Banach–Tarski paradox which {{says that it is}} possible to decompose the 3-dimensional solid unit ball into finitely many pieces and, using only rotations and translations, reassemble the pieces into two solid balls each with the same volume as the original. The pieces in this decomposition, constructed using the axiom of choice, are non-measurable sets.|$|E
25|$|Concept Fields {{have many}} objects {{set up to}} allow players to remain hidden from their opponents. A concept field is a perfect {{man-made}} creation for paintball games. A field in this style is usually outdoors and almost always has a theme. Urban concept fields are often seen filled with cars, buildings, and other elements that {{are found in the}} city, though some concept field creators go all out and put together themes <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> a bit over the top to those who aren't familiar with the sport.|$|E
25|$|In 73 {{individual}} cases reviewed by Evers and Ellger, 57 patients heard tunes that were familiar, while 5 heard unfamiliar tunes. These tunes ranged from religious pieces to childhood favorites, and also included popular {{songs from the}} radio. Vocal and instrumental forms of classical music were also identified in some patients. Keshavan found that the consistent feature of musical hallucinations was that it represented a personal memory trace. Memory traces refer to anything <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> familiar to the patient, which indicated why certain childhood or familiar songs were heard.|$|E

500|$|On the contrary, one of {{the most}} notable {{features}} of his philosophical outlook was an unwavering insistence on a series of points <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> obvious but which are nevertheless all-too-frequently neglected: that moral or ethical thought is part of human life; that in writing about it, philosophers are writing about something of genuine importance; that {{it is not easy to}} say anything worth saying about the subject; that what moral philosophers write is answerable to the realities of human history, psychology, and social affairs; and that mere cleverness is indeed not the relevant measure of value." ...|$|E
500|$|A Thousand Splendid Suns {{received}} significant {{praise from}} reviewers, with Publishers Weekly calling it [...] "a powerful, harrowing depiction of Afghanistan" [...] and USA Today describing the prose as [...] "achingly beautiful". Lisa See of The New York Times attributed the book's success to Hosseini [...] " [...] {{the power of}} emotion as few other popular writers do". Natasha Walter from The Guardian wrote, [...] "Hosseini is skilled at telling {{a certain kind of}} story, in which events <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> unbearable - violence, misery and abuse - are made readable. He doesn't gloss over the horrors his characters live through, but something about his direct, explanatory style and the sense that you are moving towards a redemptive ending makes the whole narrative, for all its tragedies, slip down rather easily." ...|$|E

These and other articles and public letters critical of the new Constitution would eventually become known as the [...] "Anti-Federalist Papers". In response, Hamilton decided to launch a measured defense and extensive explanation of the proposed Constitution {{to the people of the}} state of New York.

500|$|Reviews of the DS {{remake of}} Final Fantasy III have been mostly positive, {{with the game}} holding an {{aggregate}} score of 77% on GameRankings. 1UP.com described the gameplay as [...] "an RPG for dedicated RPG enthusiasts," [...] and noted that while the job system had been heavily improved over the original title, it still felt at times [...] "very limiting." [...] The review however stated {{that it was important}} to remember Final Fantasy III as [...] "a slice of history and a missing piece of a blockbuster series," [...] citing that [...] "hardcore RPG players" [...] may enjoy the title more than other Final Fantasy games and calling it [...] "one of the best portable RPGs to date." [...] GameSpy argued that one's enjoyment hinged [...] "entirely on your desire to play a game with decidedly archaic game mechanics <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> primitive and uninviting" [...] compared to other recent Square Enix titles, noting the game was [...] "quite challenging" [...] and adding that [...] "some people live for this stuff, but others may be annoyed at the game's often unfriendly nature." ...|$|E
500|$|Raja Sen of Rediff {{gave the}} film 4 stars out of 5 and wrote, [...] "Rockstar is a simple, unspectacular tale, {{sometimes}} even predictable, but director Imtiaz Ali masterfully weaves in details that draw us in." [...] Aniruddha Guha of DNA too gave the film 4 out of 5 {{saying that the}} film was [...] "like an effective crescendo that leaves you wanting more." [...] Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India also gave the film 4 out of 5 and stated that [...] "The highpoint of Rockstar is it's high tension, high-on-passion romance between two unlikely people". Sukanya Verma of Rediff rated it 3.5 stars out of 5 and said, [...] "Rockstar is flawed but fabulous." [...] Mayank Shekhar of Hindustan Times also gave a rating of 3.5 out of 5 and noted [...] "The canvas is wide like early Sanjay Leela Bhansali's; bird's view of the stunning bridge is very Mani Ratnam; witty, earthy dialogues are so Vishal Bhardwaj. Director Imitiaz Ali manages to retain a personal, auteur's touch in a genre vastly commercial, mainstream. This is a rare feat." [...] Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, and said [...] "On the whole, Rockstar does {{not live up to}} the confidence and expectations from the otherwise very skilled and accomplished film-maker Imtiaz Ali." [...] Hrithik Sharma of El Viaje Reviews included it into his select list of Bollywood classics and says that [...] "Rockstar is a unique cocktail of 50% drama, 40% romance and 10% comedy. What stands out is the music by A. R. Rahman. Each song in the film is a masterpiece and fits very well into the plot. Cinematography is realistic but prepossessing indeed. The film gets a 10 on 10 in this department. There are certain scenes in the film <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> unrelated to the plot but those would be the scenes that would stay with you longer." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN also gave 3 stars out of 5, commenting [...] "Imtiaz Ali's Rockstar is a far-from-perfect film, but it has honesty and depth, which is mostly missing in Hindi movies today." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1916, Weber {{explained}} her {{philosophy of}} directing films: [...] "I'll never {{be convinced that}} the general public does not want serious entertainment rather than frivolous", and [...] "A real director should be absolute. He (or she in this case) alone knows the effects he wants to produce, and he alone should have authority in the arrangement, cutting, titling or anything else <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> necessary to do to the finished product.

2500|$|The end came soon thereafter. Charles {{sued for}} peace and the Dutch {{achieved}} most of their war aims with the Treaty of Breda (1667). The Dutch declined to take back New Amsterdam in exchange for Surinam, a decision <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> unconscionable in modern American eyes, but which in {{the circumstances of the}} time must be deemed completely rational: the sugar plantations of Surinam were certainly more valuable than the already hard-pressed fur traders in their environment of hostile New-Englanders.

2500|$|In 1874 Carl Wernicke {{proposed}} [...] {{that the}} ability to imitate speech {{plays a key role in}} language acquisition. This is now a widely researched issue in child development. [...] A study of 17,000 one and two word utterances made by six children between 18 months to 25 months found that, depending upon the particular infant, between 5% and 45% of their words might be mimicked. These figures are minima since they concern only immediately heard words. Many words <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> spontaneous are in fact delayed imitations heard days or weeks previously. At 13 months children who imitate new words (but not ones they already know) show a greater increase in noun vocabulary at four months and non noun vocabulary at eight months. A major predictor of vocabulary increase in both 20 months, 24 months, and older children [...] between 4 and 8 years is their skill in repeating nonword phone sequences (a measure of mimicry and storage). [...] This is also the case with children with Down's syndrome [...] The effect is larger than even age: in a study of 222 two-year-old children that had spoken vocabularies ranging between 3–601 words the ability to repeat nonwords accounted for 24% of the variance compared to 15% for age and 6% for gender (girls better than boys).|$|E
