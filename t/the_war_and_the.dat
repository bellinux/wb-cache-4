5|$|Controversy {{surrounds}} the recipient, {{the fate of}} her sons, and the authorship of the letter.

5|$|The battle {{demonstrated}} U.S. {{air supremacy}} in the Pacific theater by {{this stage in}} <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> vulnerability of surface ships without air cover to aerial attack. The battle also exhibited Japan's willingness to sacrifice entire ships, even the pride of its fleet, in desperate kamikaze attacks aimed at slowing the Allied advance on the Japanese home islands.|$|E
5|$|After Germany's {{defeat in}} <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{signing of the}} Armistice in November 1918, Friedrich der Grosse {{and most of the}} capital ships of the High Seas Fleet were interned by the British Royal Navy in Scapa Flow. The ships were {{disarmed}} and reduced to skeleton crews while the Allied powers negotiated {{the final version of the}} Treaty of Versailles. On 21 June 1919, days before the treaty was signed, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, ordered the fleet to be scuttled to ensure that the British would not be able to seize the ships. Friedrich der Grosse was raised in 1936 and broken up for scrap metal. Her bell was returned to Germany in 1965 and is now located at the Fleet Headquarters in Glücksburg.|$|E

5|$|After an unopposed landing, a mixed {{force of}} German reservists and half-trained Melanesian police mounted a stout {{resistance}} {{and forced the}} Australians to fight {{their way to the}} objective. After a day of fighting during which both sides suffered casualties, Australian forces captured the wireless station at Bita Paka. The battle was Australia's first major military engagement of <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> only significant action of the campaign; in its aftermath the remaining German forces on New Britain fled inland to Toma. Following a brief siege there the German garrison capitulated, ending resistance to the Australian occupation of the island.|$|E

5|$|After the US entered <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> British Army {{recovered}} from its earlier defeats, it defeated the Germans and Italians at the Second Battle of El Alamein in North Africa in 1942–1943 and helped drive them from Africa. It then fought through Italy and, {{with the help}} of American, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, Indian and Free French forces, took part in the D-Day invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944; nearly half the Allied soldiers were British. In the Far East, the British Army rallied against the Japanese in the Burma Campaign and regained the British Far Eastern colonial possessions.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Belarus {{was among}} the 51 {{founding}} countries of the United Nations Charter and as such it was allowed an additional vote at the UN, {{on top of the}} Soviet Union's vote. Vigorous postwar reconstruction promptly followed the end of <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Byelorussian SSR became a major center of manufacturing in western USSR, creating jobs and attracting ethnic Russians. The borders of the Byelorussian SSR and Poland were redrawn and became known as the Curzon Line.|$|E
5|$|Although Morton {{was able}} to keep the state united during {{the first phase of the}} war, once {{emancipation}} became an issue in 1862, the Republicans suffered a major defeat in the mid-term elections, and Morton lost the support of the strong Democratic majority in the legislature. Before the new legislature convened in 1863, Morton began circulating reports that the Democrats intended to seize control of the state government, secede from the Union, and instigate riots. The Democrats responded with harsh criticisms of Morton and Lincoln, the conduct of <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> issues of emancipation and the loss of constitutional rights, among others. Accusations on both sides created a tense atmosphere that only worsened relation between the two parties and guaranteed further confrontations.|$|E

5|$|Another {{conflict}} {{that is part}} of the party's background was the Algerian War (many frontistes, including Le Pen, were directly involved in <b>the</b> <b>war),</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> right-wing dismay over the decision by French President Charles de Gaulle to abandon his promise of holding on to French Algeria. In the 1965 presidential election, Le Pen unsuccessfully attempted to consolidate the right-wing vote around the right-wing presidential candidate Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the French far-right consisted mainly of small extreme movements such as Occident, Groupe Union Défense (GUD), and the Ordre Nouveau (ON).|$|E
5|$|Apple River Fort, today {{known as}} the Apple River Fort State Historic Site, {{was one of many}} {{frontier}} forts hastily completed by settlers in northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin following the onset of the 1832 Black Hawk War. Located in present-day Elizabeth, Illinois, United States, the fort at the Apple River settlement was built in less than a week. It {{was one of the few}} forts attacked during <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> only one attacked by a band led by Black Hawk himself. At the Battle of Apple River Fort, a firefight of about an hour ensued, with Black Hawk's forces eventually withdrawing. The fort suffered one militia man killed in action, and another wounded. After the war, the fort stood until 1847, being occupied by squatters before being sold to a private property owner who dismantled the building.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as using}} events from his past, Fleming also used names of {{individuals}} he knew {{for some of}} his characters. The editor of The London Magazine, Alan Ross, had provided Fleming with details {{about the effects of}} the electroshock therapy that Bond went through and, by way of thanks, the novel's SIS station chief in Jamaica, Commander Ross, was named after him. Similarly, Fleming used the name of the secretary of the Royal St George's Golf Club, Mark Nicholson, for the CIA representative at the hotel. Tony Hugill, the sugar planter mentioned in the novel, was named after a member of Fleming's 30 AU unit who managed the Tate & Lyle plantations in West Indies after <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> book's main villain, Francisco Scaramanga, was named after George Scaramanga, an Etonian contemporary of Fleming's: the pair are said to have fought at school.|$|E
