It's meant to be, 'This is my shield, this is my weapon, this is my inner sense of fame, this is my monster.' Gaga also said that the video shows [...] "how the entertainment industry can, in a metaphorical way, simulate human trafficking - products being sold, the woman perceived as a commodity."

She said there was overcapacity in the fishing industry and that fish processing plants would need to close. Minister Jackman, who represents a district that relies heavily on the fishing industry, continued to face much criticism for his performance in the fisheries portfolio and was re-elected by just 40 votes. The day after winning a majority government, Dunderdale stated in an interview <b>that</b> <b>tough</b> decisions were looming in the industry. She again stated there was overcapacity and structural problems in the fishery and that her government was ready to make the tough decisions that were long overdue. Dunderdale swore in her new cabinet weeks after the election and shuffled Jackman to the Department to Education, Darin King succeeded him as the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the show, Lana Lang is {{characterized}} as the girl next door. As Kreuk describes her, she is the [...] "beautiful, popular girl who is really lonely". She has a [...] "hole in her heart", because of the loss of her parents, and feels empathy for everyone. Kristin feels that deep down the character is a [...] "tough girl", and that Lex manages to bring that side of her out more. For instance, he convinces her to fight back against a rival coffee shop that is spreading rumors about The Talon – the coffee shop that she joint owns with Lex. Unfortunately, <b>that</b> <b>tough</b> side is not seen in the first season. According to Kreuk, the character was never placed in situations where she could show her outgoing side, because she was left to communicate primarily with Whitney and Clark. Kreuk thinks that Lana [...] "lived in her head a little bit"; she was intelligent enough to read classical books, but would also read romantic novels [...] "on the sly".|$|E

She further clarified {{that she did not}} intend to write an angry song, [...] "Swizz's [...] had <b>that</b> <b>tough</b> vibe, like the guy had cheated, and I wanted to write something honest. If you're in a relationship, even if the man's cheating and you end up not wanting him, the thought of another woman benefiting from the lessons you taught him." [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] features Knowles as the female protagonist impersonating a threatened woman involved in a love triangle. She is unwilling to allow another woman to profit from all the efforts she put on to make her lover a better man. Frances Romero of Time magazine noted that Knowles' anger is due to her man's wandering eye, her desire to leave, and the thought of having to give him up to some unworthy woman.|$|E
500|$|Sean Connery was {{the first}} actor to portray Bond on film in Dr. No (1962). An amateur bodybuilder, {{he had come to}} the {{attention}} of the Bond film producers after several appearances in British films from the late 1950s. At a muscular 6'2", Fleming originally disapproved of his casting as James Bond, believing him to be an overgrown stuntman who lacked the finesse and elegance to play James Bond; he envisaged a suave actor, such as David Niven playing the role. Producer Albert R. Broccoli—known to all as Cubby—disagreed with Fleming's view, later commenting that [...] "I wanted a ballsy guy... put a bit of veneer over <b>that</b> <b>tough</b> Scottish hide and you've got Fleming's Bond instead of all the mincing poofs we had applying for the job". Eon's choice of Connery was also based on his looks and sex appeal, an appeal that would later be echoed by Honor Blackman who said, after appearing with Connery in Goldfinger, [...] "He was exceedingly handsome, virile and sexy and that really was the tenor of what the script was always trying to display". After Connery was chosen, director Terence Young took the actor to his tailor and hairdresser, and introduced him to the high life, restaurants, casinos and women of London. In the words of Bond writer Raymond Benson, Young educated the actor [...] "in the ways of being dapper, witty, and above all, cool".|$|E

The Independent reported that according to their Whitehall sources, Mandelson was persuaded <b>that</b> <b>tough</b> laws were needed to reduce online copyright infringement following an intensive lobbying campaign by influential people in the music and film industry. The paper also reported that this included a meeting with DreamWorks co-founder David Geffen at the Rothschild family villa on the Greek island of Corfu. Mandelson's spokesperson claimed that there had been no discussion of internet piracy during the Corfu dinner and suggested that the decision to reverse Lord Carter's findings had been taken in late July before the trip. The Times reported after the Corfu meeting that an unnamed Whitehall source had confirmed that before this trip, Mandelson had shown little personal interest in the Digital Britain agenda, which has been ongoing for several years. According to the source of The Times, Mandelson returned from holiday and effectively issued an edict that the regulation needed to be tougher.|$|E

However, Show shook hands with his former rival Triple H, and left, intentionally getting himself counted out, and turning heel in the process {{for the first time}} since August 2013. The following night on the November 24 episode of Raw, Big Show explained his actions, stating he has a family to care for and the Authority had created issues for him in the past, thus he had to make <b>that</b> <b>tough</b> decision. He was interrupted by Erick Rowan who referred to him as a bully, and igniting a feud for turning his back on the team. Big Show faced Rowan in a first ever Steel Stairs match at [...] pay-per-view, which he won. Later in the event, Show attacked John Cena during his match with Seth Rollins but was then confronted by Roman Reigns, leading to Cena winning the match. This started a feud between Show and Reigns, which resulted in Reigns defeating Show multiple times by count-out and disqualification. On January 25, 2015, at the Royal Rumble, Big Show entered the Rumble match at #29, eliminating five superstars before being eliminated by Reigns, the eventual winner. At Fastlane, Big Show, Seth Rollins and Kane defeated Dolph Ziggler, Erick Rowan and Ryback when Kane pinned Ziggler. Big Show won the 2nd Annual André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal at WrestleMania 31. Show later reignited his feud with Roman Reigns after attacking him during his triple threat match against Ryback and Randy Orton on the April 6th episode of Raw and chokeslamming him on a taxi cab on the April 12th episode of Raw.
