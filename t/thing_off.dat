5|$|During a {{brainstorm}} session, Michael, Jim, and Dwight {{decide to}} set up a sting operation to observe Danny's sales techniques. They set up Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) as the CEO of the fictional company Solartech in Dwight's office, fitted with security cameras, and watch from another room. Danny is then sent in to try to make a sale. All starts well until Meredith attempts to seduce him. Dwight and Jim send in Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) and Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) to save the sting. When Meredith strong-arms both of them, Michael rushes in to call the whole <b>thing</b> <b>off.</b> Danny becomes infuriated and walks off. Michael catches up to him and offers him a job, pointing out that with Sabre's better pricing, he could make more sales as a traveling salesman for them. He accepts the offer, and Michael introduces him as the new salesman to the office. The rest of the sales staff act disrespectful towards him, worrying that Danny will take their clients. Michael tells them how well sales numbers will go up with Danny {{as a part of the}} branch, and that he is not going to rescind Danny's job offer just because it makes the other salespeople uncomfortable. Before Dwight leaves for the day, he viciously insults Danny about his alleged mistreatment of Pam and client-stealing past, then immediately welcomes him to the company.|$|E
500|$|Apple Records {{released}} Living in the Material World on 30 May 1973. [...] "Be Here Now" [...] {{appeared as}} the second track on side two of the original LP format, following what Rodriguez describes as the [...] "funky uptempo" [...] "The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord)". It marked {{the first of four}} consecutive ballads on that side, which some music critics objected to at the time. Never a fan of Harrison's solo work, Robert Christgau would comment on the album: [...] "Harrison sings as if he's doing sitar impressions, and four different people, including a little man in my head who I never noticed before, have expressed intense gratitude when I turned the damned <b>thing</b> <b>off</b> during 'Be Here Now'." ...|$|E
500|$|McGovern {{enrolled}} at small Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell {{and became a}} star student there. He supplemented a forensic scholarship by working a variety of odd jobs. With World War II underway overseas and feeling insecure about his own courage, McGovern took flying lessons in an Aeronca aircraft and received a pilot's license through the government's Civilian Pilot Training Program. McGovern recalled: [...] "Frankly, I {{was scared to death}} on that first solo flight. But when I walked away from it, I had an enormous feeling of satisfaction that I had taken the <b>thing</b> <b>off</b> the ground and landed it without tearing the wings off." [...] In late 1940 or early 1941, McGovern had a brief affair with an acquaintance that resulted in her giving birth to a daughter during 1941, although this did not become public knowledge during his lifetime. In April 1941, McGovern began dating fellow student Eleanor Stegeberg, who had grown up in Woonsocket, South Dakota. They had first encountered each other during a high school debate in which Eleanor and her twin sister Ila defeated McGovern and his partner.|$|E

500|$|While the {{sequence}} featuring Mercedes singing [...] "I Will Always Love You" [...] {{was very well}} received, Entertainment Weekly Joseph Brannigan Lynch was not happy {{about the state of}} Mercedes and Sam's relationship: [...] "If these two don't get together soon, I'm voting we just call the whole <b>thing</b> <b>off,</b> because I'm tired of these false starts." [...] VanDerWerff, referring to the third member of that romantic triangle, wrote that one of the two [...] "tertiary characters" [...] he responded to most was [...] "Shane, who didn’t say anything but gave good cry-face". VanDerWerff's other character was Karofsky, and Michael Slezak of TVLine characterized his scene with Kurt as [...] "electric, with Kurt tenderly giving the 'just friends' speech to Dave". Lynch thought the plot of having Karofsky be Kurt's secret admirer was [...] "vaguely stalker-ish on Karofsky's part, and contrived {{on the part of the}} show", and Canning accurately predicted that after Karofsky had been seen by his classmate, it would [...] "just be an episode or two before Karofsky gets bullied into thinking about suicide, if not actually taking his own life".|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Carina Chocano praised The O.C. {{for being}} different, {{claiming}} {{that it was}} [...] "refreshingly free of both [...] Spelling-style camp and the twee earnestness that has characterized more recent teen dramas". Robert Bianco of USA Today drew comparisons with the successful Fox show Beverly Hills, 90210, saying that [...] "The O.C. is better-written and better-acted by a cast that just might be, incredibly enough, even better-looking". He praised the cast's skill and attractiveness {{as well as the}} show's ability to [...] "come up with a few smart deviations from the genre norm". Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker criticized the plot for being too predictable, but praised Adam Brody as Seth, stating that [...] "he talks too much and too fast, he mumbles, and he projects zero physical confidence. In short, his character is adorable." [...] Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette felt that [...] " [...] McKenzie, at times, is prone to overdramatizing scenes", and considered the young characters [...] "so detestable and yet bland" [...] that it made the show [...] "almost painful" [...] to watch. He nevertheless affirmed that the show had [...] "positive attributes" [...] that made it enjoyable. Andrew Grossman of The Boston Globe commented that [...] "Brody is instantly likable as Seth" [...] and that Barton [...] "does a nice job with Marissa's torn-between-two-worlds angst", but stated that Ryan [...] "doesn't seem to have many clear personality traits". Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle called the episode [...] "superb" [...] and described McKenzie as [...] "essentially playing James Dean". He compared the actor to Russell Crowe and noted that McKenzie [...] "pull the whole <b>thing</b> <b>off</b> with aplomb".|$|E
2500|$|Although Knievel never {{attempted}} to jump the Grand Canyon, rumors of the Canyon jump were started by Knievel himself in 1968, following the Caesars Palace crash. [...] During a 1968 interview, Knievel stated, [...] "I don't {{care if they}} say, 'Look, kid, you're going to drive that <b>thing</b> <b>off</b> {{the edge of the}} Canyon and die,' I'm going to do it. I want to be the first. If they'd {{let me go to the}} moon, I'd crawl all the way to Cape Kennedy just to do it. I'd like to go to the moon, but I don't want to be the second man to go there." [...] For the next several years, Knievel negotiated with the federal government to secure a jumping site and develop various concept bikes to make the jump, but the Interior Department denied him airspace over the northern Arizona canyon. Knievel switched his attention in 1971 to the Snake River Canyon in southern Idaho.|$|E

2500|$|The album {{received}} mixed reviews. Review normalizer Metacritic {{gave the}} album 50 out of 100 based on 9 critical reviews. Andy Kellman of AllMusic said [...] "Timbaland does not stock Shock Value II with quite as many guests, and performs {{a higher percentage}} of the vocals, and what results is less schizophrenic and more directly pop than its antecedent. The highs here are not as high, and the lows are as low, unless you consider the very presence of Chad Kroeger and Daughtry, or the unveiling of Brandy’s rapping alter ego Bran’ Nu, to be more odious than a sub-Coldplay ballad. [...] That said, it is a mildly entertaining album—as long as you block out most of the lyrics." [...] David Balls of Digital Spy agreed saying that [...] "Timbaland dips into his usual bag of production tricks here and many of the supporting cast dutifully return, but never does this quite reach the same excitement levels as its predecessor. [...] it feels as though Tim's trying so hard to impress us with his pimped-up SUV that he's driven the <b>thing</b> <b>off</b> the road. The result? A disparate, disjointed collection of songs that feels like less {{than the sum of its}} parts. Where Shock Value was fresh and innovative, much of the sequel could pass for leftovers from its predecessor. [...] He now seems to be lagging behind rivals like David Guetta and will.iam when it comes to driving the urban pop genre forward" ...|$|E
2500|$|Next morning, Thursday, Sasun Eff. {{came in at}} 10; I {{took him}} {{straight}} to Sir Percy and left them. Half an hour later, he returned {{and told me that}} he had accepted and I understood the full significance of the Nunc Dimittis. He asked me what he could now do to help and I sent him straight to the Naqib. The leading Shi'ah of Baghdad had also refused to join the Council and it was essential to get him in. In the midst of this talk Sir Percy sent for me. I left Sasun to Mr Philby and went to consult with Sir Percy. We agreed that I should send at once for Ja'far, tell him what had happened and bid him bestir himself. It was past one o'clock before I caught Ja'far. We had the most extraordinary conversation. He told me he had come into the Cabinet, only to defeat Talib, that he distrusted and loathed him and regarded it as shameful that he should be one of the leading persons of Mesopotamia. I said that the Mesopotamians themselves had made him, by their fear and their servility, and that it was for them to unmake him if they wished. We then discussed how to win over the extremists, I assured him that that was Sir Percy's chief desire and taking heart, he asked if he might talk to Sir Percy. I took him at once to Sir Percy and left them together, with the assured conviction that Sir Percy was the best exponent of his own policy.”… “Oh, if we can pull this <b>thing</b> <b>off!</b> rope together the young hotheads, and the Shi'ah obscurantists, and enthusiasts like Ja'far, polished old statesmen like Sasun, and scholars like Shukri—if we can make them work together and find their own salvation for themselves, what a fine thing it will be.
