In first part is more closely {{described}} the method of <b>tube</b> <b>flaring.</b> <b>Tube</b> <b>flaring</b> was chosen for analysis of biaxial stress, in this thesis particularly in the presence of high strain rate. In the second part is more closely described influence of high strain rate on the forming process. There is described influence of high strain rate on behavior of the material, hardening, change of quasi-static yield strength to the dynamic yield strength, influence of high strain rate on the microstructure and more. During the description of these processes there is effort to describe the cause of these changes as well. For this task was used domestic and foreign literature, as well as peer review papers whose authors study intensively this problematic. Besides all of the above there is also derived the velocity of elastic and plastic wave. In the end is evaluated experiment, in which was done <b>tube</b> <b>flaring,</b> which is part of this master thesis.

40|$|AbstractWith the {{implementation}} of environmental protection, sustainable development and conservation-oriented policies, components and parts of thin-walled welded tubes have gained increasing application in the aircraft and automotive industries because of their advantages: easily achieving forming and manufacturing process at low cost and in a short time. The current research on welded tube plastic forming is mainly concentrated on tube internal high-pressure forming, tube bending forming, and tube spinning forming. The focuses are on the material properties and characterization of welded tubes, finite element modeling for welded tube forming, and inhomogeneous deformation behavior and the mechanism and rules of deformation coordination in welded tube plastic forming. This paper summarizes the research progress in welded tube plastic forming from these aspects. Finally, {{with a focus on}} the urgent demand of the aviation, aerospace and automotive industries for high-strength and light-weight tubes, this paper discusses the development trends and challenges in the theory and technology of welded tube plastic forming in the future. Among them, laser tailor-welded technology will find application in the manufacture of high-strength steel tubes. Tube-end forming technology, such as <b>tube</b> <b>flaring</b> and flanging technology, will expand its application in welded tubes. Therefore, future studies will focus on the FE modeling regarding how to consider effects of welding on residual stresses, welding distortions and microstructure, the inhomogeneous deformation and coordination mechanism of the plastic forming process of tailor-welded tubes, and some end-forming processes of welded tubes, and more comprehensive research on the forming mechanism and limit of welded tubes...|$|R

40|$|We have {{compared}} the liability of four laryngeal mask airway (LMA) devices (standard, flexible, intubating and reusable) and a tracheal tube to thermal damage from KTP and Nd:YAG lasers at two power densities used commonly in airway surgery: 570 W cm and 1140 W cm. Eighty-five airway devices were tested: 24 standard LMA (silicone-based), 12 flexible LMA (silicone-based, metal wires), 24 disposable LMA (PVC-based), one intubating LMA (silicone and steel-based) and 24 PVC-based tracheal tubes. Comparisons were made during laser strike to eight different targets: the unmarked and marked {{part of the}} airway device tube; the unmarked part of the airway device tube after application of blood; the cuff filled with air or methylene blue dye; the unmarked flexible LMA tube on or between the metal wires; and the epiglottic elevator bar of the intubating LMA. The laser strike was continued for 30 s and each target was tested three times. Three different, but identical, impact sites were used for each target. There was no ignition of any airway device with either power density or laser type. The silicone-based LMA were generally more resistant to flaring and penetration than the PVC-based LMA and tracheal tube, but the intubating LMA <b>tube</b> <b>flared</b> more rapidly with the KTP laser, and the disposable LMA cuff was more resistant to penetration. Print markings, blood and the metal wires of the flexible LMA reduced the thermal resistance of the tube. Filling the cuff with methylene blue dye increased the thermal resistance of all airway devices. We conclude that the silicone-based LMA devices were more thermal resistant to KTP and Nd:YAG laser strike than PVC-based devices {{with the exception of}} the disposable LMA cuff and the intubating LMA tube...|$|R

50|$|The tenor saxophone, {{like all}} saxophones, {{consists}} of an approximately conical tube of thin brass, a type of metal. The wider end of the <b>tube</b> is <b>flared</b> slightly to form a bell, while the narrower end is connected to a single reed mouthpiece {{similar to that of}} the clarinet. At intervals down the bore are placed between 20 and 23 tone holes; these are covered by pads which can be pressed onto the holes to form an airtight seal. There are also two small speaker holes which, when opened, disrupt the lower harmonics of the instrument and cause it to overblow into an upper register. The pads are controlled by pressing a number of keys with the fingers of the left and right hands; the left thumb controls an octave key which opens one or other of the speaker holes. The original design of tenor saxophone had a separate octave key for each speaker hole, in the manner of the bassoon; the mechanism by which the correct speaker hole is selected based on the fingering of the left hand (specifically the left ring finger) was developed soon after Sax's patent expired in 1866.|$|R

40|$|Magnetized plasma jets are {{generally}} modeled as magnetic flux tubes filled with flowing plasma governed by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). We outline here {{a more fundamental}} approach based on flux tubes of canonical vorticity, where canonical vorticity {{is defined as the}} circulation of the species canonical momentum. This approach extends the concept of magnetic flux tube evolution to include the effects of finite particle momentum and enables visualization of the topology of plasma jets in regimes beyond MHD. A flared, current-carrying magnetic flux tube in an ion-electron plasma with finite ion momentum is thus equivalent to either a pair of electron and ion flow flux tubes, a pair of electron and ion canonical momentum flux tubes, or a pair of electron and ion canonical vorticity flux tubes. We examine the morphology of all these flux tubes for increasing electrical currents, different radial current profiles, different electron Mach numbers, and a fixed, flared, axisymmetric magnetic geometry. Calculations of gauge-invariant relative canonical helicities track the evolution of magnetic, cross, and kinetic helicities in the system, and show that ion flow fields can unwind to compensate for an increasing magnetic twist. The results demonstrate that including a species finite momentum can result in a very long collimated canonical vorticity flux tube even if the magnetic flux <b>tube</b> is <b>flared.</b> With finite momentum, particle density gradients must be normal to canonical vorticities, not to magnetic fields, so observations of collimated astrophysical jets could be images of canonical vorticity flux tubes instead of magnetic flux tubes.
