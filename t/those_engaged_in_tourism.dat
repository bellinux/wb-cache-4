40|$|Positioning medical <b>tourism</b> <b>in</b> {{the broader}} {{framework}} of health tourism Many terms {{are used to}} describe the relationship between health and <b>tourism</b> <b>in</b> the framework of special tourism products such as health tourism, medical tourism, hos-pital / clinical tourism, wellness tourism, and sometimes travel medicine, often con-ceptually completely inconsistently. Th e aim {{of this paper is to}} precisely defi ne medical tourism within the numerous types of tourism and position it clearly in the complex framework of health tourism. To create some kind or form of tourism it is necessary to have, on the one hand, a signifi cantly large group of consumers that wish to satisfy their leisure or non leisure needs in the same or similar ways and, on the other hand, tourism products need to be created to fulfi ll these needs. In this, many of <b>those</b> not <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> <b>tourism</b> need to be reminded that tourism goes beyond travel motivations, travel needs, activities and tourism attractions centere...|$|R

This article seeks to broaden knowledge in this field {{in the case of}} Spain. With this aim, models of probability are applied (probit models) to a sample of international tourists to analyse the factors that improve the chances of them being cultural tourists in Spain in a period of analysis that corresponds to 2013. The results of the research allow recommendations to be made for a <b>tourism</b> policy <b>in</b> the cultural field that has a vision of the future...|$|R
40|$|Culinary {{tourism is}} {{emerging}} as {{an important component of}} the rapidly growing cultural tourism market. It introduces tourists to new flavours and different traditions associated with the preparation, serving, and consuming of foods and beverages. Although food has been strongly linked to <b>tourism</b> <b>in</b> some European and Asian destinations for years, culinary tourism is a relatively new phenomenon in North America. Current research tends to focus on only one aspect of culinary tourism, wine, with most research done in Australia and New Zealand. Although growing, there is still little research in Canada, and it has also concentrated on the wine component of culinary <b>tourism.</b> However, <b>those</b> who <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> wine <b>tourism</b> may not necessarily be the same people who would <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> other culinary practices such as visiting farmer' s fairs and markets, browsing food stores featuring local and gourmet ingredients, or who seek out authentic cuisine in restaurants. This study examines the characteristics and composition of the Canadian culinary tourism market and also explores the relationship between food and wine tourism...|$|R
40|$|Background: Medical tourism, {{thought of}} as {{patients}} seeking non-emergency medical care outside of their homecountries, is a growing industry worldwide. Canadians are amongst <b>those</b> <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> medical <b>tourism,</b> and manyare helped {{in the process of}} accessing care abroad by medical tourism brokers - agents who specialize in makinginternational medical care arrangements for patients. As a key source of information for these patients, brokers arelikely {{to play an important role}} in communicating the risks and benefits of undergoing surgery or other proceduresabroad to their clientele. This raises important ethical concerns regarding processes such as informed consent andthe liability of brokers in the event that complications arise from procedures. The purpose of this article is toexamine the language, information, and online marketing of Canadian medical <b>tourism</b> brokers’ websites <b>in</b> light ofsuch ethical concerns. Methods: An exhaustive online search using multiple search engines and keywords was performed to compile acomprehensive directory of English-language Canadian medical tourism brokerage websites. These websites wereexamined using thematic content analysis, which included identifying informational themes, generating frequencycounts of these themes, and comparing trends in these counts to the established literature. Results: Seventeen websites were identified for inclusion in this study. It was found that Canadian medical tourismbroker websites varied widely in scope, content, professionalism and depth of information. Three themes emergedfrom the thematic content analysis: training and accreditation, risk communication, and business dimensions. Thirdparty accreditation bodies of debatable regulatory value were regularly mentioned on the reviewed websites, anddiscussion of surgical risk was absent on 47 % of the websites reviewed, with limited discussion of risk on theremaining ones. Terminology describing brokers’ roles was somewhat inconsistent across the websites. Finally,brokers’ roles in follow up care, their prices, and the speed of surgery were the most commonly included businessdimensions on the reviewed websites. Conclusion: Canadian medical tourism brokers currently lack a common standard of care and accreditation, and are widely lacking in providing adequate risk communication for potential medical tourists. This has implicationsfor the informed consent and consequent safety of Canadian medical tourists...|$|R

40|$|Marine non-consumptive wildlife-oriented tourism, whereby {{tourists}} observe and/or interact {{closely with}} animals, without purposely having a detrimental effect on them, {{has been growing}} globally in recent decades. Human-mediated feeding (provisioning) is widely used by tour operators to attract target species, facilitate viewing and interaction with tourists. Although potential effects of such provisioning on terrestrial fauna have been given moderate scientific research attention, equivalent research in the marine environment is limited. Effects of provisioning marine wildlife may include direct habituation, behavioural change, and/or dietary impacts among individuals and species. There may also be disruption to the species associated assemblage. It {{was found that the}} literature on the effects of nonconsumptive wildlife tourism is fragmented and results from different areas and taxa are frequently contradictory. Most studies appeared to be of a few years duration, at most. This reflects the relative immaturity of the industry e many enterprises studied typically commenced within the 1990 s. Studies (other than fish) tended to focus on a focal species with few addressing the wider implications for the associated assemblage. Supplementary feeding may also have impacts on the health and wellbeing of provisioned animals. It is concluded that such nature tourism is often not benign e focal species and their assemblage are often disrupted. We conclude that funding to better understand the impacts and thus address them is imperative. To supplement funding for the research and monitoring required, an additional charge could incorporated into the fee charged to <b>those</b> <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> marine wildlife <b>tourism...</b>|$|R
