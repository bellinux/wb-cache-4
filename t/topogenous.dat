40|$|A {{discontinuous}} {{portion of}} the upper bench of the Beckley bed (Westphalian A) in southern West Virginia was examined in regard to its areal distribution, horizontal and vertical trends in chemistry, horizontal trends in petrographic composition, and its facies relationships with encasing sediments. The results of this examination were compared to those of a process model {{for the development of}} ombrogenous mire systems in tidally influenced coastal areas of Sarawak, East Malaysia. The results of these comparisons suggest a strong parallel between the two areas. The ombrogenous mire system that formed the upper bench of the Beckley bed initially developed as small individual <b>topogenous</b> peat swamps in a tidal flat setting. With time, the small individual peat swamps coalesced into an ombrogenous mire system that resulted in a coal bench that covers about 65 sq km. The mire system was eventually covered by channel deposits from a deltaic distributary system. The mire system that developed for the coal bench shows distinct zonation of dull and bright macrolithotypes (dull on the margins and bright in the interior) and contains high concentrations of ash and sulfur in its margins and base. Coal thickness, chemistry and petrographic data allow differentiation of the raised interior from the more <b>topogenous</b> areas of the mire. The interior portions are interpreted as those areas of the bench that are > 65 cm thick and average > 85 % vitrinite group macerals, 5. 5 % ash and 0. 60 % sulfur. The more <b>topogenous</b> areas of the mire system, which were subjected to flooding, oxidation and sediment influx are < 65 cm thick and average < 65 % vitrinite group macerals, 15. 1 % ash and 1. 81 % sulfur. In addition, the amount of preserved cell structure, irrespective of maceral group, appears to increase toward the margins of the bench. These trends are consistent with observations in the peat deposits of Sarawak, East Malaysia...|$|E

30|$|The Barmer lignites are {{characterized}} by a very high GI and moderate TPI which are indicative of a continuous wet condition prevailing in the basin with a moderate subsidence rate. GI values exceeding 10 in all the seams indicate <b>topogenous</b> mire in Barmer basin which was permanently flooded. The GI and TPI values and the petrography-based facies models indicate that the Barmer lignites originated mostly under wet forest swamp to clastic marsh having telmatic to limno-telmatic condition with a moderate rate of subsidence and a very slow fall in ground water table. Considering the thin lignite seams in the basin, it appears that peat accumulation could not keep pace with basin subsidence for long time and the subsidence exceeded peat accumulation rate. The strong positive correlation (r =  0.850) between ash content and sulphur content suggests that clastic sedimentation enhances the tree density and tissue preservation in the Barmer basin.|$|E
40|$|The middle eocene {{to early}} {{oligocene}} Bowmans and Lochiel coal deposits {{of the northern}} St. Vincent Basin, South Australia have been studied to elucidate their depositional environments. These coals occur within predominantly fluvio-lacustrine transgressive system tract sequences that formed during the initial phase of basin infill. The aforementioned facies are unevenly distributed and their stratigraphic succession highlights evolutionary changes in local palaeoenvironments. Within individual seams the transition from subaquatic to <b>topogenous</b> forest swamps and ultimately ombrogenous conditions is most common. However, over the coal sequence as a whole, conditions evolved from exclusively terrestrial through mixed terrestrial and subaquatic to open water. Also detected were multiple rapid reversals of the water table, especially higher in the sequence, and cyclic patterns reflecting a brief basal subaquatic phase prior to the onset of sustained terrestrial conditions. These patterns suggest a fluctuating, although progressively rising, water table and a balance between accommodation and accumulation. Thesis (Ph. D.)

30|$|The lignite samples {{collected}} from Giral lignite field of Barmer basin {{have been subjected}} to petrological investigation. The data generated has been discussed to understand the evolution of the paleomires of these lignites. The present study reveals that these low rank C coals are chiefly composed of huminite group macerals, mainly telohuminite and detrohuminite, while liptinite and inertinite group macerals occur in subordinate amounts. Not much variation in the maceral composition from Seam-I to Seam-VIII has been observed. Barmer lignites are characterized by a very high GI (> 10) and moderate TPI indicating <b>topogenous</b> mire in the basin which was permanently flooded. The GI and TPI values and the petrography-based facies critical models indicate that these lignites originated mostly under wet forest swamp to clastic marsh having telmatic to limno-telmatic conditions with a moderate rate of subsidence and a very slow fall in ground water table. Further, the GWI and VI values are suggestive of mesotrophic to rheotrophic hydrological conditions having the dominance of herbaceous to marginal aquatic vegetation. There were spells of periodic drowning of peat especially during the formation of Seam-VII. Moderately high concentration of calcium in these lignites along with the presence of framboidal pyrite indicate enhanced sulphate-reducing bacterial activity present in carbonate and sulphate-rich waters in the basin during peat formation.|$|E
40|$|Upland swamps are {{a form of}} <b>topogenous</b> mire {{that occur}} on the plateau areas of eastern Australia. These systems are well {{recognized}} for their ecological value, but {{little is known about}} their internal hydrological function and how this relates to their geomorphic structure and evolution. In this study, the geomorphic, sedimentological, and hydrological properties of an intact upland swamp on the Budderoo Plateau NSW are investigated. The geomorphic structure of the swamp is simple, and the sedimentology comprises basal layers of coarse sands, overlain by several layers of organic accumulation up to 3. 3 m in thickness. Each of these sedimentary units has different hydrological behaviors (rates of water throughflow and discharge) that drive the overall function of the swamp in response to rainfall of various magnitudes and duration. Four hydrological response types have been identified in the functioning of this swamp. These response types (RT) are characterized by different peaks and recession responses to rainfall. The form of the hydrograph produced is controlled by antecedent water table position and the amount, timing and duration of rainfall. Depending on antecedent moisture conditions, the swamp can operate either as a store for water or as a rapid conduit for water throughflow and overland flow. 22 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{stratigraphy}} of Holocene peat deposits from {{an interior}} lowland basin of tropical Peninsular Malaysia provides {{insight into the}} hydrological, ecological, and climatic controls on tropical peatland development. Interpretations about vegetation and climate dynamics (including storm intensity) over the past 5000 years are integrated with regional and global climatic and eustatic changes {{to serve as a}} proxy for past ecology and climate. Tasek Bera Basin (TBB) is a lowland dendritic basin in tropical Peninsular Malaysia. Accumulation of organic matter occurred in local lakes during the last glacial maximum (LGM), but widespread peat deposition did not start until 5300 BP when climatic changes led to the evolution of a wetland system. Peat accumulation progressively expanded with terrestrialisation of channels and subbasins to paludification of the riparian part of the lowland forest zone. Lithofacies can be distinguished despite the highly diverse peat and organic-rich sediment composition {{as a result of the}} climatic and hydrologic changes over the past 5300 years. Peat accumulation rates, ranging from 0. 7 to 2. 5 mm/year, are highest in Pandanaceae environments and lowest in high-ash swamp forests and environments dominated by Cyperaceae. Transects of peat cores across the mire system show the stratigraphic complexities of the peat is the result of hydrological variations and, thus, plant successional changes. Ash-yield shows that periods of high mineral matter input into the drainage system occurred since the mid-Holocene, indicating rapid and cyclic changes in frequency and magnitude of runoff events and, by inference, storms. Stratigraphic analysis of peat and ash-yield are tools that provide a proxy for development of Holocene hydrologic events in <b>topogenous</b> peat deposits...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{an attempt to}} detect, define and characterise, {{on the basis of}} their floristic composition, the principal types of rich fen vegetation in lowland England and Wales. Some 1, 000 samples were taken from a wide variety of rich fen systems throughout England and Wales and from one area in S. Scotland, by a subjective procedure based upon stand selection. A computer-based system was developed to handle these data combining both numerical and traditional (Zurich-Montpellier) methods of analysis. The dataware processed by normal and inverse Information Analysis in. conjunction with a computer-assisted hand-sorting routine leading to the production of structured species-sample tables. One hundred and eight noda were identified and described and compared with related units recognised from Britain and N. W. Europe. Sixty eight were arranged into 11 Associations of which 4 represent new syntaxa. The remainder were placed into sociations or left as noda of uncertain status. The communities were all classified into higher syntaxa essentially following the scheme advocated by WESTHOFF & DEN HELD (1969).

40|$|Temperate Highland Peat Swamps on Sandstone (THPSS) are {{a form of}} <b>topogenous</b> mire {{found on}} the plateau areas of eastern Australia. They are well {{recognised}} for their ecological value, but our understanding of their geomorphic structure, function and evolution remains limited. Across 19 sites, the valley fills of THPSS comprise sequences of mineral-rich sand and loam deposits. Basal sand and gravel sediments have low organic content and low carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratios (a measure of peat formation) and are dated between 15. 3 and 9 kyr cal. BP, with outliers back to 44 kyr cal. BP. These units reflect mineral-sediment trapping and accumulation on the valley floor. The transition to 'swamp' conditions through paludification occurred between 15. 2 and 10. 3 kyr cal. BP in some systems, and between 7. 6 and 1. 4 kyr cal. BP in other, adjacent valleys. These 'swamp' sediments comprise a package of units, progressing upward from fine cohesive sands, through assemblages of alternating organic sands to surface organic fines. These beds vary in texture from loams to sands and {{have a range of}} organic matter content (from 7. 6 % to 79. 9 %) and C:N ratios (from 15 to 58). The surface organic fines at 0 and 100 cm depth range in age from 13. 1 to 0. 7 kyr cal. BP. The composition and age structure of the valley fill suggest a mix of allogenic and autogenic controls are responsible for the formation of these swamps, but a regional model of THPSS evolution is emerging. Given these 'peatlands' have formed under a climate that experiences significant inter-annual variability in rainfall, conditions for peat formation are localised and not directly equivalent to those documented internationally. 12 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{contribution}} of lignite {{to the total}} electric power output of Greece exceeds 75 %. Most greek lignite deposits {{are located in the}} Florina-Ptolemais- Kozani basin, a large intensively exploited area, in northern Greece. This area is exploited by opencast mining and feeds nearby lignite-fired power stations. The elongated intermontaine Florina-Ptolemais-Kozani basin is a NNW-SSE trending graben system, that extends over a distance of 250 km from Bitola, in the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia to Servia, southeast of Kozani, Greece. The basement consists of metamorphic schists in the west and crystalline limestone in the east. The Amynteo basin is part of this graben, that opened in the late Miocene and was divided into sub-basins in the Pleistocene, and consists of rythmic alternations of lignite beds and lacustrine and fluvial sediments. Sampling represents the vertical and lateral differentiation of lignite beds in Amynteo field (Chapter 1). Coal petrological investigation along with proximate and elemental analyses were undertaken (Chapter 2) {{in order to determine the}} petrographic characteristics of the Amynteo lignites and their depositional environment. Thirty-eight samples (representing different lignite beds of the Amynteo deposit) were collected from a borehole. The Amynteo lignites have an euulminite B reflectance of Rr= 0. 21 %, and in terms of lithotype belong to matrix soft brown coals. Huminite is the most abundant maceral group, and consists mostly of humodetrinite. Inertinite has relatively low percentages whereas liptinite concentrations are rather high. Ternary plots and facies indices were employed in order to reconstruct the palaeoenvironment. The depositional environment of the Amynteo-Apofysis lignites is not definitely ascribed to a forest swamp or a reed marsh environment. The high ash content of the analysed samples is a clear indication of a <b>topogenous</b> setting. Low TPI and high GI values are observed. High alkalinity and strongly reducing conditions may be inferred from the presence of syngenetic (framboidal) pyrite, the low TPI values which indicate high bacterial activity, and thus high pH conditions, and the preservation of gastropod shells and chlorophyllinite. High GI values indicates a constant influx of calcium rich waters into the coal swamp. The Apofysis lignite deposit may be interpreted to be autochthonous to hypoautochthonous. The peat accumulation was governed by a high groundwater level (wet telmatic to limno-telmatic facies) and a moderate subsidence rate. The high liptinite content of the samples makes them suitable for liquefaction and gasification and may also be useful in chemical industry due to the high extract yields. ...|$|E
40|$|A Pliocene lignite seam up to 160 m thick {{occurs in}} the Velenje basin (Slovenia). The seam {{originated}} in a <b>topogenous</b> mire and evolved within a non-marine, transgressive setting. Differences in soluble organic matter yield and hydrocarbon content of borehole samples from the lignite are related to differences {{in the composition of}} free lipids of microbial origin and/or hydrocarbons derived from the biogeochemical degradation of plant tissue. Variations of the redox conditions within the mire are reflected by pristane/phytane ratios. The abundance of terpenoid biomarkers indicates the predominance of gymnosperms over angiosperms, which is consistent with palynomorphic spectra dominated by pollen of the Sequoia-Taxodium-Metasequoia plant community rather than by angiosperms. Evidence is also provided that the content of land plant derived biomarkers and the preservation of plant tissue is controlled by the input of resin-rich, decay-resistant conifers. Sections of the seam characterized by a high degree of gelification of humotelinite (gelification index) show high contents of hop- 17 (21) -ene but low hopane concentrations. The results suggest that the gelification of plant tissue may be governed by the activity of anaerobic rather than aerobic bacteria. Despite the minor variation in the proportions of gymnosperms versus angiosperms in the peat-forming vegetation, a general influence of the floral assemblage on carbon isotopic composition of the coals (delta(13) C - 25. 3 to - 27. 0 parts per thousand) is proposed. Carbon cycling during biogeochemical decomposition of plant tissue by bacteria is assumed to affect the delta(13) C value of the lignite. Petrographic and geochemical data of gelified and ungelified fossil wood provide evidence that gelification may be governed by microorganisms (e. g. anaerobic bacteria) different from those responsible for decreasing cellulose contents during early diagenetic, aerobic degradation of wood. Based on the molecular composition of terpenoid biomarkers, the wood fragments are identified as derived from gymnosperms. The relative proportions of saturated versus aromatic hydrocarbon fractions of fossil gymnosperms display a general tendency towards lower values in gelified wood remains. This indicates that bacteria involved in gelification of plant tissue may also be involved in aromatisation of diterpenoid hydrocarbons. The chemotaxonomical classification of the macrofossils as gymnosperms is corroborated by the mean carbon isotopic compositions of the macrofossils (delta(13) C = - 24. 5 parts per thousand) and the extracted cellulose (delta(13) C = - 22. 0 parts per thousand). The higher isotopic difference of about 2. 5 %. between cellulose and fossil wood, compared to that found in modern trees, can most probably be explained by the smaller effect of C- 13 discrimination for cellulose when compared with wood during decomposition [Chem. Geol. 158 (1999) 121]. Compared with the coals, the delta(13) C values of wood and extracted cellulose are affected to a minor extent by microbial activity. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Samples {{from two}} lignite seams (Lower Seam, Upper Seam) of the Lavanttal basin (Austria) and {{additional}} xylite were investigated for variations in maceral composition, petrography-based facies indicators, bulk geochemical parameters, and molecular composition of hydrocarbons. Both seams originated in a <b>topogenous</b> mire and evolved within a transgressive setting. The final drowning of the mire {{is indicated by}} sapropelic shales. Whereas the sapropelic shale overlying the Lower Seam was deposited in a freshwater lake, the sapropelic shale above the Upper Seam represents a brackish lake. Numerous relationships are found between petrography-based facies indicators and the geochemical composition of organic matter. The contents of macerals of the liptinite group are positively correlated with soluble organic matter (SOM) yields and hydrogen index (HI). Consistent with maceral composition and high HI values, enhanced proportions of short-chain n-alkanes, which are predominantly found in algae and microorganisms, are obtained from samples of the sapropelic shales. The final drowning of the mire is reflected by decreasing pristane/phytane ratios, due to the rise in (ground) water table {{and the establishment of}} anaerobic conditions, as well as by decreasing ratios of diasterenes/sterenes, indicating increasing pH values in the mire. The degree of gelification of plant tissue (gelification index) is governed by the microbial activity in the mire, as indicated by the hopanes concentration. The differences in floral assemblage during the formation of the Lavanttal lignite seams are reflected by major differences in tissue preservation. Preservation of plant tissue (TPI) in the Lavanttal lignite is obviously controlled by the presence/absence of decay-resistant gymnosperms in the peat-forming vegetation, and additionally influenced by the relative contribution of wood to coal formation. The results provide evidence that valuable information for coal facies characterization could be obtained by petrography-based and geochemical facies indicators. An influence of the floral assemblage (gymnosperms/angiosperms ratio) and of the contribution of algal biomass on carbon isotopic composition of the organic matter (delta C- 13 = - 24. 2 to - 28. 6 %.) is proposed. Carbon cycling during biogeochemical decomposition of plant tissue by bacteria is suggested to affect the delta C- 13 values of the coal, The chemotaxonomical classification of the xylites as gymnosperm remnants, based on the molecular composition of terpenoid biomarkers, is corroborated by the carbon isotopic composition of the xylites (mean delta C- 13 = - 24. 1 %) and the extracted cellulose (mean delta C- 13 = - 20. 2 %). The higher isotopic difference of about 3. 9 %. between cellulose and total organic carbon of the xylites, compared to the difference between cellulose and wood found in modem trees, is explained by the smaller effect of decomposition on delta C- 13 of cellulose.

Summary and conclusionsUpland swamps are a form of <b>topogenous</b> mire which occur on the plateaux areas of southeastern Australia. These systems are well recognised for their ecological value and their functional role in the hydrodynamics of the catchments in which they occur. However, {{little is known about}} the internal hydrological functioning of upland swamps and how this relates to their geomorphic structure and evolution. Upland swamps are currently vulnerable to widespread and ongoing degradation as a result of landuse change, longwall mining, dewatering, peat mining and urbanisation. With this in mind, the aims of this study are to supplement the current knowledge on the geomorphic evolution and physical characteristics of upland swamps of Eastern Australia, and to provide baseline data on their internal hydrological functioning. The sedimentological, geomorphic, hydraulic and hydrological properties of an intact upland swamp on the Budderoo Plateau NSW are investigated. The geomorphic structure of the swamp is simple, and is comprised of four distinct geomorphic zones: the central swamp, the headwater marginal swamp, the valley marginal swamp, and the hillslope zones. The results of this study indicate that the development of the swamp was uniform and consisted of a sequence of mineral deposition (up to 1 m thick overlying bedrock) followed by a subsequent phase of organic accumulation up to 3. 3 m thick. The organic accumulation has produced a layer of upper fibric organic fines and lower sapric organic fines. Each of these sedimentary units has different hydrological behaviours (rates of water transfer and discharge) that drive the overall function of the swamp in response to rainfall of various magnitudes and duration. Three hydrological response regimes have been identified in the functioning of this swamp. These regimes are characterised by different peak and recession responses to rainfall. The form of the hydrograph produced is controlled by antecedent water table position (i. e. which sedimentary layers are saturated) and the amount, timing and duration of rainfall. Depending on antecedent moisture conditions, the swamp can be operating either as a store for water or as a rapid conduit for water throughflow and overland flow. It therefore has a dual function in terms of flow generation in response to rainfall. These findings are consistent with those established within the Australian literature on upland swamps and within the broader international peatland literature.

40|$|Organic {{petrography}} {{and organic}} geochemistry {{studies have been}} conducted on Tertiary age coals from Tanjung Enim, South Sumatra Basin, Indonesia. The coals are of subbituminous rank (vitrinite/huminite reflectance, VRr, = 0. 35 - 0. 46 %). In this area, the coals were also locally intruded by andesitic sills. The thermally metamorphosed coals are of medium-volatile bituminous to meta-anthracite rank (high vitrinite reflectance, VRr up to 5. 18 %). The studied low rank coals are dominated by huminite. Less abundant are liptinite and inertinite. Minerals are found only in small amounts; mostly as iron sulfide. The high rank coals are dominated by thermally altered vitrinite. Mosaic structures can be recognized as groundmass and crack fillings. The most common minerals found are carbonates, pyrite or marcasite and clay minerals. The latter consist of kaolinite in low rank coal and illite and rectorite in high rank coal. Based on maceral assemblages, the low rank coals can be grouped into five classes: (1) humotelinite-rich group, (2) humodetrinite-rich group, (3) humocollinite-rich group, (4) inertinite-rich group and (5) humodetrinite-liptinite-rich group. The basal section of the studied coal seams is represented by the humodetrinite-liptinite-rich group. The middle section of the seams is characterized by humotelinite-rich and humocollinite-rich groups. The top section of the coal seams is typically represented by the humodetrinite-rich or inertinite-rich group. The sequence of maceral assemblages thus represents the change of <b>topogenous</b> to ombrogenous peat {{and the development of a}} raised peat bog. The coalification path of each maceral shows that vitrinite, liptinite and inertinite reflectance converge in a transition zone at VRmax of around 1. 5 %. Significant decrease of volatile matter occurs in the zone between 0. 5 - 2. 0 % VRmax. A sharp bend occurs at VRmax between 2. 0 % and 2. 5 %. Above 2. 5 %, the volatile matter decreases only very slightly. Between VRr = 0. 5 % and 2. 0 %, the carbon content of the coals is ascending drastically. Above 2. 5 % VRr, the carbon content becomes relatively stable (around 95 wt. %, daf). Using Rock-Eval pyrolysis, it is known that the Oxygen Index values are low (< 5 mg CO 2 /g TOC) and the high rank coals have a lower Hydrogen Index (< 130 mg HC/g TOC) than the low rank coals (~ 300 mg HC/g TOC). The Tmax increases with maturity (420 - 440 ºC for low rank coals and 475 - 551 ºC for high rank coals). Based on some petrographical and chemical properties, it was calculated that the temperature of contact metamorphism reached 700 - 750 ºC in the most metamorphosed coal. GC/GC-MS analysis indicates that the n-alkane distribution as well as the relative amount of phytane and pristane correlate with the organic facies of the studied coals and their maturity. Some identified terpenoid biomarkers, most of all cadinane- and eudesmane-type sesquiterpenoids and oleanane- and ursane-type triterpenoids, indicate the predominance of angiosperm plants in the paleomire. Reversals in the trends of molecular maturity parameters based on aliphatic hydrocarbons (n-alkane distribution and pristane/phytane ratio) and aromatic hydrocarbons (methylphenanthrene) with coal rank are observed. This trend is also reflected by the ratio of aromatic C-H to aliphatic C-H absorbances of coals based on FTIR analysis...|$|E
40|$|In the Trbovlje region (Slovenia), {{an upper}} Oligocene coal seam up to 30 in thick {{developed}} in a <b>topogenous</b> mire and evolved within a transgressive setting. The lower ash-rich part of the seam (unit I) accumulated in a forest swamp strongly influenced by fluvial activity. Palynomorph spectra are dominated by Taxodiaceae-Cupressaceae pollen. Ash yields decrease in the middle (unit II) and {{upper part of the}} seam (unit III), indicating decreasing fluvial activity. An increase in CaO contents reflects increasing amounts of inflowing water from an alkaline take, which progressively controlled peat hydrology in units II and III. High sulfur contents in the nonmarine coal are a result of the carbonate-rich water. Abundant pollen and spores from Myricaceae and Polypodiaceae indicate that unit II represents a bush moor. During deposition of unit III, this environment was replaced by a reed moor. Sapropelic coal (unit IV) and sapropelic shale (unit V) accumulated in a relatively large lake, which was established by another water table rise. The interpreted environmental changes are confirmed by biomarker data. Pristane/phytane ratios reflect variations of the redox conditions within the mire and reach a minimum in the sapropelic unit IV. The abundances of gymnosperm- and angiosperm-derived terpenoid hydrocarbons testify the predominance of gymnosperms over angiospenns during early peat stages (unit I), and increasing proportions of angiosperms during deposition of units II and III. Highest contents of diterpenoids coincide with maxima in the preservation of plant tissue (TPI) within unit I (wet forest swamp), suggesting that TPI is partly controlled by the input of resin-rich, decay-resistant conifers. Sections of the seam characterized by advanced gelification show low steroids/hopanoids ratios. The results imply that gelification of plant tissue is related to increased microbial activity. Evidence is provided that the hopanes {{could be used as a}} measure for the activity of aerobic bacteria, whereas for the hop- 17 (21) -ene a microbial origin from anaerobic (iron-reducing) bacteria is assumed. A general influence of the floral assemblage and of varying contributions of algal biomass on carbon isotopic composition of the organic matter (delta(13) C = - 24. 0 to - 28. 1 parts per thousand) is proposed. Carbon cycling during biogeochemical decomposition of plant tissue by bacteria is assumed to affect the delta(13) C values of the coal. Fossil wood collected from the seam is identified as derived from gymnosperms, based on the molecular composition of terpenoid hydrocarbons. This chemotaxonomical classification is corroborated by the mean carbon isotopic compositions of the fossil wood (delta(13) C = - 24. 0 parts per thousand) and by the delta(13) C value (- 21. 8 parts per thousand) of the extracted cellulose from one macrofossil. The low cellulose content of the sample (2. 7 %) together with the slightly higher isotopic difference of 1. 6 parts per thousand between cellulose and fossil wood, compared to that found in modem trees, can most probably be explained by the possible reversal in C- 13 discrimination for cellulose when compared with wood in highly degraded samples.

40|$|The idea of {{the present}} thesis was to combine {{different}} established methods in a high-resolution study on a short-timed interval of Duckmantian strata (Pennsylvanian/Upper Carboniferous) of the Ruhr Basin, Western Germany. Organic petrographical, palynological, sedimentological and organic geochemical techniques were used to obtain a huge data set, to support the argumentations and discussions. In doing so, these investigations were focused on two main goals: (a) the maturity and quality of source rocks and (b) the evolution of swamp environments. (a) Maturity and quality of source rocksThis {{first part of the}} study focuses on the quality, quantity and maturity of coal and dispersed terrigenous organic matter. Furthermore, kerogen concentrates and coal-mineral-mixtures also were analysed. For the sampled interval samples show a vitrinite reflectance between 0. 75 and 1. 0 % with an increase of maturity towards the stratigraphic older and deeper seam successions. Average vitrinite reflectance of sediment samples is slightly higher than that of coal samples. The maturity trend also is reflected in the Tmax values of Rock-Eval pyrolysis or the C 17 /C 27 -relationship. Investigations on petroleum potential show a kerogen type III respectively II/III for the sampled interval. Differences between Rock-Eval parameters determined on whole rock samples and kerogen concentrates were observed, especially with respect to Hydrogen Index (HI) values. In coals, which were compared with dispersed organic matter of similar maceral composition, the HI is about two times as high as that of the sediment samples. In contrast, Oxygen Indices are much higher for dispersed type III kerogen than for coal, caused by the stronger degradation of organic compounds in the clastic environments as compared to the peat environments. However, Oxygen Indices clearly are influenced by decomposition of carbonate minerals. Furthermore, Hydrogen Indices of dispersed kerogen are influenced by mineral-matrix effects. Experiments with artificial mixtures of coal and minerals show that reactions with pyrite seem to reduce HI values of kerogen concentrates significantly. (b) Evolution of swamp environmentsThe second part of the thesis focuses on palynological investigations on miospores to reconstruct the swamp evolution during the Duckmantian of the Ruhr Basin. In addition, sedimentological and organic petrographical data confirmed the interpretation. Based on published information of in situ spores the encountered miospores were assigned to their parent plants in order to reconstruct the vegetation history. In this study six plant associations were identified by using a Detrended Correspondence Analyses (DCA) : lepidocarpacean association I, lepidocarpacean association II, lepidocarpacean – sigillarian association, lepidocarpacean – sphenophyll association, lepidocarpacean – fern association, and the subarborescent lycopsid association. Furthermore, coal petrographical GI/TPI and GWI/VI relationships also reflect these associations. Another new defined index, the water cover index (WCI), based on these palynological interpretations, reflects the ratio of hydrophilous/hygrophilous vs. mesophilous plants and gives additional information on the environment. In the sampled seam successions arborescent lycopsids are the most abundant plants, with a dominance of the miospore Lycospora. In 75 % of all samples the genus is represented with more than 50 % relative abundance. Hence, lepidocarpaceans such as Lepidophloios and Lepidodendron dominated the vegetation of the Ruhr Basin during the mid and late Duckmantian, forming flood plains and planar forest mires. Some variations are reflected in abundance of other spores. A greater influence of the sigillarian miospores Crassispora was typical for drier swamp margins, whereas densospore producing plants or sphenophylls characterized the stunted respectively scrambling vegetation of domed swamps. By contrast, fern influenced environments were rare during the Duckmantian. Recurring rhythmic successions of plant associations and depositional environments were noted in the studied interval: A lower flood plain is followed by peat substrate <b>topogenous</b> mires, which rise up and build an ombrogenous mire. After subsidence and recurrent flooding an upper flood plain was re-established. This general cycle is temporarily interrupted by other plant associations representing varying local environments. Drier sandbanks and swamp margin zones covered with sigillarians regularly occurred, implicating small environmental variations and a lateral shift of the swamp habitat...|$|E
40|$|As an {{introduction}} {{to a number of}} researches of his own the author wishes to give the following data: „Veen” has two meanings in Dutch: 1. in a petrographic sense (peat) Von Büllow’s definition was accepted: „Torf” ist zu deflnieren als ein meist dunkles, kohlenstoffreiches und ± saures Gemenge unvollständig spezifisch-zersetzter Pflanzenteile, das erdgeschichtlich jüngste Glied der Verwantschaftsreihe der Kohlen, dessen Bildung noch heute andauert. ” 2. in a plant-sociological-geographic sense (bog) the following definition has been suggested: a bog is a plot, the surface of which consists of a layer of peat, either covered or not with vegetation, with which that layer is genetically connected. The classification of bogs according to their position with regard to the water-level of the surroundings (Staring) and that of the geological chart were rejected on account of their ambiguous character. The classification suggested by Van Baren according to the environment in which the bogs have been formed, was likewise thought insufficient. Preference was given to the classification according to the plants which gave rise to the peat (eutrophic, mesotrophic and oligotrophic bogs) and according to the origin of the water needed for peat formation (<b>topogenous,</b> ombrogenous and soligenous bogs). The conditions of peat-formation are of a botanical (presence of a vegetation and micro-organisms), climatologic (presence of a certain temperature and moisture) and geological nature (presence of a basin, valley or dead river-branch, certain level of ground water, a possible impervious layer). With reference to a number of authors (Picardt; Van Lier; Grisebach, Venema and Staring; Weber) the alteration in conception as to peatformation from the 17 th via the 18 th and 19 th to the 20 th century has been given. The word „Peel” cannot be derived from „palus”. Nothing is certain about its origin. It may mean the low land, bog or marsh. The bogs of the Peel lie on the Brabant-Limburg border-plateau (fig. 2). Lorié and Pannekoek van Rheden have shown that the peatformation of the Peel is likely to have occurred in channels, which have been formed by the Meuse, in co-operation with wind and rain (fig. 4). The bogs were therefore in the first instance <b>topogenous</b> formations, which afterwards developed into ombrogenous bogs. For his own research the author collected peat in three ways: 1. by cutting lumps of peat from open profiles; 2. by boring with a simple peat-bore (photograph 1); 3. by boring with the Utrecht peat-bore, an improvement on Dachnowski’s (fig. 5). To assist in the pollen-analytic examination the samples were treated according to Erdtman’s method. The latter has the following advantages compared with the usual treatment with a 10 % KOH-solution: 1. the surface-structures of the pollen-grains are more distinct and as a result the grains themselves can be recognized better; 2. the pollen is more concentrated, so that in spite of the method taking up much time, a saving of time is possible. How the method is applied may be found in the chapter concerned (p. 38 and following). For the stratigraphic examination the samples were broken apart in a glass-bowl of water and viewed with a binocular microscope. Dry sandy samples were broken in water, when seeds and other vegetative parts came floating to the top; next they were put with a brush on thick blotting paper and studied through the binocular microscope. The designations for the sediments and species of peat have been derived from Fægri & Gams. For Scheuchzeria peat a new designation has been added. A plea was made for replacing the word pollen-analysis by „palynology”. A survey of the observations and examinations up to abt. 1935 closes the introduction (see the diagrams of Weber, Erdtman and Duyfjes in the figs. 6, 7, 8 and 9). The author’s own research refers to the Southern and Astense Peel, as in the remaining grounds of the geological chart indicated I 4 v (= raised bog) no samples could be taken owing to the digging off having progressed too far. 10 profiles were examined. The situation of the bore-sites has been given in the geological chart of the grounds (fig. 3). The result of the examination (figs. 10 — 27) and the discussion on it may be summerized as follows: Zoning of pollen-diagrams The sub-zoning of the late- and post-glacial periods according to Blytt & Sernander has proved useful as a zoning of pollen-diagrams, provided atlantic and sub-boreal are joined. It is desirable to replace Blytt & Sernander’s terminology by a different one, because the authors gave a climatologic connotation to their names of periods. The limit between pleistocene and holocene was drawn between preboreal and boreal as Florschütz did. As phases of the holocene the following names were suggested: young post-glacial = sub-atlantic mid post-glacial = sub-boreal and atlantic old post-glacial = boreal. Neither in the Peel nor elsewhere in Holland have Allerød-deposits been found. They {{are not likely to be}} found either, as on account of the long distance from the land-ice-margin the flora will have been hardly or not at all influenced by the Allerød interstadial period. For Holland therefore the zoning of the late-glacial according to Firbas (1935) may be considered sufficient. The names of the periods do not bear a climatologic connotation as those of the post-glacial phases do. For the sake of a unity the following names have been suggested: young late-glacial = pre-boreal mid late-glacial = sub-arctic period old late-glacial = arctic period. Forest-history In a table (p. 98), in which likewise the Peel diagrams of Weber, Erdtman and Duyfjes have been inserted, the examined profiles have been arranged from North to South. From each profile it has been stated whether it originated in a certain period (+) or not (—). The sub-arctic phase was characterized by forests of Betula and Pinus and was followed by the pre-boreal phase, in which Corylus and Alnus occurred. Also from the other Dutch diagrams (see list on p. 99) it appeared that in the Netherlands the Alnus pollen occurs with an equal frequency before, during and after that of the Quercetum mixtum. The old post-glacial zone of the diagrams shows a peak in the Pinusline. In contrast with the from Mid-Europe there is not always a maximum in the Corylus-curve after the Pinus-peak. In other Dutch diagrams this phenomenon is likewise found. Only in 28 % of all Dutch profiles with a boreal zone does a hazel-maximum succeed a Pinus one. They often co-incide (16 %), while in the remaining cases no hazelpeak has been established. There is no fixed order of sequence in the occurrence of the components of the Quercetum mixtum, either in the Peel or elsewhere in Holland. The mid post-glacial is the phase of culmination of warmth-loving forest elements: Alnus pollen shows the highest percentage in this zone. Quercus pollen also occurs in great quantities, while Ulmus and Tilia take up an important place up to the „Grenzhorizont”. The absolute and empiric Fagus pollen limits are found at different heights in the mid post-glacial zone of the diagrams, the rational limit lies somewhere near the „Grenzhorizont”. In the young post-glacial phase the Fagus pollen attains fairly high percentages (up to 30 %). The maxima in the East and South-east of the Netherlands are between 20 % and 38 %; they decrease towards the coast and increase towards the South-east (Hautes Fagnes, Belgium) and East (Germany). It seems incorrect to class the Netherlands almost entirely among the oak-alderterritory poor in beeches, as Firbas did. An attempt has been made to fit the Peel-diagrams into Overbeck & Schneider’s zonation system. For the territory for which it has been made there are already difficulties (p. 104), for use in the Peel and other Dutch diagrams there are even more objections (p. 68, 104). Godwin’s zonation system appeared to be a little less forced, but not quite useful on account of too many details. From his horizons that of Ulmus proved useless for the continent. Neither for the Peel nor for the Netherlands and its surrounding territory can a detailed zonation system be designed. It has proved difficult to proceed any farther than Rudolph’s „Grundsukzession”: birch, pine-hazel-mixed oak-forest-beech, in which the alder generally joins the mixed oak-forest and the hornbeam the beech. Before drawing far-reaching conclusions from the course of the curves (as has been done by some authors) more palynological researches are needed in accordance with the actuality principle, known from geology. Pollen-grains from warmth-loving trees in seemingly sub-arctic spectra In profile 4 (Deurnse Peel II) pollen-grains of Abies, Alnus, Picea, Tilia, Ulmus and Corylus were found in the „late-glacial” zone (figs. 14, 15). Investigations were made as to which of the following possibilities would be the cause of their appearance: 1. in taking and preparing the samples pollution occurred; 2. pollen-transport over long distances has taken place; 3. the pollen-grains found have got secondarily into the deposit; 4. warmth-loving trees have occurred in favourable circumstances in the late-glacial phase or 5. in an interstadial period or in an interglacial phase. The said pollen-grains probably hail from a Würm interstadial or interglacial phase. Interglacial peat On the site of the bore-point 7 it was possible to collect samples from the layers under the peat. The upper 40 cm of the diagram Griendtsveen IX (fig. 27) of this profile proved a repetition of the lower 40 cm of the Griendtsveen I profile (fig. 18). The diagram shows that pollen of Carpinus, Picea and Abies occurs showing the deposit to be of interglacial age. The pollen-curves, however, pass unnoticed from an interglacial into a post-glacial portion. The limit is likely to be found between the two, about 30 cm below the mowing field. There is therefore a great stratigraphic hiatus. Pollen-analytically it could not be decided from which interglacial period the profile hails; on account of its situation on the middle terrace, it was deemed likely that it was an Eem sea deposit. The examined profile probably corresponds to Jessen & Milthers’ zone g; showing it to have been formed at the end of the Eem sea period. The Meuse therefore cannot have flowed through this part of the Astense Peel after the mid Eemean phase. Stratigraphy This is difficult to summarize. Compare various profiles. Individual mention may be made here of: 1. peat on a podsol layer; this was found in two places (Deurnse Peel I Kraaienhut and Griendtsveen VIII). Peat-formation may be thought to have occurred in the following way: heather started growing on drift-sand giving rise to a podsol layer. As the latter is impervious the vegetation surface became marshy. The heath was replaced by a Caricetum from which peat arose. Gradually more Eriophorum occurred, from which almost pure vaginatum peat arose. The bog-surface grew moister and moister, Sphagnum cuspidatum and Scheuchzeria could grow on it and formed a „Vorlaufstorf”. Only then could non-extremehydrophile Sphagna join in peat-formation. 2. the occurrence of Scheuchzeria-peat after the „Grenzhorizont” period. This species of peat, which is often found at the basis of the old Sphagnum-peat as a mesotrophic transition vegetation, has for the Netherlands only been found in the young post-glacial phase in the Peel (Deurnse Peel I Kraaienhut, Griendtsveen V and VIII and Nederweerd). At present the plant is very rare. The severe decline of this plant was also observed elsewhere. Probably it is caused by the gradual drying up or reclaiming of the raised bogs. Of the present station of Scheuchzeria near Ommen a short description has been given (p. 59 and photographs 2, 3, 4). 3. the „Grenzhorizont”. Where the young Sphagnum-peat has not been dug for the preparation of moss-litter, the Peel bogs show a clear „Grenzhorizont” (photograph 8). The conceptions about its origin have been discussed. The distinct separation between the old and the young Sphagnum-peat was not considered sufficiently explained. Though on the whole the „Grenzhorizont” is synchronous in the North-west European profiles, the point of transition from old to young Sphagnumpeat was fairly unstable and easily changeable as to time. Generally the date of the „Grenzhorizont” is fixed at about 500 A. D., though there are differences in opinion. There is a lack of archeological correlation which renders a correct dating impossible. Interference of man in the Peel Three ways of interference were stated: 1. peat has been dug off for the greater part in the territory of the Peel: young Sphagnum-peat for the preparation of moss-litter, old Sphagnum-peat for fuel. The trees which appeared when the bog was dug up in the „Veenderij der Maatschappij Griendtsveen” are sometimes in so good a condition, that they are used for building sheds. The 1 st, 2 nd and 4 th beam in the foreground of the shed in photo 5 has been sawn from a 30 m long subfossil pine. 2. in a native peat-digging it was possible to collect recent young Sphagnum-peat. 40 to 50 years ago the peasants living there had dug peat in holes, which were afterwards left to themselves. Sphagnum started growing again and the holes were filled in again. The diagram (fig. Griendtsveen VII) represents the surrounding heath with scattered pines and birches, sown by the wind, and a pine-plantation close by. 3. in the profiles Nieuwe Peel, Griendtsveen VI and VII it has been fixed by the indications given by Firbas, that only in the surface layers of the bog has corn-pollen occurred. So in these parts cultivation of cereals will be of recent date. This also appeared from the history of the reclamation of the said territory...|$|E
