40|$|Abstract We studied {{correlation}} between crown conditions and tree-ring widths in 260 trees of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) growing on 33 sites in southern Sweden. The tree-ring increment over 1998 – 2002 was highest in <b>trees</b> <b>with</b> healthy crowns, intermediate in <b>trees</b> <b>with</b> moderately de-clined crowns, and lowest in <b>trees</b> <b>with</b> heavily declining crowns. The time period with significant {{correlation between}} crown status and tree-ring incre-ment varied between 10 years (given autocorrelation in tree-ring chronologies preserved) and 4 years (auto-correlation removed). In pairwise comparisons of three crown classes, differences in tree-ring increment be-tween <b>trees</b> <b>with</b> healthy crowns and <b>trees</b> <b>with</b> heavily declining crowns were the most pronounced, Fisher LSD P value staying below 0. 05 over 13 years (autocorrelation preserved) or 4 years (autocorrelation removed). Over two 5 -year periods (1993 – 1997 vs. 1998 – 2002) the cumulative increment increased sig-nificantly for <b>trees</b> <b>with</b> healthy crowns, did not change in <b>trees</b> <b>with</b> moderately declining crowns, and significantly decreased in <b>trees</b> <b>with</b> heavily declining crowns. For <b>trees</b> <b>with</b> healthy crowns, this dynamics may represent growth recovery after 1992 drought. Instead, oaks with defoliation above 60 % appear to reach a threshold {{in their ability to}} recover growth. At sites on nutrient-poor soils cumulative increments over 1998 – 2002 differed significantly among <b>trees</b> <b>with</b> different crown condition and no differences were observed at sites on nutrient-rich soils. Analyses and interpretation of the oak growth trends as recovered from tree-ring chronologies may be improved by controlling for the crown status of the trees sampled, e. g., by using sampling strategy that would represent the average crown and growth conditions of the sites...|$|R

5|$|Fertilised female wasps {{enter the}} {{receptive}} 'fig' (the syconium) through a tiny {{hole at the}} crown (the ostiole). They crawl around the inflorescenced interior of the fig, pollinating some of the female flowers, before laying eggs inside some of the flowers and dying. After several weeks' development in their galls, the male wasps emerge before the females. They chew holes in the galls containing females and fertilise them through the hole they have just chewed. Males return later to mated females, and enlarge the mating holes to enable the females to emerge. Some males then chew {{their way through the}} syconium wall, which allows the females to disperse after collecting pollen from the now fully developed male flowers. Females then have a short time (< 48 hours) to find a <b>tree</b> <b>with</b> receptive syconia to successfully reproduce and disperse pollen.|$|E

5|$|Suillus brevipes is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, and {{it develops}} a close symbiotic {{association with the}} roots of various tree species, especially pine. The underground mycelia form a sheath around the tree rootlets, and the fungal hyphae penetrate between the cortical cells of the root, forming ectomycorrhizae. In this way, the fungus can supply the <b>tree</b> <b>with</b> minerals, while the tree reciprocates by supplying carbohydrates created by photosynthesis. In nature, it associates with two- and three-needle pines, especially lodgepole and ponderosa pine. Under controlled laboratory conditions, the fungus {{has been shown to}} form ectomycorrhizae with ponderosa, lodgepole, loblolly, eastern white, patula, pond, radiata, and red pines. In vitro mycorrhizal associations formed with non-pine species include Pacific madrone, bearberry, western larch, Sitka spruce, and coast Douglas-fir. Fungal growth is inhibited by the presence of high levels of the heavy metals cadmium (350ppm), lead (200ppm), and nickel (20ppm).|$|E

5|$|All puzzles {{are based}} on a {{mechanic}} of tracing a path through a maze-like route from a starting point, represented as a circle, to a goal point, represented as a line segment with a rounded end, without crossing one's path. The goal of these puzzles is not always to simply complete the maze but to find the right path that completes the puzzle correctly. Mazes may have several starting points and goals; the player may have to find the right starting point that can complete the maze, or they may {{have to figure out how}} to reach a specific end point to trigger an event in the surrounding environment such as moving a platform. The puzzles include a symbolic language that denotes the mechanics for that maze. For example, puzzles that present mazes with black and white squares in the spaces between traceable paths require the player to find a path through the maze that separates these squares by color. Other puzzles require the player to use the environment to determine how to solve the puzzle, such as studying a nearby <b>tree</b> <b>with</b> branches that mimic the puzzle, or by observing symbols on nearby floors and walls that align with the puzzle's configuration. The puzzles within each island section {{are based on}} common mechanic, often with a sequence of puzzles appearing early in each section that are designed to help the player identify and understand the mechanic and meaning of the symbols. Later puzzles combine two or more different mechanics into the same puzzle using the consistent symbolic language.|$|E
5|$|Inspiration for {{the book}} came from a Douglas-fir <b>tree</b> <b>with</b> a curve in its trunk. While sitting by the tree, at his home on Quadra Island, near Vancouver, David Suzuki {{realized}} that even though his family had played on it for years, {{he did not know}} how old it was or how its uncharacteristic curve had developed. Suzuki, a science writer and broadcaster, and former zoologist, speculated that the soil might have slid when the tree was young or that another plant might have blocked the sunlight. He thought that the tree must have endured much hardship throughout its life and made a connection between biographies of people and the story of this tree's life. It also reminded him of an idea he had for a children's book about interconnectivity of life, especially within plants. Along with a research assistant, he studied the topic. Suzuki started to write a draft but a busy schedule interfered so he sought a collaborator. Science writer and former Harrowsmith editor Wayne Grady agreed to participate. Suzuki provided the research, framework, and some original writing and Grady did most of the writing. Together, Grady in Ontario and Suzuki in Vancouver, went through five drafts. Wildlife artist Robert Bateman was brought into the project through social connections between the wives of Bateman and Suzuki. In creating the book, their intention was to illustrate the complexity and interconnectivity of this ecosystem by focusing on one tree's role over time.|$|E
