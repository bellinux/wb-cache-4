25|$|By {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, the {{principles}} of classical liberalism were being increasingly challenged by downturns in economic growth, a growing perception of the evils of poverty, unemployment and relative deprivation present within modern industrial cities, and the agitation of organised labour. The ideal of the self-made individual, who through hard work and talent could make his or her place in <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>seemed</b> increasingly implausible. A major political reaction against the changes introduced by industrialisation and laissez-faire capitalism came from conservatives concerned about social balance, although socialism later became a more important force for change and reform. Some Victorian writers – including Charles Dickens, Thomas Carlyle and Matthew Arnold – became early influential critics of social injustice.|$|E
500|$|During the Seven Days Battles that {{followed}} in late June, Longstreet had operational command of {{nearly half of}} Lee's army15 brigadesas it drove McClellan back down the Peninsula. Longstreet performed aggressively and well in his new, larger command, particularly at Gaines' Mill and Glendale. Lee's army in general suffered from weak performances by Longstreet's peers, including, uncharacteristically, Stonewall Jackson, {{and was unable to}} destroy the Union Army. Moxley Sorrel wrote of Longstreet's confidence and calmness in battle: [...] "He was like a rock in steadiness when sometimes in battle <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>seemed</b> flying to pieces." [...] Gen. Lee said, [...] "Longstreet was the staff in my right hand." [...] He had been established as Lee's principal lieutenant.|$|E
500|$|To {{mark the}} 30th {{anniversary of the}} album's release, Harrison {{supervised}} a remastered edition of All Things Must Pass, which was issued in January 2001, {{less than a year}} before his death from cancer at the age of 58. The reissue appeared on Gnome Records, a label specifically set up by him for the project. Harrison oversaw revisions to Wilkes and Feinstein's album artwork, which included a colorised [...] "George & the Gnomes" [...] front cover and, on the two CD sleeves and the album booklet, further examples of this cover image showing an imaginary, gradual encroachment of urbanisation on the Friar Park landscape. The latter series served to illustrate Harrison's dismay at [...] "the direction <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>seemed</b> headed {{at the start of the}} millennium", Gary Tillery observes, a direction that was [...] "so far afield from the Age of Aquarius that had been the dream of the sixties". Harrison launched a website dedicated to the reissue, which offered, in the description of Chuck Miller of Goldmine magazine, [...] "graphics and sounds and little Macromedia-created gnomes dancing and giggling and playing guitars in a Terry Gilliam-esque world". As a further example of his willingness to embrace modern media, Harrison prepared an electronic press kit, which he described as [...] "not exactly an EPK but it is a threat to world order as we know it".|$|E

2500|$|The web of canals was {{reflected}} in their art, culture, and symbolic thinking. For the Zenú, <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to be a large}} wicker-work, on which living beings were placed. This symbolism is reflected in the patterns of fishing nets, textiles, pottery and goldwork. As the web of channels was the place where daily life took place, so also did people and animals appear in the metallic fabric of cast semi-filigree earrings.|$|E
2500|$|Well, we had {{not much}} to say in favour of the {{constitution}} of the Reich; we admitted that it consisted entirely of lawful misuses, but it rose therefore the higher over the present French constitution which is operating in a maze of unlawful misuses, whose government displays its energies in the wrong places and therefore has to face the challenge that a thorough change in the state of affairs is widely prophesied. In contrast when we looked towards the north, from there shone Frederick, the Pole Star, around whom Germany, Europe, even <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>seemed</b> to turn ...|$|E
