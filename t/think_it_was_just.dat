25|$|I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a {{reflection}} of the total anxiety and emotion of that period. There's {{a hell of a lot}} of spontaneity about that album. We went in with virtually nothing and everything just came pouring out.|$|E
500|$|Yeah, we {{were kind}} of {{disappointed}} [...] because it sold really well. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> the timing because One Direction at the same time shot straight to number one with 'Little Things'. It's always hard to compete with the 1D lads.

Two people were taken to a first aid station, and a third person {{was taken to a}} local hospital because of an asthma attack. The ride reopened the next day and park spokesman Robin Innes said the accident was caused by rain: [...] "We <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> caused by excessive moisture on the tracks due to the heavy rain storms we had in the morning" [...] he said.|$|E

500|$|Actress Natalie Dormer, who {{was cast}} to play Queen Margaery Tyrell in the show's second season, also made her final {{appearance}} {{as a main}} cast member for the series. In contrast to Chapman, Dormer found out about her character's impending death approximately {{six months before the}} rest of the cast, saying [...] "I requested while making season 5 that showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss release me from working on the show earlier than usual so I could do another project, and they ended up phoning me — and that was The Call. But I got it six months ahead of normal. They were like, 'We weren't going to tell you this for a few more months, but we're not going to release you now, so you can't do that job {{you really want to do}} and we're really sorry about that. But on the bright side, we are going to release you proper in the not-so-distant future.' It was good news, bad news — no you can't do this, but don't worry, you're going to have lots more opportunities very soon." [...] Dormer also stated about her departure, [...] "It's the longest time I've ever spent playing a character. I'll always have a little yellow rose after my heart, and I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> the right length of time, to be honest. It's time for the Westeros story to move on and it's a perfect time for her to exit." ...|$|E
500|$|Before Megan Mullally {{was given}} the role of Karen, she had {{previously}} been cast as a series regular on sitcoms such as The Ellen Burstyn Show, My Life and Times, and Rachel Gunn. Mullally guest starred on many other shows, including Ned & Stacey, on which she first worked with Messing. Mullally informed her agent {{that she did not}} want to do any more sitcoms or auditions for sitcoms, during the time that Will & Grace came around. [...] "Because my feeling was, like, Look, I've done it. It's not clicking. It's not for me. But he [...] was always arguing the point that the right thing hadn't come along yet." [...] She initially auditioned for the role of Grace, but admitted that {{she did not want to}} audition for the part of Karen. When asked about Karen's voice, Mullally revealed that the voice was an [...] "instinctive thing". She also said, [...] "...I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a feeling that I had that it would be better for the pace of the show and it would be funnier in some way, but I didn't know why. Karen has a lot of joy, even when she's in a bad mood. She's pretty much happy with who she is, and that is something I think is a great thing to play, because the character of Karen could have been very unlikeable, and I think she's likeable because she has joy and she can be very childlike." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Remember Paul?" [...] {{was written}} by series creator and {{executive}} producer Marc Cherry and directed by David Grossman. It marked the debut of Vanessa Williams as Renee Perry, an old college rival of Lynette Scavo. The addition of Williams to the cast was announced after {{the close of the}} series' sixth season, as well as the finale of the ABC series Ugly Betty, in which Williams starred as Wilhelmina Slater. The character, who was originally named Renee Filmore-Jones, was conceived as a trouble-making vixen, similar to the Edie Britt character (Nicollette Sheridan), who appeared on the series until the fifth season. Following the casting announcement, Williams admitted to having been a fan of the series during its first year, but stopped watching because of the racially insensitive second season mystery storyline. It focused on Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard), the series' first black main character. Williams explained to Entertainment Weekly, [...] " [...] had her son in chains in the basement. It was like, 'Really? Do we have to go there with our first Black character?' I honestly fell off the show after that. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> so implausible and just an image that Black folks don't want to see their child chained and shackled in the basement." [...] Cast member Felicity Huffman commented on Williams' addition to the cast, saying [...] "She's such a great dash of vinegar to Wisteria Lane! It's going brilliantlyshe's a wonderful woman, she's really smart, she's really strong, a real team player. She's a great addition." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{training}} camp in the summer months, held outside the Don Hutson Center, young Packers fans can bring their bikes and have their favorite players ride them from the locker room to practice at Ray Nitschke Field. This old tradition began {{around the time of}} Lambeau Field's construction in 1957. Gary Knafelc, a Packers end at the time, said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> that kids wanted us to ride their bikes. I can remember kids saying, 'Hey, ride my bike.'" [...] Each new generation of Packer fan delights at the opportunity.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 June 2009 ex-communities {{secretary}} Hazel Blears, {{who chose}} to resign from the government just before the English county council and European elections, said that she regretted the timing of her decision. She also stated that her decision to wear a brooch with the words 'rocking the boat' {{on the same day}} as the resignation was a [...] "stupid thing to do". Speaking to the Manchester Evening News she said of the brooch [...] "It was a brooch my husband had given me. I'd had four weeks of intense media pressure, the like of which I have never known, not just on me but on my husband, my dad, my family. At that point I'd had enough. It was a stupid thing to do but I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> trying to put a brave face on—not going out cowed on the basis of expenses claims that genuinely are not true." ...|$|E

60|$|During {{the ride}} Kate took the lead, with Jacques {{on her left}} and Harry on her right, while Charley brought up the rear, and conversed in a loud key with all three. At length Kate began to <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> {{possible}} the horses might be growing wearied with the slapping pace, and checked her steed; {{but this was not}} an easy matter, as the horse seemed to hold quite a contrary opinion, and showed a desire not only to continue but to increase its gallop--a propensity that induced Harry to lend his aid by grasping the rein and compelling the animal to walk.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, sir, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> tiredness, and may be, {{a little}} {{something}} hot at that supper last night; and, besides, seeing so many queer things in pantermimes might put notions in a child's head. But {{when she came home}} last night, a little late, Lizer was very strange. She vowed and swore she had seen a large Bird, far bigger than any common bird, skim over the street. Then when I had put her to bed in the attic, down she flies, screaming she saw the Bird on the roof. I had hard work to get her to sleep. To-day I made her lay a-bed and wear her theatre pantermime bearskin, that fits her like another skin--and she'll be too big for it next year--just to keep her warm in that cold garret. That's all about it, sir. She'll be well enough in a day or two, will Lizer." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{think the}} house will do splendidly. The Lindens is the name, and {{it is on the}} Maybury Road, not {{more than a quarter of}} a mile from the station. If your mother and you could come down on Tuesday or Wednesday, I should get a half-day off, and you would be able to inspect it. Such a nice little lawn in front, and garden behind. A conservatory, if you please, dining-room and drawing-room. You can never {{assemble}} more than four or five guests. On your at-home days, we shall put up little placards as they do outside the theatres, 'Drawing-room full,' 'Dining-room full,' 'Room in the Conservatory.' There are two good bedrooms, one large maid's room, and a lumber- room. One cook and one housemaid could run it beautifully. Rent 50 pounds on a three years' lease--with taxes, about 62 pounds. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> built for us.
