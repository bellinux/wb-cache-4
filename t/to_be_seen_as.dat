5|$|In 1997–98, Jovanovski {{appeared}} in 81 games, recording nine goals and 23 points. With his contract set to expire following the 1998–99 season, Jovanovski was beginning <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a disappointment in Florida, failing {{to improve on}} his successful rookie year.|$|E
5|$|A {{movement}} by women arose from Seattle during the Depression. Fueled by Eleanor Roosevelt’s book It’s Up to the Women, women pushed for recognition, {{not just as}} housewives, but as the backbone to family. Using newspapers and journals Working Woman and The Woman Today, women pushed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> equal and receive some recognition.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, radar made {{camouflage}} {{generally less}} effective, though coastal boats are sometimes painted like land vehicles. Aircraft camouflage too came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> less important because of radar, and aircraft of different air forces, {{such as the}} Royal Air Force's Lightning, were often uncamouflaged.|$|E

5|$|Allied {{planners}} began formulating {{their plans}} for the future direction of the fighting in the wider Pacific with a focus upon retaking the Philippines and the eventual capture of the Japanese Home Islands. The lynchpin to Japanese strength in the region was their main base at Rabaul. The reduction of this base came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a key tenet of success in the SWPA for the Allies and was formalised into Operation Cartwheel.|$|E
5|$|Historically {{regarded}} as a barren, desolate and dangerous to cross, the Pine Bush has come <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a historical, cultural, and environmental asset to the Capital District and Hudson Valley regions of New York. It {{is home to the}} Karner blue butterfly, an endangered species first identified by author Vladimir Nabokov in 1944 using a type specimen from the Pine Bush.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's last album, Invincible, was {{released}} six years later, in 2001, his longest period between full studio records. Following {{a conflict between}} Jackson and his record label, Sony Music stopped promoting the album. Invincible would go on <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a relative commercial disappointment when compared to Jackson's prior solo material, although it sold 13 million copies worldwide.|$|E

5|$|Millennium Group {{consultant}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is {{approached by}} the FBI when {{a series of}} bombs are detonated in Washington, DC. Black's investigation soon reveals that the culprit seeks <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a hero, setting off explosions in order to rescue people from the scenes; leaving Black {{to track down the}} fame-hungry bomber before more people are killed.|$|E
5|$|Overall Set {{was viewed}} with ambivalence, until {{during the first}} {{millennium}} BCE he came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a totally malevolent deity. This transformation was prompted more by his association with foreign lands than by the Osiris myth. Nevertheless, in these late times, the widespread temple rituals involving the ceremonial annihilation of Set were often connected with the myth.|$|E
5|$|Ronnie Rocket was {{to feature}} {{many of the}} {{elements}} which have since come <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> Lynch's hallmarks; including industrial art direction, 1950s popular culture and physical deformity. The script featured a three-foot tall man with control over electricity; Lynch first met Michael J. Anderson when tentatively casting for this role, and later cast him in Twin Peaks and Mulholland Drive as a result.|$|E
3000|$|What {{explains}} this hardening {{of attitudes}} to {{the recipients of}} welfare? Commentators typically refer to “deservingness” judgements, which include judgements {{about the extent to}} which someone’s misfortune or disadvantage was under their voluntary control. But the evidence suggests that deservingness judgements also track three other criteria: “identity” (the extent <b>to</b> which recipients <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> belonging <b>to</b> a shared society), “attitude” (the extent <b>to</b> which recipients <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> accepting benefits in the spirit of civic friendship); and “reciprocity” (the extent <b>to</b> which recipients <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> likely <b>to</b> help others when it <b>is</b> their turn <b>to</b> do so). 20 [...]...|$|R

5|$|The term Żydokomuna {{originated}} {{in connection with}} the Russian Bolshevik Revolution and targeted Jewish communists during the Polish-Soviet War. The emergence of the Soviet state was seen by many Poles as Russian imperialism in a new guise. The visibility of Jews in both the Soviet leadership and in the Polish Communist Party further heightened such fears. In some circles, Żydokomuna came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a prominent antisemitic stereotype expressing political paranoia.|$|E
5|$|The {{trust the}} American people had in him was rapidly and {{severely}} tarnished by his pardon of Nixon. Nonetheless, many grant in hindsight {{that he had}} respectably discharged with considerable dignity a great responsibility {{that he had not}} sought. His subsequent loss to Carter in 1976 has come <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an honorable sacrifice he made for the nation.|$|E
5|$|The {{wide range}} of {{artifacts}} discovered at the site has caused Mummy Cave <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a highly significant site {{for the study of}} Rocky Mountain archeology.

50|$|In 2015, the NFL began {{sponsoring}} {{a series of}} public service announcements to bring attention to domestic abuse and sexual assault in response <b>to</b> what <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> poor handling of incidents of violence by players.|$|R
5|$|These dates {{correspond}} {{with the end}} of the Battle of Konigsberg, which finished on 9 April with the surrender of the German garrison. A few years later, Brusov publicly voiced a contrary opinion; this is believed to have been done due to pressure from Soviet authorities, who did not want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> responsible for the loss of the Amber Room.|$|E
5|$|When Germany {{invaded the}} Soviet Union, on 22 June 1941, it came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{unlikely}} {{that there would}} be any attempted landing as long as that conflict was undecided — from the British point of view at the time, the matter hung in the balance. In July 1941, construction of field fortifications was greatly reduced and concentration given to the possibility of a raid in force rather than a full-scale invasion.|$|E
5|$|A Peronist, Kirchner handled {{political}} power as Peronist leaders have traditionally done. He nevertheless sought to portray himself as being different from previous Peronist leaders. He made {{frequent use of}} controversies with other political or social forces and the polarization of public opinion, which became characteristic of his political style. This strategy was used against the financial sector, the military and police, foreign countries, international bodies, newspapers, and Duhalde himself {{with varying degrees of}} success. Kirchner sought to generate an image contrasting with those of former presidents Carlos Menem and Fernando de la Rúa. Menem was seen as frivolous and De la Rúa as doubtful, so Kirchner tried <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> serious and determined.|$|E
5000|$|The People's Port {{campaign}} has also interested the Labour Party head of Policy, Dr Jon Cruddas, MP, {{who appears to}} <b>see</b> it <b>as</b> a mutual ownership model for national assets that could be adopted by the Labour Party.

Other Conservatives <b>see</b> Elphicke's proposal <b>as</b> a method of populist privatisation.

5|$|Chrysippus was a {{prolific}} writer. He {{is said to}} rarely have gone without writing 500 lines a day and he composed more than 705 works. His desire to be comprehensive meant {{that he would take}} both sides of an argument and his opponents accused him of filling his books with the quotations of others. He was considered diffuse and obscure in his utterances and careless in his style, but his abilities were highly regarded, and he came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a preeminent authority for the school.|$|E
5|$|Film noirs {{tend to have}} unusually {{convoluted}} story lines, frequently involving flashbacks {{and other}} editing techniques that disrupt and sometimes obscure the narrative sequence. Framing the entire primary narrative as a flashback is also a standard device. Voiceover narration, sometimes used as a structuring device, came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a noir hallmark; while classic noir is generally associated with first-person narration (i.e., by the protagonist), Stephen Neale notes that third-person narration is common among noirs of the semidocumentary style. Neo-noirs as varied as The Element of Crime (surrealist), After Dark, My Sweet (retro), and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (meta) have employed the flashback/voiceover combination.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{foundation}} in the United Kingdom, Scouting {{spread around the}} globe. The first association outside the British Empire was founded in Chile in May 21, 1909 after a visit to Baden Powell. In most countries of the world, there is now at least one Scouting (or Guiding) organization. Each is independent, but international cooperation continues <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> part of the Scout Movement. In 1922 the WOSM started as the governing body on policy for the national Scouting organizations (then male only). In addition to being the governing policy body, it organizes the World Scout Jamboree every four years.|$|E
