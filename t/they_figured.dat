25|$|Minorities {{have made}} a major {{cultural}} contribution to Romania. Influences came from minority groups such as Greeks, Aromanians, Bulgarians, Turks, Germans, Armenians, Albanians, Tatars, Hungarians, Russians, Ukrainians, and other ethnic groups. The Székely and the Saxons living in Transylvania made many important architectural contributions to the region, including numerous churches, fortifications, and town centers. Also, <b>they</b> <b>figured</b> in some landmarks {{in the development of}} ethnic Romanian culture: the first letter written in Romanian was addressed to the mayor of Kronstadt (Romanian: Braşov), and the first book printed in Romanian was in Hermannstadt (Romanian: Sibiu).|$|E
25|$|On March 17, 1994, Stanfa and 23 of his {{men were}} arrested on {{racketeering}} related chargers. This was the second major indictment on the crime family in seven years. The Federal case was the largest prosecution of an organized crime group in Philadelphia history. The second major indictment against the crime family was another strong case for the prosecution. A key piece of evidence was two years of recorded conversations Stanfa would have with mobsters in his attorney's office and doctor's office. Believing attorney–client privilege and doctor-patient confidentiality would protect him, Stanfa openly talked about important Mafia business with his men. However, the FBI {{was able to get}} a warrant to place covert listening devices in both offices once <b>they</b> <b>figured</b> out they were being used to aid criminal conspiracies. The secretly recorded conversations implicated Stanfa and his men of many criminal acts. The star witness at the trial was John Veasey, who was recruited by Stanfa to fight in the war against Merlino and eventually was inducted into the family. Before this, Veasey had no connection to the Mafia or organized crime.|$|E
25|$|Publishers often funded {{trade-in}} {{deals to}} encourage consumers to purchase new games. Trade-in customers at the Australia retailer Game would purchase twice the games per year as non-trade-in customers. The sale of pre-owned games kept retailers in business, and composed {{about a third}} of Game's revenue. Retailers also saved on the UK's value-added tax, which only taxed the retailer's profit on pre-owned games, rather than the full sale on regular games. The former trade-in retail executives behind the trade-in price comparison site Trade In Detectives estimated that the United Kingdom's trade-in industry was {{about a third of}} the size of its new games business. <b>They</b> <b>figured</b> that sites such as eBay, which convert used games into cash, compose about a quarter of the UK's trade-in market, but do not keep the credit within the industry. While consumers might appear to receive better offers on these sites, they also take about 15 percent of the selling price in fees. Alternatively, some retailers will match the trade-in values offered by their competitors. Microsoft's original plan for the Xbox One attempted to translate trade-in deals for the digital marketplace, with a database of product licenses that shops would be able to resell with publisher permission, though the plan was poorly received or poorly sold.|$|E

500|$|Tito Puente and his Latin jazz {{ensemble}} {{appear in}} the episode and sing the song [...] "Señor Burns". Oakley and Weinstein were unfamiliar with Puente and wrote him into the episode because Groening is a fan. <b>They</b> <b>figured</b> he would sing the song, but later discovered that Puente was a drummer, not a singer. The lyrics were sung by one of Puente's band members. His band would also play their version of The Simpsons theme over the end credits.|$|E
500|$|Collier was {{assigned}} to the Great Lakes Naval Training Station north of Chicago, where he was a survival swimming instructor. It was in the Navy that Collier first had trouble with his hearing, a problem that dogged him later in life. He was once called to report to his ship over a loudspeaker but did not hear it. Doctors thought his hearing may have been damaged by teaching swimming in a tidal pool or from practicing on the shooting range. [...] "It never became an issue until the Navy, when <b>they</b> <b>figured</b> he had less than 40% of a normal person's hearing," [...] his daughter Kay Collier-Slone said in 1997. To compensate for his hearing loss, Collier became an expert lip-reader.|$|E
500|$|The {{news of the}} {{assassination}} of Abraham Lincoln on 15 April, 1865 caused demonstrations of sorrow in Sydney. An editorial in Melbourne's [...] "The Age" [...] newspaper on June 27, 1865 reported that in Sydney {{the assassination}} of Lincoln had caused great indignation. There were many Australian sympathisers that wanted {{to put an end}} to slavery, a central issue with Lincoln and his Emancipation Proclamation. A memorial service was held in Sydney's Prince of Wales Opera House on Sunday afternoon July 9, 1865. There were strong feelings of anger at public meetings against the killer of Lincoln, a person so dedicated to his country. <b>They</b> <b>figured</b> he was a genius who rose [...] "from a log cabin to the White House." ...|$|E

500|$|Because of his {{fluency in}} several languages, Sarria was {{assigned}} to Intelligence School. However, following a routine background check for security clearance, he was advised that {{he would no longer}} be in the program. Sarria assumed that it was because investigators discovered his homosexuality. [...] "I mean I had no lisp, but I wasn't the most masculine guy in town... So I think that <b>they</b> <b>figured</b> that I was a little bit gay." [...] Sarria officially remained attached to the Signal Corps but was ordered to Cooks and Bakers School and trained as a cook. After graduating from cooking school, he {{was assigned to}} train as a scout, but deliberately failed the training because of the dangerous nature of the assignment. He was then assigned to the motor pool.|$|E
500|$|The season {{one episode}} [...] "Death" [...] heavily {{influenced}} the film's screenplay. The plot and theme of both scripts revolves heavily around {{the parents of}} South Park protesting about Terrance and Phillip due to the perceived negative influence it has over their children. Parker said, [...] "After about {{the first year of}} South Park, Paramount already wanted to make a South Park movie, and we sort of thought this episode would make the best model just because we liked the sort of pointing at ourselves kind of thing." [...] During the time, the team was also busy writing the second and third seasons of the series, the former of which Parker and Stone later described as [...] "disastrous". As such, <b>they</b> <b>figured</b> the phenomenon would be over soon, and they decided to write a personal, fully committed musical.|$|E
500|$|As the POWs had no {{knowledge}} of the upcoming assault, they went through their normal routine that night. The previous day, two Filipino boys had thrown rocks into the prisoner side of the camp with notes attached, [...] "Be ready to go out." [...] Assuming that the boys were pulling a prank, the POWs disregarded the notes. The POWs were becoming more wary of the Japanese guards, believing that anytime {{in the next few days}} they could be massacred for any reason. <b>They</b> <b>figured</b> that the Japanese would not want them to be rescued by advancing American forces, regain their strength, and return to fight the Japanese again. In addition, the Japanese could kill the prisoners to prevent them from telling of the atrocities of the Bataan Death March or the conditions in the camp. With the limited Japanese guard, a small group of prisoners had already decided that they would make an escape attempt at about 20:00.|$|E

500|$|Around 8:30 on {{the morning}} of 11 September 2001, the Otis Air Base Operations Center {{received}} a call from the Federal Aviation Administration's Cape Cod Facility Calls Operations Center that it might be receiving a call from the North American Aerospace Defense Command's Northeast Air Defense Sector. The manager of the Cape Cod facility then called the 102d at Otis Air National Guard Base as <b>they</b> <b>figured</b> [...] "...a call [...] will be coming from NEADS soon and a scramble order is likely." [...] He called the base because he figured that the pilots would appreciate the heads up. When he called the Otis operations center, the superintendent of aviation management, Mark Rose, answered. He was initially confused by the call as no identification was given. Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Duffy was then handed the phone and alerted of the situation. On his radio, he called pilot Major Daniel Nash, the pilot who was sharing alert duty, and told him to get ready for a coming alert call. He also told him to suit up and get ready for a scramble call.|$|E
500|$|Ninja Gaiden III: The Ancient Ship of Doom was {{designed}} by Masato Kato, who took over Hideo Yoshizawa's main role in the game's development from the previous two titles. In an interview with Kato, he said that Ninja GaidenIII needed [...] "to go into a new direction". The game was given more of a science-fiction motif {{as opposed to the}} Cthulhu Mythos motif in the previous two titles; the enemies changed to look more robotic than in the previous games. The original intent from the developers was to make the game easier than the previous titles, [...] "to create a game a normal player can enjoy". However, the perceived popularity of difficult video games in North America caused Tecmo to release the game for the NES with a much higher difficulty level than the Japanese version. They also decided to place the events of Ninja GaidenIII between the events of the first two titles in order to maintain continuity; <b>they</b> <b>figured</b> that it was too difficult to continue the story after , so they developed the plot sometime before the events of Ninja GaidenII that revolved around the game's main antagonist, Foster.|$|E
500|$|The graphic emblem most {{associated}} with the straight edge movement is a black [...] "X", typically drawn on the wearer's hands with a marker. According to MacKaye, [...] "We were in San Francisco, and we played a place called Mabuhay Gardens. <b>They</b> <b>figured</b> out we were underage, and they wouldn't let us play. We worked out a deal with their management that {{we just wanted to}} play and we weren't going to drink, so they got a marker and put a big 'X' on our hand, So we came back to Washington D.C. and went to this nightclub, the 9:30, and said 'Hey look, we're not going to drink and we will put this 'X' on our hand. If you see us drinking you can throw us out forever. We are not going to drink, we just came to see the music'". The band adopted the marking, and though it was initially meant to signify youth, it became a wider emblem for bands prepared to play to audiences under the legal age to be served alcohol. MacKaye noted that at the time the symbol [...] "wasn't supposed to signify straight edge—it was supposed to signify kids. It was about being young punk rockers... it represents youth".|$|E

500|$|Grant then {{ordered an}} {{immediate}} assault on nearby Fort Donelson, {{under the command}} of John B. Floyd, which dominated the Cumberland River. Unlike Fort Henry, Grant was now going up against a force equal to his. Unaware of the garrison's strength, Grant's forces approached the scene over-confident from their easy victory at Fort Henry. Grant, McClernand, and Smith positioned their divisions around the fort. The next day McClernand and Smith launched probing attacks on what <b>they</b> <b>figured</b> were weak spots in the Confederate line, only to retreat with heavy losses. On February 14, Foote's gunboats arrived and began bombarding the fort, only to be repulsed by the heavy guns at the fort. Foote himself was wounded. Thus far it was a victory for the Confederates, but soon Union reinforcements arrived, giving Grant a total force of over 40,000 men. When Foote regained control of the river, Grant resumed his attack, but a standoff remained. That evening Confederate commander Floyd called a council of war, unsure of his next action. Grant received a dispatch from Foote, requesting that they meet. Grant mounted a horse and rode seven miles over freezing roads and trenches, reaching Smith's division, instructing him to prepare for the next assault, and rode on and met up with McClernand and Wallace. After exchanging reports he met up with Foote. After they conferred, Foote resumed his bombardment, which signaled the other generals to resume the attack. After a day of battle, Fort Donelson submitted to Grant's demand for [...] "unconditional and immediate surrender", and Floyd struck his flag. Grant telegraphed Halleck, informing him that Fort Donelson had fallen.|$|E

A lot of men—especially around our age—were so stunned {{when he lost}} that <b>they</b> <b>figured</b> he must have tanked. Budge is {{convinced}} of that. But what motive would Riggs have for that? Bobby Riggs, the biggest ham in the world, gets his greatest audience—and purposefully looks bad? There's no way. If he had beaten Billie Jean, he could have kept the act going indefinitely.

2500|$|The {{camouflage}} {{effect was}} designed by R/Greenberg Associates, {{under the direction of}} Joel Hynek. The idea for the effect came in a dream one of the Thomas brothers (who wrote the film) had, in which there was a chrome man who was inside a reflective sphere. The man blended in, perfectly camouflaged, reflecting from all directions and only visible when in motion. It took quite a while before <b>they</b> <b>figured</b> out how to do it, which was basically an image repeated in a pattern of ripples {{in the shape of the}} Predator's body. It proved very effective and was a new way of presenting an [...] "invisible man." [...] Before there was digital rendering technology all of the camouflage was done optically using photo-chemical means, so that one would never get the same result twice from combining the same pieces of film.|$|E
2500|$|BioShock {{director}} Ken Levine described Andrew Ryan as {{a character}} of ideals, {{in contrast to the}} game's other antagonist, Frank Fontaine, who has no ideals. Designing the encounter between the player and Ryan was a controversial decision for the developers, due {{to the question of what}} the player's motive is at this point. Ryan taking his own life to prevent Jack, the protagonist, from accomplishing this, was described as the [...] "ultimate insult" [...] by Levine. The scene took a long time for the developers to finish. Levine stated that <b>they</b> <b>figured</b> out who the character of Andrew Ryan is too early, adding that they underestimated the impact that this would make. While he is saner than the opponents the players encounter before him, including a plastic surgeon who takes his ideal of beauty too far, he is as unmovable as they are, unwilling to change his ideals. When discussing how many people would get the good ending to BioShock, he commented that Ryan would not, choosing to take the easier path.|$|E
