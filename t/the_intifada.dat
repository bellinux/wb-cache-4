5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Intifada</b> {{began as}} an {{uprising}} of Palestinian youth against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. On June 7, 1986, about a year before <b>the</b> <b>Intifada</b> started, al-Wazir was deported from Amman to Baghdad, eventually moving to Tunisia days after King Hussein declared that efforts in establishing a joint strategy for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict between Jordan and the PLO were over.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} tactic used by Palestinians during <b>the</b> <b>Intifada</b> was {{throwing}} stones, molotov cocktails, and burning tires. The local leadership in some West Bank towns commenced non-violent protests against Israeli occupation {{by engaging in}} tax resistance and other boycotts. Israel responded by confiscating {{large sums of money}} in house-to-house raids. As <b>the</b> <b>Intifada</b> came to a close, new armed Palestinian groups—in particular Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)—began targeting Israeli civilians with the new tactic of suicide bombings, and internal fighting amongst the Palestinians increased dramatically.|$|E
5|$|The {{economical}} situation Tubas {{during the}} 199399 period was prosperous, however {{since the start}} of the Second Intifada in 200001, Tubas' income level has decreased by roughly 40%. Prior to <b>the</b> <b>Intifada,</b> the average household income was 2,500 NIS, receding to about 1,500 NIS. A major factor that has resulted from the conflict was the confiscation of agricultural land located within the city's or its governorate's jurisdiction by Israeli settlements or military authorities. According to the PCBS, in 1999, approximately 52% of the citizens were within the working age (15-64). Of the city's labor force, 48% are females. The unemployment rate increased dramatically from 20% in 1999 to 70% after the year 2000. Prior to <b>the</b> <b>Intifada,</b> 35% of the total labor force worked in Israel.|$|E
50|$|According to the United Nations OCHA, three local {{residents}} were killed during <b>the</b> First <b>Intifada</b> and one during <b>the</b> Second <b>Intifada.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> First Sahrawi <b>Intifada</b> {{began in}} 1999 and lasted until 2004, {{transforming}} into <b>the</b> Independence <b>Intifada</b> in 2005. <b>The</b> First Sahrawi <b>Intifada</b> formed {{a part of}} the wider and still ongoing Western Sahara conflict.|$|R

5|$|Before 2000, 13.4% of Nablus' {{residents}} {{worked in}} Israel, with the figure dropping to 4.7% in 2004. The city's manufacturing sector made up 15.7% {{of the economy}} in 2004, a drop from 21% in 2000. Since 2000, most of the workforce has been employed in agriculture and local trade. In the wake of <b>the</b> <b>Intifada,</b> unemployment rates rose from 14.2% in 1997 to 60% in 2004. According to an OCHA report in 2008, {{one of the reasons for}} the high unemployment was a ring of checkpoints around the city, leading to the relocation of many businesses.|$|E
5|$|On 28September2000, then-opposition {{leader of}} Israel Ariel Sharon {{and members of}} the Likud Party, along with 1,000 armed guards, visited the al-Aqsa compound; a large group of Palestinians went to protest the visit. After Sharon and the Likud Party members left, a {{demonstration}} erupted and Palestinians {{on the grounds of the}} Haram al-Sharif began throwing stones and other projectiles at Israeli riot police. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at the crowd, injuring 24 people. The visit sparked a five-year uprising by the Palestinians, commonly referred to as the al-Aqsa Intifada, though some commentators, citing subsequent speeches by PA officials, particularly Imad Falouji and Arafat himself, claim that <b>the</b> <b>Intifada</b> had been planned months in advance, as early as July upon Yasser Arafat's return from Camp David talks. On 29September, the Israeli government deployed 2,000 riot police to the mosque. When a group of Palestinians left the mosque after Friday prayers (Jumu'ah,) they hurled stones at the police. The police then stormed the mosque compound, firing both live ammunition and rubber bullets at the group of Palestinians, killing four and wounding about 200.|$|E
25|$|Palestinians sources claim 2,736 Palestinians {{killed in}} <b>the</b> <b>Intifada.</b>|$|E
50|$|Al-Qassam Brigades militants {{were among}} the armed groups that {{launched}} both military-style attacks and suicide bombings against Israeli civilian and military targets during <b>the</b> Second <b>Intifada</b> (also known as <b>the</b> Al-Aqsa <b>Intifada</b> (انتفاضة الأقصى, Intifāat El Aqa; אינתיפאדת אל-אקצה, Intifādat El-Aqtzah), which began in late September 2000. This Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule {{in the occupied territories}} was much more violent than <b>the</b> First <b>Intifada.</b> <b>The</b> military and civilian death toll was estimated at 5,500 Palestinians, more than 1,100 Israelis, and 64 foreigners. A 2007 study of Palestinian suicide bombings during <b>the</b> Second <b>Intifada</b> (September 2000 through August 2005) found that about 40 percent were carried out by the al-Qassam Brigades.|$|R
25|$|In 1987, {{following}} <b>the</b> First <b>Intifada,</b> <b>the</b> Islamic Resistance Movement, or Hamas {{was established}} from Brotherhood-affiliated charities and social institutions that had gained a strong foothold among the local population.

50|$|Shot before <b>the</b> Second <b>Intifada,</b> <b>the</b> movie steers {{clear of}} {{political}} themes, focusing instead on social issues.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Intifada</b> is {{sometimes}} called the Oslo War (מלחמת אוסלו) by some Israelis who consider {{it to be the}} result of concessions made by Israel following the Oslo Accords, and Arafat's War, after the late Palestinian leader whom some blamed for starting it. Others have named what they consider disproportionate response to what was initially a popular uprising by unarmed demonstrators as the reason for the escalation of <b>the</b> <b>Intifada</b> into an all out war.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Intifada</b> was {{recognized}} as an occasion where the Palestinians acted cohesively and independently of their leadership or assistance of neighbouring Arab states.|$|E
25|$|Barghouti {{also went}} {{on record as}} stating that the example of Hezbollah and Israel's {{withdrawal}} from Lebanon was a factor which contributed to <b>the</b> <b>Intifada.</b>|$|E
50|$|Beit Sahour is {{a center}} of Palestinian {{political}} activism. The town {{played a key role}} in the First and Second Intifadas, with local activists pioneering nonviolent resistance techniques. During <b>the</b> First <b>Intifada</b> and <b>the</b> Second <b>Intifada,</b> <b>the</b> Palestinian Center for Rapprochement between Peoples (PCR) based in Beit Sahour encouraged non-violent activism under the aegis of the International Solidarity Movement. George Rishmawi is director of PCR. During <b>the</b> First <b>Intifada,</b> <b>the</b> Palestinian Center for Rapprochement between Peoples issued an invitation to Israelis of goodwill to come and spend a weekend (Shabbat) in Palestinian homes using the slogan “Break Bread, Not Bones”.|$|R
25|$|After {{the signing}} of the Oslo Accords failed to bring about a Palestinian state, in September 2000 <b>the</b> Second <b>Intifada</b> (uprising) broke out, a period of {{intensified}} Palestinian–Israeli violence, which has been taking place until the present day. <b>The</b> Second <b>Intifada</b> has caused thousands of victims on both sides, both among combatants and among civilians, and has been more deadly than <b>the</b> first <b>Intifada.</b> Many Palestinians consider <b>the</b> Second <b>Intifada</b> to be a legitimate war of national liberation against foreign occupation, whereas many Israelis consider it to be a terrorist campaign.|$|R
50|$|Al-Qassam Brigades militants {{were among}} the armed groups that {{launched}} both military-style attacks and suicide bombings against Israeli civilian and military targets during <b>the</b> Second <b>Intifada</b> (also known as <b>the</b> Al-Aqsa <b>Intifada</b> (انتفاضة الأقصى, Intifāat El Aqa; אינתיפאדת אל-אקצה, Intifādat El-Aqtzah), which began in late September 2000.

25|$|On 29 September 2001 Marwan Barghouti, {{the leader}} of the Fatah Tanzim in an {{interview}} to Al-Hayat, described his role in the lead up to <b>the</b> <b>intifada.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Intifada</b> {{broke the}} image of Jerusalem as a united Israeli city. There was {{unprecedented}} international coverage, and the Israeli response was criticized in media outlets and international fora.|$|E
25|$|The ending {{date of the}} Second Intifada is disputed, {{as there}} was no {{definite}} event that brought it to an end. Some commentators such as Sever Plocker consider <b>the</b> <b>intifada</b> to have ended in late 2004. With the sickness and then death of Yasser Arafat in November 2004, the Palestinians lost their internationally recognised leader of the previous three decades, after which <b>the</b> <b>intifada</b> lost momentum and lead to internal fighting between Palestinian factions (most notably the Fatah–Hamas conflict), as well as conflict within Fatah itself. Israel's unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip, announced in June 2004 completed in August 2005, is also cited, for instance by Ramzy Baroud, as signalling the end of <b>the</b> <b>intifada.</b> Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas vowed {{in the days leading}} to the Sharm el-Sheikh Summit of 2005 that it would mark the end of <b>the</b> <b>intifada.</b> The summit resulted in Abbas declaring violence would come to an end, and Ariel Sharon agreeing to release 900 Palestinian prisoners and withdraw from West Bank towns, some consider this to be the official end of the Second Intifada, although sporadic violence still continued outside PA control or condolence. On February 8, 2005 Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon announced the cease-fire. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) refused to be parties to the agreement, the cease-fire being the position of the Palestinian Authority only. Five days later Abbass reached agreement with the two dissenting organisations to commit to the truce with the proviso that Israeli violation would be met with retaliation. Schachter addressed the difficulties in deciding when this intifada ended. He reasoned that suicide bombing was the best criterion, being arguably the most important element of second intifada-related violence, and that according to this criterion <b>the</b> <b>intifada</b> ended during 2005.|$|E
50|$|The Qatari Popular Committee to Support <b>the</b> Palestinian <b>Intifada</b> was a {{committee}} established in Doha between 1988 and 1994 to lend {{financial support to}} Palestinians during <b>the</b> first <b>Intifada</b> uprising.|$|R
50|$|Following <b>the</b> Second <b>Intifada</b> <b>the</b> Israel Defense Forces {{modified}} some {{of their}} Merkavas to satisfy the needs of urban warfare.|$|R
2500|$|Among Israelis, 100 {{civilians and}} 60 IDF {{personnel}} were killed often by militants outside {{the control of}} <b>the</b> <b>Intifada's</b> UNLU, [...] and more than 1,400 Israeli civilians and 1,700 soldiers were injured.|$|R
25|$|Others {{argue that}} Palestinian National Authority has, {{throughout}} <b>the</b> <b>Intifada,</b> placed unarmed men, women, {{children and the}} elderly {{in the line of}} fire, and that announcing the time and place of anti-occupation demonstrations via television, radio, sermons, and calls from mosque loudspeaker systems is done for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|Intra-Palestinian {{violence}} {{was also a}} prominent feature of <b>the</b> <b>Intifada,</b> with widespread executions of an estimated 822 Palestinians killed as alleged Israeli collaborators, (1988–April 1994). At the time Israel reportedly obtained information from some 18,000 Palestinians who had been compromised, although fewer than half had any proven contact with the Israeli authorities.|$|E
25|$|The {{large number}} of Palestinian {{casualties}} provoked international condemnation. In subsequent resolutions, including 607 and 608, the Security Council demanded Israel cease deportations of Palestinians. In November 1988, Israel was condemned by {{a large majority of}} the UN General Assembly for its actions against <b>the</b> <b>intifada.</b> The resolution was repeated in the following years.|$|E

25|$|In the 2001 and 2002 Arab League Summits, the Arab states pledged {{support for}} <b>the</b> Second <b>Intifada</b> {{just as they}} had pledged support for <b>the</b> First <b>Intifada</b> in two {{consecutive}} summits in the late 1980s.|$|R

25|$|Al-Aqsa Intifada {{refers to}} the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the place where <b>the</b> <b>intifada</b> started. It {{is the name of}} a mosque, {{constructed}} in the 8th century CE at Al-Haram Al-Sharif, also known as the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem, a location considered the holiest site in Judaism and third holiest in Islam.|$|E
25|$|The Israeli state {{apparatus}} carried out contradictory and conflicting policies that were {{seen to have}} injured Israel's own interests, such as the closing of educational establishments (putting more youths onto the streets) and issuing the Shin Bet list of collaborators. Suicide bombings by Palestinian militants started on 16 April 1993 with the Mehola Junction bombing, carried {{at the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>Intifada.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} <b>the</b> <b>Intifada</b> gave Arafat and his {{followers}} the confidence they needed to moderate their political programme: At {{the meeting of the}} Palestine National Council in Algiers in mid-November 1988, Arafat won a majority for the historic decision to recognise Israel's legitimacy; to accept all the relevant UN resolutions going back to 29 November 1947; and to adopt the principle of a two-state solution.|$|E
