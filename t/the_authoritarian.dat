5|$|The {{existence}} of Solidarity {{and the political}} liberties that the movement brought paralyzed <b>the</b> <b>authoritarian</b> state and the state-controlled economy.

5|$|During {{the martial}} law era, Manila became a hot-bed of {{resistance}} activity as youth and student demonstrators repeatedly {{clashed with the}} police and military which were subservient to the Marcos regime.

5|$|Following {{the fall}} of <b>the</b> <b>authoritarian</b> {{government}} in Portugal in 1974, the Spanish government was the sole surviving dictatorship in Western Europe, where several countries in 1975 were ruled by socialist parties which had long loathed Franco for coming to power by overthrowing a socialist democracy. Hostility {{to the use of}} capital punishment was widespread in Western Europe at this time and most Western European countries had ceased using it.|$|E

5|$|In the 1930s Yeats {{was fascinated}} with <b>the</b> <b>authoritarian,</b> anti-democratic, {{nationalist}} movements of Europe, and he composed several marching songs for {{the far right}} Blueshirts, although they were never used. He was a fierce opponent of individualism and political liberalism, and saw the fascist movements as a triumph of public order {{and the needs of}} the national collective over petty individualism. On the other hand, he was also an elitist who abhorred the idea of mob-rule, and saw democracy as a threat to good governance and public order. After the Blueshirt movement began to falter in Ireland, he distanced himself somewhat from his previous views, but maintained a preference for authoritarian and nationalist leadership.|$|E
5000|$|The armed forces' {{officer corps}} was divided {{between those who}} {{believed}} that they should confine themselves to their barracks, and the hard-liners who regarded politicians as willing to turn Brazil to communism. The victory of the hard-liners dragged Brazil into what political scientist Juan J. Linz called [...] "an authoritarian situation." [...] However, because the hard-liners could not ignore the counterweight opinions of their colleagues or the resistance of society, {{they were unable to}} institutionalize their agenda politically. In addition, they did not attempt to eliminate liberal constitutionalism because they feared disapproval of international opinion and damage to their alignment with the United States. the United States as bastion of anticommunism during the Cold War, provided the ideology that <b>the</b> <b>authoritarians</b> used to justify their hold on power. Washington also preached liberal democracy, which forced <b>the</b> <b>authoritarians</b> to assume <b>the</b> contradictory position of defending democracy, while destroying it. Their concern for appearances caused them to abstain from personal dictatorship by requiring each successive general-president to hand over power to his replacement.|$|R

5|$|Involvement in the Spanish Civil War {{had drawn}} Mussolini closer to Hitler, helping to get Mussolini's {{agreement}} for Hitler's plans for union (Anschluss) with Austria. <b>The</b> <b>authoritarian</b> Catholic, anti-Nazi Vaterländische Front government of autonomous Austria had been successfully opposing {{the rise of}} Fascism, and following the assassination of Austria's authoritarian chancellor, Engelbert Dollfuss in 1934, had already successfully invoked Italian military assistance {{in case of a}} German invasion. Hitler's need to prevent an Italian invasion was settled with the Rome-Berlin Axis, partway into the Spanish Civil War.|$|E

5|$|The United Fruit Company {{was badly}} {{affected}} by the reforms of Jacobo Árbenz, especially Decree 900, the agrarian reform law. It responded with an intensive lobbying campaign directed at members of the United States government. The Cold War had also predisposed the Truman administration to see the Guatemalan government as communist. The CIA started to explore the notion of lending support to detractors and opponents of Árbenz. Walter Bedell Smith, the Director of Central Intelligence, ordered J. C. King, {{the chief of the}} Western Hemisphere Division, to examine whether dissident Guatemalans could topple the Árbenz government if they had support from <b>the</b> <b>authoritarian</b> governments in Central America.|$|E

5|$|With Kogălniceanu's participation, <b>the</b> <b>authoritarian</b> regime {{established}} by Cuza succeeded in promulgating {{a series of}} reforms, notably introducing the Napoleonic code, public education, and state monopolies on alcohol and tobacco. At the same time, the regime became unstable and was contested by all sides, especially after his adulterous affair with Marija Obrenović became the topic of scandal. In early 1865, Cuza came into conflict with his main ally Kogălniceanu, whom he dismissed soon after. Over the following months, the administration went into financial collapse, {{no longer able to}} provide state salaries, while Cuza came to rely on his own camarilla (courtiers).|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} the {{military}} dictatorship, Alfonsín pursued cultural and educational policies aimed at reducing <b>the</b> <b>authoritarian</b> customs of several institutions and groups. He also promoted freedom of the press. Several intellectuals and scientists who had left the country in the previous decade returned, which benefited the universities. The University of Buenos Aires returned to the quality levels that it had in the 1960s. Many intellectuals became involved in politics as well, providing a cultural perspective to the political discourse. Both Alfonsín and the Peronist Antonio Cafiero benefited.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, the {{official}} view was increasingly questioned. The aristocratic Ancien Régime had been weakened severely during the Napoleonic Wars, when the Confederacy {{had been a}} French satellite state. The episode of the Helvetic Republic, short-lived as it had been, had instilled democratic ideals in the population. The restauration of the Ancien Régime {{after the end of}} the Napoleonic era proved to be only temporary, until Switzerland became a federal state in 1848 when its first democratic constitution was passed. During the restoration, democratic publishers instrumented and interpreted the history of the peasant war as an allegory on the then current struggle for democracy, seeing the peasant war of 1653 as an early precursor of their own efforts to overcome <b>the</b> <b>authoritarian</b> regime. Well-known examples are the illustrations by Martin Disteli from 1839/40, who used scenes from the peasant war in such allegoric ways.|$|E

He also collected data on authoritarianism among North American politicians. Altemeyer's work is extensively referenced in John W. Dean's 2006 book, Conservatives Without Conscience.

[...] City editor of the USC Daily Trojan, Linda Bieber, stated that the festival would [...] "focus {{on the idea of}} knocking out oppressive and authoritarian cultures by libertarian social revolution and the idea that violent revolution will not eliminate <b>the</b> <b>authoritarians,</b> but instead will trade them in for newer models." ...|$|R
5|$|One of Dekanozov′s primary goals was the {{organization}} of a puppet government that would legitimize the occupation. On June 16, the Lithuanian government, exceeding its authority, decided that Smetona's emigration was in effect a resignation and granted Merkys full presidential powers. On June 17, Merkys appointed Justas Paleckis the new Prime Minister and confirmed the new government, known as the People's Government. Merkys and Urbšys then resigned; both would later be arrested and deported to Russia. Paleckis assumed the presidency and appointed writer Vincas Krėvė-Mickevičius as Prime Minister. The People's Government included several well-known politicians and public figures to reassure the public that the new government was not a tool of Soviet occupation, but a simple replacement of <b>the</b> <b>authoritarian</b> Smetona regime. Since there had been strong opposition to Smetona's rule, it was interpreted by some Lithuanians as a destruction of presidential power {{rather than as a}} loss of independence.|$|E
5|$|The 1974 Portuguese Carnation Revolution against <b>the</b> <b>authoritarian</b> Estado Novo {{returned}} Portugal to a {{multi-party system}} and facilitated {{the independence of}} the Portuguese colonies Angola and East Timor. In Africa, where Angolan rebels had waged a multi-faction independence war against Portuguese rule since 1961, a two-decade civil war replaced the anti-colonial struggle as fighting erupted between the communist People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), backed by the Cubans and the Soviets, and the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA), backed by the United States, the People's Republic of China, and Mobutu's government in Zaire. The United States, the apartheid government of South Africa, and several other African governments also supported a third faction, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). Without bothering to consult the Soviets in advance, the Cuban government sent a number of combat troops to fight alongside the MPLA. Foreign mercenaries and a South African armoured column were deployed to support UNITA, but the MPLA, bolstered by Cuban personnel and Soviet assistance, eventually gained the upper hand.|$|E
5|$|The article follows Gibson's {{observations}} of the architecture, phenomenology and culture of Singapore, and the clean, bland and conformist impression the city-state conveys during his stay. Its title and central metaphor—Singapore as Disneyland with the death penalty—is a reference to <b>the</b> <b>authoritarian</b> artifice the author perceives the city-state to be. Singapore, Gibson details, is lacking any sense of creativity or authenticity, absent of any indication of its history or underground culture. He finds the government to be pervasive, corporatist and technocratic, and the judicial system rigid and draconian. Singaporeans are characterized as consumerists of insipid taste. The article is accentuated by local news reports of criminal trials by which the author illustrates his observations, and bracketed by contrasting descriptions of the Southeast Asian airports he arrives and leaves by.|$|E

5|$|The {{demolition}} of the monumental statue of <b>the</b> <b>authoritarian</b> leader Enver Hohxa in Gjirokastër {{by members of}} the local Greek community in August 1991 marked the end of the one-party state. Gjirokastër suffered severe economic problems following the end of communist rule in 1991. In the spring of 1993, the region of Gjirokastër became a center of open conflict between Greek minority members and the Albanian police. The city was particularly affected by the 1997 collapse of a massive pyramid scheme which destabilised the entire Albanian economy. The city became the focus of a rebellion against the government of Sali Berisha; violent anti-government protests took place which eventually forced Berisha's resignation. On 16 December 1997, Hoxha's house was damaged by unknown attackers, but subsequently restored.|$|E
5|$|The last use {{of capital}} {{punishment}} in Spain took place on 27 September 1975 when {{two members of the}} armed Basque nationalist and separatist group ETA political-military and three members of the Revolutionary Antifascist Patriotic Front (FRAP) were shot dead by firing squads after having been convicted and sentenced to death by military tribunals for the murder of policemen and civil guards. Spain was Western Europe's only dictatorship at the time and had been unpopular and internationally isolated in the post-war period due to its relations with Nazi Germany in the 1930s and the fact that <b>the</b> <b>authoritarian</b> Spanish leader, Francisco Franco, had come to power by overthrowing a democratically elected government. As a result, the executions resulted in substantial criticism of the Spanish government, both domestically and abroad. Reactions included street protests, attacks on Spanish embassies, international criticism of the Spanish government and diplomatic measures, such as the withdrawal of the ambassadors of fifteen European countries.|$|E

40|$|Object. This article {{examines}} the ways social science research approaches <b>the</b> study of <b>authoritarian</b> regimes and identifies ways to engage with regimes that are both deliberately opaque and oppressive. Method: The paper examines existing methodological prescriptions and practices as they pertain to <b>the</b> study of <b>authoritarian</b> regimes. These cover issues of data collection, research safety, subjective safety, and the positioning of knowledge about authoritarianism within the wider scope of social sciences. Results: The paper identifies three distinct but interrelated challenges in <b>the</b> study of <b>authoritarian</b> regimes: 1) access and timing, 2) data validity and integrity, and 3) ethical issues. Conclusion: Methods commonly deployed {{in the study of}} democratic and open regimes cannot be readily deployed to <b>the</b> study of <b>authoritarian</b> ones. Greater reflexivity is needed to understand the methodological challenges inherent to the study of authoritarianism...|$|R
