Out of these talks, the Arab British Helicopter Company (ABHCO) was established during the 1970s; this new organisation was accompanied by an initial arrangement to manufacture under license the Lynx AH.1 in Helwan, Egypt. A separate agreement was formalised with Rolls-Royce <b>to</b> <b>licence</b> manufacture the Lynx's Gem engines at the Helwan facility. However, this plan was ultimately aborted {{due to a lack of}} funds that had resulted from the collapse of the Arab Organization for Industrialization (AOI).|$|E

500|$|Initially Vic Flick, who {{had played}} lead guitar on Monty Norman's {{original}} 007 theme, and Eric Clapton were asked to write and perform the theme song <b>to</b> <b>Licence</b> to Kill and they produced a theme to match Dalton's gritty performance, but the producers turned it down and instead Gladys Knight's song and performance was chosen. The song (one of the longest to ever {{be used in a}} Bond film) was based on the [...] "horn line" [...] from Goldfinger, seen as an homage to the film of the same name, which required royalty payments to the original writers. The song gave Knight her first British top-ten hit since 1977. The end credits feature the Top 10 R hit [...] "If You Asked Me To", sung by Patti LaBelle.|$|E
500|$|Pratchett {{originally}} {{wanted the}} game {{to be based on}} The Colour of Magic and for the team to work in succession through the series, but Barnett believed that would be detrimental, and thought that it was difficult to make a game based on just one book. He explained that they wanted <b>to</b> <b>licence</b> all of Discworld. An original story was made, taking elements from various Discworld books, particularly The Colour of Magic and Guards! Guards!. Barnett stated that the team had [...] "effectively written a complete film script for the game". The game introduced a new character: a practising psychiatrist (known as the psychatrickerist). Pratchett initially objected to this, but later added his input, and the character became a retro-phrenologist. Barnett stated that he wanted to create Discworld as a flagship game for CD-based systems, and thought the Discworld licence was [...] "100% suited".|$|E
500|$|The {{new owners}} {{set to work}} immediately. The dry section was {{excavated}} and lined with a butyl liner to prevent leakage. The canal was reopened in 1971. Navigation was restricted to unpowered boats, {{with the exception of}} a maintenance boat that was used for cutting weed, while the final section from Fossend to Lowdwells, which would have been part of the original main line to Exeter, is designated as a nature reserve, and so all navigation and angling is discouraged. The canal is now a designated country park, and a horse-drawn tourist narrowboat runs from Tiverton. Since 2003 powered boats have been allowed on the Canal, subject <b>to</b> <b>Licence</b> from Devon County Council. The Canal is also a very popular Coarse Fishing spot [...] and angling rights on the Canal are leased to the Tiverton and District Angling Club. In addition to holding a valid Environment Agency Rod Licence, a permit must be purchased in advance.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{nomination}} of [...] "World Enough and Time" [...] at the Nebula Awards, there was criticism of {{the inclusion of a}} fan production. Keith DeCandido, writer of Star Trek tie-in novels, wrote on his blog [...] "Look, this isn't a knock on the fan films as such. But that's what they are – they're fan films. They are not professionally produced. What's more, they're unauthorized and, by the letter of the law, illegal. In fact, {{one of the reasons why}} they're not prosecuted, is because they don't turn a profit, which is one of the legion of ways that they're not professionally produced". In response, Zicree replied with a statement to the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, explaining that the episode was produced with the full knowledge of Paramount Pictures and CBS. He explained the involvement of Abrams, and the use of the Universal lot for filming as well as commenting on the crewmembers who were paid at industry standard rates. He later explained that executives at CBS Video wanted <b>to</b> <b>licence</b> [...] "World Enough and Time" [...] and include it on a Star Trek Blu-ray but they could not convince the chief executive.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, for {{the first}} time in its 53-year history, the event was held outside London, in Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre (NEC). For the first time, tickets for the event were made {{available}} to the public, and 3,000 were sold in the first hour. That year, Adrian Chiles joined the show and co-presented alongside Barker and Lineker for two years. The 2007 ceremony was the first of a two-year sponsorship deal with Britvic's brand Robinsons, and the capacity of the NEC was increased from 5,000 to 8,000. The event sold out, but the sponsorship deal was shortened to one year after complaints by ITV and RadioCentre caused the BBC Trust to rule in [...] that [...] "Editorial Guidelines were breached and the editorial integrity of the BBC compromised by giving the impression <b>to</b> <b>licence</b> fee payers via Sports Personality of the Year that part of a BBC service had been sponsored." [...] They decided that the 2008 awards should not be broadcast as a sponsored event, and no new sponsorship deal was negotiated after the Britvic deal expired. In , the BBC announced that the 2008 Sports Personality of the Year event would be held at the Echo Arena, Liverpool. One reason for the move to Liverpool was to allow greater numbers to view the show live, as the 10,600-seater venue in Liverpool had a bigger capacity than the NEC. That year Jake Humphrey replaced Chiles as co-presenter. The 2009 show was rumoured to be held in either Cardiff or Glasgow. However, it was announced on [...] 2009 that the show would be staged at the Sheffield Arena.|$|E

2500|$|The {{problem was}} that those same privateers in peacetime were often engaged in acts of pure piracy or smuggling, which they {{continued}} in war but {{in the name of}} the King! [...] Young would have got on better with the locals if he had turned a [...] "Nelsonian blind eye." [...] Young felt however that he had to stamp on them as apart from anything else he was finding it next to impossible to recruit local seamen and he feared desertion from his own ships to the better conditions and lure of money of the privateers. Further the privateers were all unlicensed so the navy had no control over them at all. The dispute was finally resolved when the local governors were empowered <b>to</b> <b>licence</b> privateers, which brought some limited measure of control. In return the legal proceedings against James and his officers were dropped.|$|E
60|$|These {{arrangements}} made, Richard {{marched to}} meet Philippe Auguste at Vezelai, and {{agree on the}} regulations for the discipline of their host. If rules could have kept men in order, these were strict enough, forbidding all gaming, all foul language, all disputing, and all approach <b>to</b> <b>licence,</b> and ordering all acquisitions to be equally divided; but with a prince whose violent temper broke through all restraint, there was little hope of their observance.

60|$|All great movements, every {{vigorous}} impulse that {{a community}} may feel, become perverted and distorted as time passes, {{and the atmosphere}} of the earth seems fatal to the noble aspirations of its peoples. A wide humanitarian sympathy in a nation easily degenerates into hysteria. A military spirit tends towards brutality. Liberty leads <b>to</b> <b>licence,</b> restraint to tyranny. The pride of race is distended to blustering arrogance. The fear of God produces bigotry and superstition. There appears no exception to the mournful rule, and the best efforts of men, however glorious their early results, have dismal endings, like plants which shoot and bud and put forth beautiful flowers, and then grow rank and coarse and are withered by the winter. It is only when we reflect that the decay gives birth to fresh life, and that new enthusiasms spring up to take the places of those that die, as the acorn is nourished by the dead leaves of the oak, the hope strengthens that {{the rise and fall of}} men and their movements are only the changing foliage of the ever-growing tree of life, while underneath a greater evolution goes on continually.|$|E

6000|$|Sir Henry Craik, {{in a note}} to his reprint of this tract ("Selections from Swift," [...] Oxford, 1893, vol. ii. p. 42), {{agrees with}} Scott as to the motive which urged Swift in writing it. [...] "In this later tract," [...] he says, [...] "Swift makes no attempt to cloak his enmity; and he boldly assumes the {{character}} of a Whig as the propounder of those atheistical absurdities, which he wished, as a useful political move, but without any scrupulous regard to fairness, to represent as {{part and parcel of the}} tenets of that party." [...] "What gave colour," [...] says Scott, [...] "though only a colour, to his charge was, that Toland, Tindal, Collins, and most of those who carried <b>to</b> <b>licence</b> their abhorrence of Church-government, were naturally enough enrolled among that party in politics who professed most attachment to freedom of sentiment." [...] It must not, however, be forgotten, that Swift's attachment to his Church, as it influenced him against the Whigs, would naturally influence him against the deistical writers also, and that he must be credited, to that extent, with honesty of purpose. That these writers were Whigs was, if one may so put it, an accident, of which it would have been more than a human act for Swift not to take advantage, for party purposes.|$|E
60|$|There {{is reason}} indeed to think, that, after the Revolution, Dryden's taste was {{improved}} in this, as {{in some other}} respects. In his translation of Juvenal, for example, the satire against women, coarse as it is, is considerably refined and softened from the grossness of the Latin poet; who has, however, been lately favoured by a still more elegant, and (excepting perhaps one or two passages) an equally spirited translation, by Mr. Gifford of London. Yet, admitting this apology for Dryden as fully as we dare, from the numerous specimens of indelicacy even in his later translations, we are induced to judge it fortunate that Homer was reserved for a poet who had not known the age of Charles II.; and whose inaccuracies and injudicious decorations may be pardoned, even by the scholar, when he considers the probability, that Dryden might have slipped into the opposite extreme, by converting rude simplicity into indecency or vulgarity. The Æneid, on the other hand, if it restrained Dryden's poetry to a correct, steady, and even flight, if it damped his energy by its regularity, and fettered his excursive imagination by the sobriety of its decorum, had the corresponding advantage of holding forth to the translator no temptation <b>to</b> <b>licence,</b> and no apology for negligence. Where the fervency of genius is required, Dryden has usually equalled his original; where peculiar elegance and exact propriety is demanded, his version may be sometimes found flat and inaccurate, but the mastering spirit of Virgil prevails, and it is never disgusting or indelicate. Of all the classical translations we can boast, none is so acceptable to the class of readers, to whom the learned languages are a clasped book and a sealed fountain. And surely it is no moderate praise to say, that a work is universally pleasing to those for whose use it is principally intended, and to whom only it is absolutely indispensable.|$|E
