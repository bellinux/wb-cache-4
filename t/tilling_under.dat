Since nitrogen fertilizers encourage dense leafy growth, nitrogen should be applied at precise rates, less than 70 pounds per acre, to control decrease severity. Crop rotation with non-host plants is another way to keep mildew infection to a minimum, however the aerial nature of conidia and ascospore dispersal makes it of limited use. Wheat powdery mildew can also be controlled by eliminating the presence of volunteer wheat in agricultural fields as well as <b>tilling</b> <b>under</b> crop residues.|$|E

The plant height was from 105, 48 to 100, 38 cm. And the size of the of the corncobvaried from 25, 05 to 23, 81 cm. Fort these two parameters the averages were less than the ones reported for the same variety with the transplant system with 11 O and 29 cm. respectively. A better control for the three tested types of weeds was observed (Poaceas, cyperaceous and wide lea() with the carboxipirimidinil herbicide; However, the group of poaceas are controlled in a more efficient way for the oxadiargyl in its three dose. The performed linear analysis demonstrated an inversely relation among the number of the entire weeds and the yield.
