5|$|The Third Test of the 1948 Ashes {{series was}} one of five Tests in a cricket series between teams {{representing}} Australia and England. The match was played at Old Trafford in Manchester from 8–13 July, with a rest day on 11 July. The match was drawn after {{the whole of the}} fourth day and {{the first half of the}} fifth day was washed out due to rain; England had the upper hand before the weather intervened. The draw maintained Australia's 2–0 lead in the series, which was established through victories in the first <b>two</b> <b>Tests.</b> As Australia were the holders of The Ashes, the draw meant that England could do no better than level the series 2–2 by winning the last <b>two</b> <b>Tests,</b> and thus Australia retained The Ashes.|$|E

Buttler again played for England in the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 and was a regular fixture in the limited-overs squad throughout the year.

5|$|After the disappointments of the Bodyline series, Ponsford {{returned}} to domestic cricket in 1933–34, scoring 606 runs {{at an average}} of 50.50.

5|$|As England had {{a strong}} batting lineup, Bradman wanted a large range of {{specialist}} bowlers in the Tests, and this was made possible as his preferred bowlers were skillful with the bat. Australia's bowling line-up consisted of Miller, McCool (leg spin), Johnson (off spin), Lindwall, George Tribe (both left arm orthodox and unorthodox) and Toshack. The only deviations were Lindwall missing one Test due to chickenpox, and leg spinner Dooland replacing left-arm spinner Tribe in <b>two</b> <b>Tests.</b>|$|E
