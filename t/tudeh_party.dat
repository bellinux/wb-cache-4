Even though Jews comprised less than 2 percent of Iranian population, almost {{fifty percent of the}} members of the <b>Tudeh</b> <b>party</b> were Jewish. <b>Tudeh</b> <b>party</b> was the only party among the Iranian political parties that accepted Jews with open arms. Most writers for publications of the <b>Tudeh</b> <b>party</b> were Jewish. Furthermore, many Iranian Jews viewed communism as a Jewish movement since many leading members of the communist revolution in Russia were Jewish and were looked upon favorably by Persian Jews.|$|E
25|$|Bijan Jazani {{was born}} to Hossien Jazani (حسین جزنی) and Alamtaj Kalantari Nazari (عالمتاج کلانتری نظری). His parent's family began {{participating}} in the <b>Tudeh</b> <b>party</b> {{during a period of}} political freedom that started from the exile of Reza Shah until the overthrow of Mohammed Mossadegh. The children of these two families became attracted to and then joined the Tudeh youth party. Their activities in the party grew and later gained important responsibilities.

50|$|As the {{movement}} to nationalize Iran's oil resources strengthened, Abolhassan Zia-Zarifi gained prominence as a leftist student organizer and writer, often at odds with other student groups, including the liberal Iran Party as well as religious organizations. Abolhassan Zia-Zarifi described in several places his increasing disenchantment with the <b>Tudeh</b> <b>Party's</b> blind and misguided following of Soviet Russia's interests. In 1952 Abolhassan Zia-Zarifi was sentenced to internal exile for his political activity, but the verdict was delayed, and ultimately rejected.|$|R

5000|$|The Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and {{his family}} left Iran and escaped harm, but {{hundreds}} of {{former members of the}} overthrown monarchy and military met their end in firing squads, with exiled critics complaining of [...] "secrecy, vagueness of the charges, the absence of defense lawyers or juries", or the opportunity of the accused [...] "to defend themselves." [...] In later years these were followed in larger numbers by the erstwhile revolutionary allies of Khomeini's movement—Marxists and socialists, mostly university students—who opposed the theocratic regime. Following the 1981 Hafte Tir bombing, Ayatollah Khomeini declared the Mojahedin and anyone violently opposed to the government, [...] "enemies of God" [...] and pursued a mass campaign against members of the Mojahedin, Fadaiyan, and <b>Tudeh</b> <b>parties</b> as well as their families, close friends, and even anyone who was accused of counterrevolutionary behavior.|$|R
25|$|An {{immediate}} {{consequence of}} the coup d'état was the suppression of all republicanist political dissent, especially the liberal and nationalist opposition umbrella group National Front {{as well as the}} (Communist) <b>Tudeh</b> <b>party,</b> and concentration of political power in the Shah and his courtiers.|$|E
25|$|On 13 September 1943 the Allies {{reassured}} the Iranians {{that all}} foreign troops would leave by 2 March 1946. At the time, the <b>Tudeh</b> <b>Party</b> of Iran, a communist party {{that was already}} influential and had parliamentary representation, was becoming increasingly militant, especially in the North. This promoted actions {{from the side of}} the government, including attempts of the Iranian armed forces to restore order in the Northern provinces. While the Tudeh headquarters in Tehran were occupied and the Isfahan branch crushed, the Soviet troops present in the Northern parts of the country prevented the Iranian forces from entering. Thus, by November 1945 Azerbaijan had become an autonomous state helped by the <b>Tudeh</b> <b>party.</b> This puppet government of the Soviet Union only lasted until November 1946..|$|E
25|$|Jazani, after {{release from}} prison with all his power began the {{development}} and organization of his movement. In spring of 1966, Hassan Zia-Zarifi was added to group and with his recommendation united the organization with the Razm Avaran organization. Razm Avaran was organized by Abbass Sourky in 1959 and its members {{in the years before}} 1953 were members of the <b>Tudeh</b> <b>party</b> and until February 15, 1960, when for promotion and circulation of the party in universities were arrested supported the ideologies of the <b>Tudeh</b> <b>party.</b> But in 1964, when Sourky again organized Razm Avaran, not only did he not want to associate with the <b>Tudeh</b> <b>party</b> but supported the ideology of the Communist Party of China. The recommendation of Hassan Zia-Zarifi, due to the characteristics of Sourky such as inexperience, crowded work, and his past affiliations that led to him being arrested, caused the central authority of the group to be uninterested with this prospect. But, due to internal problems such as impatience of members of the long process of development, which showed when Keyoumars Ezadi left the group, led to the decision to negotiations between the two groups. Even though in the negotiations between Jazani, Zarifi, and Saeed Kalantari Nazari by Sourky and Zarar Zahedian there were major uncertainty to Sourky had been developed by Jazani; the prospect of adding 120 ready members and a large number of explosives and artillery finally led to the merger of the Razm Avaran group with the Jazani group in fall 1966.|$|E
25|$|By 1953, {{economic}} tensions {{caused by}} the British embargo and political turmoil began to take a major toll upon Mossadegh's popularity and political power. The people were increasingly blaming him for {{the economic and political}} crisis. Political violence was becoming widespread in the form of street clashes between rival political groups. Mossadegh was losing popularity and support among the working class which had been his strongest supporters. As he lost support, he became more autocratic. As early as August 1952, he began to rely on emergency powers to rule, generating controversy among his supporters. After an assassination attempt upon one of his cabinet ministers and himself, he ordered the jailing of dozens of his political opponents. This act created widespread anger among much of the general public, and led to accusations that Mossadegh was becoming a dictator. The <b>Tudeh</b> <b>party's</b> unofficial alliance with Mossadegh led to fears of communism, and increasingly it was the communists who were taking part in pro-Mossadegh rallies, and attacking opponents.|$|R
50|$|In the 1940s, Tavallali was prolific. Not {{only did}} he write poetry but also {{political}} commentary for publication in the journals of Shiraz and Tehran. During the period of Russian occupation of Iran (1941 - 1946), Tavallali joined the local communist <b>party,</b> the <b>Tudeh</b> (Mass) <b>party.</b> He published articles in the journals Sourouch in Shiraz and Korshide Iran and Iranema in Teheran. In 1946, a compilation of his articles was published under the title, Al-Tafasil.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a second}} memo, the author attacks the {{character}} of Mossadeq, alleging that his claim of being the [...] "Savior of Iran" [...] is inconsistent with this actions. The author alleges Premier Mossadeq used money received from landowners to undermine those who helped him in the past. The memo notes Mossadeq {{does not want to}} save Iran, but rather wants to save the [...] "dictatorship" [...] of Iran by its alliance to the <b>Tudeh</b> Communist <b>Party.</b>|$|R
25|$|As part of that, the CIA {{organized}} anti-Communist guerrillas {{to fight}} the <b>Tudeh</b> <b>Party</b> if they seized power in the chaos of Operation Ajax. Released National Security Archive documents showed that Undersecretary of State Walter Bedell Smith reported that the CIA had agreed with Qashqai tribal leaders, in south Iran, to establish a clandestine safe haven from which U.S.-funded guerrillas and spies could operate.|$|E
25|$|Starting on 19 July 1988 {{and lasting}} {{about five months}} the {{government}} systematically executed thousands of political prisoners across Iran. This is {{commonly referred to as}} the 1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners or the 1988 Iranian Massacre. The main target was the membership of the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI), although a lesser number of political prisoners from other leftist groups were also included such as the <b>Tudeh</b> <b>Party</b> of Iran (Communist Party). Estimates of the number executed vary from 1,400 to 30,000.|$|E
25|$|Worried about Britain's other {{interests}} in Iran, and (thanks to the <b>Tudeh</b> <b>party)</b> believing that Iran's nationalism {{was really a}} Soviet-backed plot, Britain persuaded US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles that Iran was falling to the Soviets—effectively exploiting the American Cold War mindset. Since President Harry S. Truman was busy fighting a war in Korea, he did not agree {{to overthrow the government}} of Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh. However, in 1953, when Dwight D. Eisenhower became president, the UK convinced the U.S. to undertake a joint coup d'état.|$|E
5000|$|The Islamic Republic has not escaped popular {{opposition}} in the past. During the 1980s, the Marxist-Islamist, Mojahedin Khalq was instrumental in opposing Ayatollah Khomeini through large protests and bombings against politicians such as Mohammad-Ali Rajai, Shahid Beheshti, and Khamenei himself, who escaped an assassination attempt that left his right arm paralyzed. Following the 1981 Hafte Tir bombing, Ayatollah Khomeini declared the Mojahedin and anyone opposed to the Islamic republic, [...] "enemies of god" [...] and pursued a mass campaign of torture, rape, and execution against members of the Mojahedin, Fadaiyan, and <b>Tudeh</b> <b>parties</b> {{as well as their}} families, close friends, and even anyone who was accused of insufficient Islamic behavior, resulting in the deaths of thousands of Iranians who were usually tried in secret kangaroo courts run by hard line clerics. Following the failed Operation Mersad in 1988, Khomeini ordered all prisons to execute those still in captivity, resulting in an estimated 30,000 dead. Since then, no organized opposition has surfaced in Iran and following this experience, the Iranian Government usually employs heavy handed tactics to marginalize any attempt at regime removal and usually justifies this with the [...] "enemy of god" [...] classification.|$|R
5000|$|As the Cold War intensified, oil {{negotiations}} stalled, and the Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower replaced Democratic President Harry S. Truman, the United States helped destabilize Mosaddeq on {{the theory}} that [...] "rising internal tensions and continued deterioration ... might lead to a breakdown of government authority and open the way for at least a gradual assumption of control" [...] by Iran's well organized <b>Tudeh</b> communist <b>party.</b> [...] In spring and summer 1953, the United States and Britain, through a covert operation of the CIA called Operation Ajax, conducted from the American Embassy in Tehran, helped organize a coup d'état to overthrow the Mossadeq government. The operation initially failed, and the Shah fled to Italy, but a second attempt succeeded, and Mosaddeq was imprisoned.|$|R
50|$|From the 1940s {{through the}} 1960s, Communists and Islamists {{sometimes}} joined forces in opposing colonialism and seeking national independence. The <b>Tudeh</b> (Iranian Communist <b>party)</b> was {{allied with the}} Islamists in their ultimately successful rebellion against the Shah in 1979, although after the Shah was overthrown, the Islamists turned on their one-time allies. However, the MEK, an exiled communist party which opposes the Islamic Republic still have some power in their headquarters in Camp Ashraf.|$|R
25|$|During {{the three}} years of occupation, Joseph Stalin had {{expanded}} Soviet political influence in Azerbaijan and Iranian Kurdistan in northwestern Iran, {{as well as in}} Iran founding the communist <b>Tudeh</b> <b>Party</b> of Iran. The Soviets had attempted during their occupation to stir tensions between the tenant-farmers and the landlords (known in Iran as arbabs). On 12 December 1945, after weeks of violent clashes a Soviet-backed separatist People's Republic of Azerbaijan was founded. The Kurdish People's Republic was also established in late 1945. Iranian government troops sent to reestablish control were blocked by Red Army units.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, the Central Intelligence Agency and Britain's Secret Intelligence Service {{were ordered to}} {{overthrow}} the government of Iran, Prime Minister Mohammed Mosaddeq, and re-install deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. This event was called Operation Ajax. The senior CIA officer was Kermit Roosevelt, Jr., the grandson of American president Theodore Roosevelt. The operation utilized all of SAD's components to include political action, covert influence and paramilitary operations. The paramilitary component included training anti-Communist guerrillas to fight the <b>Tudeh</b> <b>Party</b> if they seized power in the chaos of Operation Ajax. Although a significant tactical/operational success, Operation Ajax is considered very controversial with many critics.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{thereafter}} on August 19 {{a successful}} coup was headed by retired army general Fazlollah Zahedi, {{organized by the}} United States (CIA) with the active support of the British (MI6) (known as Operation Ajax and Operation Boot to the respective agencies). The coup—with a black propaganda campaign designed to turn the population against Mosaddeq—forced Mosaddeq from office. Mosaddeq was arrested and tried for treason. Found guilty, his sentence reduced to house arrest on his family estate while his foreign minister, Hossein Fatemi, was executed. Zahedi succeeded him as prime minister, and suppressed opposition to the Shah, specifically the National Front and Communist <b>Tudeh</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
50|$|After {{retiring}} from the army, he was named Senator in 1950. Zahedi was appointed Minister of the Interior (1951) in Hossein Ala''s administration, a post he would retain when Dr. Mohammad Mossadegh became Prime Minister. Zahedi actively supported the new government's nationalisation of the oil industry, which had previously been owned by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, now BP. However, he was at odds with Mossadegh over his increasing tolerance for the outlawed communist <b>party</b> <b>Tudeh,</b> which had boldly demonstrated in favor of nationalisation. Both of these moves antagonised the Western Powers, especially the United Kingdom and the United States. Zahedi was dismissed by Prime Minister Mossadegh after a bloody crackdown on pro-nationalization protesters in mid-1951 in which 20 {{people were killed and}} 2000 wounded.|$|R
50|$|As the Iranians {{moved toward}} seizing the reserves, the Truman {{administration}} attempted to mediate. Later, the Eisenhower administration, convinced that Iran was developing communist ties, used the CIA, joining forces with Iran's military leaders to overthrow Iran's government. Mossadegh {{drew on the}} <b>Tudeh,</b> the Communist <b>Party</b> of Iran, {{for much of his}} support. However, by 1953 the party had begun to criticize him as a U.S. puppet state. Since the Tudeh was the strongest Communist party in the Middle East, the Eisenhower administration cited a potential communist takeover in the Middle East to justify intervention. Mossadeq invoked the communist threat to gain American concessions. The premier perceived that as Iran's economy suffered and fears of communist takeover gripped the U.S. government, the U.S. would abandon Britain and rescue him from his predicament.|$|R
5000|$|The {{shock for}} the Iranian Kurdish {{national}} movement {{came with the}} eruption of the First Kurdish-Iraqi War in neighboring Iraq in 1961. [...] When the 1958‐61 rapprochement in Iraq collapsed, the KDP‐Iran supported Iraqi Kurds; in the process, the leadership and subsequent social orientation of both Iran’s and Iraq’s Kurdish Democratic Parties turned conservative. Facing a newly consolidated Iraqi government by 1965, Mulla Mustafa turned against his former military allies and KDP‐I supporters and came to {{an agreement with the}} Shah, that called for him to “restrain” KDP‐I activities against the Iranian government. Mullah Mustafa went further, “subordinating the struggle in Iran to that in Iraq” and “warning that KDP‐Iran militants would not be tolerated in Iraqi Kurdistan”. The result of this was that the conservative leadership of the KDP‐Iran was ousted and new, mostly former Iranian <b>Tudeh</b> (Communist) <b>Party</b> leaders took over the party’s leadership. They formed a Revolutionary Committee and declared their support for sporadic peasant uprisings against the National Police around Mahabad and Urumiya. Lacking a significant social base, this new leadership was quickly crushed: even though the KDPI's forces managed to inflict serious losses on the Iranian army, they failed due to lack of logistical support. Within months, eight of the eleven members of the Revolutionary Committee had been murdered by Iranian soldiers, and the movement lasted less than eighteen months. Over 40 KDPI party members were killed and their bodies handed over by Mullah Mustafa's men to the Iranian authorities.|$|R
25|$|Having {{obtained}} the Shah's concurrence, the CIA executed the coup. Farmans (royal decrees) dismissing Mosaddegh and appointing General Fazlollah Zahedi (a loyalist {{who had helped}} Reza Shah reunify Iran decades earlier) were drawn up by the coup plotters and signed by the Shah. Having signed the decrees and delivered them to General Zahedi, he and Queen Soraya departed for a week-long vacation in northern Iran. On Saturday 15 August, Colonel Nematollah Nassiri, {{the commander of the}} Imperial Guard, delivered to Mosaddegh a firman from the Shah dismissing him. Mosaddegh, who had been warned of the plot, probably by the Communist <b>Tudeh</b> <b>Party,</b> rejected the firman and had Nassiri arrested. Mosaddegh argued at his trial after the coup that under the Iranian constitutional monarchy, the Shah had no constitutional right to issue an order for the elected Prime Minister's dismissal without Parliament's consent. However, the constitution at the time did allow for such an action, which Mossadegh considered unfair. The action was publicized within Iran by the CIA and in the United States by The New York Times. Mossadegh's supporters (millions of National Front supporters as well as members of the <b>Tudeh</b> <b>Party)</b> took to the streets in violent protests. Following the failed coup attempt, the Shah, accompanied by his second wife Soraya Esfandiary-Bakhtiari and Aboul Fath Atabay fled to Baghdad. Arriving unannounced, the Shah asked for permission for himself and his consort to stay in Baghdad for a few days before continuing on to Europe. After high-level Government consultations, they were escorted to the White House, the Iraqi Government's guest house, before flying to Italy in a plane flown by Mohammad Khatami.|$|E
500|$|The United States {{made use}} of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) {{to do away with}} a string of unfriendly Third World governments and to support allied ones. In 1953, President Eisenhower's CIA {{implemented}} Operation Ajax, a covert operation aimed at the overthrow of the Iranian prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh. The popularly elected and non-aligned Mosaddegh had been a Middle Eastern nemesis of Britain since nationalizing the British-owned Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in 1951. Winston Churchill told the United States that Mosaddegh was [...] "increasingly turning towards communism." [...] The pro-Western shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, assumed control as an autocratic monarch. The shah's policies included the banning of the communist <b>Tudeh</b> <b>Party</b> of Iran and general suppression of political dissent by SAVAK, the shah's domestic security and intelligence agency.|$|E

5000|$|Twenty-six {{years after}} the Mossadeq coup, Kermit Roosevelt took {{the unusual step of}} writing a book about how he and the CIA carried out the operation. He called his book Countercoup to press home the idea that the CIA coup was staged only to prevent a {{takeover}} of power by the Iranian Communist <b>Party</b> (<b>Tudeh)</b> closely backed by the Soviet Union, and to imply that the exile of the Shah constituted the initial coup, and that he was merely restoring the rightful leader to power. According to Roosevelt, he slipped across the border under his CIA cover as [...] "James Lockridge" [...] on June 19, 1953, was put up in Tehran in a place rented by British intelligence, and as Mr. Lockridge, became a regular at the Turkish Embassy where he played tennis and golf, allegedly scoring a hole in one during a game with the Turkish Ambassador; no one suspected that Mr. Lockridge was the grandson of the 26th US President, though at times he came close to blowing his cover.|$|R
5000|$|However, the Iranians rebuffed Soviet {{offers of}} {{friendship}} and by 1982 they also had {{the upper hand in}} the war. They decided to push on into Iraq and overthrow Saddam Hussein. This led to a change in Soviet policy from Summer, 1982. The Soviets did not like the implications of an Iranian victory, fearing Tehran would go on to export Islamic revolution elsewhere in the world. Although officially still neutral, the USSR gradually increased economic and military support to Iraq to stop the collapse of Saddam. The Soviets had a commitment not to let an ally be overthrown and support for Iraq also played well with many Arab nations (the Soviets finally achieved diplomatic relations with Oman and the UAE and an agreement to supply arms to Kuwait). In 1983, the actions of the Iranians became increasingly anti-Soviet. The authorities cracked down on the Moscow-backed Iranian communist <b>party,</b> <b>Tudeh,</b> and then expelled 18 Soviet diplomats. The Soviets were also keen to counterbalance Iraq's increasingly friendly relations with the West by boosting military aid to Saddam. Iraq became [...] "the largest recipient of Soviet-bloc military aid among the countries of the Third World". In 1984, Iraq officially established diplomatic relations with the USA. This, combined with the outbreak of the [...] "tanker war" [...] (Iranian-Saudi confrontation over oil tankers in the Persian Gulf) opened the worrying prospect for the Soviets of an increased US presence in the region. The USSR responded with yet more military aid to Saddam.|$|R

2500|$|This period had a {{major impact}} in the future {{political}} life of Jazani. He lived in a household whose members had a professional role in the <b>Tudeh</b> <b>party.</b> During this time his mother expanded her activities in the women's <b>Tudeh</b> <b>party</b> and Jazani alongside his uncle, who was 2 years older than he was, joined the Tudeh Youth Organization in the year 1948, {{at the age of}} 10. After the <b>Tudeh</b> <b>party</b> became illegal on February 4, 1949, Jazani continued participation in the youth party. He was then chosen as the messenger of the youth organization because of his young age and his family background. But the hidden activities of the <b>Tudeh</b> <b>party</b> and the affiliated organizations did not last long and from 1951, the activities slowly became semi-transparent. In addition to this, the leaders of the Tudeh and the youth organization created the [...] "Iranians in favor of Peace", [...] "National Organization in the Struggle against the Anglo-Iranian Oil Corporation", [...] "Democratic Youth Organizations", and the [...] "Student Organization of Tehran". Jazani began his activities in the [...] "Student Organization of Tehran" [...] in 1951–1952 and was responsible for a small group. In 1953 he became semi-responsible for this organization. He was also active in the circulation and sale of student newspapers and began a gym in 1951, which was beneficial to the students of the community and a place for recruiting members in the youth organization.|$|E
2500|$|Marxist groups – {{primarily}} the communist <b>Tudeh</b> <b>Party</b> of Iran and the Fedaian guerrillas – had been weakened considerably by government repression. Despite this the guerrillas did help {{play an important}} part in the final February 1979 overthrow ...|$|E

2500|$|Jazani and his {{followers}} slowly moved from the <b>Tudeh</b> <b>party</b> to the student and national front organizations because of their interest in the guerilla movement in Latin America.

2500|$|More {{popular than}} ever, a greatly {{strengthened}} Mosaddegh convinced parliament to grant him emergency powers {{for six months}} to [...] "decree any law he felt necessary for obtaining not only financial solvency, but also electoral, judicial, and educational reforms".

Kashani's Islamic scholars, {{as well as the}} <b>Tudeh</b> <b>Party,</b> proved to be two of Mosaddegh's key political allies, although relations with both were often strained.|$|E
2500|$|Historians {{disagree}} on what motivated the United States {{to change its}} policy towards Iran and stage the coup.
