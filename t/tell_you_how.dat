5|$|Nixon: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm {{talking to}} you by {{telephone}} from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly {{has to be the}} most historic telephone call ever made. I just can't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> proud we all are of what you've done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for residents to access other remote areas by foot. Most locals can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> many days it would take to walk to most locations within the country. Walking often is the only way for people to get to their local villages anyway, as many local airstrips are in disrepair. The maintenance of airstrips is a Local Level Government responsibility, and many LLGs in the surrounding area are severely underfunded.|$|E
25|$|Moore's {{scenario}} remains untested. Addressing historical developments when DC reissued the work, he noted:Naïveté {{can also}} be detected in my supposition {{that it would take}} something as melodramatic as a near-miss nuclear conflict to nudge Britain towards fascism... The simple fact that much of the historical background of the story proceeds from a predicted Conservative defeat in the 1983 General Election should <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> reliable we were in our roles as Cassandras.|$|E
5000|$|A {{connection}} on a [...] bundle <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> to glue fibers {{together at}} nearby points of [...] It {{starts with a}} continuous symmetry group [...] which acts on the fiber , and then it associates a group element with each infinitesimal path. Group multiplication along any path <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> {{to move from one}} point on the bundle to another, by having the [...] element associated to a path act on the fiber [...]|$|R

25|$|I can’t <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> pleased I was to {{see this}} place again. In a moment one goes over the years; every shrub, every turn, every peep of the house has a little history in it. The weather is {{delightful}} and the place looks beautiful. The trees are all so grown and there a thousand pretty sheltered spots, which near the sea in this season is very pleasant. The birds sing, the flowers blow, and make me for moments forget the world and all the villainy and tyranny going on in it.|$|E
25|$|They {{deprive the}} sinner of his life; I shall truly <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> this is done. The wicked (punishers) remind by (similar) {{punishment}} (their victims) of all sins they had committed {{in a former}} life. Being killed they are thrown into a hell which is full of boiling filth. There they stay eating filth, and they are eaten by vermin. And there is an always crowded, hot place, which men deserve for their great sins, and which is full of misery. (The punishers) put them in shackles, beat their bodies, and torment them (by perforating) their skulls with drills. They cut off the sinner's nose with a razor, they cut off both his ears and lips; they pull out his tongue a span's length and torment (him by piercing it) with sharp pikes. There the sinners dripping (with blood) whine day and night even as the dry leaves of a palm-tree (agitated by the wind). Their blood, matter, and flesh are dropping off while they are roasted, their bodies being besmeared with natron. Have you heard of the large, erected caldron of more than man's size, full of blood and matter, which is extremely heated by a fresh fire, in which blood and matter are boiling? The sinners are thrown into it and boiled there, while they utter horrid cries of 'Agony; they are made to drink molten lead and copper when they are thirsty, and they shriek still more horribly. Those evildoers who have here forfeited their souls' (happiness) {{for the sake of}} small (pleasures), and have been born in the lowest births during hundred thousands of million years will stay in this (hell). Their punishment will be adequate to their deeds. The wicked who have committed crimes will atone for them, deprived of all pleasant and lovely objects, by dwelling in the stinking crowded hell, a scene of pain, which is full of flesh.|$|E
500|$|Martin {{offered the}} {{following}} hint {{as to how}} the series would conclude during a Q at the Guadalajara International Book Fair. [...] "I'm not going to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> I'm going to end my book, but I suspect the overall flavor is going to be as much bittersweet as it is happy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do you {{remember}} that evening in the study?' she asked abruptly. 'We had been talking. I had been <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> I had lived during those five years.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what has}} he been saying?" [...] demanded the aristocratic bully, coolly. [...] "Has he been <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> I had to polish him off for {{insulting}} me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lovely Felicia, the day {{has come}} at last when I may have the {{happiness}} of <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> even the flowers love you and rejoice in your beauty." ...|$|R
500|$|In May 1965, Dylan {{returned}} from his tour of England feeling exhausted and dissatisfied with his material. He told journalist Nat Hentoff: [...] "I was going to quit singing. I was very drained." [...] The singer added, [...] "It's very tiring having other people <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> much they dig you if you yourself don't dig you." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scandal has}} {{affected}} numerous people and organizations associated with Goldschmidt. Many {{people have been}} accused of knowing of the crime, but failing to act accordingly. Debby Kennedy, who worked for Goldschmidt while he was governor, recalled, [...] "I just can't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> many rumors there were about him then." [...] Multnomah County Sheriff Bernie Giusto, who admitted knowing about the abuse, announced his early retirement in February 2008.|$|E
500|$|In 1982, Thompson's {{father died}} as a result of circulatory {{problems}} at the age of 52. The actress has commented that this [...] "tore [...] to pieces", and [...] "I can't begin to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> much I regret his not being around". She added, [...] "At the same time, it's possible that were he still alive I might never have had the space or courage to do what I've done ... I have a definite feeling of inheriting space. And power." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And it chanced so with me,' said Riderhood. 'But I don't mind <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>how.</b> Why should I mind <b>telling</b> <b>you?</b> I'm a Deputy Lock-keeper up the river, and I was {{off duty}} yes'day, and I shall be on to-morrow.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Most {{people find}} it easier to work with gross margin because it {{directly}} <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> much of the sales revenue, or price, is profit. In reference to the two examples above: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sayst thou?" [...] exclaimed the Prince, hastily laying {{aside his}} writing materials. [...] "Fear not, mi Dona, I will return anon and <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> <b>how</b> it is. We are in {{smoother}} water already." ...|$|R
500|$|Matt Groening noted: [...] "I can't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> {{many times}} {{people have come}} up to me and said, 'I know who you based that comic book guy on. It's that comic-book guy right down the block.' And I have to tell them, 'No, it's every comic-bookstore guy in America.'" [...] Cast member Hank Azaria based Comic Book Guy's voice on a student who went by the name [...] "F" [...] and lived in the room next door at his college.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{think most}} of the time when my records come out, people are so much distracted by so much fanfare and {{controversy}} that nobody pays attention to the music. [...] I can't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> painful the idea of singing 'Like a Virgin' or 'Material Girl' (1984) is to me now. I didn't write either of those songs, and wasn't digging very deep then. I also feel more connected emotionally to the music I'm writing now, so it's more of a pleasure to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Some critics {{characterize}} {{his books}} as unoriginal or derivative. A 2009 New York Times article {{said he is}} [...] "hardly the first writer {{to tap into the}} American longing for meaning and success". [...] Sara Nelson, the editor-in-chief of Publishers Weekly, said Tolle's writings have been successful due to surging public interest in books that <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> to be happier, more peaceful and more successful. [...] James Robinson in The Observer called his writings [...] "a mix of pseudo-science, New Age philosophy, and teaching borrowed from established religions".|$|E
6000|$|He {{gathered}} up the cards, and began to shuffle. [...] "Ah, lov'," [...] he sang sentimentally, with a vacant eye {{on the roof of}} the summerhouse, [...] "could I bot <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> <b>how</b> moch----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{remember}} <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> fond I {{always was}} of first nights," [...] she admitted. [...] "Nowadays, naturally, {{we do not}} go to the theatre at all. My mother and I live very quietly." ...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} find out what the chances are of a patient with a {{positive}} or negative test result having or not having the disease, the likelihood ratios (LRs) need to be calculated. The LR incorporates both the sensitivity and specificity of the test and provides an estimate of how much a positive or negative test result changes the chances of having or not having the disease. So a positive LR <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> much more likely patients are to have the disease when the test is positive. The negative LR <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> much less likely patients are to have the disease when the test is negative.|$|R
500|$|When Austen was twenty, Tom Lefroy, a neighbour, visited Steventon from December 1795 to January 1796. He {{had just}} {{finished}} a university degree and was moving to London for training as a barrister. Lefroy and Austen would have been introduced at a ball or other neighbourhood social gathering, {{and it is clear}} from Austen's letters to Cassandra that they spent considerable time together: [...] "I am almost afraid to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> my Irish friend and I behaved. Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together." ...|$|E
500|$|Flight attendants Lisa E. Wick and Lonnie Trumbull, both 20, were bludgeoned with a {{piece of}} lumber as they slept in their {{basement}} apartment in Seattle's Queen Anne Hill district on June 23, 1966 near the Safeway store where Bundy worked at the time, and where the women regularly shopped. Trumbull died. In retrospect, Keppel noted many similarities to the Chi Omega crime scene. Wick, who suffered permanent memory loss {{as a result of the}} attack, later contacted Ann Rule: [...] "I know that it was Ted Bundy who did that to us," [...] she wrote, [...] "but I can't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> I know." [...] In the absence of incriminating evidence, Bundy's involvement remains speculative.|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1965, after {{returning}} from the tour of England documented in the film Dont Look Back, Dylan was unhappy with the public's expectations of him, {{as well as the}} direction his career was taking, and seriously considered quitting the music business. In a 1966 Playboy interview, he described his dissatisfaction: [...] "Last spring, I guess I was going to quit singing. I was very drained, and the way things were going, it was a very draggy situation... But 'Like a Rolling Stone' changed it all. I mean it was something that I myself could dig. It's very tiring having other people <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> much they dig you if you yourself don't dig you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I cannot {{let you go}} from us, Charley,' began Mrs. Woodward, 'without <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> deep a sorrow it {{has been}} {{to me to be}} so long without seeing you. I know you have thought me very ungrateful.' ...|$|R
5000|$|HISS. Would <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me <b>how</b> <b>you</b> {{reconcile}} your negative answers {{with this}} affirmative answer? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is the same!" [...] said Horace. [...] "Lady Janet, we {{are really}} {{interested}} in this. <b>You</b> remember my <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> I first met with Grace? And you have heard more about it since, no doubt, from Grace herself?" ...|$|R
500|$|After the war, Lilly {{remained}} in the South to begin a new business venture. Lilly and his business partner leased a [...] cotton plantation in Mississippi. Lilly traveled to Greencastle, Indiana, and returned with his wife, Emily, his sister, Anna Wesley Lilly, and son, Josiah. Shortly after the move the entire family was stricken with a mosquito-borne disease, probably malaria, that was common in the region at that time. Although the others recovered, Emily died on August 20, 1866, eight months pregnant with a second son, who was stillborn. The death devastated Lilly; {{he wrote to his}} family, [...] "I can hardly <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> it glares at me...it's a bitter, bitter truth... Emily is indeed dead." [...] Lilly abandoned the farm and returned to Indiana. The plantation fell into disrepair and a drought caused its cotton crop to fail. Lilly's business partner, unable to maintain the plantation because of the drought, disappeared with the venture's remaining cash. Lilly was forced to file for bankruptcy in 1868.|$|E
500|$|Because of {{his many}} {{absences}} from home, on parliamentary and other business, Richard Cobden was a somewhat remote figure to his daughters, although his letters indicate that he felt warmly towards them and that he wished to direct their political education. In later years they would all acknowledge his influence over their ideas. Both parents impressed on the girls their responsibilities for the poor in the local community; Jane Cobden's 1864 diary records visits to homes and workhouses. She and her younger sister Anne, at the ages of 12 and 10 respectively, taught classes in the local village school. [...] The girls were encouraged by their father to contribute what money they possessed to relieve local poverty: [...] "Do not keep the money... as you have now made up your minds {{to give it to}} poor sufferers, let your own neighbours have it. Your Mama will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> to dispose of it, and tell me all about it".|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Yori and her user, Dr. Lora Baines, {{do not appear}} in the sequel, even though the film refers to Alan Bradley being married to Lora. Fans have lobbied for actress Cindy Morgan to be in the film with active campaigns online, such as [...] "Yori Lives" [...] on Facebook, which is independent of Morgan herself. [...] "All I know is what I'm seeing online," [...] Morgan said. [...] "I am so thrilled and touched and excited about the fan reaction and about people talking about the first one and how it relates to the second one. I can't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> warm a feeling I get from that. It just means so much." [...] No one from Tron: Legacy had contacted Morgan, and she did not directly speak with anyone from the sequel's cast and crew. As Dr. Lora Baines, Cindy Morgan had appeared with Bruce Boxleitner (as Alan Bradley) at the Encom Press Conference in San Francisco, April 2, 2010.|$|E
6000|$|... "I must--I must. When I {{knew you}} were going to live I vowed that I would <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> as soon as you were well--that I wouldn't go on {{accepting}} your friendship and companionship without <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> unworthy I was of it. And I've been so afraid--it would turn you against me." ...|$|R
6000|$|Rod. Wilt thou let me guide thee to yonder tower? I fear to <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> here, and old Norna {{is there}} waiting for thee. Come, love, for thy Louis's sake, dare yet a little more, and I will <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> <b>how</b> thou canst serve me. Wilt thou not put thy faith in me, Leonore? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{what is the}} matter, Robert?" [...] cried Laura, {{with the}} swift {{perception}} of womanhood. [...] "You are flushed, and your eyes are shining, and really you look quite handsome. Raffles has been <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> something! What was it? Oh, I know! He has been <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> he made his money. Hasn't he, now?" ...|$|R
