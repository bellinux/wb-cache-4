5|$|Inspired by the Halo {{video game}} series, Troy Hurtubise, {{known for his}} anti-bear suits, {{developed}} a real counterpart to the MJOLNIR powered assault armor, named the Trojan. <b>The</b> <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> functional and its capabilities were inspired by those present in the video games versions of the armor. The armor's features include a system that purifies air, powered by solar panels located in the helmet, equipment for weapon transportation, a recording system, emergency illumination, and a transponder that can be activated if the wearer is in serious jeopardy. The armor offers protection against attacks with knives, blunt objects, and small explosions and is bulletproof. Hurtubise expressed that {{he is able to}} improve this design for use in the military for a price of 2,000 dollars per piece. Non-functional replicas of the MJOLNIR powered assault armor have also been created by hobbyists; a Spike TV pre-Halo 3 special profiled some of these dedicated fans.|$|E
5|$|The {{palladium}} core in the arc reactor {{that keeps}} Stark alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him, and he cannot find a substitute. Growing increasingly reckless and despondent about his impending death, and {{choosing not to}} tell anyone about his condition, Stark appoints his personal assistant Pepper Potts CEO of Stark Industries, and hires Stark employee Natalie Rushman to replace her as his personal assistant. Stark competes in the Monaco Historic Grand Prix, where he is attacked {{in the middle of}} the race by Vanko, who wields electrified whips. Stark dons his Mark V armor and defeats Vanko, but <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> severely damaged. Vanko explains his intention was to prove to the world that Iron Man is not invincible. Impressed by Vanko's performance, Stark's rival, Justin Hammer, fakes Vanko's death while breaking him out of prison and asks him to build a line of armored suits to upstage Stark. During what he believes is his final birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Mark IV suit. Disgusted, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes dons Stark's Mark II prototype armor and tries to restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, so Rhodes confiscates the Mark II for the U.S. Air Force.|$|E
25|$|Bayonetta: The titular protagonist Bayonetta wears a catsuit that is {{composed}} of her own hair as a medium. <b>The</b> <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> occasionally removed when she is summoning demons to kill powerful angels.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} to be worn over a liquid cooling garment. The inner fabric of <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> gray nylon canvas. <b>The</b> <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> insulated with waffle-textured foil. The outer layer was an off-white satin-weave fabric with orange trim.|$|R
5000|$|... <b>the</b> old <b>suit</b> names <b>were</b> {{attributed}} to <b>the</b> new <b>suits</b> - this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> reason why Portuguese names for <b>suits</b> don't match <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> drawings. In Portuguese, <b>the</b> Hearts <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> called Copas ("cups"), <b>the</b> Spades <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> called Espadas ("swords"), <b>the</b> Diamonds <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> called Ouros ("gold coins"), and <b>the</b> Clubs <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> called Paus ("clubs" [...] or [...] "sticks").|$|R
5000|$|Due {{to being}} made with using wet-suits and latices, <b>the</b> <b>suits</b> <b>were</b> {{incapable}} of sustaining {{long periods of}} time. What happened to each of <b>the</b> <b>suits</b> <b>were</b> as follows: ...|$|R
25|$|Following the {{traditional}} bespoke process, measurements are taken, a basted canvas {{is built around}} the customer, then disassembled and traced onto paper, after which there are two more fittings. <b>The</b> <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> hand-sewn.|$|E
25|$|During descent {{the air in}} <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> {{compressed}} {{and unless}} more is added, the folds may be pressed together so tightly by water pressure that they pinch the skin, which is painful and may cause local bruising. The suit may also become so tight that movement is restricted, particularly in a membrane suit. This problem is managed by suit inflation from a low pressure gas supply.|$|E
25|$|On 28 April 1599 De Vere was sued by {{the widow}} of his tailor for a debt of £500 for {{services}} rendered some two decades earlier. De Vere claimed that not only had he paid the debt, but that the tailor had absconded with 'cloth of gold and silver and other stuff' belonging to him, worth £800. The outcome of <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> unknown.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Yastreb <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> {{only used}} once, this {{was during the}} Soyuz 4 and Soyuz 5 docking and crew exchange. <b>The</b> <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> not worn during launch or reentry. During the mission both cosmonauts {{experienced}} problems with <b>the</b> <b>suit.</b>|$|R
25|$|In Beyond Castle Wolfenstein, {{the goal}} of the game is to {{infiltrate}} Hitler's bunker and kill Hitler and his senior staff with a bomb, similar to the July 20 plot. Wolfenstein 3D features Hitler as the final boss of Episode 3. He battles first wearing a mechanical battlesuit, then later carries two miniguns after <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> heavily damaged. In addition, the map features Hitler-clones with flamethrowers that can be found before the final battle.|$|E
25|$|The European Initiative, a pro-Israeli group, lodged an itemized legal {{complaint}} with the Belgian Federal Prosecutor's Office and demanded that the top Hamas leadership in Gaza and Damascus be prosecuted for war crimes. The plaintiffs are Israelis who hold Belgian citizenship {{and live in the}} Gaza periphery communities that have been targeted by rockets. <b>The</b> <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> based on the Goldstone Report, as well as on reports by B'Tselem and Amnesty International.|$|E
25|$|In Half-Life, Gordon {{wears the}} Mark IV suit. Later in the game, <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> {{equipped}} with an optional long-jump module so Gordon can leap great distances. It is charged using power modules throughout Black Mesa. In Half-Life 2 Gordon receives the upgraded Mark V suit, which lacks the long-jump module but gains several new abilities. It features a visual zooming capability, limited sprinting, an anti-venom injector, an optional ammo and health counter on the crosshair, and the capability to use Combine power nodes to charge the suit.|$|E

5|$|In July 2004, Ellefson sued Mustaine for $18.5 {{million in}} Manhattan Federal Court. Ellefson alleged that Mustaine short-changed him on profits {{including}} tour merchandise and publishing royalties. <b>The</b> <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> dismissed in 2005, and Mustaine filed a countersuit alleging that Ellefson {{had used the}} band's name in an advertisement for musical equipment; <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> settled out of court.|$|R
25|$|A {{dry suit}} {{functions}} {{by keeping the}} diver dry. <b>The</b> <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> waterproof and sealed so that water cannot penetrate the suit. Special purpose undergarments are usually worn under a dry suit to keep a layer of air between the diver and the suit for thermal insulation. Some divers carry an extra gas bottle dedicated to filling the dry suit, which may contain argon gas, {{because it is a}} better insulator than air. Dry suits should not be inflated with gases containing helium as it is a good thermal conductor.|$|E
25|$|The {{essential}} components {{include a}} shell of watertight material, sufficiently flexible to allow the wearer to function adequately, seals where {{parts of the body}} pass through the suit while in use, and a method of sealing the access opening while <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> worn. Insulation may be provided in part by the suit shell, but is usually largely provided by thermal insulation clothing worn under the suit, which relies to a large extent on trapped air for its insulating properties. An inflation valve with gas supply and dump valve are generally provided, but were not standard on early models.|$|E
25|$|In January 2017, {{a lawsuit}} against Trump was brought by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) and several {{prominent}} legal scholarsincluding Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School, former White House Special Counsel for Ethics and Government Reform Norman L. Eisen, Erwin Chemerinsky of the UC Irvine, and Zephyr Teachout of Fordham University. The lawsuit argues that Trump is {{in violation of the}} Foreign Emoluments Clause of the United States because his hotels, as well as other businesses, are accepting payments from foreign guests. <b>The</b> <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.|$|E
25|$|In January 1964, Connally donated <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> he wore on November 22, 1963 to the Texas National Archives. <b>The</b> <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> {{displayed}} to <b>the</b> public until March 1964. In 2000, the TNA loaned <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> to <b>the</b> National Archives and Records Administration for examination purposes. From October 2013 to February 2014, <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> featured {{as part of}} {{an exhibit}} at the Texas National Archives to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Kennedy assassination.|$|R

50|$|Sakoda filed a {{class action}} lawsuit against WWE, alleging that wrestlers {{suffered}} traumatic brain injuries while wrestling for them and that the company tried to conceal that information. <b>The</b> <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who {{has been involved in}} a number of other lawsuits against WWE. In March 2016, <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> dismissed by Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant.|$|R
25|$|The story follows an International Peacekeeping Force's White Lightning {{team leader}} Matt Coda, as he {{attempts}} to stop a scientist Dr. Kim from conducting unethical genetic engineering research. As the game progresses, the eponymous Kileak is revealed to be an ancient extraterrestrial creature that is the common ancestor of all life on Earth. The player controls an armored SJ 107 assault suit through the series of floor levels within a South Pole observation base. Each floor is connected by an elevator, which the player must find {{in order to proceed}} to the level below. <b>The</b> <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> equipped with various weapons, some of which require the suits battery power to operate.|$|E
25|$|Some {{dry suits}} are {{provided}} with internally attached suspenders which when hooked over the shoulders, will hold the trouser section up when the top part of the suit {{has not yet been}} fully dressed into by the diver, this is also convenient if <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> partly removed between dives for comfort. The suspenders also help to keep the trousers fully lifted if the torso of a membrane suit is a little long to provide enough space for the diver to bend the torso comfortably when in use. If the crotch hangs too low it encumbers the legs when finning, and increases the risk of the feet pulling out of the boots in an inversion.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, Luthor {{has made}} liberal use of kryptonite weapons capable of {{injuring}} Superman and other Kryptonians. Since the Bronze Age, {{he has also}} utilized various battlesuits in many stories. In current continuity, his suit grants him incredible superhuman strength and durability (enough to withstand a succession of nuclear blasts), and is equipped with rocket-boosters that enable him to fly for days on end. Additionally, it generates a powerful invisible energy shield that protects the entire suit from a majority of physical attacks. <b>The</b> <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> also armed with a collapsible kryptonite sword, axe and staff-cannon, along with dual kryptonite energy cannons. Consequently, Luthor has become extremely skilled in close-range combat.|$|E

25|$|When <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> {{being used}} correctly, the bubble inside it is {{relatively}} small, and its movement is not important. The bubble may be large {{for a variety of}} reasons: if a diver has ascended without venting the suit; if the valve supplying gas to dry suit fails in the open position; or if the diver is over-weighted, and extra air has been added to the suit at some point to make the diver neutrally buoyant. The size of the bubble can be minimised by being correctly weighted and venting excess gas from the suit on ascent. Some divers ensure that the bubble remains {{at the top of their}} body by using the buoyancy compensator to counteract any excess weighting, keeping only the minimum gas necessary to avoid squeeze inside the drysuit.|$|E
25|$|Heated {{water in}} the suit forms an active {{insulation}} barrier to heat loss, but the temperature must be regulated within fairly close limits. If the temperature falls below about 32°C, hypothermia can result, and temperatures above 45°C can cause burn injury to the diver. The diver may not notice a gradual change in inlet temperature, {{and in the early}} stages of hypo- or hyperthermia, may not notice the deteriorating condition. <b>The</b> <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> loose fitting to allow unimpeded water flow. This causes a large volume of water (13 to 22 litres) to be held in the suit, which can impede swimming due to the added inertia. When controlled correctly, the hot water suit is safe, comfortable and effective, and allows the diver adequate control of thermal protection, however hot water supply failure can be life-threatening.|$|E
25|$|Wetsuits {{are limited}} {{in their ability to}} {{preserve}} warmth by three factors: the wearer is still exposed to some water, <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> compressed by the ambient pressure, reducing effectiveness at depth, and the insulating neoprene can only be made to a certain thickness before it becomes impractical to don and wear. The thickest commercially available wetsuits are usually 10mm thick. Other common thicknesses are 7mm, 5mm, 3mm, and 1mm. A 1mm suit provides very little warmth and is usually considered a dive skin, rather than a wetsuit. Wetsuits can be made using more than one thickness of neoprene, to put the most thickness where it will be most effective in keeping the diver warm. A similar effect can be achieved by layering wetsuits of different coverage. Some makes of neoprene are softer, lighter and more compressible than others for the same thickness, and are more suitable for wetsuits for non-diving purposes as they will compress and lose their insulating value more quickly under pressure, though they are more comfortable for surface sports because they are more flexible and allow more freedom of movement.|$|E
