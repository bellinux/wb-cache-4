5|$|A {{preparation}} of L-ornithine and L-aspartate (LOLA) {{is used to}} increase the generation of urea through the urea cycle, a metabolic pathway that removes ammonia by <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the neutral substance urea. It may be combined with lactulose and/or rifaximin if these alone are ineffective at controlling symptoms.|$|E

5|$|Finn pursues Flame Princess (voiced by Jessica DiCicco), {{trying to}} explain to her that {{he does not want to}} hurt her. However, Flame Princess, {{confused}} by Finn's aversion to fire, assumes that he merely wants to taunt her. She ventures to the Goblin Kingdom, intent on <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> her new domain. Finn and Jake, meanwhile, return to the tree fort and, with the help of N.E.P.T.R. (voiced by Andy Milonakis), build flame-retardant battle robots.|$|E

50|$|Cutt Mill, sited on the River Stour to the {{northwest}} of the village, was burned down in 2003 by vandals.

5|$|Having seen Saigon {{slip from}} his hands on many {{occasions}} in the previous decade, Nguyễn Ánh was keen to strengthen his hold on the key southern city, <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> his capital, and the base for his preparations for his planned conquest of the Tây Sơn and Vietnam. His enemies had regularly raided the area and confiscated the rice harvest.|$|E
5|$|In the November/December 1982 {{issue of}} American Film, Chuck Ross {{claimed that he}} retyped the {{screenplay}} to Casablanca, changing the title back to Everybody Comes to Rick's {{and the name of}} the piano player to Dooley Wilson, and submitted it to 217 agencies. Eighty-five of them read it; of those, thirty-eight rejected it outright, thirty-three generally recognized it (but only eight specifically as Casablanca), three declared it commercially viable, and one suggested <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a novel.|$|E
5|$|Ne-Yo {{ventured out}} {{to open his}} own {{recording}} studio, called Carrington House, in Atlanta, Georgia. He also had started his own production company, Compound Entertainment, in 2007, and has hired several producers and songwriters in hopes of <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a full-fledged record label. It successfully became a label, and artists such as RaVaughn, Paula Campbell, Sixx John, Adrienne Bailon and Shanell are now associated with Compound.|$|E

5|$|Pumping protons {{out of the}} {{mitochondria}} {{creates a}} proton concentration difference across the membrane and generates an electrochemical gradient. This force drives protons back into the mitochondrion through the base of an enzyme called ATP synthase. The flow of protons makes the stalk subunit rotate, causing the active site of the synthase domain to change shape and phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate– <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> ATP.|$|E
5|$|By 1955, talks began about {{upgrading}} the highway. After a proposition to turn {{much of the}} route into a toll road failed, it was decided a four-lane freeway {{would be the best}} decision. However, opposition from residents in surrounding neighborhoods as well as a federal oil embargo only allowed widening of the approach between Fairgrounds Drive and I-80. In 1977, a levee broke and flooded a portion of the developed land, <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> protected wetlands that is home to endangered species. Because of its new status, environmental studies were needed in order to continue the project.|$|E
5|$|Gia Long's {{rule was}} {{noted for its}} Confucian orthodoxy. He overcame the Tây Sơn {{rebellion}} and reinstated the classical Confucian education and civil service system. He moved the capital from Hanoi south to Huế as the country's populace had also shifted south over the preceding centuries, and built up fortresses and a palace in his new capital. Using French expertise, he modernized Vietnam's defensive capabilities. In deference to the assistance of his French friends, he tolerated the activities of Roman Catholic missionaries, something that became increasingly restricted under his successors. Under his rule, Vietnam strengthened its military dominance in Indochina, expelling Siamese forces from Cambodia and <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a vassal state.|$|E

5|$|His {{governance}} greatly stabilized {{and helped}} develop the southern third of Vietnam, <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a wealthy and peaceful region. In addition, Duyệt opposed Emperor Minh Mạng's ascension and defended Christian missionaries and converts from the emperor's isolationist and Confucian policies. These attitudes brought Duyệt into conflict with Minh Mạng {{and led to the}} posthumous desecration of Duyệt's tomb, which provoked his adopted son Lê Văn Khôi to revolt against the court. Later, Emperor Thiệu Trị, the successor of Minh Mạng, rehabilitated Duyệt and restored his tomb.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, Gus Mears {{acquired}} the Stamford Bridge athletics stadium {{with the aim}} of <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a football ground. An offer to lease it to nearby Fulham was turned down, so Mears opted to found his own club to use the stadium. As there was already a team named Fulham in the borough, the name of the adjacent borough of Chelsea was chosen for the new club; names like Kensington FC, Stamford Bridge FC and London FC were also considered. Chelsea were founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher's Hook), opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on Fulham Road, and were elected to the Football League shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Madrid mailed {{her poem}} to six {{publishers}} in October 1999, notably Chronicle Books, before <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a local stage musical in August 2001. After seeing the trailer for Monsters, Inc., Madrid concluded that Chronicle Books had passed her work to Pixar {{and that the}} film was based on her work. In October 2001, she filed the suit against Chronicle Books, Pixar, and Disney in a federal court in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Her lawyer {{asked the court to}} issue a preliminary injunction, that would forbid Pixar and Disney from releasing the film while the suit was pending.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the more}} {{immediate}} ideas for redevelopment of the base was {{to turn it into}} a federal prison, something which had been done previously at the former Carswell AFB in Texas when the Federal Medical Center, Carswell was opened on its grounds. Many other former Air Force facilities have had prisons opened up on their grounds as well. From the outset, there was some reluctance in the town about <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> creating a prison culture in Limestone, but this was lessened once the government decided that it did not want to build a federal prison on the grounds of the former air base.|$|E
5|$|Parts of NY418 {{run through}} a {{proposed}} tourism district known as the First Wilderness Heritage Corridor. The corridor, conceived by Warren County, is intended to revitalize the Hudson River corridor by <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a tourist destination. Areas currently being studied for future development include the primarily residential and agricultural areas around Thurman Station, the privately owned train station along NY418 in this same area, and two vacant lots adjacent to the Hudson River on NY418. At some point in time, {{the entire length of}} NY418 was included as part of the Dude Ranch Trail, a New York State Scenic Byway that connects Lake George to the Hudson River.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{occupation}} in 1940 {{led to the}} closing of the church. During World War II, services were continued, but in the spring of 1944 hooligans broke into the church and destroyed the altar with the altarpiece, the organ, the chairs and the windows. In 1946, the congregation asked the Soviet government to list the Cathedral as a protected historical monument, but it failed to raise their interest. The church was empty for years; for some time it was used for storing grain, even plans for <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a swimming-pool were made.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} team {{hoped the}} new title {{would appeal to}} both newcomers and fans of the series, be accessible and introduce the franchise to a broader audience. They assumed most players would not have played the original Syndicate games. The team also considered {{that because of the}} change in audience tastes and the introduction of new video game platforms, altering the game's perspective to first-person was a correct decision. <b>Turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a first-person game was the first design choice made by the team, who hoped allowing players to view from the agent's perspective directly would make the game more immersive for players.|$|E
5|$|The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury {{says that}} the king also seized and {{depopulated}} many miles of land (36 parishes), <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the royal New Forest region to support his enthusiastic enjoyment of hunting. Modern historians {{have come to the}} conclusion that the New Forest depopulation was greatly exaggerated. Most of the lands of the New Forest are poor agricultural lands, and archaeological and geographic studies have shown that the New Forest was likely sparsely settled when it was turned into a royal forest. William was known for his love of hunting, and he introduced the forest law into areas of the country, regulating who could hunt and what could be hunted.|$|E
5|$|The {{permanent}} {{names of}} these moons were announced, together {{with that of}} 2003 EL61, by the International Astronomical Union on September 17, 2008: (136108) Haumea I Hiʻiaka and (136108) Haumea II Namaka. Each moon was named after a daughter of Haumea, the Hawaiian goddess of fertility and childbirth. Hiʻiaka is the goddess of dance and patroness of the Big Island of Hawaii, where the Mauna Kea Observatory is located. Nāmaka is the goddess of water and the sea; she cooled her sister Pele's lava as it flowed into the sea, <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> new land.|$|E
