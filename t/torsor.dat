2500|$|This intuition can be formalized {{by saying}} that any two finite totally ordered sets of the same {{cardinality}} have a natural isomorphism, the one that sends the least element {{of the first to}} the least element of the second, the least element of what remains in the first to the least element of what remains in the second, and so forth, but in general, pairs of sets of a given finite cardinality are not naturally isomorphic because {{there is more than one}} choice of map—except if the cardinality is 0 or 1, where there is a unique choice. different isomorphisms between two sets with three elements. This is equal to the number of automorphisms of a given three-element set (which in turn is equal to the order of the symmetric group on three letters), and more generally one has that the set of isomorphisms between two objects, denoted [...] is a <b>torsor</b> for the automorphism group of A, [...] and also a <b>torsor</b> for the automorphism group of B. In fact, automorphisms of an object are a key reason to be concerned with the distinction between isomorphism and equality, as demonstrated in the effect of change of basis on the identification of a vector space with its dual or with its double dual, as elaborated in the sequel. On this view and in this sense, these two sets are not equal because one cannot consider them identical: one can choose an isomorphism between them, but that is a weaker claim than identity—and valid only in the context of the chosen isomorphism.|$|E

2500|$|However, this {{approach}} {{does not explain}} the geometry behind affine connections nor how they acquired their name. The term really has its origins {{in the identification of}} tangent spaces in Euclidean space by translation: this property means that Euclidean -space is an affine space. (Alternatively, Euclidean space is a principal homogeneous space or <b>torsor</b> under the group of translations, which is a subgroup of the affine group.) As mentioned in the introduction, {{there are several ways to}} make this precise: one uses the fact that an affine connection defines a notion of parallel transport of vector fields along a curve. This also defines a parallel transport on the frame bundle. Infinitesimal parallel transport in the frame bundle yields another description of an affine connection, either as a Cartan connection for the affine group [...] or as a principal [...] connection on the frame bundle.|$|E

We use the language of infinity-topoi as the theoretical framework, since it has well-developed, extended notions of groups, actions, and <b>torsors,</b> which {{make it possible to}} regard the sheaf of K-theory spaces as a group object of such kind and to interpret a delooping theorem in K-theory as {{a classification}} theorem for <b>torsors</b> over it.

Then we describe extensions of Picard S- 2 -stacks in term of <b>torsors</b> under a Picard S- 2 -stack which are endowed with a group law on the fibers. As a consequence of such a description, we get an explicit right resolution of the 3 -category of extensions of Picard S- 2 -stacks in terms of 3 -categories of <b>torsors</b> under a Picard S- 2 -stack. Using the dictionary between the derived category of abelian sheaves on S and the category of Picard S- 2 -stacks, we rewrite this categorical right resolution in homological terms.
