5|$|Termites are {{relatively}} poor fliers and are readily blown downwind in wind speeds {{of less than}} 2km/h, shedding their wings soon after landing at an acceptable site, where they mate and attempt to form a nest in damp timber or earth. Wings of most termites have three heavy veins along the basal part of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the forewing and the crossveins near the wing tip are angled, making trapezoidal cells. Although subterranean termite wings have just two major veins along <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the forewing and the cross veins towards the wingtip are perpendicular to these veins, making square and rectangular cells.|$|E
5|$|A {{long line}} of subwoofers placed {{horizontally}} along <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the stage can be delayed such that the center subs fire several milliseconds prior to the ones flanking them, which fire several milliseconds prior to their neighbors, continuing in this fashion until the last subwoofers are reached at the outside ends of the subwoofer row (beamforming). This method helps to counteract the extreme narrowing of horizontal dispersion pattern seen with a horizontal subwoofer array. Such delay shading {{can be used to}} virtually reshape a loudspeaker array.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} lower molar, the labial and lingual conules of the anteroconid, the frontmost cusp, are {{separated}} by an anteromedian fossette. The second lower molar bears a crest, the anterolophid, before the two cusps, the protoconid and metaconid, that form <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the molar in some other oryzomyines. There is a distinct ridge (anterolabial cingulum) at the outer front (anterolabial) edge of the molar, before the protoconid. The third lower molar also bears an anterolophid and an anterolabial cingulum. The first lower molar has large roots at {{the front and back}} of the tooth and two smaller ones in between, at the labial and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have two large roots, one at the front and one at the back.|$|E
50|$|The gown of the pro-chancellor is {{dark blue}} {{with a gold}} and white trim on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gown.

5|$|The first lower molar is rounded at {{the front}} end and the labial and lingual conules of the anteroconid, the frontmost cusp, are barely distinct. The second lower molar is {{elongated}} and has a crest, the anterolophid, before the two cusps that form <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the molar in some other oryzomyines, the protoconid and metaconid. A distinct ridge (anterolabial cingulum) is at the outer front (anterolabial) edge of the molar, before the protoconid. The lower third molar is {{about as long as}} the second and also has an anterolophid, albeit a less well-defined one. The first lower molar has large roots {{at the front}} and back of the tooth and usually one or two smaller ones in between, at the labial and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have either two roots, one labial and one lingual, or only one at the front, and another large root at the back.|$|E
5|$|Various {{distinguishing}} {{traits of}} the lower jaw have been established. The longitudinal groove on the outer surface of the dentary is wide. The third tooth socket of the dentary is not enlarged. Seen from above, the dentary is straight without an expanded jaw tip. The interdental plates, reinforcing the teeth from behind, {{of the lower}} jaw are tall. Benson also concluded it would be most parsimonious {{to assume that the}} Stonesfield Slate material represents a single species. If so, several additional distinctive traits can be observed {{in other parts of the}} skeleton. The low vertical ridge on the outer side of the ilium, above the hip joint, shows parallel vertical grooves. The bony skirts between the shafts of the ischia are thick and touch each other forming an almost flat surface. There is a boss present on the lower outer side of the ischium shaft with a rough surface. The underside of the second sacral vertebra has an angular longitudinal keel. A ridge on the upper side of the third metatarsal connected to a groove in the side of the second metatarsal. The middle of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the scapula forms a thin crest.|$|E
25|$|In {{the pelvis}} {{there was a}} little notch in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the ilium. The {{relatively}} long shaft of the ischium curved downwards. The hindlimb was elongated, largely because of a long lower leg, having 90% of the length of the thighbone. The foot was also long, especially in the metatarsus.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dorsal fins and the {{pectoral}} fins are hardened into stiff spines. These spines can {{be raised}} into position {{at right angles to}} the body and locked into position for defensive purposes. [...] The ability to lock the spines into place comes from several small bones attached to the spine, and once raised, the spines cannot be folded down by exerting pressure on the tip.|$|R
25|$|The 2011 study {{established}} eight unique derived traits or autapomorphies {{in which}} Scipionyx differed from its closest relatives. The praemaxilla has five teeth. Where the parietal and the frontal bone make contact, the depression {{in which the}} supratemporal fenestra, a skull roof opening, was present, shows a sinuous ridge on the postorbital. The lower branch of the squamosal has a rectangular end. The wrist consists of just two, superimposed, bones: a radial and a lower element formed by a fusion {{of the first and}} second carpal. This last element has the shape of a lens, not a crescent; is flattened; and is fused seamlessly. The first finger is conspicuously elongated, 23% longer than the third finger. The notch in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the ilium is directed to the front and only weakly developed. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the ischium shaft has a long obturator process with a rectangular end.|$|E
25|$|Between <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the pubic shafts and {{the back}} of the {{intestines}} a large empty space is present. Also, the rectum seems to run in a very high position as if it were forced upwards by something. According to Dal Sasso & Maganuco, in life this space would have been filled by the yolk sac of the hatchling; on hatching the juveniles of reptiles typically have not absorbed all the yolk and use the residual nutrients to supplement the food intake during their first weeks.|$|E
25|$|Marimba bars {{produce their}} fullest sound when struck just off center, while {{striking}} {{the bar in}} the center produces a more articulate tone. On chromatic marimbas, the accidentals (black keys) can also be played on the space between <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the bar and its node (the place where the string goes through the bar) if necessary. Playing on the node produces a sonically weak tone, and the technique is only used when the player or composer {{is looking for a}} muted sound from the instrument.|$|E
25|$|The speaker {{mounting}} scheme (including cabinets) {{can also}} cause diffraction, resulting in peaks and dips in the frequency response. The problem is usually greatest at higher frequencies, where wavelengths are similar to, or smaller than, cabinet dimensions. The effect can be minimized by rounding <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cabinet, curving the cabinet itself, using a smaller or narrower enclosure, choosing a strategic driver arrangement, using absorptive material around a driver, {{or some combination of}} these and other schemes.|$|R
2500|$|The {{general layout}} of the mosque {{consists}} of a large open courtyard (sahn) enclosed by four arcades (riwaqs.)

The latter consists of a large pointed arch with corbels on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> its roof. Facing the courtyard is the dikka ("tribune") from which the Qur'an is recited. The structure uses Western European-style capitals that Islamic architecture expert Doris Behrens-Abouseif believes were taken from Crusader-era structures in the Levant.|$|R
50|$|Smooth flower coral {{is found}} in the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, the Bahamas and {{southern}} Florida, at depths down to about 60 m though it is commonest between 5 and 30 m. It is found on both the back and <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> reefs and is sometimes overhung by larger corals. It is listed as being of least concern by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as it is common throughout its range and locally abundant in the south Caribbean.|$|R
25|$|The fangs, {{which are}} {{enlarged}} and hollow, {{are the first}} two teeth on each maxillary bone. Usually only one fang is in place on each side at any time. The maxilla is intermediate in both length and mobility between typical colubrids (long, less mobile) and viperids (very short, highly mobile). When the mouth is closed, the fangs fit into grooved slots in the buccal floor and usually below <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the eye and are angled backwards; some elapids (Acanthophis, taipan, mamba, and king cobra) have long fangs on quite mobile maxillae and can make fast strikes.|$|E
25|$|At the Divine Liturgy, {{during the}} Liturgy of Preparation, when the Aër {{is to be}} placed over the Gifts (the Bread and Wine for the Eucharist), it is first wrapped around the censer and then laid over the Chalice and Diskos, so that <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the Aër just touches {{the surface of the}} table. When not {{covering}} the Gifts, the Aër is folded (usually folded 3 x 3, so that when it is laid out flat the creases will form a cross). The Aër normally has a cross embroidered in its exact center, so that when it is folded the cross is visible.|$|E
25|$|Just {{before the}} {{chanting}} of the Symbol of the Faith (Nicene Creed), the Priest will kiss the Diskos and Chalice (by kissing the Aër {{in the place}} where it touches each vessel) and <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the Holy Table. During the Creed, the priest will hold the Aër above the Gifts and waive it slowly, indicating the activity of the Holy Spirit. When a bishop is serving the Liturgy, the concelebrating priests will hold the Aër during the Creed as the bishop kneels (or bows his head) underneath it. After the Creed, the Aër is folded and placed on the Holy Table. In some practices, the priest will turn and bless the people with the Aër during the Sursum corda.|$|E

25|$|These {{buildings}} were semi-circular and possessed certain inherent architectural structures, with minor differences {{depending on the}} region {{in which they were}} constructed. The scaenae frons was a high back wall of the stage floor, supported by columns. The proscaenium was a wall that supported <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the stage with ornately decorated niches off to the sides. The Hellenistic influence is seen through the use of the proscaenium. The Roman theatre also had a podium, which sometimes supported the columns of the scaenae frons. The scaenae was originally not part of the building itself, constructed only to provide sufficient background for the actors. Eventually, it became a part of the edifice itself, made out of concrete. The theatre itself was divided into the stage (orchestra) and the seating section (auditorium). Vomitoria or entrances and exits were made available to the audience.|$|E
25|$|Benchtop {{table saws}} {{are the least}} {{expensive}} and least capable {{of the three major}} types; however, they can offer adequate capacity and precision for many tasks. The universal motor is not as durable or as quiet as an induction motor, but it offers more power relative to its size and weight. The top of a benchtop table saw is narrower than those of the contractors and cabinet saws, so the width of stock that can be ripped is reduced. Another restriction results from the top being smaller {{from the front of the}} tabletop to the rear. This results in a shorter rip fence, which makes it harder to make a clean, straight cut when ripping. Also, there is less distance from <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the tabletop to the blade, which makes cross cutting stock using a mitre more difficult (the mitre and/or stock may not be fully supported by the table in front of the blade). Benchtop saws are the smallest type of table saw and have the least mass, potentially resulting in increased vibration during a cut.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{tracking}} {{of the blade}} is crucial to accurate cutting and considerably reduces blade breakage. The first step to ensuring good tracking is to check that the two bandwheels or flywheels are co-planar. This {{can be done by}} placing a straightedge across the front of the wheels and adjusting until each wheel touches. Rotate the wheels with the blade in position and properly tensioned and check that the tracking is correct. Now install the blade guide rollers and leave a gap of about 1 mm between the back of the blade and the guide flange. The teeth of blades that have become narrow through repeated sharpening will foul <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the guide rollers due to their kerf set and force the blade out of alignment. This can be remedied by cutting of a small step on the rollers' front edges to accommodate the protruding teeth. Ideally the rollers should be crowned, (see belt_and_pulley_systems) a configuration that assists in the proper {{tracking of}} bands and belts, at the same time allowing clearance for the set of the teeth.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, Allain {{established}} some distinctive traits. Dubreuillosaurus has {{an unusually}} low and long skull, with a length {{three times the}} height. In the upper corner of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the nasal branch of the maxilla, a kink is present, separating a convex curvature below from a concave curvature above. The descending branch of the postorbital has a U-shaped cross-section. The parietal bones are not visible in side view. The supratemporal fenestra has a straight inner edge. A paraquadratic fenestra is lacking. A well-developed process is present {{on the underside of}} the jugal branch of the ectopterygoid. The rear edge of the jugal branch of the ectopterygoid, in front of the infratemporal fenestra, is deeply grooved. The lower jaw has a large external mandibular fenestra. The foramen mylohyoideum is largely oriented to the front and below. The head of the thighbone is directed to the inside and below. The front underside of the thighbone has a concave surface. In 2012 Matthew Carrano added one autapomorphy: on the rear of the braincase there is a notch between the basioccipital and the bone surface formed by the exoccipitals and the opisthotic.|$|E
25|$|Like other maniraptorans, Anchiornis had a propatagium, a flap of skin {{connecting}} the wrist {{to the shoulder}} and rounding out <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the wing. In Anchiornis, {{this part of the}} wing was covered in covert feathers which smoothed the wing and covered the gaps between the larger primary and secondary feathers. However, unlike modern birds, the covert feathers of Anchiornis were not arranged in tracts or rows. The arrangement of the covert feathers was also more primitive in Anchiornis than in birds and more advanced paravians. In modern birds, the coverts usually cover only the upper portion of the wing, with most of the wing surface made up of uncovered flight feathers. In some Anchiornis fossils, on the other hand, several layers of covert feathers seem to extend down to cover most of the wing's surface, so that the wing is essentially made of multiple layers of feathers, rather than a layer of broad feathers with only their bases hidden by layers of coverts. This multi-layered wing arrangement might have helped strengthen the wing, considering that the primary and secondary feathers themselves were narrow and weak.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 Carpenter {{provided}} a diagnosis. Due to his conclusion that Hesperosaurus were rather basal, in it many comparisons {{were made with}} the basalmost known stegosaurian Huayangosaurus, that lost their relevance once {{it became clear that}} the phylogenetic position was in fact quite derived. In 2008 Maidment indicated three autapomorphies: the possession of eleven back vertebrae; the fourth sacral not being fused to the sacrum; back plates that are longer (from front to rear) than tall. Maidment also provided some traits in which Hesperosaurus was more basal than Stegosaurus armatus. In the atlas, even in adult specimens the neural arches are not fused to the intercentrum. The postzygapophyses, the rear joint processes, of the rear neck vertebrae do not prominently protrude upwards. In the back vertebrae, the neural arches, above the level of the neural canal, are not especially lengthened to above. At the hip region ossified tendons are present. The ribs are expanded at their lower ends. The neural spines of the tail vertebrae are not bifurcated. The lower end of the pubic bone is expanded (spoon-shaped in side view). To Carpenter this differential diagnosis was problematic because he considered Stegosaurus armatus, the type species of Stegosaurus, a nomen dubium and rejected Maidment's lumping of all North-American Stegosaurus material into a single species, the great variability of which making it difficult to establish any differences with Hesperosaurus. He considered Stegosaurus stenops, the name historically given to several well-preserved specimens, a separate species and {{provided a}} new differential diagnosis of Hesperosaurus compared to S. stenops. The antorbital fenestra is large instead of very small. The maxilla is short and deep, half as tall as long, instead of having a height a third of the length. The basisphenoid of the lower braincase is short instead of long. Thirteen neck vertebrae are present instead of ten. Thirteen dorsal (back) vertebrae are present instead of seventeen. The middle dorsals have a basal form in possessing a low neural arch rather than a high one. The cervical ribs have expanded lower ends. In the front tail vertebrae, the tops of the neural spines are rounded instead of bifurcated. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the shoulderblade is indented instead of running parallel to the rear edge. The front blade of the ilium diverges strongly sideways instead of weakly. The rear blade of the ilium has a knob-shaped expansion at the rear end. The front end of the prepubic process has an upward expansion. The plates of the hip and tail base are oval and low instead of high and triangular.|$|E
