30|$|Genomic DNA {{was used}} to {{generate}} short-insert (500  bp) paired-end sequencing libraries according to the Illumina standard protocol. Genomic DNA from each species was sequenced using a HiSeq™ 2000 analyzer (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA) at Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI, Shenzhen, China).The raw reads (20, 777, 674 and 20, 787, 108  bp for P. chekiangensis and P. bournei) were generated with 125  bp length and assembled into whole chloroplast genomes in a multi-step approach employing a modified pipeline that involved {{a combination of both}} reference guided and de novo assembly approaches. First, paired-end sequence reads were trimmed to remove low-quality bases (Q < 20, 0.01 probability error) and adapter sequences using CLC-quality <b>trim</b> <b>tool</b> (quality_trim software included in CLC ASSEMBLY CELL package, [URL] before undertaking sequence assembly. Second, the contigs were assembled using CLC de novo assembler with the following optimized parameters: bubble size of 98, minimum contig length of 200, mismatch cost of two, deletion and insertion costs of three, length fraction of 0.9, and similarity fraction of 0.8. Third, all the contigs were aligned to the reference chloroplast genome of Machilus yunnanensis (NC 028073) using BLAST ([URL] and aligned contigs (≥ 90 % similarity and query coverage) were ordered according to the reference chloroplast genome. Then, contigs were aligned with the reference genome to construct the draft chloroplast genome of each species in Geneious 9.0. 5 software ([URL] Finally, clean reads were re-mapped to the draft cp genomes of two Phoebe species, and the mapping ratio were 3.41 % for P. chekiangensis and 2.15 % for P. bournei, and average coverage depth were 578.2 and 367.1 for P. chekiangensis and P. bournei, respectively. Using the Dual Organellar Genome Annotator (DOGMA) program (Wyman et al. 2004), the two Phoebe chloroplast genomes were annotated. Protein-coding genes were identified by using the plastid/bacterial genetic code. Intron/exon boundaries were further determined using MAFFT v 7 with those of the M. yunnanensis chloroplast genomes as a reference (Katoh and Standley 2013). Using the program tRNAscan-SEwith default settings (Schattner et al. 2005), tRNA boundaries were verified. The circular chloroplast genome maps of the Phoebe were drawn using the Organellar Genome DRAW (OGDRAW) software, with subsequent manual editing (Lohse et al. 2007).|$|E

40|$|AbstractContaminant {{oligonucleotide}} sequences such as primers and adapters {{can occur}} in both ends of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) reads. AlienTrimmer was developed in order to detect and remove such contaminants. Based on the decomposition of specified alien nucleotide sequences into k-mers, AlienTrimmer is able to determine whether such alien k-mers are occurring in one or in both read ends by using a simple polynomial algorithm. Therefore, AlienTrimmer can process typical HTS single- or paired-end files with millions of reads in several minutes with very low computer resources. Based on the analysis of both simulated and real-case Illumina®, 454 ™ and Ion Torrent™ read data, we show that AlienTrimmer performs with excellent accuracy and speed in comparison with other <b>trimming</b> <b>tools.</b> The program is freely available at ftp://ftp. pasteur. fr/pub/gensoft/projects/AlienTrimmer/...|$|R

50|$|An {{integral}} part of the thermoforming process is the tooling which is specific to each part that is to be produced. Thin-gauge thermoforming as described above is almost always performed on in-line machines and typically requires molds, plug assists, pressure boxes and all mounting plates as well as the <b>trim</b> <b>tooling</b> and stacker parts that pertain to the job. Thick or heavy-gauge thermoforming also requires tooling specific to each part, but because the part size can be very large, the molds can be cast aluminum or some other composite material as well as machined aluminum as in thin gauge. Typically thick-gauge parts must be trimmed on CNC routers or hand trimmed using saws or hand routers. Even the most sophisticated thermoforming machine is limited {{to the quality of the}} tooling. Some large thermoforming manufacturers choose to have design and tool making facilities in house while others will rely on outside tool-making shops to build the tooling.|$|R

50|$|Thermoforming {{has benefited}} from {{applications}} of engineering technology3, although the basic forming process {{is very similar to}} what was invented many years ago. Microprocessor and computer controls on more modern machinery allow for greatly increased process control and repeatability of same-job setups from one production run with the ability to save oven heater and process timing settings between jobs. The ability to place formed sheet into an inline trim station for more precise trim registration has been hugely improved due to the common use of electric servo motors for chain indexing versus air cylinders, gear racks, and clutches on older machines. Electric servo motors are also used on some modern and more sophisticated forming machines for actuation of the machine platens where form and <b>trim</b> <b>tooling</b> are mounted, rather than air cylinders which have traditionally been the industry standard, giving more precise control over closing and opening speeds and timing of the tooling. Quartz and radiant-panel oven heaters generally provide more precise and thorough sheet heating over older cal-rod type heaters, and better allow for zoning of ovens into areas of adjustable heat..|$|R

40|$|The rapid {{evolution}} of micorelectronics is placing greater {{demands on the}} packaging technology of integrated circuits (IC), the trend being towards higher lead counts, smaller lead width, finer lead pitch and thinner leadframes. These demands impose stringent requirements {{on the quality of}} dam-bar cutting, the latter being a mechanical trimming process in which the dam bar btween the leads of an IC package after post-molding process is pierced out. The leadframe thickness and the area of cutting are in the order of one tenth of a millimeter and cutting is performed at a much higher speed than that found in conventional blanking and piercing processes. In this work, a purposely built single-punch dam-bar cutting press was constructed. The effects of percentage punch-die clearance, punch shear and the plastic anisotropy of the leadframe materials on the cutting force and energy, {{and the quality of the}} sheared edge of the dam-bar, were studied.

40|$|In recent years, {{the life}} cycle of car models has {{decreased}} from 7 to 5 years and the volume sizes are becoming shorter in the automotive industry. The increasing number of car models introduced to the market means that a fewer number of parts must pay the costs for the tool/die design and manufacturing. In consequence, {{there is a need for}} reducing the manufacturing cost and lead time for the tool and die manufacturing. The higher product requirements (reduced weight, increased safety and lower emissions) have meant that a larger number of car body parts must be made in AHSS (Advanced High Strength Steels). This has led to a significantly larger abrasive and fatigue tool wear. The tool wear is therefore expected to increase even more in the future, if the issue is not addressed properly. Today the total maintenance cost of the <b>trimming</b> <b>tools</b> are approximately 70 % of the total die maintenance cost in a press shop. The purpose of this thesis is to increase the knowledge of how surface topography and geometry on <b>trimming</b> dies influences <b>tool</b> wear, tool life and part quality. Methods to analyze wear, measure cutting edge radius on production dies and methods to analyze surface topography have been established. The cutting edge geometry has been evaluated with respect to the cutting edge radius and the angle of the upper tool. Experimental testing together with FE simulation has been used. Results show that by using a cutting edge radius of 80 µm, rather than 20 µm, the tool “wear in phase” can be more controlled. Sheet metal trimming when cutting at high angles (25 ° - 60 °) has been evaluated. Two versions of the geometry on the lower cutting edge was tested, a traditional geometry and a 1. 5 mm shelf geometry. Results show that the shelf geometry reduces side force, especially for the higher angles. The shelf geometry also reduces the sharpness off the cut edge profile, thus increasing part quality, compared to the traditional geometry. Surfaces on both semi-industrial test dies and dies used in production were analyzed with different surface topography analysis methods. The result shows that the wear process is different on the different sides of the trimming edge. The texture direction of the surface is changed due to wear, with the strongest change on the clearance side of the edge. The roughness on sheet side of the edge is reduced due to a hammering effect from the sheet material. The result on the semiindustrial test dies and the production dies correlates well. Future research will be continued on surface topography and trimming edge geometry and its relationship to used manufacturing methods and tool wear...|$|R
40|$|Wu, Cathy H. High-throughput Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) {{technologies}} have revolutionized and accelerated genomic analyses. However, their shorter read length and higher error rates {{in comparison to}} classical Sanger sequencing have hindered downstream analyses such as de novo genome assembly. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop tools for quality control and pre-processing of NGS short-read data and perform systematical assessments of their impact on downstream analyses Many de novo assembly projects that use NGS include a pre-processing step where low quality reads and sequence artifacts are cleaned from NGS reads using unpublished in-house scripts. Although some open-source and commercial trimming scripts or pre-processing tools are available, a simple and comprehensive open-source toolkit with major trimming algorithms is currently lacking. Furthermore, most of the aforementioned assembly projects assess assembly by contiguity alone without evaluating the correctness of the assembled contigs. The problem of misassembly is complicated further in metagenomic assemblies by contig chimerism, which {{is caused by the}} co-assembly of reads from two or more genomes at regions of sequence similarity. Recently developed metagenomic assemblers attempts to solve this problem during assembly, but they are trained on short, high-coverage Illumina reads and not the long, low-coverage reads of 454, the preferred platform for metagenome sequencing. Contig chimerism affects downstream metagenome analyses, such as binning and gene prediction. Presented are methods and tools for pre- and post-assembly processing of NGS data. ngsShoRT (next-generation-sequencing Short Reads <b>Trimmer),</b> a <b>tool</b> written in Perl to implement many of the commonly used algorithms in trimming literature as well as methods developed by our group, was developed for pre-processing of NGS reads. ngsShORT was tested on Illumina paired-end (PE) reads of the Caenorhabditis elegans genome, and its trimming methods were compared by the improvement in assembly contiguity as well as accuracy with BLAST. A particular problem in trimming NGS reads is the identification of adaptor sequences in NGS reads that may not be detected by regular text-search algorithms. This problem can be managed by the identification and removal ofhigh frequency K-mers in reads using kmerFreq, our adaptor sequence detection and <b>trimming</b> <b>tool.</b> kmerFreq was tested on 454 reads of a viral metagenome specimen and the resulting improvement in assembly contiguity and assembler performance was evaluated. Finally, an analysis pipeline forc ontig chimerism in metagenomic assemblies of simulated 454 reads is presented and tested on a simulated bacterial metagenome. Our hypothesis is that chimeric contigs can be identified in a metagenomic assembly by the presence of unique coverage and polymorphism attributes that distinguish them from non-chimeric contigs. To train this post-assembly approach, a chimeric contig simulation and analysis pipeline was developed to study contig chimerism in assemblies of simulated metagenomes. The pipeline was used to simulate a bacterial metagenome and analyze and compare chimeric and non-chimeric contigs in its assembly. The results of this analysis may provide insight into coverage and polymorphism patterns in chimeric contigs, and may be useful for the detection of chimeric contigs in a real metagenome assembly.

40|$|SummaryAlthough tool use {{is known}} to occur in species ranging from naked mole rats [1] to owls [2], {{chimpanzees}} are the most accomplished tool users [3 – 5]. The modification and use of tools during hunting, however, is still {{considered to be a}} uniquely human trait among primates.

Existing methods give the ability to quickly create a substantial strong part, specifically from three dimensional Computer Aided Design (CAD) information, from a scope of materials, for example, photo curable resin, powders and paper. Much of the time, the final result of a formative cycle is a metallic object with dimensionally steady and of high precision, whether it is a part or a device. Part testimony introduction is vital variable of layered assembling as it impacts fabricate time, bolster structure, dimensional exactness, surface complete and expense of the model. Various layered assembling procedure particular parameters and imperatives must be considered while choosing the part statement introduction. Determination of an ideal part affidavit introduction is a troublesome and prolonged errand as one needs to exchange off among different negating destinations like part surface complete and construct time. It is referred to those process parameters, for example, the air gap between adjoining tracks, raster point, thickness, width of kept layers impact the execution of parts created on a FDM machine. From the outcomes, it is discovered that FDM parameters, i. e. layer thickness, raster edge and air gap altogether influence the versatile execution of the compliant ABS model.
