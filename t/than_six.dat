25|$|This {{classification}} is now discouraged, {{because the}} ascribed associations (in terms of organism and prognosis) were {{not strong enough}} to be relied upon clinically. The terms short incubation (meaning less <b>than</b> about <b>six</b> weeks), and long incubation (greater <b>than</b> about <b>six</b> weeks) are preferred.|$|R

5|$|In children, {{particularly}} those younger <b>than</b> <b>six</b> years old, the diagnosis {{can be difficult}} and the condition is often initially mistaken (sometimes {{for up to two}} weeks) for other causes of pains and difficulty walking, such as viral infections, or bone and joint problems.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} qualify for hospice care, a patient must have {{certification}} from two physicians {{that he or she}} has less <b>than</b> <b>six</b> months to live if his or her disease runs its natural course; usually the patient's primary physician and the Hospice Medical Director will provide this certification. Patients can and do stay on hospice longer <b>than</b> <b>six</b> months, {{and as long as the}} hospice team continues to certify with supporting evidence that the patient is terminal, insurance companies will usually continue to pay for hospice care.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} qualify for hospice, a patient has to be {{certified}} as having a prognosis of less <b>than</b> <b>six</b> months to live. Sometimes patients live longer. Medicare patients who receive the hospice benefit must waive other Medicare benefits that could prolong life. Under the Medicare provisions, the hospice benefit through {{the first six months}} is broken up into two 90-day benefit periods. At the end of these two benefit periods, the hospice team will evaluate whether or not the patient continues to have a prognosis of less <b>than</b> <b>six</b> months to live. Following these two 90-day benefit periods, the hospice is required to evaluate more closely and review the case every 60 days. Commercial insurers, managed care program providers, and Medicaid often have their own regulations regarding re-certification. When the hospice re-certifies a six-month or less prognosis, this is based on the patient's current condition.|$|E

5|$|The brigade {{provided}} all non-divisional engineer {{support in}} Military Regions III and IV during eleven campaigns. Units cleared {{more than one-half}} million acres (2,000km²) of jungle, paved 500 kilometers of highway, and constructed bridges totaling more <b>than</b> <b>six</b> miles (10km) in length. As American forces were withdrawing from Vietnam, the brigade was inactivated 20 September 1971.|$|E
5|$|Attention deficit {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) is a mental disorder of the neurodevelopmental type. It is characterized by problems paying attention, excessive activity, or difficulty controlling behavior which is not appropriate for a person's age. The symptoms appear before a person is twelve years old, are present for more <b>than</b> <b>six</b> months, and cause problems {{in at least two}} settings (such as school, home, or recreational activities). In children, problems paying attention may result in poor school performance. Although it causes impairment, particularly in modern society, many children with ADHD have a good attention span for tasks they find interesting.|$|E

2500|$|The {{oxidation}} {{potential is}} important because it is one indicator of how tightly bound to the ore the metal is likely to be. [...] As can be seen, iron is significantly higher <b>than</b> the other <b>six</b> metals while gold is dramatically lower <b>than</b> the <b>six</b> above it. Gold's low oxidation {{is one of the main}} reasons that gold is found in nuggets. These nuggets are relatively pure gold and are workable as they are found.|$|R

5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} after the Test series came against the Leveson Gower's XI. During the last Australian tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England eleven; for this tour, Bradman insisted {{that no more}} <b>than</b> <b>six</b> current Test players be allowed to represent for the hosts. The Australian skipper then fielded a full-strength team. Miller returned for this match, held at Scarborough, but did little, scoring one in his only innings and bowling eight overs without success in a match that ended in a rain-affected draw.|$|E
5|$|Before 1937–38 he {{had scored}} 43 goals in four seasons, and full-backs began to mark him more tightly; {{because of this}} he decided to drop deeper to collect the ball and aim to play {{pinpoint}} crosses as opposed to going for glory himself. Though he would never again score more <b>than</b> <b>six</b> goals in a season, this made him more an effective team player and a greater threat to the opposition.|$|E
5|$|Brechin and Queen of the South {{were both}} aiming {{to win their}} second trophy in less <b>than</b> <b>six</b> months, having been crowned champions of the Third and Second Divisions {{respectively}} the previous season. Despite recent league success, Brechin had never reached the final of a national cup competition in its 96-year history whilst Queen of the South were making only their second appearance in a cup final since losing the 1997 final to Falkirk in the same competition.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{measures}} {{taken by the}} club to minimise recurrences, including the erection of a [...] high fence in March 1975 {{on top of a}} [...] boundary wall and asking batsmen to try to hit fours rather <b>than</b> <b>sixes,</b> a few balls continued to be hit out of the ground each season. [...] For example, in 1975, 36 matches were played over 20 weeks in the summer, with 2,221 six-ball overs being bowled. [...] Out of the 13,326 legitimate deliveries (ignoring no-balls and wides) there were 120 sixes, of which six crossed the fence and fell into the housing estate.|$|R

5|$|By 1918, the US Department of Treasury {{called for}} all {{drinking}} water to be disinfected with chlorine. Chlorine is presently an important chemical for water purification (such as in water treatment plants), in disinfectants, and in bleach. As a disinfectant in water, chlorine {{is more than}} three times as effective against Escherichia coli as bromine, and more <b>than</b> <b>six</b> times as effective as iodine.|$|E
5|$|By July 1940 the {{situation}} had improved somewhat with uniforms, a modicum of training {{and the arrival of}} hundreds of thousands of rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition from the USA. New weapons were developed that could be produced cheaply without consuming materials that were needed to produce armaments for the regular units. An early example was the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade (a glass bottle filled with highly flammable material of which more <b>than</b> <b>six</b> million were made), and the No. 73 Grenade (an anti-tank grenade resembling a Thermos flask).|$|E
5|$|Criminal {{cases with}} an assumed {{perpetrator}} {{are sent to}} the public prosecutor, who will consider issuing an indictment. If positive, the trial {{will take place at}} a district court, with a police prosecutor presiding over the case. Cases with more <b>than</b> <b>six</b> years maximum penalty will normally be carried out with public prosecutors prosecuting. Either party can, on specified terms, appeal the outcome of the case to the court of appeal and ultimately the Supreme Court of Norway.|$|E

5|$|Early in 1958, Kelly {{recorded}} his second album as leader, the quartet Piano, more <b>than</b> <b>six</b> {{years after his}} first. In the same year, he played for recordings led by, among others, vocalist Betty Carter, and made {{the first of several}} appearances on albums led by Cannonball Adderley, Blue Mitchell, and Hank Mobley. Kelly also played organ on one track of Pepper Adams and Jimmy Knepper's The Pepper-Knepper Quintet, an unusual departure from his usual instrument.|$|E
5|$|Exercise {{appears to}} be useful for {{preventing}} low back pain. Exercise is also probably effective in preventing recurrences in those with pain that has lasted more <b>than</b> <b>six</b> weeks. Medium-firm mattresses are more beneficial for chronic pain than firm mattresses. There is little to no evidence that back belts are any more helpful in preventing low back pain than education about proper lifting techniques. Shoe insoles do not help prevent low back pain.|$|E
