5|$|Accompanied {{in theaters}} by the Mickey Mouse {{featurette}} The Prince and the Pauper, The Rescuers Down Under (1990) was Disney's first animated feature sequel and the studio's first film {{to be fully}} colored and composited via computer using the CAPS system. However, the film did not duplicate the success of The Little Mermaid. The next Disney animated feature, Beauty and the Beast, had begun production in London but was moved back to Burbank after Disney decided to shutter the London satellite office and retool the film into a musical-comedy format similar <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Little</b> Mermaid. Alan Menken and Howard Ashman were retained to write the song score, though Ashman died before production was completed.|$|E

5|$|The Theatre Royal reopened on 24 September 1733 with a {{new company}} of actors, though they were less {{experienced}} and talented than the old crew. The majority of old actors moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Theatre, Haymarket, though a few remained loyal. Henry Fielding sided with the managers and produced several plays to aid the Theatre Royal, though this caused a backlash when the rebelling actors finally won the dispute. By the end of 1733, the rebellious actors managed to seize legal control of the theatre's property and Highmore, the sole manager of the Theatre Royal at the time, lost all legal abilities to stop them. By February 1734, he sold his shares to Charles Fleetwood who then made {{an agreement with the}} actors that secured their return.|$|E

5|$|The {{first years}} of the 14th century were marked by famines, {{culminating}} in the Great Famine of 1315–17. The causes of the Great Famine included the slow transition from the Medieval Warm Period <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Ice Age, which left the population vulnerable when bad weather caused crop failures. The years 1313–14 and 1317–21 were excessively rainy throughout Europe, resulting in widespread crop failures. The climate change—which resulted in a declining average annual temperature for Europe during the 14th century—was accompanied by an economic downturn.|$|E
5|$|This large kiwi {{is one of}} five {{species of}} kiwis {{residing}} in New Zealand. The other four are the tokoeka (Apteryx australis), Okarito brown kiwi (Apteryx rowi), little spotted kiwi (Apteryx owenii), and North Island brown kiwi (Apteryx mantelli). Great spotted kiwis are related most closely <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> spotted kiwi. The kiwi genus, Apteryx, is endemic to New Zealand, 44% of the bird species native to New Zealand are endemic. Kiwis are placed in the ratite family, which also includes the emu, ostrich, rhea, and cassowary. All ratites are flightless. Kiwi are closely related to the extinct moa bird that once inhabited New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|Walt Disney first {{attempted}} {{unsuccessfully to}} adapt Beauty and the Beast into an animated film during the 1930s and 1950s. Following {{the success of}} The Little Mermaid (1989), Walt Disney Pictures decided to adapt the fairy tale, which Richard Purdum originally conceived as a non-musical. Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg eventually dismissed Purdum's idea and ordered that the film be a musical similar <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Little</b> Mermaid instead. The film was directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, with a screenplay by Linda Woolverton story first credited to Roger Allers. Lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken wrote the film's songs. Ashman, who additionally served as the film's executive producer, died of AIDS-related complications eight months before the film's release, and the film is thus dedicated to his memory.|$|E
5|$|As Barry {{approached}} the Florida Panhandle, voluntary evacuations {{took place in}} eight counties. Shelters opened in six counties, though most were placed on standby. In parts of Franklin County, mandatory evacuations were ordered, and in Okaloosa County, tolls on the Mid-Bay Bridge were suspended. Forty C-130 cargo aircraft and about 300 personnel from Hurlburt Field were moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Rock Air Force Base in Arkansas to flee the storm's projected path. In Tallahassee, county officials filled sandbags in areas vulnerable to flooding. At Grand Isle State Park, park rangers moved picnic tables out of tidal range and closed the camping grounds {{for a period of}} time. Additionally, the storm forced NASA to delay a shuttle launch in southern Florida. Elsewhere, thousands of personnel were evacuated from several offshore oil platforms. The city of New Orleans closed 60 of its 72 floodgates to avoid possible flooding. Throughout southeastern Louisiana, including New Orleans, roughly 500Red Cross volunteers and staff members were on standby.
