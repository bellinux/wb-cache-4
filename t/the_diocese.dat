5|$|There are 42 The Church of England dioceses, each {{being an}} {{administrative}} territorial unit {{governed by a}} bishop. These cover England, the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands and {{a small part of}} Wales. <b>The</b> <b>Diocese</b> in Europe is also a part of the Church of England, and covers the whole of continental Europe, Morocco and the post-Soviet states. The structure of dioceses within the Church of England was initially inherited from the Catholic Church as part of the Protestant Reformation. During the Reformation a number of new dioceses were founded, but no more were then created until the middle of the 19th century, when dioceses were founded mainly in response to the growing population, especially in the northern industrial cities. The most recent diocese to be established was <b>the</b> <b>Diocese</b> of Leeds, which came into being on 20 April 2014. Prior to that, no new dioceses had been founded since 1927. Leeds was created by combining three previous dioceses: <b>the</b> <b>Diocese</b> of Bradford, <b>the</b> <b>Diocese</b> of Ripon and Leeds, and <b>the</b> <b>Diocese</b> of Wakefield.|$|E
5|$|Also {{contained}} in Hemming's {{work is a}} description of the lawsuit between <b>the</b> <b>diocese</b> of Worcester and Evesham Abbey, which took place between 1078 and 1085. Although only Hemming relates the course of the proceedings, the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham, or Evesham Chronicle, also gives background information on the dispute. The litigation involved lands that the abbey held in Hampton and Bengeworth in Worcestershire, but that <b>the</b> <b>diocese</b> maintained were actually part of one of the bishopric's manors. Ownership became disputed under the abbacy of Æthelwig, when the abbot managed to acquire the allegiance of a number of the new owners of lands previously held from <b>the</b> <b>diocese.</b> After Æthelwig's death, most of these lands passed to Odo of Bayeux, but Evesham managed to retain Hampton and Bengeworth, which became the basis of the dispute. The lawsuit was complicated because part of the land had been granted by an earlier bishop, Beorhtheah, to a kinsman, Azur. After the Conquest, Azur's lands were given to Urse d'Abetot, the Sheriff of Worcester. Following Æthelwig's death, Wulfstan was able to secure a settlement with Æthelwig's successor Walter. The settlement, which was concluded in 1086, granted the lands to the abbey, but <b>the</b> <b>diocese</b> was the overlord of the lands, for which the abbey owed military service.|$|E

5|$|Badajoz is the see of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mérida-Badajoz.

The city has a degree of eminence, crowned as it is by {{the ruins of a}} Moorish castle and overlooking the Guadiana river, which flows between the castle-hill and the powerfully armed fort of San Cristobal. The architecture of Badajoz is indicative of its tempestuous history; even the Badajoz Cathedral, built in 1238, resembles a fortress, with its massive walls. Badajoz is home to the CD Badajoz and AD Cerro de Reyes football clubs and the AB Pacense basketball club. It is served by Badajoz Railway Station and Badajoz Airport.|$|E
