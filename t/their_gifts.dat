5|$|Jack and Liz {{decide to}} {{exchange}} gifts for Christmas. Meanwhile, Jack reconnects {{with a friend}} from high school, Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore), and ponders the possibility of romance as Nancy's marriage is falling apart. When Liz ends up buying an expensive necktie that Jack already owns, they agree to spend zero dollars on <b>their</b> <b>gifts.</b> Jack gets Liz a program from her performance of The Crucible framed in wood from her high school stage — and does not reimburse his office assistant, Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy) for fuel costs. In return, Liz calls in a bomb threat to Penn Station, keeping Nancy in New York, and finally Jack arranges for Liz to fulfill her dream of meeting Larry Wilcox as Officer Jon Baker from the show CHiPs.|$|E
5|$|Leopold {{wanted to}} begin the tour as soon as possiblethe younger the {{children}} were, the more spectacular would be the demonstration of <b>their</b> <b>gifts.</b> The route he intended to take included southern Germany, the Austrian Netherlands, Paris, Switzerland and possibly northern Italy. The London leg was only added after urgings during the Paris visit, and the eventual Dutch trip was an unplanned detour. The plan was to take in as many princely European courts as possible, {{as well as the}} great cultural capitals—Leopold was relying on his professional musical network and on his more recent social contacts to obtain invitations from the royal courts. Practical assistance came from Hagenauer, whose trading connections in the major cities would supply the Mozarts with what were effectively banking facilities. These would enable them to obtain money en route, while waiting for the proceeds from their performances to accumulate.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{begins with}} Emmon, a lowland runaway, coming to Caspromant when Orrec and Gry are 16. The {{children}} tell Emmon of <b>their</b> <b>gifts,</b> {{though he is}} somewhat disbelieving of them. Orrec then narrates the history of his family from his childhood. His father Canoc is the brantor of Caspromant; his mother Melle, a woman from the lowlands. Despite living in the Uplands, Melle holds to some of her traditions, and teaches Orrec stories and lays that she had learned as a child. She also teaches him to read, an ability rare among Uplanders. Canoc also begins to instruct Orrec {{in the use of}} their power, though Orrec does not manifest any ability as a child. Orrec and Gry, of a similar age, become good friends, and Gry begins to show her power, being able to listen to the speech of cats and mice.|$|E

5|$|Returning to the Temple of Hylia, Link is {{followed}} by Groose and the two {{end up on the}} Surface together. Link then has to defeat the Imprisoned, a monstrous form of Demise attempting to reach the Sealed Temple, after the old woman shows him a second dormant Time Gate. With the Imprisoned defeated, Link sets out to strengthen the Goddess Sword by passing trials set by the ancient Goddesses and using <b>their</b> <b>gifts</b> to find Sacred Flames to purify and strengthen the blade so the Time Gate can be awakened. Returning to find the Imprisoned attempting to break free, Link reseals it with help from Groose. Activating the Time Gate and traveling to the past, he finds Zelda and learns that she is the mortal reincarnation of Hylia: Hylia could not kill Demise and was too weakened from their battle to fend him off again, so she created the Goddess Sword and reincarnated as a mortal to find someone who would fulfill her duty by using the Triforce to wish Demise's destruction, as only mortals can use the artifact. Zelda then seals herself inside a crystal to strengthen the seal on Demise, after granting her power to the Goddess Sword, evolving it into the true Master Sword.|$|E

This Cave of the Magi is called Metopa in Greek.|$|E
25|$|The Community of Christ {{teaches that}} all Christians are called by <b>their</b> <b>gifts</b> and talents to the ministry, priesthood {{is seen as}} a {{particular}} expression of universal ministry to which all are called. Since 1984, the church has ordained both women and men to the priesthood. All offices are deemed equal in importance, but the duties and responsibilities of each differ.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in 2011 the Kabbalah Centre was {{put under}} {{investigation}} by the IRS and FBI for financial malfeasance, following the abandonment of the Raising Malawi school project with millions of donors' dollars unaccounted for. In 2012, a Kabbalah Centre charity, Spirituality for Kids, accepted a $600,000 donation from an 87-year-old woman who some claim had dementia. In November 2013, two lawsuits were filed by former donors alleging that <b>their</b> <b>gifts</b> were misused.|$|E
25|$|Molly Dancers and Cornish Guise Dancers, both of {{whom are}} usually {{traditionally}} associated with midwinter festivals, often use blacked faces as a disguise. As the Molly dancers wished to avoid being identified by the landlords and petty nobles, who were also usually the local Magistrates, when they played tricks on those who failed to be generous enough in <b>their</b> <b>gifts</b> to the dancers. And the Guise dancers (disguised dancers) also wished to avoid any punishment for their mocking songs embarrassing the local gentry.|$|E
25|$|In mid-November, Bayshore {{has its own}} Santa's Arrival, which {{consists}} of {{a wide array of}} entertainment for the whole family. This is usually the kick-off of the holiday shopping season in which the mall's hours are extended until 10 pm from Monday to Saturday except Sundays which keeps regular hours (although in previous years the mall also had extended hours on Sundays). During the last week of the Christmas rush, the mall is open until 11:00 pm. Other traditional features of the shopping centre at this period is the Gift Wrapping Service on the third level in which patrons can have <b>their</b> <b>gifts</b> wrapped. In 2013, Bayshore worked with the Senators Foundation raising over $10,000 during the Holiday season.|$|E

25|$|In 1951, President Duke Kimbrough McCall {{integrated}} the campus, {{in defiance}} of Kentucky state laws that established segregation at public facilities. Later, {{at the height of}} the Civil Rights Movement, Southern was the only SBC agency to host a visit by Baptist minister and civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King (1961). During King's address at SBTS he mentioned he had been to the seminary's chapel several times in the past when accompanying his mother, since King's mother was an organist for the Women's Auxiliary of the National Baptist Convention. As a result, many donors withheld <b>their</b> <b>gifts</b> to Southern, and some demanded McCall's resignation because Dr. King had spoken in the seminary chapel.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} pictorial {{representations of}} Jesus' Nativity come from sarcophagi in Rome and Southern Gaul of around this date. They are {{later than the}} first scenes of the Adoration of the Magi, which appears in the catacombs of Rome, where Early Christians buried their dead, often decorating {{the walls of the}} underground passages and vaults with paintings. Many of these predate the legalisation of Christian worship by the Emperor Constantine in the early 4th century. Typically the Magi move in step together, holding <b>their</b> <b>gifts</b> in front of them, towards a seated Virgin with Christ on her lap. They closely resemble the motif of tribute-bearers which is common in the art of most Mediterranean and Middle-Eastern cultures, and goes back at least two millennia earlier in the case of Egypt; in contemporary Roman art defeated barbarians carry golden wreaths towards an enthroned Emperor.|$|E
25|$|It {{was under}} the {{leadership}} of Dean Samuel B. Richmond, a statistician from Columbia University, who had been acting dean of Columbia Graduate School, that the school was named for Ralph and Lulu Owen (1977). In 1930, two years after graduating from Vanderbilt University, Ralph Owen became a founding member of Equitable Securities Corporation in Nashville. By 1950, the firm was recognized as the second largest investment banking firm in the United States. Equitable purchased controlling interest in American Express in 1949 and 1950, and Owen became American Express chairman (1960–68). Following the deaths of both Mr. and Mrs. Owen, their estates gave $33.5 million to The Owen School, said to be the largest gift to a U.S. business school at that time. That sum raised the total of <b>their</b> <b>gifts</b> to more than $62 million.|$|E

50|$|Blackhawk {{announced}} {{two major}} partnerships in 2015. The first was with Stockpile, to distribute <b>gift</b> cards on <b>their</b> behalf. The move {{was seen as}} innovative by the Palo Alto-based startup, as it allowed consumers to purchase a gift card that can be redeemed to open and fund an account with stock. By partnering with Blackhawk, Stockpile would sell <b>their</b> <b>gift</b> card products in retail stores already partnered with Blackhawk. Blackhawk and Samsung announced a partnership deal later the same year to allow gift cards to be integrated into Samsung Pay. The deal meant 50 global retailers would now have <b>their</b> <b>gift</b> cards accessible in Samsung's mobile wallet.|$|R

25|$|A general festival for all {{the provinces}} of Sweden is customarily held at Uppsala every nine years. Participation in this festival is {{required}} of everyone. Kings and their subjects, collectively and individually, send <b>their</b> <b>gifts</b> to Uppsala; - and – a thing more cruel than any punishment – those who have already adopted Christianity buy themselves off from these ceremonies. The sacrifice is as follows; of every kind of male creature, nine victims are offered. By the blood of these creatures it is the custom to appease the gods. Their bodies, moreover, are hanged in a grove which is adjacent to the temple. This grove is so sacred {{to the people that}} the separate trees in it are believed to be holy because of the death or putrefaction of the sacrificial victims. There even dogs and horses hang beside human beings. (A certain Christian {{told me that he had}} seen seventy-two of their bodies hanging up together.) The incantations, however, which are usually sung in the performance of a libation of this kind are numerous and disgraceful, and it is better not to speak of them.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the guests}} are three fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, {{who have come}} to bless the child with gifts. Flora and Fauna give <b>their</b> <b>gifts</b> of beauty and song, respectively. Before Merryweather is able to give her blessing, the evil fairy Maleficent appears, only to be told that she was not invited. Maleficent turns to leave, but when Queen Leah asks if she's offended, the evil fairy curses the princess, proclaiming that Aurora will grow in grace and beauty, but before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she will use her finger to touch the spindle of a {{spinning}} wheel and die. King Stefan and Queen Leah are horrified and beg the fairies to break the curse. Unfortunately, they are not strong enough to break it, but Merryweather uses her blessing to soften the curse so that instead of dying, Aurora will fall into a deep sleep from which she can only be awakened by true love's kiss. King Stefan, still fearful for his daughter's life, orders all spinning wheels in the kingdom to be burned. The fairies do not believe that will be enough to keep Aurora safe, and so they spirit her away to a woodcutter's cottage in the forest until the day of her sixteenth birthday.|$|E
