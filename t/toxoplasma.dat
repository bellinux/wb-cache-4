5|$|An {{exhibit at}} the San Diego Natural History Museum states that cat feces from urban runoff carry <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii parasites to the ocean and kill sea otters.|$|E
5|$|Another area {{of concern}} is California, where {{recovery}} began to fluctuate or decline in the late 1990s. Unusually high mortality rates amongst adult and subadult otters, particularly females, have been reported. In 2017 the US Geological Survey found a 3% drop in the sea otter population of the California coast. This number still keeps them on track for removal from the endangered species list, although just barely. Necropsies of dead sea otters indicate diseases, particularly <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii and acanthocephalan parasite infections, are major causes of sea otter mortality in California. The <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii parasite, which is often fatal to sea otters, is carried by wild and domestic cats and may be transmitted by domestic cat droppings flushed into the ocean via sewage systems. Although disease has clearly contributed {{to the deaths of}} many of California's sea otters, it is not known why the California population is apparently more affected by disease than populations in other areas.|$|E
5|$|Factors such as hypoxia and infection, or {{stress and}} {{malnutrition}} {{in the mother}} during fetal development, {{may result in a}} slight increase in the risk of schizophrenia later in life. People diagnosed with schizophrenia {{are more likely to have}} been born in winter or spring (at least in the northern hemisphere), which may be a result of increased rates of viral exposures in utero. The increased risk is about five to eight percent. Other infections during pregnancy or around the time of birth that may increase the risk include <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondi and Chlamydia.|$|E
5|$|Great spotted {{woodpeckers}} are hunted by woodland {{birds of}} prey such as the Eurasian sparrowhawk and the northern goshawk. This woodpecker is a host of the blood-feeding fly Carnus hemapterus, and its internal parasites may include the spiny-headed worm Prosthorhynchus transversus. Protozoans also occur, including the potentially fatal <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii, which causes toxoplasmosis. The great spotted woodpecker is the favoured host of the tapeworm Anomotaenia brevis.|$|E
5|$|The bobcat {{may have}} {{external}} parasites, mostly ticks and fleas, and often carries the parasites of its prey, {{especially those of}} rabbits and squirrels. Internal parasites (endoparasites) are especially common in bobcats. One study found an average infection rate of 52% from <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii, but with great regional variation. One mite in particular, Lynxacarus morlani, has to date been found only on the bobcat. Parasites' and diseases' role in the mortality of the bobcat is still unclear, but they may account for greater mortality than starvation, accidents, and predation.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} parasites {{can affect the}} lungs, {{including}} <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii, Strongyloides stercoralis, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Plasmodium malariae. These organisms typically enter the body through {{direct contact with the}} skin, ingestion, or via an insect vector. Except for Paragonimus westermani, most parasites do not affect specifically the lungs but involve the lungs secondarily to other sites. Some parasites, in particular those belonging to the Ascaris and Strongyloides genera, stimulate a strong eosinophilic reaction, which may result in eosinophilic pneumonia. In other infections, such as malaria, lung involvement is due primarily to cytokine-induced systemic inflammation. In the developed world these infections are most common in people returning from travel or in immigrants. Around the world, these infections are most common in the immunodeficient.|$|E
5|$|In 1974 he {{was ordained}} into the Church of the Eternal Source, a Kemetic Pagan group, but moved on again in 1977, when {{he founded the}} Minoan Brotherhood as a Wiccan {{tradition}} for gay and bisexual men. Turning to academia, from 1980 to 1985 he studied for a bachelor's degree in Classical archaeology at Hunter College, which he followed up with a master's degree in the subject at Bryn Mawr College from 1985 to 1988. Buczynski was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in 1988, and died from a related <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii infection the following year, converting to Roman Catholicism briefly beforehand. In 2012, the practicing Pagan Michael G. Lloyd published a biography of Buczynski entitled Bull of Heaven.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had wanted}} to study for a {{doctorate}} and proceed with a career in archaeology, Buczynski was dying. He became ill with the <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii parasite, which took advantage of his weakened immune system. He suffered partial paralysis on his right side as well as brain lesions, leaving him irritable and withdrawn, and required hospitalization. Upon release, he moved to Atlanta to be with Muto in January 1989. By this stage, he was unable to attend to basic tasks on his own, including eating and dressing himself, and required almost constant care, from both Muto and from carers based at St. Joseph Hospital. He began to talk with the hospital's Roman Catholic priest and finally decided to return to the faith of his birth, undertaking his confession of reconciliation in February. In March, his condition deteriorated, and he was admitted to the hospital, where he fell into a coma and died on the morning on Thursday, March 16.|$|E
5|$|Bears are parasitized by eighty {{species of}} parasites, {{including}} single-celled protozoans and gastro-intestinal worms, and nematodes and flukes in their heart, liver, lungs and bloodstream. Externally they have ticks, fleas and lice. A study of American black bears found seventeen species of endoparasite including the protozoan Sarcocystis, the parasitic worm Diphyllobothrium mansonoides, and the nematodes Dirofilaria immitis, Capillaria aerophila, Physaloptera sp., Strongyloides sp. and others. Of these, D. mansonoides and adult C. aerophila were causing pathological symptoms. By contrast, polar bears have few parasites; many parasitic species need a secondary, usually terrestrial, host, and the polar bear's life style {{is such that}} few alternative hosts exist in their environment. The protozoan <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii {{has been found in}} polar bears, and the nematode Trichinella nativa can cause a serious infection and decline in older polar bears. Bears in North America are sometimes infected by a Morbillivirus similar to the canine distemper virus. They are susceptible to infectious canine hepatitis (CAV-1), with free-living black bears dying rapidly of encephalitis and hepatitis.|$|E
5|$|Endoparasites {{known to}} infect wolves include {{protozoan}}s and helminths (flukes, tapeworms, roundworms and thorny-headed worms). Of 30,000 protozoan species, {{only a few}} have been recorded to infect wolves: Isospora, <b>Toxoplasma,</b> Sarcocystis, Babesia, and Giardia. Wolves may carry Neospora caninum, which is of particular concern to farmers, as the disease can be spread to livestock, with infected animals being 3–13 {{times more likely to}} miscarry than those not infected. Among flukes, the most common in North American wolves is Alaria, which infects small rodents and amphibians that are eaten by wolves. Upon reaching maturity, Alaria migrates to the wolf's intestine, but harms it little. Metorchis conjunctus, which enters wolves through eating fish, infects the wolf's liver or gall bladder, causing liver disease, inflammation of the pancreas, and emaciation. Most other fluke species reside in the wolf's intestine, though Paragonimus westermani lives in the lungs. Tapeworms are commonly found in wolves, as their primary hosts are ungulates, small mammals, and fish, which wolves feed upon. Tapeworms generally cause little harm in wolves, though this depends on the number and size of the parasites, and the sensitivity of the host. Symptoms often include constipation, toxic and allergic reactions, irritation of the intestinal mucosa, and malnutrition. Infections by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus in ungulate populations tend to increase in areas with high wolf densities, as wolves can shed Echinoccocus eggs in their feces onto grazing areas. Wolves can carry over 30 roundworm species, though most roundworm infections appear benign, depending on the number of worms and the age of the host. Ancylostoma caninum attaches itself on the intestinal wall to feed on the host's blood, and can cause hyperchromic anemia, emaciation, diarrhea, and possibly death. Toxocara canis, a hookworm known to infect wolf pups in utero, can cause intestinal irritation, bloating, vomiting, and diarrhea. Wolves may catch Dioctophyma renale from minks, which infects the kidneys, and can grow to lengths of 100cm. D. renale causes the complete destruction of the kidney's functional tissue, and can be fatal if both kidneys are infected. Wolves can tolerate low levels of Dirofilaria immitis for many years without showing any ill effects, though high levels can kill wolves through cardiac enlargement and congestive hepatopathy. Wolves probably become infected with Trichinella spiralis by eating infected ungulates. Although T. spiralis isn't known to produce clinical signs in wolves, it can cause emaciation, salivation, and crippling muscle pains in dogs. Thorny-headed worms rarely infect wolves, though three species have been identified in Russian wolves: Nicolla skrjabini, Macrocantorhynchus catulinus, and Moniliformis moniliformis.|$|E
25|$|It {{appears that}} Besnoitia, Hammondia, Neospora and <b>Toxoplasma</b> form a single clade. Within this clade <b>Toxoplasma</b> and Neospora {{appear to be}} sister clades. Isospora also appear to belong to this clade and this clade is a sister to Sarcocystis. Frenkelia appears to be very closely related to Sarcocystis.|$|E
25|$|Related genera include: Besnoitia, Caryospora, Cystoisospora, Frenkelia, Isospora, Hammondia, Hyaloklossia, Lankesterella, Neospora and <b>Toxoplasma.</b>|$|E
25|$|As of 2016, no {{approved}} human vaccine exists against <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii. Research {{on human}} vaccines is ongoing.|$|E
25|$|Glyphosate {{can control}} the growth of apicomplexan parasites, such as <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii, Plasmodium falciparum (malaria), and Cryptosporidium parvum, and has been {{considered}} an antimicrobial agent in mammals.|$|E
25|$|Complications {{may occur}} {{due to the}} {{substance}} consumed. For example, lead poisoning may result from the ingestion of paint or paint-soaked plaster, hairballs may cause intestinal obstruction and <b>Toxoplasma</b> or Toxocara infections may follow ingestion of feces or dirt.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} other genera of heteroxenous and cyst-forming coccidia {{including}} Besnoitia, Cystoisospora, Frenkelia, Hammondia, Neospora and <b>Toxoplasma.</b> Related but monoxenous spore forming genera include Isospora. Differentiating these genera from Sarcocystis in diagnostic material {{may be difficult}} without immunochemical stains.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} some {{inconsistent}} findings of links between infection by the parasite <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii and human mental disorders such as schizophrenia, with the direction of causality unclear. A number of diseases of the white matter can cause symptoms of mental disorder.|$|E
25|$|A seven-year-old female named Jin Yi died in 2014 in a zoo in Zhengzhou, China, after showing {{symptoms}} of gastroenteritis and respiratory disease. It {{was found that}} {{the cause of death was}} toxoplasmosis, a disease caused by <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii and infecting most warm-blooded animals, including humans.|$|E
25|$|The {{onset of}} Wain's {{schizophrenia}} {{may have been}} precipitated by <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii, a parasite which is excreted by cats in their feces. The theory that toxoplasmosis can trigger schizophrenia {{is the subject of}} ongoing research, though the origins of the theory can be traced back as early as 1953.|$|E
25|$|<b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii {{has been}} {{reported}} {{as the cause of}} death of a Giant panda kept in a zoo in China, who died in 2014 of acute gastroenteritis and respiratory disease. Although seemingly anecdotal, this report emphasizes that all warm-blooded species are likely to be infected by T. gondii, including endangered species such as the Giant panda.|$|E
25|$|Biosafety level 2 is {{suitable}} for work involving agents of moderate potential hazard to personnel and the environment. This includes various microbes that cause mild disease to humans, or are difficult to contract via aerosol in a lab setting. Examples include Hepatitis A, B, and C viruses, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), pathogenic Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Plasmodium falciparum, and <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii.|$|E
25|$|Wild rodents, {{including}} rats, {{can carry}} many different zoonotic pathogens, such as Leptospira, <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii, and Campylobacter. The Black Death is traditionally {{believed to have}} been caused by the micro-organism Yersinia pestis, carried by the tropical rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis) which preyed on black rats living in European cities during the epidemic outbreaks of the Middle Ages; these rats were used as transport hosts. Another zoonotic disease linked to the rat is the foot-and-mouth disease.|$|E
25|$|This {{species can}} {{also serve as}} a {{reservoir}} for <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii, the parasite that causes toxoplasmosis, though the disease usually spreads from rats to humans when domestic cats feed on infected brown rats. The parasite has a long history with the brown rat, and there are indications that the parasite has evolved to alter an infected rat's perception to cat predation, making it more susceptible to predation and increasing the likelihood of transmission.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{infectious}} diseases can be transmitted either congenitally (before or at birth), and can cause serious neurodevelopmental problems, as for example the viruses HSV, CMV, rubella (congenital rubella syndrome), Zika virus, or bacteria like Treponema pallidum in congenital syphilis, which may progress to neurosyphilis if it remains untreated. Protozoa like Plasmodium or <b>Toxoplasma</b> which can cause congenital toxoplasmosis with multiple cysts {{in the brain and}} other organs, leading to a variety of neurological deficits.|$|E
25|$|Toxoplasmosis is a {{parasitic}} disease caused by <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii. Infections with toxoplasmosis usually cause no obvious symptoms in adults. Occasionally {{there may be}} a few weeks or months of mild flu-like illness such as muscle aches and tender lymph nodes. In a small number of people, eye problems may develop. In those with a weak immune system, severe symptoms such as seizures and poor coordination may occur. If infected during pregnancy, a condition known as congenital toxoplasmosis may affect the child.|$|E
25|$|Some parasites modify host {{behavior}} {{in order to}} increase the transmission between hosts, often in relation to predator and prey (parasite increased trophic transmission). For example, in California salt marshes, the fluke Euhaplorchis californiensis reduces the ability of its killifish host to avoid predators. This parasite matures in egrets, which are more likely to feed on infected killifish than on uninfected fish. Another example is the protozoan <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii, a parasite that matures in cats but can be carried by many other mammals. Uninfected rats avoid cat odors, but rats infected with T. gondii are drawn to this scent, which may increase transmission to feline hosts.|$|E
25|$|Hepatitis {{can also}} occur in {{neonates}} and {{is attributable to}} a variety of causes, some of which are not typically seen in adults. Congenital or perinatal infection with the hepatitis viruses, <b>toxoplasma,</b> rubella, cytomegalovirus, and syphilis can cause neonatal hepatitis. Structural abnormalities such as biliary atresia and choledochal cysts can lead to cholestatic liver injury leading to neonatal hepatitis. Metabolic diseases such as glycogen storage disorders and lysosomal storage disorders are also implicated. Neonatal hepatitis can be idiopathic, and in such cases, biopsy often shows large multinucleated cells in the liver tissue. This disease is termed giant cell hepatitis and may be associated with viral infection, autoimmune disorders, and drug toxicity.|$|E
25|$|Changes {{in rates}} {{and types of}} {{infection}} alone however, {{have been unable to}} explain the observed increase in allergic disease, and recent evidence has focused attention on the importance of the gastrointestinal microbial environment. Evidence has shown that exposure to food and fecal-oral pathogens, such as hepatitis A, <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii, and Helicobacter pylori (which also tend to be more prevalent in developing countries), can reduce the overall risk of atopy by more than 60%, and an increased rate of parasitic infections has been associated with a decreased prevalence of asthma. It is speculated that these infections exert their effect by critically altering TH1/TH2 regulation. Important elements of newer hygiene hypotheses also include exposure to endotoxins, exposure to pets and growing up on a farm.|$|E
25|$|The blood–brain barrier acts very {{effectively}} {{to protect the}} brain from most pathogens. Thus, blood-borne infections of the brain are very rare. Infections {{of the brain that}} do occur are often very serious and difficult to treat. Antibodies are too large to cross the blood–brain barrier, and only certain antibiotics are able to pass. In some cases, a drug has to be administered directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where it can enter the brain by crossing the blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier. However, not all drugs that are delivered directly to the CSF can effectively penetrate the CSF barrier and enter the brain. The blood–brain barrier becomes more permeable during inflammation. This allows some antibiotics and phagocytes to move across the BBB. However, this also allows bacteria and viruses to infiltrate the BBB. Examples of pathogens that can traverse the BBB and the diseases they cause include <b>toxoplasma</b> gondii which causes toxoplasmosis, spirochetes like Borrelia which causes Lyme disease, Group B streptococci which causes meningitis in newborns, and Treponema pallidum which causes syphilis. Some of these harmful bacteria gain access by releasing cytotoxins like pneumolysin which have a direct toxic effect on brain microvascular endothelium and tight junctions.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{studying}} 553 feral cats in Northern Florida in the United States tested {{them for}} a number of infections that could be detrimental to feline or human health. The study found the most prevalent infection to be Bartonella henselae, the cause of cat-scratch disease in humans, with 33.6% of the cats testing positive. Feline coronavirus was the next most common infection, found in 18.3% of the cats, although they noted that the antibody levels were low in most of the cats who tested positive, and concluded that the cats they tested {{did not appear to be}} a greater risk for shedding the virus than pet cats. Researchers studying 96 feral cats on Prince Edward Island in Canada found that feline roundworm was the most common infection in cats in that colony, afflicting 34% of cats. This was followed by <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii, which was detected in 29.8% of cats, although only one cat of the 78 for whom fecal samples were available was shedding T. gondii oocysts. They did note that most fecal samples collected indicated the presence of one intestinal parasite, with some samples indicating the presence of multiple parasites.|$|E
500|$|An {{emaciated}} [...] female fin whale, which stranded {{along the}} Belgian coast in 1997, {{was found to}} be infected with lesions of Morbillivirus. In January 2011, a [...] emaciated adult male fin whale stranded dead on the Tyrrhenian coastline of Italy {{was found to be}} infected with [...] Morbillivirus and the protozoa <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii, as well as carrying heavy loads of organochlorine pollutants.|$|E
500|$|Life expectancies may {{be up to}} 20–25 years. [...] Parapoxvirus is common, though rarely fatal; Infection causes papular and nodular lesions. There {{have been}} {{epidemics}} of contagious pustular dermatitis. [...] Bacteria such as E.coli and Lyme borreliosis are common, and <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii has been reported. [...] C.crispus is susceptible to numerous parasites, such as the nematode Trichuris discolor and the lungworm Protostrongylus shiozawai.|$|E
500|$|Some {{survival}} strategies often involve disrupting cytokines {{and other}} methods of cell signaling {{to prevent the}} phagocyte's [...] responding to invasion. The protozoan parasites <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania infect macrophages, and each has a unique way of taming them. Some species of Leishmania alter the infected macrophage's signalling, repress the production of cytokines and microbicidal molecules—nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species—and compromise antigen presentation.|$|E
500|$|The {{eggs and}} chicks of red-billed tropicbirds are prey for both brown and black rats {{in places like}} Abrolhos Archipelago, where these rats are {{invasive}} species. Feral cats are also predators of breeding tropicbirds, with the birds providing about 3% of the diet of the cats in locations such as the Caribbean island Saba. On Saba, the problem has only arisen since about 2000. On Ascension Island, {{the effect of the}} eradication of feral cats was the increase of the red-billed tropicbird population there by about 1.6% in a year. [...] On the Galapagos Islands, the short-eared owl (Asio flammeus) [...] occasionally eats young birds. <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii, an intracellular parasite, can be found in this bird. About 28% of red-billed tropicbirds produce antibodies for T. gondii.|$|E
500|$|The fossa {{has been}} {{assessed}} as [...] "Vulnerable" [...] by the IUCN Red List since 2008, as its population size has probably declined {{by at least}} 30percent between 1987 and 2008; previous assessments have included [...] "Endangered" [...] (2000) and [...] "Insufficiently Known" [...] (1988, 1990, 1994). The species is dependent on forest and thus threatened by the widespread destruction of Madagascar's native forest but is also able to persist in disturbed areas. A suite of microsatellite markers (short segments of DNA that have a repeated sequence) {{have been developed to}} help aid in studies of genetic health and population dynamics of both captive and wild fossas. Several pathogens have been isolated from the fossa, some of which, such as anthrax and canine distemper, are thought to have been transmitted by feral dogs or cats. <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii was reported in a captive fossa in 2013.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Torrey became {{interested}} in viral infections as possible causes of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, particularly a parasite <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii whose definitive host is the cat, but whose intermediate host can be any mammal, including humans. Up to {{one third of the}} world's human population is estimated to carry a <b>Toxoplasma</b> infection. Since then he has published, often with Robert Yolken, more than 30 articles on seasonal variation and possible infectious causes of schizophrenia, focusing especially on <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii. He is involved in five or six ongoing studies using anti-Toxoplasmosa gondii agents (e.g. antibiotics such as minocycline and azithromycin) as an add-on treatment for schizophrenia. He believes that infectious causes will eventually explain the [...] "vast majority" [...] of schizophrenia cases. Some of his collaborators have disagreed with the emphasis he has placed on infection as a direct causal factor. Many of the research studies on links between schizophrenia and <b>Toxoplasma</b> gondii, by different authors in different countries, are funded and supported by the Stanley Medical Research Institute. The hypothesis is not prominent in current mainstream scientific views on the causes of schizophrenia, although infections may be seen as one possible risk factor that could lead to vulnerabilities in early neurodevelopment in some cases.|$|E
