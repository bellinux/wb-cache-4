5|$|Having {{failed to}} cut the French line at his first attempt, Howe reissued the order at 12:30. Once more Caesar was to lead the way, with the {{intention}} of splitting the enemy fleet in half. Captain Molloy then refused to carry out the order, signalling without cause that Caesar was unable to tack and then turning and sailing eastwards down <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British fleet, rather than towards the enemy. This unexpected move threw the following ships into a state of confusion; Queen, coming behind Caesar, attempted to obey Howe's signal alone but was badly damaged by shot, and her captain John Hutt mortally wounded. Unable to effectively manoeuvre, Queen passed down <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French line, firing as she went.|$|E
5|$|Initially the old {{tower was}} {{converted}} into a stronger keep which was able to support artillery guns on its roof, a gatehouse was built alongside it, four stirrup towers – so-called because of their shape – a curtain wall was constructed around <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle, and bastions erected around the wall. Towards {{the end of this}} phase of work the castle was altered in a frantic burst of work, possibly driven on by pressure from the King himself. The height of the curtain wall was increased, the gatehouse extended into an entrance bastion, a new network of underground passages installed, and foreworks added around <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bastions. By the end of 1540 the castle was garrisoned with 17 men and equipped with artillery, with Chute appointed as its captain.|$|E

5|$|Almost all the shrines are nondescript small {{rectangular}} buildings {{without any}} ornamentation.

Almost all shrines are built of stone except that one dedicated to Valli which shows timber construction. They have been left as originally constructed and there are not any plans to improve upon them, because people are reluctant to tamper with the original shrine complex.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{had been}} raised that the {{radiation}} belt produced in orbit by the recent Operation Dominic nuclear tests would be dangerous to manned space missions, but an extensive study announced in early September declared that {{it was safe to}} fly. While <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capsule was expected to receive a dosage of around 500 röntgens, the study concluded that shielding and the effect of the spacecraft structure would reduce this to around 8 röntgens experienced by the astronaut, well within established tolerance limits.|$|E
50|$|The Church-managed {{hospitals}} and cemeteries forced people to bury dead people with lime at <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> cities. <b>The</b> isolation <b>of</b> sick people in hospitals or charities at <b>the</b> <b>outsides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cities was another important measure {{to stop the}} smallpox infection.

Although inoculation was practiced, <b>the</b> miasma theory <b>of</b> disease was still believed.|$|R

The inside of the bailey still shows the marks of former strip farming, which can be seen in winter.|$|E
5|$|Feit {{initially}} denied hearing Garza's confession in the rectory, but {{he later}} {{admitted to having}} done so. He accounted for his absence from the sanctuary by explaining that he had broken his glasses that night; {{he said that he}} often played with his glasses nervously as he listened to confession. Feit said that he had driven back to the pastoral house to get another pair of glasses, and when he arrived he had no key, so he had to climb into the house on the second floor. He said that he sustained the scratches on his hands as was climbing <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brick structure.|$|E

5|$|In {{accordance}} with their expected mission, the boats could transport up to six naval commandos armed with 612 M-66 or M-71 limpet mines.

Four R-1 swimmer delivery vehicles could be carried {{in place of the}} AIM-70/71 mines.
