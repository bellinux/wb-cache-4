50|$|In {{addition}} to other common impedance matching {{techniques such as}} a gamma match, <b>transmitting</b> <b>loops</b> are sometimes impedance matched by connecting the feedline to a smaller feed loop inside the area surrounded by the main loop. Typical feed loops are 1/8 to 1/5 {{the size of the}} antenna's main loop. The combination is in effect a transformer, with power in the near-field inductively coupled from the feed loop to the main loop, which itself is connected to the resonating capacitor and is responsible for radiating most of the power.|$|R
50|$|A {{loop antenna}} is a closed circuit radio antenna, {{consisting}} of a loop or coil of wire, tubing, or other electrical conductor ideally fed by a balanced source or feeding a balanced load. Within this physical description there are two distinct antenna types: The large resonant loop antenna with a circumference close to one wavelength and the small loop which when used only for receive on low frequencies can {{be as little as}} 1% of a wavelength in circumference, but when used for transmission is typically about 5 to 30% of a wavelength in circumference. Most loop antennas are resonated to the operating frequency. The full wavelength loop is self resonant, small <b>transmitting</b> <b>loops</b> use a series capacitor to achieve resonance and the small receiving loop uses multiple turns and a parallel capacitor which resonates with the net inductance of the loop itself.|$|R

In this paper, we look into the performance of closed <b>loop</b> <b>transmit</b> diversity schemes in the downlink of a WCDMA systems release 4. More specifically, we compare by simulations in a very realistic environment the mode 1 and mode 2 performance of the FBTD scheme. The resulting simulation curves show (i) the effect of varying mobile speeds on the performance of the two modes of FBTD with and without fast closed loop power control, (ii) the impact of channel estimation errors on the average bit error rate (BER), and (iii) the consequences of errors in the feedback path between receiver and transmitter...|$|R
50|$|The small <b>transmitting</b> <b>loop</b> {{works very}} well for {{reception}} especially on the lower frequencies. Although the losses can be high, the {{signal to noise ratio}} may not suffer assuming a loop diameter of at least 1 or 2 meters, regardless of the operating frequency. The very high Q rejects any potential off frequency interference or overload but also dictates that even for receive the loop must be carefully tuned to the exact frequency. The ability to rotate may help reject either local noise or distant interference.|$|E
50|$|Although {{it has a}} superficially similar appearance, the {{so-called}} halo antenna is not technically a loop since it possesses {{a break in the}} conductor opposite the feed point. It is better analyzed as a dipole which has been bent into a circle. However if we consider that small currents flow between the closely spaced ends of the dipole, the halo {{can be viewed as a}} small <b>transmitting</b> <b>loop</b> in the limiting case where the resonating capacitor has been reduced to a very small value as the circumference has increased to about one half wave.|$|E

[...] In a typical setup the <b>transmitting</b> <b>loop,</b> consisting of many turns of copper wire, is oriented horizontally within the cave using a spirit level, and driven at a few kHz. Though such a small antenna is a very poor radiator of propagating radio waves at this low frequency, its local AC magnetic field is strong enough to be detected by a similar receiving antenna up to a few hundred meters away. The received signal's strength and its dependence on orientation of the receiving coil yields approximate distance and directional information.|$|E

5000|$|These loops {{are small}} in {{comparison}} to the full wave loop, typically between 5% and 30% of a wavelength in circumference but considerably larger than the small receiving loop. They are typically used on frequencies between 3 and 30 MHz. They usually consist of a single turn of large diameter conductor, and are typically round or octagonal to provide maximum enclosed area for a given perimeter. The smaller of these loops show efficiencies well below that of the self resonant loops, but where space is at a premium, can provide effective communications. Loop antennas are relatively easy to build. A small <b>transmitting</b> <b>loop</b> antenna, also known as a magnetic loop,with a circumference 10% of a wavelength or less, will have a relatively constant current distribution along the conductor, and the main lobe will be in the plane of the loop. Loops of any size between 10% and 100% of a wavelength in circumference can be built and tuned to resonance with series reactance. A capacitor is required for a circumference less than a half wave, an inductor for loops more than a half wave and less than a full wave. Loops in this size range may have neither the uniform current of the small loop, nor the double peaked current of the full sized loop and thus cannot be analyzed using the concepts developed for the small receiving loops nor the self resonant loop antennas. Performance is best determined with NEC analysis. Antennas within this size range include the halo (see below) and the G0CWT (Edginton) loop.|$|E

40|$|Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and implantable {{biomedical}} devices need efficient {{power and}} data transfer with very low profile antennas. We propose {{a low profile}} electrically small antenna for near-field wireless power and data telemetry employing a metamaterial Split Ring Resonator (SRR) antenna. SRRs can be designed for operation over wide frequencies from RF to visible. However, they are inherently narrowband making them sensitive to component mismatch with respect to external transmit antenna. Here we propose an embedding of a non-foster impedance circuitry into the metamaterial SRR structure that imparts conjugate negative complex impedance to this resonator antenna thereby increasing the effective bandwidth and thus overcoming the fundamental limit for efficient signal coupling. We demonstrate the concept through extensive numerical simulations and a prototype system at the board level using discrete off-the-shelf components and printed circuit SRR antenna at 500 MHz. We show that the power transfer between SRR receive antenna and the external <b>transmit</b> <b>loop</b> antenna is broadened by almost 400 MHz which corresponds to increase in Δf/fC from 0. 49 to 1. 65, before and after non-foster circuit activation.

40|$|International audienceARLETT is a three-component surface-to-borehole {{harmonic}} electromagnetic (EM) system {{developed by}} BRGM mainly for deep mineral exploration. The probe contains three magnetometers and two inclinometers, {{which makes it}} possible to project the EM fields onto a fixed coordinate system and to independently calculate the borehole trajectory. The system has a low internal noise level, high spectral resolution, and effective noise-rejection and signal-processing capabilities. Conductive targets can be detected directly on the recorded logs of the total EM field, particularly using the phases of the field components and the ellipticity. Locating these targets requires reduction of the data to remove the primary field (of the <b>transmitting</b> <b>loop)</b> and retain the (usually much smaller) secondary field of the target. The reduced data then are matched to the field of a simple 3 -D current filament. The ARLETT system has been tested in the Sudbury Basin, which has highly conductive targets in a resistive environment, and in the Iberian Pyrite Belt, which has moderately conductive targets in a (less) conductive host.

5000|$|STTD {{is one of}} {{numerous}} open <b>loop</b> <b>transmit</b> diversity schemes which also include Phase Switched Transmit Diversity (PSTD), Time Switched Diversity (TSTD), Orthogonal Transmit Diversity (OTD) and Space Time Spreading (STS) 1. The aim {{of all of these}} schemes is to smooth the Rayleigh fading and drop out effects observed when using only a single antenna at both ends of a radio link in a Multipath propagation environment. Diversity improves link reliability for each user over time, especially near cell edges (in the absence of soft handoff), and also the average performance of an ensemble of users at any particular instant. Not being reliant on slow channel-state feedback from the mobile (i.e. user equipment) means that open loop STTD is almost immune to Doppler shifts associated with high UE speeds and is the preferred method for this scenario. However, an open <b>loop</b> <b>transmit</b> diversity scheme must not degrade performance for a user close to the base station where the channels may be line of sight and nearly ideal. Since STTD is an orthogonal coding system this is also guaranteed.|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{electromagnetic}} (EM) imaging, in particular in borehole applications, can be effective in characterizing and monitoring subsurface processes involved in improved oil recovery operations and production management. In this report the authors present an innovative EM method for extracting information about a steel casing in terms of its electrical conductivity, magnetic permeability, and the casing thickness. The method is based on accurate evaluation of magnetic fields near the <b>transmitting</b> <b>loop</b> in a steel-cased borehole, and the least squares inversion of thus measured data. The need to make measurements close to the source stems from the two related considerations. One reason is that by making measurements close to the transmitter one can keep the formation response from entering the measurement to a minimum. The other reason concerns with the practical consideration involved in fabricating a borehole tool. The measurement accuracy in terms of PPM to the primary field can best be achieved when the transmitter and receiver are close to each other. To facilitate this requirement one can consider a single loop acting as the source and the receiver operating in time domain, or a closely coupled frequency-domain system with the source-receiver separation of just a few inches apart.

40|$|In this paper, two {{numerical}} {{models are}} presented to simulate an enhanced very early time electromagnetic (VETEM) prototype system, {{which is used}} for buried-object detection and environmental problems. Usually, the VETEM system contains a <b>transmitting</b> <b>loop</b> antenna and a receiving loop antenna, which run on a lossy ground to detect buried objects. In the first numerical model, the loop antennas are accurately analyzed using the Method of Moments (MoM) for wire antennas above or buried in lossy ground. Then, Conjugate Gradient (CG) methods, {{with the use of}} the fast Fourier transform (FFT) or MoM, are applied to investigate the scattering from buried objects. Reflected and scattered magnetic fields are evaluated at the receiving loop to calculate the output electric current. However, the working frequency for the VETEM system is usually low and, hence, two magnetic dipoles are used to replace the transmitter and receiver in the second numerical model. Comparing these two models, the second one is simple, but only valid for low frequency or small loops, while the first modeling is more general. In this paper, all computations are performed in the frequency domain, and the FFT is used to obtain the time-domain responses. Numerical examples show that simulation results from these two models fit very well when the frequency ranges from 10 kHz to 10 MHz, and both results are close to the measured data. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} a new enhanced very early time electromagnetic (VETEM) prototype system are presented, where a horizontal <b>transmitting</b> <b>loop</b> and two horizontal receiving loops are used to detect buried targets, in which three loops share the same axis and the transmitter {{is located at the}} center of receivers. In the new VETEM system, the difference of signals from two receivers is taken to eliminate strong direct-signals from the transmitter and background clutter and furthermore to obtain a better SNR for buried targets. Because strong coupling exists between the transmitter and receivers, accurate analysis of the three-loop antenna system is required, for which a loop-tree basis function method has been utilized to overcome the low-frequency breakdown problem. In the analysis of scattering problem from buried targets, a conjugate gradient (CG) method with fast Fourier transform (FFT) is applied to solve the electric field integral equation. However, the convergence of such CG-FFT algorithm is extremely slow at very low frequencies. In order to increase the convergence rate, a frequency-hopping approach has been used. Finally, the primary, coupling, reflected, and scattered magnetic fields are evaluated at receiving loops to calculate the output electric current. Numerous simulation results are given to interpret the new VETEM system. Comparing with other single-transmitter-receiver systems, the new VETEM has better SNR and ability to reduce the clutter. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
