40|$|With {{the advent}} of the Montreal Protocol came a new {{international}} awareness towards process chemicals and their environmental impact. Waste and chemical minimization have become major factors in choosing long-term halogenated solvent alternatives. As the electronics industry converts to semi-aqueous and aqueous methods of post-solder cleaning, the importance of water recycling and water quality will significantly increase. A recent development in semi-aqueous terpene cleaning has made it quite easy and convenient to minimize waste effluent. A second generation terpene product, which separates immediately from rinse water under semi-static holding conditions, allows for either convenient discharge or easy water recycling. This major advancement in terpene cleaning allows the assembler to economically achieve essentially zero discharge. Semi-aqueous terpene closed-loop water recycling systems are now in operation and available from most semi-aqueous equipment vendors [...] I. Kc€QDUcrI ON Semi-aqueous t rpene cleaning [...] systems re now recognized as one of the-best alternatives to ozone depleting halogenated solvents in electronics cleaning applications. Semi-aqueous cleaning can best be defined as a method in which there are essentially two ste s: a water-immiscible solvent wash followed by an aqueous rinse. ' This combination cleaning approach provides outstanding performance results, particularly in ionic cleanliness and surface insulation resistance (SIR). The aqueous rinse is mandatory due to the very low vapor pressure of <b>terpene</b> <b>solvent</b> and the need to accomplish the cleaning task in the same time and space as traditional solvent processes. Semi-aqueous processes are always followed by a drying stage comprised of forced air and radiant heat. Because semi-aqueous terpene cleaning demands aqueous rinsing, the volumes of water required and quality of water necessary have become concerns as they are for ordinary aqueous cleaning. Fo...|$|E

40|$|Transdermal uptake {{directly}} from air is a potentially important yet largely overlooked pathway for human exposure to organic vapors indoors. We recently reported (Indoor Air 2012, 22, 356) that transdermal uptake {{directly from}} air could be comparable to or larger than intake via inhalation for many semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs). Here, we extend that analysis to approximately eighty organic compounds that (a) occur commonly indoors and (b) are {{primarily in the}} gas-phase rather than being associated with particles. For some compounds, the modeled ratio of dermal-to-inhalation uptake is large. In this group are common parabens, lower molecular weight phthalates, o-phenylphenol, Texanol, ethylene glycol, and α-terpineol. For other compounds, estimated dermal uptakes are small compared to inhalation. Examples include aliphatic hydrocarbons, single ring aromatics, <b>terpenes,</b> chlorinated <b>solvents,</b> formaldehyde, and acrolein. Analysis of published experimental data for human subjects for twenty different organic compounds substantiates these model predictions. However, transdermal uptake rates from air have not been measured for the indoor organics that have the largest modeled ratios of dermal-to-inhalation uptake; for such compounds, the estimates reported here require experimental verification. In accounting for total exposure to indoor organic pollutants and in assessing potential health consequences of such exposures, {{it is important to}} consider direct transdermal absorption from air. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|Larger and {{increasing}} volumes of plastics are produced yearly {{due to their}} low price, versatility and suitability for {{a large number of}} applications and uses. Unfortunately, after its use, polymers become a valuable feedstock and they must be recovered in order to prevent the environmental pollution and to preserve natural sources following the mandates of the European policies about wastes management. In fact, during the last decade, some positive trends concerning the recovery and recycling of polymers are occurring. The recycling of plastic wastes is justified enough on environmentally basis, but also is demonstrated that presents a large potential from an economical point reducing the pressure on the original sources of raw materials. The use of plastic wastes as source of high-added value products impulse the recycling alternative being a great environmental opportunity by several reasons: the reduction of the pressure on the exploitation of raw materials, resources and energy consumption, the increase of free volume in landfills, and obviously, the associated benefits (employment and lower prices). This research work is focused on the recycling of Polystyrene (PS) wastes by an environmentally friendly technology for the production of high-added value products. The mentioned polymer constituted and important issue since it is not biodegradable, massive amounts of energy and resource are consumed during its production, is very versatile. As it is used in daily life application with very low lifespan, it makes that frequently finish in landfills or in small pieces in seas and oceans. In order to promote the recycling of Polystyrene wastes, new processes should be designed to reduce the environmental impacts and costs and {{to improve the quality of}} the recovered products regarding to the traditional recycling techniques (mechanical recycling, chemical recycling or energy recovery). Thus, a technology according to the Green Chemistry principles is proposed. The new recycling process for Polystyrene wastes consists on the dissolution of the polymer in natural <b>terpene</b> <b>solvents</b> to reduce its volume (decreasing transport costs), remove contaminants, dissolve specifically the polymer from mixed plastic waste streams, avoiding its degradation. Next, the separation of the terpenes from the solutions is performed by the addition of high pressure CO 2 as antisolvent which makes that the polymer precipitates while the solvent is removed. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) has been the choice antisolvent because it is able to solubilise terpenes easily and thank to its sorption in the polymer, the processing is enhanced. Furthermore, CO 2 has resulted to be a very promising blowing agent which encourages its use for the production of microcellular foams, a high-added value product. Moreover, it should be highlighted that any waste stream from the process is obtained because the terpenes and the CO 2 are easily recovered and reused in several cycles of the process, minimizing the environmental impact. As the objective is to create new products with higher added value than the original raw material using a residue, is necessary to know the interaction between Polystyrene, <b>terpene</b> <b>solvents</b> and high pressure CO 2 to anticipate the conditions in which the removal of the solvent has to be done to produce improved new materials. The research started up with the definition of the binary systems which makes the different steps of the process. Thus, in order to determine the maximum amount of treated wastes with a certain amount of solvent, the influence of the temperature, the molecular weight and the source of the Polystyrene wastes (Expanded or Extruded) on the solubility in terpenes was studied. It was concluded that <b>terpenes</b> are suitable <b>solvents</b> for the dissolution of the polymer at room temperature independently of its molecular weight and processing. On the other hand, the solubility of terpenes in CO 2 is crucial since the success of the separation process depends on it. It was observed that terpenes are fully soluble in CO 2 at room temperature and mild pressure. Finally, although Polystyrene is insoluble in CO 2, the gas is greatly absorbed into the polymer causing its swelling and plasticization. This phenomenon entails a modification of the Polystyrene properties (viscosity, interfacial tension and glass transition temperature), which affects the processing of the polymer at high pressure. Once the binary systems had been defined and studied, it is important to know the behaviour of the ternary mixtures involved in the process (CO 2 /terpenes/Polystyrene) since the knowledge of the binary systems is not enough to select the operating conditions successfully. According to the binary system, the solvent removal is possible thanks to supercritical CO 2 since it provides high solubility of terpenes and fully PS insolubility at moderated pressures and temperature. The influence of pressure, temperature and concentration on the solubility of the selected terpenes (Limonene and p-Cymene) in CO 2 and on the sorption of CO 2 into the solutions (Polystyrene/Limonene and Polystyrene/p-Cymene) were determined. From these results, the most suitable conditions for the precipitation of Polystyrene using CO 2 as antisolvent were those where the antisolvent density was higher (high pressure and low temperature) and the concentration of Polystyrene in the solutions moderated. Next, the properties of the mixtures were determined since the knowledge of the phases equilibrium is too poor to define the global process. The plasticizing effect of CO 2 on the polymer is also observed in terpene solutions and consequently, a deep understanding of how the properties of materials and the processing parameters affect the behaviour of the mixtures is required. The study of the viscosity, interfacial tension and glass transition temperature of the mixtures was carried out. Although the viscosity and the interfacial tension of the ternary systems were significantly affected by the antisolvent, the glass transition temperature showed similar results to those obtained for the binary system Polystyrene/CO 2. Once the system was characterized and the equilibrium and properties of the ternary mixtures determined, the recycling process was studied. Two main alternatives were explored: continuous or discontinuous regime. In continuous regime, named Supercritical Antisolvent (SAS) the polymer solution is sprayed to a vessel previously filled with CO 2. This process allows the control over the particle size. Nevertheless, Polystyrene is precipitated according to a wide variety of morphologies and the knowledge of the hydrodynamic of the system was crucial to understand the process. Thus, the way in which the polymer solution is contacted with CO 2 affects the diffusion and mixing of the fluids and consequently the way on which the polymer precipitates. Due to the technical difficulties found along the development of the SAS process, the discontinuous one was proposed as alternative, which is focused on the foaming of the solution for the production of Polystyrene microcellular foams. In this case, CO 2 behaves not only as <b>solvent</b> of the <b>terpene</b> and antisolvent of the Polystyrene, but also as blowing agent of the polymer, which allows tuning the cells size, cells size distribution and cells density of the foamed Polystyrene. The presence of the terpene promotes the mass transfer that is mainly governed by the diffusion of the CO 2 into the polymeric rich phase due to the relaxation of the polymer chains. The recycled Polystyrene, obtained following this methodology, presents microcellular structure, non remarkable traces of terpene and any evidence of degradation. Finally, the economic analysis of the process was carried out to determine the feasibility of the recycling process. The traditional high costs involved in the recycling of PS wastes are balanced by the high added value of the recycled polymer, but also due to the mild operating conditions required to carry out the process. The selective dissolution technique eliminates the need to sort previously the polymer from mixed plastic waste streams. The economical benefits, together with the environmental advantages show the interest of the process for the treatment of the large amount of Polystyrene wastes produced daily...|$|R
40|$|Thiokol Propulsion {{has worked}} {{extensively}} to replace 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane (TCA) with ozone depleting chemicals (ODC) -free solvents {{for use in}} the manufacture of the Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) for the Space Shuttle Program. As Thiokol has transitioned from sub-scale to full-scale testing and implementation of these new solvents, issues have been discovered which have required special attention. The original intent of Thiokol's solvent replacement strategy was to replace TCA with a single drop-in solvent for all equivalent applications. We have learned that a single candidate does not exist for replacing TCA. Solvent incompatibility with process materials has caused us to seek for niche solvents and/or processing changes that provide an ODC-free solution for special applications. This paper addresses some of the solvent incompatibilities, which have lead to processes changes and possible niche solvent usage. These incompatibilities were discovered during full-scale testing of ODC-free solvents and relate to vulcanized rubber and bond systems in the RSRM. Specifically, the following items are presented: (1) Cure effects of d-limonene based solvents on Silica Filled Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (SF-EPDM) rubber. During full-scale test operations, Thiokol discovered that d-limonene (<b>terpene)</b> based <b>solvents</b> inhibit the cure of EPDM rubber. Subsequent testing showed the same issue with Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (NBR). Also discussed are efforts to minimize uncured rubber exposure to solvents; and (2) Cured bond system sensitivity to ODC-free solvents. During full scale testing it was discovered that a natural rubber to steel vulcanized bond could degrade after prolonged exposure to ODC-free solvents. Follow on testing showed that low vapor pressure and residence time seemed to be most likely cause for failure...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{technology}} of membrane contactors was assessed for the liquid-liquid extraction of highly valuable oxygenated terpenes from lemon essential oil using mixtures of water and ethanol as solvents (20 - 66 % v/v ethanol). The main expected benefit of using membrane contactors in this application was {{the elimination of the}} phase separation step, which can be difficult in these types of systems, which are characterized by a low interfacial tension and the presence of natural surfactants. A commercially available polypropylene hollow fibre contactor (Liqui-Cel (R) 2. 5 x 8 with X 30 fibres) was used in this study. Stabilizing the interface between the hydro-alcoholic solvent and lemon essential oil in membrane pores proved difficult (breakthrough pressure below 0. 2 bar), even with solvents containing only 20 % v/v ethanol. This problem was probably due to defects in the membrane material such as the presence of large pores (up to 4 mu m in diameter). Nonetheless, the hydro-alcoholic extract remained emulsion free throughout extraction, considered to be an improvement since it eliminated the time-consuming decantation step (process intensification). High mass transfer coefficients up to 1. 08 x 10 (- 6) m/s were obtained for the tracer of oxygenated <b>terpenes</b> and a <b>solvent</b> with 66 % v/v ethanol. The membrane never represented more than 25 % of the total resistance to mass transfer. We demonstrated the high potential of using membrane contactors for this application, provided that improvements were performed on membrane materials.
