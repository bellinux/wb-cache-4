5|$|Much of our {{information}} about the first Marshalsea is about the prison in the early 18th-century, courtesy of three sources. John Baptist Grano (1692 – c. 1748), one of George Frederick Handel's <b>trumpeters</b> at the opera house in London's Haymarket, was jailed there for a debt of £99 (£ today), and kept a detailed diary, A Journal of My Life inside the Marshalsea, of his 458-day incarceration from 30 May 1728 until 23 September 1729. The other two key sources are a 1729 report by a parliamentary committee, led by James Oglethorpe MP, {{on the state of}} the Fleet and the Marshalsea, and the subsequent murder trial that year of William Acton, the Marshalsea's chief jailor.|$|E
5|$|The College found a patroness in Mary I, {{although}} {{it must have}} been embarrassing for both sides, after the heralds initially proclaimed the right of her rival Lady Jane Grey to the throne. When King Edward VI died on 6 July 1553, Lady Jane Grey was proclaimed queen four days later, first in Cheapside then in Fleet Street by two heralds, trumpets blowing before them. However, when popular support swung to Mary's side, the Lord Mayor of London and his councils accompanied by the Garter King of Arms, two other heralds, and four <b>trumpeters</b> returned to Cheapside to proclaim Mary's ascension as rightful queen instead. The College's excuse was that they were compelled in their earlier act by the Duke of Northumberland (Lady Jane's father-in-law, who was later executed), an excuse that Mary accepted.|$|E
5|$|The Crown Jewels include 16 silver {{trumpets}} {{dating from}} between 1780 and 1848.

They have not been used since the Corps of State <b>Trumpeters</b> was disbanded by the Duke of Wellington as a cost-cutting measure in the 19thcentury. The trumpeters' main job was to sound a fanfare at key points in the coronation, and they also played at the banquet afterwards in Westminster Hall.

5|$|The inauguration {{ceremony}} {{was conducted by}} the civic authorities and by the surviving, and still powerful, Guild of StGeorge, and combined elements of a public festival and a religious carnival. Four whifflers (city officials carrying swords) marched ahead of the procession to clear a path. Behind the whifflers, the incoming and outgoing mayors rode side-by-side, preceded by <b>trumpeters</b> and standard-bearers carrying the banners of England and St George, and followed by the city's Sheriffs and Aldermen in ceremonial gowns of violet and red, respectively. The procession was flanked by the city's waits (musicians playing loud wind instruments, usually the shawm) (a mediaeval double reed wind instrument with conical wooden body), and accompanied by dick fools (clowns carrying wands and wearing red and yellow gowns adorned with bells and cats' tails) and a man costumed as a dragon.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{artillery}} officer Anders Gyllenspak, only 40 men, including himself, survived the sinking: Major Johan Klerk, 2 <b>trumpeters,</b> 14 sailors and 22 soldiers, {{which means that}} more than 800 had perished. Among them were half a dozen navy and army officers {{as well as the}} chief physician of the Admiralty and the fleet apothecary. Altogether around 1,400 men died when Kronan and Svärdet were lost, and in the days following the battle, hundreds of corpses were washed up on the east coast of Öland. According to the vicar of Långlöt parish, 183 men were taken from the beaches and buried at Hulterstad and Stenåsa graveyards. Lorentz Creutz's body was identified and shipped to his estate in Savolaks, Finland, where it was buried. The losses were even worse since Kronan was the flagship and was manned with the best sailors and gunners in the fleet. When Kronan and Svärdet went down, they took with them the navy's entire stock of 30- and 36-pounder guns. Altogether over 300tonnes of bronze guns worth nearly 250,000 silver dalers went down with the ships, a sum that was slightly higher than the value of the ships themselves.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the initial}} {{appointments}} to the Order were largely political, from the 1770s appointments to the Order were increasingly made for naval, military or diplomatic achievements. This is {{partly due to}} the conflicts Britain was engaged in over this period. The Peninsular War resulted in so many deserving candidates for the Bath that a statute was issued allowing the appointment of Extra Knights in time of war, who were to be additional to the numerical limits imposed by the statutes, and whose number was not subject to any restrictions. Another statute, this one issued some 80 years earlier, had also added a military note to the Order. Each knight was required, under certain circumstances, to supply and support four men-at-arms for a period not exceeding 42 days in any year, to serve in any part of Great Britain. This company was to be captained by the Great Master, who had to supply four <b>trumpeters,</b> and was also to appoint eight officers for this body, however the statute was never invoked.|$|E

40|$|Two {{species of}} swan are {{regularly}} found in Utah, tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus) and <b>trumpeter</b> swans (Cygnus buccinator). Tundra swans migrate through Utah. During the fall migration period they are hunted {{in the state}} under guidelines established by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). <b>Trumpeter</b> swans are occasional visitors to Utah during the same migration period. Because <b>trumpeter</b> swans are difficult to distinguish from tundra swans in flight, they 11 {{are at risk of}} being harvested during the swan hunt. In my thesis, I examine the factors that may influence <b>trumpeter</b> swan vulnerability to harvest. Specifically, I evaluated height and velocity of foraging flights for both species of swans and identified characteristics of Utah swan hunters. This information could assist the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources in developing an educational program to reduce <b>trumpeter</b> swan vulnerability. I applied flight dynamics theory to 86 <b>trumpeter</b> and 178 tundra swan measurements. Both speed and height of short-range foraging flights were used to predict <b>trumpeter</b> and tundra swan vulnerability. The theory predicted that <b>trumpeter</b> swans fly slower and lower than tundra swans, and thus may be more vulnerable to harvest. The predicted flight height of tundra swans was compared to observations of tundra swans made at the USFWS Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge. Average body area of the two species of swans was compared. <b>Trumpeter</b> swans had, on average, a 30 % larger body area. Combining the lower predicted flight and larger body size, <b>trumpeter</b> swans may be up to 26 % more vulnerable on a 3. 8 -km flight and 15 % more vulnerable on a 10 -km flight than tundra swans on the same flight path. In addition to current regulations, the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources is interested in implementing a swan hunter education course to further reduce the likelihood of a <b>trumpeter</b> swan being harvested during the swan hunt. I surveyed a representative sample of Utah swan hunters to determine if they would participate in the course and attitudes about current regulations, and to identify specific topics that should be emphasized in the course. My survey suggested that Utah swan hunters would be receptive to a swan hunter education course. Based on the responses, any swan hunter education course should emphasize identification of <b>trumpeter</b> and tundra swans, distance estimation, and regulations regarding the swan hunt...|$|R
