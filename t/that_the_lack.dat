5|$|Eurogamer {{noted the}} {{annoyance}} {{of returning to}} defend over 20 towns each with recurring zombie problems, but said that the game mechanic is never too bothersome and even appreciated its element of time management, {{similar to that of}} the Dead Rising game series. IGN thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of fast travel was an impediment. Reviewers also noted technical issues with moving Marston's character, especially when climbing ladders and outrunning zombies.|$|E
5|$|In some {{interpretations of}} the novella, the male {{characters}} represent patriarchal society, with Hyde signifying its moral corruption. Other interpretations suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of female companionship for the male characters indicates their latent homosexuality and that Hyde is engaged in homosexual activity. These interpretations are harder {{to apply to the}} play because of Sullivan's addition of female characters and heterosexual relationships.|$|E
5|$|Local soccer {{fans were}} {{concerned}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> {{of a natural}} grass field would hinder Seattle's chances of receiving an MLS expansion franchise. They asserted that voters had approved the facility {{with the understanding that}} the new stadium was intended for soccer as well as football. In a compromise, First & Goal agreed to pay for grass to be installed for special events when needed.|$|E

HP and Intel brought the next-generation Itanium2 processor to market a year later.|$|E
5|$|Average wage {{rates in}} the Soviet Union were {{published}} relatively rarely. Some academics in the West believed this was because the Soviet government wanted to conceal low average earnings. Alec Nove wrote in 1966 (when wage statistics were published {{for the first time}} since the Second World War) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of transparency surrounding average wages was intended to prevent Soviet workers from discovering the huge disparities that existed between wages in different sectors of the Soviet economy.|$|E
5|$|Following a final {{appearance}} at the 1948 Summer Olympics, art competitions {{were removed from the}} Olympic program. Planners of the 1952 Summer Olympics opposed their inclusion on logistical grounds, claiming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of an international association for the event meant that the entire onus of facilitation was placed on the local organizing committee. Concerns were also raised about the professionalism of the event, since only amateurs were allowed to participate in the sporting tournaments, and the growing commercialization of the competitions, as artists had been permitted to sell their submissions {{during the course of the}} Games since 1928. In 1952 an art festival and exhibition was held concurrent with the Games, a tradition that has been maintained in all subsequent Summer Olympics.|$|E

5|$|Gary Steinman of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of a plotline {{gave the}} player no {{incentive}} to keep playing through what he felt was a poor combat system. Both of those criticisms were repeated by Electronic Gaming Monthlys Sam Kennedy in his review. RPGamer's Bilyk felt that the smaller plots, while sometimes simplistic and not focused on the player, were enjoyable experiences. IGN's Smith concluded that while he enjoyed the game, he {{felt that it was}} not a complete game like Secret of Mana, but instead a collection of fun experiences.|$|E
5|$|I {{think that}} the band went on... maybe not a tangent, {{but we had a}} goal in mind, {{and at the end of}} the {{recording}} process, we were so proud of how artistic we were. And I think we showed too much. I think maybe we were a little too jaded and a little too dark, and I think <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of hope and faith that we put on this record made us a little less sparkly and light to people. But I think that it's all part of our evolution. We all went a bit too far.|$|E
5|$|In Trinsey v. Pennsylvania (1991), the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit {{was faced}} with a {{situation}} where, following the death of Senator H.John HeinzIII of Pennsylvania, Governor Robert P. Casey had provided for a replacement and for a special election that did not include a primary. A voter and prospective candidate, John S. Trinsey,Jr., argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of a primary violated the Seventeenth Amendment and his right to vote under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Third Circuit rejected these arguments, ruling that the Seventeenth Amendment does not require primaries.|$|E

5|$|In {{a letter}} dated 12 June 1842 in the Colonial Secretary's Records, Marshall Clifton, Chief Commissioner of the Western Australian Land Company, {{wrote of the}} need for an {{improved}} Perth–Fremantle–Bunbury road. On a special trip he took in the previous October to look for a new route, two surveyors gave their approval to the proposed coastal route, with a ferry across the estuary. Governor John Hutt approved of the idea of a road, but thought a ferry would be impractical, at least during winter, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of public funds made it impossible. Clifton continued to write letters to the Colonial Secretary advocating the construction of a road.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, a black LGBT organisation, the Out and Proud Diamond Group (OPDG), in {{association}} with the Peter Tatchell Foundation, organised a protest outside Jamaica's London embassy on 28 August. Talking to press, the OPDG's Marvin Kibuuka condemned Jones' murder and called for supporters to actively oppose the persecution of LGBT people in both Jamaica and elsewhere. Peter Tatchell later asserted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of action by Simpson-Miller and the police was tantamount to colluding with those guilty of an anti-LGBT hate crime.|$|E
5|$|On January 12, 2010, Haiti {{was struck}} by a magnitude-7.0 {{earthquake}}, the country's most severe earthquake in over 200 years. The epicenter of the quake was just outside the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince. Over 230,000 civilians have been confirmed dead by the Haitian government because of the disaster and around 300,000 have been injured. Approximately 1.2 million people are homeless and it has been reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of temporary shelter may lead to the outbreak of disease.|$|E

5|$|Southey {{uses the}} poem to {{describe}} various superstitions and myths, {{with a heavy}} reliance on repetition of various themes that link the myths together. Although based in Islamic theology, most of the action is mechanical instead of emphasising possible moral truths that {{can be drawn from}} the plot. Though the main character is purported to be a Muslim, the story actually takes place thousands of years before Islam, in ancient Babylon. Critics gave the work mixed reviews, with some emphasising the strong morality within the work or the quality of the poetry. However, other critics felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of a strong lyrical structure and the use of Middle Eastern myths detracted from the poem.|$|E
5|$|The Bucknill Committee, {{which had}} been set up to {{investigate}} the loss of major warships, also produced a report. This report said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of backup power sources was a major design failure, which contributed to the loss: Ark Royal depended on electricity for much of her operation, and once the boilers and steam-driven dynamos were knocked out, the loss of power made damage control difficult. The committee recommended the design of the bulkheads and boiler intakes be improved to decrease the risk of widespread flooding in boiler rooms and machine spaces, while the uninterrupted boiler room flat was criticised. The design flaws were rectified in the Illustrious- and Implacable-class carriers, under construction at the time.|$|E
5|$|The first Pe-3s {{were issued}} to the 95th High-Speed Bomber Regiment in the Moscow Military District and the Regiment's {{experiences}} with the aircraft revealed other problems. Firing the guns at night dazzled the pilot and destroyed his night vision and the glare from searchlights through the glazing on the lower nose also blinded the pilot. Crews complained bitterly <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of frontal armor made them vulnerable to defensive fire from German bombers. Flash hiders installed on the guns and curtains covering the windows cured the first problems, {{but the lack of}} armor could not be rectified immediately. Many aircraft were also fitted with launchers for four to six RS-82 and RS-132 rockets for ground-attack missions. Another common addition was a launcher for DAG-10 aerial grenades mounted in the tail.|$|E

2500|$|Edge, {{while giving}} the game a {{positive}} score of 7/10, criticized <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of traditional Mario charm, poor graphical detail and overall easiness. GamesRadar, who also scored {{the game of}} 7/10, argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game <b>lacked</b> <b>the</b> creativity {{of others in the}} series. The A.V. Club gave it a negative score of C+, calling it [...] "the least essential Mario title to date", and stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game <b>lacks</b> a strong concept and shows an underlying repetitiveness in Mario games. Nintendo Power argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game works as a sequel because it maintains what made the original Mario games great while adding new features.|$|R
5|$|The {{physiological}} {{function of the}} prion protein remains a controversial matter. While data from in vitro experiments suggest many dissimilar roles, studies on PrP knockout mice have provided only limited information because these animals exhibit only minor abnormalities. In research done in mice, {{it was found that}} the cleavage of PrP proteins in peripheral nerves causes the activation of myelin repair in Schwann cells and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of PrP proteins caused demyelination in those cells.|$|E
5|$|When the Negev forces {{reached the}} coastal road, they {{realized}} {{that they could not}} continue on their vehicles, which could not travel in the sand dunes {{to the west of the}} road. The vehicles were therefore left with a platoon to the south of Isdud to block a possible Egyptian retreat. The other soldiers continued on foot into the sand dunes in an attempt to flank the Egyptian positions. On the second try, the Negev forces successfully captured several key points in the village, and destroyed a cannon. Nahum Sarig, the Negev Brigade commander, later wrote <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of intelligence on the enemy prevented the Israeli force from continuing its assault, while the Egyptians had time to regroup.|$|E
5|$|After 1935, {{the mines}} were reopened {{and there was}} steady growth in the region. According to David M. Gordon, the unrest gave missionaries {{a chance to respond}} to the Watchtower {{movement}} in a coordinated fashion. The London Missionary Society and the Church of Scotland worked together after the strike, saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of education and religious instruction were contributing factors. The missionaries and the mining companies said that a Christian education would create a disciplined workforce, a belief which was called the spiritual wing of industrial capitalism. The region's Protestant mission established the United Mission of Copperbelt (UMCB), which led to the establishment of Protestant bodies such as the Church of Central Africa in Rhodesia (CCAR) in 1945 and the United Church of Central Africa in Rhodesia in 1958 (which became the United Church of Zambia in 1965).|$|E

50|$|In <b>that</b> court case, <b>the</b> {{defendant}} {{had argued}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> court <b>lacked</b> personal jurisdiction over it but refused {{a court order}} to produce evidence of this <b>lack</b> of jurisdiction. <b>The</b> defendant argued <b>that,</b> because <b>the</b> court <b>lacked</b> jurisdiction, <b>the</b> court had no authority to issue an order to show proof of <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of jurisdiction. <b>The</b> Supreme Court rejected that argument and determined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> defendant's refusal to comply waived the right to contest jurisdiction, just as if it had never contested jurisdiction at all.|$|R
2500|$|Dennis Harvey of Variety {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> film <b>lacked</b> {{in comparison}} to the 1972 original in almost every aspect. Harvey felt like the film spent more time trying to please current horror conventions than create an effective update to Craven's film. Harvey criticized the choice of changing a [...] "credibly ordinary family" [...] into [...] "typical modern movie-fantasy clan". He also noted that Dillahunt's portrayal of Krug is no match for David Hess. Michael Rechtshaffen, from The Hollywood Reporter, felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> remake followed close to the original—something fans of the 1972 film would appreciate—but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> film <b>lacked</b> <b>the</b> timing of the Craven's film. Craven was responding to the graphic images being sent back during the Vietnam War and allowed his film [...] "sociological context", while Iliadis's 2009 film comes across as [...] "exploitative". Although Rechtshaffen points out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> parents <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> training and skill of Liam Neeson's character in Taken, the performances from all of the actors are [...] "uniformly sturdy".|$|R
