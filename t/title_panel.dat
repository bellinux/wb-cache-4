50|$|The first Dungeon Masters Screen {{featured}} a cover by Dave Trampier and {{was published by}} TSR in 1979 as two cardboard screens; a second printing {{in the same year}} consisted of two cardstock screens, with an Erol Otus painting of a fighter vs. a dragon on the <b>title</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Expendable parts {{may include}} a topper (a small {{separate}} comic strip, no longer used in mainstream comics), [...] "throwaway" [...] panels (a short throw-away gag, still common), {{or a large}} <b>title</b> <b>panel</b> or tier. Due to the desire to re-arrange, comics may use a conventional layout of the panels (as demonstrated below) {{to allow them to}} be cut up and displayed on a varied number of tiers.|$|E
50|$|Sunday strips are {{in color}} and their <b>title</b> <b>panels</b> are {{sometimes}} a tribute to a famous comic strip, a work of art, or another subject, including Flash #1, Dalí's The Persistence of Memory, Elvis Presley, Trout Mask Replica, and Magritte's Golconda.|$|R

5000|$|In {{an issue}} related to size limitations, Sunday comics are often bound to rigid formats that allow their panels to be rearranged in several {{different}} ways while remaining readable. Such formats usually include throwaway panels at the beginning, which some newspapers will omit for space. As a result, cartoonists have less incentive to put great efforts into these panels. Garfield and Mutts were known during the mid-to-late 80s and 1990s respectively for their throwaways on their Sunday strips, however both strips now run [...] "generic" [...] <b>title</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Quarter {{is used by}} {{comic strip}} {{collectors}} and dealers to describe the format in which a full page is divided horizontally into four equal parts. Quarter pages are small, but often {{have all of the}} panels of a half-page, rearranged into two tiers instead of three. Some quarters drop one panel, some add a <b>title</b> <b>panel</b> {{to the left of the}} two tiers. Some newspapers crowd five or even six quarters into a single page.|$|E
5000|$|A sign on {{the front}} of the booth {{declares}} that [...] "The Doctor is" [...] in or out, depending on which side of the [...] "In/Out" [...] placard is displayed. In A Charlie Brown Christmas, Lucy reverses the placard from displaying its [...] "Out" [...] side to reveal the words [...] "Real In". Another time, on the <b>title</b> <b>panel</b> of a Sunday strip, it showed Lucy chewing gum, and the sign read [...] "The Doctor is Preoccupied." ...|$|E
50|$|On January 22, 2006, Clem {{launched}} his first autobiographical comic series San Antonio Rock City, which centered {{on him and}} his then-girlfriend Victoria after moving to San Antonio, TX from Minnesota. The strip generally followed a four-panel format arranged in a square with using the first for the <b>title</b> <b>panel</b> showing Clem and Victoria, parodying American Gothic. Occasionally, {{there are a few}} six-strip comics. San Antonio Rock City was his main focus for a while until he canceled it due to his split with his girlfriend Victoria. The entire series will be collected in the upcoming book My Stupid Life, Vol. 1 from New Reliable Press.|$|E

50|$|Each Passing Show had {{a unique}} title strip across the top, {{with the words}} The Passing Show, “by” and a {{shamrock}} representing Ireland, all arranged into little scenes, like the letters all playing baseball or football, or forming a bridge, or baby birds in a nest, or captured German soldiers or whatever. Below {{that would be a}} dozen or so little mini-features or cartoons. There were more or less regular features within the page, like one-panel strip The Jedge and Jerry and caricatures highlighting local people and their interests and accomplishments, but the bulk of the page were standalone text and cartoon pieces dealing with nature, corn on the cob, OSU football, city politics, fashion and whatever the hell Ireland felt like drawing that week. The dozen or two little pieces didn’t really interact with one another, and Caswell said the page was designed to be read {{over the course of the}} day, with some people returning to it throughout their reading experience, while others sat there and read the whole thing. Appearing fairly regularly was Ireland himself. Not just as the shamrock-headed caricature in the <b>title</b> <b>panel,</b> but also as a little, fat white-haired guy in a janitor’s outfit; the page was his page, and he saw himself as in charge of its maintenance.|$|E
