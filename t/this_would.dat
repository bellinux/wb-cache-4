5|$|DeKalb Avenue rebuilding, {{including}} {{closure of}} the Myrtle Avenue station. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> increase capacity by 18 tph.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>would</b> give a dive time of 54min at 15m before {{reaching}} the reserve of 50 bar.|$|E
5|$|A {{black hole}} {{could be the}} power source instead of a star in order to {{increase}} the matter-to conversion efficiency. A black hole would also be smaller than a star. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> decrease communication distances that would be important for computer-based societies as those described above.|$|E
2500|$|He {{voted against}} {{extending}} the USA PATRIOT Act’s Wiretap Provision on March 1, 2006. <b>This</b> bill <b>would</b> give the FBI {{the authority to}} conduct [...] "roving wiretaps" [...] and access to business records. Voting against <b>this</b> bill <b>would</b> prolong the debate, keeping the USA PATRIOT Act provisional whereas voting for <b>this</b> bill <b>would</b> extend the USA PATRIOT Act as permanent.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A solitary Plains pumpjack on the Lompoc Oil Field, California. Under {{the terms}} of the Tranquillon Ridge deal, <b>this</b> field <b>would</b> be {{decommissioned}} and all of <b>this</b> land <b>would</b> become protected open space.|$|R
5000|$|Configuration Management Database {{software}} : <b>This</b> tool <b>would</b> {{be required}} to maintain a repository of the environment components and its versions. The data in <b>this</b> tool <b>would</b> also be helpful in incident management and problem management.|$|R
5|$|A {{hyperbaric}} lifeboat or hyperbaric {{rescue unit}} may {{be provided for}} emergency evacuation of saturation divers from a saturation system. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> be used if the platform is at immediate risk due to fire or sinking, and allows the divers under saturation to get clear of the immediate danger. The crew would normally start decompression {{as soon as possible}} after launching.|$|E
5|$|A {{hypothesis}} for {{the high}} metal content in SMR dwarf stars is that material enriched in heavy elements fell into the atmosphere from a protoplanetary disk. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> pollute the star's external layers, resulting in a higher than normal metallicity. The lack of a deep convection zone {{would mean that the}} outer layers would retain higher abundance ratios of these heavy elements.|$|E
5|$|A line {{branching}} {{off of the}} IND Crosstown Line running via Franklin Avenue connecting with the BMT Brighton Line. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> have replaced the BMT Franklin Avenue Line.|$|E
50|$|<b>This</b> game <b>would</b> {{give the}} Giants their first win of the season. <b>This</b> game <b>would</b> also mark {{the only time}} to date that Josh Freeman would start for the Vikings after {{transferring}} from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.|$|R
5000|$|<b>This</b> theory <b>would</b> {{explain how}} several {{different}} integrators could be synthesized {{at the same}} time. In addition, <b>this</b> theory <b>would</b> explain the pattern of repetitive DNA sequences followed by a unique DNA sequence that exists in genes., ...|$|R
50|$|The robot with <b>this</b> program <b>would</b> sweep its radar in a circle, firing off radar pulses, {{and when}} it {{detected}} another robot in <b>this</b> way, <b>would</b> fire a projectile set to explode at the correct distance as estimated by the radar pulse. <b>This</b> particular robot <b>would</b> stand still throughout the entire battle, as it never assigned any number to its movement registers.|$|R
5|$|A {{possible}} way to detect an eruption is studying Silverthrone's geological history since every volcano {{has its own}} pattern of behavior, {{in terms of its}} eruption style, magnitude and frequency, so that its future eruption is expected to be similar to its previous eruptions. But <b>this</b> <b>would</b> likely be abandoned {{in part because of the}} volcano's remoteness.|$|E
5|$|A stereospecific form of (S)-mephedrone {{could be}} {{prepared}} via Friedel–Crafts acylation. The {{first step in}} the synthesis would be to react toluene and (S)-N-trifluoroacetylalanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminium chloride, then deprotect the intermediate with hydrochloric acid-propyl alcohol. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> produce (S)-4-methylcathinone, which could then be methylated to produce mephedrone.|$|E
5|$|According {{to transit}} {{advocate}} Steve Munro, the SSE {{will be built}} to use only automatic train control. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> preclude the operation of T1 subway cars on the extension {{as it would be}} too expensive to convert T1 cars to ATC.|$|E
50|$|<b>This</b> race <b>would</b> be Neil Castles' final race in his NASCAR Cup Series career. It {{would also}} be the last race for Doc Faustina before his retirement. Total {{winnings}} for <b>this</b> race <b>would</b> be $108,140 ($ when adjusted for inflation).|$|R
5000|$|To promote {{inter-agency}} {{collaboration in}} providing electronic Government services, where <b>this</b> collaboration <b>would</b> improve {{the service to}} citizens by integrating related functions, and {{in the use of}} internal electronic Government processes, where <b>this</b> collaboration <b>would</b> improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the processes.|$|R
50|$|Justice Stevens, {{joined by}} Justice Scalia, dissented from the seaward {{boundary}} {{portion of the}} opinion. <b>This</b> opinion <b>would</b> average the angles of the Georgia and South Carolina coast lines and draw the boundary at an azimuth of <b>this</b> boundary <b>would</b> be approximately 123 1/2 degrees.|$|R
5|$|Alternatively dsRNA can be {{supplied}} without genetic engineering. One {{approach is to}} add them to irrigation water. The molecules are absorbed into the plants' vascular system and poison insects feeding on them. Another approach involves spraying dsRNA like a conventional pesticide. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> allow faster adaptation to resistance. Such approaches would require low cost sources of dsRNAs that do not currently exist.|$|E
5|$|Although stem lemuriforms like Djebelemur {{may have}} been {{contemporaneous}} with related toothcombed primates around 50 to 48 mya, the sparse African fossil record suggests toothcomb differentiation occurred around 52 to 40mya according to the French paleoanthropologist Marc Godinot. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> conflict with the molecular clock estimates by evolutionary anthropologist Anne Yoder and others, which predict lemur–lorisoid divergence dating between 61 and 90.8mya.|$|E
5|$|An {{international}} Nightstar sleeper {{train was}} also planned; <b>this</b> <b>would</b> have travelled the same routes as Regional Eurostar, plus the Great Western Main Line to Cardiff.|$|E
5000|$|Problem / Incident {{management}} tools : <b>This</b> tool <b>would</b> be used {{to capture}} the problem / incident data and to manage the life-cycle of the incident / problem.

60|$|It is such scenes as <b>this,</b> I <b>would</b> see near London, on a Sunday evening. It is {{such men}} as <b>this,</b> who <b>would</b> do more {{in one year}} to make people {{properly}} religious, cheerful, and contented, than all the legislation of a century could ever accomplish.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> Vodka <b>would</b> {{fit into}} the mid-priced category.|$|R
5|$|Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote a {{concurrence}} that {{agreed with}} {{the finding that the}} state court's decision was reasonable. However, O'Connor held that there could be cases in which age would be relevant to custody analysis. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> be affirmed by the Court in 2011 in J.D.B. v. North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Before {{custodial}} interrogations, {{police are}} required to give suspects a Miranda warning that informs suspects of their legal rights during interrogation. However, Alvarado was not given a Miranda warning {{at any time during}} questioning. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> form part of the basis for Alvarado's legal defense.|$|E
5|$|Connections {{would be}} made to the BMT Nassau Street Line, the Williamsburg Bridge, and the Manhattan Bridge. The Sixth Avenue Line would also be {{connected}} to the Williamsburg and Manhattan Bridges. The connection between the Nassau Street Line and the Manhattan Bridge south tracks would be eliminated. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> allow for thirty additional trains to operate between Midtown Manhattan and Brooklyn.|$|E
50|$|<b>This</b> theory <b>would</b> also be {{extended}} to humans.|$|R
3000|$|... “The {{classification}} of single substances by various producers is not consistent. Therefore, product classification is not feasible.” No. <b>This</b> argument <b>would</b> be valid for {{classification and labelling}} of all products and would make classification in general impossible. Instead, <b>this</b> argument <b>would</b> plead for a more consistent {{classification of}} ingredients.|$|R
50|$|ADOT {{is also in}} the {{planning}} stages for a bypass around Wickenburg. <b>This</b> bypass <b>would</b> effectively continue SR 74 beyond its current western terminus with US 60 to connect to the planned alignment of future I-11. Whether <b>this</b> bypass <b>would</b> be marked as SR 74 or not is undetermined.|$|R
5|$|Diệm's {{victory was}} seen as a blow to French stature in Vietnam, as the former colonial power had helped to set up Bảo Đại's State of Vietnam in 1949. They {{consistently}} opposed Diệm and his policies, and unsuccessfully tried to impede him. The U.S. media regarded Diệm's victory as a signal that the United States would be the only Western power in South Vietnam. Some felt that <b>this</b> <b>would</b> enable Diệm to rule effectively without French hindrance, while others felt that <b>this</b> <b>would</b> leave too much of a burden on the American government. The French media and diplomatic corps viewed the result as a humiliation. Before the poll, French officials had privately predicted Diệm would dissolve the French High Command and use any victory as justification for scrapping the national reunification elections. The French media viewed the poll as undemocratic and a plot by the Americans to sabotage any prospect of national reunification, but France recognised the Republic of Vietnam soon after.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the winter}} 2014 Sochi Olympics the Russian Federation annexed Crimea. The West responded with {{sanctions}} targeted at Putin's immediate entourage, and Bukovsky expressed {{the hope that}} <b>this</b> <b>would</b> prove {{the end of his}} regime.|$|E
5|$|Former Prime Minister of Jamaica Portia Simpson-Miller has {{expressed}} an intention {{to oversee the}} process required to change Jamaica to a republic by 2012; she originally stated <b>this</b> <b>would</b> be complete by August of that year.

50|$|<b>This</b> {{proposal}} <b>would</b> {{have extended}} the Sheppard East LRT east into Durham Region from the planned eastern terminus at Meadowvale Road. <b>This</b> extension <b>would</b> {{have taken the}} Sheppard East LRT from Meadowvale Road east to cross the Toronto/Durham Region border and continue to an undisclosed location within Durham Region.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are plans}} for an iron ore railway {{belonging}} to Sundance Resources, isolated from existing railways, going from mine(s) around Mbalam to a port at Lolabé. <b>This</b> line <b>would</b> be [...] gauge. <b>This</b> line <b>would</b> also extend a short distance into the Republic of Congo. In September, 2011 a deal was struck with Legend Resources, also of Australia, to share railway and port infrastructure for another iron ore mine. <b>This</b> line <b>would</b> also most likely be [...] gauge, but it might link with the [...] Camrail system.
