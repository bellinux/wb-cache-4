60|$|With that {{he turned}} to go, and walking, bareheaded, {{to the outside of}} the little porch, took leave of her with such a happy mixture of {{unconstrained}} respect and unaffected interest, as no breeding could have taught, no <b>truth</b> mistrusted, <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> a pure <b>and</b> single heart expressed.|$|R
6000|$|So {{with his}} mind {{made up to}} this course he headed for camp. [...] "Click-clack, coward! Click-clack, coward!" [...] His very shoes mocked him. He tried to shut out the sound, but he could not. Had Edward Muldoon, Boy Scout, won over Sparrer Muldoon, street gamin, only to lose in the end? Where the trail led {{close to the end}} of the big beaver dam he stopped {{abruptly}} and a last brief battle was fought between Scout and gamin. When it was over he pushed on with an eagerness he had not felt before, for the Scout had triumphed, and this time he knew that the victory was final. He would tell the whole story from beginning to end <b>and</b> spare himself <b>nothing.</b> [...] "Youse ain't no quitter!" [...] he muttered to himself fiercely. [...] "Youse is goin' ter tell de truth, de whole <b>truth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> de truth." ...|$|R
5000|$|On the one hand, as {{scientists}} we are ethically {{bound to the}} scientific method, in effect promising to tell the truth, the whole <b>truth,</b> <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> — which means that we must include all the doubts, the caveats, the ifs, ands, and buts. On the other hand, we are not just scientists but human beings as well. And like most people we'd {{like to see the}} world a better place, which in this context translates into our working {{to reduce the risk of}} potentially disastrous climatic change. To do that we need to get some broadbased support, to capture the public's imagination. That, of course, entails getting loads of media coverage. So we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have. This 'double ethical bind' we frequently find ourselves in cannot be solved by any formula. Each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest. I hope that means being both. (Quoted in Discover, pp. 45-48, October 1989.

It may discourage junta travelling to distant places to see friends, make friends, interact with peers and enjoy the Conferences and Meetings! It is harmful for Tourism, Airlines and many hotels who serve customers like Gods! It is a social crime to nobble (not noble!) the livelihood of so many people. To the Government, which gave me public funds for so many years to carry out research I am giving back this piece of Work. I am giving back something- if it is made public- that will lessen the income, which would have been otherwise thrived upon through international Tourism!

2500|$|According to the {{redundancy}} {{theory of}} truth, asserting that a statement is true is completely equivalent to asserting the statement itself. [...] For example, making {{the assertion that}} [...] "'Snow is white' is true" [...] is equivalent to asserting [...] "Snow is white". [...] Redundancy theorists infer from this premise that truth is a redundant concept; that is, it is merely a word that is traditionally used in conversation or writing, generally for emphasis, but not a word that actually equates to anything in reality. [...] This theory is commonly attributed to Frank P. Ramsey, who held {{that the use of}} words like fact <b>and</b> <b>truth</b> was <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> a roundabout way of asserting a proposition, and that treating these words as separate problems in isolation from judgment was merely a [...] "linguistic muddle".|$|R

50|$|Now Your Majesty {{must know}} the <b>truth,</b> <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> else <b>but</b> the <b>truth,</b> I am five years abroad, and during this short period I have {{suffered}} {{more than a}} man of forty; I have had vengance, I have had a duel, and lastly I have had enemies: all {{for the sake of}} my country.

I will take a square resolution as soon as I receive Your Majesty's letter; but I swear int he name of my dead father that I will stay no longer in this revengeful country.
