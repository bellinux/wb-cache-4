The final design brings a new look at the solution of folding caravans and trailers, especially in the use of inflatable technology {{for the construction of a}} folding <b>tent</b> <b>liner.</b> The basic parameters are reduced and the shape solution in the travel state is minimalistic with regard to the use of the folding system...|$|E
50|$|As the Cold War progressed {{toward the}} {{eventual}} {{termination of the}} nuclear weapons program in 1989, the Nuclear Weapons Production Complex operated by the U.S. Department of Energy, consisting of many National laboratories and production facilities, was quickly transformed {{into a series of}} radiological decommissioning, decontamination, and remediation projects. These activities ignited a large and continuing demand for supplies and equipment needed to protect human workers from ionizing radiation and prevent the spread of radioactive contamination when dealing with radioactive waste operations. Personal protective equipment and clothing, containment <b>tents,</b> glovebags, drum <b>liners,</b> covers, flexible sleeving and sheeting, all became instrumental in performing this hazardous waste cleanup work.|$|R
