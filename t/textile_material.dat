40|$|Bio-inspired by the {{adhesive}} properties of marine mussels, a novel method {{was developed for}} colouration on various kinds of <b>textile</b> <b>materials.</b> Through {{the introduction of a}} catechol group as an adhesive 'anchor' into commercially available colorants, various <b>textile</b> <b>materials</b> were easily coloured at room temperature via a simple dip-coating procedure. The UV-visible results indicated that the introduction of the catechol group did not obviously change the absorption of the parent colorants. The coloured fabrics were evaluated by colorimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, optical microscopic analysis and colouration fastness tests. Compared to the control colouration, the obtained results showed that this novel method gave <b>textile</b> <b>materials</b> a better colouration, which was verified by the obviously deeper colour appearance and higher K/S values. This colouration method was especially suitable for those <b>textile</b> <b>materials</b> difficult to be coloured by traditional methods, such as polylactic acid and polypropylene.

40|$|This {{study is}} to {{investigate}} the fire safety of <b>textile</b> and clothing <b>materials.</b> It also assesses the flammability for textiles in general. With the increase in big fires, accidental or non-accidental, people are worrying about the fire behaviour of combustibles. The flammability of <b>textile</b> and clothing <b>materials</b> is a great concern. Appropriate tests should be developed to assess <b>textile</b> and clothing <b>materials</b> to ensure they are safe in a fire. In fact, textile products should satisfy some fire safety criteria depending on their uses. There are specified flammability requirements on selected products, though whether these are good enough for assessing modern <b>textile</b> <b>materials</b> should be watched. Typical <b>textile</b> <b>materials</b> with and without fire retardants protection were selected for assessing the fire behaviour with a cone calorimeter. High radiative heat flux up to 70 kWm‒ 2 was applied to assess those selected <b>textile</b> <b>materials.</b> A cone calorimeter is suggested to be the minimum requirement, though some full-scale burning tests are necessary for some purposes.

50|$|Glass cloth is a <b>textile</b> <b>material,</b> {{originally}} developed {{to be used}} in greenhouse paneling, allowing sunlight's ultraviolet rays to be filtered out, while still allowing visible light through to plants.

The original cloth was made from linen, but a large quantity is made with cotton warp and tow weft, and in some cases they are composed entirely of cotton. Thort fibres of the cheaper kind are easily detached from the cloth.|$|E

50|$|Overrun gear {{consisting}} of hook cables and/or elastic nets known as barriers {{are commonly used}} as a backup system. Barrier nets catch the wings and fuselage of an aircraft and use an arresting engine or other methods such as anchor chains or bundles of woven <b>textile</b> <b>material</b> to slow the aircraft down. On some land-based airfields where the overrun area is short, a series of concrete blocks referred to as an engineered materials arrestor system is used. These materials are used to catch the landing gear of an aircraft and slow it via rolling resistance and friction. Aircraft are stopped by the transfer of energy required to crush the blocks.|$|E
