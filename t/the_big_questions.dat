500|$|Resistance to {{the growing}} {{influence}} of molecular biology was especially evident in evolutionary biology. Protein sequencing had great potential for the quantitative study of evolution (through the molecular clock hypothesis), but leading evolutionary biologists questioned the relevance of molecular biology for answering <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>questions</b> of evolutionary causation. Departments and disciplines fractured as organismic biologists asserted their importance and independence: Theodosius Dobzhansky made the famous statement that [...] "nothing in biology makes sense except {{in the light of}} evolution" [...] {{as a response to the}} molecular challenge. The issue became even more critical after 1968; Motoo Kimura's neutral theory of molecular evolution suggested that natural selection was not the ubiquitous cause of evolution, at least at the molecular level, and that molecular evolution might be a fundamentally different process from morphological evolution. (Resolving this [...] "molecular/morphological paradox" [...] has been a central focus of molecular evolution research since the 1960s.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Non-overlapping magisteria: Evolutionary {{biologist}} Stephen Jay Gould {{argues that}} there {{need not be}} conflict between reason and religious belief because they are each authoritative in their own domain (or [...] "magisterium"). For example, perhaps reason alone {{is not enough to}} explain such big questions as the origins of the universe, the origin of life, the origin of consciousness, the foundation of morality, or the destiny of the human race. If so, reason can work on those problems over which it has authority while other sources of knowledge or opinion can have authority on <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>questions.</b>|$|E
