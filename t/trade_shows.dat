5|$|The Corn Exchange, {{situated}} at the junction of Bank Street and Elwick Road, opened on 3 December 1861.

40|$|The <b>trade</b> <b>show</b> {{marketing}} {{literature has}} been growing over the past decades, attracting {{a steady stream of}} research and journal publications. However, this body of research has not been subject to a systematic literature review. Accordingly, {{the purpose of this article}} is to provide a systematic review of the <b>trade</b> <b>show</b> marketing literature with the aim of delineating its current state, trends, gaps and inconsistencies. To this end, multiple electronic databases were searched and 91 <b>trade</b> <b>show</b> articles published in 24 marketing journals were extracted. The extracted articles were carefully analyzed with the help of a comprehensive classification framework focusing on broad thematic, theoretical and methodological dimensions. The findings revealed that: (a) <b>trade</b> <b>show</b> research is marked by inconsistencies that concern core thematic issues, such as <b>trade</b> <b>show</b> participation modes, <b>trade</b> <b>show</b> activity stages and <b>trade</b> <b>show</b> performance; (b) <b>trade</b> <b>show</b> research is atheoretical for the most part, but has become increasingly theory oriented in recent years; and (c) <b>trade</b> <b>show</b> research is heavily dependent on a combination of cross-sectional designs and surveys, with limited application of other designs and data collection approaches. Building on these findings, the review proposes an extensive research agenda to help move the <b>trade</b> <b>show</b> marketing literature forward...|$|R

5|$|Eidos hired several {{models to}} portray Lara Croft at {{publicity}} events, promotions, <b>trade</b> <b>shows,</b> and photo shoots. Nathalie Cook {{was the first}} model, portraying the character from 1996 to 1997. Cook was followed by British actress Rhona Mitra from 1997 to 1998. Eidos then updated the Croft costume to match its video game depiction. Core Design reportedly restricted Mitra's dialogue as the character at <b>trade</b> <b>shows</b> and out of costume. French model Vanessa Demouy succeeded Mitra {{for a brief time}} until fashion model Nell McAndrew took over the role at the 1998 Electronic Entertainment Expo. McAndrew portrayed Croft from 1998 until 1999, when Eidos fired her for posing in Playboy, which used the character and Tomb Raider franchise to promote the McAndrew's issue without Eidos's approval. Core Design was granted an injunction against the magazine to protect the character's image; Playboy was ordered to place stickers {{on the cover of the}} issue to conceal the reference to Tomb Raider. Eidos later donated McAndrew's Tomb Raider costume to a UNICEF charity auction.|$|E
5|$|For {{activities}} {{open to the}} public, such {{as community}} gatherings, school events, or <b>trade</b> <b>shows,</b> a police- or media-issued press pass may offer little advantage.

40|$|<b>Trade</b> <b>show</b> is {{generally}} considered to be an effective marketing tool for products and services, but it also has an important role as information-sharing platform between <b>trade</b> <b>show</b> participants. This study examines what kind of value <b>trade</b> <b>show</b> information has for the companies attending a B 2 B <b>trade</b> <b>show.</b> In this study, the value of <b>trade</b> <b>show</b> information was measured by using the Return On <b>Trade</b> <b>Show</b> Information – model (RTSI) developed by Bettis-Outland, Cromartie, Johnston and Borders (2010). Using this framework, it was studied how information acquistion, dissemination and use, as well as quality of information impact on the tangible and intangible outcomes of <b>trade</b> <b>show</b> participation. In addition, the RTSI model was developed further and objective setting for information was included in the model. Quantitative methods were used to carry out the research. The data for this study was collected through an online questionnaire targeted to both exhibitors and visitors of a B 2 B <b>trade</b> <b>show.</b> The survey was sent out to 3550 <b>trade</b> <b>show</b> attendees of which 450 completed the questionnaire resulting a total response rate of 12, 9 %. Two multiple regression models were used to analyze the data. The findings of this study show that information acquisition, dissemination and use have all significant impact on information value. These findings are in line with previous research on RTSI. In addition, this study has been able to demonstrate that quality of information has positive relationship with information value. Also, the objective setting was found to have significant impact on tangible and intangible outcomes of <b>trade</b> <b>show</b> participation...|$|R

5|$|In 1973, DEC {{commissioned}} {{the creation of}} a real-time, graphical version of Lunar Lander, which was intended to showcase the capabilities of their new DEC GT40 graphics terminals, when connected to their PDP-10 or PDP-11 minicomputers. The game was written by Jack Burness, a DEC consultant, and named Moonlander; it was distributed with DEC computers and displayed at <b>trade</b> <b>shows.</b> Unlike the previous turn-based, textual games, Moonlander is a real-time graphical game. The goal remains to correctly land a lunar module {{on the surface of the}} moon using the game's telemetry data. If the player miscalculates the module's landing, the module will either fly off into space or crash into the moon's surface. The game is controlled with a light pen, and the output display was a vector graphics system; the light pen allowed adjusting the throttle value and the angle of the lunar lander. Burness has said that he does not recall playing the original Lunar, but that by 1973 there were numerous versions of the game which he had played. He based the calculations of the fuel consumption for maneuvering the rocket on the actual lunar lander specifications, which he obtained from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which co-designed the lander. The entire game was written in ten days.|$|E
