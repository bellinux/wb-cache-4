A CT of the {{adrenal glands}} can be used <b>to</b> <b>check</b> for structural abnormalities of the adrenal glands. An MRI of the pituitary can be used <b>to</b> <b>check</b> for structural abnormalities of the pituitary. However, in order <b>to</b> <b>check</b> the functionality of the Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal (HPA) Axis the entire axis must be tested by way of ACTH stimulation test, CRH stimulation test and perhaps an Insulin Tolerance Test (ITT).
