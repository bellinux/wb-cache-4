500|$|On September 28, 2015, {{the show}} debuted {{a new set}} {{alongside}} the debut of Trevor Noah's tenure. According to Larry Hartman, Noah {{took a lot of}} inspiration from Stewart's set. A second on-stage 'jumbo-tron' was added and the colours of the set were made lighter. The graphics, intro, theme music, lower thirds, logo, etc. were also all revamped. On July 19, 2016, the set and graphics were given another change to reflect Democalypse 2016 and denote The Daily Shows RNC and DNC coverage (which was taped in the conventions' respective cities). The new temporary sets had a Washington theme, and was meant to show <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>is</b> [...] "a little broke" [...] and needs [...] "repair". Though the studio was reverted to its former self after the election week in 2016, the changes to the graphics were kept.|$|E
2500|$|Donald Trump's {{campaign}} drew {{heavily on}} his personal image, enhanced by his previous media exposure. The primary slogan of the Trump campaign, extensively used on campaign merchandise, was Make America Great Again. The red baseball cap with the slogan emblazoned on the front {{became a symbol of}} the campaign, and has been frequently donned by Trump and his supporters. Trump's right-wing populist positions—reported by The New Yorker to be nativist, protectionist, and semi-isolationist—differ in many ways from traditional conservatism. He opposed many free trade deals and military interventionist policies that conservatives generally support, and opposed cuts in Medicare and Social Security benefits. Moreover, he has insisted <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>is</b> [...] "broken" [...] and can only be fixed by an outsider.|$|E
60|$|I am {{grateful}} for your offer of 100,000 men, but as at present advised I do not consider <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>is</b> in danger, or {{that there is any}} emergency requiring 60 or 90 days men.|$|E
500|$|At the time, Deism was a {{theological}} outlook, not an organized denomination. It was compatible with being an Episcopalian. Historian Gregg Frazer argues <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>was</b> not a deist but a [...] "theistic rationalist." [...] This theological position rejected core beliefs of Christianity, {{such as the}} divinity of Christ, the Trinity, and original sin. Unlike the deists, the theological rationalists believed in the efficacy of prayer to God. Theologian Peter A. Lillback argues <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>was</b> neither a deist nor a [...] "theistic rationalist" [...] but a Christian who accepted the core beliefs of Christianity.|$|R
60|$|It has <b>been</b> remarked <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>was</b> {{especially}} devout on this occasion--kneeling, {{while others}} stood up. In this, however, each, no doubt, observed the attitude in prayer {{to which he}} <b>was</b> accustomed. <b>Washington</b> knelt, being an Episcopalian.|$|R
50|$|In October 2016, it <b>was</b> learned <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>was</b> {{a finalist}} for the Atlanta Braves {{managerial}} vacancy. The Braves opted to promote interim manager Brian Snitker instead, and then announced the hiring of Washington as their new third base coach, replacing Bo Porter.|$|R
60|$|To THE EDITOR OP' THE SUN:--SIR,--The {{newspaper}} {{atmosphere is}} charged with objections to New York {{as a place of}} sepulchre for General Grant, and the objectors are strenuous <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>is</b> the right place. They offer good reasons--good temporary reasons--for both of these positions.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am not so}} sure of that. We {{have had}} a pretty {{difficult}} task, that of carrying on a government in a new country, which is nevertheless more populous than almost any old country. The influxions are so rapid, that every ten years {{the nature of the}} people is changed. It isn't easy; and though I think on the whole we've done pretty well, I am not going to boast <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>is</b> as yet the seat of a political Paradise." ...|$|E
5000|$|On 18 November 2008, Zarif claimed <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>is</b> {{conspiring to}} foment discord among Iranians {{in order to}} topple the Tehran government. He went on to say: [...] "The concept of a velvet {{revolution}} in Iran {{should not be considered}} as groundless fear." ...|$|E
500|$|News of de Barras' sailing reached New York on August 28, where Graves, Clinton, and Hood {{were meeting}} to discuss the {{possibility}} of making {{an attack on the}} French fleet in Newport, since the French army was no longer there to defend it. [...] Clinton had still not realized <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>was</b> marching south, something he did not have confirmed until September 2. [...] When they learned of de Barras' departure they immediately concluded that de Grasse must be headed for the Chesapeake (but still did not know of his strength). [...] Graves sailed from New York on August 31 with 19 ships of the line; [...] Clinton wrote Cornwallis to warn him <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>was</b> coming, and <b>that</b> he would send 4,000 reinforcements.|$|R
50|$|In late 2006, the US State Department said Ethiopia {{was trying}} to stem the flow of outside arms {{shipments}} to the Islamists in Somalia. Ms. Hironimus added <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>was</b> concerned about reports that the Islamists were using child soldiers and abusing Ethiopian prisoners of war.|$|R
50|$|On February 23, 2015, it <b>was</b> {{announced}} <b>that</b> Ron <b>Washington</b> <b>was</b> named volunteer assistant.|$|R
5000|$|... ♦Washington D.C. - The narrator often {{analyzes}} {{the history and}} character of Washington D.C. throughout the novel. At one point, the narrator remarks <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>is</b> “the perfect city for grief: like walking through a cemetery” (66). In many ways, he has a more intimate relationship with the city than he does with individuals.|$|E
5000|$|Another of {{the popular}} origin {{theories}} is <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>is</b> in fact derived from the Old English verb wascan and the noun dūn meaning [...] "hill"; thus making the name Wascandūn, meaning [...] "washing hill". This theory likely originates from {{the proximity of the}} river Wear to the actual Anglo-Saxon hall at the time (most likely where Washington Old Hall stands today).|$|E
5000|$|Trump's right-wing populist positions—nativist, protectionist, and semi-isolationist—differ in {{many ways}} from {{traditional}} conservatism. He opposes many free trade deals and military interventionist policies that conservatives generally support, and opposes cuts in Medicare and Social Security benefits. While insisting <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>is</b> [...] "broken" [...] and can only be fixed by an outsider, Washington-based conservatives were surprised by the popular support for his positions.|$|E
50|$|The exalted esteem {{in which}} the {{founding}} fathers, and especially George <b>Washington,</b> <b>were</b> held by 19th-century Americans may seem quaintly exaggerated to their 21st-century counterparts, but <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>was</b> so regarded is undisputed. The acme of this esteem {{can be seen on}} the ceiling of the United States Capitol Building in the form of Brumidi's fresco The Apotheosis of Washington.|$|R

5000|$|... == United States {{statements}} == In {{the lead}} up to the declaration, United States intelligence officials announced <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>was</b> worried about an economic and political crisis in Venezuela, predicting that Maduro would not complete his presidency. The officials added: [...] "You can hear the ice cracking. You know there's a crisis coming." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{origins of}} the name Washington are not fully known. The most {{supported}} theory (especially amongst local historians) is <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>is</b> derived from Anglo-Saxon Hwæsingatūn, which roughly means [...] "estate of the descendents (family) of Hwæsa". Hwæsa (usually rendered Wassa or Wossa in modern English) is an Old English name meaning [...] "wheat sheaf", the Swedish House of Vasa being a more famous cognate.|$|E
50|$|Eugene first {{appears at}} Hershel's farm, {{which is now}} {{occupied}} by the remaining prison survivors. Eugene claims to know what has caused the plague, but will not disclose any information with the remaining survivors, including Abraham and Rosita. He says he will only share information with officials in Washington, D.C. His lie, along with a belief <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>is</b> the only safezone, prompts {{the rest of the}} survivors to head there in hopes of long-term survival.|$|E
50|$|Vatanka {{has been}} a proponent of {{dialogue}} between the US and states in the Caucasus and Central Asia, arguing <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>is</b> better placed to shape domestic and foreign policies of those countries by remaining actively engaged with states such as Azerbaijan, Georgia and Kazakhstan. In 2015, he visited Kazakhstan as an election observer. That election was condemned as unfair by some in the United States and Vatanka was criticized for his {{decision to go to}} the country.|$|E

60|$|All {{that day}} and the next was the party kept at Venango by the stratagems of Joncaire and his emissaries to detain and seduce the sachems. It was not until 12 o'clock on the 7th of December, <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>was</b> able to extricate {{them out of their}} {{clutches}} and commence his journey.|$|R
5|$|In 2011, Manfred Berg speculated <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> {{probably}} murdered Fryer, but {{doubted that}} he raped her. The same year, Julie Armstrong of the University of South Florida argued <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>was</b> possibly innocent of both charges. Bernstein notes that Washington's motives {{have never been}} established. She also states that his confession could have been coerced, and that the murder weapon—perhaps the strongest evidence against him—could have been planted by authorities.|$|R
50|$|Bar Ilan's Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies {{conducted}} a study in November 2014 which showed that 96% of the Israeli public feels that the country's relations with the United States are important or very important. It was also felt <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>is</b> a loyal ally and that America will come to Israel's aid against existential threats. On the other hand, only 37% believe that President Obama has a positive attitude towards Israel (with 24% saying that his attitude is neutral).|$|E
50|$|Washington tells Hamilton that Jefferson has {{resigned}} {{from his position}} in order to run for president, and that Washington himself is stepping down. Hamilton is shocked, but Washington convinces him {{that it is the}} right thing to do, and they write a farewell address ("One Last Time"). In England, King George III receives word <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>is</b> stepping down and will be replaced with John Adams. The king exits merrily, ready to enjoy the United States' suffering through the political turmoil caused by transitions in leadership, and Adams' inexperience ("I Know Him").|$|E
50|$|Washington {{was founded}} in 1786 by Arthur Fox, a Revolutionary War soldier from Virginia, and William Wood, a Baptist preacher, also from Virginia. The first {{trustees}} included Daniel Boone. The land on which it was laid out was purchased by Fox and Wood from Simon Kenton, the original explorer and settler of the area who at that time lived close by. The town was founded as Washington, Virginia since in 1786 Kentucky did not yet exist as a separate state. It is believed <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>is</b> the first settlement named for George Washington.|$|E
500|$|Howe's {{report to}} London {{implied that the}} fire was {{deliberately}} set: [...] "a most horrid attempt was made {{by a number of}} wretches to burn the town." [...] Royal Governor William Tryon suspected <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>was</b> responsible, writing <b>that</b> [...] "many circumstances lead to conjecture <b>that</b> Mr. <b>Washington</b> <b>was</b> privy to this villainous act" [...] and that [...] "some officers of his army were found concealed in the city." [...] Many Americans also assumed that the fire was the work of Patriot arsonists. John Joseph Henry recorded accounts of marines returning to the Pearl after fighting the fire in which men were [...] "caught in the act of firing the houses." ...|$|R
50|$|Other Gano {{artifacts}} {{in the chapel}} include a painting depicting Gano leading the troops in a prayer of Thanksgiving in 1783 {{at the conclusion of}} the Revolutionary war and a sword <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>was</b> said to have given Gano (which in turn had <b>been</b> given to <b>Washington</b> by Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette).|$|R
5000|$|... Having {{condemned}} the military takeover of Abyei on 21 March, on 22 July, Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice accused the Sudanese military of perpetrating {{human rights violations}} in South Kordofan. Princeton Lyman, the US special envoy to Sudan, said on 10 August <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>was</b> concerned <b>that</b> fighting could spread to and involve newly independent South Sudan.|$|R
5000|$|Chávez's {{campaign}} manager Rafael Lacava {{said that the}} campaign was {{to be based on}} defending Venezuela's national sovereignty and promoting world peace. According to Unión Radio, Lacava added that a campaign theme was to be the [...] "country's freedom to no longer be a North American colony". According to the Associated Press, Chávez launched his campaign [...] "with warnings <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>is</b> trying to undermine December's presidential vote and destabilize Venezuela", saying [...] "I am the candidate of the revolution and without a doubt I am the candidate of the national majority", dismissing other candidates as [...] "tools of the U.S. government". El Universal reports that Chávez said, [...] "In this electoral process there are two candidates only, namely Hugo Chávez and George W. Bush".|$|E
5000|$|Today on Wall Street, {{people who}} have been out of work for nearly two years rallied to ask: where's the {{recovery}} for the Middle Class? Today, I attended a rally of professional Americans who have been displaced by corporate greed and out-of-touch politicians; a passionate crowd of 99ers rallied at the Federal Hall, here in New York, in the shadow of Wall Street. They had one basic question: Where are the jobs? I'd like to tell these people <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>is</b> listening, {{but the reality is that}} members of Congress are back home trying to save their own jobs. You can see the passion in the eyes of the 99ers today. They just want a chance to work. That's it. Ed Schultz, MSNBC's The Ed Show - Video.|$|E

50|$|Strasburg has {{experienced}} rapid growth along its northern corridor {{due to the}} fact <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> D.C. <b>is</b> approximately 80 miles away.|$|R
50|$|In August 2016, it <b>was</b> {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> would <b>be</b> {{producing a}} new ABC television show, Patrol, about female LAPD police officers.|$|R
50|$|A friend stated <b>that</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>was</b> a good {{football}} player, {{but never}} participated {{as a member}} of school sports team due to his poor grades. He transferred between schools repeatedly due to expulsion, and attended Locke High School, John C. Fremont High School, an alternative school attached to Washington Preparatory High School, and Fairfax High School in the Fairfax District near West Hollywood.|$|R
