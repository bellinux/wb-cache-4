5|$|During the 1740s, {{a form of}} the {{crucible}} steel process was discovered that allowed the manufacture of {{a better quality of}} steel than had previously been possible. In about the same period, a technique was developed for fusing a <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> of silver onto a copper ingot to produce silver plating, which became widely known as Sheffield plate. These innovations spurred Sheffield's growth as an industrial town, but the loss of some important export markets led to a recession in the late 18th and early 19thcentury. The resulting poor conditions culminated in a cholera epidemic that killed 402people in 1832. The population of the town grew rapidly throughout the 19thcentury; increasing from 60,095 in 1801 to 451,195 by 1901. The town was incorporated as a borough in 1842 and was granted a city charter in 1893. The influx of people also led to demand for better water supplies, and a number of new reservoirs were constructed {{on the outskirts of the}} town.|$|E
5|$|In the 1740s Benjamin Huntsman, a clock {{maker in}} Handsworth, invented {{a form of}} the {{crucible}} steel process for making {{a better quality of}} steel than had previously been available. At around the same time Thomas Boulsover invented a technique for fusing a <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> of silver onto a copper ingot producing a form of silver plating that became known as Sheffield plate. Originally hand-rolled Old Sheffield Plate was used for making silver buttons. Then in 1751 Joseph Hancock, previously apprenticed to Boulsover's friend Thomas Mitchell, first used it to make kitchen and tableware. This prospered and in 1762–65 Hancock built the water-powered Old Park Silver Mills at the confluence of the Loxley and the Don, one of the earliest factories solely producing an industrial semi-manufacture. Eventually Old Sheffield Plate was supplanted by cheaper electroplate in the 1840s. In 1773 Sheffield was given a silver assay office. In the late 18th century, Britannia metal, a pewter-based alloy similar in appearance to silver, was invented in the town.|$|E
5|$|Triton's {{surface is}} covered with a {{transparent}} layer of annealed frozen nitrogen. Only 40% of Triton's surface has been observed and studied, but it is possible that it is entirely covered in such a <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> of nitrogen ice. Like Pluto's, Triton's crust consists of 55% nitrogen ice with other ices mixed in. Water ice comprises 15–35% and frozen carbon dioxide (dry ice) the remaining 10–20%. Trace ices include 0.1% methane and 0.05% carbon monoxide. There could also be ammonia ice on the surface, as there are indications of ammonia dihydrate in the lithosphere. Triton's mean density implies that it probably consists of about 30–45% water ice (including relatively small amounts of volatile ices), with the remainder being rocky material. Triton's surface area is 23millionkm2, which is 4.5% of Earth, or 15.5% of Earth's land area. Triton has a considerably and unusually high albedo, reflecting 60–95% of the sunlight that reaches it, and it has changed slightly since the first observations. By comparison, the Moon reflects only 11%. Triton's reddish colour is thought {{to be the result of}} methane ice, which is converted to tholins under exposure to ultraviolet radiation.|$|E

40|$|Curved <b>thin</b> <b>sheets</b> are ubiquitously {{found in}} nature and manmade structures. Within the {{framework}} of classical thin plate theory, the stiffness of <b>thin</b> <b>sheets</b> is independent of its bending state. This assumption, however, goes against intuition. Simple experiments with a cantilever sheet made of paper show that the cantilever stiffness largely increases with the transversal curvature. We here demonstrate by using simple geometric arguments that <b>thin</b> <b>sheets</b> subject to two-dimensional bending necessarily develop internal stresses. The coupling between the internal stresses and the bending moments can increase the stiffness of the plate by several times. We develop a theory that describes the stiffness of curved <b>thin</b> <b>sheets</b> with simple equations {{in terms of the}} longitudinal and transversal curvatures. The theory perfectly fits experimental results with a macroscopic cantilever sheet as well as numerical simulations by the finite element method. The results shed new light on plant and insect wing biomechanics and provide an easy route to engineer micro- and nanomechanical structures based on ultrathin materials with extraordinary stiffness tunability...|$|R

The structural elements were hollow beams of square cross section made from folded and quite <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> aluminum, as a consequence subject to destruction if stepped upon. A more substantial folded aluminum base plate was used to form the foundation of most constructions, and additional circular plates could be used to construct larger wheels or pivots. Pulleys, gussets, and splices were also included. The deluxe kits included an electric AC motor with a worm drive and reduction gearset that was powered from household power. While innovative, the lack of general purpose beam members with lots of holes limited the adaptability of the set to complex constructions. Finished assemblies also lacked the robust durability of its principal competition at the time, the Erector Set.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s Simpson Simpson and A. J. Tuzzolino {{developed}} the dust flux monitor instrument which involved a <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> of plastic which was polymerized {{in the presence}} of a strong electric field perpendicular to the plane of the plastic, and then electrically polarized carrying a positive electric charge on one of its surfaces and a negative charge on the other. The way it operated was such that a dust particle or heavy nucleus penetrating through the sheet first vaporizes in a small area releasing the charges, then the electrical signal indicates the location and size of the hole in the plastic which is then calibrated to give information on its speed and size. These calibrations took place from 1985 until 1989. Simpson's device was used on spacecraft Vega 1 and Vega 2 to Halley's comet in 1986, and earned him the Gagarin Medal for Space Exploration that year for his contribution towards the success of the Vega mission, as his instruments had been the only ones from the United States to encounter the comet.|$|E

The overall tensile performance of the joint is discussed together with the weld metal strength overmatching. The ten-sile tests results indicate that in case of transversally loaded joints, the po-sitive difference in yield strength between the weld metal and the base materials (overmatching welds) may reduce the weight of the structure, without diminishing its strength...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{load bearing}} steel deck {{is used in}} {{insulated}} metal deck roofing system for industrial buildings with low-pitched roof areas. The steel sheeting sections are manufactured with cold forming from thin steel strip and {{are attached to the}} underlying purlins or more commonly straight to the steel trusses by self-drilling or self-tapping screws. The behavior of sheeting connections is important in fire especially when the sheeting is in catenary action and tensile forces are devel-oped at supports where the screw connectors are located. A 3 D finite element model is created using ABAQUS software to simulate the single lap screw connections connecting <b>thinner</b> <b>sheet</b> (0. 8 mm) to thicker sheet (10 mm) under static shear at both room and high temperatures. This model considers the material nonlinearity, large deformation and contact behav-ior. The connection model is analyzed through the elastic and plastic ranges up to failure. The analysis reveals that the failure modes of the connection for both room and elevated temperatures are bearing failure of the <b>thinner</b> <b>sheet.</b> The load bearing capacity of the connections depends on the friction between the washer and the <b>thinner</b> <b>sheet,</b> the direct bearing of the screw shank against the <b>thinner</b> <b>sheet</b> and the postbuckling resistance of <b>thinner</b> <b>sheet.</b> Degradation of material at ele-vated temperature further reduces the strength and stiffness of the connections. This connection model can be taken as a component model in the analysis of the behavior of steel sheeting system in fire, which is highly non-linear so as to save the computing time...|$|R
