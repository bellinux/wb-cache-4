50|$|After Dermott's death, the two Grand Lodges {{moved slowly}} towards union. The need for unity was {{underlined}} during the Napoleonic wars, when {{the leaders of}} <b>the</b> Ancients, <b>Moderns,</b> and <b>the</b> Grand Lodge of Scotland acted together to prevent their lodges becoming proscribed organisations. However, the actual process of unification did not start until 1811, when <b>the</b> <b>Moderns</b> started <b>the</b> administrative process of returning their ritual to a form acceptable to the other British Grand Lodges. The final union was {{in the hands of}} two sons of the King, the Duke of Sussex, the Grand Master of <b>the</b> <b>Moderns,</b> and <b>the</b> Duke of Kent. Kent had already effected a union in Canada by simply abolishing <b>the</b> <b>Moderns,</b> and merging their lodges with those of the Ancients. The new Grand Lodge, the United Grand Lodge of England, retained the infrastructure of <b>the</b> <b>Moderns,</b> and <b>the</b> ritual of the Ancients.|$|R

Although Dunckerley belonged to <b>the</b> <b>Moderns</b> Grand Lodge, he leaned towards the Antients in ritual, {{making him a}} natural ambassador for Royal Arch Masonry in his own Grand Lodge.

During Vermeer’s time, Dutch lead was mined from deposits located in the Low Countries; however, by the 19th century, most lead was imported from Australia and the Americas, and differed from the white lead that Vermeer would have used both in the isotope composition of the lead and in the content of trace elements found in the ores. Dutch white lead was extracted from ores containing high levels of trace elements of silver and antimony, while <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> white lead used by Van Meegeren contained neither silver nor antimony, as those elements are separated from the lead during <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> smelting process.|$|E
