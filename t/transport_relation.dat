40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{coupling}} within a porous medium submitted to an electric field. The liquid phase <b>transport</b> <b>relation</b> is written for a saturated porous medium in isothermal conditions, assuming {{that there is no}} strain of the porous matrix. An experimental study is performed in order to validate this <b>transport</b> <b>relation</b> in an organic porous medium: agar gel. This material is chosen for its biphasic structure and for its elastic behaviour that permits to envisage later studies on the couplings between liquid flow, electric effect and strain. In the first place, we determine the (intrinsic) coefficients that appear in the <b>transport</b> <b>relation.</b> For this, we perform hydraulic conduction and electro-osmosis tests. In the second place, hydraulic and electric effects are applied simultaneously and we verify the good superposition, what allows the validation of the <b>transport</b> <b>relation</b> in the case of agar gel...|$|E

40|$|Rivers with poorly-sorted bed {{sediment}} {{create their}} own stratigraphy as they deposit sediment. Prediction of the subsequent river degradation into its own deposit requires knowledge of the spatial structure of the grain size variation of the deposit. The ultimate goal of the present work is the development, testing and verification against experimental data of a numerical model of morphodynamics that can store stratigraphy into memory as it is created by aggradation, and can subsequently consume this stratigraphy {{if and when the}} river later degrades into the deposit. Such a morphodynamic model is tested using a surface-based bedload <b>transport</b> <b>relation</b> known to be applicable to the experiments considered here. Part 1 of a two-part paper addressing this issue describes the laboratory experiments and uses the experimental results performed at mobile-bed equilibrium to evaluate a bedload <b>transport</b> <b>relation.</b> In the companion paper, this bedload <b>transport</b> <b>relation</b> is installed into a morphodynamic model that specifically includes the creation/consumption of stratigraphy.

40|$|The {{delimitation}} of {{the urban}} hinterlands {{of the most important}} settlement centres in the Czech Republic, based on transportation flows, is presented in this paper. Transport flows are a very good indicator of complex spatial relations. Therefore, one can hypothesize that the delimited transport hinterlands are strongly associated with other types of urban hinterlands (e. g. commuting hinterlands). Transport regions of the Czech regional capitals are defined in the empirical section of this paper. These transport regions, supra-nodal territorial units of the Czech transport system, identify the main <b>transport</b> <b>relations</b> within the Czech road network and define the hinterlands of the main settlement centres.

40|$|We derive {{explicit}} {{local transport}} {{relations for the}} global gyrokinetic formalism at arbitrary wavelength. This {{is an extension of}} the analysis in Scott et. al. 2010 where this was examined in the long-wavelength limit. Deriving a local expression for the fluxes requires that the gyroaveraging operator is symmetric, so that if point B is on the gyroring around A, point A is on the gyroring around B, for the same value of the magnetic moment. An algorithm for constructing a symmetric gyroring in a global code is described. Finally, using a simple 2 D gyrokinetic code, we demonstrate the application of the momentum <b>transport</b> <b>relation</b> in a model problem with the full gyroaveraging operator without any long-wavelength approximation...|$|E

A functional relation has been posed for computing the rather peculiar relation between average applied stress and average porosity. Using that relation an attack has been mounted on the dilemma that exists between dynamic and constitutive use of the pressure variable; that is relating dynamic pressure, thermodynamic pressure, stress deviator and higher stress invariants. The resolution was as a linear superposition with a one-way feedback, in that while the dynamic component could not effect the constituitive component, the converse was not true since density appears in the momentum <b>transport</b> <b>relation...</b>|$|E

40|$|Enclosed {{bodies of}} water such as lakes or {{harbours}} often experience large-scale oscillatory motions (seiching). As a simple model of such flow, we investigate exact solutions to the shallow-water equations which represent oscillatory flow in an elliptical basin with parabolic cross section. Specifically, we consider two fundamental modes of oscillation, in one of which the flow {{is parallel to the}} axis of the ellipse, while in the other it is radial. We obtain periodic analytical solutions for sediment transport, including erosion, deposition and advection, under either mode of oscillation, and present a method for obtaining such solutions for a more general class of flow fields and sediment transport models. Our solutions provide estimates of the morphodynamical importance of seiching motions and also reveal a characteristic pattern of net erosion and deposition associated with each mode. In particular, we find that a net flux of suspended sediment can be transported from the deeper to the shallower regions of the basin. These transport patterns, which are driven essentially by settling lag, are highly robust to the formulation of the sediment <b>transport</b> <b>relation</b> and appear not to be substantially affected by the omission of frictional terms in the hydrodynamics: they should thus provide considerable insight into sediment transport in less-idealised system...|$|E
40|$|This study {{advocates a}} {{mathematical}} framework of ''transport relations'' on a network. They single out {{a subset of}} ''traffic states'' described by time, duration, position and other traffic attributes (called ''monads'' for short). Duration evolutions are non-negative, decreasing toward zero for incoming durations, increasing from zero for outgoing durations, allowing the detection of ''junction states'' defined as traffic states with ''zero duration''. A ''junction relation'' (crossroads, synapses, clearing houses, etc.) Is {{a subset of the}} <b>transport</b> <b>relation</b> made of junction states? The objective is to construct a ''transport regulator'' associating with traffic states a set of ''celerities'' that mobiles circulating in the network can use as velocities. In other word, a network is regarded as a ''provider of velocity information'' to the mobiles for travelling from one departure state to an arrival state across a junction relation (a kind of geodesic problem). This investigation assumes that a system governs the evolution of monads in function of time, duration and position using celerities as controls and provides the transport regulator, a feedback from transport states to celerities. The proposed mathematical framework can acclimate road or aerial networks, endocrine (hormonal) or synaptic (neurotransmitters) networks, financial or economic networks, which motivated this investigation. This framework could probably accommodate computer and even social networks. This investigation is restricted to junctions between two routes. Comment: 26 page...|$|E
40|$|Transports sustain {{directly}} {{the economic}} relationship between countries and evolve according to connection between supply and demand. They bring a continuous and direct effort to valorification {{of our planet}} resources, contributing to redistribution of incomes and to world economic and social progress. The paper proposes to place transport activity from logistic point of view, through presentation {{of the relation between}} logistical system and development of transports, and of a relation with economic impact at European level. They are taken into consideration both microeconomic and macroeconomic level. The role of freight transports is presented and analyzed in interdependence with logistic activities from logistic system and with other indicators. The analyze starts from analytical relation of logistic system-freight transport, in endorsement of the idea of dragging an urgent attention to transports field. The results are sustained by presenting some indicators with economic impact at Romanian and European Union level. A highlighted relation is also that between freight transport and gross domestic product. In the final part of the paper there are presented the main results of the analyze and suggestions for development of transports. The competitiveness of enterprises and the comparative advantages of regions depend on information transmission and processing, mobility of people and movement of freight. In consequence, transports can be regarded as carriers of new systems of industrial and spatial organization. freight transport, logistical system, logistical system - <b>transport</b> <b>relation,</b> economic growth, statistical indicators of transports...|$|E
