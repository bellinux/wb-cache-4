25|$|Military {{strategy}} in the Polish–Soviet War influenced Charles de Gaulle, then an instructor with the Polish Army who fought {{in several of the}} battles. He and Władysław Sikorski were the only military officers who, based on their experiences of this war, correctly predicted how the next one would be fought. Although they failed in the interbellum to convince their respective militaries to heed <b>those</b> <b>lessons,</b> early in World War II they rose to command of their armed forces in exile. The Polish–Soviet War also influenced Polish military doctrine, which for the next 20 years would place emphasis on the mobility of elite cavalry units.|$|E

Before leaving, he found a number of pupils for Jules; the modest earnings from <b>those</b> <b>lessons,</b> supplemented by fees earned by both brothers as members of synagogue choirs, supported them during their studies. At the conservatoire, Jules was a diligent student; he graduated and became a successful violin teacher and conductor, and led his younger brother's orchestra for several years. By contrast, Jacques was bored by academic study and left after a year. The conservatoire's roll of students notes against his name [...] "Struck off on the 2December 1834 (left of his own free will)".|$|E
500|$|With Ron and Hermione's suggestion, Harry forms [...] "Dumbledore's Army", {{a secret}} study group aimed to teach his classmates the higher-level skills of Defence Against the Dark Arts {{that he has}} learned from his {{previous}} encounters with Dark wizards. Through <b>those</b> <b>lessons,</b> Harry begins to develop a crush on the popular and attractive Cho Chang. Juggling schoolwork, Umbridge's incessant and persistent efforts to land him in trouble and the defensive lessons, Harry begins to lose sleep as he constantly receives disturbing dreams about a dark corridor in the Ministry of Magic, followed by a burning desire. An important prophecy concerning Harry and Lord Voldemort is then revealed, and Harry discovers that he and Voldemort have a painful connection, allowing Harry to view some of Voldemort's actions telepathically. In the novel's climax, Harry is tricked into seeing Sirius tortured and races to the Ministry of Magic. He and his friends face off against Voldemort's followers nicknamed Death Eaters at the Ministry of Magic. Although the timely arrival {{of members of the}} Order of the Phoenix saves the teenagers' lives, Sirius Black is killed in the conflict.|$|E

500|$|After Sony {{canceled}} {{their shared}} universe plans and started sharing the Spider-Man character with Marvel Studios, multiple critics discussed their failure at replicating the MCU. Scott Meslow of The Week noted the perceived flaws {{of the first}} Amazing Spider-Man film, outside of its lead performances, and how the sequel [...] "doubles down on all the missteps of the original while adding a few of its own. …We now have a textbook example of how not to reboot a superhero franchise, and if Sony and Marvel are wise, they'll take virtually all <b>those</b> <b>lessons</b> to heart as they chart Spider-Man's next course." [...] Scott Mendelson noted that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 [...] "was sold as less a sequel to The Amazing Spider-Man than a backdoor pilot for Spider-Man vs. the Sinister Six. …Had Sony stuck with the original plan of a scaled-down superhero franchise, one that really was rooted in romantic drama, they would have at least stuck out in a crowded field of superhero franchises. When every superhero film is now going bigger, Amazing Spider-Man could have distinguished itself by going small and intimate." [...] This would have saved Sony [...] "a boatload of money", and potentially reversed the film's relative financial failure.|$|E

40|$|Since the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) {{was passed}} in 2001, museum {{educators}} have faced new challenges in designing programming that incorporates state standards of education while remaining faithful {{to the integrity of}} the museum’s collection and mission. Some museums have created programs that address these educational standards and can be used in school classrooms. This project is a case study of how one Virginia museum, Preservation Virginia, created a classroom program that addresses the state mandated Standards of Learning (SOLs). The report of this project includes discussion of the current debates that surround NCLB and its relationship to museum education.

60|$|There was at {{that time}} a music class held at a certain elegant room near Osnaburgh Church in the New Road, at which Maryanne and her friend Miss Twizzle were {{accustomed}} to attend. <b>Those</b> <b>lessons</b> were sometimes prosecuted in the evening, and those evening studies sometimes resulted in a little dance.

He was soon expert in all the figures of the mazy dance, and was excelled by no one in the agility of his step or the endurance of his performances. It was by degrees rumoured about that he was something higher than he seemed to be, and those best accustomed to the place used to call him the Poet.
