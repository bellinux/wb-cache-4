5|$|A Malaysian {{species of}} ant in the Camponotus cylindricus group has {{enlarged}} mandibular glands <b>that</b> <b>extend</b> into their gaster. When disturbed, workers rupture the membrane of the gaster, causing {{a burst of}} secretions containing acetophenones and other chemicals that immobilise small insect attackers. The worker subsequently dies.|$|E
5|$|According to Li (2005), several {{morphological}} {{features of}} A. longicervia indicate {{a close relationship}} to Sarraceniaceae: both taxa exhibit one or two pitcher wings, a smooth peristome, and pitchers <b>that</b> <b>extend</b> vertically {{from the top of}} a short petiole.|$|E
5|$|Each {{level has}} {{a time limit}} of ten minutes, which ends the game if it is exceeded. A player losing all lives is {{presented}} with a choice to continue or return to the title screen. Power-ups scattered across each world, presented as picture frames, include carrots <b>that</b> <b>extend</b> Robbit's health, extra lives, time-outs that stop the clock and freeze the level's dynamics for a few seconds, hourglasses <b>that</b> <b>extend</b> the player's time, and power pills that make Robbit invincible {{for a short period}} of time. Enemies in the game vary from anthropomorphic versions of creatures to robots and plants.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the animals}} in the spruce-fir forest have ranges <b>that</b> <b>extend</b> into the balsam fir forest higher up.

5|$|The stinkhorn species Clathrus columnatus {{somewhat}} resembles P.fusiformis {{in that it}} has 3 or 4 arms <b>that</b> <b>extend</b> upwards {{and join}} at the top. However, unlike C.columnatus, the arms of P.fusiformis share a common stem, and the immature egg-form is gray or grayish brown, rather than white.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Army's {{modernization}} {{effort in}} the 1980s corps units introduced new organizations and equipment including the M1 Abrams tank, M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle, AH-64 Apache helicopter, Multiple Launch Rocket System, and Mobile Subscriber Equipment. In 1987, III Corps also conducted the largest deployment of forces to Germany since the Second World War, Exercise Reforger '87. During this time, the corps began assisting in the training and support of active and reserve component units. This support involves training guidance, resources, {{and the maintenance of}} relationships <b>that</b> <b>extend</b> to wartime affiliations.|$|E

5|$|Atrophic acne scars {{have lost}} {{collagen}} from the healing response {{and are the}} most common type of acne scar (account for approximately 75% of all acne scars). They may be further classified as ice-pick scars, boxcar scars, and rolling scars. Ice-pick scars are narrow (less than 2mm across), deep scars <b>that</b> <b>extend</b> into the dermis. Boxcar scars are round or ovoid indented scars with sharp borders and vary in size from 1.5–4mm across. Rolling scars are wider than icepick and boxcar scars (4–5mm across) and have a wave-like pattern of depth in the skin.|$|E
5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare can {{be grown}} in pure culture on agar-containing plates {{supplemented}} with nutrients. The colonies that grow are white to pale cream, and cover the agar surface within six weeks from the initial inoculation. The mycelium is made of bent-over hyphae, without any aerial hyphae (hyphae <b>that</b> <b>extend</b> above {{the surface of the}} agar). Typically, two indistinct zones develop at about 6mm and 15mm from the initial inoculum spot, with each zone roughly 4mm wide. The zones appear somewhat lighter in color because the hyphae are more closely packed and form crystalline substances that deposit into the agar.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopods {{also have}} colorless blood, {{circulated}} by a muscular heart {{lying in the}} dorsal {{part of the body}} above the stomach. The blood passes through vessels <b>that</b> <b>extend</b> to the front and back of the body, and branch to organs including the lophophore at the front and the gut, muscles, gonads and nephridia at the rear. The blood circulation seems not to be completely closed, and the coelomic fluid and blood must mix to a degree. The main function of the blood may be to deliver nutrients.|$|E

Studies comparing cognitive functions before and after treatment for severe malarial illness continued to show significantly impaired school performance and cognitive abilities even after recovery. Consequently, severe and cerebral malaria have far-reaching socioeconomic consequences <b>that</b> <b>extend</b> beyond the immediate effects of the disease.|$|E
5|$|Myriostoma {{had been}} {{classified}} in the family Geastraceae until 1973, when British mycologist Donald Dring placed it in the Astraeaceae based {{on the presence of}} trabeculae (stout columns <b>that</b> <b>extend</b> from the peridium to the central core of the fruit body) in the gleba, and the absence of a true hymenium. In his 1989 monograph, Stellan Sunhede returned it to the Geastraceae. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences has confirmed the traditional belief that Myriostoma and Geastrum are closely related.|$|E

On 17 March, Australia agreed to lead the search in the southern locus from Sumatra to the southern Indian Ocean; the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), Australia's search and rescue agency, initially coordinated the search within Australia's SAR region, correlating information with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) and officials in Malaysia.|$|E

5|$|The thorax {{is divided}} into two groups of somites. The {{anterior}} group is composed of four somites, each with well-developed walking limbs with lengths <b>that</b> <b>extend</b> past the margins of the carapace. Their morphological details are not well preserved but their distal segments appear to possess a multitude of small spines. It is unknown if these limbs are biramous, but they are assumed to be the endopodites, the inner branches (ramus) of the leg, with the exopodites, or outer branches, absent or not preserved.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} often {{confused}} with the copperhead, A. contortrix. This {{is especially true for}} juveniles, but differences exist. A. piscivorus has broad, dark stripes on the sides of its head <b>that</b> <b>extend</b> back from the eye, whereas A. contortrix has only a thin, dark line that divides the pale supralabials from the somewhat darker color of the head. The watersnakes of the genus Nerodia are also similar in appearance, being thick-bodied with large heads, but they have round pupils, no loreal pit, a single anal plate, subcaudal scales that are divided throughout, and a distinctive overall color pattern.|$|E
5|$|Tiller {{effect is}} the {{expression}} {{used to describe}} how handlebars <b>that</b> <b>extend</b> far behind the steering axis (head tube) act like a tiller on a boat, in that one moves the bars to the right in order to turn the front wheel to the left, and vice versa. This situation is commonly found on cruiser bicycles, some recumbents, and some motorcycles. It can be troublesome when it limits the ability to steer because of interference or the limits of arm reach.|$|E
