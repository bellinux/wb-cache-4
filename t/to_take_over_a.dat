5|$|Many of the {{corporate}} raiders were onetime clients of Michael Milken, whose investment banking firm Drexel Burnham Lambert helped raise blind pools of capital with which corporate raiders could make a legitimate attempt <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> company and provided high-yield debt financing of the buyouts.|$|E
5|$|One {{scene that}} von Stroheim re-shot at the studio's insistence {{depicted}} a younger McTeague in his apprenticeship with Potter. In the scene McTeague is {{too embarrassed to}} examine the teeth {{of a young woman}} and Potter has <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over.</b> <b>A</b> thinly disguised ZaSu Pitts portrayed the woman so that the audience would see a resemblance to Trina, but the studio insisted that the scene was confusing and von Stroheim agreed to re-shoot it. Von Stroheim also conceded his original vision when shooting the bar confrontation between McTeague and Schouler. The director wanted to have a knife thrower actually throw a real knife at Gibson Gowland's head. Von Stroheim was overruled by Gowland himself, who refused to allow such a dangerous stunt. A special-effect shot was used instead.|$|E
5|$|Since 1887, {{the borough}} has {{included}} the former villages of Southcote and Whitley and small parts of Earley and Tilehurst. By 1911, it also encompassed the Oxfordshire village of Caversham {{and still more}} of Tilehurst. A small area of Mapledurham parish was added in 1977. An attempt <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> small area of Eye and Dunsden parish in Oxfordshire was rejected because of strong local opposition in 1997. Today the borough itself is unparished, and the wards used to elect the borough councillors generally ignore the old parish boundaries and use invented ward names.|$|E

5|$|If {{the player}} wishes <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> {{territory}} through diplomatic means, they must initiate {{dialogue with the}} local leader. If the player has a high enough popularity, the local leader may invite them to a sporting event, such as elephant race or a game hunting session, which will give the player an opportunity to unite that territory under their faction. If the player's popularity is not high enough, they may hold a Durbar festival {{in an attempt to}} impress the local leaders. If diplomacy fails, the player has the option to invade any territory by force. Soldiers can be hired through payments of gold; however, if the player does not have a sufficient amount of gold {{at the end of the}} turn, a rebellion may start. Rebellions will sometimes initiate lethal encounters with assassins, in which the player-character must defend themselves through sword combat. Additionally, the player can bring assassins to their side by successfully launching an attack on their temple. The game will end once either all of the territories are united, or if the player-character is assassinated.|$|E

The dispute bodies will also consider the risk of confusion, based on the domain name itself rather than the content of the site. For one domain, , the issue of ownership was subject to a Supreme Court case.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{hard times}} follow, with the Autobots {{becoming}} a corrupt galactic police force. While shutting down an Energon-mining operation, they incite a riot by beating an outspoken miner to death. The riot is extinguished, {{resulting in the}} miners either dead or imprisoned. A surviving miner, Megatron, manages <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> prison shuttle and hide it in Kaon, the seediest city on Cybertron. Megatron makes {{a name for himself}} in the underground gladiatorial matches, learning to enjoy the kill. He recruits the Seekers, Soundwave, and the future Cassetticons to perform acts of terrorism throughout Cybertron. Megatron rallies a large group of gladiators and proposes for them to unite under the same badge, but they are caught and arrested by Sentinel Prime's police force. However, this is part of Megatron's plan, as Starscream kills the Autobot Senate. Megatron kills Sentinel Prime, and the newly forged Decepticons take over the city-state of Kaon, heralding the beginning of the war. The populace at large is distracted by mass sports race games, with racers like the arrogant but talented Blurr becoming celebrities. Early on during the war, both Autobot and Decepticon try to recruit Blurr to their cause, with a young Optimus talking Blurr into saving the life of Zeta Prime from Starscream's assassination squad. A rookie Tracks is saved from the elite Predacons by special ops soldier Jazz. In later years, Tracks passes on the story of the lone Autobot to boost morale in times of crisis.|$|E

Bolz readily declared that he would like <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> ministerial post in the new government after Hitler was overthrown. Goerdeler put him down as Culture Minister in the cabinet that he foresaw having to put together. Among other things, this would have meant that Bolz would be taking Goebbels's place.|$|E

50|$|In the 1880s, Walker {{moved from}} Mansfield <b>to</b> Leicester <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>an</b> {{established}} butcher's {{shop in the}} high street. Meat rationing after World War II saw the factory output drop dramatically, and so in 1948 the company starting looking at alternative products.

25|$|In January 2006, Sheffield United {{became the}} first foreign club <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> Chinese team when they {{purchased}} the football club Chengdu Wuniu, based {{in the city of}} Chengdu, China.

United sold on their share of the Chinese side in 2010, following Chengdu's implication in a match-fixing scandal and increasing financial pressures on the English club.|$|E

His moderation was not shared by all, and the Northern Reform Union, represented by Charles Attwood, John Fife and Charles Larkin, tried <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> major meeting in 1832, a move Losh countered.|$|E
25|$|Males {{can remain}} in a {{reproductive}} unit for four to five years. While geladas have traditionally been considered to have a male-transfer society, many males appear {{to be likely to}} return and breed in their natal bands. Nevertheless, gelada males leave their natal units and try <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> unit of their own. A male can take over a reproductive unit either through direct aggression and fighting or by joining one as a subordinate and taking some females with him to create a new unit. When more than one male is in a unit, only one of them can mate with the females. The females in the group together can have power over the dominant male. When a new male tries <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> unit and overthrow the resident male, the females can choose to support or oppose him. The male maintains his relationship with the females by grooming them rather than forcing his dominance, in contrast to the society of the hamadryas baboon. Females accept a male into the unit by presenting themselves to him. Not all the females may interact with the male. Usually, one may serve as his main partner. The male may sometimes be monopolized by this female. The male may try to interact with the other females, but they are usually unresponsive.|$|E
