5|$|The Australian Army's pre-war {{doctrine}} {{was focused}} on conventional warfare in a European environment. This doctrine and the supporting training manuals were common to those of all Commonwealth countries. Following the outbreak of war the Army continued to focus on preparing its units to fight in Europe and North Africa. By far the single greatest difficulty in training in the early war years was the shortage of equipment. However, there were also critical shortages of instructors. The decision to form the 1st Armoured Division created a requirement for large numbers of highly skilled personnel, but there were few officers and men with <b>the</b> <b>required</b> <b>skills</b> in the small pre-war Army {{and many of them}} were already serving in the AIF's divisional mechanised cavalry regiments. An Armoured Fighting Vehicles School was created at Puckapunyal, Victoria, in 1941, and in March 1943, the Armoured Corps Training Centre was moved there.|$|E

Two years later, it rose to 807.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the growth}} of {{industry}} in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and in particular {{the growth of}} those industries associated with commercial glass production, metal trades, metallurgy and the associated technical advancements, the scene was set for the revival of stained glass manufacture and the development of that industry on an unprecedented scale. Thomas Willement, a plumber and glazier, produced his first armourial window in 1811, and is known as the father of the 19th-century stained glass industry.

2500|$|For instance, {{students}} {{who engage in}} neutralisation to justify cheating, even once, {{are more likely to}} engage in it in the future, potentially putting them on a road to a life of dishonesty. [...] Indeed, one study found that {{students who}} are dishonest in class are {{more likely to engage in}} fraud and theft on the job when they enter the workplace. Students are also negatively affected by academic dishonesty after graduation. A university diploma is an important document in the labor market. Potential employers use a degree as a representation of a graduate's knowledge and ability. However, due to academic dishonesty, not all graduates with the same grades actually did the same work or have the same skills. Thus, when faced with the fact that they do not know which graduates are skilled and which are the [...] "lemons" [...] (see [...] "The Market for Lemons"), employers must pay all graduates based on the quality of the average graduate. Therefore, the more students who cheat, getting by without achieving <b>the</b> <b>required</b> <b>skills</b> or learning, the lower the quality of the average graduate of a school, and thus the less employers are willing to pay a new hire from that school. Because of this reason, all students, even those that do not cheat themselves, are negatively affected by academic misconduct.|$|E

To assess occupational exposure to needle stick and sharp injuries and associated factors among health care workers in Awi zone, 2016. Methods. institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted among 193 health care workers. Study participants were selected using systematic random sampling technique. Result. When queried, 18. 7 % of the respondents’ encountered needle stick and sharp injury in the last 1 year. Participants who practiced needle recapping and had job related stress were 21. 3 and 7. 3 times more likely to face needle stick and sharp injury, respectively. However, those who apply universal precautions and acquire <b>the</b> <b>required</b> <b>skill</b> were 99 % and 96 % times less likely to face needle stick and sharp injury, respectively, than their counterparts. Conclusion and Recommendation. The prevalence of needle stick and sharp injury was relatively low as compared to previous studies. Recapping of needle after use, job related stress, not applying universal precautions, and lack of <b>the</b> <b>required</b> <b>skill</b> were associated with needle stick and sharp injuries. Therefore, health care providers should apply universal precaution...|$|R
