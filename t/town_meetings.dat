5|$|Although the {{suffrage}} {{movement in}} Wales attempted {{to show a}} level of independence, it was always following rather than leading a national agenda. It depended deeply in its embryonic years on celebrated suffragists from outside its borders to bring crowds to <b>town</b> <b>meetings,</b> but still relied on a network of now forgotten non-militant supporters who organised and campaigned on the ground level. And, although failing to significantly draw a rural Welsh-speaking heartland to its cause, it still embraced a national sense of pride and values that contrasted to their neighbours in England.|$|E
5|$|Andros was {{commissioned}} governor of New England in 1686. He had earned the enmity {{of the local}} populace by enforcing the restrictive Navigation Acts, denying the validity of existing land titles, restricting <b>town</b> <b>meetings,</b> and appointing unpopular regular officers to lead colonial militia, among other actions. Furthermore, he had infuriated Puritans in Boston by promoting the Church of England, which was rejected by many Nonconformist New England colonists.|$|E
5|$|Great Britain {{responded to}} the Boston Tea Party in 1774 with the Coercive Acts. The first of these acts was the Boston Port Act, which closed Boston's {{commerce}} until the East India Company had been repaid for the destroyed tea. The Massachusetts Government Act rewrote the Massachusetts Charter, making many officials royally appointed rather than elected, and severely restricting the activities of <b>town</b> <b>meetings.</b> The Administration of Justice Act allowed colonists charged with crimes to be transported to another colony or to Great Britain for trial. A new royal governor was appointed to enforce the acts: General Thomas Gage, who was also commander of British military forces in North America.|$|E

5|$|The {{architectural}} firm Ellerbe Becket, {{in association with}} Loschky Marquardt & Nesholm Architects of Seattle, designed the 1,500,000sqft(140,000m2) project. Allen was closely involved during the design process. While growing up he attended games at the University of Washington's outdoor Husky Stadium.

The exhibition center portion of the project was designed over a period of 14months by Loschky Marquardt & Nesholm Architects while First & Goal managed the construction. <b>Town</b> <b>meetings</b> were held to discuss the impact on the public, and the company created a $6million mitigation fund for nearby neighborhoods. In accordance with a program established by the building team, contracts totaling $81million were awarded to minority- and women-owned businesses. Union apprentices made up 19% of the workforce through another program with local trade unions.|$|E
5|$|With the war underway, Hancock {{made his}} way to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia with the other Massachusetts delegates. On May 24, 1775, he was {{unanimously}} elected President of the Continental Congress, succeeding Peyton Randolph after Henry Middleton declined the nomination. Hancock was a good choice for president for several reasons. He was experienced, having often presided over legislative bodies and <b>town</b> <b>meetings</b> in Massachusetts. His wealth and social standing inspired the confidence of moderate delegates, while his association with Boston radicals made him acceptable to other radicals. His position was somewhat ambiguous, because the role of the president was not fully defined, and it was not clear if Randolph had resigned or was on a leave of absence. Like other presidents of Congress, Hancock's authority was mostly limited to that of a presiding officer. He also had to handle a great deal of official correspondence, and he found it necessary to hire clerks at his own expense to help with the paperwork.|$|E
25|$|In New England, <b>Town</b> <b>meetings</b> {{are often}} used, {{especially}} in rural areas, to manage local government. This creates a hybrid form of government, {{with a local}} direct democracy and a state government which is representative. For example, most Vermont towns hold annual <b>town</b> <b>meetings</b> in March in which town officers are elected, budgets for the town and schools are voted on, and citizens {{have the opportunity to}} speak and be heard on political matters.|$|E
25|$|Acton {{uses the}} Open <b>Town</b> <b>Meeting</b> form of <b>town</b> government.

Citizens may force a special <b>town</b> <b>meeting</b> by submitting a petition signed by 200 registered voters to the town clerk.
