5|$|Taylor and Hessey <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{had sold}} nearly two {{editions of the}} Characters of Shakespear's Plays in about three months, but that after the Quarterly Review of them came out, they never sold another copy.|$|E
25|$|Six of the escapees {{were there}} and we talked for about three hours with me trying to persuade them to come back. They <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had {{sent a letter to}} the Minister of Justice Bakoa Kaltongga, {{complaining}} that they had been at ‘Container City’ since June in very confined areas, not allowed visitation rights and had no chance to see their chiefs for rehabilitation.|$|E
25|$|Arkan {{became an}} {{untouchable}} criminal figure in Belgrade {{and all of}} the former Yugoslavia. He was really so powerful, so strong financially that no one could do anything about him.... In 1993, I learned that Željko Ražnatović, Arkan, had in Belgrade kidnapped and taken to Erdut and there killed Isa Lero... also a man from the criminal underground who had come into conflict with Arkan. I even found a witness to the murder. I publicly accused Arkan. I submitted a report to the police. The police inspectors came to see me. We talked about it. I gave them all the information I had, but then the police inspector <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were aware of it but that they were unable to prove it because of the fear among the potential witnesses. So the police were quite well-informed about his criminal activities, but {{it was very hard to}} prove anything or to bring charges because his support network was so widespread, and this can be shown through various newspaper articles and so on. In one television statement, I told him when we were debating on TV, that he had pulled a sock over his head more often than I had pulled one on my feet.|$|E

2500|$|They <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{had been}} refused {{medical care and}} had other {{requests}} unanswered and that other high risk prisoners had been moved out of container city to other prisons but not them and they felt it was unfair. They {{said that they were}} not allowed to exercise and were demanding to be relocated to another prison and that was the reason behind their escape." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2011, Ford {{promised to}} release a [...] "real {{comeback}} album" [...] {{later in the year}} with drummer Chuck Spradlin, saying that 2009's nu metal-inspired Wicked Wonderland, {{was too much of a}} collective project with ex-husband Jim Gillette. [...] "A lot of people have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> want a real Lita Ford album, and I know what they mean. They are going to get it", she was quoted as saying at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Others—such as Hussein Ibish and {{journalist}} Peter Hessler—believe its [...] "unlikely" [...] that the Brotherhood {{will return to}} political prominence soon, because of its aggressive but incompetent performance while in power. [...] According to Hessler, the group antagonized the powerful entrenched government institutions, the news media and millions of non-supporters, acting [...] "with just enough aggression to provoke an outsized response", while not having nearly enough military resources to defend itself against that response. It [...] "no longer leads the anti-government movement," [...] and has even lost its [...] "religious credibility", such that [...] "at mosques, even staunch opponents of the coup <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> wouldn't vote for the Brotherhood again." [...] Hessler also argues that the strong showing for the party in post-revolution elections exaggerated MB strength, noting that in one Upper Egytpian district (El-Balyana), the MB party had dominated the Presidential vote and nearly won a parliamentary seat, but the Brotherhood itself had only ten local members in a district of approximately six hundred thousand. Since then its support has declined drastically.|$|E

[...] "Mr. Longfellow <b>told</b> <b>me</b> once <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were to name a brand of flour for him, {{and that he had}} no redress." ...|$|R
5000|$|John Horgan fears {{recipients}} of large {{grants from the}} Templeton Foundation sometimes write what the Foundation wants rather than what they believe.Several areligious scientists <b>told</b> <b>me</b> privately <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{did not want to}} challenge the beliefs of religious speakers for fear of offending them and the Templeton hosts.|$|R

"Samuel Lawrence <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> while <b>they</b> were digging, a {{large man}} who {{appeared}} to be eight or nine feet high, came and sat on the ridge of the barn, and motioned to them <b>that</b> <b>they</b> must leave. <b>They</b> motioned back <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would not; but <b>that</b> <b>they</b> afterwards became frightened and did leave." ...|$|R
2500|$|Romain Dillet of TechCrunch focused {{mostly on}} the iPad in his review, writing that iOS 11 [...] "turns your iPad into a {{completely}} different machine", with [...] "much more efficient" [...] multitasking and improved ease of access with the application dock. He also praised the design overhaul of the App Store, calling it [...] "a huge improvement compared to the previous App Store", and also highlighted design changes in other apps, including [...] "a huge bold header {{with the name of}} the app or section". Although he acknowledged that [...] "Many tech friends have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> hate this change", Dillet stated that [...] "I think most people will like it. It’s visually pleasing and distinctive". He stated that augmented reality will become more relevant in the days following the iOS 11 release as third-party developers incorporate features into their apps, and praised Apple for creating the ARKit development tools as it [...] "makes it much easier to implement augmented reality features". In conclusion, Dillet wrote that [...] "Ten years ago, iOS started as a constrained operating system. It {{is now one of the}} biggest digital playgrounds".|$|E

6000|$|... "I thought," [...] {{she said}} to Captain Drake, [...] "that I should see four huge and bearded paladins. You <b>told</b> <b>me</b> indeed <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were young, but I had not pictured to myself <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were still beardless striplings, {{although}} in point of size they do credit to their native country.|$|R
5000|$|But Samuel Moniac, a Creek warrior, testified August 2, 1813 {{after the}} events, “High Head <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> when <b>they</b> went back with their supply, another body of men {{would go down}} for another supply of ammunition; and that ten men were {{to go out of}} town, and they {{calculated}} on 'five horse-loads for every town'.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about <b>that,</b> too. <b>They</b> {{were going}} to swindle some folks, and Abe heard about it and gave the thing away. Abe won't stand for {{anything}} that ain't strictly honest." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, sir; all carried clubs. And they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{had been}} {{especially}} ordered {{not to take}} knives, and had indeed been searched before they came out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Madame Melmotte <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{last night}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{were all going}} down to Caversham to stay {{three or four days}} with the Longestaffes. She spoke of Lady Pomona as quite her {{particular}} friend.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have done}} no such thing. You <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{yourself}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{were not to}} be kept apart. He comes here, and it would be very odd indeed if I were to tell the servants that he is not to be admitted. If you want to quarrel with me, of course you can. I have always endeavoured to be a good friend to Emily." ...|$|R
50|$|People {{who have}} moved into the area not knowing the old story have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> from {{observation}} <b>they</b> believe the house is haunted. They were very interested, of course, to hear confirmation of a conclusion they had arrived at independently.|$|R
6000|$|... "Peter Stebbins <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{should be}} along tonight, with friends," [...] said Simeon, significantly, {{as he was}} washing his hands at a neat sink, in a little back porch.|$|E

6000|$|... 'It {{is for her}} birthday, Tuesday,' said Violet. 'They are to have a steamer to Richmond, walk {{about and}} dine there; but I should not {{think that it would}} be very pleasant. Mrs. Bryanstone had one of these parties last year to Hampton Court, and she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> unless <b>they</b> were well managed they were the most disagreeable things in the world; people always were losing each other, and getting into scrapes. She {{declared}} she never would have another.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only my Christian name, {{and that}} I am quite sure she never {{mentioned}} to anyone. She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> once <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were all rather curious to learn who I was, {{and that she}} invariably told them my name was Prince Charming. It was pretty of her. You must do me a drawing of Sibyl, Basil. I should like to have something more of her than {{the memory of a}} few kisses and some broken pathetic words." ...|$|R
5000|$|He asked Scott if he {{knew what}} he was getting into. [...] "I told him we've never had any black drivers, and you're going to be knocked around," [...] Poston said. [...] "He said, 'I can take it.'" [...] Poston {{approved}} Scott's license. Later he confided to Scott that officials at NASCAR headquarters had not been pleased with his decision. [...] "He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> when <b>they</b> found out at Daytona Beach that he had signed me up, they raised hell with him," [...] Scott said.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. When {{she first}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had {{understood}} it so, I laughed--almost--it {{was so far}} from me. But now when {{you seem to have}} had the same idea--Did you all think so?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Tomorrow I shall {{set out in}} {{quest of}} Pellucidar and Dian. That is [...] if the Arabs don't get me. They have been very nasty of late.

6000|$|... "Why, I've {{heard it}} said that those letters are the one hope this country has! I have heard {{it said that}} but for those letters France and England would be as far apart to-day as they ever were. I heard it said only this {{afternoon}} that those letters were our only hope of peace. They were compared with the letters of Junius, whoever he was. Lord Cardington <b>told</b> <b>me</b> himself <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were the most splendid political prose he had ever read in his life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good!" [...] {{cried the}} Captain. [...] "I will {{join in the}} search, and take you in my ship. Some of my crew <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{yesterday}} <b>they</b> saw a young man, who looked like a prince, riding along the shore of a lake which adjoins the one we are on. In the morning we will sail after him. We shall keep near the shore, and your servant can mount your horse and ride {{along the edge of}} the lake. From what I know of the speed of this vessel, I think he can easily keep up with us." ...|$|R
