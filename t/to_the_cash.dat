25|$|Jenkin {{decided to}} limit the 1985/86 budget of 15 of these councils <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> level of their 1984/85 budget. In the cases of the GLC, ILEA and Greenwich, where budgets were over 70% above their grant-related expenditure, and had gone up by more than 30% since 1981/82, he placed the cap at 1½% below the 1984/85 budget. 16 out of the 18 councils were under {{majority}} control by Labour {{at the time they}} were designated. The exceptions were Portsmouth, where there was a Conservative majority, and Brent where no party had an overall majority. A Labour administration had held power but when Labour councillor Ambrozine Neil joined the Conservatives in December 1983, the Conservatives took control with Liberal support.|$|E
25|$|The {{consistently}} revenue-generating part of {{the company}} may have a much higher credit rating than the company as a whole. For instance, a leasing company may have provided $10m nominal value of leases, and it will receive a cash flow {{over the next five years}} from these. It cannot demand early repayment on the leases and so cannot get its money back early if required. If it could sell the rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> flows from the leases to someone else, it could transform that income stream into a lump sum today (in effect, receiving today the present value of a future cash flow). Where the originator is a bank or other organization that must meet capital adequacy requirements, the structure is usually more complex because a separate company is set up to buy the assets.|$|E

[...] Bryant said she freed herself, and Till said, [...] "You needn't be afraid of me, baby," [...] used [...] "one 'unprintable' word" [...] and said [...] "I've been with white women before." [...] Bryant also alleged that one of Till's companions came into the store, {{grabbed him by the}} arm, and ordered him to leave. According to historian Timothy Tyson, Bryant admitted to him in a 2008 interview that her testimony during the trial that Till had made verbal and physical advances was false.|$|E
500|$|The first {{export of}} tobacco from the then-colonies of the United States (specifically Virginia) to London showed {{fortunes}} in the English enterprise and by 1627, the Virginia tobacco was being shipped to London at 500,000 pounds a shipment. By 1637, tobacco {{had become the}} colony's currency and by 1639 Maryland was exporting 100,000 pounds of tobacco to London. [...] English success with the production of tobacco {{caught the attention of}} many Europeans, specifically those colonized on Martinique and Guadeloupe, French islands. These islands soon became wealthy due to the tobacco production and by 1671 roughly one-third of the acreage devoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> crops grown for the islands were for tobacco. While the cultivation of tobacco thrived, production saw severe depressions in later years due to the profits made from sugar. According to an account of the Barbadian exports 82 percent of the island's export value was due to sugar and less than one percent was accounted for by tobacco.|$|E
500|$|Although {{known in}} their early days as [...] "the Throstles", the club's more popular {{nickname}} among supporters came to be the Baggies, a term which the club itself looked down upon for many years but later embraced. The phrase was first heard at the Hawthorns in the 1900s, but its exact origins are uncertain. One suggestion is that the name was bestowed on Albion supporters by their rivals at Aston Villa, {{because of the large}} baggy trousers that many Albion fans wore at work to protect themselves from molten iron in the factories and foundries of the Black Country. Club historian Tony Matthews however suggests that it derives from the [...] "bagmen", who carried the club's matchday takings in big leather bags from the turnstiles <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> office on the halfway line. Other theories relate to the baggy shorts worn by various players during the club's early years. The official club mascots are named Baggie Bird and Albi; both are based on the throstle depicted on the club crest.|$|E

During the implementation trial phase, the default fare was charged at the Cash Fare less the customer's discount based on how they last reloaded their card. With {{the opening of the}} Mandurah railway line, the default fare for travel on all train services was increased to a seven-zone fare, due to the ability of passengers to transfer trains without tagging off/on.|$|E

2500|$|Leveraged buyouts {{involve a}} {{financial}} sponsor agreeing to an acquisition without itself committing all the capital {{required for the}} acquisition. [...] To do this, the financial sponsor will raise acquisition debt which ultimately looks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> flows of the acquisition target to make interest and principal payments. [...] Acquisition debt in an LBO is often non-recourse to the financial sponsor and has no claim on other investments managed by the financial sponsor. [...] Therefore, an LBO transaction's financial structure is particularly attractive to a fund's limited partners, allowing them the benefits of leverage but greatly limiting the degree of recourse of that leverage. [...] This kind of financing structure leverage benefits an LBO's financial sponsor in two ways: (1) the investor itself only needs to provide {{a fraction of the}} capital for the acquisition, and (2) the returns to the investor will be enhanced (as long as the return on assets exceeds the cost of the debt).|$|E
