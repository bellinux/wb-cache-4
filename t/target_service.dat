5|$|Agamemnons first <b>target</b> <b>service</b> {{took place}} before her {{modifications}} were completed. On 19 March 1921, she {{was exposed to}} a cloud of poisonous gas {{to determine the effect}} of gas on a battleship. It was found that gas could penetrate the ship via her various openings, but the ship had not been sealed against gas before the trial and no accurate results applicable to a commissioned battleship could be obtained. On 21 September, she was subjected to machine-gun fire by strafing aircraft. These trials showed that such strafing could harass a battleship, but could not impair her fighting or steaming capabilities, and helped to determine protection for bridge personnel.|$|E

500|$|The airline was {{established}} as Vestfoldfly by Øyvind Skaunfelt in 1961. He {{had been working}} at Thor Solberg's aviation school at Tønsberg Airport, Jarlsberg, and offered to purchase the school and airplanes when Solberg retired. Two years earlier, Sandefjord Airport, Torp had opened a civilian sector and Skaunfelt decided to establish his company there. In May 1961, he received government permission for commercial flying. He started a newspaper route to Oslo Airport, Fornebu, and could also carry three passengers in his single-engined Cessna. The route continued onwards from Sandefjord to Tønsberg, Larvik and at Skien Airport, Geiteryggen. Vestfoldfly also started offering scenic trips and charter. During the summer, the airline also flew seaplanes south along the coast to Kragerø, Risør and Arendal. Other activities involved crop dusting of forest for Felleskjøpet. The airline also provided a <b>target</b> <b>service</b> for the military. Four aircraft were permanently used to tow a target about [...] behind the aircraft, and military personnel would practice shooting at the target.|$|E

2500|$|The USAF's Air Education and Training Command (AETC) {{has been}} {{developing}} requirements for the T-38 replacement program since 2003. Originally, the replacement trainer was expected to enter service around 2020. A fatigue failure in 2008 killed the two-person crew of a T-38C, advancing the <b>target</b> <b>service</b> date to 2017. In the Fiscal 2013 budget proposal the USAF suggested delaying the initial operating capability to FY2020 with the contract award not expected before FY2016. Shrinking budgets {{and the need to}} fund higher priority modernization projects have pushed the IOC the T-X aircraft to [...] "fiscal year 2023 or 2024". [...] The delay was a direct result of budget constraints, so the T-X was pushed back to support higher Air Force priorities. [...] Although the program was left out of the FY 2014 budget entirely, the service still views the trainer as a priority.|$|E

The pilot addresses the need for ear-ly identification of employment barriers faced by welfare recipients and for the <b>targeting</b> of <b>services.</b> Welfare-to-work programs typically treat all recipients the same, providing the same basic services regardless of a participant’s skills, aptitudes, and motivation. Yet, barriers vary widely. Some customers require little assistance in finding a job, while others have multiple barriers and stand to benefit from more intensive, <b>targeted</b> <b>services.</b> 1 However, most Work First programs do not have sufficient funds to provide case managers for all customers who need more specialized attention and advocacy.
