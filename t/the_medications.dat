50|$|One of the {{side-effects}} of lipodystrophy is {{the rejection}} of <b>the</b> injected <b>medication,</b> <b>the</b> slowing down of the absorption of <b>the</b> <b>medication,</b> or trauma that can cause bleeding that, in turn, will reject <b>the</b> <b>medication.</b> In any of these scenarios, the dosage of <b>the</b> <b>medication,</b> such as insulin for diabetics, becomes impossible to gauge correctly and {{the treatment of the}} disease for which <b>the</b> <b>medication</b> is administered is impaired, thereby allowing the medical condition to worsen.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{understand}} and describe <b>the</b> meaning of <b>medications</b> for patients. Methods: A metasynthesis of three different, yet complementary qualitative research studies, {{was conducted by}} two researchers. The first study was a phenomenological study of patients’ medication experiences that used unstructured interviews. The second study was an ethnographic study of pharmaceutical care practice, which included participant observation, in-depth interviews and focus groups with patients of pharmaceutical care. The third was a phenomenological study of the chronic illness experience of medically uninsured individuals in the United States and included an explicit aim to understand <b>the</b> <b>medication</b> experience within that context. The two researchers who conducted these three qualitative studies that examined <b>the</b> <b>medication</b> experience performed <b>the</b> meta-synthesis. The process began with the researchers reviewing the themes of <b>the</b> <b>medication</b> experience for each study. The researchers then aggregated the themes to identify the overlapping and similar themes of <b>the</b> <b>medication</b> experience and which themes are sub-themes within another theme versus a unique theme of <b>the</b> <b>medication</b> experience. <b>The</b> researchers then used the analytic technique, “free imaginative variation” to determine the essential, structural themes of <b>the</b> <b>medication</b> experience. Results: <b>The</b> meaning of <b>medications</b> for patients was captured as four themes of <b>the</b> <b>medication</b> experience: a meaningful encounter; bodily effects; unremitting nature; and exerting control. <b>The</b> <b>medication</b> experience is an individual’s subjective experience of taking a medication in his daily life. It begins as an encounter with a medication. It is an encounter that is given meaning before it occurs. The experience may include positive or negative bodily effects. The unremitting nature of a chronic medication often causes an individual to question the need for <b>the</b> <b>medication.</b> Subsequently, <b>the</b> individual may exert control by altering the way he takes <b>the</b> <b>medication</b> and often {{in part because of}} the gained expertise with <b>the</b> <b>medication</b> in his own body. Conclusion: <b>The</b> <b>medication</b> experience is a practice concept that serves to understand patients’ experiences and to understand an individual patient’s medication experience and medication-taking behaviors in order to meet his or her medication-related needs...|$|R
5|$|The WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (EML), {{published}} by the World Health Organization (WHO), contains <b>the</b> <b>medications</b> considered {{to be most effective}} and safe to meet the most important needs in a health system. The list is frequently used by countries to help develop their own local lists of essential medicine. As of 2016, more than 155 countries have created national lists of essential medicines based on the World Health Organization's model list. This includes countries in both the developed and developing world.|$|E
5|$|The drug label advises that {{bupropion}} {{should not}} be prescribed to individuals with epilepsy or other conditions that lower the seizure threshold, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, active brain tumors, or concurrent alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use and/or withdrawal. It should be avoided in individuals who are also taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). When switching from MAOIs to bupropion, {{it is important to}} include a washout period of about two weeks between <b>the</b> <b>medications.</b> The label recommends that caution should be exercised when treating people with liver damage, severe kidney disease, and severe hypertension, and in children, adolescents and young adults due to the increased risk of suicidal ideation.|$|E
5|$|Adverse {{effects from}} {{medications}} {{are reported in}} 10 to 90% of people, depending on how and from whom the data is collected. Most adverse effects are dose-related and mild. Some examples include mood changes, sleepiness, or an unsteadiness in gait. Certain medications have side effects that {{are not related to}} dose such as rashes, liver toxicity, or suppression of the bone marrow. Up to a quarter of people stop treatment due to adverse effects. Some medications are associated with birth defects when used in pregnancy. Many of the common used medications, such as valproate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitol, and gabapentin have been reported to cause increased risk of birth defects, especially when used during the first trimester. Despite this, treatment is often continued once effective, because the risk of untreated epilepsy is believed to be greater than the risk of <b>the</b> <b>medications.</b> Among the antiepileptic medications, levetiracetam and lamotrigine seem to carry the lowest risk of causing birth defects.|$|E

5|$|On October5, a {{national}} disaster was declared for Jamaica {{due to the}} effects of Nicole. In response, the USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance provided US$50,000 for the purchase and delivery of relief supplies and fuel for emergency vehicles. About J$4million (US$46,800) was donated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to the Greenhouse Growers Association for the repair of greenhouses. In conjunction with the Food and Agriculture Organization, an estimated J$12million (US$140,400) was made available to initiate the planting of about 50,000 crop seedlings. The Veterinary Division provided financial assistance to livestock farmers and dispatched animal technicians with prophylactic medication and vitamins to avert foot rot disease in small ruminants, including goats and sheep. The cost of <b>the</b> <b>medications</b> was estimated at J$2million (US$23,400). The Banana Board's Catastrophe Fund, which at the time comprised J$50million (US$585,000), delivered both monetary support and human resources to local banana and plantain farmers.|$|E
5|$|Prevention of {{alcoholism}} may be attempted by regulating and limiting {{the sale of}} alcohol, taxing alcohol to increase its cost, and providing inexpensive treatment. Treatment may take several steps. Because of the medical problems that can occur during withdrawal, alcohol detoxification should be carefully controlled. One common method {{involves the use of}} benzodiazepine medications, such as diazepam. This can be either given while admitted to a health care institution or occasionally while a person remains in the community with close supervision. Other addictions or mental illness may complicate treatment. After detoxification support such as group therapy or support groups are used to help keep a person from returning to drinking. One commonly used form of support is the group Alcoholics Anonymous. <b>The</b> <b>medications</b> acamprosate, disulfiram, or naltrexone may also be used to help prevent further drinking.|$|E
5|$|While benzodiazepines {{may have}} {{short-term}} benefits for anxiety, sleep and agitation in some patients, long-term (i.e., greater than 2–4 weeks) use {{can result in}} a worsening of the very symptoms <b>the</b> <b>medications</b> are meant to treat. Potential explanations include exacerbating cognitive problems that are already common in anxiety disorders, causing or worsening depression and suicidality, disrupting sleep architecture by inhibiting deep stage sleep, withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms in between doses mimicking or exacerbating underlying anxiety or sleep disorders, inhibiting the benefits of psychotherapy by inhibiting memory consolidation and reducing fear extinction, and reducing coping with trauma/stress and increasing vulnerability to future stress. Anxiety, insomnia and irritability may be temporarily exacerbated during withdrawal, but psychiatric symptoms after discontinuation are usually less than even while taking benzodiazepines. Fortunately, for those with benzodiazepine-induced problems, functioning significantly improves within 1 year of discontinuation.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>The</b> <b>medication</b> cart can {{be filled}} using an {{automated}} system or a manual method and when using a manual method <b>the</b> <b>medication</b> {{can be arranged}} either by round time or by <b>medication</b> name. For <b>the</b> manual methods, it is hypothesized that the latter method {{would result in a}} lower frequency of medication administration errors because nurses are forced to read <b>the</b> <b>medication</b> labels, but evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} compare <b>the</b> frequency of <b>medication</b> administration errors of two different manual medication cart filling methods, namely arranging medication by round time or by medication name. Design: A prospective, observational study with a before-after design. Participants and settings: Eighty-six patients who stayed on an orthopaedic ward in one university medical centre in the Netherlands were included. Methods: Disguised observation was used to detect <b>medication</b> administration errors. <b>The</b> <b>medication</b> cart filling method in usual care was to fill <b>the</b> cart with <b>medication</b> arranged by round time. The intervention was the implementation of <b>the</b> second <b>medication</b> cart filling method, where <b>the</b> <b>medication</b> cart was filled by arranging medicines by their names. The primary outcome was <b>the</b> frequency of <b>medication</b> administrations with one or more error(s) after the intervention compared with before the intervention. The secondary outcome was the frequency of subtypes of medication administration errors. Results: After the intervention 170 of 740 (23. 0 %) medication administrations with one or more medication administration error(s) were observed compared to 114 of 589 (19. 4 %) before the intervention (odds ratio 1. 24 [95 % confidence interval 0. 95 - 1. 62]). The distribution of subtypes of medication administration errors before and after the intervention was statistically significantly different (p < 0. 001). Analysis of subtypes revealed more omissions and wrong time errors after the intervention than before <b>the</b> intervention. Unauthorized <b>medication</b> errors were detected more frequently before the intervention than after the intervention. Conclusion: <b>The</b> frequency of <b>medication</b> administration errors with <b>the</b> <b>medication</b> cart filling method where <b>the</b> <b>medication</b> is arranged by name was not statistically significantly different compared to <b>the</b> <b>medication</b> cart filling method where <b>the</b> <b>medication</b> is arranged by round time.
