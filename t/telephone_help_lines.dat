40|$|Abstract Background Sports {{and arts}} based {{services}} for children have positive impacts on their mental and physical health. The charity sector provides such services, often set up in response to local communities expressing a need. The present study maps resilience promoting services provided by children's charities in England. Specifically, the prominence of sports and arts activities, and types of mental health provisions including telephone help-lines, are investigated. Findings The study was a cross-sectional web-based survey of chief executives, senior mangers, directors and chairs of charities providing {{services for children}} under the age of 16. The aims, objectives and activities of participating children's charities and those providing mental health services were described overall. In total 167 chief executives, senior managers, directors and chairs of charities in England agreed to complete the survey. From our sample of charities, arts activities were the most frequently provided services (58 / 167, 35 %), followed by counselling (55 / 167, 33 %) and sports activities (36 / 167, 22 %). Only 13 % (22 / 167) of charities expected their work to contribute to the health legacy of the 2012 London Olympics. <b>Telephone</b> <b>help</b> <b>lines</b> were provided by 16 % of the charities that promote mental health.

40|$|Abstract Background Unscheduled care {{is defined}} here as when someone seeks {{treatment}} or advice for a health problem without arranging {{to do so}} {{more than a day}} in advance. Recent health policy initiatives in England have focused on introducing new services such as NHS Direct and walk in centres into the unscheduled care system. This study used population surveys to explore the effect of these new services on the use of traditional providers of unscheduled care, and to improve understanding of help seeking behaviour within the system of unscheduled care. Methods Cross-sectional population postal surveys were undertaken annually over the five year period 1998 to 2002 in two geographical areas in England. Each year questionnaires were sent to 5000 members of the general population in each area. Results The response rate was 69 % (33, 602 / 48, 883). Over the five year period 16 % (5223 / 33602) 95 %CI (15. 9 to 16. 1) of respondents had an unscheduled episode in the previous four weeks and this remained stable over time (p = 0. 170). There was an increased use of <b>telephone</b> <b>help</b> <b>lines</b> over the five years, reflecting the change in service provision (p = 0. 008). However, there was no change in use of traditional services over this time period. Respondents were most likely to seek help from general practitioners (GPs), family and friends, and pharmacists, used by 9. 0 %, 7. 2 % and 6. 3 % respectively of the 5815 respondents in 2002. Most episodes involved contact with a single service only: 7. 0 % (2363 / 33, 602) of the population had one contact and 2 % (662 / 33602) had three or more contacts per episode. GPs were the most frequent point of first contact with services. Conclusion Introducing new services to the provision of unscheduled care did not affect the use of traditional services. A large majority of the population continued to turn to their GP for unscheduled health care. </p...|$|E

40|$|Since 1993, Amsterdam Antenna {{has been}} documenting and {{analysing}} trends in nightlife {{and substance use}} among Amsterdam young adults and adolescents. Our panel study traces the latest developments every year by holding individual, semi-annual interviews with a panel of avid nightlifers and professionals from various nightlife scenes. The main focus is on trendsetters who try out new types of music, events, nightspots and drugs, or who experiment with new variations on older themes. They also lead the way as particular drugs or styles go out of fashion. The panel study also focuses on neighbourhood and problem youth. It reports trends, signs and rumours from all these groups, but it provides no exact figures. Our annual survey, by comparison, delivers quantitative data about substance use in specific groups in the city: school-aged adolescents, young clients of youth services, cannabis coffeeshop customers, pubgoers and clubbers. The 2010 survey focuses {{for the third time}} on Amsterdam pubgoers. As in 2000 and 2005, we surveyed a wide range of customers in Amsterdam pubs and cafés. Our sample reliably represented the young adults and adolescents who were frequenting mainstream, trendy, gay and student pubs in 2010. Some trendsetters were amongst them, but most respondents could be considered trend followers and mainstreamers. A total of 590 pubgoers completed the questionnaire. Their average age was 27, and they were almost evenly split between males and females. Three quarters were of Dutch ethnicity. More than half lived alone, and the average pubgoer had a high level of education. Other statistics reported here derive from sources we call substance use prevention indicators. These provide quantitative data on the alcohol and drugs markets from several sources: requests for information or advice received via a <b>telephone</b> <b>help</b> <b>line</b> and a website; drug education contacts at dance events; and results from the testing of voluntarily submitted drugs. Altogether, the information reported in the various components of Antenna yields a diversified picture of developments and trends in Amsterdam’s world of recreational substances...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Iranians {{comprise}} {{an immigrant}} {{group that has}} a very different cultural background {{from that of the}} mainstream Canadian population and speaks a language other than English or French; in this case mainly Farsi (Persian). Although Iranian immigrants in Toronto receive a high proportion of care from Farsi-speaking family physicians and health care providers than physicians who cannot speak Farsi, they are still not satisfied with the provided services. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the obstacles and issues Iranian immigrants faced in accessing health care services as seen through the eyes of Iranian health care professionals/providers and social workers working in Greater Toronto Area, Canada. Methods Narrative inquiry was used to capture and understand the obstacles this immigrant population faces when accessing health care services, through the lens of fifty Iranian health care professionals/providers and social workers. Thirty three health care professionals and five social workers were interviewed. To capture the essence of issues, individual interviews were followed by three focus groups consisting of three health care professionals and one social worker in each group. Results Three major themes emerged from the study: language barrier and the lack of knowledge of Canadian health care services/systems; lack of trust in Canadian health care services due to financial limitations and fear of disclosure; and somatization and needs for psychological supports. Conclusion Iranians may not be satisfied with the Canadian health care services due to a lack of knowledge of the system, as well as cultural differences when seeking care, such as fear of disclosure, discrimination, and mistrust of primary care. To attain equitable, adequate, and effective access to health care services, immigrants need to be educated and informed about the Canadian health care system and services it provides. It would be of great benefit to this population to hold workshops on health topics, and mental health issues, build strong ties with the community by increasing their involvement, use plain language, design informative and health related websites in both Farsi and English, and provide a Farsi speaking <b>telephone</b> <b>help</b> <b>line</b> to answer their health related issues. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{global market}} for {{over-the-counter}} (OTC) medicinesis considerable and rising. In 1991, US consumers spent $ 10. 2 billion on OTC drugs, which {{had risen to}} $ 19. 1 bil-lion by 2000. Similar trends have been seen in UK and Eu-ropean markets. A combination of factors has fueled this worldwide increase in OTC sales. These include govern-ment healthcare policies that have encouraged self-care and self-medication coupled with {{a greater emphasis on}} cost containment by healthcare organizations. 1 - 5 At the same time, there has been an unprecedented {{rise in the number of}} medicines deregulated from prescription-only control to OTC status, aided by streamlined and less bu-reaucratic administration. 6 - 8 The UK is no exception. Recent notable government policy developments centering on self-care include encour-aging patients to use the community pharmacist as the first port of call for minor ailments and the introduction of nurse-led services such as National Health Service (NHS) Direct (a nurse-led <b>telephone</b> <b>help</b> <b>line).</b> 9, 10 Over 50 prescrip-tion-only drugs have been deregulated to Pharmacy Only status (restricted by UK law to sale in a pharmacy under su-pervision of a pharmacist) since the first, loperamide, was deregulated in 1983. The potential cost savings from direct medicine costs and indirect savings on freeing medical prac-titioner time have also been influential. 11 - 13 Probably of greatest impact to UK community pharma-cy practice is the continued deregulation of medicines. This has included products from new therapeutic classes (eg, antiemetics and histamine H 2 antagonists), allowing community pharmacists scope to manage more conditions without the need for medical referral. This trend looks set to continue, and potentially accelerate, if recent proposals to relax UK drug advertising are implemented. 14 With the availability of a wider choice from an arsenal of more potent medicines than before, it is important to know that, when pharmacist help is sought, the right ad-vice is given. Several studies have examined the perfor-mance of community pharmacists when giving advice on nonprescription drugs. The results are mixed: some show positive findings, 15 - 17 although more have voiced criticism of community pharmacy shortcomings both from within 17 - 22 and outside the profession, most notably from the U...|$|R
