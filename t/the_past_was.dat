5|$|Kenyatta's {{calls to}} forgive and forget <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>was</b> a {{keystone}} of his government. He preserved various {{elements of the}} old colonial order in his administration, particularly on issues of law and order. The police and military structures were left largely intact. White Kenyans were left in senior positions within the judiciary, civil service, and parliament, with the white Kenyans Bruce Mackenzie and Humphrey Slade being among Kenyatta's top officials.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the story, the two sides face off in a major battle that sees the deaths of many soldiers, {{including}} their leaders Larg and Goltana. Ramza manages to stop the bloodshed from continuing and rescues the general Cidolfas Orlandu, though the Church succeeds in eliminating the two Lions to secure its power over Ivalice. Deeper into the story, Ramza discovers that the Shrine Knights are in reality Lucavi, and the real conspirators behind the Church's plot. The Lucavi are seeking to resurrect their leader Altima, who in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>was</b> Saint Ajora, and they need much bloodshed and a suitable body to complete the resurrection. Alma is to serve as the host for Altima's incarnation. While racing off to find her, Ramza encounters Dycedarg - now a Lucavi demon - and witnesses Zalbag's death. Zalbag is then risen and converted into an undead servant, and frequently begs for death during the encounter.|$|E
5|$|Picard confronts Q, {{who tells}} him that {{although}} the bout with the Nausicaan nearly cost him his life, it also gave him a sense of his mortality. It taught him that life was too precious to squander by playing it safe. Picard realizes that his attempts to suppress and ignore {{the consequences of his}} indiscretions have resulted in him losing a part of himself. Picard then declares that he would rather die as captain of the Enterprise than live as a nobody. Q sends him back to the bar fight and events unfold as they did originally, with Picard being stabbed through the heart and laughing as he collapses to the floor. In the present, Picard awakens in sickbay, a Captain again. As Picard recovers from his injury, he wonders if his journey into <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>was</b> one of Q's tricks or merely a dream. Nevertheless, he is grateful for the insight the experience gave him.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>past</b> <b>is</b> a {{term used}} to {{indicate}} the totality of events that occurred before a given point in time. <b>The</b> <b>past</b> <b>is</b> contrasted with and defined by {{the present and the}} future.

5|$|Three legends are narrated to the {{establishment}} of the monastery. In the first legend it is said that location of the present Monastery was selected by a horse which belonged to Merag Lama Lodre Gyatso who was on a mission assigned to him by the 5th Dalai Lama to establish a Monastery. After an intense search, when he failed to locate a suitable place, he retired into a cave to offer prayers seeking divine intervention to choose the site. When {{he came out of the}} cave, he found his horse missing. He then went in search of the horse and finally found it grazing at the top of a mountain called Tana Mandekhang, which in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>was</b> the palace of King Kala Wangpo. He took this as a divine and auspicious guidance and decided to establish the monastery at that location. Seeking the help of the local people, Mera Lama established the monastery at that location in the latter part of 1681.|$|E
