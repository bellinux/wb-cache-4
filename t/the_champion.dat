5|$|An {{exception}} to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won <b>the</b> <b>Champions</b> League <b>the</b> year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter <b>the</b> <b>Champions</b> League, giving England five qualifiers. UEFA subsequently ruled that <b>the</b> defending <b>champions</b> qualify for <b>the</b> competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in <b>the</b> <b>Champions</b> League, this meant that if <b>the</b> <b>Champions</b> League winner finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it would qualify {{at the expense of}} the fourth-placed team in the league. At that time, no association could have more than four entrants in <b>the</b> <b>Champions</b> League. This occurred in 2012, when Chelsea – who had won <b>the</b> <b>Champions</b> League that summer, but finished sixth in the league – qualified for <b>the</b> <b>Champions</b> League in place of Tottenham Hotspur, who went into the Europa League.|$|R
