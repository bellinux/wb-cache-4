5|$|The {{cause of}} {{rumination}} syndrome is unknown. However, studies have drawn {{a correlation between}} hypothesized causes {{and the history of}} patients with <b>the</b> <b>disorder.</b> In infants and the cognitively impaired, the disease has normally been attributed to over-stimulation and under-stimulation from parents and caregivers, causing the individual to seek self-gratification and self-stimulus due to the lack or abundance of external stimuli. <b>The</b> <b>disorder</b> has also commonly been attributed to a bout of illness, a period of stress in the individual's recent past, and to changes in medication.|$|E
40|$|Taking a {{nucleation}} perspective, {{we study}} {{the nature of}} <b>the</b> <b>disordered</b> micelles in highly asymmetric, sphere-forming diblock copolymer melts using the self-consistent-field theory. The micelles are shown to correspond to strong, activated, localized composition fluctuations in <b>the</b> <b>disordered</b> state due to finite molecular weights. By {{taking into account the}} translational entropy of the micelles, we obtain the concentration and the free energy of <b>the</b> <b>disordered</b> micelles. <b>The</b> critical micelle temperature (in terms of the familiar combination χN), operationally defined to correspond to the onset of sufficient number of micelles in the system, is identified by invoking a criterion involving the concentration of micelles. <b>The</b> <b>disordered</b> micelles are part of <b>the</b> <b>disordered</b> phase, and <b>the</b> only phase transition between <b>the</b> <b>disordered</b> state and <b>the</b> ordered phase is the order−disorder transition (ODT). However, there exists a sharply defined temperature (higher than the critical micelle temperature), which we term the micelle dissociation temperature, beyond which micelles with finite lifetimes become impossible. The range of χN for <b>the</b> <b>disordered</b> micelles to be observable shrinks as N- 1 / 2 with increasing degrees of polymerization N of the copolymers. In the infinite molecular weight limit, the window vanishes and the mean-field phase diagram calculated by Matsen and Bates is recovered. <b>The</b> <b>disordered</b> micelles, as a part of <b>the</b> <b>disordered</b> phase, contribute to the increased scattering intensity and the low-q shift of the structure factor in diblock copolymer melts near the ODT...|$|R

5|$|Prevention of {{schizophrenia}} is difficult {{as there are}} no reliable markers for the later development of <b>the</b> <b>disorder.</b> There is tentative evidence for the effectiveness of early interventions to prevent schizophrenia.

Attempting to prevent schizophrenia in the prodrome phase is of uncertain benefit and therefore as of 2009 is not recommended. Cognitive behavioral therapy may reduce the risk of psychosis in those at high risk after a year and is recommended in this group, by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Another preventative measure is to avoid drugs that have been associated with development of <b>the</b> <b>disorder,</b> including cannabis, cocaine, and amphetamines.|$|E
