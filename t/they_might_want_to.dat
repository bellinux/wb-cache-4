Around a half to two-thirds of women with SCI report <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> have children, and 14–20% do get {{pregnant}} at least once. Although female fertility is not usually permanently reduced by SCI, there is a stress response that can happen immediately post-injury that alters levels of fertility-related hormones in the body. In about half of women, menstruation stops after the injury but then returns within an average of five months—it returns within {{a year for a}} large majority. After menstruation returns, women with SCI become pregnant at a rate close to that {{of the rest of the}} population.|$|E
500|$|With Disney's backing, the {{production}} team was {{given access to}} 36 hours of Travers' audio recordings of herself, the Shermans, and co-writer Don DaGradi that were produced during the development of Mary Poppins, in addition to letters written between Disney and Travers from the 1940s through the 1960s. Richard M. Sherman also worked on the film as a music supervisor and shared his side of his experiences working with Travers on Mary Poppins. Initially, Hancock had reservations about Disney's involvement with the film, believing that the studio would edit the screenplay in their co-founder's favor. However, Marcel admitted that the studio [...] "specifically didn't {{want to come in}} and sanitize it or change Walt in any way." [...] Hancock elaborated, [...] "I was still worried that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> chip away at Walt a little bit...I thought the portrayal of Walt was fair and human so I came in and they said, ‘No, we like it.’ But still, every step of the way, I had my fist balled up behind my back ready to fight in case it happened, but it didn’t." [...] Although the filmmakers did not receive any creative interference from Disney regarding Walt Disney's depiction, the studio did request that they omit any onscreen inhalation of cigarettes due to the company's policy of not directly depicting smoking in films released under the Walt Disney Pictures banner, and to avoid receiving an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association of America. Instead, Disney is shown extinguishing a lit cigarette in one scene, and his notorious smoker's cough is heard off-screen several times throughout the film.|$|E

60|$|In June 1563 Elizabeth {{requested}} Mary {{to permit}} the return to Scotland of Lennox (the traitor to the national cause and to Cardinal Beaton, and the rival of the Hamiltons for the succession to the thrones), apparently for the very purpose of entangling Mary in a marriage with Lennox's son Darnley, and then thwarting it. (It was not Mary who asked Elizabeth to send Lennox.) Knox's favourite candidate was Lord Robert Dudley: despite his notorious character he sometimes favoured the English Puritans. When Holyrood had been invaded by a mob who, in Mary's absence in autumn 1563, broke up the Catholic attendants on Mass (such attendance, in Mary's absence, was illegal), and when both parties were summoned to trial, Knox called together the godly. The Council cleared him of the charge of making an unlawful convocation (<b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make one, any day, themselves), and he {{was supported by the}} General Assembly.

6000|$|When I came to myself, {{the first}} thing I thought was that they would ask me to hold it. Then I remembered, with another sinking at the heart, that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> call it after me. These, of course, were selfish reflections; but my {{position}} was a trying one. The question was, what was the proper {{thing for me to}} do? I told myself that my brother might come back at any moment, and all I thought of after that was what I should say to him. I had an idea that I ought to congratulate him, but it seemed a brutal thing to do. I had not made up my mind when I heard him coming down. He was laughing and joking in what seemed to me a flippant kind of way, considering the circumstances. When his hand touched the door I snatched at my book and read as hard as I could. He was swaggering a little as he entered, but the swagger went out of him as soon as his eye fell on me. I fancy he had come down to tell me, and now {{he did not know how}} to begin. He walked up and down the room restlessly, looking at me as he walked the one way, while I looked at him as he walked the other way. At length he sat down again and took up his book. He did not try to smoke. The silence was something terrible; nothing was to be heard but an occasional cinder falling from the grate. This lasted, I should say, for twenty minutes, and then he closed his book and flung it on the table. I saw that the game was up, and closed [...] "Anne Judge, Spinster." [...] Then he said, with affected jocularity: [...] "Well, young man, do you know that you are an uncle?" [...] There was silence again, for I was still trying to think out some appropriate remark. After a time I said, in a weak voice. [...] "Boy or girl?" [...] "Girl," [...] he answered. Then I thought hard again, and all at once remembered something. [...] "Both doing well?" [...] I whispered. [...] "Yes," [...] he said sternly. I felt that something great was expected of me, but I could not jump up and wring his hand. I was an uncle. I stretched out my arm toward the cigar-box, and firmly lighted my first cigar.|$|E

Now, there was Dick Lancaster; he came to me and asked me squarely about that affair. To be sure, I cut him off short, for it angered me to think that he, or anybody else, should have such an idea of me, and, besides, it was none of his business. But it should have been her business; she ought to have made it her business; and, even if the thing had stood differently, I would have told her exactly how it did stand; and then she could have said to me what she thought about it, and {{what she was going to}} do. But instead of that, she just made up her mind about me, and away went everything. Yes, sir, everything. I can't tell you the plans I had made for her and for myself, and, I may say, for Dick Lancaster.

She used to sit out here, and cut the leaves of books as she read them. I can see her little hand now as it went sliding along the edges of the pages. When she went away she left it on the bench, and I took it. And I've kept it in my pocket to take out when I sit here, and cut books with it when I have 'em. I haven't many books that ain't cut, but I've sat here and cut 'em till there wasn't any left. And then I cut a lot of old volumes of Coast Survey Reports.

50|$|Typical {{scenarios}} of a profiling approach become relevant, particularly, {{in the cases}} of the first two groups, where researchers commonly wish to combine information derived from several sources about a single query or target sequence.

Similarly, <b>they</b> <b>might</b> also <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know the likely secondary structure of the mRNA encoding the gene of interest, or whether a company sells a DNA construct containing the gene. Sequence profiling tools serve to automate and integrate the process of seeking such disparate information by rendering the process of searching several different external databases transparent to the user.|$|R
5000|$|If {{a player}} has 10 or more trumps in their hand, they can declare a single (10+), double (13+), or triple (15+) [...] "handful" [...] (poignée), right before playing their first card.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. Immigration often causes strong emotions among 'native' majority members, {{who tend to}} have firm ideas about how they <b>want</b> immigrants <b>to</b> live. For example, <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> immigrants <b>to</b> integrate, assimilate, or live segregated. <b>They</b> <b>might</b> be in favour or against immigrants keeping their cultural identity. <b>They</b> <b>might</b> seek contact with or avoid immigrants. These attitudes are called 'acculturation preferences'. To date, we know little about psychological antecedents of such acculturation preferences among 'natives'. This research will employ an experimental methodology to test potential antecedents. The effects of four variables will be assessed. These are 'perceived acculturation preferences of immigrants' (eg whether immigrants {{are perceived to be}} willing to give up their culture or not), 'prejudice against immigrants', 'identity threat' (ie perceived threats to the worldview of the 'natives'), and 'essentialism' (ie a belief that group memberships are biologically determined). Two experiments among white British university students will be conducted. The independent variables will be manipulated using different techniques. For example, to manipulate perceived acculturation preferences of immigrants, participants will be exposed to video clips of fake, pre-prepared interviews with alleged immigrants. Acculturation preferences of the interviewees will be systematically varied. The effects of the manipulations will be measured...|$|R
