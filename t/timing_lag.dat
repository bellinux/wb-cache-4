5000|$|In {{the article}} titled [...] "iDynoMiCS: {{next-generation}} individual-based modelling of biofilms", an agent-based model is presented that models the colonisation of bacteria onto a surface, {{leading to the}} formation of biofilms. The purpose of iDynoMiCS (standing for individual-based Dynamics of Microbial Communities Simulator) is to simulate the growth of populations and communities of individual microbes (small unicellular organisms such as bacteria, archaea and protists) that compete for space and resources in biofilms immersed in aquatic environments. iDynoMiCS can be used to seek to understand how individual microbial dynamics lead to emergent population- or biofilm-level properties and behaviours. Examining such formations is important in soil and river studies, dental hygiene studies, infectious disease and medical implant related infection research, and for understanding biocorrosion. An agent-based modelling paradigm was employed to make it possible to explore how each individual bacterium, of a particular species, contributes {{to the development of the}} biofilm. The initial illustration of iDynoMiCS considered how environmentally fluctuating oxygen availability affects the diversity and composition of a community of denitrifying bacteria that induce the denitrification pathway under anoxic or low oxygen conditions. The study explores the hypothesis that the existence of diverse strategies of denitrification in an environment can be explained by solely assuming that faster response incurs a higher cost. The agent-based model suggests that if metabolic pathways can be switched without cost the faster the switching the better. However, where faster switching incurs a higher cost, there is a strategy with optimal response time for any frequency of environmental fluctuations. This suggests that different types of denitrifying strategies win in different biological environments. Since this introduction the applications of iDynoMiCS continues to increase: a recent exploration of the plasmid invasion in biofilms being one example. This study explored the hypothesis that poor plasmid spread in biofilms is caused by a dependence of conjugation on the growth rate of the plasmid donor agent. Through simulation, the paper suggests that plasmid invasion into a resident biofilm is only limited when plasmid transfer depends on growth. Sensitivity analysis techniques were employed that suggests parameters relating to <b>timing</b> (<b>lag</b> before plasmid transfer between agents) and spatial reach are more important for plasmid invasion into a biofilm than the receiving agents growth rate or probability of segregational loss. Further examples that utilise iDynoMiCS continue to be published, including use of iDynoMiCS in modelling of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm with glucose substrate.|$|E

This paper examines the impact of grant assistance to Northern Ireland small firms delivered over the period 1994 - 97 by the former Local Enterprise Development Unit through its Growth Business Support Programme (GBSP).

The experimental results show that with the rail pressure increasing, fuel economy and smoke are improving, while NOx is deteriorating. However, as rail pressure very high, the improving trends of smoke and fuel economy are not obvious terribly, and even at low load condition, the economy will decline instead. With injection timing delayed, NOx is reducing while smoke and fuel economy are augmenting at the conditions of high load.

The empirical study applies individual-level data for the working-age population of the three largest cities in Sweden covering the period 1991 - 2006.

40|$|Abstract Background Fertilization restores the diploid {{state and}} begins {{the process by}} which the single-cell oocyte is {{converted}} into a polarized, multicellular organism. In the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, two of the earliest events following fertilization are secretion of the chitinous eggshell and completion of meiosis, and in this report we demonstrate that the eggshell is essential for multiple developmental events at the one-cell stage. Results We show that the GLD (Germline differentiation abnormal) - 1 -regulated hexosamine pathway enzyme, glucosamine- 6 -phosphate N-acetyltransferase (GNA) - 2, is required for synthesis of uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), the substrate for eggshell chitin synthesis by chitin synthase- 1 (CHS- 1). Furthermore, while chs- 1 (RNAi) or combined RNAi with the chitin-binding proteins, CEJ- 1 and B 0280. 5, does not interfere with normal meiotic <b>timing,</b> <b>lagging</b> chromosomes are observed at meiosis, and polar-body extrusion fails. We also demonstrate that chitin, and either CEJ- 1 or B 0280. 5, are essential for the osmotic/permeability barrier and for movement of the sperm pronucleus/centrosome complex to the cortex, which is associated with the initiation of polarization. Conclusion Our results indicate that the eggshell is required in single-cell C. elegans development, playing an essential role in multiple actin-dependent early events. Furthermore, the earliest meiotic roles precede osmotic barrier formation, indicating that the role of the eggshell is not limited to generation of the osmotic barrier. </p...|$|R
40|$|Prior {{marketing}} {{literature has}} overlooked {{the role of}} regulatory regimes in explaining international sales growth of new products. This paper addresses this gap {{in the context of}} new pharmaceuticals (15 new molecules in 34 countries) and sheds light on the effect regulatory regimes have on new drug sales across the globe. Based on a time-varying coefficient model, we find that differences in regulation substantially contribute to cross-country variation in sales. One of the regulatory constraints investigated, i. e. manufacturer price controls, has a positive effect on drug sales. The other forms of regulation such as restrictions of physician prescription budgets and the prohibition of direct-to-consumer advertising tend to hurt sales. The effect of manufacturer price controls is similar for newly launched and mature drugs. In contrast, regulations on physician prescription budget and direct-to-consumer advertising have a differential effect for newly launched and mature drugs. While the former hurts mature drugs more, the latter has a larger effect on newly launched drugs. In addition to these regulatory effects, we find that national culture, economic wealth, introduction <b>timing,</b> <b>lagged</b> sales and competition, also affect drug sales. Our findings may be used as input by managers for international launch and sales decisions. They may also be used by public policy administrators to compare drug sales in their country to other countries and to assess the role of regulatory regimes therein. economics;regulation;culture;drug;international new product growth;penalized splines;pharmaceutical;timevarying effects...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} model for the {{aperiodic}} variablity of accreting Black Hole Candidates (BHC) along with model light curves. According to the model this variability is the combined outcome of random (Poisson) injection of soft photons near the center of an extended inhomogeneous distribution of hot electrons (similar to those advocated by the ADAF or ADIOS flows) and the stochastic nature of Compton scattering which converts these soft photons into the observed high energy radiation. Thus, the <b>timing</b> properties (PSD, <b>lags,</b> coherence) of the BHC light curves reflect, to a large extent, the properties of the scattering medium (which in this approximation acts as a combination of a linear amplifier/filter) and they can be used to probe its structure, most notably the density profile of the scattering medium. The model accounts well for the observed PSDs and lags and also the reduction in the RMS variability and the increase in the characteristic PSD frequencies with increasing source luminosity.

To identify non-S-RNase sequences that are required for pollen rejection, a Nicotiana alata cDNA library was screened by differential hybridization. One clone, designated HT, hybridized strongly to RNA from N. alata styles but not to RNA from Nicotiana plumbaginifolia, a species known to lack one or more factors necessary for S-allele-specific pollen rejection. Sequence analysis revealed a 101 -residue ORF including a putative secretion signal and an asparagine-rich domain near the C terminus.

Little analysis has been done, however, to determine the specific effects of audience feedback on a performance. In this study, I have compared two performances by the same performer before very different audiences, focusing on the telling of 2 ̆ 2 Moose-Turd Pie 2 ̆ 2 (a tall tale with a joking punchline). Since the tale is told {{as part of a}} larger context, that of the relationship between performer and audience, I have discussed various components of that relationship. My comparative analysis of the two tale-tellings shows how they reflect their larger contexts. ^ My data on audience response was obtained by <b>timing</b> the <b>lag</b> time (between presented pieces and the beginning of the responses) and duration of each recorded response, by quantifying response intensities, and by categorizing the composition of the responses. ^ Each telling of the tale provides a climax to the humorous portion of the respective performance. The performer, as part of his strategic presentation of persona, then switches to other aspects of that presentation. Where this switch occurs depends on how the particular audience responds to the earlier part of the performance. Analysis of my data shows that the tale is placed where lag times and durations become most similar across performances, and where intensity has built to a climax. The performer then switches to the presentation of other aspects of his persona. Thus, I have been able to show how the strategic structuring of each performance has been affected by audience response. ^ My data also shows that there are recurrent patterned sequences of audience response throughout the performances. The structuring of these sequences reflects performance structure in general; these sequences are hierarchically related to their component stages in the same way as other features of the performance relate to their component parts. ^ During the course of the performance, performer and audience become 2 ̆ 2 conditioned 2 ̆ 2 to each other, and the performer is continuously adjusting his strategic presentation to suit the situation. The effect of audience response is clearly demonstrated through a microanalysis of the 2 ̆ 2 Moose-Turd Pie 2 ̆ 2 tale as part of its context. ...|$|R
40|$|Disruption of the {{circadian}} {{timing system}} arising from travel between time zones (“jet lag”) and rotational shift work impairs {{mental and physical}} performance and severely compromises long-term health. Circadian disruption is more severe during adaptation to advances in local time, because the circadian clock takes much longer to phase advance than delay. The recent identification of mammalian circadian clock genes now {{makes it possible to}} examine time zone adjustments from the perspective of molecular events within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the principal circadian oscillator. Current models of the clockwork posit interlocked transcriptional/posttranslational feedback loops based on the light-sensitive Period (Per) genes and the Cryptochrome (Cry) genes, which are indirectly regulated by light. We show that circadian cycles of mPer expression in the mouse SCN react rapidly to an advance in the lighting schedule, whereas rhythmic mCry 1 expression advances more slowly, in parallel to the gradual resetting of the activity–rest cycle. In contrast, during a delay in local time the mPer and mCry cycles react rapidly, completing the 6 hr shift together by the second cycle, in parallel with the activity–rest cycle. These results reveal the potential for dissociation of mPer and mCry expression within the central oscillator during circadian resetting and a differential molecular response of the clock during advance and delay resetting. They highlight the indirect photic regulation of mCry 1 as a potentially rate-limiting factor in behavioral adjustment to time zone transitions.

The overall (IDS) research plan was constructed to explore the requirements, tradeoffs assessment, and technology investigations necessary to define a Cooperative Intersection Collision Avoidance System. This report is the third report on the California PATH IDS research, and it focuses on two human factors studies which used the PATH instrumented Ford Taurus research vehicle to study driver behavior while making left turns. The goal of the first study was to observe drivers? intersection approaches and left-turn maneuvers in a mostly naturalistic setting. Twenty-three drivers (both male and female and younger and older) were recruited to drive the instrumented vehicle 10 times around an 8 -block course {{in the city of}} Berkeley, CA, making a total of 40 left turns per driver. The instrumented vehicle recorded driver actions, such as approach speed, brake activation, steering inputs, and limited estimates of oncoming vehicle gap (and lag) acceptance. The goal of the second study at the California PATH Richmond Field Station (RFS) instrumented intersection was twofold. First, left-turn gap (or lag) acceptance was examined in an environment where gaps could be more accurately measured and tightly controlled.

30|$|Ecological {{definition}} and detection of fire severity {{are influenced by}} factors of spatial resolution and timing. Resolution determines the aggregation of effects within a sampling unit or pixel (alpha variation), hence limiting the discernible ecological responses, and controlling the spatial patchiness of responses distributed throughout a burn (beta variation). As resolution decreases, alpha variation increases, extracting beta variation and complexity from the spatial model of the whole burn. Seasonal timing impacts the quality of radiometric data in terms of transmittance, sun angle, and potential contrast between responses within burns. Detection sensitivity can degrade {{toward the end of}} many fire seasons when low sun angles, vegetation senescence, incomplete burning, hazy conditions, or snow are common. Thus, a need exists to supersede many rapid response applications when remote sensing conditions improve. <b>Lag</b> <b>timing,</b> or time since fire, notably shapes the ecological character of severity through first-order effects that only emerge with time after fire, including delayed survivorship and mortality. Survivorship diminishes the detected magnitude of severity, as burned vegetation remains viable and resprouts, though at first it may appear completely charred or consumed above ground. Conversely, delayed mortality increases the severity estimate when apparently healthy vegetation is in fact damaged by heat {{to the extent that it}} dies over time. Both responses depend on fire behavior and various species-specific adaptations to fire that are unique to the pre-fire composition of each burned area. Both responses can lead initially to either over- or underestimating severity. Based on such implications, three sampling intervals for short-term burn severity are identified; rapid, initial, and extended assessment, sampled within about two weeks, two months, and depending on the ecotype, from three months to one year after fire, respectively. Spatial and temporal conditions of sampling strategies constrain data quality and ecological information obtained about fire severity. Though commonly overlooked, such considerations determine the objectives and hypotheses that are appropriate for each application, and are especially important when building comparative studies or long-term reference databases on fire severity.|$|R
40|$|Greenhouse gas {{emissions}} have altered global climate significantly, increasing {{the frequency of}} drought, fire, and pest-related mortality in forests across the western United States, with increasing area affected each year. Associated changes in forests are of great concern for the public, land managers, and the broader scientific community. These increased stresses {{have resulted in a}} widespread, spatially heterogeneous decline of forest canopies, which in turn exerts strong controls on the accumulation and melt of the snowpack, and changes forest-atmosphere exchanges of carbon, water, and energy. Most satellite-based retrievals of summer-season forest data are insufficient to quantify canopy, as opposed to the combination of canopy and undergrowth, since the signals of the two types of vegetation greenness have proven persistently difficult to distinguish. To overcome this issue, this research develops a method to quantify forest canopy cover using winter-season fractional snow covered area (FSCA) data from NASA 2 ̆ 7 s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow covered area and grain size (MODSCAG) algorithm. In areas where the ground surface and undergrowth are completely snow-covered, a pixel comprises only forest canopy and snow. Following a snowfall event, FSCA initially rises, as snow is intercepted in the canopy, and then falls, as snow unloads. A select set of local minima in a winter FSCA timeseries form a threshold where canopy is snow-free, but forest understory is snow-covered. This serves as a spatially-explicit measurement of forest canopy, and viewable gap fraction (VGF) on a yearly basis. Using this method, we determine that MODIS-observed VGF is significantly correlated with an independent product of yearly crown mortality derived from spectral analysis of Landsat imagery at 25 high-mortality sites in northern Colorado.

40|$|Jet lag has {{potentially}} serious {{deleterious effects}} on performance in athletes following transmeridian travel, where time zones are crossed eastwards or westwards; as such, travel causes specific effects related to desynchronization {{of the athletes}} internal body clock or circadian clock. Athletes are particularly sensitive {{to the effects of}} jet lag, as many intrinsic aspects of sporting performance show a circadian rhythm, and optimum competitive results require all aspects of the athletes mind and body to be working in tandem at their peak efficiency. International competition often requires transmeridian travel, and competition timings cannot be adjusted to suit individual athletes. It is therefore {{in the interest of the}} individual athlete and team to understand the effects of jet lag and the potential adaptation strategies that can be adopted. In this review, we describe the underlying genetic and physiological mechanisms controlling the circadian clock and its inherent ability to adapt to external conditions on a daily basis. We then examine the fundamentals of the various adaptation stimuli, such as light, chronobiotics (e. g. melatonin), exercise, and diet and meal timing, with particular emphasis on their suitability as strategies for competing athletes on the international circuit. These stimuli can be artificially manipulated to produce phase shifts in the circadian rhythm to promote adaptation in the optimum direction, but care must be taken to apply them at the correct time and dose, as the effects produced on the circadian rhythm follow a phase-response curve, with pronounced shifts in direction at different times. Light is the strongest realigning stimulus and careful timing of light exposure and avoidance can promote adjustment. Chronobiotics such as melatonin can also be used to realign the circadian clock but, as well as timing and dosage issues, there are also concerns as to its legal status in different countries and with the World Anti-Doping Agency. Experimental data concerning the effects of food intake and exercise <b>timing</b> on jet <b>lag</b> is limited to date in humans, and more research is required before firm guidelines can be stated. All these stimuli can also be used in pre-flight adaptation strategies to promote adjustment in the required direction, and implementation of these is described. In addition, the effects of individual variability at the behavioural and genetic levels are also discussed, along with the current limitations in assessment of these factors, and we then put forward three case studies, as examples of practical applications of these strategies, focusing on adaptations to travel involving competition in the Rugby Sevens World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Finally, we provide a list of practice points for optimal adaptation of athletes to jet lag...|$|R
40|$|Wildfires are {{a yearly}} {{recurring}} phenomenon {{in many regions}} of the world. They partially or completely remove the vegetation layer, and as such they alter ecological processes at different scale levels. Moreover, wildfires vouch for a significant emission of trace gasses in the atmosphere. The Mediterranean basin is especially sensitive to wildfire occurrence. This results from both the human pressure {{on the environment and}} the Mediterranean climate, which is characterized by dry and hot summers. Throughout time Mediterranean ecosystems have learned how to cope with fire. The classic example of a fire-adapted ecosystem is Mediterranean shrub land. Although these ecosystems respond to fire, recent research has shown an increase in fire frequency in the northern Mediterranean rim. This increase is mainly contributed to changes in land cover which are interlinked with the recent socio-economic evolution of northern Mediterranean counties. It is however, recognized, that recent climatic change also plays a role. Improved knowledge on (changing) fire regimes is of paramount importance for ecologists, resource managers and policy makers. In this context, fire/burn severity has become a parameter of increasing interest. Fire severity is defined as the degree of environmental change caused by a fire, as measured immediately post-fire. Burn severity incorporates both the direct fire impact and ecosystem responses. Due to its synoptic nature, remote sensing can provide a valuable alternative for expensive field campaigns to assess these changes. In this research three Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and multi-temporal Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images were used to assess post-fire effects of the large 2007 Peloponnese (Greece) wildfires. TM images provide spatial detail (30 m) at the cost of a 16 -day revisiting time, whereas MODIS imagery allows temporal detail as they have daily coverage, however, with a low spatial resolution of 500 m. Additionally, field data of burn severity were acquired one-year post-fire, in September 2008. The applied field protocol was the Geo Composite Burn Index (GeoCBI). The CBI is a semi-quantitative approach that combines several post-fire factors, as visually estimated in the field, into one value which is indicative for burn severity. The 2007 Peloponnese fires consumed more than 150 000 ha of agricultural land, shrub land and forest. The fires were the worst natural disaster of the last decades in Greece, both in terms of human losses and the extent of the burned area. Also, some world heritage monuments, such as Ancient Olympia, suffered severe damage. The physical basis of optical remote sensing (400 - 2400 nm) relies on the characteristic spectral signatures of terrain features. Spectral indices combine reflectance data of different wavelengths. As such they form a conceptually easy tool to estimate vegetation characteristics and their changes. The main goal of this dissertation was to evaluate the potential of these spectral indices for assessing fire/burn severity. This was done by fulfilling four objectives. Firstly, three TM spectral were correlated with field data of severity for this case study in a Mediterranean ecotype. These spectral indices were the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) and the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). The NBR yielded the best results. In addition, indices were evaluated by means of the optimality concept which considers a pixel’s pre-/post-fire trajectory in a bi-spectral feature space. Results of the optimality analysis corroborated with the outcomes of the correlation with field data indicating the NBR as the best spectral index to assess burn severity. Secondly, illumination effects on the differenced NBR (dNBR) were revealed and an illumination correction method was proposed. Scene illumination is determined by topography and solar position at the moment of image acquisition. This influences any object’s reflectance behavior and the reliability of change detection. Fire severity was more reliably detected when pixels were well illuminated and the difference in illumination between the two images was small. To overcome this problem, images should be corrected for topographical effects. The best results were obtained by applying a modified topographic correction method that, in contrast with traditional correction methods, normalizes reflectance towards a maximum illumination condition instead of normalizing towards an intermediate illumination condition. Thirdly, the importance of the role of assessment timing on a dNBR assessment was verified. Due to the limitations in Landsat available imagery, this part made use of MODIS time series. For each burned pixel a control pixel was retrieved based on time series similarity and spatial context. The control pixels estimate how burned pixels would have behaved in the case of no fire. As such the control pixel selection procedure allows a reference {{in the study of the}} temporal dimension. Differing <b>lag</b> <b>timing,</b> i. e. time since fire, of an assessment can result in significantly different dNBR statistics, especially in quickly recovering ecosystems where resprouters strongly mitigate first-order fire effects by time. Seasonal timing, on the other hand, greatly determines what is actually been measured. Inappropriate seasonal timing falsifies trends in post-fire effects. This section urges for awareness for the temporal component of dNBR studies and associated terminology. In particular, this is crucial for studies that wish to compare fires across space and time. Finally, a multi-temporal burn severity approach was presented based on MODIS time series. The method accounts for both the direct fire impact and vegetation recovery processes. The multi-temporal dNBR (dNBRMT) is defined as the one-year integrated difference between the NBR of burned pixels and their associated control pixels. As such dNBRMT estimates are indicative for the change in vegetation productivity. The multi-temporal method correlated reasonably well with the Landsat dNBR. The traditional Landsat dNBR is, however, superior for spatial detail. This traditional approach is limited by Landsat’s low revisiting time, cloud cover and image-to-image normalization constraints. The time-integrated approach, therefore, present a valuable alternative for burn severity mapping at a continental to global scale. In addition, the method has big potential to enhance comparability of burn severity across space and time. It was shown that spectral indices contain valuable information with regards to fire/burn severity. To extract a maximum degree on information, however, preconditions as illumination and assessment timing should be considered. This work can have important implications for operational dNBR mapping at a regional to global scale. It is, however, recognized that the dNBR is not a perfect proxy of fire/burn severity. Further research is required to realize the full potential of multi-spectral imagery to assess post-fire effects...|$|R
