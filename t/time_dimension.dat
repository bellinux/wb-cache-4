5|$|One notable {{feature of}} string theory and M-theory {{is that these}} {{theories}} require extra dimensions of spacetime for their mathematical consistency. In string theory, spacetime is ten-dimensional (nine spatial dimensions, and one <b>time</b> <b>dimension),</b> while in M-theory it is eleven-dimensional (ten spatial dimensions, and one <b>time</b> <b>dimension).</b> In order to describe real physical phenomena using these theories, one must therefore imagine scenarios in which these extra dimensions would not be observed in experiments.|$|E
5|$|In {{everyday}} life, {{there are}} three familiar dimensions of space: height, width and depth. Einstein's {{general theory of relativity}} treats time as a dimension on par with the three spatial dimensions; in general relativity, space and time are not modeled as separate entities but are instead unified to a four-dimensional spacetime, three spatial dimensions and one <b>time</b> <b>dimension.</b> In this framework, the phenomenon of gravity is viewed {{as a consequence of the}} geometry of spacetime.|$|E
40|$|Gravity {{cannot be}} {{quantized}} unless the quantized theory is cast on a manifold whose concomitant number of physical space dimensions {{and number of}} physical <b>time</b> <b>dimensions</b> correspond to physical reality, and not simply to the perception of reality. At present, the accepted number of physical <b>time</b> <b>dimensions</b> is dictated more by folklore than by science. In this {{paper we discuss a}} model of the early universe in which the number of physical <b>time</b> <b>dimensions</b> is four, and formulate Theorem[], which underlies an explanation of why the extra <b>time</b> <b>dimensions</b> do not source unphysical effects. In this paper we describe a new model of gravitational inflation that is driven by dark energy and "mediated" by a real massless scalar inflaton field φ whose potential is identically equal to zero. The coupled Einstein gravitational and inflaton field equations are formulated on an eight-dimensional spacetime manifold of four space <b>dimensions</b> and four <b>time</b> <b>dimensions.</b> We find explicit solutions to these field equations that exhibit temporal exponential deflation of three of the four <b>time</b> <b>dimensions,</b> and then study the dynamics of a massive complex scalar field ψ that propagates on the background ground state Einstein gravitational field to determine whether its quantum fluctuations δψ are stable or unstable. We compute explicit approximate solutions to the δψ field equations that are stable, meaning that the quantum fluctuations δψ of the field ψ do not grow exponentially with time. Instabilities driven by the momenta associated to the three extra <b>time</b> <b>dimensions</b> do not appear in the physical solutions of the field equations of this model. Comment: This revision includes a THEOREM that guarantees the existence of stable solutions to the scalar field equation when the spacetime has extra <b>time</b> <b>dimensions.</b> Previous Changes=[1] included numerical solution examples; [2] extended derivations provided for several important results; [3] explained reheatin...|$|R

5|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the quantum aspects of gravity in our four-dimensional universe, some physicists have considered a lower-dimensional mathematical model in which spacetime has only two spatial dimensions and one <b>time</b> <b>dimension.</b> In this setting, the mathematics describing the gravitational field simplifies drastically, and one can study quantum gravity using familiar methods from quantum field theory, eliminating the need for string theory or other more radical approaches to quantum gravity in four dimensions.|$|E

40|$|An {{analogy with}} real Clifford algebras on even-dimensional vector spaces {{suggests}} to assign {{a couple of}} space and <b>time</b> <b>dimensions</b> modulo 8 to any algebra (represented over a complex Hilbert space) containing two self-adjoint involutions and an anti-unitary operator with specific commutation relations. It is shown that this assignment {{is compatible with the}} tensor product: the space and <b>time</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the tensor product are the sums of the space and <b>time</b> <b>dimensions</b> of its factors. This could provide an interpretation of the presence of such algebras in PT-symmetric Hamiltonians or the description of topological matter. This construction is used to build an indefinite (i. e. pseudo-Riemannian) version of the spectral triples of noncommutative geometry, defined over Krein spaces instead of Hilbert spaces. Within this framework, we can express the Lagrangian (both bosonic and fermionic) of a Lorentzian almost-commutative spectral triple. We exhibit a space of physical states that solves the fermion-doubling problem. The example of quantum electrodynamics is described. Comment: 10 page...|$|R

500|$|To {{understand}} Einstein's equations as partial differential equations, it {{is helpful}} to formulate {{them in a way that}} describes the evolution of the universe over time. This is done in [...] "3+1" [...] formulations, where spacetime is split into three space dimensions and one <b>time</b> <b>dimension.</b> The best-known example is the ADM formalism. These decompositions show that the spacetime evolution equations of general relativity are well-behaved: solutions always exist, and are uniquely defined, once suitable initial conditions have been specified. Such formulations of Einstein's field equations are the basis of numerical relativity.|$|E
