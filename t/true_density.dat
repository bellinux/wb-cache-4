The microcrystalline starch was recovered from the reaction mixture by precipitation using ethanol. The bulk, tapped and <b>true</b> <b>densities</b> were determined.

This difference is due to angular response characteristics of the radiometer, solid angle effects due to geometry, and angular reflectance effects of the earth-atmosphere system. All of these effects lead to uncertainties in the interpretation of instantaneous earth radiation budget measurements. The differences between the <b>true</b> flux <b>density</b> and the measured flux density are shown to be significant when the field of view of the radiometer is large and when the atmosphere has a nonuniform, or spatially dependent, reflectance (albedo).
