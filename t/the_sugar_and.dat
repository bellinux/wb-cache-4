5|$|Boxing was {{introduced}} and practiced in a clandestine manner in Puerto Rico while the archipelago {{was still a}} Spanish colony. Fights were organized in haciendas among the workers of <b>the</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>and</b> coffee plantations, and the objective {{was to determine the}} best fighter among the employees. Following the culmination of the Puerto Rican Campaign and Spanish–American War, American soldiers who were stationed in the main island practiced the sport. During World War I, a championship known as Campeonato Las Casas was held as training for military personnel. Nero Chen, the first Puerto Rican boxer to gain recognition, began his career in these tournaments. The Combat Maneuver Training Center followed this example and organized boxing activities, which they named Los Campeones del Campamento. These were received with enthusiasm by the young recruits. Most of these events were celebrated without restriction due to military jurisdictional limits, although prohibitions were put in place for the civilian population. Illegal matches were organized on the rooftops of residences in Old San Juan, empty terrain's in El Condado and in hippodromes.|$|E
5|$|The termite gut has {{inspired}} various research efforts aimed at replacing fossil fuels with cleaner, renewable energy sources. Termites are efficient bioreactors, {{capable of producing}} two litres of hydrogen from a single sheet of paper. Approximately 200 species of microbes live inside the termite hindgut, releasing the hydrogen that was trapped inside wood and plants that they digest. Through the action of unidentified enzymes in the termite gut, lignocellulose polymers are broken down into sugars and are transformed into hydrogen. The bacteria within the gut turns <b>the</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>and</b> hydrogen into cellulose acetate, an acetate ester of cellulose on which termites rely for energy. Community DNA sequencing of the microbes in the termite hindgut has been employed to provide {{a better understanding of}} the metabolic pathway. Genetic engineering may enable hydrogen to be generated in bioreactors from woody biomass.|$|E

25|$|In Yucatán, then an {{independent}} republic north of Guatemala, a war started between the natives and criollo people; this war seemed {{rooted in the}} defense of communal lands against the expansion of private ownership, which was accentuated by the boom in the production of henequen, which was an important industrial fiber used to make rope. After discovering the value of the plant, the wealthier Yucateco criollos started plantations, beginning in 1833, to cultivate it on a large scale; not long after the henequen boom, a boom in sugar production led to more wealth. <b>The</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>and</b> henequen plantations encroached on native communal land, and native workers recruited to work on the plantations were mistreated and underpaid.|$|E
25|$|Before the United States officially {{took over}} the government, it had already begun cutting tariffs on American goods {{entering}} Cuba, without granting the same rights to Cuban goods going to the United States.

In spite of the Foraker Amendment, which prohibited the U.S. occupation government from granting privileges and concessions to American investors, the Cuban economy was soon dominated by American capital. The growth of American sugar estates was so quick that in 1905 nearly 10% of Cuba's total land area belonged to American citizens. By 1902, American companies controlled 80% of Cuba's ore exports and owned most of <b>the</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>and</b> cigarette factories.|$|E

25|$|During {{the reign}} of King Louis XIV, his {{personal}} physician Guy-Crescent Fagon recommended that he drink only wines from Nuits St-Georges for their health giving properties. Wine merchants in the Côte de Nuits latched onto this royal association as a great marketing coup over the region's rivals in Champagne and Bordeaux. The 18th century ushered {{in a period of}} tête de cuvée of wines made solely from the best grapes produced in single vineyards. To add to the distinctiveness of these wines, new winemaking techniques such as extended maceration and longer fermentations became popular. This produced dark, tannic vin de garde wines that required extended periods of aging. Imitation of this style by producers using lower quality of grapes saw producers use various methods of adulteration such as adding honey to the wine in order to increase <b>the</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>and,</b> consequently, the alcohol level of the wine. Following Jean-Antoine Chaptal's, Napoleon's Minister of the Interior, recommendation to use the method now known as chaptalization to boost alcohol levels, the market was flooded with Burgundy wines from the Côte de Nuits and beyond that were dark, dense and highly alcoholic.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{recognizing}} how {{crony capitalism}} weakened the economy due to collusion {{between government and}} big business and adhering to the Catholic social principle of subsidiarity, President Aquino {{set out on a}} course of market liberalization agenda {{while at the same time}} emphasizing solidarity, people empowerment and civic engagement to help alleviate poverty in the country. The Aquino administration also sought to bring back fiscal discipline in order as it aimed to trim down the government's budget deficit that ballooned during Marcos' term through privatization of bad government assets and deregulation of many vital industries. As president, Aquino sought out to dismantle the cartels, monopolies and oligopolies of important industries that were set up by Marcos cronies during the dark days of Martial Law, particularly in <b>the</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>and</b> coconut industries. By discarding these monopolies and allowing market-led prices and competition, small farmers and producers were given a fair chance to sell their produce and products at a more reasonable, competitive and profitable price. This, in a way, also helped a lot in improving the lot of farmers who are in dire need of increasing their personal income and earnings. It was also during Aquino's time that vital economic laws such as the Built-Operate-Transfer Law, Foreign Investments Act and the Consumer Protection and Welfare Act were enacted.|$|E
500|$|... "Mother Knows Best" [...] has {{garnered}} universal acclaim {{from both}} film and music critics, several of whom admitted to enjoying the song despite being unimpressed {{with the majority}} of Tangleds music. Writing for The Blade, Kirk Baird opined that most of the film's songs [...] "aren't particularly memorable" [...] except for [...] "Mother Knows Best". Likewise, Lindsey Ward of Canoe.ca wrote, [...] "the musical numbers aren't the best things in Tangled -- the exception being 'Mother Knows Best', a brash track that scene-stealing Tony-winner Murphy alone turns into a giant spectacle with her voice". Acknowledging that [...] "The songs ... don't sound on first hearing like top-drawer Menken", Richard Corliss of Time described [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] as [...] "a pot of poisoned honey." [...] Similarly, Anthony Quinn of The Independent wrote, [...] "The songs are no great shakes ... apart from 'Mother Knows Best'." [...] Michael Smith, writing for the Tulsa World, felt that the song's darkness [...] "remind of the nasty bits of the original Grimm's fairy tale and give Tangled a bitter balance for <b>the</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>and</b> spice moments." [...] Mal Vincent of The Virginian-Pilot described the song as [...] "a good villain entry." [...] Critics have continuously cited [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] as the film's best song. The Scotsman hailed it as Tangleds [...] "finest song." [...] Similarly, Nigel Andrews of the Financial Times acknowledged [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] as one of Tangleds [...] "best tunes," [...] while Georgie Hobbs of Little White Lies identified it as the film's [...] "standout", deeming it [...] "worthy of the very best of [...] Sondheim's crazed heroines."

[...] In 1630, the Dutch occupied the Portuguese sugar-settlement of Pernambuco {{and over the next}} few years pushed inland, annexing the sugar plantations that surrounded it. [...] In order to supply the plantations with the manpower they required, a successful expedition was launched in 1637 from Brazil to capture the Portuguese slaving post of Elmina, and in 1641 successfully captured the Portuguese settlements in Angola.
