5|$|The {{left and}} right sides of the brain appear symmetrical, but they {{function}} asymmetrically. For example, the counterpart of the left-hemisphere motor area controlling the right hand is the right-hemisphere area controlling the left hand. There are, however, several important exceptions, involving language and spatial cognition. The left frontal lobe is dominant for language. If a key language area in the left hemisphere is damaged, it can leave the victim unable to speak or understand, whereas equivalent damage to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> would cause only minor impairment to language skills.|$|E
25|$|Although hemispatial neglect {{has been}} {{identified}} following left hemisphere damage (resulting in the neglect of {{the right side of}} space), it is most common after damage to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> This disparity is thought to reflect the fact that <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> of the brain is specialized for spatial perception and memory, whereas the left hemisphere is specialized for language - there is redundant processing of the right visual fields by both hemispheres. Hence <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> is able to compensate for the loss of left hemisphere function, but not vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Most {{language}} {{production and}} processing {{occur in the}} left hemisphere {{while the majority of}} the emotional processing and production of emotion in speech occurs in <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> Schizophrenic patients usually have difficulty processing prosody. These patients also show a remarkable increase in lateralization towards <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> of both emotionally and non-emotional prosody rich speech. Also, a decrease in right-handedness led to an increase in <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> lateralization. This right hemisphere lateralization extends beyond prosody to many of aspects of language and speech processing in schizophrenic patients.|$|E

25|$|Rossi (1977) {{suggests}} that the function and characteristic between left and right cerebral hemispheres may enable us to locate the archetypes in the right cerebral hemisphere. He cites research indicating that left hemispherical functioning is primarily verbal and associational, {{and that of the}} right primarily visuospatial and apperceptive. Thus the left hemisphere is equipped as a critical, analytical, information processor while <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> operates in a 'gestalt' mode. This means that <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> is better at getting a picture of a whole from a fragment, is better at working with confused material, is more irrational than the left, and more closely connected to bodily processes. Once expressed in the form of words, concepts and language of the ego's left hemispheric realm, however, they become only representations that 'take their colour' from the individual consciousness. Inner figures such as shadow, anima and animus would be archetypal processes having source in <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere.</b>|$|E

50|$|Amorphosynthesis, {{also called}} a hemi-sensory deficit, is a neuropsychological {{condition}} in which a patient experiences unilateral inattention to sensory input. This phenomenon is frequently associated with damage to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> cerebral <b>hemisphere</b> resulting in severe sensory deficits that are observed on the contralesional (left) side of the body. A right-sided deficit is less commonly observed and the effects are reported to be temporary and minor. Evidence suggests that <b>the</b> <b>right</b> cerebral <b>hemisphere</b> has a dominant role in attention and awareness to somatic sensations through ipsilateral and contralateral stimulation. In contrast, the left cerebral hemisphere is activated only by contralateral stimuli. Thus, <b>the</b> left and <b>right</b> cerebral <b>hemispheres</b> exhibit redundant processing to the right-side {{of the body and}} a lesion to the left cerebral hemisphere can be compensated by the ipsiversive processes of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> cerebral <b>hemisphere.</b> For this reason, right-sided amorphosynthesis is less often observed and is generally associated with bilateral lesions.|$|R
25|$|Genie's {{language}} acquisition also refined existing hypotheses and {{gave rise to}} additional hypotheses about what parts of language <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> could acquire after the critical period. Throughout {{the course of her}} linguistic development her language had remained largely congruous with adult split-brain and left hemispherectomy patients. By contrast, in both previous and subsequent studies, people with the same conditions who began acquiring language in their right hemispheres prior {{to the end of the}} critical period had developed normal vocabulary and grammar. This further convinced the scientists that Genie's {{language acquisition}} was abnormal because she had started after the critical period, and therefore was processing language in <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> of her brain.|$|E
25|$|Right-handed {{people would}} {{normally}} choose {{to move their}} right hand 60% of the time, but when <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> was stimulated they would instead choose their left hand 80% of the time (recall that <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> of the brain {{is responsible for the}} left side of the body, and the left hemisphere for the right). Despite the external influence on their decision-making, the subjects continued to report that they believed their choice of hand had been made freely. In a follow-up experiment, Alvaro Pascual-Leone and colleagues found similar results, but also noted that the transcranial magnetic stimulation must occur within 200 milliseconds, consistent with the time-course derived from the Libet experiments.|$|E
25|$|Early {{studies showed}} {{evidence}} {{that there may be}} an interhemispheric transfer deficit among people with alexithymia; that is, the emotional information from <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> of the brain is not being properly transferred to the language regions in the left hemisphere, as can be caused by a decreased corpus callosum, often present in psychiatric patients who have suffered severe childhood abuse. A neuropsychological study in 1997 indicated that alexithymia may be due to a disturbance to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> of the brain, which is largely responsible for processing emotions. In addition, another neuropsychological model suggests that alexithymia may be related to a dysfunction of the anterior cingulate cortex. These studies have some shortcomings, however, and the empirical evidence about the neural mechanisms behind alexithymia remains inconclusive.|$|E

25|$|Substantial {{damage to}} tissue {{anywhere}} {{within the region}} shown in blue on the figure below can potentially result in aphasia. Aphasia can also sometimes be caused by damage to subcortical structures deep within the left hemisphere, including the thalamus, {{the internal and external}} capsules, and the caudate nucleus of the basal ganglia. The area and extent of brain damage or atrophy will determine the type of aphasia and its symptoms. A very small number of people can experience aphasia after damage to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> only.

25|$|Based {{on these}} results, Bellugi and Klima {{believed}} that Genie had been developing {{as a typical}} right-handed person until the time her father began isolating her. They attributed the imbalance between Genie's hemispheres {{to the fact that}} Genie's sensory input as a child was almost exclusively visual and tactile, stimulating functions which are predominantly controlled in <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> of a right-handed person, and although this input had been extremely minimal it was sufficient to cause their lateralization to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> They therefore believed that because Genie had no linguistic input during her childhood, it underwent no specialization whatsoever and as a result her language functions never lateralized to it. Since Genie accurately distinguished speech sounds with her right hemisphere, they thought her language functions had lateralized there instead.|$|E

40|$|Background/Aim. Both {{superior}} parietal lobule (SPL) of dorsolateral hemispheric {{surface and}} precuneus (PEC) of medial surface are {{the parts of}} posterior parietal cortex. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the numerical density (NV) of pyramidal neurons in the layer V of SPL and PEC and their potential differences. Methods. From 20 (40 hemispheres) formaline fixed human brains (both sexes; 27 - 65 years) tissue blocks from SPL and PEC from <b>the</b> left and <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> were used. According to their size the brains were divided into two groups, the group I with the larger left (15 brains) and the group II with <b>the</b> larger <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> (5 brains). Serial Nissl sections (5 μm) of <b>the</b> left and <b>right</b> SPL and PEC were used for stereological estimation of NV of the layer V pyramidal neurons. Results. NV of pyramidal neurons in the layer V in the left SPL of brains with larger left hemispheres was significantly higher than in the left SPL of brains with larger <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> Comparing sides in brains with larger left hemisphere, the left SPL had higher NV than <b>the</b> <b>right</b> one, and then the left PEC, and <b>the</b> <b>right</b> SPL had significantly higher NV than <b>the</b> <b>right</b> PEC. Comparing sides in brains with <b>the</b> larger <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere,</b> <b>the</b> left SPL had significantly higher NV than left PEC, but <b>the</b> <b>right</b> SPL had significantly higher NV than left SPL and <b>the</b> <b>right</b> PEC. Conclusion. Generally, there is an inverse relationship of NV between the medial and lateral areas of the human posterior parietal cortex. The obtained values were different between the brains with larger left and <b>right</b> <b>hemispheres,</b> as well as between the SPL and PEC.
