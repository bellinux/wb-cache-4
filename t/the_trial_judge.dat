5|$|Dietrich's other {{argument}} was that <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> should have used discretionary powers and granted an adjournment until Dietrich {{was able to}} provide counsel himself, and that the {{failure to do so}} caused a miscarriage of justice. Dietrich had asked <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> for an adjournment during the trial, but the judge said that since more than a year had passed since the offence occurred, it was {{in the interests of the}} community that the matter be dealt with promptly.|$|E
5|$|If <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> erroneously {{permits the}} {{striking}} of a juror under Batson, and the error is preserved, the only remedy is automatic reversal. If <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> erroneously prevents the striking of a juror under Batson, and the juror is seated, the Constitution permits a jurisdiction to utilize harmless error analysis. The {{race of the}} defendant is irrelevant to a Batson claim. Batson also permits the prosecutor to challenge defense peremptory strikes ("reverse Batson"). And, Batson applies equally to race and gender.|$|E
5|$|The court {{concluded}} that <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> had erred in not exercising his discretion to bar {{the evidence from}} being admitted, {{although it was not}} necessary to decide the point.|$|E
50|$|Upon appeal by {{the federal}} {{government}} to the British Columbia Court of Appeal, the majority of the court affirmed <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>judge's</b> decision, agreeing with the result of <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>judge's</b> Charter and interjurisdictional immunity analyses.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> has an {{obligation}} to ensure an impartial jury, especially vis-a-vis juror biases and media coverage by such means as jury selection (including voir dire and for-cause challenges), jury sequestration, and jury instructions. For example, this may require the court to permit voir dire {{on the subject of the}} juror's potential racial prejudice. In some circumstances, the Sixth Amendment even requires <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> to grant a defendant's change of venue motion if an impartial jury cannot be obtained otherwise.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>trial</b> <b>judge,</b> {{over the}} prior {{objection}} of Glasser, appointed Stewart to represent Kretske. Stewart represented both Glasser and Kretske throughout the proceeding. Glasser {{did not raise}} the issue again until the appeal was filed.|$|E

5|$|On August 6, 1981, Ray Taylor {{was arrested}} {{for the murder of}} Jack Bridges in a fight in Chicago. In advance of the trial, the {{prosecutor}} submitted a request for all the defense witnesses in the case. The defense attorney for Taylor provided a list of four individuals, which did not include witnesses Alfred Wormley and Pam Berkhalter. When the defendant tried to introduce these witnesses {{on the second day of}} the trial, <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> sanctioned the defense for failing to put the witness names on the original list provided to the prosecution. Therefore, it ruled the two unlisted witnesses would not be allowed to testify. <b>The</b> <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> was specifically frustrated that the witness, Wormley, was known to the defense prior to trial, but was hidden away from the prosecution.|$|E
5|$|In March 1979 at Stafford Crown Court {{he pleaded}} not guilty to murder but instead pleaded guilty to {{manslaughter}} on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The plea was accepted by the prosecution, after psychiatrists gave evidence that he had an active paranoid psychosis. His indefinite detention was ordered by <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>judge,</b> Mr Justice Stephen Brown, and he was held in Broadmoor Hospital and at Ashworth Hospital, both high security units.|$|E
5|$|In a {{unanimous}} decision, the three judges {{decided that the}} appeal should be allowed (more specifically, that leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal heard and allowed instanter– at once), {{on the basis that}} the 8March 2003 interview was not voluntary and so was inadmissible, and by admitting it <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> had made an error of law resulting in a miscarriage of justice.|$|E
50|$|They {{therefore}} {{concluded that}} <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>judged</b> erred in his {{instructions to the}} jury.|$|R

50|$|Beamish {{appealed to}} the Court of Criminal Appeal {{on the grounds that}} <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>judge's</b> {{directions}} were in error, and his confession was involuntary and therefore should have been ruled inadmissible or excluded in <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>judge's</b> discretion. <b>The</b> appeal was dismissed on 20 October 1961 and an application for leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia was dismissed on 11 December 1961.|$|R
5|$|Taw {{appealed to}} the High Court against his {{conviction}} on two main grounds. The first involved the admissibility of evidence for his corruption, and, additionally, inconsistencies of such evidence. The second concerned constitutional issues. With regard to the evidential issue, the Court held that <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> made an error in accepting GIC's statements as admissible, and thus ordered Taw's convictions to be set aside.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> also {{concluded}} that Thomas had been properly informed {{of his right}} to silence, and had not been induced by the AFP officers {{to participate in the}} interview by offer of repatriation or any other reward. Ultimately he decided that Thomas had participated voluntarily in the interview, and that in the circumstances, Thomas' lack of legal advice should not make the record of the interview inadmissible.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> had {{criticized the}} police investigation, Essex Police held an {{internal}} inquiry, conducted by Detective Chief Superintendent Dickinson. Bamber alleged this report confirmed that evidence had been withheld by the police, {{so he made}} a formal complaint, which was investigated in 1991 by the City of London Police. This process uncovered more documentation, which Bamber used to petition the Home Secretary in September 1993 for a referral back to the Court of Appeal, refused in July 1994.|$|E

5|$|In Malaysian Bar v. Government of Malaysia (1987), the Supreme Court of Malaysia {{referred}} to the strict scrutiny approach but asserted that in reality it was not {{very different from the}} traditional rational nexus standard, which it then proceeded to apply. The Court's endorsement of strict scrutiny was much less ambiguous in Government of Malaysia v. V.R. Menon (1990). It held that the impugned Act was concerned with economic and social welfare and not fundamental rights, and therefore <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> had erred in applying a stricter standard of review. As such, the court implicitly endorsed the application of the strict scrutiny test in cases concerning fundamental rights in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} first {{heard in the}} District Court. The appellants contended {{by way of a}} {{preliminary}} objection that Order 123 was ultra vires, or beyond the powers, of the UPA and contravened Article 15(1) of the Constitution of Singapore, which enshrines the right to freedom of religion. <b>The</b> <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> dismissed the preliminary objection, holding that Order 123 was valid and constitutional, as the order concerned the public interest and was permitted under s 3(1) of the UPA. Accordingly, the appellants were convicted for possession of the banned publications. They appealed to the High Court against the trial judge's decision.|$|E
5|$|The {{defendants}} argued: (1) {{that the}} indictment {{should have been}} quashed because {{of the absence of}} women from the grand jury; (2) that the indictment was not returned in open court; (3) that the indictment was duplicitous, inconsistent, and vague; (4) that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict; (5) that <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> should have granted a continuance, rather than appoint Stewart to represent Kretske; (6) that Roth should have been severed from the other defendants; (7) that the reports of the Alcohol Tax Unit were hearsay; (7) that the two government exhibits not admitted into evidence were sent to the jury during its deliberations; (8) that Glasser had been cross-examined on matters not pertinent to the charge and not within the scope of his direct examination; (9) that the cross-examination of U.S. Attorney Campbell had been unduly restricted; (10) that evidence beyond the scope of the bill of particulars had been introduced; (11) that there was insufficient corroboration of the accomplice testimony against Kretske; (12) that certain testimony of Alexander Campbell was erroneously admitted; (13) that the admission of various prejudicial evidence had the cumulative effect of denying the defendants a fair trial; (14) that the trial judge's cross-examination of witnesses and other comments crossed the line into advocacy; and (15) that <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> should have granted a new trial because of the exclusion of women from the jury pool.|$|E

5|$|Amid loud outcry, Playford {{started a}} Royal Commission {{to review the}} case. However, two of the Commissioners appointed, Chief Justice Mellis Napier and Justice Geoffrey Reed, had already been involved, Napier as {{presiding}} judge in the Full Court appeal and Reed as <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>judge.</b> This provoked worldwide controversy with claims of bias {{from the likes of}} the President of the Indian Bar Council, the esteemed British judge Norman Birkett, the leader of the United Kingdom Liberal Party Jo Grimond and former British Prime Minister Clement Attlee. Years later, Playford admitted that he erred in his appointments of Reed and Napier and that it could have shaken public confidence on the fairness of the hearing.|$|E
5|$|Carol Park {{went missing}} on 17 July 1976, {{and was never}} seen alive again by her family. In 1997, her body was {{discovered}} by divers in Coniston Water and Gordon was arrested on suspicion of murder. Reputedly he said 'oh dear', after being informed they had found her body. The charges were subsequently dropped but in 2004 Gordon was arrested again and found guilty of his wife's murder. <b>The</b> <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> sentenced him to life imprisonment and recommended that he should serve a minimum of 15 years before being considered for parole. He was held at Garth prison, Leyland, Preston. In December 2007 he lodged an appeal against his conviction which was dismissed in November 2008. On 25 January 2010, he was found hanged in his cell, and pronounced dead at the scene.|$|E
5|$|The State of California charged Alvarado and {{his friend}} with first-degree murder and {{attempted}} robbery. Alvarado attempted to suppress his statements given during the Comstock interview {{on the basis that}} he was not read his Miranda rights. The trial court denied the motion on the basis that Alvarado was not in police custody at the time he gave his statement. Alvarado was subsequently convicted, primarily based on statements Alvarado made during his police interrogation. Alvarado's conviction was reduced by <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> to second-degree murder for his comparatively minor role in the offense. The California Courts of Appeal affirmed the conviction and agreed that Alvarado was not in custody. The Supreme Court of California declined discretionary review.|$|E
