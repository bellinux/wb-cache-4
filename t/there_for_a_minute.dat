500|$|One {{formality}} left were New York's late-in-the-season primary {{elections on}} September 12, {{which in this}} case merely served to ratify the state party conventions' choices. [...] Lazio won unopposed, while Clinton won 82percent of the vote in easily defeating unknown Manhattan doctor Mark McMahon, who ran on the grounds that [...] "the Clintons have tried to hijack the Democratic Party." [...] For her part, Clinton said that she was [...] "surprised, in a way [...] I stood <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> staring at my name." [...] In any case, the general election was already well underway.|$|E
60|$|MALISE. Will {{you go in}} <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute?</b> Or {{shall we}} let them ring--or--what? It may not be anything, of course.|$|E
6000|$|She {{laid her}} right hand gently on the Doctor's head, and kept it <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or so. [...] "Are you at rest now?" [...] she asked.|$|E
60|$|MORE. Do {{you imagine}} I think myself {{better than the}} humblest private {{fighting}} out <b>there?</b> Not <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Supposing we step in <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes,</b> {{while you}} and Mr. Passmore meet Mr. Haskers," [...] he cried. [...] "We'll come {{out when you}} say so." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> {{was silence}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two, and then Ida spoke again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, look here, sonny, {{stand right}} <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> will you, while I go out? I won't be gone a great while, an' you can finish up your breakfast." ...|$|E
60|$|As he ceased {{speaking}} the doctor moved quietly {{up to the}} side of the stretcher, put his finger on his wrist, and stood <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> then he bent down and listened.|$|E
60|$|I {{stood there}} looking at 'im, but he couldn't meet my eye. None of 'em could; and arter waiting <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two to give 'em a chance, I turned my back on 'em {{and went off to}} my dooty.|$|E
60|$|<b>There</b> {{was silence}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two, and then Mr. Richards said.|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> {{was silence}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two; and then Mark began again.|$|R
60|$|The latter {{had nearly}} reached the yard, {{when the two}} balls of fire began to roll along it, joined in the centre, and then slowly ascended the topmast. The fireballs paused <b>there</b> <b>for</b> half <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> and then vanished.|$|R
60|$|He stood <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> very sorrowful, {{and then}} 'e patted both their 'eads and went downstairs. Ginger and Peter lay {{listening}} for a bit, {{and then they}} turned their pore bound-up faces {{to each other and}} tried to talk with their eyes.|$|E
60|$|At last, but one man {{remained}} standing <b>there.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> he stood quietly immovable, then fell forward dead. Then the Dervishes lost heart, {{and began to}} fall back in ones and twos, then in dozens, until the last had disappeared behind the hills.|$|E
6000|$|... "I left 'im <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> while I {{went and}} 'ad a look round. The {{deck of the}} Snipe was empty, but I could 'ear Uncle Dick down in the cabin singing; and, arter {{listening}} {{for a few seconds}} {{to make sure that it}} was singing, I went back and beckoned to 'Arry.|$|E
60|$|David {{had stood}} <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> like <b>a</b> man stunned. Then {{he had turned}} and walked away up the lane under the birches. He said nothing--then or at any other time. From that day no {{reference}} to his wife or her concerns ever crossed his lips.|$|R
5000|$|... 19 February: CIA staffers, {{including}} Plame, meet {{to discuss}} sending Wilson to Niger. According to Plame, she is <b>there</b> only <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{next time}} the moon came out a vessel was clearly seen. The {{smuggler}} raised the lantern above the bulwarks, held it <b>there</b> <b>for</b> half <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> and then lowered it. This he repeated three times. A moment later a similar signal was made on the bows of the vessel.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sam {{took the}} 'ankercher and thanked 'em very perlite, and arter {{standing}} <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two {{as if they}} wanted to say something they couldn't remember, they sheered off. When Sam left the place 'arf-an- hour afterwards they was still hanging about, and as Sam passed Ginger asked 'im if he was going for a walk.|$|E
6000|$|... "Willie {{was sure}} dandy-looking in his uniform, with medals strung on his breast {{and his new}} gold-handled sword. You'd never have taken him for the little white-headed snipe that the girls used to order about and make fun of. He just stood <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> looking at Myra with a {{peculiar}} little smile on his face; {{and then he says}} to her, slow, and kind of holding on to his words with his teeth: ...|$|E
60|$|For {{the most}} part all was very quiet, but {{sometimes}} there were noises that jarred Marston's nerves. Although the night was calm, leaves rustled {{in the dark and}} one heard sounds like the stealthy tread of naked feet. Marston fancied shadows lurked about the edge of the beam from the door and found it hard to persuade himself he was deceived, although he knew nobody was <b>there.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two moisture splashed outside, as if somebody had struck a branch and shaken down big drops. The noise stopped and Marston felt the silence worse.|$|E
6000|$|<b>There</b> {{was silence}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two, till Mrs. Davilow said, while coiling the daughter's hair, [...] "I am sure I have never crossed you, Gwendolen." ...|$|R
60|$|Then <b>there</b> was, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two, <b>a</b> {{silence that}} both found almost {{intolerable}} and that seemed emphasized by the snapping of the fire. There {{was before the}} girl a task from which she shrank, {{but it was clear}} to her that, since she could not let him go, one of them must speak.|$|R
60|$|Harry made no answer, {{and except}} for the barking of the dog <b>there</b> was silence <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two. It was Frank at last who broke it.|$|R
60|$|The Baron lay {{silent for}} a long time. At last he passed his hands over his face and held them <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> then of a sudden, before anyone knew what he was about to do, he rose upon his elbow and then sat upright upon the bed. The green wound broke out afresh and a dark red spot grew and spread upon the linen wrappings; his face was drawn and haggard with the pain of his moving, and his eyes wild and bloodshot. Great drops of sweat {{gathered}} and stood upon his forehead as he sat there swaying slightly from side to side.|$|E
60|$|Outside {{the wind}} was {{thrashing}} the broad, leafy top of the maple whose tallest twigs reached to the funny grey eaves of our old house. One roly-poly little sparrow blew or flew to the sill and sat <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> {{looking at me with}} knowing eyes. Down below I could see Murray {{in a corner of the}} yard, pottering over a sick duck. He had set its broken leg and was nursing it back to health. Anyone except Uncle Abimelech could see that Murray was simply born to be a doctor and that it was flying in the face of Providence to think of making him anything else.|$|E
60|$|In {{another minute}} {{the boat was}} rowed to the channel, and the cask lowered over the side. It was held <b>there,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> while the mate struck a light and applied it to the touch paper. Then he pressed the bung firmly {{into the top of}} the tube, the {{lashings}} of the cask were cut, and the boat rowed back to the ship. The anchors were already on board, and the brig was getting way on her as the boat rowed alongside. The men jumped on board, and the boat was suffered to tow behind, while all hands set the whole of the sails. The vessel was soon running briskly before the land breeze.|$|E
6000|$|<b>There</b> {{was silence}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> {{or two after}} Agatha had spoken, and then Father Lucien said, [...] "Now we know what Driscoll looked for. Few secrets can be kept." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Adela!" [...] {{said the}} young vicar. And now his walk {{had brought him}} to the further end of the table; and <b>there</b> he {{remained}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two. [...] "Adela!" ...|$|R
60|$|Roger Carbury did {{not take}} a single day,--or a single hour to answer the letter. He {{received}} it at breakfast, and after rushing out on the terrace and walking <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes,</b> he hurried to his desk and wrote his reply. As he did so, his whole face was red with wrath, {{and his eyes were}} glowing with indignation.|$|R
60|$|In {{the case}} of any other visitor, I should have allowed myself to be {{discovered}} in the drawing-room. There would have been {{nothing out of the}} common in my having got tired of the library, and having gone upstairs for a change. But my own self-respect stood in the way of my meeting the person who had insulted me by sending me back my books. I slipped into the little third room, which I have mentioned as communicating with the back drawing-room, and dropped the curtains which closed the open doorway. If I only waited <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two, the usual result in such cases would take place. That is to say, the doctor would be conducted to his patient's room.|$|E
6000|$|... "Soon after {{daylight}} Nelson came on deck. I {{see him as}} {{plain as}} if he was before me at this moment, for, bein' stationed in the mizzen-top o' the Victory--that was Nelson's ship, you know--I could see everything quite plain. He stood <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or so, with his admiral's frock-coat covered with orders on the left breast, and his empty right sleeve fastened up to it; for you must know he had lost his right arm in action before that, and also his right eye, but the arm and eye that were left were quite enough for him to work with. After a word or two with the officers, he signalled to bear down on the enemy in two lines.|$|E
6000|$|When {{the case}} had been {{disposed}} of, and the students dismissed, I went straight into the laboratory {{to get a few}} surgical instruments I had chanced to leave <b>there.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two, I mislaid my clinical thermometer, and began hunting for it behind a wooden partition {{in the corner of the}} room by the place for washing test-tubes. As I stooped down, turning over the various objects about the tap in my search, Sebastian's voice came to me. He had paused outside the door, and was speaking in his calm, clear tone, very low, to Hilda. [...] "So NOW we understand one another, Nurse Wade," [...] he said, with a significant sneer. [...] "I know whom I have to deal with!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>There</b> {{was silence}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two, and during it {{the beat of}} hoofs {{came out of the}} valley. They drew nearer, and Tomlinson laughed softly as he glanced at the listeners' faces.|$|R
60|$|He {{gazed at}} them dully. Then his eyes strayed {{to the bed}} and {{remained}} fixed <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> good many <b>minutes,</b> while his right hand groped all over the table for the penknife.|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> {{was silence}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> Andrew {{suspected}} {{that it was}} Staffer; {{but he did not}} think it was time to speak, and he knew that Mackellar would take him into his confidence when he saw fit.|$|R
