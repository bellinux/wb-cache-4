500|$|The A-4Gs {{operated}} in several roles while embarked on board Melbourne, and also {{took part in}} training exercises from air bases around Australia. While their main role was to provide air defence for the carrier and other warships using Sidewinder missiles and cannon, the Skyhawks lacked the manoeuvrability needed to be effective fighters, and had relatively poor performance at high altitude. The A-4Gs carried [...] "dumb" [...] bombs and rockets in the ground attack and maritime strike roles as {{they were unable to}} operate guided weapons. The aircraft could also be fitted with a D-704 buddy pod aerial refuelling system, which allowed them to refuel from one another in flight, as well as 150 or 300 gallon capacity drop tanks to extend their range. At this time the A-4Gs were the only Australian military aircraft capable of in-flight refuelling. The Skyhawks' long range and ability to carry a large weapons load meant that they proved more successful in air-to-ground roles than as air defence fighters. While 724 Squadron did not deploy on board the carrier, it took part in training exercises with other RAN units as well as elements of the Australian Army. A particularly important task for the squadron was supporting <b>the</b> <b>work-up</b> of RAN warships by acting as targets; in this role Skyhawks were often deployed to RAAF Base Laverton in Victoria and RAAF Base Pearce in Western Australia. 724 Squadron also formed a Skyhawk-equipped aerobatics team called the Checkmates.|$|E

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect on the number of performed biopsies and costs associated with implementing positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (PET/CT) with 16 alpha-[F- 18]fluoro- 17 beta-oestradiol (FES) or 2 -[F- 18] fluoro- 2 -deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) as an upfront imaging test for diagnosing metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in comparison with <b>the</b> standard <b>work-up</b> in oestrogen receptor-positive women with symptoms. Methods: A published computer simulation model was adapted and validated. Three follow-up strategies were evaluated in a simulated cohort of women with primary breast cancer over a 5 -year-time horizon: (1) <b>the</b> standard <b>work-up,</b> (2) upfront FES-PET/CT and (3) upfront FDG-PET/CT. The main outcome was the number of avoided biopsies to assess MBC. The costs for all three strategies were calculated based on the number of imaging tests and biopsies. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) to avoid a biopsy was calculated only based on the costs of initial imaging and staging tests. Results: The FES-PET/CT strategy decreased the number of biopsies by 39 +/- 9 %, while upfront FDG-PET/CT increased the number of biopsies by 38 +/- 15 % when compared with <b>the</b> standard <b>work-up.</b> Both PET/CT strategies reduced the number of imaging tests and false positives when compared with <b>the</b> standard <b>work-up.</b> <b>The</b> number of false negatives decreased only in the FES-PET/CT strategy. The ICER in the FES-PET/CT strategy per avoided biopsy was 12. 1 +/- 3. 4 thousand Euro. In the FDG-PET/CT strategy, the costs were higher and there were no avoided biopsies as compared with <b>the</b> standard <b>work-up,</b> hence this was an inferior strategy in terms of cost effectiveness. Conclusions: The number of performed biopsies was lower in the FES-PET/CT strategy at an ICER of 12. 1 +/- 3. 4 thousand Euro per biopsy avoided, whereas the application of the FDG-PET/CT did not reduce the number of biopsies and was more expensive. Whether the FES-PET/CT strategy has additional benefits for patients in terms of therapy management has to be evaluated in clinical studies...|$|R

50|$|Liquid-liquid {{extraction}} (LLE), {{also known}} as solvent extraction and partitioning, is a method to separate compounds based on their relative solubilities in two different immiscible liquids, usually water and an organic solvent. It is an extraction of a substance from one liquid into another liquid phase. It consists of transferring one (or more) solute(s) contained in a feed solution to another immiscible liquid (solvent). The solvent that is enriched in solute(s) is called extract. The feed solution that is depleted in solute(s) is called the raffinate. LLE is a basic technique in chemical laboratories, where it is performed {{using a variety of}} apparatus, from separatory funnels to countercurrent distribution equipment.
