40|$|Migraine with aura (MA) {{arises from}} a {{combination}} of genetic and environmental factors. The sibling risk, age at onset, and aura type were compared in 54 MA probands categorised by family history of MA. Three family types were ascertained each having an MA proband and: (1) an MA parent and MA offspring (three generation; n= 15), (2) either an MA parent or an MA offspring (two generation; n= 20), and (3) neither an MA parent nor an MA offspring (one generation; n= 19). The crude recurrence risk to siblings of probands was 2. 7 -fold higher in <b>three</b> <b>generation</b> compared with two generation MA families (chi(2) = 6. 24, p= 0. 0125) and 4. 8 -fold higher in <b>three</b> <b>generation</b> compared with one generation MA families (chi(2) = 9. 95, p< 0. 002). The mean age at onset decreased with an increase in genetic load. The MA probands from <b>three</b> <b>generation</b> families were significantly younger than probands from the one generation families (F= 5. 14, p= 0. 030). MA probands from <b>three</b> <b>generation</b> families {{were more likely to report}} more than one type of aura than MA probands from two generation families (chi(2) = 4. 44, p= 0. 035). The significant difference in genetic loading and the earlier age at onset in the <b>three</b> <b>generation</b> families add further evidence for a genetic basis for MA and the difference in sibling risks demonstrates that the MA population is heterogeneous...|$|R

5|$|Elementary fermions {{are grouped}} into <b>three</b> <b>generations,</b> each {{comprising}} two leptons and two quarks. The first generation includes {{up and down}} quarks, the second strange and charm quarks, and the third bottom and top quarks. All searches for a fourth generation of quarks and other elementary fermions have failed, and there is strong indirect evidence that no more than <b>three</b> <b>generations</b> exist. Particles in higher generations generally have greater mass and less stability, causing them to decay into lower-generation particles by means of weak interactions. Only first-generation (up and down) quarks occur commonly in nature. Heavier quarks can only be created in high-energy collisions (such as in those involving cosmic rays), and decay quickly; however, they {{are thought to have}} been present during the first fractions of a second after the Big Bang, when the universe was in an extremely hot and dense phase (the quark epoch). Studies of heavier quarks are conducted in artificially created conditions, such as in particle accelerators.|$|E

40|$|The objec¬tive of this {{research}} is to find whether, there are differences of emotion expression in <b>three</b> <b>generation</b> of Javanese culture in Yogya¬karta. This research is a quanti¬tative study, using Display Rules Assessment Inventory (DRAl). The subjects of this study were late adolescent, early adulthood and middle adulthood who were born and live in Yogyakarta. The result of {{this research}} shows, there was no difference of emotion expression in different generation of Javanese culture in Yogyakarta (F = 1, 042; P = 0, 356;). All <b>three</b> <b>generation</b> expressed emotion in the same way. This result describes that <b>three</b> <b>generation</b> categories who have been researched are still in the same norms on display rules of emotion in all situation. The researcher argue that the result is influenced by Javanese culture. The Javanese values of respect and the maintenance of social harmony (rukun) are base on principles of normative and moral guidance for social interaction within both the family and community. The strong emphasis on rukun (social harmony) has marked the typical Javanese as inexpressive, avoiding social and personal conflict. These values virtues contribute to harmonious social integration. Ideal human virtues include obedience to superiors (manut), generosity, avoidance of conflict, understanding of others, and empathy. These moral compo¬nents and values that colourize Javanese society are internalized by the children during the earliest years, and significant forces motivating the child's behaviour later in adulthood.

40|$|Targeted {{therapy with}} {{epidermal}} growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKIs) {{is regarded as the}} main accepted first-line treatment on EGFR mutation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although targeted therapy for the first and two generation of TKIs may lead to longer progression-free survival (PFS) and better tolerance for patients, the long-term treatment will inevitably lead to drug resistance. Among them, more than 50 % of acquired resistance is associated with T 790 M mutation.

40|$|The first {{particle}} physics observable whose origin may be sought in string theory is the triple replication {{of the matter}} generations. The class of Z 2 XZ 2 orbifolds of six dimensional compactified tori, that have been most widely studied in the free fermionic formulation, correlate the family triplication with the existence of three twisted sectors in this class. In this work we seek an improved understanding of the geometrical origin of the <b>three</b> <b>generation</b> free fermionic models. Using fermionic and orbifold techniques we classify the Z 2 XZ 2 orbifold with symmetric shifts on six dimensional compactified internal manifolds. We show that perturbative <b>three</b> <b>generation</b> models are not obtained {{in the case of}} Z 2 XZ 2 orbifolds with symmetric shifts on complex tori, and that the perturbative <b>three</b> <b>generation</b> models in this class necessarily employ an asymmetric shift. We present a class of <b>three</b> <b>generation</b> models in which the SO(10) gauge symmetry cannot be broken perturbatively, while preserving the Standard Model matter content. We discuss the potential implications of the asymmetric shift for strong-weak coupling duality and moduli stabilization. We show that the freedom in the modular invariant phases in the N= 1 vacua that control the chiral content, can be interpreted as vacuum expectation values of background fields of the underlying N= 4 theory, whose dynamical components are projected out by the Z 2 -fermionic projections. In this class of vacua the chiral content of the models is determined by the underlying N= 4 mother theory. Comment: 36 pages. Standard LaTe...|$|R
