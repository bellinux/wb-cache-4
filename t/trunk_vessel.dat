40|$|Perlecan 2 ̆ 7 s {{developmental}} {{functions are}} difficult to dissect in placental animals because perlecan disruption is embryonic lethal. In contrast to mammals, cardiovascular function is not essential for early zebrafish development because the embryos obtain adequate oxygen by diffusion. In this study, we use targeted protein depletion coupled with protein-based rescue experiments to investigate the involvement of perlecan and its C-terminal domain V/endorepellin in zebrafish development. The perlecan morphants show a severe myopathy characterized by abnormal actin filament orientation and disorganized sarcomeres, suggesting an involvement of perlecan in myopathies. In the perlecan morphants, primary intersegmental vessel sprouts, which develop through angiogenesis, fail to extend and show reduced protrusive activity. Live videomicroscopy confirms the abnormal swimming pattern caused by the myopathy and anomalous head and <b>trunk</b> <b>vessel</b> circulation. The phenotype is partially rescued by microinjection of human perlecan or endorepellin. These findings indicate that perlecan {{is essential for the}} integrity of somitic muscle and developmental angiogenesis and that endorepellin mediates most of these biological activities...|$|E
40|$|Coronary flow (CF) {{measured}} ex vivo {{is largely}} determined by capillary density that reflects angiogenic vessel {{formation in the}} heart in vivo. Here we exploit this relationship and show that CF in the rat is influenced by a locus on rat chromosome 2 that is also associated with cardiac capillary density. Mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (Wars 2), encoding an L 53 F protein variant within the ATP-binding motif, is prioritized as the candidate at the locus by integrating genomic data sets. WARS 2 (L 53 F) has low enzyme activity and inhibition of WARS 2 in endothelial cells reduces angiogenesis. In the zebrafish, inhibition of wars 2 results in <b>trunk</b> <b>vessel</b> deficiencies, disordered endocardial-myocardial contact and impaired heart function. Inhibition of Wars 2 in the rat causes cardiac angiogenesis defects and diminished cardiac capillary density. Our data demonstrate a pro-angiogenic function for Wars 2 {{both within and outside}} the heart that may have translational relevance given the association of WARS 2 with common human diseases...|$|E
40|$|Transcription factors play {{a central}} role in cell fate determination. Gene {{targeting}} in mice revealed that Chicken Ovalbumin Upstream Promoter-Transcription Factor II (COUP-TFII, also known as Nuclear Receptor 2 F 2 or NR 2 F 2) induces a venous phenotype in endothelial cells (ECs). More recently, NR 2 F 2 was shown to be required for initiating the expression of Prox 1, responsible for lymphatic commitment of venous ECs. Small animal models like zebrafish embryos and Xenopus laevis tadpoles have been very useful to elucidate mechanisms of (lymph) vascular development. Therefore, the role of NR 2 F 2 in (lymph) vascular development was studied by eliminating its expression in these models. Like in mice, absence of NR 2 F 2 in zebrafish resulted in distinct vascular defects including loss of venous marker expression, major <b>trunk</b> <b>vessel</b> fusion and vascular leakage. Both in zebrafish and Xenopus the development of the main lymphatic structures was severely hampered. NR 2 F 2 knockdown significantly decreased prox 1 expression in zebrafish ECs and the same manipulation affected lymphatic (L) EC commitment, migration and function in Xenopus tadpoles. Therefore, the role of NR 2 F 2 in EC fate determination is evolutionary conserved. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Glaucomatous neuroretinal rim loss {{can occur}} in a {{sequence}} of sectors with the temporal inferior disc sector as {{the first and the}} nasal superior disc sector as the last to be affected. This study evaluated whether the position of the central retinal <b>vessel</b> <b>trunk</b> is correlated with this pattern of glaucomatous rim loss. Morphometrically stereo colour optic disc photographs of 157 glaucomatous eyes and 67 normal eyes were checked. In the normal and glaucomatous eyes, the central retinal <b>vessel</b> <b>trunk</b> was located eccentrically in the upper nasal quadrant of the optic disc. Taking into account the vertically oval disc shape, the distance to the central <b>vessel</b> <b>trunk</b> was largest for the temporal inferior disc region and shortest for the nasal superior disc area. An abnormal form of the glaucomatous neuroretinal rim was found in eyes with an atypical location of the retinal <b>vessel</b> <b>trunk.</b> Also in these glaucomatous eyes, the rim loss was usually most and least marked in that sector with the longest and shortest distance, respectively, to the central retinal <b>vessel</b> <b>trunk.</b> One could infer that the sequence of rim loss in glaucoma is dependent upon the distance of the region to the central retinal vessel trunk; the further away the region from the retinal <b>vessel</b> <b>trunk,</b> {{the more likely it is}} to be affected by rim loss. This suggest that the distance from the central retinal vessels is one factor among others that is correlated with the regional vulnerability of the neuroretinal rim to the glaucomatous process...|$|R

To determine how vascular cells migrate and assemble into <b>vessels</b> of the <b>trunk</b> and limb, marked somite-derived angioblasts were followed in developing embryos. Injection of avian somites with the cell-tracker DiI showed that somite-derived angioblasts in unperturbed embryos migrated extensively and contributed to <b>trunk</b> and limb <b>vessels.</b> Mouse–avian chimeras with mouse presomitic mesoderm grafts had graft-derived endothelial cells in blood vessels at significant distances from the graft, indicating that mouse angioblasts migrated extensively in avian hosts. Mouse graft-derived endothelial cells were consistently found in <b>trunk</b> <b>vessels,</b> such as the perineural vascular plexus, the cardinal vein, and presumptive intersomitic vessels, {{as well as in}} vessels of the limb and kidney rudiment. This reproducible pattern of graft colonization suggests that avian vascular patterning cues for <b>trunk</b> and limb <b>vessels</b> are recognized by mammalian somitic angioblasts. Mouse–quail chimeras stained with both the quail vascular marker QH 1 and the mouse vascular marker PECAM- 1 had finely chimeric vessels, with graft-derived mouse cells interdigitated with quail vascular cells in most vascular beds colonized by graft cells. Thus, diverse trunk and limb blood vessels have endothelial cells that developed from migratory somitic angioblasts, and assembly of these vessels is likely to have a large vasculogenic component...|$|R
40|$|To better {{understand}} the mechanisms of disease progression and the efficacy of interventions {{there is a need}} to develop and refine imaging methods for phenotyping animal models of complex traits associated with pulmonary hypertension. To investigate pulmonary arterial tree structure-function in this context, a high resolution micro-CT scanner has been utilized for imaging anesthetized small animals and excised organs maintained in a near-physiologic state. In this study, the X-ray CT system and image reconstructions were used to evaluate hypoxia induced changes in vascular architecture and mechanics in Fawn Hooded rats from which the lungs were removed after three weeks in an exposure chamber with inspired O 2 of 21. 0 % (normoxic) or 11. 5 % (hypoxic). The pulmonary arterial tree was filled with perfluorooctyl bromide (Perflubron) for x-ray contrast and the isolated lungs were imaged with the intravascular pressure, P, ranging from 5 to 30 mmHg. Methods were developed to identify and locate individual vessel segments within the pulmonary arterial tree and to measure their diameters as a function of pressure. The complexity of the pulmonary arterial tree is remarkable. Thus, three-dimensional volumetric images provide very complex data sets. A method for summarizing the image data for more than a million vessel segments is necessary. An approach based on the fractal characteristics of the pulmonary arterial network is developed herein. It involves measuring the diameters of the larger <b>trunk</b> <b>vessel</b> and the smaller branch at each bifurcation and the distances between bifurcations along the longest pulmonary arterial pathway, beginning at the pulmonary artery and ending with the terminal arteriole. Then, assuming self-consistency within the pulmonary arterial tree, the whole tree structure may be extrapolated. This is accomplished by measuring the diameter, D, versus length, x, from the main pulmonary arterial inlet over the range of pressures. The equations D(x,P) = D(0,P) (1 + αP) (1 - x/Ltot) c and D BR (x,P) = DBR (0,P) (1 + αP) (1 - x/Ltot) c are then fit to the data, where α is vascular distensibility and D, DBR, Ltot and c are morphometric parameters descriptive of the tree architecture. The parameters also provide inputs to a hemodynamic model that can be used to determine how the structural features represented by the parameters influence pressure-flow relationships within the pulmonary arterial tree. Morphometric analysis of lungs from normal and chronically hypoxic Fawn Hooded rats indicated that decreased vessel distensibility was the key feature of hypoxic remodeling. This type of analysis promises to be a useful tool for providing insight into pulmonary arterial structure-function relationships associated with pulmonary hypertension...|$|E

This allows detailed analyses such as quantification of the area, evaluation of the branching pattern, and detection of novel measures of CNV activity such as fractal analysis [65, 66]. Morphological pattern analysis of CNV on OCTA has allowed identification of two major categories: (1) sea fan configuration with densely packed networks and capillary sprouts; and (2) medusa head pattern with large diameter vessels sprouting from a central vessel. OCTA {{has been shown to}} be useful in the determination of biological markers of activity of the CNV lesion, i.e., the presence of features such as perilesional halo, increased complexity of branching and capillary sprouts, and alteration of choriocapillaris flow at the margins are indicators of an active lesion [66, 67]. On the other hand, lesions with large <b>trunk</b> <b>vessels</b> with minimal branching indicate residual inactive networks in AMD which may not require therapy.|$|R
40|$|Vascular {{networks}} surrounding individual {{organs are}} important for their development, maintenance, and function; however, how these networks are assembled remains poorly understood. Here we show that CNS progenitors, referred to as radial glia, modulate vascular patterning around the spinal cord by acting as negative regulators. We found that radial glia ablation in zebrafish embryos leads to excessive sprouting of the <b>trunk</b> <b>vessels</b> around the spinal cord, and exclusively those of venous identity. Mechanistically, we determined that radial glia control this process via the Vegf decoy receptor sFlt 1 : sflt 1 mutants exhibit the venous over-sprouting observed in radial glia-ablated larvae, and sFlt 1 overexpression rescues it. Genetic mosaic analyses show that sFlt 1 function in trunk endothelial cells can limit their over-sprouting. Together, our findings identify CNS-resident progenitors as critical angiogenic regulators that determine the precise patterning of the vasculature around the spinal cord, providing novel insights into vascular network formation around developing organs...|$|R

In this manuscript, we review the midterm results of fenestrated compared with chimney configurations for proximal aortic aneurysm disease. MethodsWe performed an analysis of all patients with chimney grafts or custom fenestrated endografts used for treatment of proximal thoracic aneurysm disease (involving the supra-aortic <b>trunk</b> <b>vessels)</b> presenting to our institution between 2004 and 2013. Patients were identified by retrospective chart review and through the prospective database (National Institutes of Health study number NCT 00583050). Details of devices placed, intraoperative details, and measurements from postoperative imaging were included in the analysis. The primary outcomes of interest were long-term freedom from branch stent complications and freedom from proximal endoleak, but we also included perioperative events, in-hospital mortality, and requirement for secondary interventions in our review. The log-rank test (Mantel-Cox) was used to compare survival data. Student t-test (two tailed) and Fisher exact test (two tailed) were used for continuous and categorical data, respectively. ResultsOf 767 patients who underwent thoracic endovascular repair from January 2004 to February 2013, 33 satisfied the inclusion criteria (4 %) : 18 of 33 noncustom and 15 of 33 custom graft designs. Overall, the rate of technical success was 97 %. There were four branch stent-related problems in the follow-up period, one of 15 (7 %) in the custom group and three of 18 (17 %) in the noncustom group. There were three proximal sealing failures in the immediate postoperative and follow-up period, one of 15 (7 %) in the custom group and two of 18 (11 %) in the noncustom group. Overall, 10 patients underwent secondary procedures, four of 15 (27 %) in the custom group and six of 18 (33 %) in the noncustom group. ConclusionsAlthough they are technically feasible, both custom fenestrated endografts and chimney repairs for proximal thoracic disease involving the supra-aortic <b>trunk</b> <b>vessels</b> suffer from failures in intermediate follow-up, with a trend toward better long-term outcomes for custom devices.

40|$|Platelet-derived {{growth factor}} (PDGF) plays an {{important}} role in development of the central nervous system, including the retina. Excessive PDGF signaling is associated with proliferative retinal disorders. We reported previously that transgenic mice in which PDGF-B was over-expressed under control of the nestin enhancer, nes/tk-PdgfB-lacZ, exhibited enhanced apoptosis in the developing corpus striatum. These animals display enlarged lateral ventricles after birth as well as behavioral aberrations as adults. Here, we report that in contrast to the relatively mild central nervous system phenotype, development of the retina is severely disturbed in nes/tk-PdgfB-lacZ mice. In transgenic retinas all nuclear layers were disorganized and photoreceptor segments failed to develop properly. Since astrocyte precursor cells did not populate the retina, retinal vascular progenitors could not form a network of vessels. With time, randomly distributed vessels resembling capillaries formed, but there were no large <b>trunk</b> <b>vessels</b> and the intraocular pressure was reduced. In addition, we observed a delayed regression of the hyaloid vasculature. The prolonged presence of this structure may contribute to the other abnormalities observed in the retina, including the defective lamination...|$|R
40|$|Angiogenesis, {{although}} a natural process, when deregulated can {{be associated with}} many human pathologies, including cancer. The endothelial cells {{play a crucial role in}} the growth and remodelling of the vasculature. A novel unique endothelial marker, endothelial cell specific chemotaxis regulator (ECSCR), has been identified and the aim of this project was to characterise its expression patterns and mechanism of action. In HUVECs the interaction with filamin A was confirmed and immunoprecipitation has pulled down several cytoskeletal proteins involved in cell movement, including moesin, that binds to ECSCR. ECSCR loss causes cytoskeleton to be disorganised and overexpression induces filopodia in HEK 293 T cells, but not M 2 cells, that do not contain filamin A. In zebrafish ECSCR is restricted to the major trunk and head vasculature, whereas in mouse it appears to be present also in the intersegmental vessels. Morpholino mediated knockdown of zebrafish Escr caused disruption of intersegmental vessel sprouting from the <b>trunk</b> <b>vessels.</b> The original phenotype was successfully rescued. A null Ecscr knockout mouse has been produced and preliminary data show that the deletion is not lethal and ECSCR is present in some small vessels, but not all vasculature.

40|$|AbstractSox 7 and Sox 18 {{are members}} of the F-subgroup of Sox {{transcription}} factors family and are mostly expressed in endothelial compartments. In humans, dominant mutations in Sox 18 are the underlying cause of the severe hypotrichosis–lymphedema–telangiectasia disorder characterized by vascular defects. However little is known about which vasculogenic processes Sox 7 and Sox 18 regulate in vivo. We cloned the orthologs of Sox 7 and Sox 18 in zebrafish, analysed their expression pattern and performed functional analyses. Both genes are expressed in the lateral plate mesoderm during somitogenesis. At later stages, Sox 18 is expressed in all axial vessels whereas Sox 7 expression is mainly restricted to the dorsal aorta. Knockdown of Sox 7 or Sox 18 alone failed to reveal any phenotype. In contrast, blocking the two genes simultaneously led to embryos displaying dysmorphogenesis of the proximal aorta and arteriovenous shunts, all of which can account for the lack of circulation observed in the trunk and tail. Gene expression analyses performed with general endothelial markers on double morphants revealed that Sox 7 and Sox 18 are dispensable for the initial specification and positioning of the major <b>trunk</b> <b>vessels.</b> However, morphants display ectopic expression of the venous Flt 4 marker in the dorsal aorta and a concomitant reduction of the artery-specific markers EphrinB 2 a and Gridlock.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{optic nerve}} characteristics independent of systemic factors predisposing to parafoveal scotoma in normal tension glaucoma. METHODS: We included 40 patients with bilateral normal tension glaucoma with parafoveal scotoma (visual field defect in one hemifield within 10 ° of fixation {{with at least}} one point at p< 1 % lying at the two innermost paracentral points) in only one eye (Parafoveal group, PF, n =  40) identified from the hospital database in this observational cross sectional study. The other eye with no parafoveal scotoma constituted the control group (n =  32). Red free fundus photographs were evaluated using Image J software analyzing parameters including vertical and horizontal disc diameter, disc haemorrhage, location and angular width of the retinal nerve fibre layer depth and displacement of the central <b>vessel</b> <b>trunk,</b> CVT (vertical and horizontal). Clinical characteristics and disc parameters were compared in the two groups. RESULTS: The PF group had lower mean deviation(MD) and visual field index (VFI) and higher pattern standard deviation (PSD) than control group (p≤ 0. 001) for similar untreated IOP, (p =  0. 9). Disc haemorrhages were more frequent in the PF group, p =  0. 01. The PF group had greater width of nerve fibre layer defects, p =  0. 05 and greater vertical displacement of the central <b>vessel</b> <b>trunk,</b> p =  0. 001. On multivariate logistic regression, parafoveal scotoma was significantly associated with increased vertical distance of the CVT, p =  0. 0001.

40|$|AbstractFormation of a {{functional}} vasculature during mammalian development {{is essential for}} embryonic survival. In addition, imbalance in blood vessel growth contributes to the pathogenesis of numerous disorders. Most of our understanding of vascular development and blood vessel growth comes from investigating the Vegf signaling pathway {{as well as the}} recent observation that molecules involved in axon guidance also regulate vascular patterning. In order to take an unbiased, yet focused, approach to identify novel genes regulating vascular development, we performed a three-step ENU mutagenesis screen in zebrafish. We first screened live embryos visually, evaluating blood flow in the main <b>trunk</b> <b>vessels,</b> which form by vasculogenesis, and the intersomitic vessels, which form by angiogenesis. Embryos that displayed reduced or absent circulation were fixed and stained for endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity to reveal blood vessel morphology. All putative mutants were then crossed into the Tg(flk 1 :EGFP) s 843 transgenic background to facilitate detailed examination of endothelial cells in live and fixed embryos. We screened 4015 genomes and identified 30 mutations affecting various aspects of vascular development. Specifically, we identified 3 genes (or loci) that regulate the specification and/or differentiation of endothelial cells, 8 genes that regulate vascular tube and lumen formation, 8 genes that regulate vascular patterning, and 11 genes that regulate vascular remodeling, integrity and maintenance. Only 4 of these genes had previously been associated with vascular development in zebrafish illustrating the value of this focused screen. The analysis of the newly defined loci should lead to a greater understanding of vascular development and possibly provide new drug targets to treat the numerous pathologies associated with dysregulated blood vessel growth...|$|R

Zebrafish intersegmental vessels correspond to mammalian capillary sprouts, whereas the axial vessels correspond to larger blood vessels, such as arteries. The zebrafish NRP 1 gene (znrp 1) was isolated and when overexpressed in cells, zNRP 1 protein was a functional receptor for human VEGF 165. Whole-mount in situ hybridization showed that transcripts for znrp 1 during embryonic and early larval development were detected mainly in neuronal and vascular tissues.

The result was a potent inhibition of blood cell circulation via both intersegmental and axial vessels demonstrating that VEGF and NRP 1 act synergistically to promote a functional circulatory system.

Conventional 3 -D T 1 -weighted MRI with gadolinium and MRA pulse sequences were acquired in frameless stereotactic conditions the day before surgery and thereafter registered, allowing the definition a minimally invasive straight trajectory to the aneurysm neck. MRA-guided neurosurgery allowed a direct approach to the aneurysms at their proper location, reducing the invasiveness of the approach by tailoring the bone opening and reducing the duration and extension of brain retraction. The technique also avoided unnecessary dissection and exposure of the main <b>trunks</b> and collateral <b>vessels.</b> The aneurysms were successfully eradicated without complication.

40|$|SummaryTissue {{branching}} morphogenesis {{requires the}} hierarchical organization of sprouting cells into leading “tip” and trailing “stalk” cells [1, 2]. During new blood vessel branching (angiogenesis), endothelial tip cells (TCs) lead sprouting vessels, extend filopodia, and migrate {{in response to}} gradients of the secreted ligand, vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) [3]. In contrast, adjacent stalk cells (SCs) trail TCs, generate the <b>trunk</b> of new <b>vessels,</b> and critically maintain connectivity with parental vessels. Here, we establish that h 2. 0 -like homeobox- 1 (Hlx 1) determines SC potential, which is critical for angiogenesis during zebrafish development. By combining a novel pharmacological strategy for the manipulation of angiogenic cell behavior in vivo with transcriptomic analyses of sprouting cells, we identify the uniquely sprouting-associated gene, hlx 1. Expression of hlx 1 is almost entirely restricted to sprouting endothelial cells and is excluded from adjacent nonangiogenic cells. Furthermore, Hlx 1 knockdown reveals its essential role in angiogenesis. Importantly, mosaic analyses uncover a cell-autonomous role for Hlx 1 in the maintenance of SC identity in sprouting vessels. Hence, Hlx 1 -mediated maintenance of SC potential regulates angiogenesis, a finding that may have novel implications for sprouting morphogenesis of other tissues...|$|R

Other inventions included the trenchcoat worn by British army officers during the 1914-1918 war (a claim also made by Aquascutum). The company made over 28,000 trenchcoats over the course of the war, retaining in the 1930s a list of the first 15,000 purchasers, with their regiments.|$|R
60|$|Rachel {{peered through}} the gate, but so dense was the gloom in that holy spot that at first she could only see the {{enormous}} red bole of the cedar, and the ghostly, moss-clad branches which sprang from it at no great height above the ground. Presently, however, her eyes, grown accustomed to the light, distinguished several little white-robed figures seated upon the earth at {{some distance from the}} <b>trunk</b> staring into <b>vessels</b> of wood which were placed before them. These figures appeared to be those of both men and women, while one was that of a child. Even as they watched, the figure nearest to them fell forward over its bowl and lay quite still, whereon those around it set up a feeble, piping cry, that yet had in it a note of gladness. The dwarf-mutes who had accompanied them, and who alone seemed to have a right of entry into this sad place, ran forward and looked. Then very gently they lifted up the fallen figure and bore it out. As it was carried past them Rachel noted that it was the body of quite a young woman, whose little face, wasted to nothing, still looked sweet and gentle.|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVOS: Avaliar a correlação entre as hemorragias peripapilares (HPPs) e a posição do tronco {{vascular}} na cabeça do nervo óptico. MÉTODOS: Retinografias de 1. 830 pacientes foram revisadas. A posição do tronco vascular retiniano (TVR) foi classificada de acordo com sua localização no hemisfério superior ou inferior e sua posição relativa através da razão entre a distância entre o TVR e o ponto mais inferior do disco óptico e o diâmetro vertical do disco óptico (razão tronco/disco). Pacientes da mesma população, com glaucoma e sem HPPs foram aleatoriamente selecionados para comparação. RESULTADOS: Dos 1. 830 pacientes, 46 apresentaram HPPs. Foram detectadas 53 hemorragias em 41 pacientes com glaucoma ou suspeitos de glaucoma, principalmente na região temporal inferior (47, 2 %). Observou-se concordância negativa entre a localização superior ou inferior do TVR e das HPPs (Kappa= - 0, 34). Considerando a posição relativa do TVR em relação ao diâmetro vertical do disco óptico (razão tronco/disco), encontramos melhor correlação (valores médios da razão tronco/disco: 0, 450 -hemorragias superiores e 0, 510 -hemorragias inferiores; p= 0, 027). No grupo com HPPs, observamos porcentagem significativamente maior de pacientes com glaucoma de pressão normal (GPN) se comparado ao grupo sem hemorragia (p= 0, 009). CONCLUSÃO: HPPs foram mais comuns no hemisfério oposto ao da emergência do TVR. Observamos maior prevalência de GPN nos pacientes com hemorragias que nos sem hemorragia. PURPOSE: To {{investigate the}} correlation between optic disc hemorrhages (ODHs) and {{the position of the}} central retinal <b>vessel</b> <b>trunk</b> (RVT) in patients with glaucoma. METHODS: Fundus photographs of 1, 830 participants were reviewed. The exit position of the central retinal <b>vessel</b> <b>trunk</b> was classified as being in the superior or inferior hemisphere of the optic disc and the relative vertical position was expressed as a fraction of the disc diameter (ratio between the position of the trunk and the diameter of the disk). A group of patients from the same population, but without ODHs, was randomly selected and compared with the patients with ODHs. RESULTS: Among the 1, 830 patients, 53 hemorrhages were detected in 41 patients with glaucoma or suspected glaucoma. We found an inverse relationship between the inferior/superior position of the central RVT and the inferior/superior position of the hemorrhages (Kappa= - 0. 34). Using the trunk/disc ratio, we found that superior ODHs correlated with inferior RVTs (trunk/disc ratio, 0. 450; SD= 0. 070) and inferior ODHs correlated with superior RVTs (trunk/disc ratio, 0. 510; SD= 0. 054) (p= 0. 027). The number of patients with normal tension glaucoma was significantly higher among patients with ODHs than among those without ODHs (p= 0. 009). CONCLUSION: Our patients had a negative correlation between the position of central RVT and the location of the ODHs. Normal tension glaucoma was more prevalent among patients with ODHs than among those without it...|$|R
40|$|Multi-chamber heart {{segmentation}} is {{a prerequisite}} for quantification of the cardiac function. In this paper, we propose an automatic heart chamber segmentation system. There are two closely related tasks to develop such a system: heart modeling and automatic model fitting to an unseen volume. The heart is a complicated non-rigid organ with four chambers and several major <b>vessel</b> <b>trunks</b> attached. A flexible and accurate model is necessary to capture the heart chamber shape at an appropriate level of details. In our four-chamber surface mesh model, the following two factors are considered and traded-off: 1) accuracy in anatomy and 2) easiness for both annotation and automatic detection. Important landmarks such as valves and cusp points on the interventricular septum are explicitly represented in our model. These landmarks can be detected reliably to guide the automatic model fitting process. We also propose two mechanisms, the rotation-axis based and parallel-slice based resampling methods, to establish mesh point correspondence, which is necessary to build a statistical shape model to enforce priori shape constraints in the model fitting procedure. Using this model, we develop an efficient and robust approach for automatic heart chamber segmentation in 3 D computed tomography (CT) volumes. Our approach is based on recent advances in learning discriminative object models and we exploit a large database of annotated CT volumes. We formulate the segmentation as a twoste...|$|R
40|$|The Galea is a rodent {{from the}} Cavidae family. The {{aim of this}} study was to {{describe}} the intraparenchymal origin and distribuition of the galea hepatic artery considering the inexistence of information in the literature. Animals (n= 20) from Centro de Multiplicação de Animais Silvestres Mossoró-RN Brazil were evaluated after dying by natural causes. The animals were incised medially and the thoracic aorta was cannulated for injection of latex or vinyl. The animals perfused with latex were fixed in formaldehyde 10 % and dissected after 72 hours. The ones perfused with vinyl acetate had their liver removed and immersed in a 30 % H 2 SO 4 solution until the complete corrosion of its parenchyma. It was observed that the hepatic artery in galea originates from the celiac artery and, along the way toward the liver, it sends off the gastroduodenal artery and then the right gastric artery, continuing as proper hepatic artery. This one is divided into right and left branches or sends off an intermediate branch. The left branch proved to be a common <b>trunk</b> to the <b>vessels</b> destined to the left lateral, left medial and square lobes. The right branch of the hepatic artery sends off branches to right lateral, right medial and caudate lobes. The origin and distribution patterns of the intraparenchymal hepatic artery in galea is similar to other rodents...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Freestyle Perforator flaps {{minimize}} flap harvest {{morbidity and}} can be harvested anywhere in the body if perforators anatomy is well known. A study of <b>trunk</b> perforator <b>vessels</b> has been performed on recycled CT scans avoiding cadaver investigations or unnecessary radiation exposure. Materials and Methods: 200 CT scans, performed {{for the study of}} liver or pancreatic disease, were examined. No unnecessary radiation was administered. Previous abdominal surgery was reason of exclusion. The trunk between the xyphoid process and Downloaded by: Biomedische Bibliotheek 193. 191. 170. 2 - 10 / 8 / 2014 8 : 35 : 28 AM Abstracts Eur Surg Res 2012; 49 : 130 – 216 215 the umbilicus was studied. On axial scans, the trunk was divided in 4 quadrants: Q 1 anterior right, Q 2 anterior left, Q 3 posterior left, Q 4 posterior right,. Scans were examined and the position of any perforator > 1 mm in caliber was measured. The values were transferred on a MS excel® data sheet and analyzed. Results: The average number of perforators per patient was 25, 63 (6, 09 Q 1, 7, 21 Q 2, 6, 20 Q 3, 6, 14 Q 4). Anteriorly, the majority of perforators were between 0 and 5 cm from the midline, while posteriorly between 5 and 10 cm. The perforators are more numerous and symmetric anteriorly (Q 1 and Q 2). Perforators course within the subcutaneous tissue was vertical or oblique for perforators of the Superior Epigastric Artery, horizontal or oblique for perforators of the lateral intercostal arteries, vertical or oblique for perforators of the posterior intercostal arteries. Conclusions: The region of the trunk between the xyphoid process and the umbilicus has several perforators of more than 1 mm in caliber that might potentially be used as pedicle of freestyle flaps. This study provides a map of the location of perforator in the middle trunk to serve as a guide for the surgeon to harvest free style flaps in this area. This study also introduces the concept of recycling existing CT scans for the purposes of anatomical investigation and might encourage others to exploi...|$|R
