5|$|In October 1963, London Transport ordered five {{double decker}} buses {{based on the}} Ford Thames Trader chassis for special duties, taking cyclists through the Dartford Tunnel. These had a lower deck {{purpose-built}} for carrying bicycles, with upper deck seats for cyclists. Access was via a stairwell to the upper deck starting several feet above {{the level of the}} road, accessible from special platforms built {{at either end of the}} tunnel; there was also a ladder built into the side of the bodywork for access elsewhere. The design was criticised for failing to protect any passenger from falling off the vehicle, and running costs were estimated at £2,550 per month, with only £45 revenue. The service was reduced to one bus in April 1964 and then cancelled in 1965, to be replaced by the current <b>transfer</b> <b>service.</b> One of these buses has been preserved.|$|E
