The combat system was completely redone and did not use any animations from the first game. Because Sora had matured, Nomura wanted his fighting style to reflect that. Other changes included more integration between exploration and battles. <b>The</b> <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> combat styles associated with each Drive Form and the introduction of the Reaction Command were added to give players more choices in battles.

5|$|Radioactive cosmogenic 10Be is {{produced}} in {{the atmosphere of the}} Earth by the cosmic ray spallation of oxygen. 10Be accumulates at the soil surface, where its relatively long half-life (1.36 million years) permits a long residence time before decaying to boron-10. Thus, 10Be and its daughter products are used to examine natural soil erosion, soil formation and the development of lateritic soils, and as a proxy for measurement of <b>the</b> <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> solar activity and the age of ice cores. The production of 10Be is inversely proportional to solar activity, because increased solar wind during periods of high solar activity decreases the flux of galactic cosmic rays that reach the Earth. Nuclear explosions also form 10Be by the reaction of fast neutrons with 13C in the carbon dioxide in air. This is one of the indicators of past activity at nuclear weapon test sites.|$|E

The Ik-style ceramics are believed to have been produced in the period from 740800 AD. In spite of differences, all the Ik-style ceramics are thought to have been made within a network of allied workshops dedicated to producing vessels for use in the banquets of the aristocracy of Motul de San José and of the petty nobility of the capital's satellites. The ceramics were distributed widely in the Maya region as gifts in order to seal alliances between the elites of various Maya kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|To help clarify {{species and}} {{subspecies}} boundaries, {{and to establish}} whether morphology-based classifications were consistent with evolutionary relationships, the phylogenetic relationships within the genus Nycticebus have been investigated using DNA sequences derived from the mitochondrial markers D loop and cytochrome b. Although most of the recognized lineages of Nycticebus (including N.pygmaeus, N. menagensis and N.javanicus) were shown to be genetically distinct—the analysis suggested that DNA sequences from some individuals of N.coucang and N.bengalensis apparently share a closer evolutionary relationship with each other than with {{members of their own}} species. The authors suggest that this result may be explained by introgressive hybridization, as the tested individuals of these two taxa originated from a region of sympatry in southern Thailand; the precise origin of one of the N.coucang individuals was not known.

It is possible that antioxidants play a large part in this protective effect. However, which foods account for <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> antioxidant intake in a population is not very clear. We used food frequency data from a population-based sample of women to identify the food items that contributed most to <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> antioxidant intake in Norwegian diet. Methods We used data from a study conducted among participants in the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP), the national program which invites women aged 50 – 69 years to mammographic screening every 2 years. A subset of 6514 women who attended the screening in 2006 / 2007 completed a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Daily intake of energy, nutrients and antioxidant intake were estimated. We used multiple linear regression analysis to capture <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> antioxidant intake. Results The mean (SD) antioxidant intake was 23. 0 (8. 5) mmol/day. Coffee consumption explained 54 % of <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> antioxidant intake, while fruits {{and vegetable}}s explained 22 %. The twenty food items that contributed most to <b>the</b> total <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> antioxidant intake explained 98 % of <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> intake.
