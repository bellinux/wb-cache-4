40|$|Although HAART {{suppresses}} HIV replication, it {{is often}} unable to restore immune homeostasis. Consequently, non-AIDS-defining diseases are increasingly seen in treated individuals. This is attributed to persistent virus expression in reservoirs and to cell activation. Of note, in CD 4 (+) T cells and monocyte-macrophages of virologically-suppressed individuals, there is continued expression of multi-spliced transcripts encoding HIV regulatory proteins. Among <b>them,</b> <b>Tat</b> is essential for virus gene expression and replication, either in primary infection or for virus reactivation during HAART, when Tat is expressed, released extracellularly and exerts, on both the virus and the immune system, effects that contribute to disease maintenance. Here we report results of an ad hoc exploratory interim analysis (up to 48 weeks) on 87 virologically-suppressed HAART-treated individuals enrolled in a phase II randomized open-label multicentric clinical trial of therapeutic immunization with Tat (ISS T- 002). Eighty-eight virologically-suppressed HAART-treated individuals, enrolled in a parallel prospective observational study at the same sites (ISS OBS T- 002), served for intergroup comparison. Immunization with Tat was safe, induced durable immune responses, and modified the pattern of CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) cellular activation (CD 38 and HLA-DR) together with reduction of biochemical activation markers and persistent increases of regulatory T cells. This {{was accompanied by a}} progressive increment of CD 4 (+) T cells and B cells with reduction of CD 8 (+) T cells and NK cells, which were independent from the type of antiretroviral regimen. Increase in central and effector memory and reduction in terminally-differentiated effector memory CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cells were accompanied by increases of CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cell responses against Env and recall antigens. Of note, more immune-compromised individuals experienced greater therapeutic effects. In contrast, these changes were opposite, absent or partial in the OBS population.

40|$|Recent {{observations}} in cell culture {{provide evidence that}} negatively charged glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) at the surface of biological cells bind cationic cell-penetrating compounds (CPCs) and cluster during CPC binding, thereby contributing to their endocytotic uptake. The GAG binding and clustering occur in the low-micromolar concentration range and suggest a tight interaction between GAGs and CPCs, although the relation between binding affinity and specificity of this interaction remains to be investigated. We therefore measured the GAG binding and clustering of various mono- and multivalent CPCs such as DNA transfection vectors (polyethylenimine; 1, 2 -dioleoyl- 3 -trimethylammonium-propane), amino acid homopolymers (oligoarginine; oligolysine), and cell-penetrating peptides (Penetratin; HIV- 1 <b>Tat)</b> by <b>means</b> of isothermal titration calorimetry and dynamic light scattering. We find that these structurally diverse CPCs share the property of GAG binding and clustering. The binding is very tight (microscopic dissociation constants between 0. 34 and 1. 34 microM) and thus biologically relevant. The hydrodynamic radius of the resulting aggregates ranges from 78 nm to 586 nm, suggesting that they consist of numerous GAG chains cross-linked by CPCs. Likewise, the membrane-permeant monovalent cation acridine orange leads to GAG binding and clustering, in contrast to its membrane-impermeant structural analogs propidium iodide and ethidium bromide. Because the binding and clustering of GAGs {{were found to be}} a common denominator of all CPCs tested, these properties might be helpful to identify further CPCs...|$|R

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anionic nanoparticles {{consisting of a}} core of PMMA and a shell deriving from Eudragit L 100 / 55 were prepared by an innovative synthetic method based on emulsion polymerization. The formed nanoparticles were characterized for size, surface charge and ability to reversibly bind two basic model proteins (Lysozyme, Trypsin) and a vaccine relevant antigen (HIV- 1 <b>Tat),</b> by <b>means</b> of cell-free studies. Their in vitro toxicity and capability to preserve the biological activity of the HIV- 1 Tat protein were studied in cell culture systems. Finally, their safety and immunogenicity were investigated in the mouse model. RESULTS: The nanoparticles had smooth surface, spherical shape and uniform size distribution with a mean diameter of 220 nm. The shell is characterized by covalently bound carboxyl groups negatively charged at physiological pH, able to reversibly adsorb large amounts (up to 20 % w/w) of basic proteins (Lysozyme, Trypsin and HIV- 1 Tat), mainly through specific electrostatic interactions. The nanoparticles were stable, not toxic to the cells, protected the HIV- 1 Tat protein from oxidation, thus preserving its biological activity and increasing its shelf-life, and efficiently delivered and released it intracellularly. In vivo experiments showed that they are well tolerated and elicit strong immune responses against the delivered antigen in mice. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that these new nanoparticles provide a versatile platform for protein surface adsorption and a promising delivery system particularly when {{the maintenance of the}} biologically active conformation is required for vaccine efficacy...|$|R

Yet, they are occasionally misidentified by biochemical profiling, and even 16 S rRNA gene sequencing may not offer adequate discrimination between certain species groups. Using the 23 B. pseudomallei, four B. thailandensis, and 16 B. cepacia complex genome sequences available, we identified gene targets specific {{to each of}} <b>them</b> (a <b>Tat</b> domain protein, a 70 -kDa protein, and a 12 -kDa protein for B. pseudomallei, B. thailandensis, and the B. cepacia complex, respectively), with an in-house developed algorithm. Using these targets, we designed a robust multiplex PCR assay useful for their identification and detection from soil and simulated sputum samples. For all 43 B. pseudomallei, seven B. thailandensis, and 20 B. cepacia complex (B. multivorans, n = 6; B. cenocepacia, n = 3; B. cepacia, n = 4; B. arboris, n = 2; B. contaminans, B. anthina, and B. pyrrocinia, n = 1 each; other unnamed members, n = 2) isolates, the assay produced specific products of predicted size without false positives or negatives. Of the 60 soil samples screened, 19 (31. 6 %) and 29 (48. 3 %) were positive for B. pseudomallei and the B. cepacia complex, respectively, and in four (6. 7 %) soil samples, the organisms were codetected. DNA sequencing confirmed that all PCR products originated from their targeted loci. This novel pan-genomic analysis approach in target selection is simple, computationally efficient, and potentially applicable to any species that harbors species-specific genes.

The <b>mean</b> <b>TAT</b> from sample collection to results reporting decreased by 69. 4 %, from 108 to 33 minutes, the mean LOS from 11. 1 to 8. 1 hours (27 %; P <. 0001), and the median LOS from 8. 0 to 7. 0 hours (13 %; P =. 0017). A method crossover between the POC and central laboratory methods revealed differences in sensitivity and specificity. Overall, there was no clear preference for either method. Differences in performance for individual drug classes were reconciled by providing interpretive comments with POC results. Following implementation, use of urine testing for drugs of abuse increased by 30 %, which was offset by fewer requests for extended toxicology testing in the central laboratory and more selective ordering of toxicology tests not on the POC panel (alcohols and analgesics). The implementation of a POC urine test panel for drugs of abuse decreased LOS and TAT and essentially replaced central laboratory testing for drugs of abuse. Differences in sensitivity and specificity between POC and central laboratory results require provision of interpretive comments with results.

40|$|International audienceHIV- 1 encodes for {{the small}} basic protein Tat (86 - 101 residues) that {{drastically}} enhances the efficiency of viral transcription. The mechanism enabling Tat nuclear import is not yet clear, but studies using reporter proteins fused to the Tat basic domain indicate that Tat could reach the nucleus by passive diffusion. Tat also uses an unusual transcellular transport pathway. The first step of this pathway involves high-affinity binding of Tat to phosphatidylinositol (4, 5) bisphosphate (PI(4, 5) P(2)), a phospholipid that is concentrated in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and enables Tat recruitment at this level. Tat then crosses the plasma membrane to reach the outside medium. Although unconventional, Tat secretion by infected cells is highly active, and export is the major destination for HIV- 1 Tat. Secreted Tat can bind {{to a variety of}} cell types using several different receptors. Most of <b>them</b> will allow <b>Tat</b> endocytosis. Upon internalization, low endosomal pH triggers a conformational change in Tat that results in membrane insertion. Later steps of Tat translocation to the target-cell cytosol are assisted by Hsp 90, a general cytosolic chaperone. Cytosolic Tat can trigger various cell responses. Indeed, accumulating evidence suggests that extracellular Tat acts as a viral toxin that affects the biological activity of different cell types and has a key role in acquired immune-deficiency syndrome development. This review focuses on some of the recently identified molecular details underlying the unusual transcellular transport pathway used by Tat, such as the role of the single Trp in Tat for its membrane insertion and translocation...|$|R

Methods: the frequency per week of the various typologies of CPA were defined {{on the basis of}} prior evaluations aimed at estimating the clinical benefit for patient care (high priority level, for antimicrobials used to treat acute infections in the critically ill patients; moderate priority level, for those used to treat cytomegalovirus infections in solid organ transplant recipients; mild priority level, for those used to treat chronic infections). The CPAs provided between December 2011 and June 2012 represented the starting database. The measured turnaround time (TAT) of each CPA typology was used as an indicator of the performance of the organizational system according to a predefined scale (high, when within agreed timeframe; acceptable, when 1 - 2 days overdue; low, when > 2 days overdue). Results: 6601 CPAs were provided (77. 4 % for AOUD and 22. 6 % for other hospitals), mainly for antimicrobials with high priority.

40|$|Background {{and aims}} : Blood culture (BC) results are {{essential}} to guide antimicrobial chemotherapy for patients with sepsis. However, BC is a time-consuming exam, which can take several days. Reducing BCs turn around time (TAT) could impact on multiple outcome parameters and TAT monitoring is an important tool for measurement of microbiology laboratory performance. The {{aim of this study}} was to provide an overview of BC TATs among Italian microbiology laboratories. Materials and methods : Five laboratories collected and recorded, for a month period, date and time of the BC processing events. Cumulative TATs were analysed using the GraphPad software. Results : Participating laboratories reported data from 302 sepsis episodes. The median time from when the BC system produced a positive signal until Gram-stain results were reported was 7. 6 hours. A rapid molecular identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was performed in 26. 5 % of BCs. <b>Mean</b> <b>TAT</b> for identification report was significantly lower when a molecular approach was adopted (12 vs. 28. 7 hours, P< 0. 001). Similarly, results of the molecular AST were obtained more than 24 hours in advance compared with phenotypic AST (mean 13. 2 vs. 47. 6, P< 0. 001). TATs from BC positivity of laboratories opened 7 days/week were not significantly lower than those of laboratories opened 6 days/week. Conclusions : BC is a time-consuming exam, however, molecular identification and AST methods can drastically reduce time to results. The lack of difference between TATs observed for laboratories working 7 days/week and 6 days/week, coupled with a high rate of BCs turning positive during the night enable to conclude that the most urgent measure to reduce TATs is the expansion of laboratory regular duty hours...|$|R

2500|$|In the 1980s {{there came}} {{the second wave}} of [...] "band fever" [...] (the first wave came in the 1960-70s, which was much {{influenced}} by the global Beatlemania at that time. Young people thought that forming bands was fashionable. Many new bands emerged at that time, such as Samuel Hui's Lotus, The Wynners, and the Teddy Robin and the Playboys. However, the bands emerged in this first wave were just copying the western music style, mostly covering British and American rock songs, and prefer singing in English rather than Cantonese). Different from the first wave in the 60s, the [...] "band fever" [...] in the 80s did not show an obvious relationship with the global culture at the time being, but much related with the marketing strategy of the local record companies and mass media. Many independent bands and music groups were signed by big record companies, and this made a positive impact to the Hong Kong pop music world, as their works were highly original, with strong individuality, {{and they were all}} devoted to writing songs in local language, i.e. Cantonese. The subjects of their works were different from the mainstream (which was mostly love ballads). Politics and social life were popular subjects for the bands in their creation. The [...] "band fever" [...] also brought variety in musical style to the Hong Kong mainstream music world (which was almost monopolised by Pop-ballad for a long time). Styles like Rock, Metal, Pop-Rock, Folk, Neo-Romantic, Pop and some experimental styles (e.g. Cantorock) were introduced. Among <b>them,</b> Beyond and <b>Tat</b> Ming Pair (達明一派) gave the greatest impact to the Hong Kong music world. Some renowned bands and groups included: Beyond, , Tat Ming Pair, Tai Chi (太極樂隊), Grasshopper (草蜢樂隊), [...] (小虎隊), [...] (夢劇院), [...] (藍戰士), , [...] (風雲樂隊), Citybeat (城市節拍).|$|R
