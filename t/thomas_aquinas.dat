40|$|Entropy and entropy {{generation}} {{are fundamental}} quantities {{in the analysis}} of complex systems. Indeed, they have been proved to be the key in the understanding of many different phenomena and of practical applications in engineering and science. They represent the fundamentals of most modern formulations of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics. In the last twenty years, entropy and entropy generation have been better understood in fundamental aspects and a great number of applications have been developed in classical engineering and new scientific area problems. In this paper, starting from these results, the entropy generation approach is presented as a powerful method of analysis of the brain function, in looked at {{in the light of the}} moralistic and philosophical arguments of Italian philosopher and theologian <b>Thomas</b> <b>Aquina...</b>|$|R

The Thomist doctrine of the unity of form was condemned after these debates. His theological works later were used by his pupil Roger Marston who in turn inspired Duns Scotus.|$|E

5|$|<b>Thomas</b> <b>Aquinas,</b> while proposing five proofs of God's {{existence}} in his Summa Theologica, objected to Anselm's argument. He suggested that people cannot know {{the nature of}} God and, therefore, cannot conceive of God in the way Anselm proposed. The ontological argument would be meaningful only to someone who understands the essence of God completely. Aquinas reasoned that, as only God can completely know His essence, only He could use the argument. His rejection of the ontological argument caused other Catholic theologians to also reject the argument.|$|E

5|$|<b>Thomas</b> <b>Aquinas</b> {{argued that}} {{statements}} about God are analogous to human experience. An analogous term is partly univocal (has only one meaning) and partly equivocal (has {{more than one}} potential meaning) because an analogy {{is in some ways}} the same and in some ways different from the subject. He proposed that those godly qualities which resemble human qualities are described analogously, with reference to human terms; for example, when God is described as good, {{it does not mean that}} God is good in human terms, but that human goodness is used as a reference to describe God's goodness.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thomas</b> <b>Aquinas,</b> a thirteenth-century {{scholastic}} {{philosopher and}} theologian {{heavily influenced by}} Augustine, proposed a form of the Augustinian theodicy in his Summa Theologica.

Aquinas proposed that all goodness in the world must exist perfectly in God, and that, existing perfectly, God must be perfectly good. He concluded that God is goodness, {{and that there is}} no evil in God.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} truth is an eternal one. This problem charges {{us with the}} duty of {{exploring}} the truth.

Two distinct approaches can be adopted to explain this intriguing phenomenon. Scholars of St <b>Thomas</b> of <b>Aquinas</b> will no doubt prefer one that imagines zillions of Vodka fairies dancing frenetically on the ice cubes. The other would involve constructing a hypothesis (vigorous shaking apparently encourages the off-gassing of aldehydes from the vermouth that does not occur when merely stirred) and undertaking a double blind, placebo controlled trial to investigate the taste sensations reported by a statistically significant (Fishers exact test p= 0. 001) matched cohort...|$|R
