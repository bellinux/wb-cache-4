25|$|Willy was {{the sole}} carer of his senile mother, and desperate to get the funds {{to pay for her}} {{placement}} at a nursing home, he decides to con Arthur into signing the fund money into various accounts, and then leaves Arthur to deal with the consequences when the money is declared missing. For a second time, Arthur is faced with a police investigation and with all the evidence stacked against him, he is soon arrested and ends the year behind bars. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for Arthur, who is unable to face the prospect of serving a prison sentence for a crime he didn't commit, and upon his imprisonment he suffers a mental breakdown and refuses any contact with his family.|$|E
2500|$|Two couples, after {{finishing}} a meal together, {{sit down to}} chat. [...] Bram (Thompson) unfastens his pants; his wife Nina (McKinney) is slightly embarrassed, but the other couple insist that it's all right, that they shouldn't feel embarrassed about doing anything in front of old friends. [...] Bram proceeds to take the idea to the extreme, first flirting and then copulating with the other woman (McDonald) while her unconcerned husband Tom (Foley) chats with Nina about his own impotence and his past experimentation with homosexuality. [...] Nina, trying {{to join in the}} spirit of defying convention, confesses that she and Bram hated the lamp that the other couple once gave them; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> and the party is ruined.|$|E
2500|$|Flea {{has been}} very outspoken towards guns and gun violence, {{sometimes}} speaking about it during Chili Peppers shows. He often expresses his anger on his Twitter page. In 2013, he said [...] "why anyone would ever want to own an automatic weapon I will never ever understand. it's a pathetic useless concept for sick people. Automatic, semi automatic, I don't care. I'm against em........ Melt em all down turn em into sculptures {{there is no need}} for them on earth. In many countries, the cops have no guns and they do perfectly fine. No civilians should be allowed to have guns. none. and I don't think the cops should have guns either. change the constitution". Following the racially motivated Charleston church shooting in June 2015, Flea again voiced his anger towards gun violence saying [...] "You are kidding me. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> Humans are an over rated species. Sick. God help us." [...] and [...] "The USA land where any sick madman can easily get a gun. disgusting, deplorable, unbelievable." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mark's friend Joe Wallace dies of an AIDS related illness, {{and after}} visiting {{him in the}} hospice, he meets a Scottish woman named Ruth Aitken (Caroline Paterson), who is also visiting a friend. After a brief conversation, the two decide {{to go for a}} drink together. They start dating and Ruth copes with his HIV status but her father, a strict Presbyterian minister, refuses to give his blessing to her {{relationship}} with Mark and disowns her when she announces her plans to marry Mark. They marry in Scotland but problems surface in their marriage. She persuades Mark - and herself - that she is happy about not having children, but it is soon clear that she is fooling herself. Mark is forced to confront the Square's prejudices when the residents discover his HIV status. Mark is devastated when Arthur dies of a brain haemorrhage after being involved in a prison riot. On the day of his father's funeral, Mark becomes angry that Willy Roper (Michael Tudor-Barnes) had framed Arthur for embezzlement and assaults Willy at the cemetery. He believes that {{he was the one who}} led to Arthur's death. The depth of ignorance concerning the illness doesn't help and, led by Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), the residents begin to boycott Mark's fruit and vegetable stall, fearing they will catch the virus. Pauline springs to her son's defence and she and Peggy have a vicious fight, but even Pauline can't diffuse the prejudice, and Mark comes home to find the words [...] "AIDS scum" [...] graffitied on his wall. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> and he decides to present his neighbours with a few facts about his illness in The Queen Victoria; firstly by telling them that he doesn't have AIDS but is HIV positive, which is a noncontagious virus, forcing them to acknowledge their bigotry. Peggy remains uncertain, but is forced to realise that Mark might appreciate a bit of support when she is diagnosed with breast cancer.|$|E
