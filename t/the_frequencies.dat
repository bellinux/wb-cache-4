5|$|Optical {{heterodyne}} detection {{is an essential}} technique used in high-accuracy measurements of <b>the</b> <b>frequencies</b> of optical sources, {{as well as in}} the stabilization of their frequencies. Until a relatively few years ago, lengthy frequency chains were needed to connect the microwave frequency of a cesium or other atomic time source to optical frequencies. At each step of the chain, a frequency multiplier would be used to produce a harmonic of the frequency of that step, which would be compared by {{heterodyne detection}} with the next step (the output of a microwave source, far infrared laser, infrared laser, or visible laser). Each measurement of a single spectral line required several years of effort in the construction of a custom frequency chain. Currently, optical frequency combs have provided a much simpler method of measuring optical frequencies. If a mode-locked laser is modulated to form a train of pulses, its spectrum is seen to consist of the carrier frequency surrounded by a closely spaced comb of optical sideband frequencies with a spacing equal to the pulse repetition frequency (Fig.16). The pulse repetition frequency is locked to that of the frequency standard, and <b>the</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the comb elements at the red end of the spectrum are doubled and heterodyned with <b>the</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the comb elements at the blue end of the spectrum, thus allowing the comb to serve as its own reference. In this manner, locking of the frequency comb output to an atomic standard can be performed in a single step. To measure an unknown frequency, the frequency comb output is dispersed into a spectrum. The unknown frequency is overlapped with the appropriate spectral segment of the comb and the frequency of the resultant heterodyne beats is measured.|$|E

5|$|Another {{brute force}} {{approach}} is to match up the frequency distribution of the letters. By graphing <b>the</b> <b>frequencies</b> of letters in the ciphertext, and by knowing the expected distribution of those letters in the original language of the plaintext, a human can easily spot {{the value of the}} shift by looking at the displacement of particular features of the graph. This is known as frequency analysis. For example, in the English language the plaintext frequencies of the letters E, T, (usually most frequent), and Q, Z (typically least frequent) are particularly distinctive. Computers can also do this by measuring how well the actual frequency distribution matches up with the expected distribution; for example, the chi-squared statistic can be used.|$|E

Electronic instruments create various colours of noise.

5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{will only}} cause evolution {{if there is}} enough genetic variation in a population. Before the discovery of Mendelian genetics, one common hypothesis was blending inheritance.

The Hardy–Weinberg principle provides the solution to how variation is maintained in a population with Mendelian inheritance. <b>The</b> <b>frequencies</b> of alleles (variations in a gene) will remain constant {{in the absence of}} selection, mutation, migration and genetic drift.|$|E
50|$|<b>Frequency</b> space: <b>The</b> <b>frequency</b> {{range of}} <b>the</b> search space is the band where the signal may be located given the {{receiver}} knowledge. <b>The</b> carrier <b>frequency</b> varies by roughly 5 kHz {{due to the}} Doppler effect when the receiver is stationary; if the receiver moves, the variation is higher. <b>The</b> code <b>frequency</b> deviation is 1/1,540 times <b>the</b> carrier <b>frequency</b> deviation for L1 because <b>the</b> code <b>frequency</b> is 1/1,540 of <b>the</b> carrier <b>frequency</b> (see § Frequencies used by GPS). The down conversion does not affect <b>the</b> <b>frequency</b> deviation; it only shifts all <b>the</b> signal <b>frequency</b> components down.

5|$|Northeast Pacific {{resident}} groups {{tend to be}} {{much more}} vocal than transient groups in the same waters.

In contrast, the marine mammal prey of transients hear well underwater at <b>the</b> <b>frequencies</b> used in killer whale calls. As such, transients are typically silent, probably to avoid alerting their mammalian prey. They sometimes use a single click (called a cryptic click) rather than the long train of clicks observed in other populations. Residents are only silent when resting.|$|E
5|$|The fixed {{reed and}} fairly uniform {{diameter}} of the clarinet give the instrument an acoustical behavior approximating that of a cylindrical stopped pipe. Recorders use a tapered internal bore to overblow at the octave when the thumb/register hole is pinched open, while the clarinet, with its cylindrical bore, overblows at the 12th. Adjusting {{the angle of the}} bore taper controls <b>the</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the overblown notes (harmonics). Changing the mouthpiece's tip opening and the length of the reed changes aspects of the harmonic timbre or voice of the clarinet because this changes the speed of reed vibrations. Generally, the goal of the clarinetist when producing a sound is to make as much of the reed vibrate as possible, making the sound fuller, warmer, and potentially louder.|$|E

Hopping with the head facing up and downward are observed to be statistically associated with <b>the</b> <b>frequencies</b> of a bird's joining and finding, respectively. When the expected stable frequency of the scrounger tactic was altered by changing the availability of seeds, the relative frequency of hopping with the head up changed accordingly.

5|$|Transversal {{filters are}} not usually {{associated}} with passive implementations but the concept {{can be found in}} a Wiener and Lee patent from 1935 which describes a filter consisting of a cascade of all-pass sections. The outputs of the various sections are summed in the proportions needed to result in the required frequency function. This works by the principle that certain frequencies will be in, or close to antiphase, at different sections and will tend to cancel when added. These are <b>the</b> <b>frequencies</b> rejected by the filter and can produce filters with very sharp cut-offs. This approach did not find any immediate applications, and is not common in passive filters. However, the principle finds many applications as an active delay line implementation for wide band discrete-time filter applications such as television, radar and high-speed data transmission.|$|E
5|$|While natural {{selection}} has a direction, guiding evolution towards heritable adaptations {{to the current}} environment, genetic drift has no direction and is guided only by the mathematics of chance.
