5|$|A {{statutory}} {{board is}} an autonomous agency of <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>that</b> is established by an Act of Parliament and overseen {{by a government}} ministry.

5|$|In January 2005, the US101 was {{selected}} for the VXX Presidential Helicopter Replacement Program, and was promptly re-designated as the VH-71. However, development was subject to delays, cost overruns, and engineering issues; Lockheed attributed much of these issues to unanticipated and extensive modifications being demanded by <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>that</b> had been absent from the request for proposal (RFP) issued. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report in 2011 also recognised {{that a lack of}} flexibility and compromise {{on the part of the}} government had negatively impacted the programme. By late 2008, the cancellation of the VH-71 was looking increasingly likely.|$|E
5|$|Jordan is {{a unitary}} state under a {{constitutional}} monarchy. Jordan's constitution, adopted in 1952 and amended {{a number of}} times since, is the legal framework that governs the monarch, government, bicameral legislature and judiciary. The king retains wide executive and legislative powers from the government and parliament. The king exercises his powers through <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>that</b> he appoints for a four-year term, which is responsible before the parliament that is made up of two chambers: the Senate and the House of Representatives. The judiciary is independent according to the constitution.|$|E
5|$|Norman {{government}} under William {{was similar to}} <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>that</b> had existed under earlier dukes. It was a fairly simple administrative system, built around the ducal household, which consisted {{of a group of}} officers including stewards, butlers, and marshalls. The duke travelled constantly around the duchy, confirming charters and collecting revenues. Most of the income came from the ducal lands, as well as from tolls and a few taxes. This income was collected by the chamber, one of the household departments.|$|E

5|$|The {{need for}} an {{integrated}} command structure received more emphasis {{as a result of}} the inefficient arrangements which at times hindered the military's efforts during the Vietnam War. In 1973, the Secretary of the Department of Defence, Arthur Tange, submitted a report to <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>that</b> recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service into a single Department of Defence and the creation of the post of Chief of the Defence Force Staff. The government accepted these recommendations and the Australian Defence Force was established on 9 February 1976.|$|E
5|$|A {{major source}} of income was the export of wool. However, the fourteenth century saw a change in fortunes: the Black Death, a {{worsening}} economic climate and poor administration left the abbey (like many others of its order) with sharply declining numbers of monks and saddled with major debt. The internal discipline and morals of the community declined too: in 1400–01 it was reported to <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>that</b> the abbot of Cleeve and three other monks were leading a group of 200 bandits and attacking travellers in the region. However, things improved {{in the fifteenth century}} and despite the vast expense caused by the extravagant building projects of the last abbots, better management, access to new resources (for instance from the profits from the right to hold markets granted by the crown) and a general improvement in the circumstances facing the house meant that just prior to the dissolution Cleeve was enjoying an Indian Summer of comfortable stability.|$|E

5000|$|Two {{arguments}} were presented by <b>the</b> <b>government</b> {{in opposition to}} these restrictions.

[...] Alternatively, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> argued <b>that</b> even if the [...] "primary purpose" [...] limitation exists, {{the passage of the}} Patriot Act eliminated that concept from FISA. As a corollary, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> restrictions imposed by the FISC below were a misconstruction of the FISA provisions and [...] "an end run around" [...] the amendments added by the Patriot Act.|$|R
5|$|A {{statutory}} {{board is}} an autonomous agency of <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>that</b> is established by an Act of Parliament and overseen {{by a government}} ministry. The Act sets out the purposes, powers and rights of the agency. Unlike ministries and government departments that are subdivisions of ministries, statutory boards may not be staffed by civil servants and have greater independence and flexibility in their operations. They are managed by boards of directors whose members usually include businessmen, professionals, senior civil servants and officials of trade unions. The Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), the Central Provident Fund Board (CPF), the Housing and Development Board (HDB), the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS), the Land Transport Authority (LTA), the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), the National Heritage Board (NHB), and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) are all statutory boards.|$|E
5|$|Abandoned or rebellious villages were {{destroyed}} by Ibrahim Pasha's troops, which prevented their inhabitants from returning. Ibrahim's army razed 16 villages before taking Nablus. He also forced {{the heads of the}} Nablus clans to leave for nearby villages. The absence of the traditional local leadership due to exile or execution left Palestine's urban population to be financially exploited by both the government and its local opponents. The imprisoned headmen of villages were replaced by their sons, although Ibrahim Pasha demoted them as nawatir (watchmen) instead of the higher-ranking title of mukhtar. Qasim's son Mahmud replaced him and the popularity of his father among the peasantry compelled the rural chiefs of Jabal Nablus to request from <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>that</b> Mahmud replace Sulaiman Abd al-Hadi as mutasallim of Nablus.|$|E
5|$|After unrelenting {{political}} pressure from Adolf Hitler, Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact on 25 March 1941. On 27 March, {{a military coup}} d'état overthrew <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>that</b> had signed the pact, and a new government was formed under {{the commander of the}} VVKJ, Armijski đeneral Dušan Simović. A general mobilisation was not initiated by the new government until 3 April 1941, out of fear of offending Hitler and thus precipitating war. However, on the same day as the coup, Hitler issued Führer Directive 25 which called for Yugoslavia to be treated as a hostile state, and on 3 April, Führer Directive 26 was issued, detailing the plan of attack and command structure for the German-led Axis invasion.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{importance}} of 'joint' warfare had been highlighted during Second World War when Australian naval, ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands, {{the absence of a}} central authority continued to result in poor co-ordination between the services in the post-war era, with each organising and operating {{on the basis of a}} different military doctrine. The need for an integrated command structure received more emphasis during the Australian military's experiences in the Vietnam War. In 1973, the Secretary of the Department of Defence, Arthur Tange, submitted a report to <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>that</b> recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service into a single department and the creation of the post of Chief of the Defence Force Staff.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} January 2007, the {{government}} declared it would postpone the demolition of Queen's Pier until a consensus could be reached on the course of action; consultations with the Hong Kong Institute of Architects, the Hong Kong Institute of Engineers, and the Conservancy Association were held. The Institute of Architects, whose members opposed dismantling the pier, originally maintained the pier should remain untouched. However, {{it was reported that}} after meeting {{the government}}, the Institute and the Conservancy Association were persuaded by <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>that</b> the pier could first be dismantled, and then reassembled at another location after completion of the reclamation. This change of heart was heavily criticised by Winston Chu, founder of the Society for Protection of the Harbour. The HKIA clarified that their opposition had not in fact changed.|$|E

5|$|Biko and SASO were openly {{critical}} of NUSAS' protests against government policies. Biko argued that NUSAS merely sought {{to influence the}} white electorate; in his opinion, this electorate was not legitimate, and protests targeting a particular policy would be ineffective for the ultimate aim of dismantling the apartheid state. SASO regarded student marches, pickets, and strikes to be ineffective and stated it would withdraw from public forms of protest. It deliberately avoided open confrontation with the state until such a point when it had a sufficiently large institutional structure. Instead, SASO's focus was on establishing community projects and spreading Black Consciousness ideas among other black organisations and the wider black community. Despite this policy, in May 1972 it issued the Alice Declaration, in which it called for students to boycott lectures {{in response to the}} expulsion of SASO member Abram Onkgopotse Tiro from the University of the North after he made a speech criticising its administration. The Tiro incident convinced <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>that</b> SASO was a threat.|$|E
5|$|By 21 July 1914, the British had {{postponed}} {{delivery of}} Reşadiye and Sultan Osman-ı Evvel as tensions flared in Europe following {{the assassination of}} Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28 June. This action prompted a protest by Djemal Pasha, the Ottoman naval minister, via France, {{in the hopes of}} securing the ships' delivery. A transport ship carrying crews for the two battleships departed Constantinople on 4 August, only to be recalled on 7 August after the Ottoman government was informed that the dreadnoughts would not be delivered. First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill ordered the Royal Navy to detain the two ships on 29 July and prevent Ottoman naval personnel from boarding them; two days later, British sailors boarded the ships and formally seized them. Since Britain was not yet at war, these actions were illegal; the British government nevertheless determined to present the Ottomans with a fait accompli. On 3 August, the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire informed <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>that</b> Britain had seized the ships.|$|E
5|$|Districts {{established}} under U.S. {{federal guidelines}} generally {{begin the process}} of designation through a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the official recognition by the U.S. government of cultural resources worthy of preservation. While designation through the National Register does offer a district or property some protections, it is only in cases where the threatening action involves the federal government. If the federal government is not involved, then the listing on the National Register provides the site, property or district no protections. For example, if company A wants to tear down the hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the federal designation would offer no protections. If, however, company A was under federal contract the Smith House would be protected. A federal designation is little more than recognition by <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>that</b> the resource is worthy of preservation.|$|E
