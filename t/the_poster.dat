5|$|The promotional cinema {{poster for}} the film {{featured}} a woman holding a crossbow; she was photographed from behind, and her outfit left {{the bottom half of}} her buttocks exposed. The effect was achieved by having the model wear a pair of bikini bottoms backwards, so that the part seen on her backside is actually the front of the suit. <b>The</b> <b>poster</b> caused some furore—largely in the US—with The Boston Globe and the Los Angeles Times considering <b>the</b> <b>poster</b> so unsuitable they edited out everything above the knee, whilst the Pittsburgh Press editors painted a pair of shorts over the legs. There was significant speculation as to the identity of the model before photographer Morgan Kane identified her as Joyce Bartle.|$|E

40|$|This article aims {{to analyze}} a corpus formed by sample of <b>posters</b> used in <b>the</b> Brazilian protests, called "Passe Livre”, in 2013. Our study intents {{understand}} <b>the</b> <b>posters</b> under <b>the</b> multi-systemic perspective (Castilho, 2010). <b>The</b> <b>posters</b> are {{a kind of}} textual genre (Bakhtin, 2011). This work explores the mutual interactions between the language and the social facts, performing quantitative analysis of <b>the</b> <b>posters</b> at various levels (from the lexical to the pragmatic-discursive level). Our methodological pillars are the concepts of habitus and linguistic market (Bourdieu, 2003) and the concept of “liquid modernity” (Bauman, 2001). Our analysis showed that: 1) the most common theme of <b>the</b> <b>posters</b> refer to <b>the</b> act of protest, 2) only 40 % of <b>the</b> <b>posters</b> are argumentative or injunctive texts, 3) <b>the</b> <b>posters</b> have, in general, only once sentence, 4) in low frequency, <b>the</b> <b>posters</b> have elements of the non-verbal languages, 5) <b>the</b> <b>posters</b> have, more often, simple phrases period, 6) imperative verbs are rare on those posters, and, finally, 7) most of <b>the</b> <b>posters</b> are for declaring something and do another reflect, but not to demand something. All these features indicate that posters have a relationship with the texts of social networks, to which are connected in real time, and are a linguistic product of the generation that has in your habitus the rules of the "liquid modernity"...|$|R

The film's trailer was nominated for a Golden Trailer award, recognizing achievements in marketing. On March 27, 2012, it was reported that 20th Century Fox had <b>the</b> <b>poster</b> and trailer removed from Florida theaters in response to increasing controversy surrounding the February shooting death of Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida by neighborhood-watch captain George Zimmerman. The trailer featured Hill imitating a gun with his hand pretending to shoot at teenagers, while <b>the</b> <b>poster</b> featured a bullet-ridden, alien-themed neighborhood-watch sign.

5|$|The {{front of}} the single's US picture sleeve {{consisted}} of a photo of Harrison playing guitar inside the central tower of his recently purchased home, Friar Park, in Henley-on-Thames. The tower's sole, octagonal-shaped room was an area that Harrison had adopted as his personal temple and meditation space. This picture was taken by photographer Barry Feinstein, whose Camouflage Productions partner, Tom Wilkes, originally used {{it as part of}} an elaborate poster intended as an insert in the album package. <b>The</b> <b>poster</b> featured a painting of the Hindu deity Krishna watching a group of naked maidens beside a bathing pond. Harrison apparently felt uncomfortable with the symbolism in Wilkes's design – the Friar Park tower image filled the top half of <b>the</b> <b>poster,</b> floating among clouds above the Krishna scene – so Wilkes abandoned the concept and instead used a darkened photo of Harrison inside the house as the album poster. The more common picture sleeve internationally was a close-up of Feinstein's All Things Must Pass front-cover image, taken on the main lawn of Friar Park. In Denmark, the sleeve featured four shots of Harrison, again with guitar, taken on stage during the Delaney & Bonnie tour.|$|E
