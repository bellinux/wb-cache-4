50|$|The {{advantage}} of software upgradeability was diminished when many newer hardware modems gained the ability <b>to</b> upgrade <b>firmware</b> <b>to</b> support new standards. Modems {{such as those}} made by U.S. Robotics used generic DSP architecture, which achieves the flexibility of softmodems, without sacrificing compatibility.|$|R
50|$|OTA {{is similar}} <b>to</b> <b>firmware</b> {{distribution}} methods used by other mass-produced consumer electronics, such as cable modems, which use TFTP {{as a way}} to remotely receive new programming, thus reducing {{the amount of time spent}} by both the owner and the user of the device on maintenance.|$|E
50|$|RPC-1 and RPC-2 are designations applied <b>to</b> <b>firmware</b> for DVD drives. Older DVD drives use RPC-1 firmware, {{which allows}} DVDs from any region to play. Newer drives use RPC-2 firmware, which enforces DVD region coding at the {{hardware}} level. See DVD region code#Computer DVD drives for further information.|$|E
50|$|There {{are some}} {{proprietary}} systems incompatible with standard AGP; for example, Apple Power Macintosh computers with the Apple Display Connector (ADC) {{have an extra}} connector which delivers power to the attached display.

The 8164(f) also offers built-in two QSFP+ 40Gb ports. All the PCT8100 models have one expansion slot allowing to insert a dual QSFP+ port for two 40Gb interfaces or -with a break-out cable- 2 x 4 x SFP+ 10Gbit/s ports Once you update a PCT8100 <b>to</b> <b>firmware</b> level 6.0 or later it is renamed to N4000 model.|$|E
50|$|The term BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) refers <b>to</b> <b>firmware</b> that initialises {{computer}} hardware and has provisions to load an operating system. The BIOS also {{sets up a}} standard interface for several low-level device drivers at boot time. BIOS resources are often used by hobbyist operating systems, especially those written on 16-bit x86 machines, as many hobby operating systems developers lack the time to write complex low level drivers themselves or they simply {{want to get into}} writing software for the system as soon as possible.|$|E
50|$|By contrast, in-band {{management}} like VNC, SSH, or even Serial port {{is based}} on in-band connectivity and software that must be installed on the remote system being managed and only works after the operating system has been booted. This solution may be cheaper, but in computing it does not allow access <b>to</b> <b>firmware</b> (BIOS or UEFI) settings, {{does not make it}} possible to reinstall the operating system remotely, and it cannot be used to fix problems that prevent the system from booting. In networking, it does not allow management of remote network components independently of the current status of other network components.|$|E
50|$|Flashing <b>to</b> {{upgrade the}} <b>firmware</b> {{can be taken}} {{advantage}} of as {{it does not seem}} to check if the version that is being installed is older. Due <b>to</b> this, using <b>firmware</b> made by the other vendors on the model each sold in particular is possible.|$|R

Internet sites may be located offshore in countries where local laws permit the information and software to be distributed openly; some of the more notorious software distributed to pirates ranges from NagraEdit (a program intended to edit the information stored on Swiss-designed Kudelski NagraVision 1 smartcards) <b>to</b> <b>firmware</b> which may be used to reprogram some free-to-air set-top boxes or desktop PCs equipped with Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) tuner cards to permit them to decode encrypted broadcasts.|$|E
5000|$|Rogers' {{criterion}} for whether a voting machine {{is a black}} box is strict—you {{must be able to}} sense that it works correctly as you use it. A somewhat weaker criterion is sometimes accepted, based on whether the public is allowed to examine the mechanism, in a modern context, both the source code and hardware. Though source code may be available to voting system testing authorities and state or county election officials it can still be considered [...] "black box" [...] if it is not available to the public. Even with some open source systems, which allow examination of the source code, access <b>to</b> <b>firmware,</b> which controls the hardware, is not available.|$|E
5000|$|Booting is {{the process}} of {{starting}} a computer, specifically with regard to starting its software. The process involves a chain of stages, in which at each stage a smaller, simpler program loads and then executes the larger, more complicated program of the next stage. It is in this sense that the computer [...] "pulls itself up by its bootstraps", i.e. it improves itself by its own efforts. Booting is a chain of events that starts with execution of hardware-based procedures and may then hand-off <b>to</b> <b>firmware</b> and software which is loaded into main memory. Booting often involves processes such as performing self-tests, loading configuration settings, loading a BIOS, resident monitors, a hypervisor, an operating system, or utility software.|$|E
