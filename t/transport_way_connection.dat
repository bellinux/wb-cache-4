Optical fibers and lightguides play the key role in telecommunications because of constant demands of higher bandwidth and data rates.

There are various types of fibers and there are also many <b>ways</b> of <b>connections.</b> This work deals with demountable <b>way</b> of <b>connection</b> – optical connectors, which have the biggest influence on a total attenuation and route length.

40|$|Solutions {{of several}} {{problems}} can be modelled as solutions of nonsmooth equations. Then, Newton-type methods for solving such equations induce particular iteration steps (actions) and regularity requirements in the original problems. We study these actions and requirements for nonlinear complementarity problems (NCP’s) and Karush–Kuhn–Tucker systems (KKT) of optimization models. We demonstrate their dependence on the applied Newton techniques and the corresponding reformulations. In this <b>way,</b> <b>connections</b> to SQP-methods, to penalty-barrier methods and to general properties of so-called NCP-functions are shown. Moreover, direct comparisons of the hypotheses and actions {{in terms of the}} original problems become possible. Besides, we point out the possibilities and bounds of such methods in dependence of smoothness...|$|R

40|$|The {{degree to}} which a pure quantum state is {{entangled}} can be characterized by the distance or angle to the nearest unentangled state. This geometric measure of entanglement is explored for bi-partite and multi-partite pure and mixed states. It is determined analytically for arbitrary two-qubit mixed states, generalized Werner, and isotropic states, and is also applied to certain multi-partite mixed states, including two distinct multi-partite bound entangled states. Moreover, the ground-state entanglement of the XY model in a transverse field is calculated and shown to exhibit singular behavior near the quantum critical line. Along the <b>way,</b> <b>connections</b> are pointed out between the geometric measure of entanglement, the Hartree approximation, entanglement witnesses, correlation functions, and the relative entropy of entanglement...|$|R
