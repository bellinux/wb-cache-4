500|$|In July 2002, Wallwork {{moved on}} to West Bromwich Albion on a Bosman free transfer, {{becoming}} the first player signed by Albion following their promotion to the Premier League. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson called him the [...] "best Bosman of the summer". Before the season started, Wallwork and his Albion teammates {{were involved in a}} dispute over bonuses with the club's new board of directors. According to his agent, the player was said to be [...] "shocked and disturbed" [...] at the prospect of an 80% reduction in bonuses compared with that offered by the outgoing board. Wallwork made his Albion debut as a substitute in a 3–1 home defeat to Leeds United on 24 August, and he went on to play in 27 of Albion's 38 Premier League games in 2002–03. Following the death of his mother in February 2003, he and his teammates each wore a black armband for the match against Bolton Wanderers. The club was eventually relegated {{at the end of the}} campaign and Wallwork fell out of favour during 2003–04, taking part in just five league matches during the first half of the season. In January 2004, he joined Bradford City on an initial month-long loan, during which time he scored in his first and last games. Albion initially refused an extension to the loan, citing concerns over the financial situation at Bradford, who were on the verge of administration. A second loan deal for a further two months at Bradford was agreed shortly afterwards, and Wallwork scored a further two goals, taking his total with Bradford to four in seven games. He attributed his new-found goalscoring form to tactical instructions from manager Bryan Robson, who <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> forward more often, in contrast to his deeper-lying role at West Bromwich Albion. A broken toe sustained in a match against Rotherham United meant that he returned earlier than scheduled, however. While Wallwork was sidelined for six weeks, his West Bromwich Albion teammates secured promotion back to the Premier League at the first attempt.|$|E

When the Union army was retreating through town during the First Battle of Winchester, the civilians, but most particularly the women, uttered the vilest language, hurling at them anything that came to hand. Then they began shooting from their windows or yards. Any of a number of soldiers were killed by women firing at them. One cavalryman, wounded in the foot, sat on a doorstep. The woman of the house opened the door and asked him if he could walk. [...] "No," [...] he told her. Could she see his pistol she asked. Innocently, he gave it to her.

2500|$|Cosby {{was asked}} {{directly}} about Buress's comments {{and the resulting}} fallout in two November 2014 interviews, which were originally intended to be about a new art exhibit at the Smithsonian that featured his private collection of African American art. In an NPR interview on November 15, 2014, reporter Scott Simon said: [...] "This question gives me no pleasure, Mr. Cosby, {{but there have been}} serious allegations raised about you in recent days." [...] Cosby became silent, leading to an awkward radio exchange in which Simon verbally described Cosby's actions to listeners: [...] "you're shaking your head no." [...] Simon continued asking Cosby to comment on the allegations before finally wrapping up the interview with no further communication from Cosby. In a November 6, 2014, interview with Associated Press reporter Brett Zongker, Cosby appeared visibly rattled by unexpected Buress questions and told Zongker, [...] "No, no, we don't answer that." [...] In the proceeding minutes, Cosby repeatedly attempted to get Zongker to confirm that the AP would edit out the Buress questions, implying that Zongker's [...] "integrity" [...] and ability to be a [...] "serious reporter" [...] would be compromised if that portion of the interview was not [...] "scuttled". When Zongker failed to guarantee this request, Cosby turned to his off-camera publicist David Brokaw and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on the phone with Zongker's editors [...] "immediately".

2500|$|The prosecution's {{strategy}} was to tie Surratt to the conspiracy. Powell's arrival at her boarding house, {{three days after the}} president's murder, was critical evidence against her, the government argued. The prosecution presented nine witnesses, but most of their case rested on the testimony of just two men: John M. Lloyd and Louis J. Weichmann. Lloyd testified on May 13 and 15, 1865 on the hiding of the carbines and other supplies at the tavern in March and the two conversations he had with her in which she <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the [...] "shooting irons" [...] ready. Weichmann's testimony was important, as it established an intimate relationship between her and the other conspirators. Weichmann testified May 16 to 19 and said that he had resided at the boarding house since November 1864. He had seen or overheard John, Jr., meeting and talking with Atzerodt, Booth, and Powell many times over the past four and a half months. Weichmann had driven Surratt to the tavern on April 11 and April 14, confirmed that she and Lloyd had spent much time in private conversation, testified that he saw Booth give her the package of binoculars, and attested that she had turned the package over to Lloyd. Weichmann also testified at length about the Surratt family's ties to the Confederate spy and courier rings operating in the area and their relationships with Atzerodt and Powell. He also testified about the December 23 meeting with Booth and John (which he also attended) and their subsequent meeting with Booth at Booth's room at the National Hotel. Finally, he told the military tribunal about the general excitement in the boarding house in March 1865 after the failed attempt to kidnap Lincoln.|$|E

Yanez said: [...] "I thought, I was gonna die, and I thought if he's, if he has the, the guts and the audacity to smoke marijuana in front of the five-year-old girl and risk her lungs and risk her life by giving her secondhand smoke and the front seat passenger doing the same thing, then what, what care does he give about me?"

2500|$|In [...] "Take Out," [...] Don {{must see}} a {{therapist}} who is {{led to believe}} that he is [...] "trigger happy." [...] His father noted that this may be true, as he often shoots first. Further, Alan recalled how Don would take on others' burdens as a child and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> counseling, which he later willingly sought, especially considering that he viewed his life's work as a series of dirty deeds. In [...] "One Hour", Don expressed that he doesn't have to trust his team, they have to trust him. [...] The exception to this may be Charlie, whom the therapist identified {{as a member of the}} team to Don's initial confusion. [...] It appears that Don considers Charlie more of an extension of himself than a member of his team, which may be true: [...] Charlie would likely not be involved in the volume of cases that he is if not for Don's continued requests for his assistance, despite the team's respect for Charlie's contributions. He also confessed to his psychiatrist that he [...] "respects the Hell out of" [...] Charlie for all that his brother does for the FBI, and that Charlie has never let them down despite often having the team's and Don's lives in his hands. When the psychiatrist pushes Don about his relationship with Charlie, indicating first that Don resents Charlie's presence at the FBI and then that Don enjoys having his little brother as his 'employee', Don vehemently snaps back and defends Charlie. This shows how far the relationship between the brothers has come, especially since being damaged by the unusual pressures of their childhood and the three months near the end of their mother's life that Charlie spent working on P vs. NP. The therapist reveals that Don has deep-seated fears of losing what he has worked for, together with self-esteem issues from growing up in Charlie's shadow and likely some abandonment issues as well. In [...] "Money for Nothing", he acquiesces to the counselor's request to ask Charlie to come in for a visit. A looming issue was the day Charlie walked all the way home from a camping trip at the age of 8 (taken for Don's 13th birthday) just to get away from Don who did not want him sticking around. During the meeting, he learns that his brother was not as inept as he and his father thought and stated he likes working with Charlie. Both Don's therapist and Edgerton himself bring up the incident in which a suspect was tortured that nearly took Don over the edge ("One Hour" [...] and [...] "Pandora's Box"), but given the fact that it was done to obtain the whereabouts of a missing FBI agent, Don and Ian's superiors appear to be overlooking the matter for now.|$|E
