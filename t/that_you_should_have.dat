25|$|Rogers {{was born}} into a cricketing family and his dad must take credit for his technique. He is {{actually}} a natural right-hander but his father felt <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> the stronger hand {{at the top of the}} handle and he switched him around. Rogers attended Brydon Country School and played in their 1st Eleven as an allrounder along with Sean Ervine. His secondary education was at St. John's College where he was captain of the first eleven.|$|E
500|$|Rater {{noted that}} the balance Meredith had just found in her life, finally having a chance at {{happiness}} with the man she loves, is shaken by her mother's unexpected lucidity, which was stated to have been written in the series in order to remind Meredith about the troubled years of her growing up: [...] "If Meredith {{is ever going to}} be happy, she's got to {{deal with the fact that}} she had a really terrible childhood." [...] In addition, Rater explained that Ellis' [...] "awful, raw, ugly and terrible" [...] statements towards her daughter were intended to make everyone realize the reason behind Meredith's alcoholism in college and her continuous one-night stands with inappropriate men. She also deemed Pompeo's performance in the episode [...] "exceptional", describing what she regarded an [...] "exceptional moment" [...] which sees Meredith stand up to her mother. In response to the scene that sees Ellis interacting with Webber, Rater wrote that it is the first time she lets her guard down, exposing the previously hidden vulnerability, which allows her express the desire to be as happy and ordinary as her daughter. She also praised the performances of the cast, by deeming their acting [...] "remarkable". [...] "That is really what it's all about. We have to cherish the time that we have here, and love the people who surround and support us, even if they make us crazy, because things happen. Brain surgery, Alzheimer's and weddings. And the worst thing is to come to the end of your life, and realize, like Ellis, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> tried harder", stated Rater, putting the emphasis on the main aspects of the episode, characterizing it as [...] "not ordinary".|$|E

2500|$|Also in 2000, Straw {{turned down}} an asylum request from a man fleeing Saddam Hussein's regime, stating [...] "we {{have faith in the}} {{integrity}} of the Iraqi judicial process and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> no concerns if you haven’t done anything wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{know you}} need funds. We {{understand}} that and our opinion is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{the opportunity to}} rebuild your country. But we have no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with Kuwait. ... Frankly, we can only see that you have deployed massive troops in the south. Normally {{that would not be}} any of our business. But when this happens in the context of what you said on your national day, then when we read the details in the two letters of the Foreign Minister, then when we see the Iraqi point of view that the measures taken by the U.A.E. and Kuwait is, in the final analysis, parallel to military aggression against Iraq, then it would be reasonable for me to be concerned.|$|E

2500|$|Unable to make {{progress}} through arms, Salisbury turned to craft. [...] He bribed the Scotsman who guarded the principal entrance, advising {{him to leave the}} gate unlocked or to leave it in such a manner that the English could easily break in. [...] However, the Scotsman, though he took the Englishman’s money, reported the stratagem to Agnes, so she was ready for the English when they made entry. [...] Though Salisbury was in the lead, one of his men pushed past him just at the moment when Agnes’s men lowered the portcullis, separating him from the others. [...] Agnes, of course, had meant to trap Salisbury, but she moved from stratagem to taunt, hollering at the earl, [...] " [...] Farewell, Montague, I intended <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> supped with us, and assist us in defending the Castle against the English." ...|$|E
2500|$|Irina's pleas were in vain. Her {{husband and}} his co-conspirators went {{forward with the}} plan without her. After the killing, Nicolas exiled both Yusupov and Dmitri Pavlovich. Felix was exiled to Rakitnoye, a remote country estate in the Rakityansky District that had been owned by the family since 1729. Dmitri was exiled to the Persian front with the army. Sixteen {{members of the family}} signed a letter asking the Tsar to reconsider his {{decision}} due to Dmitri's weak health, but Nicholas II refused to consider the petition. [...] "Nobody has the right to kill on his own private judgment," [...] wrote Nicholas II. [...] "I know that there are many others besides Dmitri Pavlovich whose consciences give them no rest, because they are compromised. I am astonished <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> applied to me." [...] Irina's father, [...] "Sandro", visited the couple at Rakitnoye in February 1917 and found their mood [...] "buoyant, but militant." ...|$|E
