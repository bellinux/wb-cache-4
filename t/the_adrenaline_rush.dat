5|$|Miss Rosa meets new {{prison inmate}} Piper and offers her some advice. She reveals {{that she is}} {{suffering}} from cancer and undergoing chemotherapy. Miss Rosa is told that she needs an operation to improve her chances of survival. However the DOC refuse to fund the operation and she is told {{that she needs to}} keep having chemotherapy. The outcome of which means she is likely to die. She then reminisces about her past as bank robber in which all the men she kissed during heists ended up dead. She details her life to a fellow cancer patient Yusef and they bond. He decides to help her regain <b>the</b> <b>adrenaline</b> <b>rush</b> felt from robbery and they steal a nurse's purse. Miss Rosa is delighted to learn that Yusef has gone into remission but is sad to say goodbye. She returns to her cell and informs good friend Anita DeMarco (Lin Tucci) that she is dying before smelling the money she stole from the nurse.|$|E

She regards herself as a pacifist and refuses to participate in any activities where she {{will be required to}} directly take a life. Despite this she is convinced that what the group is doing is right and enjoys <b>the</b> <b>adrenaline</b> <b>rush</b> that being in dangerous situations gives her.|$|E
25|$|It {{appears that}} paruresis {{involves}} a tightening of the sphincter and/or bladder neck {{due to a}} sympathetic nervous system response. <b>The</b> <b>adrenaline</b> <b>rush</b> that produces the involuntary nervous system response probably has peripheral and central nervous system involvement. The internal urethral sphincter (smooth muscle tissue) or the external urethral sphincter (striated muscle), levator ani (especially the pubococcygeus) muscle area, {{or some combination of}} the above, may be involved. It is possible that there is an inhibition of the detrusor command through a reflex pathway as well. The pontine micturition center (Barrington's nucleus) also may be involved, as its inhibition results in relaxation of the detrusor and prevents the relaxation of the internal sphincter.|$|E
50|$|There is a peak {{response}} to any emotional stimuli which usually occurs rapidly, usually out of shock, but last {{only as long}} as the stimuli is present.

50|$|Risk is {{stronger}} {{and faster than}} the average human, and his senses are more acute. His strength, speed and senses {{are said to be}} multiplied about six times the average human and up to ten times on occasions, however he has been observed punching through solid rock, tearing down concrete pillars, destroying a large robot in one kick and punching superboy through a building and large piece of construction equipment in one blow, so it appears his strength is either 6- 10 peak human strength or it has increased since last measured. He is hyper everything. <b>The</b> <b>adrenaline</b> <b>rushing</b> through his body makes him take a greater Risk each time.|$|R
500|$|Lois spanks Stewie while {{going through}} his [...] "it's mine" [...] phase, {{claiming}} everything in the house as his own.

500|$|... "Caught by the Fuzz" [...] {{was based}} on a real-life event: lead singer Gaz Coombes' arrest and caution for {{possession}} of cannabis at age fifteen. In a 2004 interview, Coombes said [...] "It wasn't trying to be a real statement, but at the time we knew that it was a big deal. Kids all around England were getting nicked for having a bit of hash on them. In Oxford that kind of thing happened quite a lot. It's all true so it was easy to write. It was a funny experience – not too funny at the time 'cause I was only 15 and shitting myself. The song has that disturbing energy. It's comparable to your heart racing. <b>The</b> <b>adrenaline</b> <b>rush</b> you get when your mum walks into the police station is similar to the energy of the song." ...|$|E
2500|$|In another {{interview}} Cedric elaborated on the kidnapping/vanishing themes, saying [...] "Lyrically, I {{wanted to}} incorporate elements of traditional songs. So {{that it would}} sound like our world had these handed down, traditional songs that were to do with real random vanishings and kidnappings. That {{is a big part}} of Latin culture. People get kidnapped all the time. I wanted to cover everything. Right from the exhilarating feeling you get when you put the ransom note down, <b>the</b> <b>adrenaline</b> <b>rush</b> when you realise a loved one has been taken from you, followed by that bleak, dismal area of not knowing what to do. Especially if you don't come from money. We had two friends that we knew from Texas who just randomly vanished. We've never known whether they just took off or if they met foul play. I found it an interesting subject matter to tackle. I wanted the lyrics to instil that bleak feeling you can get from living somewhere like El Paso. Even though I haven't lived at home for ages, it's still with me. The stories that come from across the border still hit home really hard. I just wanted to have a soundtrack for that really." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1976, Hayes Noel, Bob Gurnsey, and Charles Gaines {{discussed}} Gaines's {{recent trip}} to Africa and his experiences hunting African buffalo.

5000|$|Following the {{first-degree murder}} conviction, the {{prosecution}} was required to convince the jury that the murder was [...] "cruel, heinous, or depraved" [...] {{in order for them}} to determine that Arias was eligible for the death penalty. The aggravation phase of the trial started on May 15, 2013. The only witness was the medical examiner who performed the autopsy. Arias' attorneys, who had repeatedly asked to step down from the case, gave only brief opening statements and closing arguments, in which they said <b>the</b> <b>adrenaline</b> <b>rushing</b> through Alexander's body may have prevented him from feeling much pain during his death. Prosecutor Martinez showed photos of the corpse and crime scene to the jury, then paused for two minutes of silence to illustrate how long he said it took for Alexander to die at Arias' hands. After less than three hours of consideration, the jury determined that Arias was eligible for the death penalty.|$|R
2500|$|In Malcolm Gladwell's {{book on the}} {{cognitive}} function of snap judgments, Blink, well-known criminologist and police administrator James Fyfe said that Chicago police instructions in cases such as Russ's were [...] "very detailed." [...] He said that the record shows that the officers involved all broke procedure and let the situation become unnecessarily deadly for the suspect. For instance, after claiming to see Russ drive erratically, the officers engaged in a driving pursuit. The pursuit, labeled [...] "high-speed," [...] did not exceed 70 miles per hour, but Fyfe contends that <b>the</b> <b>adrenaline</b> <b>rush</b> of the chase, coupled with the officers reliance in their numbers, led to their ignoring impulses to maintain rational thinking in a potentially non-deadly situation. They speeded up a process that both allowed and required taking things more slowly and methodically. Russ's car spun out on the Ryan Expressway, at which point several officers quickly approached his vehicle. According to Gladwell, the false safety of numbers gave the three officers [...] "the bravado to rush the car." [...] Fyfe adds, [...] "The lawyers [...] were saying {{that this was a}} fast-breaking situation. But it was only fast-breaking because the cops let it become one. He was stopped. He wasn't going anywhere." ...|$|E

Her intoxication with <b>the</b> danger and <b>adrenaline</b> <b>rush</b> of working undercover conflicts with her supervisor's order to end {{the investigation}}. This endangers Cassie herself.|$|R
2500|$|Annie Zaleski of Las Vegas Weekly praised Night Visions {{for being}} [...] "well-crafted and wildly creative, and boasts solid songwriting—three {{things that are}} sorely missing on albums by so many younger bands." [...] Lisa Kwon of Consequence of Sound gave the album a mixed review and felt that Night Visions [...] "fails to match <b>the</b> fresh <b>adrenaline</b> <b>rush</b> that <b>the</b> band's first single had promised us when we first heard {{it on the radio}} or in {{commercials}} earlier this year." [...] Johan Wippsson from Melodic magazine called Night Visions [...] "somewhat shattered, but as a whole this is a very charming and well-crafted album." [...] Chris Saunders of musicOMH panned the album as [...] "so safe and middle of the road that it leaves you with the same hollow feeling that Las Vegas can, without the dizzying high and sensual assault that got you there in the first place." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jeffrey Bloomer of Slate favorably {{compared}} the film's [...] "genre maturity", [...] "amoral survivalism and malleable sense {{of good and}} evil", [...] "brutal efficiency" [...] and [...] "weary humor" [...] to John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13 and praised the cast, writing [...] "If the world knows any justice... then the Screen Actors Guild will remember this cast when it doles out its awards next year". James Berardinelli concludes the film is [...] "for anyone who enjoys sitting through 90 tense minutes and feeling <b>the</b> attendant <b>adrenaline</b> <b>rush.</b> It’s like a well-constructed horror movie" [...] that's [...] "As intimate as it is unnerving". Guy Lodge of Variety called it [...] "a technically sharp backwoods horror-thriller that lacks a human element". [...] Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that it's entertaining but [...] "less disciplined, less original and less memorable work than Blue Ruin".|$|R

50|$|After {{the release}} of Do or Die’s album, Traxster began working on Twista’s single “Emotions” for <b>the</b> album <b>Adrenaline</b> <b>Rush.</b> With <b>the</b> {{independent}} release of “Emotions” this rapidly selling single created a bidding war with the major labels. That bidding war birthed a deal with Atlantic Records, thus solidifying a history-making joint venture. The deal with Creator’s Way and the Atlantic was the biggest deal for an independent rap label and an established record company at that time. This allowed Traxster and the artists to have creative control over their projects. Traxster single-handedly produced, recorded, and mixed <b>Adrenaline</b> <b>Rush,</b> which is certified platinum. Soon after, Trax and his group, Shock The World, were also signed to Atlantic as recording artists, and was scheduled to release an album Blast For Me - A Thugs Religion in 1998. Due to financial and creative differences, the group split, and some members of Shock The World members decided to continue their career with Twista. This conflict led to the shelving of the group’s album and in 2002, Twista was released from Creator’s Way and was signed directly to Atlantic Records. The two reunited in 2005 to collaborate on the double-platinum record Kamikaze, but Traxster’s presence was missing from Twista’s following two albums.|$|R

Morgan shuts down the fights, but gains the resentment of his coworkers. When Jeff and Lester begin giving him trouble later, on Big Mike's advice, he singles out Lester and fires him in front of the other employees for his behavior. Lester begs him to reconsider, and with his authority now firmly established, relents and places him on [...] "double-secret" [...] probation.|$|R

5000|$|His {{fascination with}} speed skating started serendipitously, {{while on a}} {{roller-skate}} outing with his brother and father, {{at a young age}} of six in Gujan-Mestras Club. The three of them were amazed with the sight of [...] "in-line skate" [...] and for not quite a long joined Roller Skating Dijon Bourgogne Club. This acquainted him with the ice short track rink along with the short trackers, who used to join them during the latter summer trainings. The simple fun created by ice hockey games organized by the short trackers during Wednesday night, built good feeling with the new found team and influenced him to join the ice trainings. <b>The</b> new found <b>adrenaline</b> <b>rush</b> in speed skating immediately pushed aside the roller skating thrills.|$|R
5000|$|The show's {{production}} company, Endemol, {{describes the}} show as [...] "the play-along fun of a glitzy, Saturday night quiz with <b>the</b> full-on <b>adrenaline</b> <b>rush</b> of an extreme stunt show." [...] Each episode features eight contestants, {{with a mix of}} sexes, ages and backgrounds, competing to be the winner of the £10,000 prize in the UK version ($50,000 in the US version). Contestants are reduced one by one in the first four rounds, attempting to guess the correct answers to a selection of multiple-choice questions. The contestant who chooses the wrong answer will leave the show in spectacular fashion, in one of the 101 Ways To Leave A Gameshow. At any time during the first four rounds, a buzzer could sound, which announces the start of the Emergency Exit round. In this round, contestants are asked a series of questions at random, with the first contestant to give a wrong answer being eliminated. The Emergency Exit round is not used in the US and Italian versions. In the final round, only three contestants remain (four contestants in the US version), who have to answer one last question in an attempt to win the jackpot prize.|$|R
50|$|After World War II, countless {{veterans}} {{came back}} to America {{and many of them}} had a difficult time readjusting to civilian life. They searched for <b>the</b> adventure and <b>adrenaline</b> <b>rush</b> associated with life at war that had now left them. Civilian life felt too monotonous for some men who also craved feelings of excitement and danger. Others sought the close bonds and camaraderie found between men in the army. Furthermore, certain men wanted to combat their horrifying war memories and experiences that haunted them, many in the form of post-traumatic stress disorder. Thus, motorcycling emerged stronger than ever as a substitute for wartime experiences such as adventure, excitement, danger and camaraderie. Men who had {{been a part of the}} motorcycling world before the war were now joined by thousands of new members. The popularity of motorcycling grew dramatically after World War II because of the effects of the war on veterans.|$|R

50|$|If {{the shooter}} gets too excited, {{necessary}} concentration will be lost. Concentrating {{on the task}} at hand is more important than worrying or what ifs. <b>The</b> celebrating and <b>adrenaline</b> <b>rush</b> need to be kept in check. Professionalism needs to be kept right after the shot as well, in case a second shot is needed. Every hunter dreams of killing the target in one shot. Even if the shooter is confident that the target is mortally wounded, quickly reloading before checking to see if the animal has dropped can make the difference between possessing the target and having the target get away because of premature celebration. Practicing before the hunt or shooting match will hone or refresh marksmanship skills. Practicing from different positions can prepare the shooter for many of the situations that could arise. Every aspect of practice is important to performance in an actual situation.|$|R
