In preclinical studies utilizing patient xenografts, ABT-737 showed efficacy for treating lymphoma and other blood cancers. Because of its unfavorable pharmacologic properties ABT-737 is not appropriate for clinical trials, while its orally bioavailable derivative navitoclax (ABT-263) has similar activity on small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines and has entered clinical trials. While clinical responses with navitoclax were promising, mechanistic dose-limiting thrombocytopoenia was observed in patients under treatment due to Bcl-xL inhibition in platelets.|$|E
25|$|Antiandrogens {{that are}} {{currently}} on the market are particularly useful {{for the treatment of}} prostate cancer during the early stages. However, prostate cancer often progresses to a hormone-refractory state in which the cancer progresses in the presence of continued androgen ablation or antiandrogen therapy. This suggests that long term use of these antiandrogens during prostate cancer can lead to the development of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells or the ability of adrenal androgens to support tumor growth. This phenomenon is called antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome (AWS) {{and is one of the}} major drawbacks of existing antiandrogens. AWS is defined as <b>tumor</b> <b>regression</b> or symptomatic relief observed upon discontinuation of the antiandrogen therapy. The mechanism for this is not fully understood but current theories include alterations of the AR gene, coregulator proteins and/or signal transduction pathways. This antiandrogen resistance may also be linked to the relative weakness of current antiandrogens as they have an affinity 50 times or more lower than that of DHT for the AR. This may also explain why compensatory AR overexpression is often observed.|$|E
40|$|Many antigens {{recognized}} by autologous T lymphocytes {{have been identified}} on human melanoma. Melanoma patients usually mount a spontaneous T cell response against their tumor. But at some point, the responder T cells become ineffective, probably because of a local immunosuppressive process occurring at the tumor sites. Therapeutic vaccination of metastatic melanoma patients with these antigens is followed by <b>tumor</b> <b>regressions</b> only in {{a small minority of}} the patients. The T cell responses to the vaccines show correlation with the <b>tumor</b> <b>regressions.</b> The local immunosuppression may be the cause of the lack of vaccination effectiveness that is observed in most patients. In patients who do respond to the vaccine, the antivaccine T cells probably succeed in reversing focally this inummosuppression and trigger a broad activation of other antitumor T cells, which proceed to destroy the tumor...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the mechanisms whereby adoptively transferred murine CD 8 + lymphocytes mediate <b>tumor</b> <b>regressions.</b> Noncytolytic, CD 8 + tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) eradicated established lung tumors in irradiated mice. Many cytolytic and noncytolytic CD 8 + TIL cultures specifically secreted interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor when stimulated with tumor cells in vitro. The effectiveness of TIL when adoptively transferred to mice bearing micrometastases correlated better with their ability to specifically secrete lymphokines than with their cytotoxicity in vitro. In 14 of 15 tests, therapeutically effective TIL specifically secreted IFN-gamma in vitro, whereas only 1 of 11 ineffective TIL specifically secreted IFN-gamma. In contrast, only 8 of 15 therapeutically effective TIL were cytolytic. Antibodies to TNF inhibited the effectiveness of two adoptively transferred TIL cultures. In five experiments, antibodies to IFN-gamma abrogated the ability of four different CD 8 + TIL cultures to mediate <b>tumor</b> <b>regressions,</b> indicating that secretion of IFN-gamma {{is an essential part}} of the mechanism of action of TIL...|$|R
40|$|Significant <b>tumor</b> <b>regressions</b> {{have been}} {{observed}} in up to 70 % of patients receiving adoptively transferred autologous melanoma-reactive tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) 1, 2, and in pilot trials, 40 % of treated patients experienced complete regressions of all measurable lesions {{for at least five}} years following treatment 3. To evaluate the potential association between the ability of TIL to mediate durable regressions and their ability to recognize potent antigens that presumably include mutated gene products, a novel screening approach was developed that involved mining whole exome sequence data to identify the mutated proteins that were expressed in patient tumors. Candidate mutated T cell epitopes that were identified using an MHC binding algorithm 4 were then synthesized and evaluated for recognition by TIL. Using this approach, mutated antigens expressed on autologous tumor cells were identified as targets of three TIL that were associated with objective <b>tumor</b> <b>regressions</b> following adoptive transfer. This simplified approach, which avoids the need to generate and laboriously screen cDNA libraries from tumors, may represent a generally applicable method for identifying mutated T cell antigens expressed in melanoma as well as other tumor types...|$|R
25|$|Hydrazine sulfate was {{specifically}} {{developed as a}} result of a proposal by Joseph Gold for a therapy that could offset the rapid loss of weight that occurs in cancer (cancer cachexia). This hypothesis was based on the fact that cancer cells are often unusually dependent on glycolysis for energy (the Warburg effect), Gold proposed that the body might offset this increased glycolysis using gluconeogenesis, which is the pathway that is the reverse of glycolysis. Since this process would require a great deal of energy, Gold thought that inhibiting gluconeogenesis might reverse this energy requirement and be an effective treatment for cancer cachexia. Hydrazine is a reactive chemical that in the test tube can inactivate one of the enzymes needed for gluconeogenesis, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEP-CK). It was also postulated that if tumor energy gain (glycolysis) and host-energy loss (gluconeogenesis) were functionally interrelated, inhibition of gluconeogenesis at PEP CK could result in actual <b>tumor</b> <b>regression</b> in addition to reversal or arrest of cancer cachexia. In this model, hydrazine sulfate is therefore thought to act by irreversibly inhibiting the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to these results, an uncontrolled clinical trial was carried out at the Petrov Research Institute of Oncology in St. Petersburg {{over a period of}} 17 years, and a controlled trial was carried out at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in California over period of 10 years, respectively. The Russian trial reported complete <b>tumor</b> <b>regression</b> in about 1% of cases, a partial response in about 3% of cases and some subjective improvement of symptoms in about half of the patients. The National Cancer Institute analysis of this trial notes that interpretation of these data is difficult, due to the absence of controls, the lack of information on prior treatment and the study's reliance on subjective assessments of symptoms (i.e. asking patients if the drug had made them feel any better). Overall, the trials in California saw no statistically significant effect on survival from hydrazine sulfate treatment, but noted increased calorie intake in treated patients versus controls. The authors also performed a post-hoc analysis on one or more subgroups of these patients, which they reported as suggesting a beneficial effect from treatment. The design and interpretation of this trial, and in particular the validity of this subgroup analysis, was criticized in detail in an editorial in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.|$|E

50|$|In 1985 IL-2 {{administration}} produced durable <b>tumor</b> <b>regressions</b> in {{some patients}} with metastatic melanoma. Lymphocytes infiltrating the stroma of growing, transplantable tumors provided a concentrated source of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and could stimulate regression of established lung and liver tumors. In 1986, human TILs from resected melanomas were found to contain cells that could recognize autologous tumors. In 1988 autologous TILs were shown to reduce metastatic melanoma tumors. Tumor-derived TILs are generally mixtures of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells with few major contaminating cells.|$|R

2500|$|Later {{randomized}} controlled trials trials {{failed to find}} any improvement in survival, For example, in a trial of the treatment of advanced lung cancer, with either cisplatin and vinblastine or these drugs plus hydrazine sulfate, saw complete <b>tumor</b> <b>regression</b> in 4% of the hydrazine group, versus 3% in the control group, and tumor progression in 36% of the hydrazine group, versus 30% of the control group; however, none of these differences were statistically significant.

Although endogenous Ang- 2 cooperates with vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) to protect tumor endothelial cells, {{the effect on}} tumor vasculature of high levels of exogenous Ang- 2 with different levels of VEGF has not been studied in detail. Here, we report that systemic overexpression of Ang- 2 leads to unexpected massive <b>tumor</b> vessel <b>regression</b> within 24 It, even without concomitant inhibition of VEGF. By impairing pericyte coverage of the tumor vasculature, Ang- 2 destabilizes the tumor vascular bed while improving perfusion in surviving tumor vessels.

Although sustained systemic Ang- 2 overexpression does not affect tumor hypoxia and proliferation, it significantly inhibits tumor angiogenesis, promotes tumor apoptosis, and suppresses tumor growth.
