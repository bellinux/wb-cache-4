5|$|Feyenoord were {{paired with}} fellow Dutch side PSV Eindhoven in the quarter–finals, and the tie {{came down to}} a penalty shootout, which Feyenoord won 5–4. The first leg was drawn 1–1 with Feyenoord <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> in first half injury time through Pierre van Hooijdonk. PSV {{equalised}} two minutes after the restart when Mateja Kežman scored on 47 minutes. The second leg was again drawn 1–1, with PSV <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> on 75 minutes, when Mark van Bommel scored from outside the penalty area. That looked to have sent PSV into the semi-finals, but with seconds remaining, Van Hooijdonk scored from Johan Elmander's cross to send the tie into extra-time. PSV were reduced to ten men in extra time when Van Bommel was sent off for a second bookable offence but they still managed to hold out for the extra 30 minutes to force a penalty shootout.
