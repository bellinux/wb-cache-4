5|$|In March 1997, Michigan and the Big Ten {{released}} {{the results of}} an investigation of Martin's relationship with the school. The investigation determined that Martin had nurtured a relationship that involved some minor violations. <b>The</b> <b>violations</b> that were published were that Martin was present at a recruit's home during a visit by head coach Fisher; and he'd given a U-M player a birthday cake. Fisher prevented Martin from committing serious additional violations by keeping him from placing a deposit on an apartment for a player. He also stopped Martin from buying airplane tickets for another player's family. A second October 1997 private investigation also failed to reveal any large violations.|$|E
5|$|The University of Michigan {{basketball}} scandal or Ed Martin scandal was {{a series}} of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules violations that resulted in a six-year investigation {{of the relationship between the}} University of Michigan, its men's basketball program, and basketball team booster Ed Martin. As a result of the investigation, the Wolverine men's basketball program was punished with sanctions. <b>The</b> <b>violations</b> principally involved payments booster Martin made to several players to launder money from an illegal gambling operation. It is one of the largest incidents involving payments to college athletes in American collegiate history. An initial investigation by the school was joined by the NCAA, Big Ten Conference, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the United States Department of Justice (DOJ).|$|E

Both the Americans and the South Vietnamese lodged complaints to the International Control Commission about <b>the</b> <b>violations</b> of the Geneva Accords, but little action was taken. According to B. S. M. Murti, the Indian representative on the ICC, the communists did not try to stop the refugees at first, but increased their efforts over time as it became clearer that large proportions of the population wanted to emigrate.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman {{blockade}} quickly {{reduced the}} inhabitants to near starvation, and led {{many of them}} to flee the city. When coupled with the restrictions placed on them by the siege, the inability of Venice to properly supply and guard the city, and <b>the</b> <b>violations</b> of their customary rights and rampant profiteering by Venetian officials, a pro-surrender party was formed and gained strength among the inhabitants. The city's Metropolitan, Symeon, encouraged his flock to resist, but by 1426, with Venice's inability to secure peace {{on its own terms}} evident, a majority of the local population had come to prefer a surrender to avoid the pillage accompanying a forcible conquest. Venice's efforts to find allies against the Ottomans also failed, as the other regional potentates either pursued their own course, were themselves antagonistic to the Venetians, or were defeated by the Ottomans.|$|E
5|$|The {{logistics}} of the referendum were organised and supervised by Diệm's brother and confidant, Nhu, {{who was the}} leader of the family's secret Cần Lao party, which supplied the Ngôs' electoral base. Reports of violence and intimidation were widespread. During the referendum, Nhu's staff told voters to throw away the green ballots. Those who disobeyed were often chased down and beaten, with pepper sauce and water sometimes being forced into their nostrils. <b>The</b> <b>violations</b> were particularly flagrant in central Vietnam, a region over which another of Diệm's younger brothers, Ngô Đình Cẩn, ruled. Cẩn was based in the former imperial capital city of Huế, home of the Nguyễn Dynasty and a source of support for Bảo Đại. He stifled this support by ordering the police to arrest 1,200 people for political reasons in the week leading up to the vote. In the city of Hội An, several people were killed in election violence {{on the day of the}} poll. Voting started at 07:00 and ended at 17:00.|$|E

5|$|On Stevie's birthday, Naz {{arranges}} {{a dinner}} party for Stevie. Stevie's mother calls, asking her to carry out an errand but not mentioning her birthday. Naz sees a birthday card from when Stevie was thirteen and Stevie says {{it is the last}} card she received from her family. Naz tells her to forget her family. When Sol falls out with both Naz and Asher, Stevie tries to help resolve the problems. She and Sol go to a club where Stevie bumps into Pippa and they are more friendly. The next day, they wake up in bed together and Stevie tries to hide Pippa from her housemates. Olly bursts in saying he will have to let the flat go as he needs his deposit, but Stevie asks for one more day. Pippa writes Stevie a cheque to cover it, says {{she is one of the}} sexiest girls she has ever met, and asks her to call her, before leaving. Stevie gives Olly the deposit but he reveals he has already given notice and Stevie will have to move out the next day. Stevie visits her brother Rupert's grave before returning to the flat and making a list of safety violations. When her landlady Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) arrives, Stevie begs to stay, and says she will contact the council about <b>the</b> <b>violations,</b> so Roxy agrees. Stevie then invites Olly over, and he hopes to rekindle their relationship. However, she ties him naked to a chair, then humiliates him by making him walk home in a dress. She tells Masood they will have tea one day and kisses him before running off. The friends then all reunite and Stevie remarks that she loves a happy ending, saying they are now a happy family.|$|E

According to one commentator for The New York Times, this did not serve the purpose of the cameras, which were to educate drivers and keep the bus lanes empty of cars. The city agreed to review <b>the</b> <b>violations</b> and to keep each driver liable only for the first violation they received. There was a bus lane camera on Staten Island that gave tickets to drivers who failed to make an immediate right turn, even though {{it was not possible to}} make the right turn, since the next possible turn was a private driveway or a one-way street that had traffic running in the opposite direction. One retired police officer showed that his ticket was withheld by the judge and the appeals system. The city eventually turned off the camera.|$|E
40|$|Based on {{the general}} {{framework}} of randomness, introduced in [5], we analyze in mathematical terms the link between Bell’s inequality {{and the concept of}} ”local realism”.

In the most general settings, we formulate mathematically a condition on ”local realism” under a joint experiment. We derive quantum ”locally realistic ” inequalities, which show that the degree of <b>the</b> <b>violation</b> of Bell’s inequality in the quantum case is determined by the parameter, characterizing initial quantum entanglement. For given statistical data, the quantum ”locally realistic ” inequalities specify quantitative criteria for the degree of quantum entanglement.
