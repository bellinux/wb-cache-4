40|$|The {{anisotropic}} {{effects of}} random density irregularities in causing Faraday polarization fluctuations of VHF radio signals are examined, taking both rod-like and sheet-like irregularities into consideration. It is {{found that the}} variance of Faraday polarization fluctuations depends on the ratio of perpendicular to parallel correlation lengths. The anisotropic effect of rod-like ionospheric irregularities are shown to be most appreciable for longitudinal propagation. The anisotropic effect of sheet-like ionospheric irregularities, however, is not strongly dependent on the radio propagation angle. During <b>transionospheric</b> <b>propagation</b> at large angles {{with respect to the}} geomagnetic field, sheet-like irregularities may cause greater Faraday polarization fluctuations than rod-like irregularities...|$|E
40|$|The {{technique}} of modelling equatorial phase and amplitude scintillations from in-situ measurements of irregularity amplitude, ambient ionization density and irregularity power spectrum is outlined. The in-situ measurements do not directly {{provide information on}} irregularity layer thickness for which radar backscatter observations are utilized. The equatorial scintillation models developed from OGO- 6 and AE-C in-situ measurements during the two solstices are presented. Considerable differences in the longitude variation of scintillations are predicted during the two solstices. The model estimates are in good agreement with the available ground based phase and amplitude measurements.

Electron content statistics meet with an important difficulty: the majority of data stem from observations on the radio signals of orbiting satellites. The database for vertical electron content derived from observations of radio signals emitted from geostationary satellites is only very small. Therefore it is important to make use of statistics for peak density from ionosonde measurements. Quantile statistics do not contain information about ionization extremes.

40|$|Abstract:- The Earth’s {{ionosphere}} plays {{a crucial}} role in Global Positioning System (GPS) accuracy because this layer represents the largest source of positioning error for the users of the GPS after the turn-off of Selective Availability (SA). This paper studies the ionospheric effect on <b>transionospheric</b> signal <b>propagation</b> for the Earth-satellite path using 3 D Jones Ray-Tracing utilizing Nelder-Mead optimisation algorithm. The ionospheric delay or advance is obtained from the difference between the distance of the ray path from the satellite to the receiver determined from the ray-tracing and the distance for propagation over the line of sight (LOS) at the velocity of light in vacuum. The difference between the standard dual-frequency models corrected range and LOS, known as Residual Range Error (RRE) is calculated. Results show that the RRE of group delay value is different from RRE of phase advance. On the other hand, the group and phase path is longer when considering the geomagnetic field effect on both GPS frequencies L 1 and L 2. The higher order term in total electron content (TEC) calculation that relates to the refractive index is normally neglected due to its small value, but it is clearly shown that it does have some effects in ray-tracing. This analysis needs to be considered for more accurate GPS range finding...|$|R
40|$|VLF waves {{excited by}} {{powerful}} ground-based transmitters propagate in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide and leak through the ionosphere to the magnetosphere, {{where they are}} often recorded by satellites. Simulations of the propagation of whistler waves using coupled <b>transionospheric</b> VLF <b>propagation</b> and three-dimensional ray-tracing models have shown systematic overestimates of the VLF wavefield strength near 20 kHz in the magnetosphere by about 20 dB {{in the night and}} 10 dB during the day. The paper presents numerical simulations of the conversion between whistler and lower hybrid waves interactions in the presence of short-scale field-aligned density irregularities (striations) in Earth's lower ionosphere. The simulations, which incorporate a realistic ionospheric density profile, show that the mode conversion of whistler waves to lower hybrid waves leads to significant attenuation of whistler waves at altitudes between 90 and 150 km. The striation width {{plays an important role in}} the conversion efficiency between whistler and lower hybrid wave. Uniformly distributed striations with 8 m transverse size result in 15 dB attenuation in the 90 – 150 km propagation range, while a spectrum from 2 to 10 m results in 9 dB attenuation. It is argued that the attenuation of whistler waves in the presence of short-scale density striations in Earth's ionosphere can account for most of the observed ∼ 20 dB loss in VLF intensity. Furthermore, it predicts that VLF/ELF waves with frequencies below 5 kHz will not suffer similar attenuation...|$|R

Empirical relationships between the level of solar activity and the electron content have been developed permitting the prognostication of the electron content values. Marked discrepancies between prognostication and observation which occur during ionospheric storms are being studied to identify their causes. Electron content bite-outs during solar eclipses fall off with distance from totality more rapidly than simple theory predicts suggesting the action of eclipse induced neutral winds.

40|$|The {{observed}} polarisation of {{the horizontal}} magnetic components of whistler mode signals received at Halley, Antarctica (L≈ 4. 3), {{is in many}} cases that expected from a simple model of the <b>transionospheric</b> and sub-ionospheric <b>propagation</b> in the southern hemisphere; i. e. right-hand elliptical (field vectors rotate clockwise, looking towards the source) for ionospheric exit points close to the receiver, tending towards linear for more distant exit points. This suggests {{it may be possible}} to use the observed polarisation to estimate the propagation distance. However, in other cases, in certain frequency ranges, left-hand elliptically polarised signals have been observed. More realistic models do predict polarisation reversals at certain frequencies and exit point to receiver distances, but not over such a wide frequency range as has sometimes been observed. Also, in some cases, signals with nearly right-hand circular polarisation have been observed for exit points at large distances where linear polarisation would be expected...|$|R
30|$|The {{techniques}} {{based on}} the <b>transionospheric</b> radio waves <b>propagation,</b> in particular satellite navigation signals, are effectively used for monitoring and investigation of the main parameters of the ionospheric plasma irregularities. It is known that radio signals passing through the ionosphere suffer varying degrees of rapid variations of their amplitude and phase signal fluctuations, referred to as scintillations, created by random fluctuations of the medium’s refractive index, caused by plasma density gradients inside the ionosphere (e.g., Tsunoda et al. 1985; Basu et al. 1988; Aarons 1997; Prikryl et al. 2012). At high latitudes, these gradients are mostly caused by plasma processes associated with dynamic auroral processes, such as energetic particle precipitation and high-speed plasma convection (Keskinen and Ossakow 1983). Many researchers have used GPS signals to study ionospheric processes (e.g., Pi et al. 1997; Aarons and Lin 1999; Valladares et al. 2004; Jakowski et al. 2008, 2012; Tiwari et al. 2013; Prikryl et al. 2014; Cherniak and Zakharenkova 2015; van der Meeren et al. 2014; Jacobsen and Andalsvik 2016). Recently, Cherniak and Zakharenkova (2016 a) applied data of the GPS receivers onboard five low earth orbit satellites to examine the occurrence of the topside ionospheric irregularities under the geomagnetic storm conditions and to compare them with effects registered concurrently in the ground-based GPS data.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- GPS {{receivers}} {{have been}} profitably employed by researchers for investigations into ionospheric and atmospheric science. However, {{a number of}} improvements in measurement accuracy are necessary for today’s applications. The ionosphere has practical importance in GPS applications because it influences <b>transionospheric</b> radio wave <b>propagation.</b> Total Electron Content (TEC) {{is one of the}} parameters of the ionosphere that produces the most effects in many radio applications such as radio communications, navigation and space weather. Delays in GPS signals affect the accuracy of GPS positioning. The determination of the TEC will aid in reliable space-based navigation system. By modelling this TEC parameter, the evaluation of the ionospheric error and the correction of these ionospheric errors for differential GPS can be done. Determination of the differential ionospheric error to sub-centimetre accuracy is described in this paper utilizing a developed model. An ionospheric delay model was developed to accurately determine the difference in ionospheric delay expected over a short baseline so that a more accurate differential GPS correction could be made. An ionospheric error correction model should be made applicable to any location including the equatorial region. The results showed that the developed algorithm is a function of elevation angle and TEC from the referenc...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a {{relatively}} new tool for studying the ionosphere. This satellite system's original and continuing purpose is four dimensional radionavigation based on one way ranging. The radio signal was intentionally designed with two frequencies in order to combat the dispersion error caused by <b>transionospheric</b> <b>propagation.</b> For navigation the dispersion causes a nuisance delay in the range measurement. On the other hand the dual frequency ranging signal can probe the ionosphere if the transmitter and receiver are at known locations. Indeed GPS has become the most widely used sensor for ionospheric study. While the L-band (L 1 - 1575. 42 MHz and L 2 - 1227. 6 MHz) frequency selection for the GPS signal was largely political it {{has a great deal of}} technical merit in balancing propagation loss (f) against refraction (1 f).

40|$|The {{techniques}} are reviewed for measuring ionospheric electron content, {{the most important}} parameter {{in the study of}} <b>transionospheric</b> <b>propagation.</b> Data collected since 1964 have yielded a synoptic description of the behavior of the electron content in midlatitudes. Empirical relationships between the level of solar activity and the electron content were developed permitting the prognostication of the electron content values. Construction of such prognostication schemes was stimulated by current efforts to create accurate satellite borne navigation systems. Gravity waves propagating in the thermosphere leave a signature in the electron content records. Studies of such records have allowed the identification of the position of the gravity wave source, and its radiation pattern. A one-to-one relationship between these waves and polar substorms was revealed. Electron content measurements were used to monitor the protonosphere with good time resolution. Protonospheric storms were observed with this technique. Slab thickness data obtained from content measurements were used to determine the neutral air temperature in the thermosphere...|$|E
40|$|The {{current status}} and future {{prospects}} of the capability to make <b>transionospheric</b> <b>propagation</b> predictions are addressed, highlighting {{the effects of the}} ionized media, which dominate for frequencies below 1 to 3 GHz, depending upon the state of the ionosphere and the elevation angle through the Earth-space path. The primary concerns are the predictions of time delay of signal modulation (group path delay) and of radio wave scintillation. Progress in these areas is strongly tied to knowledge of variable structures in the ionosphere ranging from the large scale (thousands of kilometers in horizontal extent) to the fine scale (kilometer size). Ionospheric variability and the relative importance of various mechanisms responsible for the time histories observed in total electron content (TEC), proportional to signal group delay, and in irregularity formation are discussed in terms of capability to make both short and long term predictions. The data base upon which predictions are made is examined for its adequacy, and the prospects for prediction improvements by more theoretical studies as well as by increasing the available statistical data base are examined...|$|E
40|$|From the {{applications}} perspective the electron density {{is the major}} determining parameter of the ionosphere due to its strong impact on the radio signal propagation. As the most ionized ionospheric region, the F 2 layer has the most pronounced effect on <b>transionospheric</b> radio wave <b>propagation.</b> The maximum electron density of the F 2 layer, NmF 2, and its height, hmF 2, are of particular interest for radio communication applications {{as well as for}} characterizing the ionosphere. Since these ionospheric key parameters decisively shape the vertical electron density profiles, the precise calculation of them is of crucial importance for an accurate 3 -D electron density reconstruction. The vertical sounding by ionosondes provides the most reliable source of F 2 peak measurements. Within this paper, we compare the following data assimilation methods incorporating ionosonde measurements into a background model: Optimal Interpolation (OI), OI with time forecast (OI FC), the Successive Correction Method (SCM), and a modified SCM (MSCM) working with a daytime-dependent measurement error variance. These approaches are validated with the measurements of nine ionosonde stations for two periods covering quiet and disturbed ionospheric conditions. In particular, for the quiet period, we show that MSCM outperforms the other assimilation methods and allows an accuracy gain up to 75...|$|R
40|$|The ionospheric F 2 region {{around the}} peak density height hmF 2 of about 250 – 500 km causes the most {{pronounced}} impact on <b>transionospheric</b> radio wave <b>propagation.</b> Therefore, the peak electron {{density of the}} F 2 layer NmF 2 is a key parameter for characterizing the ionosphere. We present an empirical model approach that allows determining global NmF 2 with {{a limited number of}} model coefficients. The non-linear approach needs 13 coefficients and a few empirically fixed parameters for describing the NmF 2 dependencies on local time, geographic/geomagnetic location and solar irradiance and activity. The model approach is applied to a vast quantity of global NmF 2 data derived from GNSS radio occultation measurements by CHAMP, GRACE and COSMIC satellite missions and about 60 years of processed NmF 2 data from about 180 worldwide ionosonde stations. The model fits to these input data with the same standard and root mean squared (RMS) deviations of 2 × 1011 m- 3. The proposed Neustrelitz global NmF 2 model is climatological, i. e., the model describes the average behaviour under quiet geomagnetic conditions. A preliminary comparison with the electron density NeQuick model reveals similar results for NmF 2 with RMS deviations in the order of 2 × 1011 m- 3 and 5 × 1011 m- 3 for low and high solar activity conditions, respectively...|$|R
40|$|A Hybrid {{model for}} {{prediction}} of field scintillation on <b>transionospheric</b> paths of <b>propagation</b> was developed as {{the combination of}} the complex phase method (CPM) and random screen technique. In a recent paper [1] by Gherm et al., the model was described in detail. The initially developed propagation model [2] was solely based on the CPM, or the generalized Rytov’s approximation, which is not capable of describing the case of strong scintillation so that, to overcome this restriction, the CPM was combined with the random screen technique. In the contrast with widely employed effective phase screen (e. g. WBMOD, GISM), the random screen introduced in the present method is a physical screen with log-amplitude and phase fluctuations corresponding to a real field on a plane located below the ionosphere. To generate this random screen the relationships for spatial spectra of the phase and log-amplitude correlation functions, as well as their cross-correlation function, are utilized. They are derived in the framework of the CPM. According to the CPM the complex amplitude of the field which has propagated through the ionosphere is represented as follows: () () () tRrEtE o,,,,, ωωω rr =, (1) where E 0 is the undisturbed field, R is the random factor. The random factor R is treated in terms of the complex phase ψeR =, iS+ = χψ. (2) Correlation functions of fluctuations of χ and S and their cross-correlation are calculated in ray-centred variables with the variable s oriented along a curved line of sight (path of propagation) determined by a model of the 3 -D background ionosphere. Their spatial spectra are given by the following relationships: ++ = ∫ sDsDsDk sB ssJ dskB nnnnn S nS τττττετ ηηηηηη...|$|R
40|$|The {{electron}} {{content of}} the ionosphere is an important quantity which indicates overall ionization. It is measured by means of propagation effects on radio signals which penetrate the ionosphere. In Europe relevant investigations started after {{the launch of the}} first artificial satellites. Soon the necessity arose to organize international cooperation: the regional as well as the global geographical distribution of ionization parameters is important knowledge for any meaningful geophysical interpretation of ionization parameters. Despite the fact that international scientific Unions and Committees existed and had proven their usefulness and potential, private initiatives were taken to organize cooperation in the field of research based on <b>transionospheric</b> <b>propagation</b> effects. Only in 1971 three international groups joined together to form the "Beacon Satellite Group"as a "Working Party" of COSPAR.

40|$|The {{ionosphere}} has practical {{importance in}} GPS (Global Positioning System) applications because it influences <b>transionospheric</b> radio wave <b>propagation.</b> Among various phenomena in the ionosphere, ionospheric scintillation {{is characterized by}} rapid fluctuation and fading of the received signal intensity due to electron density irregularity inside the ionosphere. Deep signal fading caused by scintillation can lead to loss of lock of the carrier tracking loop in GPS receivers. The aircraft navigation system based on GPS and WAAS (Wide Area Augmentation System) uses code and carrier phase data to create the position estimate. If {{a significant number of}} carrier tracking channels lose lock simultaneously, the system cannot provide service until reacquiring a sufficient number of channels. Although scintillation is not frequent in the mid-latitude region, it is a potential hazard in terms of availability and continuity of the service in the equatorial region [1]. This paper investigates scintillation effects on GPS receivers during solar minimum in the equatorial region. Among four different receivers used for data collection in Brazil, this paper primarily focuses on the scintillation effects on a certified WAAS receiver because it is currently used for aircraft navigation. A maximum of two simultaneous loss of phase locks was observed in 0. 05 % of epochs. With the given satellite geometry, two satellites loss in a small fraction of time was not a critical problem for navigation. This paper also analyzes solar maximum data collected at Ascension Island during the previous solar maximum period. More satellite channels were affected by scintillation compared to solar minimum, but the maximum number of simultaneous loss of lock in a software receiver was the same as the solar minimum case. One of the most important results of this paper is that instances of simultaneous loss of satellite data can be reduced by minimizing reacquisition time of GPS receivers. Although 20 seconds reacquisition time is allowed by WAAS MOPS (Minimum Operational Performance Standards) [2], this number should be reduced to guarantee enough availability during strong scintillation...|$|R
