5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> {{cut down}} from the bridge at 11:00 on May 25 by order of the county commissioner, then taken to Okemah. The Nelsons' {{relatives}} did not claim the bodies, and they were buried by the county in the Greenleaf cemetery near Okemah.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> {{first put}} {{on display in}} the Eden Museum. Because it drew such large crowds city {{authorities}} insisted that <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>be</b> moved and closed <b>the</b> exhibit. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> then became part of a freak show in a Montreal circus. When the show went bankrupt <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> abandoned and left in a warehouse. In 1907, <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> found by a group of children. It was subsequently claimed by the University of Montreal for research purposes. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> later mummified and put on display in a glass case.|$|R

5|$|All {{identification}} of people {{was performed in}} Tromsø, as a cooperation between Troms Police District, National Criminal Investigation Service and the University Hospital of North Norway. By 18 September, all people had been identified, and <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> transported to Russia and Ukraine on 20 September after a short memorial in Tromsøhallen. An autopsy was performed on all crew members, without finding any abnormalities.|$|E
5|$|On 23 October 1817, a British sloop, William and Mary, foundered {{after hitting}} the rock islands near Flat Holm known as The Wolves (Bristol Channel). The ship {{was en route}} from Bristol to Waterford and sank within fifteen minutes. The Mate, John Outridge, and two sailors made off in the only lifeboat. Fifteen {{survivors}} were later rescued, having clung to the ship's rigging, but fifty-four other passengers were lost. Fifty of <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> recovered from the ship and were buried on Flat Holm.|$|E

5|$|The {{bodies of}} those killed in the {{massacre}} were exhumed in 1942 by the French, but only about 50 of the 97 were successfully identified. <b>The</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> then reburied in Le Paradis churchyard, which now forms part of the Le Paradis War Cemetery administered by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. In 1970, a memorial plaque {{was placed on the}} barn wall where the massacre took place and a large memorial was subsequently erected beside the church.|$|E
5|$|The coffins of General Sikorski and his Chief-of-Staff, General Kilimecki, were {{draped in}} the Polish National Flag and lay in {{state in the}} Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned. After a Requiem Mass, <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> carried in {{procession}} to the H.M. Dockyard with full Military Honours to be shipped to London in anticipation that General Sikorski's remains {{would one day be}} returned to a liberated Poland. The route to the dockyard was lined by British troops and the coffins carried and escorted by Polish Servicemen.|$|E
5|$|Up to 99% of the {{remaining}} prisoners were subsequently murdered. People from the Kozelsk camp were executed in Katyn Forest; people from the Starobelsk camp were murdered in the inner NKVD prison of Kharkiv and <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> buried {{near the village of}} Piatykhatky; and police officers from the Ostashkov camp were murdered in the internal NKVD prison of Kalinin (Tver) and buried in Mednoye.|$|E

5000|$|In Pinagbayanan, the {{cremation}} burials were secondary burials. In {{the first}} phase, <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> {{let alone to}} decompose. It is then followed by a ritual performance. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> burned because, according to the belief of ancient people, the “spirit is as clean as though washed in gold" [...] once <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> set on fire.|$|R
50|$|To prepare <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> {{protective}} clothing <b>is</b> recommended per usually {{with a second}} pair of thick rubber gloves. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> and <b>the</b> area around it is sprayed with 1:10 bleach solution. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> placed in a “body bag” (mortuary sack) and it <b>is</b> closed securely. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> bag <b>is</b> sprayed with 1:10 bleach solution. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> then transported to the burial site as soon as possible. Any person who must touch or carry <b>the</b> <b>body</b> during transport should wear the same {{protective clothing}} as is worn in the isolation area. The grave {{should be at least}} 2 meters deep. Viewing <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> not possible and the burial ceremony should be limited to family only. The interior of the vehicle where <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> carried should be rinsed with 1:10 bleach solution.|$|R
5|$|All {{bodies were}} in similar flexed {{positions}} lying on their left sides with knees raised up towards their chin. In comparison, most bodies excavated from Egypt {{dating to the}} predynastic period are in a similar position, however at Merimda Beni Salama and El-Amra bodies were found on their right sides. From the time these bodies were buried up until the Middle Kingdom period, the dead were laid on their sides. After this period they were buried on their backs (dorsal position), and from the Fifth Dynasty <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> always fully extended.|$|E
5|$|All {{the crew}} {{on board the}} ship {{at the time of}} the {{incident}} (41 in total) are believed to have died, although not all <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> found. In addition, one visitor to the ship (an officer's wife) and eight terminal workers were killed. Initial efforts to contain the fire were hampered by a lack of organization and poorly maintained fire-fighting equipment at the terminal. The Bantry fire brigade spent some time waiting at the town pier for a launch to take them onto the island. The terminal's own fire engine would not start. Firefighters had to break into the terminal's main depot to access materials and equipment (much of which did not work).|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} six crew members, {{a total of}} 160 {{passengers}} were on board {{at the time of}} the crash. Although there were 169 names on the original passenger list, nine did not board the flight. All <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> recovered from the wreckage. Karnataka Home Minister V. S. Acharya said eight people were initially reported to have survived, although one person died of his injuries—this was however refuted by an Air India spokesman who confirmed that all initial survivors were alive. This confusion arose after fire fighters rescued a little girl who died on the way to hospital. The airport manager at Mangalore, Peter Abraham confirmed that there were difficulties when trying to reach the plane.|$|E
50|$|In October 2014, a dead <b>body</b> <b>was</b> {{found at}} <b>the</b> mall, {{causing it to}} be closed for a day while <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> investigated. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> {{eventually}} determined to be a night shift custodian.|$|R
50|$|In 1946, Borremose man was {{discovered}} by peat diggers in the southernmost part of Borremose.

50|$|At many {{institutions}} {{the person responsible}} for handling, cleaning, and moving <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> called a diener, the German word for servant. In the UK this role is performed by an Anatomical Pathology Technologist who will also assist the pathologist in eviscerating <b>the</b> <b>body</b> and reconstruction after the autopsy. After <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> received, it is first photographed. The examiner then notes the kind of clothes and their position on <b>the</b> <b>body</b> before they <b>are</b> removed. Next, any evidence such as residue, flakes of paint or other material is collected from the external surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> Ultraviolet light may also be used to search body surfaces for any evidence not easily visible to the naked eye. Samples of hair, nails and the like <b>are</b> taken, and <b>the</b> <b>body</b> may also <b>be</b> radiographically imaged. Once the external evidence <b>is</b> collected, <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> removed from <b>the</b> bag, undressed, and any wounds present <b>are</b> examined. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> then cleaned, weighed, and measured in preparation for the internal examination. The scale used to weigh <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> often designed to accommodate the cart that <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> transported on; its weight is then deducted from the total weight shown to give the weight of <b>the</b> <b>body.</b>|$|R
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} police that Sheila was {{familiar}} with guns {{and that they had}} gone target shooting together. He said he had been at the farmhouse himself a few hours earlier, and that he had loaded the rifle because he thought he had heard rabbits outside. He had left it on the kitchen table fully loaded, with a box of ammunition nearby. After <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> discovered, a Dr. Craig, was called to the house to certify the deaths, which he testified could have occurred {{at any time during the}} night. He said Bamber appeared to be in a state of shock; Bamber broke down, cried and seemed to vomit. The doctor said Bamber told him about the discussion the family had had about possibly having Sheila's sons placed in foster care.|$|E
5|$|Beato's {{photographs}} of the Second Opium War {{are the first to}} document a military campaign as it unfolded, doing so through a sequence of dated and related images. His {{photographs of}} the Taku Forts represent this approach on a reduced scale, forming a narrative recreation of the battle. The sequence of images shows the approach to the forts, the effects of bombardments on the exterior walls and fortifications, and finally the devastation within the forts, including the bodies of dead Chinese soldiers. The photographs were not taken in this order, as the photographs of dead Chinese had to be taken first—before <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> removed; only then was Beato free to take the other views of the exterior and interior of the forts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the sinking, several ships sailed to the disaster area to recover victims' bodies. The White Star Line chartered the cable ship Mackay-Bennett from Halifax, Nova Scotia to retrieve bodies. Three other ships followed in the search: the cable ship Minia, the lighthouse supply ship Montmagny and the sealing vessel Algerine. Each ship left with embalming supplies, undertakers, and clergy. Upon recovery, each body retrieved by the Mackay-Bennett was numbered and given as detailed a description as possible to help aid in identification. The physical appearance of each body—height, weight, age, hair and eye colour, visible birthmarks, scars or tattoos, was catalogued and any personal effects on <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> gathered and placed in small canvas bags corresponding to their number.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the death}} {{occurs in a}} hospital, <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> taken to <b>the</b> funeral parlor or home before the funeral. In {{preparation}} for cremation (usually the day before or day of <b>the</b> cremation), <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> first washed while those present recite the Gurmantar Waheguru or Mool Mantar. Then <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> lovingly dressed with clean clothes complete with the Five Ks (in case of baptized Sikhs).|$|R

Silas then is arrested for the murders he committed, and the village holds a memorial for all of Silas's victims, including Rae Wilson, Rebecca Massey, India Longford.|$|R
5|$|Nineteen {{bodies were}} burned beyond recognition, {{but none of}} them {{appeared}} to be women or children, according to Pakistani officials. An article in The Nation, cited a grave digger at the cemetery where <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> being buried, who claimed there was the possibility {{that there may have been}} more than one body in each coffin. The article also stated that the government was digging more graves than previously established. The Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, a coalition of hard-line religious parties, claimed that between 400 and 1,000 students had been killed, along with women and children. Spanish-language news channels Univision, Antena 3, and Telecinco claimed that the total number of deaths in the siege was greater than 286 and could be as high as 300.|$|E
5|$|On 11 or 12 May 1941, {{a band of}} Ustaše led by Puk {{seized a}} group of Serb males from Glina and {{detained}} them regardless of occupation or class. The Ustaše then herded the group into an Orthodox Church and demanded that they be given documents proving the Serbs had all converted to Catholicism. Two Serbs produced the required documents and were released. The Ustaše then locked inside and massacred {{those who did not}} possess conversion certificates, including priest Bogdan Opačić. <b>The</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> then left to burn as the Ustaše set the church on fire and waited outside to shoot any survivors attempting to escape the flames. On 13 May, a further 100 Serb males were executed by the Ustaše in the nearby village of Prekopi.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of Gaddafi's death, NTC Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril publicly revealed the news. Gaddafi's corpse {{was placed in the}} freezer of a local market alongside the corpses of Yunis Jabr and Mutassim; <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> publicly displayed for four days, with Libyans {{from all over the country}} coming to view them. In response to international calls, on 24 October Jibril announced that a commission would investigate Gaddafi's death. On 25 October, the NTC announced that Gaddafi had been buried at an unidentified location in the desert. Seeking vengeance for the killing, Gaddafist sympathizers fatally wounded one of those who had captured Gaddafi, Omran Shaaban, near Bani Walid in September 2012.|$|E
