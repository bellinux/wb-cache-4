40|$|A flow {{visualization}} {{study of}} prosthetic aortic and mitral heart valves {{in a model}} of the aorta and left heart An in vitro flow visualization study has been carried out on a range of aortic and mitral valve prostheses mounted in rigid, transparent models of the aorta and left ventricle. The valves were subjected to pulsatile flow and the flow patterns produced by each valve were visualized by injecting multi-dye streams into the valve orifice, or by observing illuminated particles suspended in the flow. The patterns were recorded by still photography and high speed cinematography. In the mitral region each <b>tilting</b> <b>disc</b> <b>valve</b> produced a large vortex which dominated the ventricular cavity. By contrast disc and ball valves each produced an annular vortex, and the bioprosthesis produced a central flow. In the aortic region the flow patterns produced by a <b>tilting</b> <b>disc</b> <b>valve</b> depended on the orientation of the valve in the aorta.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: To {{evaluate}} midterm {{results of}} mechanical valves in pulmonary position {{in patients with}} pulmonary regurgitation and right ventricular dysfunction {{as an alternative to}} bioprostheses. Patients: Mechanical <b>valves</b> (six <b>tilting</b> <b>disc</b> <b>valves</b> and two bileaflet valves) were implanted in eight patients previously operated on for tetralogy of Fallot (n = 7) and truncus arteriosus (n = 1), with severe right ventricular dysfunction caused by massive pulmonary regurgitation. Results: All patients survived prosthesis implantation and are currently well. At follow-up (3 months to 9 years), they do not show signs of valve failure, and right ventricular function has dramatically improved in all but one, who still shows moderate ventricular hypokinesia. Conclusion: After operative correction of congenital heart defects in selected patients who show severe dysfunction of the right ventricle caused by pulmonary regurgitation/stenosis, mechanical valves may represent an alternative to bioprosthetic valves. The selection of the valve type is still a matter of debate. However, according to literature data, complications seem to have occurred only in patients with bileaflet mechanical valves in the pulmonary position, whereas no thromboembolic episodes or valve failure is reported in subjects with <b>tilting</b> <b>disc</b> <b>valves</b> in the right ventricular outflow. <b>Tilting</b> <b>disc</b> <b>valves</b> might perform better in the right ventricular outflow than bileaflet valves.

Three patients presented with subacute and chronic symptoms of prosthetic valve thrombosis of varying duration (7 days to 2 years). All 3 had a Medtronic Hall <b>tilting</b> <b>disc</b> <b>valve</b> implanted in a previous operation in the aortic or mitral position. Diagnosis was established by 2 -dimensional echocardiography. Under cardiopulmonary or femorofemoral bypass, thrombectomy and rotation of the disc within the valve housing were performed through a median sternotomy. All the patients had an uncomplicated postoperative course. Pressure gradients fell markedly at discharge 8 to 10 days after surgery. The patients were followed up for between 3 and 11 months, during which they showed excellent prosthetic valve function and reduced gradients. The ability to rotate the valve within the housing allows adequate thrombectomy and pannus excision.

With all types and positions of prostheses a distinct closing sound was always detected. It was frequently heard in two parts which, according to echocardiographic and phonocardiographic studies, resulted from the onset and completion of the valve closure. An opening sound could be heard from all Björk-Shiley and St Jude valves but from only four of the 11 Lillehei-Kaster valves. The opening sounds due to mitral prostheses consisted of two to three closely spaced clicks detected as a faint early diastolic crackle on auscultation.

Age at operation varied between I 2 days and I 2 years. Five patients had persistent truncus arteriosus, 3 had pulmonary atresia, and I had d-transposition of the great arteries with ventricular septal defect and subpulmonary stenosis. The only deaths have been in 2 desperately ill infants under 3 months of age. Survivors include a 2 -month-old infant with truncus arteriosus. Clinically the reconstructions continue to function satisfactorily afterfollow-up periods of up to i 8 months, without identifiable evidence of valve dysfunction or pulmonary embolism. The use of valved conduits to bridge discontinuities between the right ventricle (RV) and pulmonary arteries (Arai et al., I 965; Rastelli et al., I 965) has made possible surgical repair of various complex cardiac malformations, including pulmonary atresia, transposition of the great arteries with ventricular septal defect and subpulmonary stenosis, and truncus arteriosus. Allografts of the ascending aorta, incorporating the aortic valve and the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve, have most commonly been used as conduits, though imperfections of these grafts have led to the use of composite grafts of synthetic material incorporating a variety of valve mechanisms (Kouchoukos et al., I 971; Miki, Tatemichi, and Noguchi, I 97 I).

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: Platelet activation, {{which may}} lead to {{thrombus}} formation, is poorly understood after valve surgery when analysed by flow cytometry. It is still unclear whether platelet activation {{is due to the}} implanted prosthesis itself or to its aortic or mitral position. The present prospective study was aimed at assessing platelet P-selectin expression, platelet-leukocyte conjugate formation and platelet microparticles and comparing biological, bileaflet and <b>tilting</b> <b>disc</b> valvular prostheses in aortic position. METHODS: Thirty-three patients were included (15 bioprostheses, 11 bileaflet and 7 <b>tilting</b> <b>disc</b> mechanical <b>valves).</b> Blood samples were analyzed by flow cytometry immediately before surgery, on postoperative day 8 (D 8) and 2 months after surgery (M 2). RESULTS: At D 8, patients with bileaflet valves demonstrated a significant increase in platelet-leukocyte conjugates and in platelet microparticles whereas only platelet-monocyte conjugates were significantly increased in patients with bioprostheses. At M 2, platelet activation had returned to the basic level observed prior to surgery in the bileaflet valve group whereas, it was still increased in the bioprosthesis group. Neither at D 8 nor at M 2 did patients with <b>tilting</b> <b>disc</b> mechanical <b>valves</b> demonstrate any platelet activation.

Thirty-five patients (16. 8 %) had associated coronary bypass surgery (AVR 23. 7 %, MVR 7. 8 %). There were seven deaths (3. 4 %) occurring during the same hospitalization (AVR: 3 / 118, 2. 5 %; MVR: 4 / 90, 4. 4 %).

40|$|Congenital {{heart valve}} disease {{is one of}} the most common {{abnormalities}} in children, with common valve defects being aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, and valvular regurgitation. Although adult sized mechanical heart valve (MHV) replacements are widely studied and utilized, there are currently no FDA approved prosthetic heart valves available for the pediatric population. This is due to a variety of reasons such as a limited patient pool for clinical trials, limited valve sizes, and complex health histories in children. Much like adult sized mechanical heart valves, potential complications with pediatric heart valve replacements include thrombosis, blood damage due to high shear stresses, and cavitation. Due to pediatric sized MHVs being much smaller in size than adult MHVs, different fluid dynamic conditions and associated complications are expected. In order to accelerate the approval of pediatric sized heart valves for clinical use, it is important to first characterize and assess the fluid dynamics across pediatric sized heart valves. By understanding the hemodynamic performance of the valve, connections can be made concerning potential valve complications such as thrombosis and cavitation. The overall objective of this study is to better characterize and assess the flow field characteristics of a pediatric sized mechanical heart valve using flow visualization techniques in a mock circulatory loop. The mechanical heart valve chosen for this research was a size 17 mm Bjork-Shiley <b>tilting</b> <b>disc</b> <b>valve,</b> as this is a common size valve used for younger patients with smaller cardiovascular anatomy. The mock circulatory loop used in this research was designed to provide realistic pediatric physiological flow conditions, consisting of a Harvard Apparatus Pulsatile blood pump, venous reservoir, and a heart valve testing chamber. In order to expose the valve to realistic pediatric flow conditions, six unique pump operating conditions were tested that involved pre-determined heart rate and stroke volume combinations. In addition, a modified aortic root model was used to hold the mechanical heart valve in place within the loop and to provide more realistic aortic root geometry. This heart valve chamber was made from a transparent acrylic material, allowing for fluid flow visualization. A traditional Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) experimental set up was used in order to illuminate the particles seeded within the fluid path, and thus allowing for the capture of sequential images using a high speed camera. The data collected throughout this study consisted of flow rate measurements using an ultrasonic flow meter, and the sequential PIV images obtained from the camera in order to analyze general flow characteristics across the pediatric valve. Such information regarding the flow profile across the valve allowed for conclusions to be made regarding the valve performance, such as average flow velocities and regions of regurgitant flow. By gaining a better understanding of the fluid dynamic profile across a pediatric sized heart valve, this may aid in the eventual approval of pediatric sized mechanical heart valves for future clinical use...|$|E

Eighty-six valves were studied late (20 to 52 weeks), whereas the remainder were studied early (0 to 10 days) after operation. The valves included 3 types of ball and cage valves, 3 types of <b>disc</b> and cage <b>valves,</b> 7 types of <b>tilting</b> <b>disc</b> <b>valves,</b> 1 type of bileaflet hemidisc mechanical valve, 13 types of porcine aortic valves and 5 types of bovine pericardial valves. The results of these studies were compared with those obtained in 40 studies of 20 native mitral valves. Doppler color velocity/flow profiles were imaged in real time with simultaneous electrocardiographic gating; the aortic flow was also displayed for the timing of velocity/flow events. Native normal mitral valves had no in-orifice flow disturbances and laminar low velocity/flow directed toward the left ventricular apex. Ball and cage and <b>disc</b> and cage <b>valves</b> had high velocity peripheral jets and vortices of velocity/flow reversals distal to the occluders. <b>Tilting</b> <b>disc</b> <b>valves</b> had differing velocity/flow patterns determined by their orientation in the mitral anulus.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: We {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the Doppler assessment of effective orifice area in aortic prosthetic valves. The effective orifice area is a less flow-dependent parameter than Doppler gradients {{that is used to}} assess prosthetic valve function. However, in vivo reference values show a pronounced spread of effective orifice area and smaller orifices than expected compared with the geometric area. Methods: Using Doppler echocardiography, we studied patients who received a bileaflet St Jude Medical valve (n = 75; St Jude Medical, Inc, St Paul, Minn) or a <b>tilting</b> <b>disc</b> Omnicarbon <b>valve</b> (n = 46; MedicalCV, Incorporated, Inver Grove Heights, Minn). The prosthetic valves were also investigated in vitro in a steady-flow model with Doppler and catheter measurements in the different orifices. The effective orifice area was calculated according to the continuity equation. Results: In vivo, there was a wide distribution with the coefficient of variation (SD/mean × 100 %) for different valve sizes ranging from 21 % to 39 % in the St Jude Medical valve and from 25 % to 33 % in the Omnicarbon valve. The differences between geometric orifice area and effective orifice area in vitro were 1. 26 ± 0. 41 cm 2 for St Jude Medical and 1. 17 ± 0. 38 cm 2 for Omnicarbon valves. The overall effective orifice areas and peak catheter gradients were similar: 1. 35 ± 0. 37 cm 2 and 25. 9 ± 16. 1 mm Hg for St Jude Medical and 1. 46 ± 0. 49 cm 2 and 24. 6 ± 17. 7 mm Hg for Omnicarbon. However, in St Jude Medical valves, more pressure was recovered downstream, 11. 6 ± 6. 3 mm Hg versus 3. 4 ± 1. 6 mm Hg in Omnicarbon valves (P =. 0001). Conclusions: In the patients, we found a pronounced spread of effective orifice areas, which can be explained by measurement errors or true biologic variations. The in vitro effective orifice area was small compared with the geometric orifice area, and we suspect that nonuniformity in the spatial velocity profile causes underestimation. The St Jude Medical and Omnicarbon valves showed similar peak catheter gradients and effective orifice areas in vitro, but more pressure was recovered in the St Jude Medical valve. The effective orifice area can therefore be misleading in the assessment of prosthetic valve performance when bileaflet and <b>tilting</b> <b>disc</b> <b>valves</b> are compared.

40|$|Objectives Patients with {{prosthetic}} {{heart valves}} may require assessment for coronary artery disease. We assessed whether valve artefacts hamper coronary artery assessment by multidetector CT. Methods ECG-gated or -triggered CT angiograms {{were selected from}} our PACS archive based {{on the presence of}} prosthetic heart valves. The best systolic and diastolic axial reconstructions were selected for coronary assessment. Each present coronary segment was scored for the presence of valve-related artefacts prohibiting coronary artery assessment. Scoring was performed in consensus by two observers. Results Eighty-two CT angiograms were performed on a 64 -slice (= 27) or 256 -slice (= 55) multidetector CT. Eighty-nine valves and five annuloplasty rings were present. Forty-three out of 1160 (3. 7 %) present coronary artery segments were non-diagnostic due to valve artefacts (14 / 82 patients). Valve artefacts were located in right coronary artery (15 / 43; 35 %), left anterior descending artery (2 / 43; 5 %), circumflex artery (14 / 43; 32 %) and marginal obtuse (12 / 43; 28 %) segments. All cobalt-chrome containing valves caused artefacts prohibiting coronary assessment. Biological and titanium-containing valves did not cause artefacts except for three specific valve types.

40|$|AbstractDiscussion of {{aortic valve}} {{replacement}} has primarily concerned {{the choice between}} tissue and mechanical prostheses. Less emphasis {{has been placed on}} prosthesis size. Despite technical advances increasing prosthesis orifice area, small valves implanted in the unenlarged aortic root may not be significantly less obstructive than the stenotic native valves they replace. Methods: In this work we studied 52 patients (31 women, 21 men; mean age 59. 2 years) in whom valve prostheses sized 19, 21, 23, or 25 mm (30 bioprostheses and 22 <b>tilting</b> <b>disc</b> <b>valves)</b> had been implanted to replace stenotic aortic valves. Most patients with 19 or 21 mm prostheses were women. Doppler and conventional echocardiographic studies were performed in the 10 days preceding the operation and between 10 and 40 months (mean 18 months) after the operation. The patients receiving larger valve sizes had significantly larger body surface areas than those receiving smaller valve sizes (mainly women). Results: No significant differences were observed between preoperative and postoperative diameters or left ventricular systolic function parameters, but left ventricular mass and mass index decreased in all four groups (albeit nonsignificantly in the 19 mm group, and with less statistical significance in the 21 mm group than in the 23 and 25 mm groups). Postoperative peak and mean transvalvular pressure drops were significantly greater in the 19 mm group than in the other groups, and the 21 mm group had significantly greater transvalvular pressure drops than the 25 mm group. Postoperative effective valve area was significantly smaller in the 19 mm group than in the 21 mm group, and significantly smaller in the 21 mm group than in the 23 and 25 mm groups. Conclusion: We conclude that despite undeniable recent improvements in the design of artificial heart valves, 19 mm aortic prostheses continue to create significant obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract and, possibly as a consequence of this, fail to bring about significant reduction in left ventricular hypertrophy.

40|$|The Bjork-Shiley Monostrut <b>valve</b> is <b>tilting</b> <b>disc</b> {{mechanical}} <b>valve</b> prosthesis. This {{study was}} designed to present the long-term outcome of our experience. One hun-dred and thirty-seven Bjork-Shiley Monostrut valves were implanted in 101 consecutive patients from November 1983 to February 1990. There were 60 male and 41 female with mean age of 34. 5 yr at the time of operation. Fifty-nine patients underwent single valve replacement, 38 had double valve, and 4 had triple valve replacement. There were six in-hospital deaths (5. 9 %) : three from cardiopulmonary bypass weaning failure and one each from septic shock, sudden cardiac arrest, and uncontrollable bleeding. Mean duration of follow-up was 181. 2 ± 76. 2 months. Overall survival was 86. 2 % at 15 yr and 83. 1 % at 20 yr. Patients with mitral valve replacement had 93. 5 % and 90. 2 % cumulative survival at 10 and 15 yr, respectively, while patients with aortic valve replacement had 91. 1 % and 86. 5 % cumulative survival at 10 and 15 yr. Two groups had no significant difference in survival. Double valve replacement patients had 92. 2 % and 84. 0 % survival at 10 and 15 yr, respectively.

50|$|A {{swing check}} <b>valve</b> or <b>tilting</b> <b>disc</b> check <b>valve</b> is {{a check valve}} in which the disc, the movable part to block the flow, swings on a hinge or trunnion, either onto the seat to block reverse flow or off the seat to allow forward flow. The seat opening {{cross-section}} may be perpendicular to the centerline between the two ports or at an angle. Although swing check valves can come in various sizes, large check valves are often swing check valves. The flapper valve in a flush-toilet mechanism {{is an example of}} this type of valve. Tank pressure holding it closed is overcome by manual lift of the flapper. It then remains open until the tank drains and the flapper falls due to gravity. Another variation of this mechanism is the clapper valve, used in applications such firefighting and fire life safety systems. A hinged gate only remains open in the inflowing direction. The clapper valve often also has a spring that keeps the gate shut when there is no forward pressure. Another example is the backwater valve (for sanitary drainage system) that protects against flooding caused by return flow of sewage waters. Such risk occurs most often in sanitary drainage systems connected to combined sewerage systems and in rainwater drainage systems. It may be caused by intense rainfall, thaw or flood.|$|R
40|$|Aims TTK Chitra {{heart valve}} {{prosthesis}} (CHVP), a <b>tilting</b> <b>disc</b> mechanical heart <b>valve</b> of low cost and proven efficacy, {{has been in}} use for the last 15 years. Although various studies substantiating its long-term safety and efficacy are available, no study had assessed its echocardiographic characteristics. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the normal Doppler parameters of CHVP in the mitral pos-ition and to assess whether derivation of mitral valve area (MVA) using the continuity equation (CE) and more commonly used pressure half-time (PHT) method is comparable in the functional assessment of this <b>tilting</b> <b>disc</b> mitral prosthesis. Methods and results Doppler echocardiography was performed in 40 consecutive patients with CHVP in the mitral position. All patients were clinically stable, without evidence of prosthetic valve dysfunction such as significant obstruction or regurgitation, endocarditis, left ventricular dysfunction (ejection frac-tion, 40 %), or significant aortic regurgitation. Valve sizes studied included 25, 27, and 29 mm. Mitral valve area was derived both by the PHT method and by the CE, using the stroke volume measured in the ventricular outflow tract divided by the time–velocity integral of CHVP jet. The peak Doppler gra-dient ranged from 5 to 21 (mean 11. 0) mmHg, and the mean gradient ranged from 1. 7 to 9. 2 (mean 4. 1) mmHg. Mean gradient negatively correlated with an increase in the actual orifice area (AOA...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. The Björk-Shiley Delrin (BSD) <b>tilting</b> <b>disc</b> heart <b>valve</b> {{was first}} {{clinically}} used in 1969. A triple BSD valve replacement {{has not been}} quite common, because of high postoperative risk and complications, {{but there have been}} several cases with different postoperative course. The first implantation of artificial valve in Yugoslavia was done by Prof. Isidor Papo, in 1965. Case report. We presented patient with more than 30 years of successful triple (aortic, mitral and tricuspid) BSD valve functioning. This is a rare case of a triple BSD valve long-term functioning and, as far as we know, the case of the longest period of successful functioning of the triple BSD valves. In March 1977, a 34 -year-old female with severe congestive heart failure of the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class IV was admitted to the Military Medical Academy, Belgrade, for triple valve (aortic, mitral and tricuspid) surgery with BSD mechanical valves. Complicated surgery was done well. Sixteen months later the patient was diagnosed with infective endocarditis caused by Enterobacter spp. that was isolated from blood cultures. The patient was successfully cured. After that the patient had no cardiovascular symptoms and regular physical and echocardiographic examinations used to reveal satisfactory cardiovascular function. The patient died more than 30 years after the surgery due to a terminal phase of uterine carcinoma. Conclusion. Although BSD valves were withdrawn from clinical use long time ago, there are still some rare cases of their successful functioning, mostly due to the precise surgical technique and regular follow-up by the cardiologists...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and peripapillary choroidal thickness in eyes with <b>tilted</b> optic <b>disc</b> {{in order to identify}} characteristic RNFL and peripapillary choroid patterns verified by optical coherence tomography (OCT). Methods: Twenty-nine eyes of 29 patients with <b>tilted</b> optic <b>discs</b> were studied with spectral-domain (SD) -OCT and compared with age and sex-matched control subjects in a prospective design. The imaging of RNFL was performed using circular scans of a diameter of 3. 4 mm around the optic disc using OCT. For measurements of peripapillary choroidal thickness, the standar d protocol for RNFL assessment was performed. Results: SD-OCT indicated significantly lower superotemporal (p< 0. 001), superonasal (p= 0. 001), and global (p= 0. 005) RNFL thicknesses in the <b>tilted</b> <b>disc</b> group than those of the control group. Peripapillary choroid was significantly thicker {{at the site of the}} elevated rim of eyes with <b>tilted</b> <b>disc</b> (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: This study demonstrated a clinical characterization of the main <b>tilted</b> <b>disc</b> morphologies that may be helpful in differentiating a <b>tilted</b> <b>disc</b> from other altered disc morphologies.
