60|$|As I {{spoke the}} word, a {{carriage}} had rumbled along the street, and stopt before <b>the</b> house. <b>The</b> <b>doorbell</b> <b>rang,</b> and steps were immediately afterwards {{heard on the}} staircase. Zenobia had thrown a shawl over her dress.|$|R
60|$|At {{four o'clock}} <b>the</b> <b>doorbell</b> <b>rang,</b> and shortly {{thereafter}} Ellen appeared, simpering and apologetic enough, with a card. She {{had taken the}} trouble to read it this time. Cynthia was angry, or thought she was, and her cheeks were very red.|$|R

60|$|This exclamation, {{astonishing}} and out {{of place}} as it was, {{was caused by a}} <b>ring</b> at <b>the</b> <b>doorbell.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ring</b> was followed by a whispering and giggling in the hall, and then by the entrance of the Misses Merrill into the parlor. Curiosity had been too strong for them. Susan was human, and here was the opportunity for a little revenge. In justice to her, she meant the revenge to be very slight.|$|R

40|$|So when <b>the</b> <b>doorbell</b> <b>rang</b> <b>the</b> night before, it was Liza in a hat {{pulled down}} so nobody would {{recognize}} her, {{and she said}} to Halston, “Give me every drug you’ve got. ” So {{he gave her a}} bottle of coke, a few sticks of marijuana, a Valium, four Quaaludes, and they were all wrapped in a tiny box, and then a little figure in a white hat came up on the stoop and kissed Halston, and it was Marty Scorcese, he’d been hiding around the corner, and then he and Liza went off to have their affair on all the drugs (Diaries, Tuesday, January 3, 1978) ...|$|R

30|$|This {{evokes a}} world in which ‘she’ was barefoot outside in the back yard drowsing in the sun; there is an implicature that <b>the</b> <b>doorbell</b> <b>rang</b> and she went through the cramped kitchen, with its tiles she {{probably}} doesn’t like, to find out who is <b>ringing</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorbell.</b> <b>The</b> time is the present as determined by additional co-text, which will also most probably offer more information about the identity of ‘she’ and the location. Although ‘she’ could be a girl-child, the second sentence quoted makes her more likely to be adult. The reference to a previous tenant makes it most likely that the property is rented not owned. These are all things cued by the semantics of the language used but fleshed out by the pragmatic modulation of the context evoked.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>doorbell</b> <b>rings.</b> It's Albert Leach, {{an agent}} of the Treasury Department, wanting to know if Archie has seen or spoken with a young woman named Tammy Baxter or an older woman named Hattie Annis. Archie, not caring for Leach's approach, shoos him. Then he returns to the front room, closely {{examines}} one of the twenties, and announces that there will probably be a reward: the bills are counterfeit.|$|E

50|$|When Archie {{finishes}} reporting, <b>the</b> <b>doorbell</b> <b>rings.</b> It's Cherry Quon, without appointment, {{wanting to}} speak with Wolfe. It comes out that Miss Quon recently became engaged to marry Bottweill. She is convinced that Margot murdered Bottweill in a rage at being thrown over for Miss Quon. And she delivers a bombshell: she knows it was Wolfe who played Santa at the party. Bottweill {{had told her that}} morning at breakfast.|$|E
