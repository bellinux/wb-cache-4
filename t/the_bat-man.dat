50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bat-Man</b> is changing, {{becoming}} more bat-like in appearance as time passes. He kidnaps Julia {{from her home}} and runs off with her. Bruce learns of this and starts the chase. Hot on the Bat-Man's trail, Bruce stumbles upon Dr. Seltsam's lab. The Doctor has captured the Bat-Hound, and has both Alfredo and the robber strapped to machinery in his lab. Seltsam tells the robber that {{he is no longer}} useful and {{that he is going to}} kill him. As the machinery does its work, Bruce intervenes but it is too late for the robber. Seltsam reveals that the miracle preserving liquid is mainly composed of brain liquid and that the highway robbers were all his henchmen. Seltsam explains that Bruce's father was against his methods of progress through murder and that is why he had to be killed. Seltsam activates the self-destruct sequence in his lab. <b>The</b> <b>Bat-Man</b> barges in the lab, lets Julia go and attacks Seltsam. As the lab crumbles, Seltsam accidentally electrocutes himself and dies. <b>The</b> <b>Bat-Man</b> holds up the roof of the crumbling building, letting the others escape. It calls Bruce 'son' before the lab explodes and kills it. Alfredo theorizes that <b>the</b> <b>Bat-Man</b> kidnapped Julia so Bruce would follow him to Seltsam's lab. As a mob arrives to the burning ruins, Bruce explains to them how Seltsam was destroyed because of <b>the</b> <b>Bat-Man.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Batman: Castle of the Bat, which {{features}} Bruce Wayne as a Frankenstein-esque doctor while <b>the</b> <b>Bat-Man</b> is his reanimated father, the Bat-Man's initial attire {{is intended to}} aid in his father's altered awareness of his new senses and mask some of the necessary scarring, the familiar cowl accompanied by a short cloak around the shoulders and upper arms. As <b>the</b> <b>Bat-Man</b> 'evolves' he discards the cowl and his head becomes distinctly bat-like.|$|E
50|$|Bruce clothes the {{creature}} in a costume, which mask the scars and will supposedly help recovering the memories. He injects {{it with a}} serum that will give it some attributes of a bat. It becomes aware of itself, sees its hideous face and breaks out of the laboratory, escaping in the night. Weeks pass, as <b>the</b> <b>Bat-Man</b> roams the roads and attacks burglars or criminals, and Bruce's attempts to find it are fruitless. One night though, using the Bat-Hound to track <b>the</b> <b>Bat-Man,</b> they find him attacking the robber who killed Bruce's parents. Bruce stops it from killing the criminal. Before running away, the robber reveals that {{he was hired by}} someone. Bruce sends Alfredo to investigate, while he returns <b>the</b> <b>Bat-Man</b> to the castle. Before falling asleep, Bruce mumbles about Julia, about where she is staying.|$|E
50|$|While {{foraging}} {{for more}} tubers, Bruce hears a ringing in his ears, feels his face grow hot, and then loses consciousness. He is {{awakened by a}} strange man who introduces himself as Bram Simmons, a scientist who came to Venus alone five years earlier. Nearby stand several man-sized bat-like creatures whose ultrasonic emissions had knocked Bruce out. Simmons shoos <b>the</b> <b>bat-men</b> away and tells Bruce what kind of trouble {{he and his family}} are in. <b>The</b> <b>bat-men</b> are vampires, usually drawing blood from the dinosaur-like beasts kept in corrals around the area, {{and that there is a}} large colony of bat-men nearby.|$|R
50|$|Having {{assumed that}} no one survived {{the crash of the}} Aurora, the spacemen have come to {{retrieve}} the gadget that Auroras captain had warned Bruce not to mention. It is a top-secret military machine — and Frank has been playing with it! With the machine in hand, the spacemen take the Robinsons back to Earth with them: Simmons chooses to stay on Venus, living with <b>the</b> <b>bat-men.</b>|$|R
50|$|After Bruce {{returns to}} the cave, as night is falling, the Robinsons come under attack. At first Paul and Bruce repel the attackers with their carbines, but then they run out of ammunition. As all seems lost, star shells and grenades explode in the valley below the cave, and <b>the</b> <b>bat-men,</b> thrown into {{confusion}} and distress, flee the scene: the space marines have landed.|$|R
5000|$|Thomas Wayne: Bruce's father, {{a highly}} reputed doctor who {{believed}} there was no nobler profession. He is murdered by a highway robber and later reanimated by Bruce and becomes <b>the</b> <b>Bat-Man.</b> His appearance is an obvious homage to the monster in the 1931 movie.|$|E
5000|$|In Batman: Castle of the Bat, {{scientist}} Bruce Wayne creates {{and brings}} to life a patchwork corpse containing bat DNA {{and the brain}} of his father, Thomas Wayne. This Bat-Man escapes from Wayne's castle and starts attacking highwaymen due to the vague memories of Thomas Wayne's death. Wayne also patrols the highways, stopping thieves. Through {{the course of the}} story, <b>the</b> <b>Bat-Man</b> starts becoming more bat than man as the bat DNA starts to overcome the body.|$|E
5000|$|In his 1989 autobiography, Kane {{detailed}} Finger's {{contributions to}} Batman's creation: One day I called Bill and said, 'I {{have a new}} character called <b>the</b> <b>Bat-Man</b> and I've made some crude, elementary sketches I'd like you to look at.' He came over and I showed him the drawings. At the time, I only had a small domino mask, like the one Robin later wore, on Batman's face. Bill said, 'Why not make him {{look more like a}} bat and put a hood on him, and take the eyeballs out and just put slits for eyes to make him look more mysterious?' At this point, <b>the</b> <b>Bat-Man</b> wore a red union suit; the wings, trunks, and mask were black. I thought that red and black would be a good combination. Bill said that the costume was too bright: 'Color it dark grey to make it look more ominous.' The cape looked like two stiff bat wings attached to his arms. As Bill and I talked, we realized that these wings would get cumbersome when Bat-Man was in action and changed them into a cape, scalloped to look like bat wings when he was fighting or swinging down on a rope. Also, he didn't have any gloves on, and we added them so that he wouldn't leave fingerprints.|$|E
50|$|The heroes {{hide from}} <b>the</b> chasing <b>Bat-men</b> {{in an empty}} {{sarcophagus}} only {{for it to be}} stabbed repeatedly with their spears.|$|R
50|$|Bob Kane’s {{original}} {{sketch of}} the character {{was very different from}} the Batman we know today. Kane showed the very first drawing of a character he had first named <b>the</b> Bat, then <b>Bat-Man,</b> to Bill Finger who was the writer he hired to write the first Batman stories. Bill thought that the character looked too much like Superman, so he suggested major changes that would prove to be everlasting to the character’s legacy.|$|R
50|$|Superman: At Earth's End is a 1995 {{comic book}} Elseworlds story, {{published}} by DC Comics. Written by Tom Veitch with art by Frank Gomez. The story {{set in a}} post-apocalyptic future, where mutations run wild, and a white-maned Man of Steel has begun a fight against new scourge sweep across the Earth—a nightmare army of <b>bat-men.</b> <b>The</b> book is, more or less, the sequel to the miniseries Kamandi: At Earth's End, which itself was a reimagining of the DC Comic series Kamandi, created by Jack Kirby in 1972.|$|R
