5|$|In , a 2010 {{documentary}} film narrated by Dustin Hoffman, Youkilis noted: It's something that I probably won’t realize until my career is over, {{how many people}} are really rooting for me and cheering for me. And it's not just because I went 3-for-4, or had a great game. It's just the fact that I represent a lot of Jewish people {{and a lot of the}} Jewish heritage, and the struggles <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> our people have had.|$|E
5|$|It {{just seems}} like a feel-good record but when you really listen to the lyrics, it's about me growing up. In my household, I didn't go all of the parties and I didn't {{do all the things}} <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the other teenage girls did because I was so in love with my radio and my music.

5|$|Stefan Kieniewicz, {{in a more}} {{critical}} treatment in the Polish Biographical Dictionary, notes <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> her exploits are poorly documented, {{and it is not}} always possible to separate legend from facts. He notes it is not certain she ever commanded any unit, and that her role as the commander of the 25th Regiment was more honorary than real; he also notes that she is known to have fainted on the battlefield, distracting her comrades, and in at least one instance (at the battle of Šiauliai), she was purposefully held behind front lines, as her comrades tried to ensure she would not endanger herself.|$|E
5|$|You are right. I did {{not think}} anything. I wasn’t thinking. I was feeling and I was dying. And then I was just like, You can’t go down like this! You have to turn this into music. You have to try, at least. I was so embarrassed by just everything. I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after all of <b>that.</b> <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks and doing it all. I was like, Why am I here? Then I got the perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. It was an amazing awakening. I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E

25|$|The m6A {{modification}} affects tRNA incorporation’s distinct {{steps in}} different ways. It slows down GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu 12-fold, delays tRNA accommodation two-fold, and it slows down peptidyl transfer two-fold. It also causes a 1.5-fold {{increase in the}} amount of GTP hydrolyzed per peptidyl transfer, which indicates <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> proofreading is required. Overall, this m6A modification leads to a kinetic loss of a factor of 18.|$|E

But I must take the credit away, since I know better. The first man that ever did a scat number in history of this country was a man from Vicksburg, Mississippi, by the name of Joe Sims, an old comedian. And from that, Tony Jackson and myself, and several more grabbed it in New Orleans. And found it was pretty good for an introduction of a song.|$|E

Military operations continued, with great success for the allies.|$|E
25|$|By the 1990s, {{some of the}} {{previous}} research topics became more active than the others. Research in projective 3-D reconstructions led to better understanding of camera calibration. With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the ideas were already explored in bundle adjustment theory {{from the field of}} photogrammetry. This led to methods for sparse 3-D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images. Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multi-view stereo techniques. At the same time, variations of graph cut were used to solve image segmentation. This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images (see Eigenface). Toward the end of the 1990s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of computer graphics and computer vision. This included image-based rendering, image morphing, view interpolation, panoramic image stitching and early light-field rendering.|$|E
