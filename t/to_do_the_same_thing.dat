25|$|The group put {{themselves}} through challenges that {{forced them to}} find the physical and mental strength to succeed. Examples included training without food or water, or sleeping on the floor without a blanket, to learn to endure the cold.

If any member completed a challenge, everyone else had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing.</b> During their training no one was allowed to complain or be negative. Few excuses were allowed. For instance, if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out {{in order to make a}} jump, he had to do it anyway, even if it meant doing the jump barefoot. At the same time, everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits.|$|E

NBC, pleased by the success that the expansion of Another World had brought to the network, elected <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> with Days of Our Lives beginning on April 21, 1975; this put Days of Our Lives and As the World Turns in direct competition for ratings.

500|$|Grand Theft Auto Vs {{multiple}} protagonist {{design was}} envisioned {{to improve the}} series core mechanics.
