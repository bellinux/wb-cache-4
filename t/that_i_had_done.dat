He had no prior {{intention}} to leave Hungary until he learned from his mother that the Hungarian Secret Police were looking for him. Racz said if they found him, [...] "That would have meant the end of my dreams to become a doctor. Perhaps I would have ended up in prison. Not <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> anything but many other people ended up in prison following 1956 without committing any crime." [...] He arrived in the Austrian town of Eisenstadt where buses were waiting to take refugees to their new homes. Racz chose the bus to England, and he along with his family and other members of his group were transported to a military base in the Midlands.|$|E
500|$|Returning to the U.S., {{the newlyweds}} settled in a New York City {{house that was}} {{provided}} by Franklin's mother, {{as well as in}} a second residence at the family's estate overlooking the Hudson River in Hyde Park, New York. From the beginning, Eleanor had a contentious relationship with her controlling mother-in-law. The townhouse that Sara gave to Eleanor and Franklin was connected to her own residence by sliding doors, and Sara ran both households in the decade after the marriage. Early on, Eleanor had a breakdown in which she explained to Franklin that [...] "I did not like to live in a house which was not in any way mine, one <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> nothing about and which did not represent the way I wanted to live", but little changed. Sara also sought to control the raising of her grandchildren, and Eleanor reflected later that [...] "Franklin's children were more my mother-in-law's children than they were mine". Eleanor's eldest son James remembered Sara telling her grandchildren, [...] "Your mother only bore you, I am more your mother than your mother is." ...|$|E

2500|$|In October 1881 Rus {{magazine}} {{started publishing}} [...] "The Tale of Cross-eyed Lefty from Tula and the Steel Flea", which {{is seen in}} retrospect as Leskov's finest piece of work, bringing {{out the best in}} him as an ingenious storyteller and stylistic virtuoso whose skaz style is rich in word play and full of original neologisms, each carrying not only humorous but satirical messages. In Lefty the author's point of view is engaged in lively interplay with that of the main (grotesquely naive, simple-minded) character. [...] "Some people argued <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> little to distinguish between the good and the bad, and that it was difficult to make out who was a helper and who put wrenches in the works. This {{can be explained by the}} intrinsic deceitfulness of my own character," [...] Leskov later wrote. Most deceitful (according to critic B. Bukhstab) was the author's treatment of the character ataman Platov, whose actions, even as they are described in a grotesquely heroic manner by the simple-minded protagonist, are openly ridiculed by the author. What would later come to be seen as one of the gems of Russian literature was fiercely attacked both from the left (who accused Leskov of propagating jingoistic ideas) and the right, who found the general picture of the common people's existence as depicted in the story a bit too gloomy for their taste.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the late}} 17th century, {{it had become}} an ever more widely held view that {{equitable}} rules and the law of trusts varied unpredictably, as the jurist John Selden remarked, according {{to the size of}} the [...] "Chancellor's foot". Over the 18th century English property law, and trusts with it, mostly came to a standstill in legislation, but the Court of Chancery continued to develop equitable principles notably under Lord Nottingham (from 1673–1682), Lord King (1725–1733), Lord Hardwicke (1737–1756), and Lord Henley (1757–1766). In 1765, the first Professor of English law, William Blackstone wrote in his Commentaries on the Laws of England that equity should not be seen as a distinct body of rules, separate from the other laws of England. For example, although it was [...] "said that a court of equity determines according to the spirit of the rule and not according to the strictness of the letter," [...] wrote Blackstone, [...] "so also does a court of law" [...] and the result was that each system of courts was attempting to reach [...] "the same principles of justice and positive law". Blackstone's influence reached far. Chancellors became more concerned to standardise and harmonise equitable principles. At the start of the 19th century in Gee v Pritchard, referring to John Selden's quip, Lord Eldon (1801–1827) said 'Nothing would inflict upon me greater pain in quitting this place than the recollection <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> anything to justify the reproach that the equity of this court varies like the Chancellor's foot.' The Court of Chancery was meant to have mitigated the petty strictnesses of the common law of property. But instead, came to be seen as cumbersome and arcane. This was partly because until 1813, there was only the Lord Chancellor and the Master of the Rolls working as judges. Work was slow. In 1813, a Vice-Chancellor was appointed, in 1841 two more, and in 1851 two Lord Justices of Appeal in Chancery (making seven). But this did not save it from ridicule. In particular, Charles Dickens (1812–1870), who himself worked as a clerk near Chancery Lane, wrote Bleak House in 1853, depicting a fictional case of Jarndyce v Jarndyce, a Chancery matter about wills that nobody understood and dragged on for years and years. Within twenty years, separate courts of equity were abolished. Parliament merged the common law and equity courts into one system with the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873. Equitable principles would prevail over common law rules in case of conflict, but the separate identity of equity had ended. The separate identity of the trust, however, continued as strongly as before. In other parts of the Commonwealth (or the British Empire at the time) trust law principles, as then understood, were codified for the purpose of easy administration. The best example is the Indian Trusts Act 1882, which described a trust as meaning [...] "an obligation annexed to the ownership of property, and arising out of a confidence reposed in and accepted by the bearer".|$|E
