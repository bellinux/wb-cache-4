5|$|In humans, other mammals, and birds, <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> {{divided into}} four chambers: upper left and right atria; and lower left and right {{ventricle}}s. Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart. Fish, in contrast, have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles have three chambers. In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves, which prevent backflow. <b>The</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains {{a small amount of}} fluid. The wall of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> {{a muscular}} organ in most animals, which pumps blood through {{the blood vessels}} of the circulatory system. Blood {{provides}} the body with oxygen and nutrients, as well as assists in the removal of metabolic wastes. In humans, <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> located between the lungs, in the middle compartment of the chest.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> cone-shaped, {{with its}} base {{positioned}} upwards and tapering {{down to the}} apex. An adult heart has a mass of 250–350 grams (9–12oz). <b>The</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> typically {{the size of a}} fist: 12cm (5in) in length, 8cm (3.5in) wide, and 6cm (2.5in) in thickness. Well-trained athletes can have much larger hearts due to the effects of exercise on the heart muscle, similar to the response of skeletal muscle.|$|E
5000|$|A {{subset of}} the primary tumors of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>are</b> tumors that are found on the valves of <b>the</b> <b>heart.</b> Tumors that affect the valves of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>are</b> found in an equal {{distribution}} among <b>the</b> four <b>heart</b> valves. [...] <b>The</b> vast majority of these are papillary fibroelastomas. Primary tumors of the valves of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>are</b> {{more likely to occur}} in males. While most primary tumors of the valves of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>are</b> not malignant, {{they are more likely to}} have symptoms related to the valve, including neurologic symptoms and (in a few cases) sudden cardiac death.|$|R
50|$|Primary tumors of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>are</b> {{extremely}} rare tumors {{that arise from}} the normal tissues that make up <b>the</b> <b>heart.</b> This <b>is</b> in contrast to secondary tumors of <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> which <b>are</b> typically either metastatic from {{another part of the}} body, or infiltrate <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> via direct extension from the surrounding tissues.|$|R

5|$|The {{innermost}} {{layer of}} <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> called the endocardium. It {{is made up}} of a lining of simple squamous epithelium, and covers heart chambers and valves. It is continuous with the endothelium of the veins and arteries of the heart, and is joined to the myocardium with a thin layer of connective tissue. The endocardium, by secreting endothelins, may also play a role in regulating the contraction of the myocardium.|$|E

500|$|An {{important}} part of the concept of the soul in Ancient Egyptian religion was thought to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> or ib. <b>The</b> ib or metaphysical <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> believed to be formed from one drop of blood from <b>the</b> child's mother's <b>heart,</b> taken at conception. To ancient Egyptians, <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> seat of emotion, thought, will, and intention. This is evidenced by Egyptian expressions which incorporate the word ib, such as Awi-ib for [...] "happy" [...] (literally, [...] "long of heart"), Xak-ib for [...] "estranged" [...] (literally, [...] "truncated of heart"). In Egyptian religion, <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> key to the afterlife. It was conceived as surviving death in the nether world, where it gave evidence for, or against, its possessor. It <b>was</b> thought that <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> examined by Anubis and a variety of deities during the Weighing of <b>the</b> <b>Heart</b> ceremony. If <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> weighed more than the feather of Maat, which symbolized the ideal standard of behavior.

5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. First, the father's semen curdles the mother's menses, which Aristotle compares with how rennet (an enzyme from a cow's stomach) curdles milk in cheesemaking. This forms the embryo; {{it is then}} {{developed}} {{by the action of}} the pneuma (literally, breath or spirit) in the semen. The pneuma first makes the heart appear; this is vital, as the heart nourishes all other organs. Aristotle observed that <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> the first organ seen to be active (beating) in a hen's egg. The pneuma then makes the other organs develop.|$|E

5|$|When airways are damaged, air {{can escape}} {{from them and}} be trapped in the {{surrounding}} tissues in the neck (subcutaneous emphysema) and mediastinum (pneumomediastinum); if it builds up to high enough pressures there, it can compress the airways. Massive air leaks from a ruptured airway can also compromise the circulation by preventing blood from returning to the heart from the head and lower body; this causes a potentially deadly reduction {{in the amount of}} blood <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> able to pump out. Blood and other fluids can build up in the airways, and the injury can interfere with the patency of the airway and interfere with its continuity. However, even if the trachea is completely transected, the tissues surrounding it may hold it together enough for adequate air exchange to occur, at least at first.|$|E

5|$|Heart {{failure is}} where the heart can't beat out enough blood {{to meet the needs}} of the body. It is {{generally}} a chronic condition, associated with age, that progresses gradually. Each side of the heart can fail independently of the other, resulting in heart failure of the right heart or the left heart. Left heart failure can also lead to right heart failure (cor pulmonale) by increasing strain on the right heart. If <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> unable to pump sufficient blood, it may accumulate throughout the body, causing breathlessness in the lungs (pulmonary congestion; pulmonary edema), swelling (edema) of the feet or other gravity-dependent areas, decrease exercise tolerance, or cause other clinical signs such as an enlarged liver, cardiac murmurs, or a raised jugular venous pressure. Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, valve disorders and diseases of cardiac muscle.|$|E

5|$|Like other arthropods, spiders are coelomates {{in which}} the coelom is reduced to small areas round the {{reproductive}} and excretory systems. Its place is largely taken by a hemocoel, a cavity that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows. <b>The</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> a tube in {{the upper part of the}} body, with a few ostia that act as non-return valves allowing blood to enter the heart from the hemocoel but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front end. However, in spiders, it occupies only the upper part of the abdomen, and blood is discharged into the hemocoel by one artery that opens at the rear end of the abdomen and by branching arteries that pass through the pedicle and open into several parts of the cephalothorax. Hence spiders have open circulatory systems. The blood of many spiders that have book lungs contains the respiratory pigment hemocyanin to make oxygen transport more efficient.|$|E
5|$|Snow and the Huntsman walk {{together}} in the forest, and she sees through his disguise and correctly guesses that he was sent by the Queen to kill her. Snow flees, but as the Huntsman catches up with her, he finds her writing a letter, which she requests he deliver to the queen after she is killed. The Huntsman takes out his knife, but instead of killing her, he fashions a whistle out of a bamboo stick, telling her that it will summon help and then telling her to run. The Huntsman then returns to the queen with a deer heart, hoping that she will not know the difference. The queen asks him to read her the letter, which is an apology for past wrongs {{as well as a}} request from Snow that her stepmother rule the kingdom with compassion. The queen burns the letter and takes the box with the heart in it to store in her vault. When she cannot open one of her storage safes, it proves that the Huntsman lied to her; <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> not human. The Queen has her guards drag him down to the vault and she yanks his glowing heart out of his body. She tells the Huntsman that from now on he will be her pet and will do her bidding forever, and if he ever betrays her, all she has to do is squeeze.|$|E
5|$|Twice Through <b>the</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>is</b> {{based on}} a 1992 poetry {{documentary}} {{of the same name}} that Kay had written for the BBC television series Words on Film. Kay was concerned by inequalities in how the legal system treats men and women who kill their spouses and, in particular, in how the law on provocation in the United Kingdom was then interpreted, allowing a defence to murder only in the context of what happened immediately before a homicide and excluding the battered woman defence which considers the broader context which may have involved years of violent abuse. She chose to base the poems on a specific true case, that of Amelia Rossiter, a woman in her sixties who refused to give evidence in court about the years of violence from her husband that eventually led to her stabbing him twice through the heart with a kitchen knife. By the time Kay's programme was broadcast, Rossiter had been freed, her conviction reduced to manslaughter after her plea of provocation was accepted.|$|E

5|$|The {{conventions}} of Moonlight are based, in part, on a unique mythology. Some {{parts of the}} mythology that are common include a sire, that is the vampire who turns a human into a vampire; though in the show the sire must teach him or her how to live as one. A vampire's bite {{is not enough to}} turn a human into a vampire; the human, when near death, must drink the sire's blood or have vampire blood in his or her system at the moment of death. The process of vampirization also affects their genetics, causing their DNA to be fundamentally altered to suit their bodies' new state. This makes genetic testing between vampires and their human relatives impossible unless the vampire has a sample of their own human DNA from before they were turned, such as a lock of hair. They must consume human blood to survive. They also develop psychic powers and can glimpse the future and the past. This ability, along with their night vision, is an extension of their heightened senses. Daylight does not kill vampires, but does make them progressively weaker. Silver and fire are toxic, whereas garlic, holy water and crucifixes are useless. A vampire's image cannot be captured with analogue cameras containing silver emulsion in the film; digital cameras are able to capture an image because they do not use silver emulsion. Though undead, vampires have a pulse, are not cold blooded (but still don't produce body heat as seen in episode 11 so as heat signature cameras won't see them), and cannot turn into a bat. The best ways to kill them are by decapitation or burning; a stake through <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> painful but only causes paralysis. Moonlight vampires have many of the preternatural abilities as described in vampire mythology; they have superhuman strength and speed, they heal rapidly from any wound, they can defy gravity to a limited degree to perform parkour feats, their bite has hypnotic effects on weak-minded humans, and they are immortal. Their powers increase as they get older. Their blood has drug-like affects when consumed by humans; causing euphoria and temporarily heightened senses.|$|E
