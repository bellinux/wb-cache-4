The Cantometrics teaching tapes are the best thing anybody can use who wants to understand world music, classical music, pop music, whatever. That teaching kit teaches you about the qualities of music – any kind of music from any culture.” ...|$|E

When I came down to see the mole, I found you in such a state of mind as to take pleasure in Caleb's suffering. <b>You</b> <b>wanted</b> to prove that he had told a lie, and looked disappointed when I shewed you that he had not. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to prove he had disobeyed me, when, after all, you knew very well that he had not." ...|$|R
60|$|The idea of {{your house}} going to the wanton expense of a flower garden!--aren't you enough? And {{what do you want}} to go and {{discourage}} the other flowers for? Is that the right spirit? is it considerate? is it kind? How do you suppose they feel when you come around--looking the way you look? And you so pink and sweet and dainty and lovely and supernatural? Why, it makes them feel embarrassed and artificial, of course; and in my opinion it is just as pathetic as it can be. Now <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to reform--dear--and do right.|$|E
60|$|But impromptu speaking--that is what I {{was trying}} to learn. That is a {{difficult}} thing. I {{used to do it}} in this way. I used to begin about a week ahead, and write out my impromptu, speech and get it by heart. Then I brought it to the New England dinner printed {{on a piece of paper}} in my pocket, so that I could pass it to the reporters all cut and dried, and in order to do an impromptu speech as it should be done you have to indicate the places for pauses and hesitations. I put them all in it. And <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> the applause in the right places.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well;--I {{will be in}} earnest. I shall {{take the}} first that comes after I have quite made up my mind. You'll think it very horrible, but that is really what I shall do. After all, a husband {{is very much like}} a house or a horse. You don't take your house because it's the best house in the world, but because just <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> a house. You go and see a house, and if it's very nasty you don't take it. But if you think it will suit pretty well, and if you are tired of looking about for houses, you do take it. That's the way one buys one's horses,--and one's husbands." ...|$|E

That's where many good farmers fail. Bank your surplus and you get market interest, but nothing for your {{knowledge}} and experience. The money ought {{to be put into}} new teams and the latest machines, and after that into breaking new land. If you make a profit on two hundred acres, you'll increase it by a third when you break a hundred acres more, not to mention what you save by working on a larger scale. Well, I see what could be done with a united Allenwood where every man worked jointly with the rest, but the settlement needs a head." ...|$|E

Don't you be took in by no new saw because it's bright, and looks pretty. You want to take a saw that's been filed, and filed away till it ain't more 'n {{an inch and a half}} deep; and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to tune it up, just so,--like a banjo--not too tight, and not too slack,--and then it'll slip through a stick o' wood like--lyin'." [...] He {{selected}} a saw, and put it in order for Lemuel. [...] "There!" [...] He picked out another. [...] "Here's my old stand-by!" [...] He took up a saw-horse, at random, to indicate that one need not be critical in that, and led through the open door into the wood-yard, where a score or two of saws were already shrilling and wheezing through the wood.|$|E

But if you had not been a cultivated man, Templeton, a man with few sorrows, and few trials, and few unsatisfied desires-if you had been the village shopkeeper, with his bad debts, and his temptations to make those who can pay for those who cannot,-if you had been one of your own labourers, environed with the struggle for daily bread, and the alehouse, and hungry children, and a sick wife, and a dull taste, and a duller head-in short, if you had been a man such as nine out of ten are- what would his school have taught you <b>then?</b> <b>You</b> <b>want</b> some truths which are common to men as men, which will help and teach them, let their temperament or their circumstances be what they will-do you not?

It ain't any trouble, because it's the first land you'll strike {{the other side of}} the Atlantic. If it's daytime when you strike it, bulge right on, straight west from the upper part of the Florida coast, and in an hour and three quarters you'll hit the mouth of the Mississippi--at the speed that I'm going to send you. You'll be so high up in the air that the earth will be curved considerable--sorter like a washbowl turned upside down--and you'll see a raft of rivers crawling around every which way, long before you get there, and you can pick out the Mississippi without any trouble. Then you can follow the river north nearly, an hour and three quarters, till you see the Ohio come in; <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to look sharp, because you're getting near. Away up to your left you'll see another thread coming in--that's the Missouri and is a little above St. Louis. You'll come down low then, so as you can examine the villages as you spin along.

6000|$|But {{she had her}} hours, thus, {{of feeling}} supremely linked {{to him by the}} rigour of their law, and when it came over her that, all the while, the wish, on his side, to spare her might be what most worked with him, this very fact of their seeming to have nothing [...] "inward" [...] really to talk about wrapped him up for her in a kind of {{sweetness}} that was wanting, as a consecration, even in her yearning for her husband. She was powerless, however, was only more utterly hushed, when the interrupting flash came, when she would have been all ready to say to him, [...] "Yes, this is by every appearance the best time we've had yet; but don't you see, all the same, how they must be working together for it, and how my very success, my success in shifting our beautiful harmony to a new basis, comes round to being their success, above all; their cleverness, their amiability, their power to hold out, their complete possession, in short, of our life?" [...] For how could she say as much as that without saying a great deal more? without saying [...] "They'll do everything in the world that suits us, save only one thing--prescribe a line for us that will make them separate." [...] How could she so much as imagine herself even faintly murmuring that without putting into his mouth the very words that would have made her quail? [...] "Separate, my dear? Do you want them to separate? <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> US to--you and me? For how can the one separation take place without the other?" [...] That was the question that, in spirit, she had heard him ask--with its dread train, moreover, of involved and connected inquiries. Their own separation, his and hers, was of course perfectly thinkable, but only {{on the basis of the}} sharpest of reasons. Well, the sharpest, the very sharpest, would be that they could no longer afford, as it were, he to let his wife, she to let her husband, [...] "run" [...] them in such compact formation. And say they accepted this account of their situation as a practical finality, acting upon it and proceeding to a division, would no sombre ghosts of the smothered past, on either side, show, across the widening strait, pale unappeased faces, or raise, in the very passage, deprecating, denouncing hands? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "--executive power," [...] he {{was saying}} as Lydia entered. [...] "That's a very good expression, gentlemen, and one that I can tell you a lot about. We {{have been told that}} if we want to civilize our neighbors we must do it mainly by the example of our own lives, by each {{becoming}} a living illustration of the highest culture we know. But what I ask is, how is anybody to know that you're an illustration of culture. You can't go about like a sandwich man with a label on your back to tell all the fine notions you have in your head; and you may be sure no person will consider your mere appearance preferable to his own. You want an executive power; that's what you want. Suppose you walked along the street and saw a man beating a woman, and setting a bad example to the roughs. Well, you would be bound to set a good example to them; and, if you're men, you'd like to save the woman; but you couldn't do it by merely living; for that would be setting the bad example of passing on and leaving the poor creature to be beaten. What is it that you need to know then, in order to act up to your fine ideas? Why, {{you want to know how}} to hit him, when to hit him, and where to hit him; and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> the nerve to go in and do it. That's executive power; and that's what's wanted worse than sitting down and thinking how good you are, which is what this gentleman's teaching comes to after all. Don't you see? You want executive power to set an example. If you leave all that to the roughs, it's their example that will spread, and not yours. And look at the politics of it. We've heard a good deal about the French to-night. Well, they've got executive power. They know how to make a barricade, and how to fight behind it when they've made it. What's the result? Why, the French, if they only knew what they wanted, could have it to-morrow for the asking--more's the pity that they don't know. In this country we can do nothing; and if the lords and the landlords, or any other collection of nobs, were to drive us into the sea, what could we do but go? There's a gentleman laughing at me for saying that; but I ask him what would he do if the police or the soldiers came this evening and told him to turn out of his comfortable house into the Thames? Tell 'em he wouldn't vote for their employers at the next election, perhaps? Or, if that didn't stop them, tell 'em that he'd ask his friends to do the same? That's a pretty executive power! No, gentlemen. Don't let yourself be deceived by people that have staked their money against you. The first thing to learn is how to fight. There's no use in buying books and pictures unless you know how to keep them and your own head as well. If that gentleman that laughed know how to fight, and his neighbors all knew how to fight too, he wouldn't need to fear police, nor soldiers, nor Russians, nor Prussians, nor any of the millions of men that may be let loose on him any day of the week, safe though he thinks himself. But, says you, let's have a division of labor. Let's not fight for ourselves, but pay other men to fight for us. That shows how some people, when they get hold of an idea, will work it to that foolish length that it's wearisome to listen to them. Fighting is the power of self-preservation; another man can't do it for you. You might as well divide the labor of eating your dinner, and pay one fellow to take the beef, another the beer, and a third the potatoes. But let us put it for the sake of argument that you do pay others to fight for you. Suppose some one else pays them higher, and they fight a cross, or turn openly against you! You'd have only yourself to blame for giving the executive power to money. And so long as the executive power is money the poor will be kept out of their corner and fouled against the ropes; whereas, by what I understand, the German professor wants them to have their rights. Therefore I say that a man's first duty is to learn to fight. If he can't do that he can't set an example; he can't stand up for his own rights or his neighbors'; he can't keep himself in bodily health; and if he sees the weak ill-used by the strong, the most he can do is to sneak away and tell the nearest policeman, who most likely won't turn up until the worst of the mischief is done. Coming to this lady's drawing-room, and making an illustration of himself, won't make him feel like a man after that. Let me be understood, though, gentlemen: I don't intend that you should take everything I say too exactly--too literally, as it were. If you see a man beating a woman, I think you should interfere on principle. But don't expect to be thanked by her for it; and keep your eye on her; don't let her get behind you. As for him, just give him a good one and go away. Never stay to get yourself into a street fight; for it's low, and generally turns out badly for all parties. However, that's only a bit of practical advice. It doesn't alter the great principle that you should get an executive power. When you get that, you'll have courage in you; and, what's more, your courage will be of some use to you. For though you may have courage by nature, still, if you haven't executive power as well, your courage will only lead you to stand up to be beaten by men that have both courage and executive power; and what good does that do you? People say that you're a game fellow; but they won't find the stakes for you unless you can win them. You'd far better put your game in your pocket, and throw up the sponge while you can see to do it.|$|E
