25|$|With the {{exception}} of the two request halts (Country Park and Northwood), all intermediate stations have the ability to pass trains on the single line. However, Highley's passing loop lacks a platform and Facing Point Locks on points <b>to</b> <b>attached</b> sidings, a legal requirement for passenger-carrying line, meaning trains carrying fare-paying passengers may not use this loop. However, it is frequently used for works trains, demonstration goods trains and empty stock workings. Despite this, the Severn Valley Railway offers, possibly, the most intensive service on any single line heritage railway.|$|E

Algae ranges from single floating cells <b>to</b> <b>attached</b> seaweeds, while vascular plants are represented in the ocean by {{groups such as the}} seagrasses. Larger producers, such as seagrasses and seaweeds, are mostly confined to the littoral zone and shallow waters, where they attach to the underlying substrate and still be within the photic zone. Most primary production in the ocean is performed by microscopic organisms, the phytoplankton.|$|E

Even though USB 3.0's 4.5W is sometimes insufficient to power external hard drives, technology is advancing and external drives gradually need less power, diminishing the eSATA advantage. eSATAp (power over eSATA; aka ESATA/USB) is a connector introduced in 2009 that supplies power <b>to</b> <b>attached</b> devices using a new, backward compatible, connector. On a notebook eSATAp usually supplies only 5V to power a 2.5-inch HDD/SSD; on a desktop workstation it can additionally supply 12V to power larger devices including 3.5-inch HDD/SSD and 5.25-inch optical drives.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{reversal}} of the pattern on land, in the oceans, almost all photosynthesis is performed by algae, with a small fraction contributed by vascular plants and other groups. [...] Algae encompass a diverse range of organisms, ranging from single floating cells <b>to</b> <b>attached</b> seaweeds. [...] They include photoautotrophs from a variety of groups. [...] Eubacteria are important photosynthetizers in both oceanic and terrestrial ecosystems, and while some archaea are phototrophic, none are known to utilise oxygen-evolving photosynthesis. [...] A number of eukaryotes are significant contributors to primary production in the ocean, including green algae, brown algae and red algae, and a diverse group of unicellular groups. [...] Vascular plants are also represented in the ocean by groups such as the seagrasses.|$|E

2500|$|The National Language Promotion Department ( [...] — , [...] ), {{formerly}} known as the National Language Authority (or Urdu Language Authority) is an autonomous regulatory institution established in 1979 to support the advancement and promotion of Urdu which is the national language of Pakistan. Its status now has been changed <b>to</b> <b>attached</b> department. Initially it was aimed at creating a synergy between national and provincial governments and institutions for using Urdu language. However, with time, it expanded its horizons to include standardisation and linguistic aspects such as orthography and lexicography. It also provides recommendations for maximizing use of the language in all walks of life. In this respect, large amounts of legal and scientific documents are translated from English and other languages for publication into Urdu. These efforts have resulted in greater awareness of the language's potential as well as its localisation. Recently, the status and name of organization has been changed from National Language Authority to National Language Promotion Department. The National Language Promotion Department is now an attached department of Ministry of National Heritage & Integration.Renowned Short-Story Writer and Educationist Dr. Anwaar Ahmad was the last Chairman of the NLA, as the post has been converted to Director General (D.G).|$|E
2500|$|The Domesday Book {{initiated}} by WilliamI of England in 1086 was a government survey {{on all the}} administrative counties of England; {{it was used to}} assess the properties of farmsteads and landholders in order to tax them sufficiently. In the survey, numerous English castles were listed; scholars debate on exactly how many were actually referenced in the book. However, the Domesday Book does detail the fact that out of 3,558 registered houses destroyed in 112 different boroughs listed, 410 of these destroyed houses were the direct result of castle construction and expansion. In 1316 the Nomina Villarum survey was {{initiated by}} Edward II of England; it was essentially {{a list of all the}} administrative subdivisions throughout England which could be utilized by the state in order to assess how much military troops could be conscripted and summoned from each region. The Speculum Britanniae (1596) of the Tudor era English cartographer and topographer John Norden (1548–1625) had an alphabetical list of places throughout England with headings showing their administrative hundreds and referenced <b>to</b> <b>attached</b> maps. Englishman John Speed's Theatre of the Empire of Great Britaine published in 1611 provided gazetteers for counties throughout England, which included illustrative maps, short local histories, a list of administrative hundreds, an index of parishes, and the coordinates of longitude and latitude for county towns. Starting in 1662, the Hearth Tax Returns with attached maps of local areas were compiled by individual parishes throughout England while a duplicate of their records were sent to the central government offices of the Exchequer. To supplement his [...] "new large Map of England" [...] from 1677, the English cartographer John Adams compiled the extensive gazetteer [...] "Index Villaris" [...] in 1680 that had some 24,000 places listed with geographical coordinates coinciding with the map. The [...] "Geographical Dictionary" [...] of Edmund Bohun was published in London in 1688, comprising 806 pages with some 8,500 entries. In his work, Edmund Bohun attributed the first known Western geographical dictionary to geographer Stephanus of Byzantium (fl. 6th century) while also noting influence in his work from the Thesaurus Geographicus (1587) by the Belgian cartographer Abraham Ortelius (1527–1598), but stated that Ortelius' work dealt largely with ancient geography and not up-to-date information. Only fragments of Stephanus' geographical work Ethnica (Εθνικά) have survived and were first examined by the Italian printer Aldus Manutius in his work of 1502.|$|E
