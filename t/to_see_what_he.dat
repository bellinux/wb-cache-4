Some {{have pointed out}} that he qualified his statements on the constitution with the statement that this is a personal suggestion. Furthermore, it is widely believed in Taiwan that some of these gestures were essentially forced on him again by pressure from the United States and the PRC. The PRC has stated many times that it cares little about what Chen says, but will watch closely {{in the next few months}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> does, a standard sentence that Communist China continues to quote.|$|E

But the guard had spotted the down signals all off; thoroughly alarmed, he began running forward and shouting, and presently Lauderdale heard him and stopped. But {{it was too late}} then to do anything. The express was 200 yards away, coming 40 miles an hour. No. 139's crew cleared out and went over the wall, and the express went head on into 139. It was quite a bad smash. The guard and two passengers were killed. The fireman and another passenger died later. The driver escaped with severe bruising. There was very nearly another collision immediately after, for a Caley mineral from Lesmahagow was coming on the Down Goods line. Its driver saw the crash occur and managed to pull up just in time.|$|E

The Rockies promoted Pérez to triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox {{at the end of}} the 1995 season with the intention of bringing him up to the major leagues the next year. In fact, although Pérez was invited to 1996 spring training, he spent most of year with the Sky Sox and was not called up until the end of August, making his major league debut on August 31. In his season with the Sky Sox, his batting average had improved to [...]316. Commented Rockies manager Don Baylor: [...] "He is the guy who had the year that traditionally earns a call up.

[...] Campbell ordered Sir James Baird to take 350 light infantry and 250 New York Loyalists and follow the slave through the swamp, while he arrayed his troops just out of view {{in a way that would}} give the impression he would attempt a flanking maneuver on Howe's left. [...] One of his officers climbed a tree to observe Baird's progress. [...] True to the slave's word, the trail came out near the Continental barracks, which had been left unguarded; the Continentals were unaware they had been flanked.

In October, Judy Greer entered negotiations to play Laurie's daughter Karen Strode. The film will be distributed by Universal Pictures, their first involvement in the franchise since distributing 1982's Halloween III: Season of the Witch. On October 17, 2017, Carpenter announced that he would be returning to score the upcoming film, saying [...] "I’ll be consulting with the director <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> feels.

500|$|A {{stoppage}} time penalty from Shane Long {{earned a}} crucial 2–1 win for Reading in Argyle's next match, but {{they came from}} a goal behind to claim a 3–1 victory at Barnsley four days later, which included a 35-yard effort from former Barnsley player Fallon. Paul Mariner was full of praise for his team and singled out youngster Yannick Bolasie, who made his debut for the club. [...] "We played with intellect. We got the ball down, rather than panicking a little bit; we stroked it around; we retained position at vital times," [...] he said. [...] "The introduction of Bolasie was {{a breath of fresh}} air. I think even the Barnsley fans would probably say they liked <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing. He brought a lot to the table for us." [...] A double-header of home matches were next on the agenda for Argyle, against Swansea City and Leicester City, and they both ended in 1–1 draws. New signing Damien Johnson scored late on against Swansea, and Craig Noone scored his first goal of the season to earn a point against Leicester. An end-to-end game at Bramall Lane against Sheffield United ended in a 4–3 defeat, which included a number of defensive mistakes. Argyle went 3–0 before finally sparking into life, scoring twice thanks to Bolasie and a first for young Irish striker Joe Mason. A lapse in concentration from David Stockdale, on loan from Fulham, gifted the hosts a fourth goal before a 20-yard volley from Mackie set up a frantic finale. In the aftermath, Paul Mariner heaped praise on Mason, describing him as [...] "an incredible talent." ...|$|E

After leaving the hop, Curt is coerced by a group of greasers ("The Pharaohs") to participate in an initiation rite that involves hooking a chain to a police car and ripping out its back axle. The Pharaohs tell Curt that [...] "The Blonde" [...] is a trophy wife or prostitute, but he refuses to believe either. Determined to get a message to the blonde girl, Curt drives to the local radio station to ask DJ Wolfman Jack, who is omnipresent on the car radios, to announce a message for the blonde girl. Inside the radio station, Curt encounters a bearded man who tells him that the voice of The Wolfman is pre-taped from afar. The man still accepts the message from Curt <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could do. As he is leaving the station, Curt sees the man talking into the microphone and hears the voice of The Wolfman, and realizes the man is the actual DJ himself. Sure enough, The Wolfman eventually reads the message on the radio for [...] "The Blonde" [...] to meet Curt or call him at a number which happens to be a telephone booth.

500|$|Will & Grace creators Max Mutchnick and David Kohan based {{the show}} on their own lives. Mutchnick, who is openly gay, based the {{relationship}} between Will and Grace on his real-life relationship with a woman named Janet. Originally, Mutchnick and Kohan first went to the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), who told them to create a television series about a new young love story, as Mad About You was going off the air. The character of Will {{was part of a}} sitcom Mutchnick and Kohan first pitched to NBC executives in 1997. The original concept was an ensemble comedy featuring three couples, one of which was a gay man living with a straight woman. Warren Littlefield, the executive vice president of NBC at the time, was not excited about the first two couples, but wanted {{to learn more about the}} gay and straight couple, so Mutchnick and Kohan was sent to create a pilot script centering on those two characters. NBC went to sitcom director James Burrows <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thought of the homosexual subject matter and if an audience would be interested in the show. Burrows liked the idea and when he first read the script in November 1997, he decided that he wanted to direct it. Burrows said, [...] "I knew that the boys had captured a genre and a group of characters I have never read before." [...] The filming of the pilot began in March 1998. The actors who played Will and Grace, Eric McCormack and Debra Messing, were positive about the series and they thought it had the potential to last on television. McCormack said, [...] "When shooting was finished that night, Debra and I were sitting on the couch and looking at each other and I said, ‘We’re gonna be on this set for a while.’ And we sort of clasped hands, but we didn’t want to say anything beyond that and jinx it." ...|$|E
