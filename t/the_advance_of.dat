5|$|The II SS-Panzer Corps {{continued}} its attack toward Prokhorovka on 11 July. <b>The</b> <b>advance</b> <b>of</b> Leibstandarte was checked by the 2nd Tank Corps, {{which had been}} reinforced by the 9th Guards Airborne Division and 301st Anti-tank Artillery Regiment, both from the 33rd Guards Rifle Corps. Totenkopf was resisted by the 31st Tank Corps, the 33rd Guards Rifle Corps' 95th Guards Rifle Division, and the 11th Motorized Rifle Brigade of the 10th Tank Corps. To the south of Leibstandarte, the 2nd Guards Tank Corps and the 48th Rifle Corps' 183rd Rifle Division opposed <b>the</b> <b>advance</b> <b>of</b> Das Reich.|$|E

His reforms of the government reduced the corruption which had taken hold in Phocas's reign, and he reorganized the military with great success. Ultimately, the reformed Imperial army halted the Muslims in Asia Minor and held on to Carthage for another 60 years, saving a core from which the empire's strength could be rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time, Belaur, a brother of Michael Asen III, rebelled in Vidin, {{probably}} {{in support of his}} deposed nephew Ivan Stefan's claim to the throne. <b>The</b> <b>advance</b> <b>of</b> the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos against Bulgaria in the summer of 1332 protracted military operations against the rebels. The Byzantines overran Bulgarian-controlled northeastern Thrace, but Ivan Alexander rushed southward with a small army and swiftly caught up with Andronikos III at Rusokastro.|$|E
5|$|During July, two {{additional}} divisions were consolidated under Maj. Gen. Burnside's command {{to form the}} IX Corps. At the beginning of August, Brig.

5|$|In September 1944, the Hungarian {{authorities}} began evacuating the Székelys {{settled in}} the occupied territories since 1941 to Transdanubia. Several days after the Soviet Red Army entered the Banat on 1 October 1944, the Germans began the evacuation of Bačka, including the local Volksdeutsche.

The Germans however, failed to capture the main bridge intact, forcing them to delay the crossing by the 4th Panzer Division until the next day.|$|E

5|$|In {{this type}} of legion, the 900 principes formed 15 maniples, {{military}} units of 60 men each. The principes stood in the second battle line, behind hastati of the first line {{and in front of}} the triarii in the third.

5|$|Malloum's {{reaction}} to the Goukouni–Gaddafi offensive was to sever diplomatic relations with Libya on 6 February and bring before the UN Security Council the issue of Libyan involvement.

5|$|Pitched battles were {{conducted}} in a similar fashion: the velites would gather at the front and fling javelins to cover <b>the</b> <b>advance</b> <b>of</b> the hastati. If the hastati failed to break the enemy, they would fall back on the principes, who along with the hastati, had been re-equipped with pila rather than spears. If the principes could not break the enemy they would retire behind the triarii, who would then engage the enemy.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Netherlands {{saw some}} of the {{earliest}} mass paratroop drops, to occupy tactical points and assist <b>the</b> <b>advance</b> <b>of</b> ground troops.

5|$|The British instigated a new {{offensive}} on 25 September, at Loos, {{to coincide}} with French offensives in the Champagne and Artois regions. The King's were represented in the offensive by eight battalions, from standard infantry to pioneers. Some 150 tons of Chlorine gas was used {{on the first day}} of the battle, discharged via thousands of cylinders. Strong winds blew the gas backwards, hindering <b>the</b> <b>advance</b> <b>of</b> the 1st King's and other units having to also contend with partially uncut barbed wire. <b>The</b> <b>advance</b> <b>of</b> the 1/9th King's also stalled, though they took about 300 Germans prisoner. The battalion later assisted in the repulse of a German counter-attack on 8 October. More battalions arrived before the year ended, including the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th Liverpool Pals, which formed the 89th Brigade, 30th Division.|$|E

5|$|The British moved three fresh brigades {{up to the}} Red Line by 9:30am on 10 April {{to support}} <b>the</b> <b>advance</b> <b>of</b> the 1st and 2nd Canadian Division, whereupon they were to {{leapfrog}} existing units occupying the Red line and advance to the Blue Line. Fresh units including two sections of tanks and the 13th British Brigade were called up from reserve to support <b>the</b> <b>advance</b> <b>of</b> the 2nd Canadian Division. By approximately 11:00am, the Blue Line, including Hill 135 and the village of Thélus, had been captured. To permit the troops time to consolidate the Blue Line, the advance halted and the barrage remained stationary for 90 minutes while machine guns were brought forward. Shortly before 1:00pm, the advance recommenced with both the 1st and 2nd Canadian Divisions reporting their final objective. The tank-supported advance via Farbus and directed {{at the rear of}} the 79th Reserve Division, was eventually halted by concentrated German fire short of the village. The Canadian 1st and 2nd Divisions were nonetheless able to secure the Brown Line by approximately 2:00pm.|$|E

Meanwhile, their extensive programme of fortifications has left an enduring mark upon the Anatolian landscape, which can still be appreciated today.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle at}} Catraeth {{has been seen}} as an attempt to resist <b>the</b> <b>advance</b> <b>of</b> the Angles, who had {{probably}} by then occupied the former Votadini lands of Bryneich in modern north-eastern England and made it their kingdom of Bernicia.
