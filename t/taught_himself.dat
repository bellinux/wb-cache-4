5|$|Thomas's early poetry {{was noted}} for its verbal density, alliteration, sprung rhythm and {{internal}} rhyme, and he was described by some critics as having {{been influenced by the}} English poet Gerard Manley Hopkins.

When Henry Treece wrote to Thomas comparing his style to that of Hopkins, Thomas wrote back denying any such influence. One poet Thomas greatly admired, and who is regarded as an influence, was Thomas Hardy. When Thomas travelled in America, he recited Hardy's work in his readings.|$|E
