30|$|Although the {{two studies}} are the first attempt that draws on a large sample of {{university}} students to explore the complex relationships among the English graduation benchmark policy, test value, learning motivation, test anxiety, and test performance, it {{has a number of}} limitations. First, these studies only used data of students from three universities that have established passing the GEPT High-Intermediate Level <b>Test</b> (<b>equivalent</b> to the CEFR B 2) and the GEPT Intermediate Level <b>Test</b> (<b>equivalent</b> to the CEFR B 1), as their English graduation benchmark policy. The sampled students, especially the High-Intermediate group, tend to show a strong learning motivation and autonomous learning behavior; thus, their attitudes towards the graduation benchmark policy are also positive and optimistic. Consequently, more data are needed to support whether {{the findings of this study}} can be applied to universities that use other forms of English proficiency testing tools as their graduation benchmark requirement. In view of this, we suggest that future researchers can gather data from a large sample of universities that use the other two levels of the GEPT, i.e., elementary (equivalent to the CEFR A 2) and advanced (equivalent to the CEFR C 1), or other tests (e.g., TOEIC, IELTS) as their graduation benchmark requirement. Second, in addition to using SEM to analyze the relationships among latent variables, hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) can also be applied when there is a larger amount of data. Factors such as the student’s department and school can be integrated into the analysis, as these factors are important elements that are likely to influence one’s attitude towards the English graduation benchmark policy. Third, open-ended questions should be included in the questionnaire to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the views of university students towards the English graduation benchmark policy, as well as how their English learning process is influenced by the implementation of this policy.|$|R

40|$|Abstract This article {{introduces}} {{the application of}} Equivalence Hypothesis Test-ing (EHT) into the Empirical Software Engineering field. Equivalence (also known as bioequivalence in pharmacological studies) is a statistical approach that answers the question ‘is product <b>T</b> <b>equivalent</b> to some other reference product R within some range ∆?’. The approach of “null hypothesis significance test ” used tradi-tionally in Empirical Software Engineering seeks to assess evidence for differences between T and R, not equivalence. In this paper we explain how EHT can be applied in Software Engineering, thereby extending it from its current application within pharmacological studies, to Empirical Software Engineering. We illustrate the application of EHT to Empir-ical Software Engineering, by re-examining the behaviour of experts and novices when handling code with side effects compared to side effect free code; a study pre-viously investigated using traditional statistical testing.

The {{first step in the}} nanocasting process involves impregnation of zeolite 13 X with furfuryl alcohol and the second step consists of chemical vapour deposition (CVD) of ethylene at 700 °C. Zeolite-like structural ordering was achieved for zeolite templated carbons (ZTCs) prepared at variable heating ramp rates of 5, 10 or 15 °C/min. The textural properties of ZTCs prepared at all heating ramp rates were comparable with small variations in which the lowest ramp rate (5 °C/min) generated ZTC with highest surface area and pore volume of 3332 m 2 /g and 1. 66 cm 3 /g respectively.

A total of 15 flood events were analyzed, providing extensive data on SS, POC and DOC during floods. There was high variability in SS, POC and DOC transport during different seasonal floods, with SS varying by event from 513 to 41 750 t; POC from 12 to 748 t and DOC from 9 to 218 t. Overall, 76 and 62 % of total fluxes of POC and DOC occurred within 22 % of the study period.

The relationships between SS, POC and DOC and discharge over temporal flood events resulted in different hysteresis patterns, which were used to deduce dissolved and particulate origins.
