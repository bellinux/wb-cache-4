5|$|Bach {{performed}} the cantata only once, in Leipzig's main church Nikolaikirche on 25 November 1731. According to Wolff, Bach performed it only <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>time,</b> although the 27th Sunday after Trinity occurred {{one more time}} during his tenure in Leipzig, in 1742. He used movement 4 of the cantata as the base {{for the first of}} his Schübler Chorales, BWV 645.|$|E
25|$|Moyo (Neil Patrick Harris) - Another gorilla in Tarzan's family. He once {{believed}} Tarzan cared {{more about}} Jane than the family. When Hista, an enormous red python, attacked while Tarzan was with Jane, Moyo managed to chase Hista {{away for the}} time being. When Tarzan returned, he boasted about <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>time</b> accomplishment, claimed that Tarzan was too busy being with Jane to protect the family, and challenged Tarzan for leadership of the gorillas. Moyo defeated Tarzan, though only because Tarzan had saved Moyo from an imminent death from being impaled on sharp spikes. Moyo led the family away and, by an error of judgment, they walked into a tar pit. After some conflict, Moyo and Tarzan cooperated to rescue the family and lure Hista into the tar pit, where the great snake became stuck and sank, killing him and forever ending the python's reign of terror. Moyo reconciled with Tarzan, finally seeing that Jane was part of their family, and stepped down as leader. He promised to wait until {{he was ready to}} try to become leader again. Despite his arrogance and stubbornness, when the elephants and gorillas engage in jungle warfare, Moyo plays a big part in helping Tarzan lead the gorillas to victory. Just as the gorillas are about to triumph, a fire breaks out, and Moyo is the first gorilla to follow Tarzan's lead in putting out the fire.|$|E

500|$|The Russian {{characters}} {{from the start}} of the episode came from a [...] "great" [...] Russian acting community in Vancouver, British Columbia who had defected from the Soviet Union. Both Lea and Laurie Holden were required to learn Russian for the first scene following the opening credits. Alex Shostak Jr., who portrayed Dmitri, worked 12–14 hours a day; make-up was applied to give the appearance that his eyes and mouth had been sewed up, and a small straw was pushed between his lips to give him water. During the filming of the episode, he was [...] "literally" [...] blind and guided by the crew members throughout the filming of his scenes. Shostak provided the translation for his own lines from English to Russian. Holden and Lea worked diligently together to perfect their lines in Russian. Holden explained, [...] "we'd come up with these fun ways to test ourselves to know if we had really nailed it. Show tunes come to mind, but I also remember <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>time</b> my dialect coach had me call a Russian friend of his on his cell phone to see if he could understand me. I passed the test." ...|$|E

In little more than six years from this time Bathsheba might certainly marry him.
