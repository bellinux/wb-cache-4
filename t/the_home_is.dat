5|$|Only the {{foundation}} {{remains of the}} property's windmill. What is left, ten rows of stone above the ground, is completely invisible when <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>is</b> viewed by passers-by on Lincoln Highway. The windmill started to fall into disrepair around the 1930s or 40s. The original, specific use of the windmill is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The Thomas E. Creek Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center {{is located}} east of Harrington Regional Medical Center. The {{facility}} opened in 1940 and was renamed in 2005, honoring the 18-year-old Amarillo Marine who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Construction began in 2006 {{for a new}} Texas State Veterans Home in northwest Amarillo. The United States government, through the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, provided the funding to build the facility, while the Texas government will run it after construction is completed. <b>The</b> <b>home</b> <b>is</b> {{scheduled to open in}} 2007.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> {{built in}} 1796 by Andrew Zabriskie {{as a home}} for his son John Zabriskie. <b>The</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> later used as a parsonage. In 1890 <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> {{converted}} into a tavern. The borough of Ho-Ho-Kus purchased <b>the</b> <b>home</b> in 1941 and began leasing <b>the</b> <b>home</b> as a restaurant in 1953.|$|R
50|$|After {{being passed}} on to the Schumacher's {{descendants}} <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> sold in 1967 (though it remained a private <b>home).</b> During <b>the</b> 1998 Comfrey-St. Peter tornado outbreak <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> badly damaged including the complete loss of <b>the</b> <b>home's</b> turret, roof and porch. In a yearlong restoration project aided by the Minnesota Historical Society <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> meticulously restored. <b>The</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> added to <b>the</b> National Register of Historic Places in 2000 as an excellent local example of a Queen Anne style home.|$|R
50|$|Plans for <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>were</b> {{drawn by}} Warren, Knight, and Davis Architects of Birmingham, Alabama in May, 1939. <b>The</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> {{completed}} in January, 1940.|$|R
5|$|Before Indiana {{became a}} state, the Indiana Territory had two governors. William Henry Harrison, the first governor, built a plantation-style home in Vincennes, and named it Grouseland for its many birds. Built in 1804, {{it was one}} of the first brick {{buildings}} in the territory. <b>The</b> <b>home</b> <b>is</b> still preserved and is a National Historic Landmark. Thomas Posey, the territory's second governor, had a home built in Corydon, but lived there only briefly before moving to Jeffersonville where he rented a room in a boarding house. The Posey House is preserved as part of a National Historic District.|$|E
5|$|Li {{begins to}} close in on Ah Jong after Tsang follows Fung Sei; Tsang is killed after {{revealing}} the location of his home. Because of their friendship, Fung Sei leaves a large stockpile of weaponry for Ah Jong. <b>The</b> <b>home</b> <b>is</b> another ambush; Li attacks, followed {{by a group of}} Triad hitmen. Li gets {{caught in the middle of}} the crossfire between Ah Jong and the Triad. Ah Jong and Li flee, and while Ah Jong's wounds are mended, they find themselves bonding and becoming friends. Ah Jong tells Li that should anything happen to him, Li should have Ah Jong's eyes donated for Jennie's surgery or use Ah Jong's money to fly her overseas to have her surgery performed by more experienced doctors.|$|E
5|$|The Avery Homestead is {{a two-story}} Colonial-style home in Ledyard, Connecticut {{that was built}} circa 1696. Evidence {{suggests}} that the house may have begun as a single-story, one-room house and later expanded to a two-story, two-room house by 1726. The house underwent major additions and renovations by Theophilus Avery and later his grandson, Theophilus Avery. In the mid-1950s, Amos Avery began a decade-long restoration effort to return the house to its 18th-century appearance. The Avery Homestead is historically significant as a well-preserved example of an 18th-century farmhouse with fine craftsmanship. <b>The</b> <b>home</b> <b>is</b> also historically important because more than twelve generations of the Avery family have resided there {{over the course of}} three centuries. The Avery Homestead was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.|$|E
50|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> {{built in}} <b>the</b> 1930s-1940's. By the 2000s some of <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>were</b> {{demolished}} and built into new ones; {{and they still}} are today.|$|R
50|$|The Archibald Smith Plantation <b>Home</b> <b>is</b> a {{historic}} house in Roswell, Georgia built in 1845. <b>The</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> built {{by one of}} Roswell's founders, Archibald Smith, and housed three generations of his family. <b>The</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> restored by <b>the</b> third generation, Arthur and Mary Smith, in 1940. <b>The</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> sold to <b>the</b> City of Roswell in 1986 and {{opened to the public}} as a house museum in 1992.|$|R
5000|$|The two story Craftsman {{structure}} was originally built in 1908 as single family <b>home.</b> During <b>the</b> Pacific Northwest logging {{boom of the}} early 20th century, <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> converted into a bordello which contained a doctor's clinic, whose operating room <b>was</b> located in <b>the</b> <b>home's</b> current dining area. By 1930 <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> converted into a nine room hospital, each room containing a pot bellied stove. In <b>the</b> 1960s, <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> again purchased {{and turned into a}} single family residence. Eventually <b>the</b> <b>home</b> fell into disrepair. During the early 1990s the ground floor was boarded up and <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> used as storage for an antique store in Kalama. In 2006, <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> purchased by Eric and Julianna Montgomery, who then restored the derelict property and in 2008 re-opened the structure as Montgomery House Bed and Breakfast., ...|$|R
5|$|The Great Hall is {{furnished}} with mostly 17th century oak furniture, including tables, coffers and wainscot chairs, {{and a great}} dining table, on which stand two blue and white late 17th century Delftware pyramidal tulip vases. One treasure of <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>is</b> the Lytes Herbal, a 16th-century botanical volume by noted horticulturist Henry Lyte, who was born and resided at the manor. Lyte's Niewe Herball was published in 1578 and was a translation and elaboration of the Cruydeboeck of Flemish herbalist Rembert Dodoens. The herbal was dedicated to Queen Elizabeth. A copy is displayed in the Great Hall.|$|E
5|$|The two-story Joseph F. Glidden House is {{constructed}} from locally fired brick, which is relatively soft. The softness of the brick has {{caused it to}} weather in a non-uniform fashion. The brick {{is said to have}} been fired at a small brickyard which once existed on the Kishwaukee River in DeKalb, near the present-day Lincoln Highway bridge. The home stands on a stone foundation and was designed by local carpenter and eventual barbed wire competitor to Glidden, Jacob Haish. Construction was completed in 1861 and <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>is</b> a prominent example of Illinois French Colonial architecture.|$|E
25|$|Finally, an {{emerging}} concept for <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>is</b> {{that of a}} wall mounted aquarium, {{some of which are}} displayed at the Living Art Marine Center.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> {{made in a}} {{warehouse}} on the intersection of Radio Road and Playhouse Drive, {{near the site of}} the Tuckerton Wireless tower. Buyers ordered the design by catalog, and <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> delivered a week later. <b>The</b> model <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> located on Radio Road, across from the present-day [...] "Shoppes of Mystic Isle" [...] shopping center.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>homes</b> <b>are</b> {{designed}} and built {{with the aim of}} reducing net energy use to near zero. <b>The</b> <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> built by Effect Home Builders, and one of them won <b>the</b> 2012 Canadian <b>Home</b> Builders' Association National Green Home Award.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} for <b>the</b> daughter of Herbert Fisk Johnson, Jr., Karen, {{and her first}} husband Willard Keland. <b>The</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> transferred upon their divorce to Karen Johnson, later Karen Johnson Boyd, who lived there until her death in 2016.|$|R

25|$|Supplemental natural {{disaster}} insurance covers specified expenses after a {{natural disaster}} renders the policyholder's home uninhabitable. Periodic payments are made directly to the insured until <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>is</b> rebuilt or a specified time period has elapsed.|$|E
25|$|The Miller House and Garden was {{constructed}} in 1957 and was designed by Eero Saarinen and landscaped by Dan Kiley. One of the few residential designs by Saarinen, <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>is</b> an expression of International Style and was built for J.

25|$|Once {{construction}} on <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>is</b> finished and the sweat equity is completed in full, the homeowner purchases the {{home with a}} 0% to 2% interest mortgage (in the United States). With monthly payments (including taxes and insurance) that do not exceed 30% of the household's monthly income.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> in part {{financed by}} the patients' fees. By 1941 <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>was</b> {{operated}} by <b>the</b> Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul {{for the treatment of}} mental and nervous disorders as well as selected cases of alcoholism and drug addiction. <b>The</b> <b>home</b> remained in existence until the 1980s.|$|R
5000|$|Carleton Heights <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> {{developed}} after World War II. Most of <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> {{not built}} until 1950.

Most of <b>the</b> 'vet' <b>homes</b> <b>are</b> still there ...|$|R
40|$|One thousand, {{nine hundred}} and seventy-seven {{pharmaceutical}} products used in <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>were</b> examined for microbial contamination. Viable micro-organisms were recovered from 14. 0 % of samples. Medicines used in <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>are</b> apparently {{not exposed to}} the same opportunities for contamination as those used in hospital...|$|R
25|$|The {{structural}} {{arrangement of}} <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>is</b> also redefined by Gilman. She removes the kitchen {{from the home}} leaving rooms to be arranged and extended in any form and freeing women from the provision of meals in the home. The home would become a true personal expression of the individual living in it.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Home</b> <b>is</b> {{a three-story}} {{building}} nine bays wide on its western (front) facade, where the basement is also exposed. It is faced in brick laid in running bond with granite trim, over masonry walls on a balloon frame. The sheet metal roof {{has a wide}} cornice with large, vertically elongated brackets at the corners and smaller ones in between.|$|E
25|$|That same year, Douglass {{bought the}} house {{which was to be}} the family's final home in Washington D.C., on a hill above the Anacostia River.
