50|$|Sweet cream <b>unsalted</b> <b>butter</b> is {{traditionally}} the fat {{of choice for}} buttercreams, {{as evidenced by the}} name. Butter provides a more delicate texture and superior flavor and mouthfeel (texture) when compared to vegetable shortening. Butter melts at a lower temperature, though, making it more difficult to use. The coloring provided by the butter is slightly off-white in the final frosting.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of added lyophilized butter serum on the heat stability of milk was investigated. The addition of lyophilized serum from salted butter to unconcentrated skimmed milk (SM) reduced the heat coagulation time (HCT) at, {{and increased the}} pH of, the maximum in the pH-HCT profile and caused disappearance of the minimum. NaCl had similar effects on the heat stability of SM as lyophilized salted butter serum, whereas lyophilized serum from <b>unsalted</b> <b>butter</b> had little effect. The addition of lyophilized salted butter serum to concentrated skimmed milk (CSM) also shifted the pH of maximum heat stability to a higher value and, at certain concentrations, increased the maximum HCT; similar effects were obtained on addition of NaCl, but lyophilized serum from <b>unsalted</b> <b>butter</b> had little effect. These {{results suggest that the}} effects of lyophilized serum from salted butter on the heat stability of SM or CSM are due primarily to the presence of a high level of NaCl in this serum...|$|R

40|$|In <b>unsalted</b> <b>butter</b> {{made from}} sweet cream with butter culture there was {{commonly}} a striking production of acetylmethylcarbinol plus diacetyl when the butter {{was held at}} a temperature permitting activity of the butter culture organisms. Under these conditions also the pH of the butter markedly decreased. The production of the carbinol plus diacetyl varied widely with different lots of butter held under the same conditions. The largest production occurred at the higher holding temperatures and in samples which developed the lowest pH values. Occasionally {{the amount of the}} carbinol plus diacetyl decreased during {{the first few days of}} holding; this decrease was sometimes followed by an increase. A striking production of the carbinol plus diacetyl was sometimes followed by a decrease. In salted butter no conspicuous production of acetylmethylcarbinol plus diacetyl occurred even when but little salt was added, and significant changes in the pH did not take place. The production of acetylmethylcarbinol plus diacetyl in <b>unsalted</b> <b>butter</b> was usually greater with a large addition of butter culture to the cream than with a small addition, and, in some cases, it was conspicuously increased by adding citric acid-fermenting streptococci along with the usual butter culture...|$|R

50|$|To {{make the}} {{original}} Don the Beachcomber Navy Grog, {{place in a}} cocktail shaker 3/4 ounce each fresh lime juice, white grapefruit juice, and club soda; 1 ounce each gold Demerara rum, dark Jamaican rum, and white Cuban or Puerto Rican rum; and 1 ounce honey mix (2:1 honey and water). Shake with ice, then strain into a glass with crushed ice (or ice formed into a cone around a straw). There are several variant recipes, however, {{and most of these}} use fresh lime juice and grapefruit juice along with the rums. Some, though, also add passionfruit juice, while others use guava juice or club soda water instead. Some recipes specify a sweetening agent of honey mixed with <b>unsalted</b> <b>butter,</b> while others use honey mixed with water. Unlike other famous tiki cocktails such as the Zombie or Mai Tai, Navy Grog uses no exotically flavored syrups such as orgeat or falernum.|$|R

40|$|Various defects {{of butter}} {{are due to}} growth of {{bacteria}} in the product. A number of the species involved belong to the genus Pseudomonas, and this genus includes certain species, such as Pseudomonas putrefaciens and Pseudomonas fragi, that are very objectionable {{from the standpoint of}} butter deterioration. Pseudomonas organisms and related types commonly are found in moist soil and in water, which suggests that contaminated water used in butter plants may be a source of the organisms in butter. The general characters of the Pseudomollas organisms indicate that they are important in butter deterioration. A number of them actively attack protein, fat or both. Growth temperatures are relatively low and include the range in which butter often is held; various species are so typically psychrophilic that they do not grow at 37 ° C. and may even be killed by continued exposure. While the organisms generally are sensitive to salt, the protective action of salt has been reduced or eliminated by the demand for lightly salted and <b>unsalted</b> <b>butter...</b>|$|R
50|$|Butter is {{essentially}} the fat of milk. It is usually made from sweet cream. In the USA, Ireland, the UK and the Nordic countries, salt is usually added to it. <b>Unsalted</b> (sweet) <b>butters</b> are most commonly used {{in the rest of}} Europe. However, it can also be made from acidulated or bacteriologically soured cream. Well into the 19th century butter was still made from cream that had been allowed to stand and sour naturally. The cream was then skimmed {{from the top of the}} milk and poured into a wooden tub.|$|R

5000|$|The butter carving booth {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{exhibits}} at the state fair. Half of the princess's hometown and all of her family and friends stand around the rotating cooler waiting for Christensen to turn the blank stare on that 90-pound block of butter into the mirror image of their Princess Kay finalist. While she carves their faces, the princesses hold a microphone and answers question from the public about life on a dairy farm. In between interviews, Christensen talks to the princesses about boys, her children and her grandchildren. [...] She likes working with butter as a medium because it's forgiving and can be [...] "squished" [...] into any form. It's also an attractive, eye-catching surface. She said the salted butter is much nicer to carve than the <b>unsalted</b> <b>butter.</b> Freezing the butter before carving leaves the image looking flaky. [...] She uses a number of tools to mold and shape the butter, such as a long sharp floss-like cord, a number of knives and a 5-gallon pail to put the scraps in for the princesses to take home. She said in one of her interviews with The Wall Street Journal that this job was too big for a butter knife. She uses a similar style to Michelangelo who chipped away at his images. [...] She plans to continue the butter sculpting at the Minnesota State Fair until she is no longer able to use her fingers. Christensen’s legacy helped lead to the creation of the Butter-fy Yourself Facebook App in 2010.

60|$|The eavesdropper faltered {{near their}} kind backs, wishing for {{something}} more from them which should give their souls away, but they remained silently standing there, {{and he did not}} somehow feel authorized to make them reflect that, if the car was lighted up, it must be open, and that the friendly porter somewhere within would not mind letting them look through it under his eye. Perhaps they did reflect, and the woman was trying to embolden the man to the hardy venture. In the end they did not attempt it, but they turned away with another sigh from the woman which found its echo in the eavesdropper's heart. Doubtless if they had penetrated that splendid interior without having paid for seats, it would, in some fine, mystical sort, have pauperized them; it would have corrupted them; they would have wished after that always to travel in such cars, when clearly they could not afford it; very possibly it might have led to their moral if not financial ruin. So he tried to still his bosom's ache, but he could never quite forget that gentle pair with their unrequited longing, and the other day they came almost the first thing into his mind when he read that a great German steamship company had some thoughts of putting on a train of Pullman cars from the port of arrival to the mercantile metropolis which was the real end of their ships' voyages. He thought, whimsically, perversely, how little difference it would make to that pair, how little to those measureless most whose journeys shall end in heaven, where Pullman passengers, or even passengers by the ordinary European first-class cars, may be only too glad to meet them. He gave a looser rein to his thoughts and considered how very little the ordinary necessities of life, such as Pullman cars and taxicabs and electric radiators and non-storage chickens and <b>unsalted</b> <b>butter</b> concern the great mass of the saints, who would find them the rarest luxuries, and could hardly be imagined coveting them; and then from this wild revery he fell to asking himself whether a Pullman train would be such a great advance or advantage over the old-fashioned European first-class carriages in which he had been so long content to travel with the native nobility. Self-brought to book on this point, he had to own that he had once had moments of thinking in a German second-class car that he would not change to an American Pullman if he could for even less than a third more money. He recalled a pleasant run from Crewe to Edinburgh in a third-class English car, when he never once thought of a Pullman car except to think it was no better. To be sure, this was after two-thirds of his third-class fellow-passengers had got out, and he was left to the sole enjoyment of two-thirds of the seats. It is the luxury of space which your more money buys you in England, where no one much lower than a duke or a prime minister now goes first class for a long haul. For short hauls it is different, and on the Continent it is altogether different. There you are often uncomfortably crowded in the first-class carriages, and doubtless would be in a Pullman if there were any, so that if you are wise, or only well informed, you will give the guard a shilling to telegraph before leaving London and get you a number on the Rapide from Calais to Paris.|$|R
40|$|Bis (2 -ethylhexyl) {{phthalate}} (DEHP) is {{a commonly}} used plasticizer and {{is thought to}} have potential for disrupting human endocrine function and inducing tumorigenesis. DEHP {{has been shown to be}} ubiquitous in food, especially fatty foods, such as milk, cheese, and butter. Consequently, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), have keen interests in determining whether or not the presence of this phthalate in food is the result of contamination with synthetic DEHP, made from petroleum derived feed stocks, or is in-fact, the result of natural processes. Herein, the fraction of contemporary carbon (i. e., naturally produced) in DEHP was determined for each of seven 1. 1 kg samples of <b>unsalted</b> market <b>butter</b> by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, after isolation and purification methods optimized to provide ~ 250 μg of the DEHP in butter containing ~ 0. 7 mg/kg DEHP at a total carbon purity of 92. 5 ± 1. 2 % to 97. 3 ± 1. 0 % (n= 3, 1 σ as determined by gas chromatography-electron impact-mass spectrometry (GC- EIMS). Method blanks contributed 0. 52 ± 0. 19 μg to 1. 08 ± 0. 08 μg (n= 3, 1 σ) carbon as DEHP in individual butter isolates, and median exogenous carbon contamination, including (1) contributions from post-HPLC handling (1. 8 ± 9. 1 μg to 22. 2 ± 9. 7 μg), (2) method derived carbonates (31. 2 ± 7. 2 μg), and (3) matrix-inherent carbonates (median of 120 μg carbon), was 50 %.
