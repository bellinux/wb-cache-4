50|$|A green band {{around the}} middle {{originally}} indicated an Amatol filling (1915-1920s), while it later indicated a Baratol or <b>Trotyl</b> filling (1920s-1970s).|$|E
50|$|The primary {{ammunition}} was HE (high explosive) shells {{filled with}} Amatol, <b>Trotyl</b> (TNT) or Lyddite. The standard shell weight was 290 lb. However, there were 19 variants of HE shell, some with sub-variants. Later marks of shell had a fill that varied between about 25 and 40 lb of HE, and shell bodies varying in length between 28 and 32 in. There was also some use of Common Pointed shell filled with Shellite. Later fuzes included various versions of No 101, 106 and 188. More than three million {{rounds of ammunition}} were expended during the war.|$|E
50|$|Priddy's Hard itself then {{focussed}} on {{the filling}} of shells and cartridges, {{rather than on}} bulk storage. During World War I the sudden increase in demand led to additional filling rooms for cartridges, tubes and artillery fuzes saw added in rows around the cordite magazines (west of the old site); there were also new storage buildings added in this area for mines, bombs and depth charges. New explosives such as <b>trotyl</b> (TNT) and amatol were provided with storage and processing rooms near the shell-filling rooms. A mainline rail connection was first provided in 1914 and three years later a long 'transfer shed' was built alongside the New Shell Store to enable the direct loading of filled shells and other items on to rolling stock.|$|E
50|$|Model 53-27 with 265 kg of TNT was {{developed}} domestically {{in the so-called}} , and it has poor 3.7 km range (45 kts). In 1932 USSR bought in Italy several types of torpedoes, and the 21-inch model of Whitehead plant in Fiume (in the Soviet Union it was designated 53F) was considered superior. After adapting several features from the latter in unsuccessful 53-36 {{the decision was made}} to copy 53F. Resulting 53-38 (3 speed regimes, range up to 10 km, 300 kg of <b>trotyl</b> in warhead) was later upgraded to 53-38U (400 kg of TNT, roughly the same characteristics) and then redesigned in 53-39 (317 kg, up to 51 kt), considered to be one of the fastest in the world at the time (another were secret Japanese oxygen torpedoes and the Italian Silure Tipo W. 270/533,4 × 7,20 Veloce).|$|E
5000|$|On 13 January 1940, Aura II was escorting {{a convoy}} across the Sea of Åland. The small convoy {{consisted}} of the cargo vessels SS Anneberg, SS Hebe and the passenger vessel SS Bore I. When they passed Märket Island, the escort vessel Tursas noticed torpedo tracks in the water. Soon thereafter a submarine surfaced 300 m on the port side. Tursas sounded the alarm and tried to ram the Soviet submarine. Aura II followed and dropped three depth charges, and soon an oil slick was seen on the water surface. It was the Soviet submarine ShCh-324, which {{had been trying to}} sink the largest of the transport vessels Anneberg. However, the torpedo went between Anneberg and Hebe. Seeing the oil slick, Aura II decided to finish off the submarine. Two more depth charges were fired, but a third depth charge exploded in its thrower. The 135 kg <b>trotyl</b> charge completely tearing the wooden ship apart. 26 men died and 15 were saved. The ship's commander, Lieutenant Esra Terä, was mortally wounded, but managed to utter some last words: [...] "Let us sing, boys". The Soviet submarine managed to return to its home base.|$|E
40|$|Oxidation of 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) by aqueous {{nitric acid}} at high {{temperature}} and pressure gives 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzoic acid (TNBA) and other valuable products, such as 1, 3, 5 -trinitrobenzene (TNB). Optimization of the kinetics {{proved to be}} critical for the selective oxidation of the methyl group. High yield of a desired product can be obtained only under a narrow range of conditions. Thus, the best yield (70 to 75 %) of TNBA was achieved at a 35 to 45 % conversion of TNT (80 % nitric acid, 194 C, 20 min), whereas the decarboxylation product (TNB) was the major component of the reaction mixture after a 50 -min reaction. Subsequent separation of TNBA was achieved by selective extraction with aqueous bicarbonate. Practical technology development steps for a continuous mode of operation leading to the chief products are also discussed. This technology can use commercial raw <b>trotyl</b> and <b>trotyl</b> from discharged ammunition as the starting material. The latter could be of particular importance for the conversion program aimed at the utilization of ammunition supplies...|$|E
40|$|The {{catalytic}} decomposition of dinitrotoluene (DNT; 3 - 4 -DNT), {{a by-product of}} the explosive trinitrotoluene (<b>trotyl),</b> on a platinum surface is investigated computationally. Reaction paths have been computed for a DNT molecule interacting with a Pt-cluster under varying temperatures using quantum-chemical density functional theory. Two possible initiation steps where DNT split either into nitro-tolyl and NO 2, or in nitro-tolyl-oxidanyl and NO, are considered. The energy barrier for the catalytic process is found to decrease significantly for the Pt catalyzed reaction compared with the uncatalyzed reaction. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|Semipalatinsk/ESR dosimetry/Low dose exposure/Biological dosimetry/Nuclear {{explosion}} test. Between 1949 and 1989 the Semipalatinsk {{nuclear test}} site (SNTS), {{an area of}} 19, 000 square km in northeastern Kazakhstan, was the location of over 400 nuclear test explosions with a total explosive energy of 6. 6 Mt TNT (trinitrotoluene or <b>trotyl)</b> equivalent. It is estimated {{that the bulk of}} the radiation exposure to the population resulted from three tests, conducted in 1949, 1951, and 1953 although estima-tions of radiation doses received by the local population have varied significantly. Analysis of the pub-lished ESR dose reconstruction results for residents of the villages near the SNTS show that they do not correlate well with other methods of dose assessment (e. g. model dose calculation and thermo lumines-cence dosimetry (TLD) in bricks). The most significant difference in dose estimations was found for the population of Dolon, which was exposed as result of the first Soviet nuclear test in 1949. Published results of ESR measurements in tooth enamel are considerably lower than other dose estimations. Detailed anal-ysis of these results is provided and a possible explanation for this discrepancy and ways to eliminate it are suggested...|$|E
40|$|Urine {{samples taken}} after work {{and after a}} free weekend from 50 workers {{employed}} in various activities in a chemical plant manufacturing explosives were analysed. On the basis of hygienic surveys, the subjects were divided into three categories of exposure to trinitrotoluene (TNT). The urine analyses consisted of gas chromatographic identification of TNT and its two metabolites, 4 -ADNT and 2 -ADNT, and a determination of the mutagenic activity. Two frame shift detector strains of Salmonella typhimurium were used, TA 98 and TA 98 NR, the latter being deficient in endogenous nitroreductase activity. On the basis of previous results on TNT mutagenicity, no exogeneous metabolic system {{was used to test}} the urine concentrates. Both tester strains showed that the mean urinary mutagenic activity was higher in the after work samples than in post weekend samples from the same subjects, showing that bacterial nitroreductase activity was not significantly responsible for the mutagenicity, although the response was higher with strain TA 98 than with TA 98 NR. The interindividual variation in urine mutagenicity was high, however, and {{the difference between the two}} sampling times was statistically significant (p less than 0. 05) only for the high exposed group (workers in <b>trotyl</b> foundry and sieve house). Correlation between urinary mutagenicity and concentration of TNT in urine was poor; correlation was significant only with the urinary concentration of 4 -ADNT. The correlation between urinary TNT and both metabolites was good (p less than 0. 001). These results suggest that analysis of 4 -ADNT in urine would be a sufficient biological measure for controlling exposure to TNT...|$|E
