5|$|Each Clan has an {{identical}} hierarchical system. From birth, newborn kittens {{are known as}} ‘kits’, {{as evidenced by the}} ‘-kit’ suffix {{at the end of their}} name. Parents of the kits choose the names; often, a name is related to their appearance (‘Graykit’), an element of nature (‘Sandkit’), or in regards to how the parent felt when the kit was born (‘Brokenkit’). Mothers, known as ‘queens’, <b>then</b> <b>look</b> after their kits for their first six months of life. Kits are expected to stay in camp at all times, and sleep in a designated and comfortable area known as the ‘nursery’.|$|E
5|$|When {{trying to}} explain past phenomena, paleontologists and other {{historical}} scientists often construct a set of hypotheses about the causes and <b>then</b> <b>look</b> for a smoking gun, a {{piece of evidence that}} indicates that one hypothesis is a better explanation than others. Sometimes the smoking gun is discovered by a fortunate accident during other research. For example, the discovery by Luis Alvarez and Walter Alvarez of an iridium-rich layer at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary made asteroid impact and volcanism the most favored explanations for the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{conceptual}} clarity of this Feynman approach to QED, almost no early textbooks follow {{him in their}} presentation. When performing calculations {{it is much easier}} to work with the Fourier transforms of the propagators. Experimental tests of quantum electrodynamics are typically scattering experiments. In scattering theory, particles' momenta rather than their positions are considered, and it is convenient to think of particles as being created or annihilated when they interact. Feynman diagrams <b>then</b> <b>look</b> the same, but the lines have different interpretations. The electron line represents an electron with a given energy and momentum, with a similar interpretation of the photon line. A vertex diagram represents the annihilation of one electron and the creation of another together with the absorption or creation of a photon, each having specified energies and momenta.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} group of mob members {{plotting}} a scheme whilst Hauer is seen drinking an unspecified alcohol. Subsequently, the song starts and Minogue is seen on a diving board, jumping into a pool, presumably dead. Mob members look towards her body in distance, but <b>then</b> <b>look</b> away towards Hauer. She starts singing the track in the pool, gets out of it, and walks towards the mob members who seem disinterested of her presence. The singer undresses herself and throws the dress out of the window, which captures their attention. She subsequently drives in a limousine and puts on accessories whilst the driver takes her to a casino. The artist enters a large room, and plays poker with several members, eventually winning. Minogue appears in the limousine again, sporting the blue cocktail dress. Hauer, who is by himself at home, hears Minogue walking into the apartment, but she pushes over a large green vase and smashes it; disinterested, he looks towards in distance. The final scene has Minogue undressing herself and walking down steps.|$|E
5|$|Ward helps Quatermass and Fowler gain {{entry to}} the plant and they find that Dillon has been {{discharged}} from the infirmary and has left. They <b>then</b> <b>look</b> around and discover that gases are pumped to the giant pressure domes from the pilot plant: ammonia, hydrogen, nitrogen and methane, as opposed to oxygen as in Quatermass' moonbase pressure dome idea. Meanwhile, the guards intimidate and then murder a family who were having a picnic nearby. Back at the plant, Ward slips away to look inside a dome, and Quatermass and Fowler find him stumbling out of it dying and covered in black slime, which before his death Ward reveals was inside the dome instead of food. Fowler and Quatermass escape back to the Rocket Group and analyse Ward's tie with Leo and Paula, finding that the slime is a corrosive, poisonous substance, fatal to all forms of life on Earth. Meanwhile, the asteroid is approaching its near point.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} an {{observational}} study is one that explores the association between smoking and lung cancer. This type of study typically uses a survey to collect observations about the area of interest and then performs statistical analysis. In this case, the researchers would collect observations of both smokers and non-smokers, perhaps through a cohort study, and <b>then</b> <b>look</b> {{for the number of}} cases of lung cancer in each group. A case-control study is another type of observational study in which people with and without the outcome of interest (e.g. lung cancer) are invited to participate and their exposure histories are collected.|$|E

25|$|I don't hate Islam. I {{consider}} it a backward culture. I have travelled much in the world. And wherever Islam rules, it's just terrible. All the hypocrisy. It's a bit like those old Reformed Protestants. The Reformed lie all the time. And why is that? Because they have standards and values that are so high that you can't humanly maintain them. You also see that in that Muslim culture. <b>Then</b> <b>look</b> at the Netherlands. In what country could an electoral leader of such a large movement as mine be openly homosexual? How wonderful that that's possible. That's something that one can be proud of. And I'd like {{to keep it that}} way, thank you very much.|$|E
25|$|Frescography is {{a method}} for reproduction/creation of murals using digital {{printing}} methods, invented in 1998 by Rainer Maria Latzke, and patented in 2000. The frescography is based on digitally cut-out motifs which are stored in a database. CAM software programs then allow to enter the measurements of a wall or ceiling to create a mural design with low resolution motifs. Since architectural elements such as beams, windows or doors can be integrated, the design will result in an accurately and tailor-fit wall mural. Once a design is finished, the low resolution motifs are converted into the original high resolution images and are printed on canvas by Wide-format printers. The canvas then {{can be applied to}} the wall in a wall-paperhanging like procedure and will <b>then</b> <b>look</b> like on-site created mural.|$|E
25|$|Contact lenses are {{typically}} {{inserted into the}} eye by placing them on the pad of the index or middle finger with the concave side upward and then using that finger to place the lens on the eye. Rigid lenses should be placed directly on the cornea. Soft lenses may {{be placed on the}} sclera (white of the eye) and then slid into place. Another finger of the same hand, or a finger of the other hand, is used to keep the eye wide open. Alternatively, the user may close their eyes and <b>then</b> <b>look</b> towards their nose, sliding the lens into place over the cornea. Problems may arise if the lens folds, turns inside-out, slides off the finger prematurely, or adheres more tightly to the finger than the eye surface. A drop of solution may help the lens adhere to the eye.|$|E

25|$|A further {{characteristic}} {{of the role of}} the facilitator in the social constructivist viewpoint, is that the instructor and the learners are equally involved in learning from each other as well (Holt and Willard-Holt 2000). This means that the learning experience is both subjective and objective and requires that the instructor's culture, values and background become an essential part of the interplay between learners and tasks in the shaping of meaning. Learners compare their version of the truth with that of the instructor and fellow learners to get to a new, socially tested version of truth (Kukla 2000). The task or problem is thus the interface between the instructor and the learner (McMahon 1997). This creates a dynamic interaction between task, instructor and learner. This entails that learners and instructors should develop an awareness of each other's viewpoints and <b>then</b> <b>look</b> to their own beliefs, standards and values, thus being both subjective and objective at the same time (Savery 1994).|$|E
500|$|The {{other main}} type {{of science is}} {{experimental}} science, which is often said to work by conducting experiments to disprove hypotheses about the workings and causes of natural phenomena– note that this approach cannot confirm a hypothesis is correct, since some later experiment may disprove it. However, when confronted with totally unexpected phenomena, such as the first evidence for invisible radiation, experimental scientists often use the same approach as historical scientists: construct a set of hypotheses about the causes and <b>then</b> <b>look</b> for a [...] "smoking gun".|$|E
500|$|Based on the premiere, Merrill Barr of Forbes {{felt that}} the show [...] "has grown up a lot since its first year, and with the start of season three, it's hard to imagine what {{complaints}} any fans could possibly still have. If you want overall continuity, you got it. If you want people with super powers going crazy, it's there. If you want an ensemble cast that brings the broadcast television corner of the MCU to life, <b>then</b> <b>look</b> no further. The point is, with the new season of S.H.I.E.L.D., it's everything one could ask from the show." [...] Vulture's Scott Meslow stated that the premiere was [...] "riddled with [...] visual signifiers, highlighting the ways Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. has gradually become sharper, sleeker, and more reliant on the bones of its comic-book source material." ...|$|E

500|$|Peng's {{forces were}} the most poorly armed of the newly reorganized army, but were {{responsible}} for the area around the communist capital, Yan'an. In March 1947, the Kuomintang general, Hu Zongnan, invaded this area with 260,000 soldiers. Hu's forces were among the best-trained and most well-supplied Nationalist units, but one of Zhou Enlai's spies was able to provide Peng with information about Hu's strategic plans, his forces' troop distributions, strength, and positions, and details about the air cover available to Hu. Peng was forced to abandon Yan'an in late March, but resisted Hu's forces long enough for Mao and other senior Party leaders to evacuate safely. Mao wanted Peng to provoke a decisive confrontation with Hu immediately, but Peng dissuaded him, and by April Mao agreed that Peng's objective was to [...] "keep the enemy on the run... tire him out completely, reduce his food supplies, and <b>then</b> <b>look</b> for an opportunity to destroy him".|$|E
500|$|The {{fountain}} uses [...] per hour, 97% {{of which}} is recycled back into the system. [...] Getting the water to the spout took ingenuity. Although consideration was given to omitting a LED tile, {{it was determined that}} the images would <b>then</b> <b>look</b> as though they were each missing a tooth. Instead, one tile in each tower is recessed about [...] to allow the installation of [...] clear tubing for the water nozzle. The water regularly spills over the fountain and down the sides of the towers and intermittently spouts from the nozzle. Two essential custom fittings contribute to the artistic vision of the fountain: a custom glass block at the upper edge for guiding the water's descent while remaining unobtrusive, and a plastic nozzle fitted to the stainless steel frame to control the rate of water flow and reduce liability to the city for any injuries sustained by the fountain's interactive participants. The interactive participants are usually children playing in the stream from the water spout or under the cascade. The risk that the spouting water would knock people down made the design both a legal and a physical challenge.|$|E
500|$|While {{investigating}} the VIN from an axle {{of the truck}} used in the explosion and {{the remnants of the}} license plate, federal agents were able to link the truck to a specific Ryder rental agency in Junction City, Kansas. Using a sketch created with the assistance of Eldon Elliot, owner of the agency, the agents were able to implicate McVeigh in the bombing. McVeigh was also identified by Lea McGown of the Dreamland Motel, who remembered him parking a large yellow Ryder truck in the lot; McVeigh had signed in under his real name at the motel, using an address that matched the one on his forged license and the charge sheet at the Perry Police Station. Before signing his real name at the motel, McVeigh had used false names for his transactions. However, McGown noted, [...] "People are so used to signing their own name that when they go to sign a phony name, they almost always go to write, and <b>then</b> <b>look</b> up for a moment as if to remember the new name they want to use. That's what [...] did, and when he looked up I started talking to him, and it threw him." ...|$|E

500|$|Shepard was {{designated}} Chief of the Astronaut Office in November 1963. He thereby became responsible for NASA [...] astronaut training. This involved {{the development of}} appropriate training programs for all astronauts and the scheduling of training of individual astronauts for specific missions and roles. He provided and coordinated astronaut input into mission planning and the design of spacecraft and other equipment {{to be used by}} astronauts on space missions. He also was on the selection panel for the NASA Astronaut Group 5 in 1966. He spent much of his time investing in banks, wildcatting, and real estate. He became part owner and vice president of Baytown National Bank and would spend hours on the phone in his NASA office overseeing it. He also bought a partnership in a ranch in Weatherford, Texas, that raised horses and cattle. During this period, his secretary had several head shot photographs taken of Shepard, posed with various expressions on his face. She would post these on the door to his private office, with a sign which said [...] "Mood of the Day". Visitors could <b>then</b> <b>look</b> at the photo to decide whether it was a good time to talk to him. Tom Wolfe characterised Shepard's dual personalities as [...] "Smilin' Al" [...] and the [...] "Icy Commander". [...] "Inside his locker", Wolfe wrote, [...] "he kept Smilin' Al of the Cape!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{group is}} first pictured sitting around {{backstage}} while waiting {{to have their}} hair and make-up done. In another scene, Little Mix are filmed on their tour bus. This scene features Jade Thirlwall scribbling in a notebook as the other group members play around, laugh and take pictures of each other sleeping using the Samsung Galaxy. The group <b>then</b> <b>look</b> at the pictures they took together. In a different scene, Perrie Edwards is seen cuddling a puppy. Little Mix are also pictured singing [...] "Change Your Life" [...] {{to each other in}} a studio and preparing to go on stage at their Rhyl Pavilion tour date. Other scenes features the group in a dance rehearsal, using funny facial expressions and bonding with their mothers backstage. During the dance rehearsal, the group is seen practising dance moves to their DNA Tour setlist with their tour choreographer and backing dancers. In other scenes, the group is seen playing with their own Little Mix dolls and Thirlwall, sporting blue hair, is wheeled away in a cardboard box. Before going onstage, Leigh-Anne Pinnock is seen smiling as a make-up artist applies her final touches while Thirlwall is pictured applying her own make-up. The group then centre themselves as they show each other support by hugging one another before heading to the stage. After the show, the foursome is seen showing their solidarity by embracing one another again.|$|E
500|$|Skyrim {{is powered}} by Bethesda's Creation Engine, created {{specifically}} for Skyrim. After Fallout 3s release, the team devised numerous design objectives to meet for Skyrim, and according to Howard, the team [...] "got all those done and kept going". Had the team {{not been able to}} meet their design goals with current hardware, they would have waited for the next generation and released Skyrim then, but Howard felt that the technology of the time did not hold the team back at all. The Creation Engine allows for numerous improvements in graphical fidelity over Bethesda's previous efforts. For example, the draw distance renders farther than in previous Elder Scrolls games; Howard provided an example where the player can stare at a small object such as a fork in detail, and <b>then</b> <b>look</b> up at a mountain and run to the top of it. Dynamic lighting allows shadows to be created by any structure or item in the game world, and the Creation Engine allowed for greater detail in flora production than SpeedTree had in previous Bethesda games. For example, with Bethesda's own technology, developers were able to give weight to the branches of trees, which affects how trees blow in the wind. In addition, the technology allows wind to affect the flow of water in channels such as rivers and streams. Because of the large presence of snow in Skyrims game world, the technological upgrades were applied to weather effects and allow for dynamic snow fall upon the terrain, instead of snow that was rendered as a textural effect in previous games.|$|E
