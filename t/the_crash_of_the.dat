5|$|On December 8, 1972, United Airlines Flight 553, a Boeing 737-200, {{crashed into}} a {{residential}} area outside Midway during landing. <b>The</b> <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 737-200 killed 43 of the 61 on board, and two on the ground. One of the victims on the plane was Dorothy Hunt, the wife of Watergate conspirator E. Howard Hunt. She was carrying $10,000 in cash. James McCord alleged that she supplied the Watergate defendants with money for legal expenses.|$|E
5|$|The {{search and}} rescue response, crash {{recovery}} operation, and investigation by the Government of Canada took over four years and cost CAD 57 million (at that time approximately US$38 million). The Transportation Safety Board of Canada's (TSB) report of their investigation stated that flammable material used in the aircraft's structure allowed a fire to spread {{beyond the control of}} the crew, resulting in a loss of control and <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Australian National Airways (ANA) never {{recovered}} from <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Amana. Since {{the beginning of}} 1945, 77 people {{had been killed in}} accidents in aircraft operated by ANA. In late 1948, ANA suffered 4 crashes in 4 months. The loss of ANA's reputation as a safe airline, together with the unblemished safety record and growing commercial success of its rival Trans Australia Airlines, sent ANA into decline. In 1957 ANA was taken over by Ansett Transport Industries Limited and merged with Ansett Airways to form the domestic airline Ansett-ANA.|$|E
60|$|By <b>the</b> <b>crashing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bushes the fugitives {{could hear}} strong parties {{making their way}} along the shore in either direction. An hour passed, during which the fugitives floated nearly {{opposite}} the clearing.|$|R
60|$|The knights and men-at-arms straggled {{slowly into}} the forest, some by the path, some elsewhere, grumbling audibly at the black work before them. At last <b>the</b> <b>crashing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{branches}} died away, and all was still.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> {{report and}} <b>the</b> <b>crashing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood made one noise, succeeded by an unearthly stillness, then <b>the</b> noise <b>of</b> a window hastily opened. Burleigh fled hastily down the stairs, and flinging wide the hall door, shouted loudly for assistance.|$|R
5|$|Nearly {{a century}} later, during <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mississippi Company and the South Sea Company in about 1720, tulip mania {{appeared}} in satires of these manias. When Johann Beckmann first described tulip mania in the 1780s, he {{compared it to}} the failing lotteries of the time. In Goldgar's view, even many modern popular works about financial markets, such as Burton Malkiel's A Random Walk Down Wall Street (1973) and John Kenneth Galbraith's A Short History of Financial Euphoria (1990; written soon after the crash of 1987), used the tulip mania as a lesson in morality. Tulip mania again became a popular reference during the dot-com bubble of 1995–2001.|$|E
5|$|The Flight Superintendent and the Technical Superintendent of ANA {{simulated}} some {{of these}} events during a test flight in another DC-4. They were satisfied that the time intervals between events were compatible with the likely sequence of events leading to <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Amana, {{and that it was}} a plausible explanation of the accident. However, on legal advice this possible explanation of the crash was not made public. Two accidents involving Douglas DC-4s, one approaching Dublin Airport, Ireland, in 1961 and another approaching Stockport Airport, Manchester, United Kingdom, in 1967 were attributed to interruption of fuel supply when engines were supplied from the cross-feed system which was open to an empty fuel tank, allowing air to be drawn into the cross-feed pipe.|$|E
5|$|The Minister for Civil Aviation, Thomas White, {{appointed}} Justice William Simpson of the ACT Supreme Court {{to conduct}} an Air Court of Inquiry into <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Amana. The Inquiry opened in Perth on 7 February 1951. Justice Simpson was assisted by two assessors – Captain J.W. Bennett, a pilot with British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines; and Mr D.B. Hudson, an aeronautical engineer with Qantas Empire Airways. The Commonwealth Crown Solicitor was represented by L.D. Seaton and B. Simpson. Australian National Airways was represented by George Pape. The Department of Civil Aviation was represented by Henry Winneke. The Air Pilots' Association was represented by Francis Burt. The Inquiry sat in Perth for 12 days; heard evidence from 67 witnesses and concluded on Tuesday 20 February.|$|E
60|$|They {{raised their}} voices, {{but the only}} answer was <b>the</b> <b>crashing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> waves and <b>the</b> cry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea-birds.

60|$|Dora and Nellie {{heard the}} loud talking after <b>the</b> <b>crashing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> launch into the {{houseboat}} and also heard {{part of what}} followed. Both wanted to cry out for assistance, but did not dare, fearing that something still worse might happen to them.|$|R

5|$|Corporal Dwayne Hicks (Michael Biehn), Sergeant Apone's second-in-command, {{takes over}} when Apone {{and most of}} the Colonial Marines are {{captured}} by the Aliens and commanding officer Lieutenant Gorman is incapacitated. Hicks looks for options for holding out with the survivors of the Hadley's Hope colony until aid arrives, and he and Ripley bond when he teaches her to use a pulse rifle. He is one of four survivors of the military mission. As the survivors escape, Hicks is injured when a spray of acid blood from an Alien hits his chest and face. He is apparently killed during <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sulaco in Alien 3, after which a body impaled on a broken support brace is found in his cryochamber. In the video game , Hicks is revealed to be alive and was actually kidnapped by mercenaries working for the Weyland-Yutani Corporation. His body is replaced by an anonymous victim to cover up the kidnapping, and he is rescued by Colonial Marines.|$|E
5|$|In August 1947, Chadwick {{was killed}} in <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Avro Tudor 2 {{prototype}} and was succeeded by Sir William Farren. Reductions in wing thickness {{made it impossible to}} incorporate the split bomb bays and stacked engines, thus the engines were placed side-by-side in pairs either side of a single bomb-bay, with the fuselage growing somewhat. The wingtip fins gave way to a single fin on the aircraft's centreline. Rival manufacturer Handley Page received a prototype contract for its crescent-winged HP.80 B.35/46 tender in November 1947. Though considered the best option, contract placement for Avro's design was delayed whilst its technical strength was established. Instructions to proceed with the construction of two Avro 698 prototypes was received in January 1948. As an insurance measure against both radical designs failing, Short Brothers received a contract for the prototype SA.4 to the less-stringent Specification B.14/46; the SA.4, later named Sperrin, was not required. In April 1948, Vickers also received authority to proceed with their Type 660 which, although falling short of the B.35/46 Specification, being of a more conventional design would be available sooner; this plane entered service as the Valiant.|$|E
5|$|Populations of the {{peregrine}} falcon have bounced back {{in most parts}} of the world. In Britain, there has been a recovery of populations since <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1960s. This has been greatly assisted by conservation and protection work led by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. The RSPB has estimated that there are 1,402 breeding pairs in the UK. Peregrines now breed in many mountainous and coastal areas, especially in the west and north, and nest in some urban areas, capitalising on the urban feral pigeon populations for food. In Southampton, a nest prevented restoration of mobile telephony services for several months, after Vodafone engineers despatched to repair a faulty transmitter mast discovered a nest in the mast, and were prevented by the Wildlife and Countryside Act, on pain of a possible prison sentence, from proceeding with repairs until the chicks fledged. In many parts of the world {{peregrine falcon}}s have adapted to urban habitats, nesting on cathedrals, skyscraper window ledges, tower blocks, and the towers of suspension bridges. Many of these nesting birds are encouraged, sometimes gathering media attention and often monitored by cameras.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> sentries, hearing <b>the</b> <b>crashing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roof poles, {{leaped to}} their feet and rushed into the hut. Jane Clayton tried to roll aside as the great form lit upon the floor so close to her that one foot pinned her {{clothing}} to the ground.|$|R

25|$|The Polikarpov I-1 was {{the first}} {{indigenous}} Soviet monoplane fighter.

25|$|Film of <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gee Bee Z {{has become}} {{some of the}} most well known footage from the era of air racing.

50|$|The {{foreshore}} is {{the area}} on land {{between high and low}} tide. Like the upper shoreface, it is constantly affected by wave action. Cross bedding and lamination are present and coarser sands are present because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high energy present by <b>the</b> <b>crashing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> waves. The sand is also very well sorted.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ponzi {{scheme and}} the {{publication}} of Sudipto Sen's letter led to a barrage of cross-party accusations.

TMC blamed CPM for letting Ponzi funds grow in Bengal.|$|E
25|$|The {{crew and}} {{passengers}} took refuge in the rigging, but {{one by one the}} masts broke and went over the side and the men were hurled into the breakers. There was little opportunity for her crew to save themselves. The ship had struck well off shore and only four men reached it - a passenger, two able seamen and an apprentice. None of the survivors remembered how they actually got ashore; they heard <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> masts, and then felt the wreckage bumping them about in the surf.|$|E
