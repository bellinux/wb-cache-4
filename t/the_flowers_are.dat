5|$|Inflorescence : Usually {{indeterminate}} (lacking terminal flower) as a raceme (Lilium); sometimes {{reduced to}} a single terminal flower (Tulipa). When pluriflor (multiple blooms), <b>the</b> <b>flowers</b> <b>are</b> arranged in a cluster or rarely are subumbellate (Gagea) or a thyrse (spike).|$|E
5|$|Inflorescences (clusters of flowers) of {{at least}} 60plant {{families}} are eaten by lemurs {{ranging in size from}} the tiny mouse lemurs to the relatively large ruffed lemurs. If <b>the</b> <b>flowers</b> <b>are</b> not exploited, sometimes the nectar is consumed (nectarivory) along with the pollen (palynivory). At least 24native species from 17plant families are targeted for nectar or pollen consumption.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>flowers</b> <b>are</b> {{arranged}} in umbelliform inflorescences which are pauciflor or pluriflor (2-14 flowers), supported on an erect hollow scape (flower stem) which is 2075cm (12"30") tall and 2.55cm (1"2") in diameter with two free bracts forming a spathe which is bivalve with free leaflets at its base.|$|E
50|$|According to folklore, <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> <b>is</b> Chervona Ruta. <b>The</b> <b>flower</b> <b>is</b> yellow, but {{according}} to legend, it turns red {{on the eve of}} Ivan Kupala Day.|$|R

50|$|The {{tubular base}} of <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> <b>is</b> {{encapsulated}} in a reddish ribbed calyx of sepals with tiny pointed lobes. <b>The</b> <b>flower</b> <b>is</b> roughly a centimeter long {{with a wide}} mouth divided into an upper and lower lip. <b>The</b> <b>flower</b> <b>is</b> pink, <b>the</b> upper lip usually a darker shade than the lower, and there are yellow stripes or streaks in the mouth.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>flowers</b> <b>are</b> insect pollinated, {{the major}} pollinators being bees, butterflies, flies, and hawkmoths, while the highly scented night {{flowering}} N. viridiflorus is pollinated by crepuscular moths. Pollination mechanism fall {{into three groups}} corresponding to floral morphology (see Description - Flowers).|$|E
5|$|Other {{arts and}} leisure {{activities}} {{described in the}} fifth sub-book include activities such as garland making and perfumery, wherein <b>the</b> <b>flowers</b> <b>are</b> arranged in patterns of pleasing colors and ones that delight the senses. The text lists types of aromatic woods, such as sandalwood and their qualities. The text describes the art of painting as three types — Viddha (representational), Aviddha (sketch, outline) and Bhava (narrative). The text includes a recipe for making various types of paints, as well as crayons for drawing, and then recommends the steps in making a drawing.|$|E
5|$|The family evolved {{approximately}} 52 {{million years}} ago during the Late Cretaceous to Early Paleogene eras. Liliaceae are widely distributed, mainly in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and <b>the</b> <b>flowers</b> <b>are</b> insect pollinated. Many Liliaceae are important ornamental plants, widely grown for their attractive flowers and involved in a major floriculture of cut flowers and dry bulbs. Some species are poisonous if eaten and can have adverse health effects in humans and household pets.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{hibiscus}} <b>flower</b> <b>is</b> traditionally worn by Tahitian and Hawaiian girls. If <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> <b>is</b> worn behind <b>the</b> left ear, {{the woman}} is married or in a relationship. If <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> <b>is</b> worn on <b>the</b> right, she is single or openly available for a relationship. The hibiscus <b>is</b> Hawaii's state <b>flower.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>flower</b> <b>is</b> dull {{purple and}} {{streaked}} with purple-brown. Pointed lobes curl {{away from the}} mouth of <b>the</b> <b>flower,</b> revealing a hairy yellow sterile stamen known as a staminode. <b>The</b> <b>flower</b> <b>is</b> up to 2 centimeters in length.|$|R
50|$|The actual {{shape of}} <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> <b>is</b> an oval pedal. <b>The</b> <b>flower</b> <b>is</b> up to 2.5 centimeters long and have light-colored outer tepals with dark midstripes. The fruit is green and dry at maturity.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>flowers</b> <b>are</b> fed at by a {{range of}} {{nectarivorous}} birds: mainly honeyeaters, including the New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), white-cheeked honeyeater (P. nigra), brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta), singing honeyeater (Lichenostomus virescens), tawny-crowned honeyeater (Gliciphila melanops) and red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata). Lorikeets have also been observed feeding at the flowers, as have insects, including ants, bees, and aphids. Of these, evidence suggests that only birds are effective pollinators. Insects apparently play no role in pollination, since inflorescences do not form follicles when birds are excluded in pollinator exclusion experiments; and pollination by mammals has never been recorded in this species.|$|E
5|$|Banksia aculeata grows slowly, {{generally}} taking five to {{six years}} to flower from seed, {{though there is a}} report of it flowering in three years at Strathmerton in Victoria. Regarding its potential as an ornamental plant, Alex George observes that <b>the</b> <b>flowers</b> <b>are</b> brightly coloured but have a short life and are obscured by the foliage, which is quite prickly. He nonetheless considers both the new foliage and the infructescence attractive. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 5.5 to 6.5. It prefers full sun, although it will grow in partly shaded situations, producing fewer flowers. It will tolerate light pruning.|$|E
5|$|Seeds do {{not require}} any treatment, and take 23 to 50 days to {{germinate}} in cultivation. Banksia caleyi is a medium- to slow-growing plant, taking {{four to five years}} to flower from seed. <b>The</b> <b>flowers</b> <b>are</b> attractive but are obscured by the foliage. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 6 to 7.5. It grows in full sun and partly shaded situations, and tolerates light pruning. Unlike many other Western Australian banksias, Banksia caleyi has had some degree of success in growing in more humid areas, such as Australia's east coast. It attracts pygmy and honey possums in the garden.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> trumpet-shaped <b>flower</b> may <b>be</b> up to 2 centimeters {{long and}} has an upper lip with two lobes and a lower lip with three. <b>The</b> <b>flower</b> <b>is</b> magenta or yellow, and populations {{occasionally}} have plants with both colors. The lower lip of <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> <b>is</b> marked with purplish lines and spots.|$|R
50|$|Biologically, some of <b>the</b> <b>flower's</b> {{characteristics}} <b>are</b> {{very dry}} and abundant. This means that <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> <b>is</b> {{coated with a}} chemical on the outside.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>flower</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> iris.|$|R
5|$|With large {{metallic}} red inflorescences {{and attractive}} feathery leaves that {{are perhaps the}} softest of all Banksia species, B.brownii is highly valued by Australia's horticultural and cut flower industries. Seeds and plants are readily available in Australian nurseries, and it is widely cultivated in areas not exposed to dieback. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 20 to 50 days to germinate. The plant prefers a sheltered position in soil with good drainage, and must be provided with moisture over summer. It grows quickly, but takes several years to flower. Once established, it is frost-tolerant and tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage. <b>The</b> <b>flowers</b> <b>are</b> attractive in late bud, but lose their colour {{as soon as they}} open. Because they are usually surrounded by branchlets, they may be partly hidden by foliage.|$|E
5|$|The {{silver birch}} is a {{medium-sized}} deciduous tree that owes its common {{name to the}} white peeling bark on the trunk. The twigs are slender and often pendulous and the leaves are roughly triangular with doubly serrate margins and turn yellow in autumn before they fall. <b>The</b> <b>flowers</b> <b>are</b> catkins and the light, winged seed get widely scattered by the wind. The silver birch is a hardy tree, a pioneer species, {{and one of the}} first trees to appear on bare or fire-swept land. Many species of birds and animals are found in birch woodland, the tree supports a wide range of insects and the light shade it casts allows shrubby and other plants to grow beneath its canopy. It is planted decoratively in parks and gardens and is used for forest products such as joinery timber, firewood, tanning, racecourse jumps and brooms. Various parts of the tree are used in traditional medicine and the bark contains triterpenes which have been shown to have medicinal properties.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>flowers</b> <b>are</b> {{fragrant}} and bisexual, {{surrounded by}} five unequal, thinly veined, yellowish-white petals. <b>The</b> <b>flowers</b> <b>are</b> about 1.0-1.5cm (1/2") long and 2.0cm (3/4") broad. They grow on slender, hairy stalks in spreading or drooping flower clusters {{which have a}} length of 10–25cm.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> petite tubular <b>flower</b> <b>is</b> no {{more than}} a {{centimeter}} long, the base of its tube encapsulated in a narrow, ribbed calyx of sepals. <b>The</b> <b>flower</b> may <b>be</b> yellow or pink in color and the mouth of <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> <b>is</b> usually dotted with red or purple.|$|R
50|$|The narrow, {{tubular base}} of <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> <b>is</b> {{encapsulated}} in a ribbed calyx of sepals with pointed lobes. <b>The</b> five-lobed <b>flower</b> <b>is</b> almost white, often tinged with pink.|$|R
50|$|Diplacus fremontii is {{an annual}} herb {{with a thin}} stem growing 1 to 20 centimeters tall. The oval leaves are up to 3 centimeters long, the ones higher on the plant hairy in texture. The tubular base of <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> <b>is</b> {{encapsulated}} in a wide, ribbed, hairy calyx of sepals with pointed lobes. The corolla of <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> <b>is</b> reddish-purple with a darker pink throat with a yellow spot.
