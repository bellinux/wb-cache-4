25|$|Taking {{position}} on Missionary Ridge, the brigade was stationed next to Bragg's headquarters, {{half in the}} second line and half in the forward position below the crest. As the army was overwhelmed by the reinforced Union army it <b>tumbled</b> <b>out</b> of position. Parts of the brigade fought in General William B. Bate's makeshift rear-guard and Brigadier Finley receive praise for his command. The brigade continued its service {{through the rest of}} 1863, taking part in the moves of General Johnston. When Colonel Dilworth temporarily took command of a brigade, the regiment was commanded by Lt. Col. Elisha Mashburn.|$|E
25|$|Guevara, {{who viewed}} {{the capture of}} the armored train as a priority, {{successfully}} mobilized the tractors {{of the school of}} Agronomy at the university to raise the rails of the railway. The train was therefore derailed as it transported troops away from the Capiro hill. The officers within <b>tumbled</b> <b>out</b> asking for a truce. At this, ordinary soldiers, whose morale was very low, began to fraternize with the rebels, saying that they were tired of fighting against their own people. Shortly afterwards the armored train was {{in the hands of the}} rebels and its 350 men and officers were transported as prisoners.|$|E
25|$|Both {{aircraft}} collided in cloud at {{an altitude}} of 8400 meters, approximately over Dniprodzerzhynsk. Flight 7880's right wing sliced through Flight 7628's forward fuselage, tearing off part of 7880's right wing, the debris of which was ingested by 7880's right engine. The impact spun 7628 to the right, causing the tails of both aircraft to collide at which time the left engine of 7628 struck the keel of 7880, and 7628's right wing was torn off. Flight 7628 <b>tumbled</b> <b>out</b> of control and broke up, with debris scattered over an area measuring 16 by 3 kilometers. Damage to 7880 included the loss of most of the empennage, one of the engines and a section of the right wing. The pilots of 7880 attempted an emergency landing, but {{at an altitude}} of approximately 4000 meters they lost control and at 13:38 crashed to the ground north-east of Kamianske, completely destroying the aircraft.|$|E

25|$|As this {{subsurface}} {{movement of}} salt shaped the landscape, erosion removed the younger rock layers from the surface. Except for isolated remnants, the major formations {{visible in the}} park today are the salmon-colored Entrada Sandstone, in {{which most of the}} arches form, and the buff-colored Navajo Sandstone. These are visible in layer cake fashion throughout most of the park. Over time, water seeped into the surface cracks, joints, and folds of these layers. Ice formed in the fissures, expanding and putting pressure on surrounding rock, breaking off bits and pieces. Winds later cleaned out the loose particles. A series of free-standing fins remained. Wind and water attacked these fins until, in some, the cementing material gave way and chunks of rock <b>tumbled</b> <b>out.</b> Many damaged fins collapsed. Others, with the right degree of hardness and balance, survived despite their missing sections. These became the famous arches.|$|E
500|$|The cromlech {{consists}} of a northsouth aligned long mound of locally obtained rocks and cobbles, mainly of limestone, revetted by two coursed, dry-stone kerbs of [...] "a fine standard". The inner wall was built using a heavier stone. Trapezoid-shaped and about [...] long, the cromlech tapers from [...] wide at its southern entrance to about [...] at its northern end. The wall at the front, right section, is missing or has collapsed, and the rubble has <b>tumbled</b> <b>out</b> leaving a previously covered orthostat exposed.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{many such}} trademarks, the {{clattering}} closet {{began as a}} one-time stunt, but [...] "the closet" [...] was developed carefully, not being overused (it rarely appeared {{in more than two}} consecutive installments, though it never disappeared for the same length, either, at the height of its identification, and it rarely collapsed at exactly the same time from show to show), and it became the best-known running sound gag in American radio's classic period. Jack Benny's basement vault alarm ran a distant second. Both of these classic sound effects were performed by Ed Ludes and Virgil Rhymer, the Hollywood-based NBC staff sound effects creators. Exactly what <b>tumbled</b> <b>out</b> of McGee's closet each time was never clear (except to these sound-effects men), but what signaled the end of the avalanche was always the same sound: a clear, tiny, household hand bell and McGee's inevitable post-collapse lament. [...] "Fibber McGee's closet" [...] entered the American vernacular as a catchphrase synonymous with household clutter.|$|E

2500|$|Edward S. Holden writes; [...] "He was uniformly {{kind and}} {{considerate}} to his dependents, devotedly {{attached to his}} son Akbar, to his friends, and to his turbulent brothers. The misfortunes of his reign arose in great, from his failure to treat them with rigor." [...] He further writes; [...] "The very defects of his character, which render him less admirable as a successful ruler of nations, make us more fond {{of him as a}} man. His renown has suffered in that his reign came between the brilliant conquests of Babur and the beneficent statesmanship of Akbar; but he was not unworthy to be the son of the one and the father of the other." [...] Stanley Lane-Poole writes in his book [...] "Medieval India"; [...] "His name meant the winner (Lucky/Conqueror), there is no kind in the history to be named as wrong as Humayun", he further writes; [...] "He was in fact unfortunate..........Scarcely had he enjoyed his throne for six months in Delhi when he slipped down from the polished steps of his palace and died in his forty-ninth year (Jan. 24, 1556). If there was a possibility of falling, Humayun was not the man to miss it. He tumbled through his life and <b>tumbled</b> <b>out</b> of it".|$|E
2500|$|After the trawl {{had been}} {{dragging}} {{for some time}} on the ocean bottom in 65 fathoms, it was raised and the crew stood by to receive the catch. Those with experience of mine sweeping during the war were startled when the mine <b>tumbled</b> <b>out</b> on deck. It stood about four feet high with a diameter of two feet and weighed about five cwt. Long immersion and rolling about {{on the ocean floor}} had made the mine harmless. The cap and firing mechanism were gone, and there was no cable. A quantity of explosive still remained. This was taken out and the mine brought back to Sydney where the trawler berthed yesterday morning. Any marks of identification are hidden by a heavy marine growth. Captain J. Farquhar, master of the Koraaga, who gained a knowledge of mines while fishing In the North Sea, said last night that he believed the mine had been cut adrift from a minefield during sweeping, and after going to the bottom was carried south by the current. It was possible, he said, that the Koraaga was responsible for rendering the mine harmless, since she swept the Gabo field with the Brolga and Gunundaal. The Gabo minefield was first discovered by one of the State trawlers, and that before the danger area was properly swept the Cumberland was blown up. [...] "The laying of the mines by the Wolf was very cleverly done," [...] he said. [...] "They were put down at night in an area that was {{in full view of the}} Gabo lighthouse during daylight." [...] The mine will be retained by Mr. Cam among the many curiosities that have been brought back to Sydney by his trawlers.|$|E
2500|$|Lunger {{is perhaps}} most renowned for {{being one of the}} drivers, along with Guy Edwards, Arturo Merzario and Harald Ertl, who saved Niki Lauda from his burning car during the 1976 German Grand Prix. Lunger {{described}} Lauda's accident which occurred on the 2nd lap. He went off at a speed of between [...] and [...] [...] He had apparently crashed on exit, went through a couple of rows of catch fence, up a relatively steep bank, and back {{into the middle of the}} track, the Ferrari on fire. Lunger said that Edwards was able to get by Lauda's car to the left but Lunger was unable to avoid the wrecked Ferrari. He made contact about three quarters on because I was committed to a line and couldn't make it through the debris. Ertl followed, colliding with the Ferrari and knocking it into Lunger's Surtees. Lunger's fire extinguishers were set off by the collision which was fortunate and saved time in the rescue. Lunger got out of his Surtees which was tangled up with the Ferrari. The extinguishers going off had dampened the fire somewhat. Workers arrived and kept the fire down, eventually putting foam on the Ferrari. This enabled Lunger and Merzario to get close to the fire, although they could not free Lauda at first. Lauda was conscious, struggling to get free on his own. Again the fire flared up and kept the men back from the car's side. Lunger jumped on top of the Ferrari and grabbed Lauda by his shoulders. Merzario unbuckled the seatbelts and Lunger and Lauda <b>tumbled</b> <b>out</b> of the car as a portion of the cockpit broke apart. As Lauda and Lunger emerged corner workers put foam on them. They lay for a few seconds in the grass. The burning fuel was moving toward them so Lunger and Lauda walked 6 to 8 steps away from the fire.|$|E
