25|$|I-84 enters New York near Port Jervis via a long {{bridge that}} crosses both the Delaware and Neversink rivers just above their confluence. This bridge is owned and {{maintained}} by the NYSDOT, including the portion in Pennsylvania. Fifty feet (15 m) south of the road is <b>Tristate</b> Rock, where New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania converge. For its first mile in New York, the interstate is immediately north of the New Jersey state line {{in the city of}} Port Jervis. The first exit is signed for US6 and New Jersey Route23, which begins just south of the exit with many gas stations allowing motorists to take advantage of lower fuel taxes in New Jersey.|$|E
500|$|Modern {{proposals}} for {{completion of the}} tunnel have come from New York City Councilman Lewis A. Fidler, who has proposed a one-third of one percent tax for the <b>tristate</b> region {{to pay for the}} construction. The tunnel was one of several projects that could have competed for $3 billion of federal funds that were to have been allocated to the ARC tunnel, which was canceled by New Jersey governor Chris Christie in October 2010. State Senator Diane Savino, whose district includes parts of Staten Island and Brooklyn, supported such a plan, saying, [...] "The MTA should complete a 1912 plan that would have rail and freight access from the terminus of Victory Boulevard to Brooklyn, along 67th Street, then utilize the [...] train along Fourth Avenue." [...] The plan's projected cost would be $3 billion, [...] "the same as a proposed extension of the 7 line under the Hudson River." [...] Supporters stated that a rail tunnel would improve quality of life for Staten Islanders, reduce traffic, and increase the attractiveness of the borough for investment.|$|E
2500|$|It is a {{challenging}} yet popular hike since its summit, along with [...] subpeak South Brace Mountain, are along the [...] South Taconic Trail. Hikers approach the mountain {{either from the}} New York side on the west via the South Taconic or from another trail following the Connecticut-Massachusetts state line on the east, a route {{that allows them to}} visit both the <b>tristate</b> marker and the highest point in Connecticut, near the summit of Mount Frissell, along the way. Brace's bald summit, marked by a large cairn, offers views in all directions, particularly to the Hudson Valley and Catskills to the west.

2500|$|For {{the fiscal}} year 2017 which ended on June 30th, the museum was {{reported}} as having 7 million visitors during the past year, where [...] "37 percent of these were international visitors, while 30 percent came from New York’s five boroughs." [...] Previously in 2016, the museum set a record for attendance, attracting 6.7 million visitors—the highest number since the museum began tracking admissions. Forty percent of the Met's visitors in fiscal year 2016 came from New York City and the <b>tristate</b> area; 41 percent from 190 countries besides the United States. In 2017, the attendance figures indicated seven million annual visitors with 63% of the visitors arriving from outside of New York State.|$|E
2500|$|Roberta Smith {{writing for}} The New York Times in September 2017 voiced growing public concern that {{proposed}} increases in admissions costs {{would have an}} adverse effect upon attendance statistics at the museum. Smith referred to the public perception that such costs would appear [...] "greedy and inapproriate" [...] because [...] "The museum already gets around $39 million a year from its gate -- equal to the entire annual budget of the Brooklyn Museum." [...] Smith's article continued to report the negative response of local communities in the <b>tristate</b> area surrounding the museum which was previously introduced {{in a series of}} articles by Robin Pogrebin written during the 2016-2017 fiscal year at the museum which criticized speculative suggestions among current administrators at the museum that an added revenue stream could be pursued by the museum by rescinding existing museum policy since 1893 allowing for free public access to the museum.|$|E
2500|$|Brodsky, the Chairman of the Met, {{stated that}} after the 2017 {{financial}} setbacks, the Director position would be appointed separately from the position of CEO. Following a commissioned report from the Boston Consulting Group, the current interim CEO, president, and COO of the Met, Daniel Weiss, said that the Met's 2015–2017 financial setbacks were caused by [...] "slowing revenue, rising costs, and too many projects at once." [...] Weiss was further reported as having hired Will Manzer, formerly an executive at Perry Ellis, to help re-invigorate recently declining revenues at the museum. On April 26, Weiss stated that the budget shortfall of $15 million might require a re-assessment and increase in the museum's current admission payment policy. Weiss added that there remained concerns for a sustainable fiscal model for the Met in which city officials [...] "have {{a right to a}} clear understanding of how we would be engaging the public, how we balance access with sustainability." [...] In May 2017, the Met filed formal proposal to attempt to charge admission fees to out-of-state visitors. Robin Pogrebin, writing for the Times, reported that the request for out-of-state admissions would call for the re-legislation of the New York State 1893 Act which requires that the museum's collections [...] "shall be kept open and accessible to the public free of all charge throughout the year," [...] and any unlegislated changes would be subject to challenge by the New York State attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, or one of the <b>tristate</b> counselors, Christopher Porrino or George Jepsen.|$|E
50|$|Power use can {{be reduced}} by {{lowering}} the clock rate to what is needed, by turning off unneeded cogs (which then use little power), and by reconfiguring I/O pins which are unneeded, or can be safely placed in a high-impedance state (<b>tristated),</b> as inputs. Pins can be reconfigured dynamically, but again, the change applies to all cogs, so synchronizing is important for certain designs. Some protection is available for situations where one core attempts to use a pin as an output while another attempts {{to use it as}} an input; this is explained in Parallax's technical reference manual.|$|R
40|$|Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) {{offers a}} new {{computing}} paradigm in nanotechnology and is being considered as the future alternative to state-of-the art CMOS designs. The first introduced logic element, the Majority Voter (MV) led to prohibitively large and complex circuits having both uncomplemented and complemented variables. Subsequently many proposals have been made namely AOI and NNI to overcome these shortcomings. In this work we focus on a novel nanostructure (DPNNI) with double polarisation inputs which uses NAND/NOR gates as the basic building blocks, similar to conventional digital logic circuits. Simulation result shows a minimum of 43 % {{to a maximum of}} 176 % reduction in size of circuits with this structure in comparison to that with the AOI and NNI gates. The widespread acceptance of QCA in logic design demands investigation of defect tolerance of QCA circuit elements. Hence the defect tolerance of the proposed structure with respect to misalignment of the cells in the NAND/NOR structure have also been analyzed. Noise margin is an important figure of merit in digital circuits. The Noise Margin of this proposed structure has also been studied and it is shown to exhibit a high impedance state corresponding to a <b>tristated</b> structure. The fault tolerant properties of the proposed universal gate has been evaluated through simulation with QCA Designer...|$|R
40|$|Bioturbational Ammensalism (BAM) {{occurs when}} organisms {{burrowing}} in the sediment (bioturbators) disrupt primary sedimentary fabric {{and in the}} process have significant adverse effects on immobile, free-living, benthic organisms. The concept of BAM is very similar to the Bulldozer Hypothesis (Thayer, 1979; 1983) which suggested that this ammensal relationship resulted in a significant decrease in free living sessile epibenthic organisms and ultimately a “race” for hard substrates. ^ A suite of methods are developed and applied here in order to rigorously test Bioturbational Ammensalism. These methods include: (1) Ichnology, identification of the bioturbators, and their ammensal potential; (2) Faunal Evaluation, quantitative measurement of faunal elements, identification, and trophic group assignment; (3) Taphonomy, the condition and apparent history of the fossils identified; (4) Bed Thickness, number and thickness of distinct lithologic units; and (5) Percent Bioturbation, a quantitative measurement of the amount of bioturbation in hand specimens. The methods are applied to formations within the Lower Devonian Helderberg and <b>Tristates</b> Groups of eastern New York State, which represent Inner, Middle, and Outer Shelf environments. These formations were chosen because their paleoenvironments are well understood, they were deposited in a single basin of deposition, and the same paleoenvironments recurred after ∼ 7 million years. ^ Results show that the Inner Shelf environment had no trace fossils and thus no BAM could be detected. The Middle Shelf showed a slight increase in bedding thickness coupled with an overall statistically significant increase in bioturbation, and a significant decrease in faunal abundance. Similarly, overtime, the Outer Shelf showed an increase in bedding thickness, an increase in bioturbation, and a decrease in faunal abundance. However, changes in bed thickness and Percent Bioturbation were not significant between most Outer Shelf formations of different ages. These results suggest that BAM was occurring in the Middle Shelf environment and potentially was occurring in the Outer Shelf environment. ...|$|R

50|$|All {{the outputs}} {{used to drive}} a Charlieplexed display must be <b>tristate.</b> If the current is low enough to drive the {{displays}} directly by the I/O pins of the microcontroller, {{this is not a}} problem, but if external tristates must be used, then each <b>tristate</b> will generally require two output lines to control, eliminating most of the advantage of a Charlieplexed display. Since the current from microcontroller pins is typically limited to 20 mA or so, this severely restricts the practical size of a Charlieplexed display.
