25|$|Although pure <b>tabun</b> is clear, less-pure <b>tabun</b> may be brown. It is a {{volatile}} chemical, although less so than either sarin or soman.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} <b>tabun</b> appear slowly when <b>tabun</b> is absorbed {{through the skin}} rather than inhaled. A victim may absorb a lethal dose quickly, {{although}} death may be delayed for one to two hours. A person's clothing can release the toxic chemical for up to 30 minutes after exposure. Inhaled lethal dosages kill in one to ten minutes, and liquid absorbed through the eyes kills almost as fast. However, people who experience mild to moderate exposure to <b>tabun</b> can recover completely, if treated {{almost as soon as}} exposure occurs. The LCt50 for <b>tabun</b> is about 400mg-min/m3.|$|E
25|$|The US {{once had}} a <b>tabun</b> {{production}} program, which ended many decades ago. Like the other Allied governments, the Soviets soon abandoned <b>Tabun</b> (GA) for Sarin (GB) and Soman (GD). Large quantities of the German-manufactured agent were dumped into the sea to neutralize the substance.|$|E

50|$|In October 2006, <b>Tabuns</b> {{was voted}} Best MPP by Now Magazine readers, for his {{positions}} on climate change, the Portlands Energy Centre, and early childhood learning centres in his constituency. <b>Tabuns</b> {{has also been}} known for his stance on same-sex parental rights, anti-toxics legislation and recognition of foreign credentials. In the same month, <b>Tabuns</b> was recognized for tabling a motion to recognize June 22, 2006 as Chinese Canadian Head Tax Redress Day.|$|R
5000|$|In 1997 the {{amalgamation}} of Metropolitan Toronto {{reduced the}} number of councillor positions. <b>Tabuns</b> was forced to compete with fellow NDP councillors Pam McConnell (who had previously represented Ward 7, adjacent to Tabuns' Ward 8) and Jack Layton (who had held a seat on Metro Council representing the same area as Wards 7 and 8) for one of two council positions returned by the east-end ward. A phantom candidate named [...] "Larry Tabin" [...] also entered the election. It has been alleged that Tabin was enlisted as a candidate by bar and restaurant owners seeking to defeat <b>Tabuns</b> over his anti-smoking initiative; despite his presence on the ballot, Tabin did not actually conduct any visible campaign. In the confusion, Tabin was able to draw enough votes away from Peter <b>Tabuns</b> to cost <b>Tabuns</b> the election. <b>Tabuns</b> came in third, with about 200 fewer votes than McConnell.|$|R

25|$|<b>Tabun</b> or GA is an {{extremely}} toxic chemical substance. It is a clear, colorless, and tasteless liquid with a faint fruity odor. It is classified as a nerve agent because it fatally interferes with normal functioning of the mammalian nervous system. Its production is strictly controlled and stockpiling outlawed by the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993. <b>Tabun</b> {{is the first of}} the G-series nerve agents along with GB (sarin), GD (soman) and GF (cyclosarin).|$|E
50|$|Following the {{resignation}} of party leader Howard Hampton in June 2008, Peter <b>Tabuns</b> was mentioned in the press as a likely candidate in the emerging campaign for the leadership. On October 27, 2008, <b>Tabuns</b> officially launched his campaign for the leadership. The party's leadership convention was held in March 2009. <b>Tabuns</b> lost to Andrea Horwath {{by a margin of}} 60% to 40% on the third ballot following the defeat of contenders Michael Prue and Gilles Bisson in earlier rounds.|$|R
50|$|From 1999 to 2004, <b>Tabuns</b> was {{executive}} director of Greenpeace Canada. Under Tabuns' leadership, the organization advocated for environmental protection, including {{the adoption of the}} Kyoto Protocol. <b>Tabuns</b> also served as special advisor on climate change to Jack Layton from 2004 to 2005.|$|R

25|$|During the Nuremberg Trials, Albert Speer, Minister of Armaments and War Production for the Third Reich, {{testified that}} {{he had planned to}} kill Adolf Hitler in early 1945 by {{introducing}} <b>tabun</b> into the Führerbunker ventilation shaft. He said his efforts were frustrated by the impracticality of <b>tabun</b> and his lack of ready access to a replacement nerve agent, and also by the unexpected construction of a tall chimney that put the air intake out of reach.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of exposure include: nervousness/restlessness, miosis (contraction of the pupil), rhinorrhea (runny nose), excessive salivation, dyspnea (difficulty in breathing due to bronchoconstriction/secretions), sweating, bradycardia (slow heartbeat), loss of consciousness, convulsions, flaccid paralysis, loss of bladder and bowel control, apnea (breathing stopped) and lung blisters. The exact {{symptoms of}} overexposure {{are similar to}} those created by all nerve agents. <b>Tabun</b> is toxic even in minute doses. The number and severity of symptoms which appear vary according to the amount of the agent absorbed and rate of entry of it into the body. Very small skin dosages sometimes cause local sweating and tremors accompanied with characteristically constricted pupils with few other effects. <b>Tabun</b> is about half as toxic as sarin by inhalation, but in very low concentrations it is more irritating to the eyes than sarin. Also, <b>tabun</b> breaks down slowly, which after repeated exposure can lead to build up in the body.|$|E
25|$|Producing or {{stockpiling}} <b>tabun</b> {{was banned}} by the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention. The worldwide stockpiles declared under the convention were 2 tonnes, and as of December 2015 these stockpiles had been destroyed.|$|E

25|$|During the Iran–Iraq War of 1980 to 1988, Iraq {{employed}} {{quantities of}} chemical weapons against Iranian ground forces. Although {{the most commonly used}} agents were mustard gas and sarin, <b>tabun</b> and cyclosarin were also used.|$|E
25|$|Treatment for {{suspected}} <b>tabun</b> poisoning {{is often}} three injections of a nerve agent antidote, such as atropine. Pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM Cl) also {{works as an}} antidote; however, it must be administered within minutes to a few hours following exposure to be effective.|$|E
25|$|Each of the CAIS held {{between one}} and five {{different}} chemical agents. The agents used in CAIS were phosgene, adamsite, lewisite, cyanogen chloride, chloroacetophenone, sarin, nitrogen mustard, sulfur mustard and chloropicrin. In addition, triphosgene, a phosgene simulant, and ethyl malonate, a <b>tabun</b> simulant were also used. Sarin was the only nerve agent used in CAIS.|$|E

25|$|Almost 71,000 bombs {{containing}} the nerve agent <b>Tabun</b> had been seized in Germany {{at the end}} of the war, and these were stored in the open at RAF Llandwrog, until 1954 when, in Operation Sandcastle, they were transported to Cairnryan for disposal aboard scuttled ships at sea, 120 miles (190km) north-west of Ireland.|$|E
25|$|In both Axis and Allied nations, {{children}} in school were taught to wear gas masks in case of gas attack. Germany developed the poison gases <b>tabun,</b> sarin, and soman during the war, and used Zyklon B in their extermination camps. Neither Germany nor the Allied nations used any of their war gases in combat, despite maintaining large stockpiles and occasional calls for their use. Poison gas {{played an important role}} in the Holocaust.|$|E

25|$|Because {{of safety}} issues, {{phosgene}} is often produced and consumed {{within the same}} plant, and extraordinary measures are made to contain it. It is listed on schedule 3 of the Chemical Weapons Convention: All production sites manufacturing more than 30 tonnes per year must be declared to the OPCW. Although less dangerous than many other chemical weapons, such as sarin, phosgene is still regarded as a viable chemical warfare agent {{because it is so}} easy to manufacture when compared to the production requirements of more technically advanced chemical weapons such as the first-generation nerve agent <b>tabun.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the Carmel {{mountain}} range at el-Tabun, and Es Skhul, Neanderthal and early modern human remains were found, including {{the skeleton of}} a Neanderthal female, named <b>Tabun</b> I, which is {{regarded as one of}} the most important human fossils ever found. The excavation at el-Tabun produced the longest stratigraphic record in the region, spanning 600,000 or more years of human activity, from the Lower Paleolithic to the present day, representing roughly a million years of human evolution. Other notable Paleolithic sites include caves Qesem and Manot. The oldest fossils of anatomically modern humans found outside Africa are the Skhul and Qafzeh hominids, who lived in northern Israel 120,000 years ago. Around 10th millennium BCE, the Natufian culture existed in the area.|$|E
25|$|Soldiers {{who claimed}} to have been exposed to {{chemical}} warfare have often presented with unusual medical conditions which has led to much controversy. The lack of information has left doctors, patients, and their families in the dark in terms of prognosis and treatment. Nerve agents such as sarin, <b>tabun,</b> and soman are believed to have the most significant long-term health effects. Chronic fatigue and memory loss have been reported to last up to three years after exposure. In the years following World War One, there were many conferences held in attempts to abolish the use of chemical weapons all together, such as The Washington Conference (1921–22), Geneva Conference (1923–25) and the World Disarmament Conference (1933). Although the United States was an original signatory of the Geneva Protocol in 1925, the US Senate did not formally ratify it until 1975.|$|E
