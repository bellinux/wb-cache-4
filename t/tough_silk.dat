50|$|Shelters collectively {{built by}} {{caterpillars}} {{play an important}} role in antipredator defense. The <b>tough</b> <b>silk</b> shell of the nest formed by a colony of E. socialis caterpillars is virtually impregnable to both birds and invertebrate predators. Like many other shelter builders, the resident caterpillars venture from the nest only under the cover of darkness when birds and predatory wasps are inactive. Bound-leaf shelters, and the more loosely spun shelters of the tent caterpillars and the fall webworm, Hyphantria cunea, cannot exclude predators completely but all are likely to be deterred to some degree, providing the residents with greater protection than they would enjoy resting in the open.|$|E
40|$|Silk is {{an ancient}} but remarkably strong, {{extensible}} and tough material made from simple protein building blocks. Earlier work {{has shown that the}} particular molecular geometry of silk with a composite of semi-amorphous and nanocrystalline beta-sheet protein domains provides the structural basis for its characteristic softening-stiffening behavior and remarkable strength at the nanoscale. Yet, an open question remains as to how these nanoscale properties are upscaled so effectively to create strong, extensible and <b>tough</b> <b>silk</b> fibers. Here we discover that the geometric confinement of fibrils to &#x 2248; 50 - 100 nm width and arranged in bundles to form larger-scale silk fibers, is the key to explaining the upscaling of the mechanical properties of silk from the atomistic scale upwards. We find that under this geometric confinement, hundreds of thousands of protein domains unfold simultaneously and thereby act synergistically to resist deformation and failure, providing access to enhanced large-scale strength, extensibility and toughness. Moreover, since the material is in a flaw-tolerant state under this geometric confinement, structural inhomogeneities such as cavities or tears that typically act as stress concentrators do not compromise the material performance. Indeed, experimental work showed that the diameter of silk fibrils that make up larger-scale silk fibers are on the order of 20 - 100 nm, in agreement with our findings. The exploitation of this mechanism in engineering design enables the synthesis of hierarchical fiber materials for superior performance despite limited and inferior building blocks...|$|E

Biomechanical analysis of the two silk threads indicated Nephila pilipes had significantly <b>tougher</b> <b>silk</b> with higher strain capacity than its smaller congener, producing threads with toughness up to 305 MJ/m 3. Within N. pilipes, smaller silk fibrils were produced by larger spiders, yielding tougher threads whose fibril diameter was negatively correlated with silk toughness. In contrast, while spider size was correlated with thread diameter in N. plumipes, there were no clear patterns relating to silk toughness, which suggests that the differences in properties between the silk of the two species arise through differing molecular structure...|$|R

MA <b>silk</b> evolved ~ 376 MYA and identifying how evolutionary changes in proteins influenced silk mechanics {{is crucial for}} biomimetics, but is hindered by high spinning plasticity. We use supercontraction to remove that variation and characterize MA silk across the spider phylogeny. We show that mechanical performance is conserved within, but divergent among, major lineages, evolving in correlation with discrete changes in proteins. Early MA silk tensile strength improved rapidly with the origin of GGX amino acid motifs and increased repetitiveness. Tensile strength then maximized in basal entelegyne spiders, ~ 230 MYA. Toughness subsequently improved through increased extensibility within orb spiders, coupled with the origin of a novel protein (MaSp 2). Key changes in MA silk proteins therefore correlate with the sequential evolution high performance orb spider silk and could aid design of biomimetic fibers...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Interspecific {{coevolution}} is well described, {{but we know}} {{significantly less}} about how multiple traits coevolve within a species, particularly between behavioral traits and biomechanical properties of animals' "extended phenotypes". In orb weaving spiders, coevolution of spider behavior with ecological and physical traits of their webs is expected. Darwin's bark spider (Caerostris darwini) bridges large water bodies, building the largest known orb webs utilizing the <b>toughest</b> known <b>silk.</b> Here, we examine C. darwini web building behaviors to establish how bridge lines are formed over water. We also test the prediction that this spider's unique web ecology and architecture coevolved with new web building behaviors. METHODOLOGY: We observed C. darwini in its natural habitat and filmed web building. We observed 90 web building events, and compared web building behaviors to other species of orb web spiders. CONCLUSIONS: Caerostris darwini uses {{a unique set of}} behaviors, some unknown in other spiders, to construct its enormous webs. First, the spiders release unusually large amounts of bridging silk into the air, which is then carried downwind, across the water body, establishing bridge lines. Second, the spiders perform almost no web site exploration. Third, they construct the orb capture area below the initial bridge line. In contrast to all known orb-weavers, the web hub is therefore not part of the initial bridge line but is instead built de novo. Fourth, the orb contains two types of radial threads, with those in the upper half of the web doubled. These unique behaviors result in a giant, yet rather simplified web. Our results continue to build evidence for the coevolution of behavioral (web building), ecological (web microhabitat) and biomaterial (silk biomechanics) traits that combined allow C. darwini to occupy a unique niche among spiders...|$|R

Silk is an ancient material that is produced in nature by both silkworms and spiders and has been used in textiles for thousands o·f years. Stronger than steel and <b>tougher</b> than Kevlar, <b>silk</b> fibers possess a unique combination of strength and elasticity. Silk is also biodegradable and biocompatible, and {{has been the focus of}} research areas ranging from fiber optics to tissue regeneration. While textile applications utilize raw silkworm silk, biomedical applications rely primarily on regenerated silk, which is derived from silkworm cocoons and reprocessed into the desired material. Additionally, there has been much progress in the area of recombinant silk technology, where genetically engineered proteins are inspired by or mimic: native silk sequences. However, despite major advancements in silk engineering, native silk spinning - a remarkable process that takes place at ambient temperature and pressure- is still not completely understood. Given these gaps in knowledge, it remains a challenge in the field to fabricate a regenerated or recombinant material that can mimic the outstanding properties of native silks. We have developed a novel microfluidic silk processing technique that mimics aspects of silkworm spinning to transform aqueous silk solution into fibers in a highly controlled manner. By altering flow parameters within the device and utilizing post-spin processing, we can tune properties such as fiber diameter and Young's modulus across a broad range for tailored applications. Unlike alternative processing methods, we can fabricate a fiber from as little as 50 micro-liters of silk solution or spin continuously for up to two hours to produce a non-woven mesh from a single fiber approximately 6. 5 meters long. Using this device we have fabricated regenerated silk fibers to investigate cell behavior, incorporated silk fibers into cell sheets to provide structural support, and fabricated non-woven silk meshes for use as structural support layers for multi-layer tissue constructs. We have also spun multiple variants of recombinant silk-like sequences. We have optimized this device for use as a low-volume sequence screening tool as part of a combined computational and experimental approach to further the understanding of both native and recombinant silk protein folding and hierarchical assembly...|$|R
