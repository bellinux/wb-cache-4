Nearly all of these measures have delivered anti-LGB outcomes. While previous studies have found several factors that influence ballot measure and other policy outcomes, many variables likely to influence outcomes have remained untested, and no model as yet provides a thorough explanation of the outcomes. For the 45 state-level cases, an original data set was compiled. The data set covered six <b>test</b> <b>variables</b> to examine their ability to help predict pro-LGB outcomes. IT also covered six control variables that are well established in the existing literature. Bivariate analysis and regression analysis were undertaken to study the <b>test</b> <b>variables</b> for their impact on pro-LGB outcomes.

This study examined the <b>testing</b> <b>variables</b> for a reliable and practical semicircular bending (SCB) fracture test to evaluate the fracture characteristics of asphalt concrete mixtures at intermediate service temperatures. An integrated experimental-statistical approach was employed to identify <b>testing</b> <b>variables</b> by which repeatable SCB test results can be achieved. Using a typical Nebraska asphalt mixture, five critical <b>testing</b> <b>variables</b> (i. e., the number of testing specimens, specimen thickness, notch length, loading rate, and testing temperature) of the SCB test were investigated due to their significant effects on mixture fracture characteristics. Statistical analysis of test results indicated that approximately six specimens/replicates were a reasonable sample size that could properly represent asphalt concrete fracture behavior of a typical dense-graded mixture. Then, the coefficient of variation (COV) of the mixture fracture energy for six specimens was used to evaluate the effects of other remaining <b>test</b> <b>variables.</b> A range of a specimen thickness of 40 to 60 mm, a notch length from 5 to 40 mm, and a testing temperature between 15 and 40 C showed the reasonably low COV value of fracture energy at around or less than 10 %.

The data was gotten from the Records Department, University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada, which ranges from August 2006 to December 2016.

40|$|Abstract. The {{electromigration}} lifetime {{is measured}} {{for a large}} number of copper lines encapsulated in an organosilicate glass low-permittivity dielectric. Three <b>testing</b> <b>variables</b> are used: the line length, the electric current density, and the temperature. A copper line fails if a void near the upstream via grows to a critical volume that blocks the electric current. The critical volume varies from line to line, depending on line-end designs and chance variations in the microstructure. However, the statistical distribution of the critical volume (DCV) is expected to be independent of the <b>testing</b> <b>variables.</b> By contrast, the distribution of the lifetime (DLT) strongly depends on the <b>testing</b> <b>variables.</b> For a void to grow a substantial volume, the diffusion process averages over many grains along the line. Consequently, the void volume as a function of time, V(t), is insensitive to chance variations in the microstructure. As a simplification, we assume that the function V(t) is deterministic, and calculate this function using a transient model. We use the function V(t) to convert the experimentally measured DLT to the DCV. The same DCV predicts the DLT under untested conditions...|$|R

40|$|Granted {{that most}} distresses in asphalt (flexible) {{concrete}} (AC) pavements {{are directly related}} to fracture, it becomes clear that identifying and characterizing fracture properties of AC mixtures is a critical step towards a better pavement design. This thesis examines the <b>testing</b> <b>variables</b> of a reliable and practical semicircular bending (SCB) test for evaluating the fracture characteristics of asphalt concrete mixtures at intermediate service temperature conditions. The first part of this thesis investigates the repeatability of the SCB fracture test method by integrating a statistical-experimental approach to identify <b>testing</b> <b>variables</b> of the SCB test that result in repeatable test results. Toward this end, five <b>testing</b> <b>variables</b> (the number of testing specimens, specimen thickness, notch length, loading rate, and testing temperature) of the SCB test were investigated due to their significant effects on mixture fracture characteristics. After statistical analysis of 18 specimens tested a typical <b>testing</b> <b>variables,</b> approximately, five to six specimens/replicates were found to be a reasonable sample size that could properly represent asphalt concrete fracture behavior using the SCB test method. The coefficient of variation (COV) of the mixture fracture energy was used to evaluate the effect of each variable on the repeatability of test results. A range of 1 mm/min. to 5 mm/min. for the loading rate, a notch length from 5 mm to 25 mm, and a specimen thickness of 40 mm to 60 mm and a testing temperature of 15 - 40 °C showed the lowest variation of fracture energy. The second part of this work is to investigate the sensitivity of the SCB test using the previously determined <b>testing</b> <b>variables.</b> Fourteen different asphalt concrete (AC) mixtures collected from 12 field construction projects in Nebraska were used in this task. The ANOVA test showed statistically significant differences between mixtures at a 95 % confidence level. Tukey’s HSD multiple-comparison analysis found similarities within mixtures of same types and significant difference between mixtures types. In addition, the fracture energy of bituminous mixtures increased with increasing amount of virgin asphalt content in mixture. Overall, the SCB test method developed herein proved to be repeatable and sensitive to changes in mixtures, and thus a promising tool for evaluating the fatigue fracture resistance of AC mixtures.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE—The aim of {{the study}} is to explain the {{persistent}} but puzzling positive correlation of physicians per capita and mortality rates, when income is controlled, which has been reported many times since it was first observed in 1978.  The explanation that is proposed and tested is that expanding urban-industrial regions attract an oversupply of doctors. Also, but independently, rural people migrate to urban-industrial areas where they suffer from the stress of adapting to urban-industrial life. Consequently, their death rates rise.  SOURCE MATERIAL—Using data from the 47  Japanese prefectures, the 3000 + counties of the USA and a set of 29  mostly European countries, the explanation was examined by adding the appropriate <b>test</b> <b>variable</b> to a basic equation linking physicians per capita to mortality, net of income.  RESULTS—The test variables dissolved or reduced the original correlation in two of the three samples, but the signs did not change from positive to negative, as would be expected on the basis of conventional biomedical theory. The available <b>test</b> <b>variable</b> (refugees) did not reduce the correlation for the 29  countries but a particular subset of countries was identified that did.  CONCLUSION—The conceptual and empirical analysis exposed the positive correlation as spurious, but the availability of medical specialists had little impact on mortality rates in competition with the social and economic variables that were used as controls. ...|$|E
