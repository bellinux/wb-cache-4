After his father's choice to sell his younger sister <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> in Kabul, he {{resolves}} to leave Afghanistan, travelling to Pakistan and eventually the United States. He opens an Afghan restaurant there and has a daughter, whom he names after his sister.

5|$|Unlike humans, horses do {{not sleep}} in a solid, {{unbroken}} period of time, but take many short periods of rest. Horses spend four to fifteen {{hours a day in}} standing rest, and from a few minutes to several hours lying down. Total sleep time in a 24-hour period may range from several minutes <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of hours, mostly in short intervals of about 15minutes each. The average sleep time of a domestic horse is said to be 2.9 hours per day.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, the Astronomy Department of Case Western Reserve University made a {{deal with}} the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) to build a new {{observatory}} at Kitt Peak National Observatory to house the Burrell Schmidt. The telescope was moved from Ohio to Arizona in May 1979, and in 1980 the 36-inch reflector on Taylor Road was moved to the Nassau Station. This meant no further astronomical work was done at the Taylor Road facility, and as a result the faculty and resources of the original observatory were moved to the main campus of Case Western Reserve University in 1982. The Taylor Road facility was sold in 1983, was abandoned, and remained neglected until 2005 when it was sold <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> who planned to convert the building into a residence. The plans stalled when its new owner was convicted of mortgage fraud and sent to prison in 2007.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{replaced}} {{a different}} script Whithouse {{had planned to}} write, and {{was designed to be}} a romantic episode that could also be a good introduction to the show. Whithouse chose the setting to be Venice, and vampires soon entered the plot as he felt they belonged in the setting. The episode was filmed in Trogir, Croatia in late 2009, with the old-fashioned village portraying Venice. The episode was seen by 7.68 million viewers in the UK and received an Appreciation Index of 86. The episode received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the comedy, production design, and acting of guests Helen McCrory and Alex Price, but thought that the plot elements were somewhat similar <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of other recent episodes.|$|E
5|$|At this point, US 1/9 turns east off Broad Avenue {{to merge}} onto US 46, {{which is a}} four-lane freeway. This freeway makes a sharp turn to the {{north-northeast}} and has partial interchanges {{at both ends of}} the 5th Street and 6th Street frontage roads, which parallel the freeway through residential areas and provide access to CR 501. US 1/9/46 continue into Fort Lee, where it has access <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> commercial areas before encountering the northern terminus of Route 63 at a westbound exit and eastbound entrance. From here, the highway becomes a surface road that continues past more businesses and homes, angling northeast as it comes to an exit for Main Street. Immediately past this point, the road turns east and encounters a complex interchange with I-95, the eastern terminus of Route 4, and the southern terminus of US 9W. Here, US 1/9/46 all join I-95 and continue to the southeast along a multilane freeway with local-express lane configuration consisting of four local lanes and four express lanes in each direction, passing numerous high-rise buildings as it heads east to the George Washington Bridge over the Hudson River.|$|E
5|$|US 46 {{continues}} southeast as a four-lane freeway, {{with the}} US1-9 ramps following the route {{a short distance}} before merging into the route. At this point, US1-9 become concurrent with US 46 and the freeway makes a sharp turn to the north-northeast. The road has an interchange to the 5th Street and 6th Street frontage roads, which parallel the freeway through residential areas and provide access to CR 501. US1-9/ US46 continue into Fort Lee, where it has access <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> commercial areas via RIRO before encountering the northern terminus of Route 63 at a westbound exit and eastbound entrance. From here, the highway becomes a surface road that continues past more businesses and homes with RIRO access, angling northeast as it comes to an exit for Main Street. Immediately past this point, the road turns east and encounters a complex interchange with I-95, the eastern terminus of Route 4, and the southern terminus of US 9W. Here, US1-9/ US46 all join I-95 (although US46 is unsigned east of this interchange) and continue to the southeast along a multilane freeway with local-express lane configuration consisting of four local lanes and four express lanes in each direction, passing numerous high-rise buildings. The road has an interchange with Route 67 at GWB Plaza {{before coming to the}} eastbound toll plaza for the George Washington Bridge. Past the toll plaza, there is an interchange for the Palisades Interstate Parkway. After the Palisades Interstate Parkway, the road crosses the Hudson River on the George Washington Bridge, which has eight lanes total on the upper deck (formed from the express lanes) and six lanes total on the lower deck (formed from the local lanes). At the New Jersey/New York border on the bridge, US46 ends while I-95 and US1-9 continue into the borough of Manhattan in New York City on the Trans-Manhattan Expressway.|$|E

At first glance nothing seems remarkable about the town, but in fact it is located on the Erie Railroad line, halfway between New York and Chicago, which made it an ideal stopover location for railway patrons. The secondary factor was the local mineral springs which were visited by numerous people seeking to improve their health.|$|E
25|$|The Serbian Despotate {{fell to the}} Ottomans in 1459. The veneration of the Holy Prince Lazar {{was reduced}} to a local cult, centred on the Ravanica Monastery.

The Ottomans reduced its property <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of villages containing 127 households in all, but they exempted Ravanica from some taxes. Italian traveller Marc Antonio Pigafetta, who visited Ravanica in 1568, reported that the monastery was never damaged by the Turks, and the monks practiced freely their religion, except that they were not allowed to ring bells.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s, most {{typically}} {{in the city}} of Bamenda, marches by groups of older women have been referred to as Takembeng. These protests involve groups of 30 <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> hundred older women marching or protesting through the city, often taking part with other political protests affiliated with the main opposition party in Cameroon, the SDF. While the other protesters are quite loud and active at these protests, the Takembeng women remain largely silent while marching (which distinguishes the current manifestations from the earlier versions). Similarly, unlike the earlier practices, these recent movements include women from a variety of different ethnic groups. Although rural women provide a core part of the movement, it also includes urban women who live in Bamenda.|$|E

The need to cope with this phenomenon â€“ 80% of all Reform-raised Jews in the United States wed between 2000 and 2013 were intermarried â€“ led to the recognition of patrilineal descent: all children born <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> in which a single member was Jewish, whether mother or father, was accepted as a Jew on condition that they received corresponding education and committed themselves as such. Conversely, offspring of a Jewish mother only are not accepted if they do not demonstrate affinity to the faith.

25|$|By {{measuring}} an infant's {{attention to}} certain audiovisual stimuli, a response {{that is consistent}} with the McGurk effect can be recorded. From just minutes <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of days old, infants can imitate adult facial movements, and within weeks of birth, infants can recognize lip movements and speech sounds. At this point, the integration of audio and visual information can happen, but not at a proficient level. The first evidence of the McGurk effect can be seen at four months of age; however, more evidence is found for 5-month-olds. Through the process of habituating an infant to a certain stimulus and then changing the stimulus (or part of it, such as ba-voiced/va-visual to da-voiced/va-visual), a response that simulates the McGurk effect becomes apparent. The strength of the McGurk effect displays a developmental pattern that increases throughout childhood and extends into adulthood.|$|E
