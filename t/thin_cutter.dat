For a naked eye, they look simple (lines, crosses, those styled as “goose feet”), but magnifying devices reveal complex compositions made with a <b>thin</b> <b>cutter,</b> which {{can be interpreted as}} “tree,” “scales,” “tent with a flag,” etc. Signs of the kind are well known in the system of symbols adopted in Volga Bulgaria and the Golden Horde. They can be regarded as tamga varieties and were probably marked with protective magic purposes. Some of the signs could symbolize funerals and funerary sacrifices, and were probably used in praying actions...|$|E
40|$|The noodle is {{made from}} wheat flour which very popular in the society, {{especially}} the society of Indonesia. The process of making noodles using manner and traditional tools needed a long time. The aim of {{the design of the}} <b>Thinning</b> and the <b>Cutter</b> Machine of the Noodle Dough is to facilitate the producer lower class noodle in improving the productivity. The <b>Thinning</b> and the <b>Cutter</b> Machine of the Noodle Dough are a tool which serves to flatten and cutting the noodles dough that has been shaped sheet with a large capacity. The existence of <b>Thinning</b> and <b>Cutter</b> Machine of the Noodle Dough will improve the productivity of noodles production. The design of the <b>Thinning</b> and the <b>Cutter</b> Machine of the Noodle Dough through some of steps, namely identification of the expected needs by the user of the <b>Thinning</b> and the <b>Cutter</b> Machine of the Noodle Dough. The need is include the capacity of the <b>Thinning</b> and the <b>Cutter</b> Machine of the Noodle Dough, dimension of the <b>Thinning</b> and the <b>Cutter</b> Machine of the Noodle Dough, and the location of economic level of the <b>Thinning</b> and the <b>Cutter</b> Machine of the Noodle Dough. The next processes are analyzing the weaknesses contained on previous machine and determine the specifications of the <b>Thinning</b> and the <b>Cutter</b> Machine of the Noodle Dough that we make. After determining the specifications, the next step is concept production of the product. Concept production of the product is determining the transmission, the form of every component, and the form arrangement of the <b>Thinning</b> and the <b>Cutter</b> Machine of the Noodle Dough. Then the aim of an analysis technique is to determine the size, and types of materials used. The last of step is modeling of form that pointed the production of the work drawings. The tools are used {{in the design of the}} <b>Thinning</b> and the <b>Cutter</b> Machine of the Noodle Dough are a Notebook, a Mouse, a Keyboard, the Software Inventor Professional 2012, a calculator, a Printer, the paper HVS A 4. 	The results achieved of the <b>Thinning</b> and the <b>Cutter</b> Machine of the Noodle Dough needs energy as big as 440 N, the power of electric motors is used 373 watt with 1400 rpm. The motor speed is reduced become 34 rpm. The transmission is used 2 types, namely the first is from electric motors transmitted to the pulley with diameter the pulley 1 sized 2 inch, the pulley 2 sized 6 inch, the pulley 3 sized 2 inch, and the pulley 4 sized 7 inch. The transmission of the second type, namely 4 straight gears with size the gear in diameter 55 mm, z = 18 dan. The shaft which used is the material of ST- 60 diameter 54 mm. The material of dough channel is using Stainless Steel to withstand corrosion. The frame of table is using the material of an elbow plate the diameter 40 mm x 40 mm x 4 mm. The material casing is using Stainless Steel. ...|$|R

Metallic bipolar {{plates with}} unique wave-like microstructure {{on the bottom}} of microflow channel have shown promising prospects for the application in proton exchange membrane microfuel cell. A novel method—milling with special <b>thin</b> slotting <b>cutters</b> is developed for fabrication of wave-like microstructure {{on the bottom of}} microflow channels. The special <b>thin</b> slotting <b>cutter</b> is manufactured by removing one or several teeth every one tooth of the traditional slotting cutter regularly. Forming mechanism of wave-like microstructure is presented and experimental tests have been conducted for validation of the feasibility of the novel method. Results show that the wave-like microstructure can be successfully fabricated on the bottom of microflow channel. The bottom of bipolar plates with wave-like microstructure is not a flat plane, but a wavy groove. The wavelength and amplitude of wave-like microstructure increase with the increase of feed speed and the number of removed teeth...|$|R
