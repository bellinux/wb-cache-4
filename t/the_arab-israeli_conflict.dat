5|$|By 1972 the United States and the Soviet Union {{were focused}} on détente. The Arabs were worried, as it meant their {{military}} situation in regards to Israel would remain at a disadvantage. Believing diplomatic avenues had reached a dead end, Sadat focused on taking decisive military action. A renewed conflict with Israel would disrupt Soviet-American détente, force superpower intervention and make the solution of <b>the</b> <b>Arab-Israeli</b> <b>conflict</b> a center-stage issue to Israel, the US and the USSR.|$|E

50|$|On {{the issue}} of energy security, China relies mainly on Persian Gulf exports. In {{contrast}} with the USA, China is not associated with <b>the</b> <b>Arab-Israeli</b> <b>conflicts</b> and may focus simply on oil supply from an economic standpoint. The increase in Chinese dependence on Persian Gulf oil also means an associated increasing economic dependence on Arabian exporters, who will probably not join hands to block exports to China.|$|R

5|$|Indeed, since Willy Brandt {{had become}} {{chancellor}} in 1969, {{there had been}} a change of the West German attitude towards <b>the</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> <b>conflict.</b> The earlier conservative governments had been considered pointedly pro-Israel (especially during the mid-1960s with the Six-Day War), which had resulted in a number of Arab states breaking off diplomatic relations to West Germany. With Egypt and Tunisia, these had only been restored shortly before the 1972 Olympics.|$|E
5|$|After the war {{the gun was}} {{supplied}} to many countries around the globe, including former Warsaw Pact allies, such as Poland. As of the early 2000s it remains in service in Afghanistan, Albania, China, Cuba, Hungary, Iraq, Mozambique, Syria, Vietnam and other countries. The gun was employed in <b>the</b> <b>Arab-Israeli</b> <b>Conflict</b> and also in some conflicts in former republics of Soviet Union. The long operational history of D-1 howitzers in the national armies of numerous countries is an additional testimony to its qualities.|$|E
5|$|In China, {{nationalist}} and communist forces resumed {{the civil}} war in June 1946. Communist forces were victorious and established the People's Republic of China on the mainland, while nationalist forces retreated to Taiwan in 1949. In the Middle East, the Arab rejection of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and the creation of Israel marked the escalation of <b>the</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> <b>conflict.</b> While European powers attempted to retain some or all of their colonial empires, their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful, leading to decolonisation.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Arab-Israeli</b> <b>conflicts</b> were {{a series}} of wars between the country of Israel and its {{surrounding}} Arab neighbors. Those that involved dogfighting occurred between 1948 and 1985. The wars escalated on 14 May 1948, the day Israel declared its sovereignty from Britain. The War of Independence {{was followed by the}} Suez-Sinai War in 1956, the Six-Day War in 1967, the War of Attrition, the Yom Kippur War in 1973, and the First Lebanon War in the early 1980s.|$|R
5|$|Jennings was {{determined}} to build his journalism credentials abroad. In 1968, he established ABC's Middle East bureau in Beirut, Lebanon, the first American television news bureau in the Arab world. The next year, he demonstrated his growing expertise in Middle Eastern affairs with Palestine: New State of Mind, a well-received half-hour documentary for ABC's Now news program. As ABC's Beirut bureau chief, Jennings soon became familiar with the intricacies of <b>the</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> <b>conflict,</b> including {{the rise of the}} Palestinian Black September Organization during the early 1970s. He conducted the first American television interview with Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat. While stationed in the Lebanese capital, Jennings dated Palestinian activist Hanan Ashrawi, who was then a graduate student in literature at the American University in Beirut.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Nixon Doctrine {{that the}} U.S. would avoid direct combat {{assistance}} to allies where possible, instead giving them assistance to defend themselves, the U.S. greatly increased arms sales to the Middle East—particularly Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia—during the Nixon administration. The Nixon administration strongly supported Israel, an American ally in the Middle East, but the support was not unconditional. Nixon believed that Israel should make peace with its Arab neighbors and that the United States should encourage it. The president believed that—except during the Suez Crisis—the U.S. had failed to intervene with Israel, and should use the leverage of the large U.S. military aid to Israel to urge {{the parties to the}} negotiating table. <b>The</b> <b>Arab-Israeli</b> <b>conflict</b> was not a major focus of Nixon's attention during his first term—for one thing, he felt that no matter what he did, American Jews would oppose his reelection.|$|E

The conflict became a major international issue with the birth of Israel in 1948. <b>The</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> <b>conflict</b> has resulted in at least five major wars and a number of minor conflicts. It has also been the source of two major Palestinian uprisings (s).|$|E
