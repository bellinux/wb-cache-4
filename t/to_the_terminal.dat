5|$|In {{addition}} to housing {{the rental car}} facilities, a six-story parking garage (which is attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terminal)</b> provides long-term and short-term parking. Lower cost satellite parking options, with continuous free shuttle service, {{can be found in}} the Blue, Red and Green parking lots along International Gateway. The Blue lot is the closest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> and also offers some covered parking. The cost of parking a car in the blue lot is $9 per 24 hours. The Red Lot costs $7 per 24 hours and the green lost costs $5 per 24 hours to park.The Green lot is the furthest away from the terminal. Additionally, there is a free cell phone lot accessed from the outbound side of International Gateway.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the ceramic}} {{fragments}} recovered from Panorama Sector, 374 pieces have been dated to the Late Classic, representing 62% {{of the total}} ceramics found in the sector. The vast majority of these are domestic in nature. 234 pieces were dated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terminal</b> Classic, representing the remaining 38%.|$|E
5|$|Pits sunk {{within the}} {{courtyard}} of the acropolis revealed 5425 ceramic fragments, 22 fragments of zoomorphic figurines, together with stone and shell artefacts, animal bones and waste flint chips, all dated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terminal</b> Classic.|$|E

5|$|Two {{distinct}} architectural styles date to {{the last}} period of the site's occupation in the Late Classic. One uses well-carved stone blocks for construction and is possibly earlier than the second style, which is believed to date <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terminal</b> Classic and uses thin, flat stones.|$|E
5|$|Chachaklum's {{principal}} phase of occupation appears to date <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terminal</b> Classic period, during the 10th and 11th centuries AD. However, the site possesses massive basal platforms and these, {{together with the}} presence of the E-Group, suggests a longer occupational period than was immediately evident from the first excavations of the site. Further investigations have revealed a long occupational history beginning in the Late Preclassic period and continuing right through to the Late Classic.|$|E
5|$|Group 13 and Group 15 {{are located}} {{just outside the}} {{protected}} archaeological zone, opposite the custodian's house. Group 15 is situated immediately north of Group 13 and some structures are shared by both groups. Ceramic fragments recovered from the two groups have been dated to the Late Preclassic, Late Classic, Terminal Classic and Postclassic, with the majority dating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terminal</b> Classic.|$|E

An LMI based optimization approach is developed <b>to</b> choose <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> weighting item and fictitious terminal stabilizing control law so as <b>to</b> enlarge <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> region of <b>the</b> non-linear MPC method. The proposed method is illustrated by a numerical example and compares favourably with existing results...|$|R
5|$|Group A is in {{the site}} core. It {{features}} three plazas, the North, South and Central Plazas and lies at {{the west end of}} CausewayI. GroupA has more than fifty mounds arranged around the three plazas. Monuments dating to the period when Seibal was a vassal of Dos Pilas (AD 735761) are situated in the Central Plaza of the group. In this group, there is also a ball court that is dated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terminal</b> Classic and stylistically resembles that at Uxmal.|$|E
5|$|Some {{elements}} of the station, including the size of internal support structures, the amount of glass panels, and {{the width of the}} roof, were eliminated or reduced to save $20 million in construction costs. Moving walkways and electric carts were both considered and rejected for the station because of engineering difficulties and cost. In 2017, the Port of Seattle began a $3.5 million capital program to improve the walk from the station <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> by installing windscreens and adding a cart shuttle service.|$|E
5|$|Ancient DNA and {{radiocarbon}} data {{indicates that}} local genetic populations {{were replaced by}} others within the same species or by others within the same genus. Both the dire wolf and the Beringian wolf went extinct in North America, leaving only the less carnivorous and more gracile form of the wolf to thrive, which may have outcompeted the dire wolf. Dire wolf remains having the youngest geological ages are dated at 9,440YBP at Brynjulfson Cave, Boone County, Missouri, 9,860YBP at Rancho La Brea, California, and 10,690YBP at La Mirada, California. Dire wolf remains have been radiocarbon dated to 8,200YBP from Whitewater Draw in Arizona, However, one author has stated that radiocarbon dating of bone carbonate {{is known to be}} unreliable, and that while many dire wolf remains are found in fossil assemblages dated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> Pleistocene, there are no confirmed Holocene finds.|$|E
50|$|Often a given {{transistor}} type {{is available}} in several packages. Transistor packages are mainly standardized, but the assignment of a transistor's functions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terminals</b> is not: other transistor types can assign other functions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> package's <b>terminals.</b> Even for <b>the</b> same transistor type <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> assignment can vary (normally indicated by a suffix letter <b>to</b> <b>the</b> part number, q.e. BC212L and BC212K).|$|R

5|$|Armed {{with an air}} gun, Huseby {{threatened}} a cabin attendant and told the captain to proceed as planned to Fornebu. He claimed (falsely) to have placed explosives on board. His demands were to make a political statement and talk to Prime Minister Kåre Willoch and Minister of Justice Mona Røkke. The plane landed at 15:30 at Fornebu and was surrounded by the police. After one hour, Huseby released 70 hostages in exchange for having the aircraft being moved closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> building. Thirty minutes later, Huseby released the remaining passengers. He drank throughout the incident, and at 17:30, after he consumed the plane's beer supply, he surrendered his weapon in exchange for more beer. The plane was immediately stormed and Huseby arrested.|$|E
5|$|As Neerja boards Pan Am 73, it is {{revealed}} that the Abu Nidal organization, a Libyan-sponsored terrorist group, plans to hijack the plane in Karachi. The plane takes off from Mumbai's Sahar International Airport and lands in Karachi, where the four Abu Nidal terrorists, disguised as security officers escorting a Libyan diplomat, hijack the plane. Neerja quickly alerts the cockpit, and the three American pilots escape through the overhead hatch, fleeing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> under fire from the hijackers. The American pilots had {{just enough time to}} escape, as the hijackers did not realize that the cockpit of a Boeing 747 is located upstairs.|$|E
5|$|Ceramics dating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terminal</b> Classic period are {{uncommon}} {{outside of}} the site core, suggesting that {{the population of the}} city was concentrated in the city centre in the final phase of Calakmul's occupation. The majority of the surviving population probably consisted of commoners who had occupied the elite architecture of the site core but the continued erection of stelae into the early 10th century and the presence of high status imported goods such as metal, obsidian, jade and shell, indicate a continued occupation by royalty until the final abandonment of the city. The Yucatec-speaking Kejache Maya who lived in the region at the time of Spanish contact in the early 16th century may have been the descendants of the inhabitants of Calakmul.|$|E
50|$|Passengers driving {{their own}} cars can park in {{multilevel}} parking garages (mostly underground) along <b>the</b> <b>terminals.</b> A long term holiday {{parking lot is}} located south of the runways and connected by shuttle bus <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terminals.</b>|$|R

5|$|Construction {{started in}} 1973. The airport {{needed to be}} built on permafrost. The runway is {{insulated}} against the ground, so it will not melt during the summer. The hangar is frozen into the ground, with the pillars being melted into place and then being frozen stuck. The runway was plagued with frost heave due to an incorrect construction method, forcing the airport to regularly re-asphalt the runway. In 1989, parts of the runway were re-insulated, giving these areas that previously had been the worst an acceptable solution. In 2006, this measure {{was conducted on the}} remaining parts of the runway. An upgrade <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> building to allow larger capacity was completed in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Huseby's demands were {{to talk to}} Prime Minister Kåre Willoch and Minister of Justice Mona Røkke, {{both from}} the Conservative Party. He also wanted to hold a press conference at Fornebu. Huseby was {{unsatisfied}} with his treatment after he left prison. He demanded to receive guarantees for a better treatment and economic security from the authorities. Assisted by a psychologist, the police negotiated with Huseby. One hour after the plane landed, 70 passengers were let out of the plane. The first group were those passengers who had or claimed they had transfers to other flights. In exchange, the aircraft was moved closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> building. The passengers were {{picked up by a}} bus and transported to the domestic terminal, where they were questioned by the police. The remaining passengers were let out thirty minutes later. Only the five crew members remained.|$|E
5|$|On June 5, a storm system caused damage {{throughout}} the Great Plains. The most substantial damage occurred in Altus, Oklahoma, where 179homes sustained {{some form of}} damage, with two destroyed, five with major damage, 43with minor damage and 129affected. Seventeen businesses were damaged, with two destroyed, four with major damage and eight with minor damage. A school in Mulvane, Kansas had roof damage and there was significant roof damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> building at an airport near Winfield. In Lawrence, The Wakarusa Music and Camping Festival shut down while the storm passed through. On June 8, thunderstorms affected areas across the Great Lakes region. Two {{people were killed in}} Ottawa County, Michigan due to the straight-line winds that toppled trees; one onto a pedestrian and another onto a car. In Eaton County, a woman was killed by winds which blew a large trailer on to her. Over 300,000people in Michigan were left without power due to the storm.|$|E
