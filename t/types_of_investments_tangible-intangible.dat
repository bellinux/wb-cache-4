40|$|The {{risk-adjusted}} {{social rate}} of return remains substantially lower for housing than for other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment.</b> Savvy investors allocate their resources across different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> to maximize their returns; savvy societies do likewise. Just as with the private sector, society’s returns are maximized when risk-adjusted social rates of return equalize across all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> (Auerbach 1983; Hendershott 1987). After all, if these rates of return are not equal, society could increase its income by shifting resources from low-return investments into those with a higher return. Unfortunately, while market arbitrage ensures that risk-adjusted private rates of return equalize, no similar mechanism exists to guarantee that social rates of return do the same. Thus, society may invest relatively too much in some <b>types</b> <b>of</b> capital and relatively too little in others. History suggests that the United States overinvests in housing. Estimates of the social {{rate of return}} are substantially lower for housing than for other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment.</b> Mills (1989) finds the social rate of return to housing was only 20 percent of that to nonhousing fixed capital, on average, over the period 1929 – 86. McMahon (1991) extends the scope of Mills’ analysis {{to find that the}} social rate of return to housing was also substantially lower than that to education over the period 1967 – 86. Researchers have concluded from this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> evidence — together with evidence on the relative risk <b>of</b> housing <b>investments</b> — that the United States overinvested in housing before 1986 (fo...|$|R
