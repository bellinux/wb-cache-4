Here, it is Tristan's jealous slave Rosen who tricks the lovers into drinking the love potion, then denounces them to Mark.

25|$|Terrorist Recognition Handbook: A Practitioner's Manual for Predicting and Identifying Terrorist Activities is a non-fiction {{book about}} counterterrorism strategies, written by U.S. Navy retired {{cryptology}} analyst Malcolm Nance. The book {{is intended to}} help law enforcement and intelligence officials with the professional practice of behavior analysis and criminal psychology of anticipating potential terrorists before <b>they</b> <b>commit</b> criminal acts. Nance draws {{from the field of}} traditional criminal analysis to posit that detecting domestic criminals is similar to determining which individuals are likely to commit acts of terrorism. The book provides resources for the law enforcement official including descriptions of devices used for possible bombs, a database of terrorist networks, and a list of references used. Nance gives the reader background on Al-Qaeda tactics, clandestine cell systems and sleeper agents, and terrorist communication methods.|$|E
25|$|The Holy See put King Thomas {{under its}} {{protection}} in 1455, and promised {{that he would}} be given back the lands taken by Turks and his treacherous magnates if the Christians defeated the Ottomans. In 1456, Thomas sent a letter to Pope Callixtus III asking him to find a bride for his son Stephen, hoping that the Holy See would provide him with a daughter-in-law of royal blood. Preparations were under way for another Ottoman attack on Hungary in the beginning of that year. The Ottoman sultan Mehmed the Conqueror issued unusual demands to the King of Bosnia and his nobles, the Kosačas and the Pavlović family. Thomas was requested to send 10.000 loads of food, his father-in-law 8.000 and Petar Pavlović 4.000. Mehmed also demanded that <b>they</b> <b>commit</b> their troops and personally take part in the war on Ottoman side. From Thomas he further requested cession of four towns: two in the middle of Bosnia and two bordering Hungary and Venetian Dalmatia. All this was refused.|$|E

The final rebel officer to commit suicide was Kōno, still hospitalized from the failed attack on Makino, who stabbed himself with a knife a week later.

500|$|The episode also {{deals with}} the Book of Revelation, {{particularly}} verse 1:18, [...] "I am he that liveth, and was dead; and behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys to Hell and of death". The Millennium Group believes that the four chosen members are the prophesied Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse; although the group believes that fate is predetermined, they believe they can help by [...] "making it happen themselves". Thus, <b>they</b> <b>commit</b> suicide {{in order to be}} resurrected as the Four Horsemen. Donaldson argues that Johnson and the Millennium Group have taken Jesus' promise of eternal life and resurrection too literally, resulting in [...] "a recreated cycle in this life rather than escape into the next". This is further proved when the four Millennium Group members return as zombies; they have achieved life after death, but only physically—not spiritually—by [...] "abusing Jesus's words to take their fate into their own hands".|$|E
500|$|The factory {{supervisor}} belatedly {{realizes that}} the gender disparity is impairing morale and productivity, so he arranges for an army officer to organize military maneuvers near the town {{in order for the}} factory to sponsor a big dance, at which the workers can find male companionship among the soldiery. [...] "They need what we needed when we were young", he explains to a sympathetic officer. Anticipation runs high on both sides, with the girls expecting to meet the young men of their dreams, while the recruits, many of whom are actually middle-aged reservists, out-of-shape and already married, look forward to a night of revelry and seduction. The night of the party is a disappointment for some members of both groups; Andula and her friends are repulsed by the unappealing soldiers, whom they call [...] "old buffers", and a trio of reservists are so nonplussed by the situation that <b>they</b> <b>commit</b> a series of comic faux pas, like sending a bottle of wine to the wrong table and dropping a wedding ring that one of them is trying to hide, only to watch it roll across the floor and land {{at the feet of the}} young women who are the objects of their lust. [...] For these people, the mixer is a huge flop, with the girls retiring to the lavatory to devise a way to escape their pursuers and the aging reservists arguing with each other over expenses (one points out that [...] "you can only get it [...] free at home") and speculating on the necessity of going to the woods in order to consummate their romantic plans ("Imagine, in this weather!"). For others, however, the dance is a success: the factory supervisor looks on in smug satisfaction as couples throng the crowded dance floor, one girl holds her hands together in a gesture showing her delight and gratitude when she is asked to dance, while an obese, balding soldier capers with a mismatched tall, thin brunette, both clearly having the time of their lives.|$|E

500|$|Sigma Phi Epsilon ("Sig Ep") at Dartmouth College {{was founded}} on April 22, 1908, as the local {{fraternity}} Omicron Pi Sigma. In 1909, the local fraternity became New Hampshire Alpha Chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon. [...] By the late 1960s, the house had become disenchanted with the national organization and felt that the Dartmouth membership {{would be better served}} as a local fraternity. [...] The brothers voted to dissociate from the national organization on January 18, 1967. [...] A vote of the alumni of the New Hampshire Alpha chapter on February 1, 1967, supported the decision. [...] The new local fraternity adopted the name Sigma Theta Epsilon (which was also used by an unrelated national fraternity). The Sigma Phi Epsilon national continued to communicate with the local Sigma Theta Epsilon fraternity at Dartmouth, and by 1981 was willing to offer significant financial support for building renovations in exchange for reaffiliation. [...] Convinced that the national organization had reformed in its commitment to the individual chapters, the local fraternity voted to rejoin Sigma Phi Epsilon on February 18, 1981. The national Sigma Phi Epsilon organization is known for its Balanced Man Program, an ongoing program of development through which members challenge themselves and to use their different talents and backgrounds to help each other become balanced men (having a Sound Mind in a Sound Body) and balanced servant leaders for the world's communities. Members of Sigma Phi Epsilon become members the moment they join the fraternity, without having to endure a traditional pledge period. [...] However, <b>they</b> <b>commit</b> to taking on a series of personal and leadership development challenges {{for the rest of their}} time as an undergraduate. The New Hampshire Alpha Chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon was actually the first chapter to adopt the Balanced Man Program. Prominent alumni of the New Hampshire Alpha chapter include Theodor S.
