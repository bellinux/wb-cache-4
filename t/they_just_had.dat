25|$|Several {{theories}} were {{advanced to}} explain {{the emergence of the}} new virus. These included increased contact between humans and mice due to a 'bumper crop' in the deer mouse population. Another theory was that something within the virus had changed, allowing it to jump to humans. A third theory was that nothing had changed, that hantavirus cases had occurred previously, <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> not been properly diagnosed before. This last theory {{turned out to be the}} correct one when it was discovered that the first known case had actually occurred in a 38-year-old Utah man in 1959.|$|E

500|$|In the Disney Dream {{cruise ship}} show Villains Tonight!, first played in 2010, Hades calls forth Disney's most {{powerful}} villains {{for help to}} regain his evil. The Queen, changing from the Witch form, denies his invitation since Hades also invited Maleficent, her rival for Hades' affections and for the status of [...] "the most evil in the land". The Queen claims not to be Hades' girlfriend, but <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> [...] "an interesting weekend" [...] on Castaway Cay. In the end, the Queen and Maleficent put their differences aside as all villains should stick together and advise Hades to find evil within himself, and not from others.|$|E

We shot it chronologically, which helped. The water was freezing cold. We shot the drowning many, many times. I remember looking down the shore, after I {{had been there for}} five or six hours, and I saw two smiling faces, in the form of Gemma Whelan and Alfie Allen. They were just smiling their asses off, because they weren't cold! <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> to run to the boat." [...] In regards to stunts, Asbæk continued, [...] "I {{got a little bit of}} help, but not much. I think 95 percent of it was me. I like to do all of it when I can, because then I can feel it with the character." ...|$|E
500|$|NY149 between Martindale Road in {{the town}} of Queensbury and the Washington County line was {{upgraded}} by New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) in the late 2000s. Construction began on February 9, 2009 to upgrade the [...] long segment. The project consisted of repaving the roadway in areas, but also included widening the shoulder to [...] wide, reconstructing and straightening NY149 near Martindale Road along with a spot near the Queensbury Country Club. Culverts would be replaced, drainage systems would be upgraded and they would create a new wetland mitigation area aside of NY149. Finally, left turn lanes would be constructed at NY9L and CR7 (Bay Road). Announced alongside of a project to reconstruct NY372, the project would cost $8million (2009USD) and given to Kubricky Construction Corporation, based in Queensbury, with a slated completion date of June2010. However, by July2010, construction had not been completed, as <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> shut down NY149 between NY9L and CR7.|$|E

2500|$|The film officially began {{principal}} {{photography in}} March 2010, {{but due to}} its large cast, producer/director Farrelly told Entertainment Weekly that [...] "This movie was made over four years, and <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> {{to wait for a}} year or two years for different actors. They would shoot for a week, and shut down for several months. Same thing with the directors. It was the type of movie you could come back to."

60|$|Now what old Granny Fox {{had seen}} was Peter Rabbit and Jimmy Skunk and Unc' Billy Possum rolling {{over and over}} in the dried leaves, turning somersaults, and {{shouting}} and laughing, while Prickly Porky sat looking on and smiling. Granny knew well enough what was tickling them so, and she knew too that they didn't dream but that she was still running away in fright. At last they were so tired with their good time that <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> to stop for a rest.|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{the others}} laughed. The {{very idea of}} such a tiny fellow going out to dare {{the dangers of the}} unknown Great World seemed to them so absurd that <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> to laugh. But King Eagle didn't laugh. He thanked Hummer and told him that his heart was as big as his body was small, but that he would not send him out into the Great World, for he would go himself. He had been but trying out his subjects, and he had found but one who was worthy, and that one was the {{smallest}} of them all. Then King Eagle said things that made all the other birds hang their heads for shame and want to sneak out of sight.|$|E

In the middle of a field they met the parson, and when he saw this {{procession}} he cried: 'For shame, you bold girls! What do you mean by running after a young fellow through the fields like that? Do you call that proper behaviour?' And with that he caught the youngest girl by the hand to try and draw her away. But directly he touched her he hung on himself, and had to run {{along with the rest of}} them.|$|E
60|$|So, {{the unfortunate}} Mike very humbly withdrew, and Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick {{appeared}} to have re-established their good understanding, {{and went to work}} again with an air of refreshment upon them as if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> lunch.|$|R

5000|$|Casting Arnold Schwarzenegger as our Terminator, on {{the other}} hand, shouldn't have worked. The guy is {{supposed}} to be an infiltration unit, and there's no way you wouldn't spot a Terminator in a crowd instantly if they all looked like Arnold. It made no sense whatsoever. But the beauty of movies is that they don't have to be logical. <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to have plausibility. If there's a visceral, cinematic thing happening that the audience likes, they don't care if it goes against what's likely. —James Cameron on casting Schwarzenegger.|$|R
60|$|On the smooth, mossy log {{was a great}} pile of shining yellow corn. There {{was another}} pile of plump ripe acorns, and three little piles of dainty looking brown seeds. But the thing that Happy Jack couldn't keep his eyes off {{was right in the}} middle. It was a huge pile of big, fat hickory nuts. Now who could remain ill-tempered and cross with such a lot of goodies spread before him? Certainly not Happy Jack or his cousin, Chatterer the Red Squirrel. <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> to smile in spite of themselves, and when Striped Chipmunk urged them to sit down and help themselves, they did. In three minutes they were so busy eating that they had {{forgotten}} all about their quarrel and were laughing and chatting like the best of friends.|$|E
60|$|So {{every one}} who heard Tommy Tit's cheery voice that cold winter morning {{just had to}} smile. Yes, Sir, <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> to smile, even Sammy Jay and Blacky the Crow. They just couldn't help themselves. When Tommy reached the stone wall that {{separated}} the Old Orchard from Farmer Brown's dooryard, his sharp eyes were not long in finding Peter Rabbit, and Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel, and Chatterer hiding in the old wall where they could peep out and see all that happened in Farmer Brown's dooryard. Looking back through the Old Orchard, he saw {{what looked like a}} little bit of the blue, blue sky flitting silently from tree to tree. It was Sammy Jay. Over in the very top of a tall maple-tree, a long way off, was a spot of black. Tommy didn't need to be told that it was Blacky the Crow, who didn't dare come any nearer.|$|E
60|$|Granny Fox and Reddy {{were out}} too. They didn't need to hurry because, as you know, they could hunt all night, {{but they were}} so hungry that <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> {{to be looking for}} {{something}} to eat. They knew, of course, that everybody else would be out, and they hoped that some of these little people would be so weak that they could easily be caught. That seems like a dreadful hope, doesn't it? But one of the first laws of Old Mother Nature is self-preservation. That means to save your own life first. So perhaps Granny and Reddy are not to be blamed for hoping that some of their neighbors might be caught easily because of the great storm. They were very hungry indeed, and they could not eat bark like Peter Rabbit, or buds like Mrs. Grouse, or seeds like Whitefoot the Woodmouse. Their teeth and stomachs are not made for such food.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{central theme}} {{of the book is}} that the Vodou {{religion}} connects people to a loyal force of love. According to Mama Lola, [...] "Poor people don't have no true love. <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> affiliation" [...] (166). Vodou religion was the end of Mama Lola's involvement in sexual givings, and the beginning of when, according to Brown, the Spirits embodied the qualities of [...] "ideal lovers" [...] (167).|$|R
