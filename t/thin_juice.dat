50|$|The <b>thin</b> <b>juice</b> is {{concentrated}} via multiple-effect evaporation {{to make a}} thick juice, roughly 60% sucrose by weight and similar in appearance to pancake syrup. Thick juice {{can be stored in}} tanks for later processing, reducing the load on the crystallization plant.|$|E
50|$|Next, {{carbon dioxide}} is bubbled through the {{alkaline}} sugar solution, precipitating the lime as calcium carbonate (chalk). The chalk particles entrap some impurities and absorb others. A recycling process builds up the size of chalk particles and a natural flocculation occurs where the heavy particles settle out in tanks (clarifiers). A final addition of more carbon dioxide precipitates more calcium from solution; this is filtered off, leaving a cleaner, golden light-brown sugar solution called <b>thin</b> <b>juice.</b>|$|E

Instead of letting the sailors file their teeth against the rim of a hard sea-biscuit, they baked their bread daily in pitiful little rolls. Then they had no [...] "grog"; as a substitute, they drugged the poor fellows with a <b>thin,</b> sour wine--the <b>juice</b> of a few grapes, perhaps, to a pint of the juice of water-faucets.

40|$|The use of {{biofuels}} as {{an alternative}} to fossil fuels has expanded in the last few decades. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the application of different strains and forms of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for raw, <b>thin</b> and thick <b>juice</b> fermentation in order to produce bioethanol. According to the obtained results the strain applied in the form of pressed blocks with 70 % w/w moisture, attained higher value of the specific growth rate and lower value of ethanol yield in comparison with strains applied in dried form. In all culture media attained efficiency of sugar utilization was at least from 98 - 99 % w/w. Maximum productivity was achieved around 30 th hour of fermentation and amounted ≈ 1. 8 g l- 1 h- 1 for all applied yeast strains. Therefore, optimal duration of the process in technical and economic terms should be considered...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{ascertain}} the normal relation of swallowing apnea (SA) onset relative to lingual bolus propulsion along with factors that may alter this relation. Forty adults, composed of ten males and ten females in each of two age groups (i. e., 20 - 30 and 63 - 79 years) participated. SA onset was assessed during 5 - and 20 -ml bolus volumes of water and apple juice across three trials. The effects of age, gender, bolus volume, bolus viscosity, and gustation on SA onset relative to lingual bolus propulsion were examined. A significant interaction of age by gender by volume was found. In general, older adults initiated SA onset earlier than young adults and large boluses elicited an earlier SA onset than small boluses regardless of group. Young males demonstrated significantly later SA onset than the older males for large volumes, this difference was not observed for small volumes nor was it found between young and older females. SA onset also was assessed during 5 -ml bolus volumes of <b>thin</b> apple <b>juice,</b> thick apple juice, and applesauce across three trials. A significant main effect of viscosity was found revealing that SA onset was initiated later as bolus viscosity increased. Thus, the results of this investigation provided data on the relation of SA onset relative to lingual bolus propulsion in individuals with normal swallowing and how this relation changes as a function of age, gender, bolus volume, bolus viscosity, and gustation...|$|R
50|$|The {{target is}} a large {{particle}} that naturally settles rapidly to leave a clear juice. The juice at the end is approximately 15 °Bx and 90% sucrose. The pH of the <b>thin</b> <b>juice</b> produced is a balance between removing as much calcium from the solution and the expected pH drop across later processing. If the juice goes acidic in the crystallisation stages then sucrose rapidly breaks down to glucose and fructose; not only do glucose and fructose affect crystallisation but they are molassagenic taking equivalent amounts of sucrose on to the molasses stage.|$|E
5000|$|Some flowers can {{be found}} on the puriri all year round, though it does flower most heavily over winter. Ripe fruit can also be found all year round, but is more common over the summer. Puriri is a very {{important}} tree for native birds in the top half of the North Island because it provides a constant year-round food supply. Flowers and fruit are carried at the tips of the branches.The fruit or drupe is a bright red (usually) to a pale yellow (rarely, and only on white flowered trees) [...] "cherry". It can grow as big as a cherry, but it is unpleasantly astringent. When broken, the fruit has a bright <b>thin</b> <b>juice,</b> and a faint grape smell. Puriri fruit is not the most nutritious sort in the New Zealand bush (high in carbohydrates, not lipids, sugars or calcium), but it is always there. The nut (endocarp) inside the drupe is a very hard pear-shaped kernel that can contain up to 4 seeds. The seedlings from one kernel can germinate at the same time or be spread over a year. The nut has four apertures in the endocarp each guarded by an oval door and each leading to a seed chamber. The Puriri is self-fertile with self fertilization (autogamy) possible. Seed production in 12 samples ranged from 8% to 45% with usually only 1 or 2 live seeds in a fruit. Low seed production is due to inefficiencies in pollination, as well as breakdown of apparently fully developed seeds. The factors controlling germination and opening of the doors are unknown, and most seed would appear to perish within the Imprisoning nut.|$|E

Recent reports also demonstrate that fractal distribution principles are very useful in ion exchange softener applications – significantly reducing resin requirements and allowing <b>thin</b> <b>juice</b> exhaustion flowrates as high as 500 BV/hr.

40|$|We have {{characterized}} a novel small {{heat shock}} protein gene, viscosity 1 (vis 1) from tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and provide evidence that it {{plays a role in}} pectin depolymerization and juice viscosity in ripening fruits. Expression of vis 1 is negatively associated with juice viscosity in diverse tomato genotypes. vis 1 exhibits DNA polymorphism among tomato genotypes, and the alleles vis 1 -hta (high-transcript accumulator; accession no. AY 128101) and vis 1 -lta (low transcript accumulator; accession no. AY 128102) are associated with <b>thinner</b> and thicker <b>juice,</b> respectively. Segregation of tomato lines heterogeneous for vis 1 alleles indicates that vis 1 influences pectin depolymerization and juice viscosity in ripening fruits. vis 1 is regulated by fruit ripening and high temperature and exhibits a typical {{heat shock protein}} chaperone function when expressed in bacterial cells. We propose that VIS 1 contributes to physiochemical properties of juice, including pectin depolymerization, by reducing thermal denaturation of depolymerizing enzymes during daytime elevated temperatures...|$|R
40|$|New technologies, {{such as an}} {{efficient}} vapor-compression evaporator, a stationary lime kiln (SLK), and the MixAlco process, compelled us to re-evaluate methods for producing sugar from cane. These technologies allow more water and lime to be used, and they add more value to bagasse. Extracting and preserving the sugars, and lime pretreating the bagasse to enhance biodigestibility, {{all at the same}} time in a pile, was demonstrated to be unfeasible; therefore, sugar extraction must occur before lime treating the bagasse. Sugar extraction should occur countercurrently by lixiviation, where liquid moves in stages opposite to the soaked bagasse (megasse), which is conveyed by screw-press conveyors that gently squeeze the fiber in each stage, improving extraction. The performance of a pilot-scale screw-press conveyor was tested for dewatering capabilities and power consumption. The unoptimized equipment decreased megasse moisture from 96 to 89 %. Simulation of the process suggested that eight stages are necessary to achieve 98 % recovery from typical sugarcane. The cumulative power for the screw-press conveyor system was 17. 0 ? 2. 1 hp?h/ton dry fiber. <b>Thin</b> raw <b>juice</b> preserved with lime for several months showed no sucrose degradation and no quality deterioration, except for reducing sugar destruction. The lime loading needed for 1 -year preservation is 0. 20 g Ca(OH) 2 /g sucrose. Shorter times require less lime. After preservation, the juice was carbonated and filtered, and the resulting sludge pelletized. Due to their high organic content, the pellets were too weak for calcination temperatures used in the SLK. The organics must be decreased prior to pelletization and sodium must be supplemented as a binding agent. Long-term lime pretreatment of bagasse showed two delignification phases: bulk (rapid) and residual (slow). These were modeled by two simultaneous first-order reactions. Treatments with air purging and higher temperatures (50 ? 57 oC) delignified more effectively, especially during the residual phase, thus yielding higher cellulase-enzyme digestibilities after 2 ? 8 weeks of treatment. At temperatures > 60 oC, pure oxygen purging is preferred. Fresh bagasse was of better quality than old bagasse. Treatment with NaOH yielded a larger bulk delignification phase than Ca(OH) 2. Long-term lime pulping of bagasse was unsuitable for copy-quality paper, but it was appropriate for strawboard and other filler applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{philosophy}} {{of our research}} is built on the behaviour of non-sugar compounds from biomass during ethanolic fermentation. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, industrially used to bioconvert sugar into ethanol under anaerobic conditions, assimilates some compounds present in the fermentable juice (proteins, amino acids, [...] .). But others compounds are not used by the yeast. They leave in the vinasse after ethanol distillation and are thus concentrated by the process. Our purpose is to discuss the behaviour of betaine, saponins and raffinose in sugar juices (raw juice, <b>thin</b> <b>juice,</b> thick juice) and in vinasse after ethanolic fermentation. An attention {{will be given to}} some high added value products (like betaine) and the potentialities to use fermentation as a tool of purification in white chemistry...|$|E

The purpose of these structures is to eliminate the uncontrollable geometry associated with the scaling and distribution of fluids. Because of the ubiquity of turbulence, {{a large number of}} applications are envisioned. Present applications include rapid low turbulent mixing, controlled formation of specified fluid geometry and low energy fluid distribution. Practically any fluid handling step is a candidate for the use of fractals. “Fractalization” of an overall fluid process can lead to a number of benefits. A single factory at Amalgamated Sugar LLC has so far implemented fractals for distributing fluid in the molasses chromatography process, for controlling exhaustion/regeneration in <b>thin</b> <b>juice</b> ion exchange and for providing uniform air circulation in a sugar silo.

40|$|Although {{significant}} {{progress has been}} made in characterizing various components of fruit ripening process, the molecular mechanisms regulating fruit texture and other attributes remain poorly understood. Using fruit juice viscosity as an indicator of cell wall solubilization and depolymerization, I tested the possibility of isolating novel genes that affect fruit quality attributes. Characterization of genes differentially expressed in thick- and <b>thin</b> <b>juice</b> tomato genotypes resulted in isolation and characterization of a small heat shock gene, designated as vis 1 (viscosity 12 ̆ 6 barbelow;). My results show that vis 1 transcript accumulation is negatively correlated with tomato juice thickness in different genotypes. Two alleles of vis 1 exhibit genomic DNA polymorphism. Vis 1 -hta (vis 1 -high t 2 ̆ 6 barbelow;ranscript a 2 ̆ 6 barbelow;ccumulator) and vis 1 -lta (vis 1 - 1 ow t 2 ̆ 6 barbelow;ranscript a 2 ̆ 6 barbelow;ccumulator) are associated with high and low vis 1 transcript accumulation, and low and high juice viscosity respectively, in diverse genotypes and in segregating progenies of lines heterogeneous for vis 1 alleles. Vis 1 expression is enhanced by elevated temperature and fruit ripening, and it exhibits typical chaperone activity when expressed in E. coli. Transgenic tomato plants over- and under-expressing vis 1 were created to determine its role in plant growth and developmental processes, including fruit ripening. Contrary to what was expected from above studies, transgenic fruit over-expressing vis 1 yielded significantly thicker juice than wild type fruit, while impaired expression of vis 1 reduced juice viscosity. In addition, fruit with impaired expression of vis 1 ripened earlier, had less average fruit weight. These results have provided the first genetic evidence for a stress protein regulating fruit ripening and fruit quality. To determine if expression of other classes of heat shock proteins (Hsps) is also regulated during fruit ripening, I have examined the diurnal expression of diverse heat shock genes, including members of different classes of sHsps, three Hsp 70 s, an Hsp 90, and an Hsp 100 in tomato fruit under the field conditions at a wide range of temperatures. I show herein that expression of most classes of Hsps is increased by the daytime increase in temperature under field conditions. However, transcripts accumulated more rapidly in ripening fruit than in green fruit. These results suggest that heat perception increases with fruit ripening. I propose that Hsps, including Vis 1 protein, play significant roles in fruit ripening process by protecting fruit from environmental and ripening associated stresses. ...|$|E
