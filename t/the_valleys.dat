5|$|Due to the {{geological}} {{layout of the}} Rhondda Valley, transport links are fairly restrictive. The original road layout followed <b>the</b> <b>valleys</b> with few connections between them. In the 1920s, a major unemployment relief programme for out of work miners was created to build mountain roads connecting communities together. The mountain roads had a lasting effect and transformed <b>the</b> <b>valleys</b> from being dead-end communities. In the late 20th and early 21st century, new road projects such as the Rhondda by-pass have been created out of former railway lines.|$|E
5|$|In the pre-Columbian era, the {{location}} {{of what is now}} the city of Lima was inhabited by several Amerindian groups. Prior to the arrival of the Inca Empire, <b>the</b> <b>valleys</b> of the Rímac and Lurín rivers were grouped under the Ichma polity. Their presence left a mark in the form of some 40 pyramids associated to the irrigation system of <b>the</b> <b>valleys.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Wine: The most {{well-known}} wine {{of the region}} is the Côtes de Toul. There are vineyards in <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> of <b>the</b> Moselle, <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> of Seille, <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> of Metz, and <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> of Sierck.|$|R
50|$|Using {{the limits}} as {{described}} by Christian Leblanc, <b>the</b> <b>Valley</b> of <b>the</b> Queens consists of the main wadi which contains most of the tombs, as well as <b>the</b> <b>Valley</b> of Prince Ahmose, <b>the</b> <b>Valley</b> of <b>the</b> Rope, <b>the</b> <b>Valley</b> of <b>the</b> Three Pits, and <b>the</b> <b>Valley</b> of <b>the</b> Dolmen.

5|$|Being {{the highest}} {{tropical}} cordillera in the world, the Cordillera Blanca boasts {{a variety of}} ecosystems, from humid tropical through subalpine to alpine and tundra. <b>The</b> <b>valleys</b> and mountain slopes are covered with scattered high Andean forests and puna grassland.|$|E
5|$|Brahmins {{constitute}} 4 {{percent of}} the population of Maharashtra, and 60 {{percent of the}}m are Deshastha Brahmins. <b>The</b> <b>valleys</b> of the Krishna and the Godavari rivers, and the plateaus of the Sahyadri hills, are collectively called the Desha – the original home of the Deshastha Brahmins.|$|E
5|$|The Peshwa's {{territory}} {{was in an}} {{area called}} the Desha, {{now part of the}} modern state of Maharashtra. The region consists of <b>the</b> <b>valleys</b> of the Krishna and Godavari rivers and the plateaus of the Sahyadri Mountains. Shinde's territory around Gwalior and Bundelkhand was a region of rolling hills and fertile valleys that slopes down toward the Indo-Gangetic Plain to the north. The Pindari territory was <b>the</b> <b>valleys</b> and forests of the Chambal, the north western region of the modern state of Madhya Pradesh. It was a mountainous region with a harsh climate. The Pindaris also operated from Malwa, a plateau region in the north west of the state of Madhya Pradesh, north of the Vindhya Range. Holkar was based in the upper Narmada River valley.|$|E
50|$|As part of {{the events}} that {{ultimately}} {{led to the creation of}} the Basin and Range Province, during the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene, basalt was extruded in <b>the</b> Lake <b>Valley</b> region as <b>the</b> surrounding mountains were lifted and <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> floor dropped. Due to the lack of natural drainage in <b>the</b> <b>valley,</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> periodically filled with water, transforming <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> into pluvial Lake Meinzer, which peaked at a maximum depth of 250 feet over <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> floor. Much of <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> is filled with deposits from the former lake.|$|R
50|$|The lake Oldevatnet lies in {{the center}} of <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> for most of the length of <b>the</b> <b>valley.</b> At <b>the</b> north end of <b>the</b> <b>valley,</b> <b>the</b> lake empties into the river Oldeelva, which flows into the Nordfjorden. Both the Olden Church and the {{historic}} Old Olden Church are located near the north end of <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> and <b>the</b> Ljosheim Chapel lies {{at the southern end of}} <b>the</b> <b>valley.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>valley</b> runs north through Oppdal, {{and then}} at the {{mountain}} Allmannberget, <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> turns west and heads to neighboring Sunndal, where it is known as <b>the</b> Sunndalen <b>valley.</b> <b>The</b> Dovrefjell-Sunndalsfjella National Park lies southwest and east of <b>the</b> <b>valley.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{geological}} features {{near the}} headwaters of Catawissa Creek primarily include anthracite and ridges of sandstone. <b>The</b> <b>valleys</b> {{in this part of}} the watershed are narrow and steep. Elsewhere in the watershed, the topography consists mostly of less steep valleys and some hills.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{ceramics}} on the Altiplano {{started in the}} Herrera Period, with the oldest evidences of ceramic use dated at 3000 BP. The many different clays of the rivers and lakes of <b>the</b> <b>valleys</b> on the high plateau made a variety of ceramic types possible.|$|E
5|$|When {{continental}} glaciers {{moved over}} the Rove Formation area, the ice was a hundreds of meters thick and its surface sloped gently southward from the Patrician center to the north. The {{base of the}} ice sheet encountered the cuesta topography relief {{of a few hundred}} feet. Because the ice over <b>the</b> <b>valleys</b> would be thicker than the ice over the ridges, obstructed extrusion flow would operate and resulted in the removal of the easily quarried slates of <b>the</b> <b>valleys.</b> The ridges would not be appreciably eroded, partly because the ice would be thinner over the ridges and therefore less plastic, and partly because of the resistance of the diabase to both quarrying and abrasion by the ice.|$|E
50|$|Wairau <b>Valley</b> is <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> of <b>the</b> Wairau River in Marlborough, New Zealand {{and also}} {{the name of the}} main {{settlement}} in <b>the</b> upper <b>valley.</b> State Highway 63 runs through <b>the</b> <b>valley.</b> <b>The</b> <b>valley</b> opens onto <b>the</b> Wairau Plain, where Renwick and Blenheim are sited. The Alpine-Wairau Fault runs along the length of <b>the</b> <b>valley.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1768 <b>the</b> <b>Valley</b> River {{became part}} of Tryon County, North Carolina. In 1779 <b>the</b> <b>Valley</b> River {{became part of}} Rutherford County, North Carolina. In 1791 <b>the</b> <b>Valley</b> River {{became a part of}} Buncombe County, North Carolina. In 1808 Haywood County, North Carolina, which was to contain <b>the</b> <b>Valley</b> River, was carved from Buncombe County. In 1828, Macon County, North Carolina which was to contain <b>the</b> <b>Valley</b> River was carved from Haywood County. Until 1835, the lands around <b>the</b> <b>Valley</b> River all belonged to the Cherokee.|$|R
30|$|The primary {{direction}} of groundwater flow in <b>the</b> Salmon River <b>Valley</b> is {{from north to}} south, following <b>the</b> <b>valley’s</b> elongate orientation. However, {{there is also a}} component of flow from <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> margins toward <b>the</b> center of <b>the</b> <b>valley.</b> Although <b>the</b> <b>valley’s</b> fill thickness beneath the field site is unknown, it was possible to make an approximate thickness estimate of 50 – 60  m by creating a topographic profile of <b>the</b> <b>valley.</b>|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of playing fields in <b>the</b> <b>valleys,</b> many rugby teams would share grounds, travel every week to away grounds or even play on {{inappropriate}} (e.g. sloping) pitches. The valley clubs also had no clubhouses, with most teams meeting, and changing, in the closest local public house. Many more clubs, built around colliery and pub teams, appeared and disbanded but many of the clubs survive to this day.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of inhabitants in the Rhondda prior to industrialisation, there are few residents of note before <b>the</b> <b>valleys</b> became a coal mining area. The earliest individuals {{to come to the}} fore were linked with the coal industry and the people; physical men who found {{a way out of the}} Rhondda through sport; charismatic orators who led the miners through unions or political and religious leaders who tended to the deeply religious chapel going public.|$|E
5|$|Erosion acting upon {{different}} types of uplift-created joint and fracture systems is responsible for creating <b>the</b> <b>valleys,</b> canyons, domes, and other features we see today. These joints and fracture systems do not move, and are therefore not faults. Spacing between joints {{is controlled by the}} amount of silica in the granite and granodiorite rocks; more silica tends to create a more resistant rock, resulting in larger spaces between joints and fractures.|$|E
50|$|Three {{sides of}} <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> are bordered by {{mountains}} that rise several thousand feet above <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> floor. On <b>the</b> east side, the Warner Mountains run {{the entire length}} of <b>the</b> <b>valley,</b> while <b>the</b> Fremont Mountains border <b>the</b> <b>valley's</b> north and west sides. At the northern end of <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> between <b>the</b> two mountain ranges is a low pass connecting <b>the</b> Goose Lake <b>Valley</b> with <b>the</b> Crooked Creek <b>Valley,</b> a small basin-and-range valley that leads to the south shore of Abert Lake. South and southwest of <b>the</b> Goose Lake <b>Valley</b> is <b>the</b> Modoc Plateau. Crane Mountain, in the Warner Mountains, is the highest point overlooking <b>the</b> <b>valley.</b> <b>The</b> summit of Crane Mountain is 8456 ft above sea level.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>valley</b> is {{passable}} by mules, {{although the}} descent into <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> {{is impossible for}} camels to pass. There are two villages in the valley: Anjuman and Anjuman-i-Khurd. They are both situated some eighteen miles {{from the mouth of}} <b>the</b> <b>valley.</b> Another village, Scarsap, is situated in a branch valley about 14 miles from the mouth of <b>the</b> Anjuman <b>valley.</b> <b>The</b> grazing in <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> is good.|$|R
5000|$|Sassendalen is {{a valley}} at Spitsbergen, Svalbard. <b>The</b> <b>valley</b> is among <b>the</b> largest <b>valleys</b> of Svalbard, and {{continues}} westwards into Sassenfjorden.

5|$|It {{has been}} well {{documented}} in sources in Egypt and Sudan. In 1866 the Pharmaceutical Journal stated that it was found as a contaminant in Alexandrian senna, being found in cultivated fields in <b>the</b> <b>valleys</b> to the east and south of Assouan, in the Elephantine Islands, opposite Assouan, along the Nile, and Edfou and Hermonthis. In Israel it grows in the Judean desert, the Dead Sea Valley, the Negev hills and Eilat.|$|E
5|$|John Eves likely {{settled in}} the valley of Little Fishing Creek before 1774 and {{possibly}} as early as 1769. In 1778, Moses Van Campen led a scouting part past from Fort Wheeler to Chillisquaque Creek via Little Fishing Creek. The headwaters of Little Fishing Creek were uninhabited considerably after <b>the</b> <b>valleys</b> of Greenwood and Jerseytown were inhabited.|$|E
5|$|Legend has it {{that the}} Cailleach was tired from a long day herding deer. Atop Ben Cruachan she fell asleep on her watch and a well she was tending overflowed, running down from the {{highlands}} and flooding <b>the</b> <b>valleys</b> below, forming first a river and then the loch. The overflowing well is a common motif in local Gaelic creation tales - as seen in the goddess Boann's similar creation of the River Boyne in Ireland. Other connections to the region include her above-mentioned strong ties with the fierce whirlpool in the Gulf of Corryvreckan.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Warner <b>Valley</b> {{is located}} in south-central Oregon. It is {{approximately}} 60 mi long and 8 mi wide. Most of <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> is in Lake County; however, {{the north end of}} <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> extends about 10 mi into Harney County. <b>The</b> <b>valley</b> has two regions commonly referred to as <b>the</b> South Warner <b>Valley</b> and <b>the</b> North Warner <b>Valley.</b> <b>The</b> two areas transition between Crump Lake and Hart Lake at a point where <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> narrows to about 5 mi in width.|$|R
50|$|In {{the east}} of <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> is <b>the</b> Tormik <b>valley</b> and in <b>the</b> west is <b>the</b> Stak <b>valley</b> and Askor <b>Valley.</b> In <b>the</b> south, there is <b>the</b> Mandi <b>valley</b> and in <b>the</b> north, there is a mountainous region which {{ultimately}} links <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> to <b>the</b> upper <b>valleys</b> of Stak and Tormik.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{dedicated}} to Saint Anthony the Great. It is commonly called Qozhaya, in reference to <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> {{in which it is}} located. <b>The</b> <b>valley</b> of Qozhaya, along with <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> of Qannoubine (قنوبين) to which it is connected to the west, form what is called <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> of Qadisha [...]|$|R
5|$|Llullaillaco {{appears to}} have been the most {{important}} Inca sacred mountain in the region. Archeological sites are also found in <b>the</b> <b>valleys</b> that drain Llullaillaco towards the Salar de Punta Negra, including the Quebrada Llullaillaco and the Quebrada de las Zorritas. The paths connect with the major north-south axis that runs between San Pedro de Atacama and Copiapo. This axis is associated with the extensive Inca road system.|$|E
5|$|Several {{parallel}} {{ranges of}} hills dominate {{the interior of}} the Catlins, separated by <b>the</b> <b>valleys</b> of the Owaka, Catlins and Tahakopa Rivers, which all drain southeastwards into the Pacific Ocean. The most notable of these ranges is the Maclennan Range. Between them, these hills are often simply referred to as the Catlins Ranges. Their northwestern slopes are drained by several tributaries of the Clutha and Mataura Rivers, most notably the Mokoreta River, which flows mainly westwards, reaching the Mataura close to the town of Wyndham.|$|E
5|$|Social {{amenities}} were rudimentary {{even before}} {{the formation of the}} Rhondda Urban District Council in 1897. Due to the geographic layout of <b>the</b> <b>valleys,</b> land was a scarce resource, and therefore leisure activities that took up little space, time and money were sought. This saw the popularity of activities such as greyhound races, cockfighting, open air handball courts (often attached to a public house), boxing booths, foot racing and rugby union.|$|E
