40|$|Title of the work: Children's {{experience}} {{of living in}} the <b>Reception</b> <b>Centre</b> Strakonice My thesis is focussed on the influence of the environment on an individual; it concentrates on the influence of the environment on children living in the <b>Reception</b> <b>Centre</b> in Strakonice in particular. Key concepts and problems relating to the theme of the thesis are defined and described in the theoretical part of the thesis. At first, the service of <b>reception</b> <b>centres</b> is characterised, than the <b>Reception</b> <b>Centre</b> in Strakonice is described. The other themes deal with obstacles and needs of single development periods during the childhood and with the influence of the environment on the development of an individual above all. At the beginning of the practical part of the thesis, the chosen goal of the thesis and research questions are described. The goal of the thesis is to find out how the stay in the <b>Reception</b> <b>Centre</b> in Strakonice is viewed by the children living in this facility. The asked research questions base on this goal. It was analysed whether the children feel stigmatised, whether they can view this facility as their home, how they view their living in the <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> generally. To find answers to the asked questions and to achieve the goal of the thesis, the qualitative strategy of the research, the technique of half-structured dialogues combined with observing was chosen. The basic goal group was represented by the children living in the <b>Reception</b> <b>Centre</b> in Strakonice. It was a group of seven children specifically. The goal group included children of the age from four to fifteen years. The supplementary group was represented by their parents. The results of the research can show that the living in the <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> is viewed as stigmatising by child clients subjectively. If they view the <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> as their home, it is given with the long-term nature of their living here, with getting used to it, and with enough friends in the <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> or its near surrounding. The children dislike the environment of the not- renovated old building and broken things in it. They like the society of other children...|$|R

50|$|By {{the mid-1970s}} {{the number of}} {{children}} placed at Allambie reached an all-time high. Overcrowding decreased as alternative reception and care programs were implemented by the Department. During the 1970s, changes in the structure of state-run facilities, including regionalisation of services, reduced the need for large-scale centralised <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> like Allambie. By the early 1980s, Allambie accommodated about 100 children. A review in 1985 recommended the closure of Allambie, and the redirection of funding to regional <b>reception</b> <b>centres.</b> The nursery at Allambie closed in 1986.
