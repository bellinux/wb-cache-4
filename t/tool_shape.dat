50|$|Scrapers are {{typically}} formed by chipping {{the end of}} a flake of stone in order to create one sharp side and to keep the rest of the sides dull to facilitate grasping it. Most scrapers are either circle or blade-like in shape. The working edges of scrapers tend to be convex, and many have trimmed and dulled lateral edges to facilitate hafting. One important variety of scraper is the thumbnail scraper, a scraper shaped much like its namesake. This scraper type is common at Paleo-Indian sites in North America. Scrapers {{are one of the most}} varied lithic tools found at archaeological sites. Due to the vast array of scrapers there are many typologies that scrapers can fall under, including tool size, <b>tool</b> <b>shape,</b> tool base, the number of working edges, edge angle, edge shape, and many more.|$|E
5000|$|In {{archaeology}} a flake tool {{is a type}} {{of stone}} tool that was used during the Stone Age that was created by striking a flake from a prepared stone core. People during prehistoric times often preferred these flake tools as compared to other tools because these tools were often easily made, could be made to be extremely sharp and could easily be repaired. Flake tools could be sharpened by retouch to create scrapers or burins. These tools were either made by flaking off small particles of flint or by breaking off a large piece and using that as a tool itself. These tools were able to be made by this [...] "chipping" [...] away effect due to the natural characteristic of stone. Stone is able to break apart when struck near the edge.

A brief review of some ethnographic and archaeological studies confirms the long standing proposition that stone <b>tool</b> <b>shape</b> does not always correlate to the particular function and that some stone tool shapes may have been effective for multiple functions. It is shown that processes such as tool production and tool use as well as situational constraints encountered by tool makers are responsible {{for much of the}} variability in stone <b>tool</b> <b>shape</b> and that these processes and constraints should be accounted for when building stone tool typologies.

40|$|Abstract — Springback {{is a very}} {{important}} factor to influence the quality of sheet metal forming. Accurate prediction and controlling of springback is essential for the design of tools for sheet metal forming. Several approaches have been proposed for springback compensation by modification of the <b>tooling</b> <b>shape.</b> These approaches are iterative finite element methods. In this paper an analytical approach is presented for one step modification of the <b>tooling</b> <b>shape</b> in channel forming process to compensate the springback error. With the help of this approach, the optimum die shape for producing the target shape can be obtained in a few seconds. The algorithm of springback compensation by inverse FE modelling is also presented. The results of the analytical approach coincide with those of FE approach. The accuracy of the obtained results is verified by the experimental results and high precision is achieved...|$|R

Furthermore mechanical properties were also found to improve as the rotary speed increases and the same phenomenon was found to happen while using straight cylindrical threaded pin profile tool. The microstructure of the dissimilar joints revealed that at low welding speeds, the improved material mixing was observed. The similar phenomenon was found to happen at higher rotational speeds using straight cylindrical threaded tool...|$|E

Tools influence {{the way we}} think and behave, "we become what we behold" ([McLuhan, 1994], p. 19). We extend ourselves through the tools we use but inevitably we also lose something in the process. For example, the invention of the automobile has greatly extended our mobility but it has also changed village life and led to pollution. In medicine, an over-reliance on diagnostic tests has been blamed for a loss of basic clinical skills ([Bordage, 1995]) and in nursing, an overextension of the scientific may lead to a diminishment of the humanistic.

The objective {{of this paper is to}} study the influence of process parameters and electrode shape configuration on the machining characteristics such as surface quality, material removal rate and electrode wear. This review is based on various study carried on this field by various researchers. In this study we found better machining performance is obtained generally with the electrode as the cathode and the work-piece as an anode. In this review we observe that for high MRR main process parameters are peak current, pulse on time,pulse off time, whereas for electrode wear are mainly influenced by peak current and pulse on time. Surface quality is mainly influenced by peak current. As far as <b>tool</b> <b>shape</b> configuration concerned best <b>tool</b> <b>shape</b> for higher MRR and lower TWR is circular, followed by square, triangular, rectangular, and diamond cross sections...|$|E
