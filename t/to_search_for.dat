Realizing that PBFs are a more important part of the diet in many non-US countries, we will analyze the country of authors for articles in PubMed on PBFs. To determine whether some countries have more emphasis on PBF research than others, we will use a hedge that we have developed <b>to</b> <b>search</b> in PubMed <b>for</b> PBFs. We will combine this with a <b>search</b> <b>for</b> the country of the authors.
