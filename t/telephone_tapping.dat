25|$|However Newsam's {{intervention}} in another matter was less successful: in late 1956 Home Secretary Gwilym Lloyd George accepted Newsam's advice and authorised the <b>telephone</b> <b>tapping</b> of Billy Hill, a known criminal. At the time gang warfare {{had broken out}} in London between Hill and rival gangster Jack Spot. The Bar council approached the police and requested the tapes {{in order to provide}} evidence for an investigation into the professional conduct of Hill's barrister, Patrick Marrinan.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} his contract, Shields {{announced}} that he would establish his own company, Shields Crime and Security Consultants. He supported Owen Ellington's bid to succeed his former boss Rear Admiral Hardley Lewin as Police Commissioner. Through his consultancy work, he would encourage Caribbean law enforcement agencies to adopt advanced technology and forensic techniques such as DNA profiling and <b>telephone</b> <b>tapping</b> on mobile phones. However, he acknowledged that there were significant barriers to implementing these techniques, such as the atmosphere of mistrust between the policing and the telecommunications sectors in Jamaica.|$|E
25|$|In 1983 a Fine Gaelâ€“Labour Party {{coalition}} government took office and its Minister for Justice, Michael Noonan, revealed that Haughey's government {{had been involved}} in the tapping of certain journalists' telephones. This set off another leadership struggle, with O'Malley, Gerry Collins, Michael O'Kennedy, Brian Lenihan and John P. Wilson all showing an interest in replacing Haughey. However, an official inquiry into the <b>telephone</b> <b>tapping</b> cleared Haughey of any wrongdoing and put more blame on Martin O'Donoghue than the other TDs involved. Haughey retained the leadership by 40 votes to 33.|$|E
50|$|A {{distinction}} {{here has}} to be made however on the type of surveillance employed. Some people that say support video surveillance in city streets may not support indiscriminate <b>telephone</b> <b>taps</b> and vice versa.

25|$|Hoover {{began using}} {{wiretapping}} in the 1920s during Prohibition to arrest bootleggers. In the 1927 case Olmstead v. United States, {{in which a}} bootlegger was caught through <b>telephone</b> <b>tapping,</b> the United States Supreme Court ruled that FBI wiretaps did not violate the Fourth Amendment as unlawful search and seizure, {{as long as the}} FBI did not break into a person's home to complete the tapping. After Prohibition's repeal, Congress passed the Communications Act of 1934, which outlawed non-consensual phone tapping, but did allow bugging. In the 1939 case Nardone v. United States, the court ruled that due to the 1934 law, evidence the FBI obtained by phone tapping was inadmissible in court. After the 1967 case Katz v. United States overturned the 1927 case that had allowed bugging, Congress passed the Omnibus Crime Control Act, allowing public authorities to tap telephones during investigations, as long as they obtained warrants beforehand.|$|E

On 9 December, a letter arrived from the Prime Minister offering him a peerage. He accepted, and his name appeared in the New Year Honours list, and was created Baron Birkett, of Ulverston in the County of Lancaster, and took his seat in the House of Lords on 20 February 1958. In the same year, he was awarded a LLD by the University of Cambridge, where the speaker said that Birkett was [...] "endowed with such a voice as Cicero declared to be first requisite of an orator" [...] and that [...] "in our own time {{there had been no}} one more skilled in swaying the mind of a jury." [...] In February 1959, he appeared on the first episode of the BBC television program Face to Face, where he was described as [...] "one of the three or four greatest criminal lawyers of this century, and perhaps one of the three or four greatest criminal lawyers of all time". Outside politics and the law, he also served as Master of the Worshipful Company of Curriers four times.|$|E

He was accused of giving police a free hand to fight corruption as part of his anti-corruption drive {{to the point where they}} could mistreat suspects. Under his administration, the prison population soared, and the judiciary allegedly became more harsh. It was described [...] "an extremely punitive and abusive criminal justice, law-and-order system, which ended up with the highest per capita prison population in Europe -- even higher than in Russia -- in which torture became absolutely routine... Almost zero acquittal cases in criminal trials, mass surveillance, <b>telephone</b> <b>tapping,</b> and a lot of pressure put on businessmen, including intimidation, so they contribute to government projects." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Greek {{wiretapping}} case of 2004-05, {{also referred}} to as Greek Watergate, involved the illegal <b>telephone</b> <b>tapping</b> of more than 100mobile phones on the Vodafone Greece network belonging mostly to members of the Greek government and top-ranking civil servants. The taps began sometime near the beginning of August 2004 and were removed in March 2005 without discovering the identity of the perpetrators. The intruders installed a rootkit targeting Ericsson's AXE telephone exchange. According to IEEE Spectrum, this was [...] "the first time a rootkit has been observed on a special-purpose system, in this case an Ericsson telephone switch." [...] The rootkit was designed to patch the memory of the exchange while it was running, enable wiretapping while disabling audit logs, patch the commands that list active processes and active data blocks, and modify the data block checksum verification command. A [...] "backdoor" [...] allowed an operator with sysadmin status to deactivate the exchange's transaction log, alarms and access commands related to the surveillance capability. The rootkit was discovered after the intruders installed a faulty update, which caused SMS texts to be undelivered, leading to an automated failure report being generated. Ericsson engineers were called in to investigate the fault and discovered the hidden data blocks containing the list of phone numbers being monitored, along with the rootkit and illicit monitoring software.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Telephone</b> <b>tapping</b> is {{strictly}} regulated in many countries, [...] "especially in all developed democracies, {{to safeguard the}} privacy of telephone users." [...] <b>Telephone</b> <b>tapping</b> often must be authorized by a court, and is normally only approved when evidence shows {{it is not possible}} to detect criminal or subversive activity in less intrusive ways; often the law and regulations require that the crime investigated must be at least of a certain severity. In many jurisdictions however, permission for <b>telephone</b> <b>tapping</b> is easily obtained on a routine basis without further investigation by the court or other entity granting such permission. Illegal or unauthorized <b>telephone</b> <b>tapping</b> is often a criminal offense. However, in certain jurisdictions such as Germany, criminal courts may accept illegally recorded phone calls without the other party's consent as evidence.|$|E
