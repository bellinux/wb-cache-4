5|$|Besides the Conservatives' {{ties to the}} CPR, Rutherford's Liberals {{enjoyed the}} incumbent's {{advantage}} of controlling <b>the</b> <b>levers</b> of patronage, and the election's result was never really in doubt. Before the election, Talbot predicted {{that the government would}} win 18 of the province's 25 seats. Immediately after the election it appeared that the Liberals had won 21; when all the votes had been counted they had won 23 seats to the Conservatives' two. Bennett himself was defeated in his Calgary riding. When the outcome was clear, the people of Strathcona feted Rutherford with a torchlight procession and bonfire.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, within just a year, in 429 BC, the Athenians {{not only}} forgave Pericles but also re-elected him as strategos. He was {{reinstated}} {{in command of}} the Athenian army and led all its military operations during 429 BC, having once again under his control <b>the</b> <b>levers</b> of power. In that year, however, Pericles witnessed the death of both his legitimate sons from his first wife, Paralus and Xanthippus, in the epidemic. His morale undermined, he burst into tears and not even Aspasia's companionship could console him. He himself died of the plague in the autumn of 429 BC.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>lever</b> {{extends to}} <b>the</b> right from a {{vertical}} control shaft. <b>The</b> <b>lever</b> has a neutral position with <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> extended {{directly to the}} right of the pivot. Braking is applied by progressively rotating <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> clockwise, which, due to the position of the level relative to the pivot, is actuated by the operator moving their hand closer to the body - to the [...] "rear". Forward traction is added by rotating <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> counter-clockwise, or [...] "forward". As <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> translates linear motion by the operator into rotary motion of <b>the</b> <b>lever,</b> <b>the</b> level is normally topped with a rotating knob at the right end. This allows the operator to slide <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> without twisting their wrist. The controller often also incorporates a fail-safe device (or dead man's switch) that requires constant downward pressure once <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> is rotated forward from the neutral position. Releasing <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> causes it to pop up on a spring, activating emergency braking.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lever</b> tumbler lock, {{which uses}} a set of <b>levers</b> to prevent <b>the</b> bolt from moving in the lock, was perfected by Robert Barron in 1778. His double acting <b>lever</b> lock {{required}} <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> to be lifted to a certain height by having a slot cut in <b>the</b> <b>lever,</b> so lifting <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> too far was as bad as not lifting <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> far enough. This type of lock is still currently used today.|$|R
50|$|Historically, the {{palettes}} were {{manipulated by}} a ratchet swell, a <b>lever</b> operated by <b>the</b> {{foot to the}} side of <b>the</b> console. <b>The</b> <b>lever</b> would fit into two or three different notches, which would lock the position of <b>the</b> <b>lever,</b> and therefore <b>the</b> shutters, in place. To change the position of <b>the</b> shutters, <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> would be kicked sideways to allow it to travel into a new position. <b>The</b> <b>lever</b> was weighted so that its default position was at the top, with the shutters closed. As <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> was lowered, <b>the</b> shutters would open.|$|R
5|$|In 1228 John Malemort, William the Smith and William the Fletcher {{arrived at}} the castle and began {{production}} operations at a forge built within the bailey. A production level of 120,000 quarrels in a 120-day period was achieved by 1233, with men like Malemort being able to produce up to 100quarrels a day. Quarrels were then put into barrels and shipped across the kingdom in large quantities. Other iron from the castle was sent to build siege engines in Hereford. The manufacturing capability of St Briavels Castle gave the king a distinct advantage over potential baronial enemies, with the supply of arms from the castle to Marcher Lords threatened by the Welsh being one of <b>the</b> <b>levers</b> of royal power during the period.|$|E
5|$|The {{break with}} Rome was not, by itself, a Reformation. That {{was to come}} from the {{dissemination}} of ideas. The views of the German reformer Martin Luther and his school were widely known and disputed in England. A major manifestation of theological radicalism in England was Lollardy, a movement deriving from the writings of John Wycliffe, the 14th century Bible translator, which stressed the primacy of Scripture. But after the execution of Sir John Oldcastle, leader of the Lollard rebellion of 1415, they never again had access to <b>the</b> <b>levers</b> of power, and by the 15th century were much reduced in numbers and influence.|$|E
5|$|Clearly, {{some sort}} of {{flexible}} bag was required to contain an explosive gel so {{that it did not}} matter how the bomb landed on the target. However, a flexible bag is hard to throw and trials had not been at all satisfactory. Discussions of the problem in Macrae's office were overheard by Gordon Norwood, a master printer who Macrae had recruited from his former magazine publishing employer, but he was not directly working on the weapon. Norwood suggested that what was needed was a frangible container and to the annoyance of the War Office store keeper he obtained a 150 W light bulb with which to demonstrate his point: a spherical glass flask inside a sock of woven wool is rigid when thrown, but on contact the glass breaks and the bomb deforms to the required shape. Experiments with glass flasks filled with cold porridge confirmed that this was the way to go. The grenade needed a delay for the thrower to get clear, so the woollen sock was covered in a sticky substance ensuring that the bomb stayed in place for a few seconds before detonating. Having covered the bomb in glue, a non-sticky handle was required. In the handle, a delay fuse was ignited by releasing a sprung lever so that a five second time delay starts as the grenade leaves the thrower's hand (just like <b>the</b> <b>levers</b> found on a conventional Mills bomb type hand grenade).|$|E
50|$|A Johnson bar is a {{hand lever}} with several {{distinct}} positions {{and a positive}} latch to hold <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> in <b>the</b> selected position. The latch is typically activated with a spring-loaded squeeze handle on <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> so that only one hand is needed to release the latch, move <b>the</b> <b>lever,</b> then re-engage <b>the</b> latch in a different position. This is an American English term; in British English, <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> is named for its function.|$|R
50|$|A dheki {{consists}} of a heavy wooden lever, usually about 72 inch m long, supported on a pedestal about 18 inch cm high, which provides a fulcrum. At one end of <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> is a vertical wooden cylinder which functions as a pestle. It is raised by <b>the</b> <b>lever,</b> and that falls down by its own weight. The fulcrum of <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> is placed at five-eighths {{of the length of}} <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> from <b>the</b> pestle.|$|R
50|$|Assuming <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> {{does not}} {{dissipate}} or store energy, the power into <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> must equal <b>the</b> power out of <b>the</b> <b>lever.</b> As <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> rotates around <b>the</b> fulcrum, points farther from this pivot move faster than points {{closer to the}} pivot. Therefore, a force applied to a point farther from the pivot must be less than the force located at a point closer in, because power {{is the product of}} force and velocity.|$|R
5|$|MacLachlan {{reported}} to No. 1 Depot, RAF Uxbridge {{and two days}} later attended No. 2 Central Medical Board on 13 August. He was certified fit to fly and flew Supermarine Spitfire on 21 August. He moved to Bournemouth to see his brother Gordon who was now a pilot officer in No. 501 Squadron RAF. At Queen Mary's Hospital he was fitted with a new arm. MacLachlan explained to the doctors that he required an arm {{that would allow him}} to fly a Hurricane. They designed a limb that allowed him to operate the throttle while taking the control column and firing button with his right hand. They spent hours studying the cockpit layout. The medical staff produced an arm with four spring-loaded pins, like fingers, which enabled him to use the controls on the port side of the cockpit. They secured his left arm to <b>the</b> <b>levers</b> of the throttle quadrant: throttle, propeller pitch control, supercharger and mixture control. The landing gear controls were located on the right side. The artificial arm had to interact with the control column while the gear was being retracted or lowered. His new arm proved sufficient and in September 1941 he flew as many hours in Hurricanes as possible, though not without incident. On 7 September 1941 he force-landed in darkness during a searchlight co-operation exercise. On 28 September 1941 he nearly collided with a Bristol Blenheim in low-cloud. Nevertheless, he was cleared for operational flying on 15 October.|$|E
25|$|The side-lever was an {{adaptation}} of the earliest form of steam engine, the beam engine. The typical side-lever engine {{had a pair of}} heavy horizontal iron beams, known as side levers, connected in the centre {{to the bottom of the}} engine with a pin; this connection allowed a limited arc in which <b>the</b> <b>levers</b> could pivot. These levers extended, on the cylinder side, to each side of the bottom of the vertical engine cylinder. A piston rod, connected vertically to the piston, extended out of the top of the cylinder. This rod attached to a horizontal crosshead which, at each end, was connected to vertical rods (known as side-rods). These rods connected down to <b>the</b> <b>levers</b> on each side of the cylinder. This formed the connection of <b>the</b> <b>levers</b> to the piston on the cylinder side of the engine. The other side of <b>the</b> <b>levers</b> (the opposite end of the lever pivot to the cylinder) were connected to each other with a horizontal crosstail. This crosstail in turn connected to and operated a single connecting rod, which turned the crankshaft. The rotation of the crankshaft was driven by <b>the</b> <b>levers</b> which, at the cylinder side, were driven by the piston oscillating vertically.|$|E
25|$|In {{countries}} {{using the}} Latin script, the center, alphanumeric {{portion of the}} modern keyboard is most often based on the QWERTY design by Christopher Sholes, who laid out the keys {{in such a way}} that common two-letter combinations were placed on opposite sides of the keyboard so that his mechanical keyboard would not jam, and laid out the keys in rows offset horizontally from each other by three-eighths, three-sixteenths, and three-eighths inches to provide room for <b>the</b> <b>levers.</b> Although it has been demonstrated that the QWERTY layout is not the most efficient layout for typing, it remains the standard.|$|E
50|$|The {{culmination}} of the process is that {{the strength of the}} response (measured here as the frequency of lever-pressing) increases.

50|$|To {{test this}} Brady used a yoked control monkey. He placed an 'Executive Monkey' in the {{restraining}} chair, which could press <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> to prevent <b>the</b> electric shock.

25|$|Originally, {{the early}} {{railways}} employed policemen {{to time the}} intervals between trains and to give a 'stop' signal if a train had passed in the previous ten minutes. Developments led to many everyday workings (such as interlocking points) and signal boxes to house <b>the</b> <b>levers</b> that allowed signallers to change the points and signals over a given stretch of railway. These signalboxes were often elevated above the railway due to the locking mechanisms of the signals and points being accommodated on the lower storey. This also allowed the signaller {{to keep an eye}} on things from a good vantage point.|$|E

He made three more trips. He was assisted by Frederick Blake, a wagon examiner and a navy veteran from World War I, who operated the points levers. When they finished, the right hand side of the footplate was too hot to touch, and Blake had to use his hat to work the points as <b>the</b> <b>levers</b> were also too hot to touch. Both men were awarded the George Medal for their courage.|$|E
5000|$|The harp {{mechanism}} was {{a simple}} lever which pivoted on an axle pin located midway up the main body (the [...] "frame") of the stand.

25|$|The Conservative Party {{believes}} {{that in the}} 21st century defence and security are interlinked.

This review will include both defence and homeland security related matters. The Labour Government last conducted a review in 1998. To prevent a long gap in the future it also pledged to hold regular defence reviews every 4–5years, and if necessary will put this requirement into legislation. Party officials claim that the SDSR will be a major improvement, and will ensure that Britain maintains generic and flexible capability to adapt to any changing threats. It will be a cross-departmental review that will begin with foreign policy priorities and will bring together all <b>the</b> <b>levers</b> of domestic national security policy with overseas interests and defence priorities.|$|E
25|$|The {{additional}} funding, though significant, {{expanded the}} scope of the game and causes some setbacks, and for some periods, the Greens lived off loans and donations during the development. Following Joel's death March 2014, Ryan was further committed to completing the game to honor Joel's memory and as a way to cope with his loss, and turned back to work a few days after Joel's funeral. The game, up to that point, had been written based on unknowing of Joel's fate, but with his death, the team recognized that much of what they had in place was more focused on the narrative from Ryan and Amy's side, and made it feel more of a selfish work. There were also concerns from investors about the interactivity of the title. They rewrote about 70% of the game to make it more focused on the interactions with Joel. Originally, the game would have ended with the player witnessing a machine with numerous levers that could be pulled, giving the player some sense of control, but when they examined the machine's internals, found that all of <b>the</b> <b>levers</b> were disconnected, and that they had no control of the situation. Following Joel's death, they felt this scene was no longer applicable, and instead replaced it with the players interacting a final time with Joel in a cathedral in an afterlife-type setting as to bring closure to their story. With the change, Ryan hoped that the game would help others to cope and open up with others with the loss of loved ones. One design decision made was to represent the characters in the game with feature-less faces. Ryan stated that this was both that being a small team they did not have the technical capability to fully program and animate the character's faces, and that by leaving the faces feature-less, it would help players engage by imagining themselves in the place of the game's characters.|$|E

500|$|At {{the moment}} of touchdown, the spoiler lever was in the [...] "ARMED" [...] position. According to the system logic of the A320's flight controls, {{in order for the}} {{spoilers}} to automatically deploy upon touchdown not only must the spoiler lever be in the [...] "ARMED" [...] position, but both thrust levers must be at or close to the [...] "idle" [...] position. The FDR transcript shows that immediately after the warning, the flight computer recorded the left thrust lever being retarded to the rear-most position, activating the thrust reverser on the left engine, while the right thrust lever (controlling the engine with the disabled thrust reverser) remained in the CL position. One theory put forth by CENIPA is that the pilots may not have noticed that the right engine remained at CL because the Airbus autothrottle system, unlike other aircraft manufacturers, does not automatically move <b>the</b> <b>levers</b> when the autothrust controller changes engine settings. Therefore, the pilots may have thought that the right engine was at idle power without realizing that Airbus autothrust logic dictates that, when {{one or more of the}} thrust levers is pulled to the idle position, the autothrust is automatically disengaged. Thus, when the pilot pulled the left engine thrust lever to idle, it disconnected the autothrust system and the computer did not retard the right engine power to idle. The A320's spoilers did not deploy during the landing run, as the right thrust lever was above the [...] "idle" [...] setting required for automatic spoiler deployment. Since the right engine thrust lever was still in the [...] "climb" [...] detent at that time, the right engine accelerated to climb power while the left engine deployed its thrust reverser. The resulting asymmetric thrust condition resulted in a loss of control and a crash ensued.|$|E
500|$|Inevitably {{linked with}} Roosevelt, Taft {{generally}} {{falls in the}} shadow of the flamboyant Rough Rider, who chose him to be president, and who took it away. Yet, a portrait of Taft as a victim of betrayal by his best friend is incomplete: as Coletta put it, [...] "Was he a poor politician because he was victimized or because he lacked the foresight and imagination to notice the storm brewing in the political sky until it broke and swamped him?" [...] Adept at using <b>the</b> <b>levers</b> of power in a way his successor could not, Roosevelt generally got what was politically possible out of a situation. Taft was generally slow to act, and when he did, his actions often generated enemies, as in the Ballinger–Pinchot affair. Roosevelt was able to secure positive coverage in the newspapers; Taft had a judge's reticence in talking to reporters, and, with no comment from the White House, hostile journalists would supply the want with a quote from a Taft opponent. And it was Roosevelt who engraved in public memory the image of Taft as a Buchanan-like figure, with a narrow view of the presidency which made him unwilling to act for the public good. Anderson pointed out that Roosevelt's Autobiography (which placed this view in enduring form) was published after both men had left the presidency (in 1913), was intended in part to justify Roosevelt's splitting of the Republican Party, and contains not a single positive reference to the man Roosevelt had admired and hand-picked as his successor. While Roosevelt was biased, he was not alone: every major newspaper reporter of that time who left reminiscences of Taft's presidency was critical of him. Taft replied to his predecessor's criticism with his constitutional treatise on the powers of the presidency.|$|E
