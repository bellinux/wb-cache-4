500|$|In the song, {{the female}} protagonist feels that her love {{interest}} has underestimated her. This is {{demonstrated in the}} opening lines: [...] "You know I hate sleepin alone, but {{you said that you}} will soon be home. But baby, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> ago." [...] As the song progresses, she also wonders: [...] "What about my body, body?/You don’t want my body, body." [...] According to Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, the female protagonist [...] "literally packs up her pussy" [...] and leaves the man who no longer seems interested in her, shown in the chorus lines: [...] "Let's go, little kitty kat / I think it's time to go / He don't want you anymore." [...] Similarly, Makkada B. Selah of The Village Voice noted that [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] was a threat for [...] "jetting" [...] and John Boone of E! Online commented that it was about Knowles' sex organ. Eb Haynes of AllHipHop commented that [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] warns all restless boys that they too, become restless. Elysa Gardner of USA Today commented that the lyrics of the song include raw feelings for an unfaithful lover which are sung with [...] "sass".|$|E

50|$|Because {{the land}} of heiau was sacred, {{it was not unusual}} for {{successive}} generations to add to original structures and the heiau purpose could change over time. An example is Ulupo heiau in Kailua on Oahu, which {{is said to have been}} built by the menehune, <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time ago. It is thought to have been used first as an agricultural heiau and later as a luakini.|$|R

50|$|A modern take on {{the famous}} fairy tale by Carroll, it <b>is</b> about <b>a</b> {{university}} student (Maggie Grace) who is knocked over by a black cab in London.

I account for the {{deficiencies}} of both the French and Spanish marines something in this way, Greenly. Columbus, and the discovery of America, brought ships and sailors into fashion. But a ship without an officer fit to command her, is like a body without a soul. Fashion, however, brought your young nobles into their services, and men were given vessels because their fathers were dukes and counts, and not because they knew any thing about them." ...|$|E

40|$|Indonesia is {{unlikely}} to become a significantly influential international actor in the medium term, despite its size, strategic location and economic potential. Key findings: Indonesia’s influence in international affairs is growing, {{but it will not}} become a major power in the short to medium term. Facing public pressure to exert influence globally, Indonesia will pursue a far-reaching foreign policy agenda, but without the resources to flex its muscles in support of its ideas. Countries can engage now on regional and global issues <b>that</b> <b>are</b> important to Indonesia and <b>that</b> help it <b>be</b> seen as <b>a</b> global player, thereby building trust and relationships <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> term investment in Indonesia’s future potential...|$|R
60|$|On {{the other}} hand, I {{have a feeling}} of certitude within me that I shall never meet in the flesh my many parents and grandparents--you see, I {{invariably}} killed them off. Heart disease was my favorite way {{of getting rid of}} my mother, though on occasion I did away with her by means of consumption, pneumonia, and typhoid fever. It is true, as the Winnipeg policemen will attest, that I have grandparents living in England; but <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> ago and it is a fair assumption that they are dead by now.

He has gone his way, and I have gone mine, and I've never seen him since. Pray remember me to him."

60|$|A {{great new}} {{experience}} which now {{came to the}} boy was the theatre, which he had sometimes heard his father speak of. There {{had once been a}} theatre in the Boy's Town, when a strolling company came up from Cincinnati, and opened for a season in an empty pork-house. But <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> ago, and, though he had written a tragedy, all that the boy knew of a theatre was from a picture in a Sunday-school book where a stage scene was given to show what kind of desperate amusements a person might come to in middle life if he began by breaking the Sabbath in his youth. His brother had once been taken to a theatre in Pittsburg by one of their river-going uncles, and he often told about it; but my boy formed no conception of the beautiful reality from his accounts of a burglar who jumped from a roof and was chased by a watchman with a pistol up and down a street with houses painted on a curtain.|$|E
500|$|By the 1970s Tunis {{felt his}} message had been ignored or {{misunderstood}} by most Americans, saying [...] "Nobody has paid attention... There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> time when I {{expected to do}} some good. But <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> while ago." [...] This may seem surprising considering that his New York Times obituary referred {{to him as a}} man who [...] "helped educate a whole generation of Americans". Perhaps seen in light of Tunis' distrust of professional athletics, it can be understood. Though he may have felt his message against the commercialization of sports was ignored, there are those who cite Tunis as having made a lasting impact in publishing and to them personally and professionally.|$|R

2500|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{short period}} during the {{introduction}} of printing where parchment and paper were used at the same time, with parchment (in fact vellum) the more expensive luxury option, preferred by rich and conservative customers. Although most copies of the Gutenberg Bible are on paper, some were printed on parchment; 12 of the 48 surviving copies, with most incomplete. In 1490, Johannes Trithemius preferred the older methods, because [...] "handwriting placed on parchment {{will be able to}} endure a thousand years. But how long will printing last, which is dependent on paper? For if ... it lasts for two hundred years <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time." [...] In fact high quality paper from this period has survived 500 years or more very well, if kept in reasonable library conditions.|$|R
60|$|But such disgraces are soon lived down, even at ten years, and a {{great new}} {{experience}} which now came to him possibly helped the boy to forget.

60|$|Few people passed. The {{man out of}} {{the last}} house passed on his way home; she heard his {{footsteps}} clacking along the concrete pavement and afterwards crunching on the cinder path before the new red houses. One time {{there used to be a}} field there in which they used to play every evening with other people's children. Then a man from Belfast bought the field and built houses in it--not like their little brown houses but bright brick houses with shining roofs. The children of the avenue used to play together in that field--the Devines, the Waters, the Dunns, little Keogh the cripple, she and her brothers and sisters. Ernest, however, never played: he was too grown up. Her father used often to hunt them in out of the field with his blackthorn stick; but usually little Keogh used to keep nix and call out when he saw her father coming. Still they seemed to have been rather happy then. Her father was not so bad then; and besides, her mother was alive. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> ago; she and her brothers and sisters were all grown up; her mother was dead. Tizzie Dunn was dead, too, and the Waters had gone back to England. Everything changes. Now she was going to go away like the others, to leave her home.|$|E
60|$|That {{night in}} bed, excited {{and a little}} flushed still by her {{glass of wine and}} the secrecy of the second toast, she lay with her prayer-book opened flat, and her eyes fixed on a ceiling yellowed by the light from her reading-lamp. Young things! It was so nice for them all! And she would be so happy if she could see dear Soames happy. But, of course, he must be now, in spite of what Imogen had said. He would have all that he wanted: property, and wife, and {{children}}! And he would live to a green old age, like his dear father, and forget all about Irene and that dreadful case. If only she herself could be here to buy his children their first rocking-horse! Smither should choose it for her at the stores, nice and dappled. Ah! how Roger used to rock her until she fell off! Oh dear! <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> ago! It was! 'In my Father's house are many mansions--'A little scrattling noise caught her ear--'but no mice!' she thought mechanically. The noise increased. There! it was a mouse! How naughty of Smither to say there wasn't! It would be eating through the wainscot before they knew where they were, and they would have to have the builders in. They were such destructive things! And she lay, with her eyes just moving, following in her mind that little scrattling sound, and waiting for sleep to release her from it.|$|E
