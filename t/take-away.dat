The video has a similar impromptu charm to the many intimate, one-shot performance clips popularized by Vincent Moon's <b>Take-Away</b> Shows, its appeal compounded by the shock of seeing such a notoriously manicured superstar without embellishment. It's all quite endearing and personal – two words one might not often associate with this superhumanly talented and famous couple.|$|E

25|$|After the meeting, the Director of Liquor Licensing {{ruled that}} {{restrictions}} on <b>take-away</b> alcohol in Fitzroy Crossing would exist indefinitely.

In particular, “broodje pom” is rapidly gaining popularity and starting to appear on the Dutch menu. It can sometimes even be ordered in Dutch <b>take-aways</b> and for home-delivery. In recent years, more and more recipes for Pom have appeared in Dutch cookbooks, newspapers and on websites.
