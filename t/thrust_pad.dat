The focus of this study is on the influence of the thrust bearing on the lateral vibrations of theshaft of a 72 -MW propeller turbine. The thrust bearing has a non-conventional design with alarge radius and two rows of <b>thrust</b> <b>pads.</b> A numerical model is developed to estimate naturalfrequencies. Numerical results are analyzed and related to experimental measurements of arunaway test. The results show the need to include the thrust bearing in the model.

40|$|Surface texture in {{the surface}} of the thrust bearing reduces the {{friction}} coefficient and wear rate of the matting surface. Significant improvement in load carrying capacity, wear resistance and friction coefficient of the tribiological mechanical component can be achieved by forming regular micro structure in form of micro dimple on the <b>thrust</b> <b>pad</b> bearing surface. In the present work numerical analysis is carried out to investigate the effect of spherical, cylindrical, elliptical, rectangular and square texture on the <b>thrust</b> <b>pad</b> hydrodynamic bearing and a comparison is done with the plain thrust bearing. The above texture profile was chosen in the view to easy fabrication of such texture using laser technology or etching process. These textured pads are tested on the various type of operating condition. The Reynolds equations are solved numerically by the finite difference method and an analysis is done on the effect of texture height, aspect ratio, and number of textures both in radial and circumferential directions on <b>thrust</b> <b>pad</b> bearing. It is observed that the load carrying capacity increases with increase of texture height ratio. This is because as texture height is increased it restricts the flow of lubricants which increases pressure and load carrying capacity. The analysis shows as aspect ratio is increased the roughness of surface is increased so pressure is increased, which result is increasing load carrying capacity. However with very larger value of aspect ratio the roughness of surface decreases, which decreases the load carrying capacity. Similar studies the done for behavior of coefficient of friction on variation of aspect ratio, texture height ratio etc. The author believes that such detail analysis on different texture profile on <b>thrust</b> <b>pad</b> hydrodynamic to study different tribological behavior under different condition will help researchers around the world...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} trend in the {{replacement}} of the babbit facing in <b>thrust</b> <b>pad</b> bearings with a composite polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) surface layer. The PTFE-faced bearings have been shown to allow a greater specific pressure, reduce thermal crowning, and, in some cases, negate the need for an oil-lift (jacking) system. These designs of bearing require new methods for the measurement of oil film thickness both to assist in their development and for plant condition monitoring. In this work, an ultrasonic method of oil film measurement is evaluated for this purpose. An ultrasonic transducer is mounted on the back face of the <b>thrust</b> <b>pad.</b> Pulses are generated and transmitted through the pad material, bonding interlayer, and PTFE surface layer. The proportion of the wave that reflects back from the oil film layer is determined. This is then related to the oil film thickness using a series of calibration experiments and a spring stiffness model. In practice, the reflected signal is difficult to distinguish, in the time domain, from other internal reflections from the pad. Signals are compared with reflections when no oil film is present and processing is carried out in the frequency domain. Experiments have been performed on a full size PTFE-faced <b>thrust</b> <b>pad</b> destined for a hydroelectric power station turbine. The instrumented pad was installed in a test facility and subjected to a range of loading conditions both with and without oil lift. Although there were some problems with the robustness of the experimental procedure, oil films were successfully measured and used to study the effect of the oil-lift system on film formation.

40|$|The {{variations}} of the supporting condition, which change the stiffness of tilting pad thrust bearing, may alter the dynamic behavior of the rotor system. The effects of supporting condition of <b>thrust</b> <b>pad</b> on the lateral vibration of a hydroelectric generating set are investigated in this paper. The action of a thrust bearing is described as moments acting on the thrust collar, and the tilting stiffness coefficients of thrust bearing are calculated. A model based on typical beam finite element method is established to calculate the dynamic response, {{and the effects of}} supporting conditions such as elastic oil tank support, different heights of the thrust pads with rigid support are discussed. The results reveal that the influence of thrust bearing is small when the elastic oil tanks work normally. When the supporting conditions turn to be rigid due to the oil leakage, the differences of <b>thrust</b> <b>pad</b> heights have evident influence on the load distribution of the thrust pads; while the effects on the tilting stiffness of the thrust bearing and the amplitude of the lateral shaft vibration is small when the maximum load on thrust pads is smaller than the allowable value...|$|E

The bearing’s motion is simulated three-dimensionally, including roughness interaction and asperity contact. Solutions are obtained regarding the friction, flow rate, power loss, and stiffness.

The fluid load capacity was dramatically affected by the roughness directional pattern. The skewness had a lower effect than the roughness directional pattern.

40|$|Operators of {{hydroelectric}} power stations sometimes call upon engineers to modify existing hydroelectric turbines, usually several decades old, for improved maintainability and reliability. One common modification is the hybridisation of plain <b>thrust</b> <b>pads</b> to allow hydrostatic operation {{to reduce the}} risk of bearing wipe at low speed (virtually all new installations benefit from this feature). A modification such as this is not a difficult undertaking; however, there are numerous factors that need to be considered in order to maximize bearing performance. One factor that stands out above the others is whether the thrust bearing should be designed to lift the turbine immediately from the standing condition, which presents an interesting challenge: the recess has to have a sufficiently large area in order for the supply pressure to be able to overcome the dead weight of the turbine. If the combination of groove area and pressure is insufficient, then lifting is neither immediate nor guaranteed. This need not be a significant problem, as the bearings have exhibited adequate performance even in the absence of a hydrostatic lubricant supply. A case study is presented whereby relatively large hydrostatic recesses are added to the <b>pads</b> of <b>thrust</b> bearing. It is demonstrated with the aid of simple numerical modelling that the impact of the recess relative to the original pad is small under normal operating conditions. Most surprising, however, is that significant reductions in average oil film temperature and power dissipation are predicted...|$|R

40|$|Oil-film tilting <b>pad</b> <b>thrust</b> {{bearings}} {{are mainly}} used {{in supporting the}} high axial load of the turbine shaft in vertical hydroelectric units or smaller axial loads of turbo machines. The trend for these applications is to replace the white metal with a polymeric material layer such as PTFE or PEEK, improving the bearing performances and extending its operating conditions. This leads to a reduction of the bearing overall dimensions {{as a consequence of}} the load capacity increase. Apart the friction and the resistance to chemical attacks properties of the polymeric layer, the main cause on the improved performances of the bearing is the compliance of the pad layer. In particular the polymeric layer reduces the typical pad crowning allowing a more uniform pressure distribution over the pad and a reduction of its maximum value with respect to Babbitt metal pads. Therefore, the design of layered pad requires a deeper investigation such as thermoelastohydrodynamic (TEHD) analyses, including oil thermal effects and bearing thermal deformation.

40|$|In porous resistances, Darcy's law {{provides}} a good approximation of mass flow rate when the differences between upstream and downstream pressures are sufficiently small. In this range, the mass flow rates are proportional to the porous resistance's permeability. For gas bearings, the pressure difference is normally higher, and it is known experimentally that the mass flow rates are lower than would result from Darcy's law. Forchheimer's law adds an inertial term to Darcy's law and, when an appropriate coefficient is selected for this term, {{provides a}} good approximation of flow rates for the same applications even with the highest pressure differences.

40|$|LectureTilting pad {{bearings}} {{are used}} extensively in high power and/or high speed pump applications. Traditional white metallined {{also known as}} babbitted tilting pad bearings are used for oil lubricated bearings. Babbitted tilting pad bearings are not ideal for applications with low viscous lubricants, like waterbased fluids. For these applications, polymer bearings offer many advantages over traditional bearing materials including: Low friction coefficient, Higher flexibility, Wide range of operational temperature, High corrosion and chemical resistance, High shock and impact resistance, Tolerance against particle contamination, Electrical insulation. To achieve the desired improvement in performance, the material specifics of the polymer have to be carefully considered in the design process. One option available is a polymer lined tilting pad bearing which combines the excellent tribological properties of polymers and the high structural stiffness of the steel back. But a polymer lined metal pad does not provide the same equalizing effect offered by the higher compressibility of a solid polymer pad. For example the problems of an edge carrier can be reduced for a tilting pad journal bearing and the self-equalizing mechanism can be avoided for a tilting <b>pad</b> <b>thrust</b> bearing while considering the higher flexibility of solid PEEK pads. An additional advantage of a solid polymer pad is {{the elimination of the}} bonding between the polymer and the steel, so that a possible source of a bearing failure can be avoided upfront already. During a qualification test of a commercially available solid polymer tilting <b>pad</b> <b>thrust</b> bearing, the high Hertzian contact stress at the pivot let to indentations in the polymer. After a few operating hours these indentations are clearly visible and will finally lead to a complete loss of the advantages of a tilting pad bearing over a fixed geometry bearing. This lecture describes the steps involved in the optimization of the solid polymer tilting pad bearing design, with the objective to increase the reliability of the bearing assembly. The limitations of the available solid polymer tilting <b>pad</b> <b>thrust</b> bearing have been overcome by the integration of a metal reinforced pivot as mentioned by Gassmann et al. (2013). The results of the TEHD analysis presented form the base of the optimized journal and thrust bearing design.

The data collected during tests with the optimized thrust and journal bearings are in excellent agreement with the simulations. With the optimized bearing design, the limitations of the original pad design have been mitigated. The successfully qualified journal and thrust bearing are one of the building blocks required for product lubricated pumps and will be used in subsea pump applications...|$|R
