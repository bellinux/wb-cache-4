500|$|There {{were times}} when Lady Rosebery's devotion to her husband was tested. Rosebery may have not been antisemitic before his {{marriage}}; however, the acerbic wit {{for which he was}} famous led him <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>remarks</b> that could have been taken in such a way, once his marriage had secured the Rothschild fortune. Rosebery seems to have disliked his first son, who he claimed looked [...] "Jewish." [...] On seeing his son {{for the first time he}} remarked [...] "Le Jew est fait, rien ne vas plus," [...] which must have been disconcerting for the child's very Jewish mother. Rosebery, who has been described as febrile and supercilious, replied in a letter of congratulations on the birth of his heir from Mary Gladstone: [...] "I cannot pretend to be much excited by an event which occurs to almost every human being and which may cause me a great deal of annoyance." [...] Rosebery then left his newborn child and wife (who was again pregnant) for a year-long tour of Australia. On another occasion, when the Roseberys were travelling in India, Rosebery is reported to have announced [...] "I will travel ahead, Hannah and the rest of the heavy baggage will follow the next day." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{election}} {{observers and}} representatives of the media may [...] participate in the counting of votes in polling districts and constituencies or municipalities, and also in the establishment of election results. Observers [...] shall have the right <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>remarks</b> and claims to the electoral committees concerning violations of laws, but may not hinder the work of electoral committees. Observers can make written protests to the polling district committee, which is appended to the vote counting record of the polling district and delivered to the constituency electoral committee.|$|E
60|$|It {{was not a}} {{time for}} Dickory <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>remarks</b> {{indicating}} his disapproval of the proposed arrangement.|$|E
60|$|But Wedderburn did {{not answer}} her. She was indeed {{one of those people}} who seemed destined <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{unanswered}} <b>remarks.</b>|$|R
60|$|Osborn frowned. It was Jardine's habit <b>to</b> <b>make</b> stupid <b>remarks</b> like that; Osborn {{wondered}} whether the fellow thought them smart.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Doncastle seemed {{inclined}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> no <b>remark</b> {{during the}} dressing, {{and at last}} Menlove could repress herself no longer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{mind what}} I said," [...] replied Mrs. Walrond severely, [...] "especially as I was mistaken. It is very rude {{of your father}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>remarks</b> about the meat." ...|$|E
6000|$|A girl's {{voice said}} passionately: [...] "I don't care! I shan't leave them here for folks <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>remarks</b> about! I knew they wouldn't take the premium, and I hope you're {{satisfied}} now, mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{was again}} {{something}} peculiar about Frank's expression and manner, as he said, [...] "Well, {{it would not}} signify much, I daresay, if people were <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>remarks</b> about you and Miss Ward, for you know {{it would not be}} misconstruction after all." ...|$|E
5000|$|Upon Martin O'Malley's exit, Senator Bernie Sanders {{stepped onto}} the stage <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his <b>remarks.</b> When protest chants erupted again, Senator Sanders could be heard {{speaking}} to the host, saying [...] "It's fine" [...] if the conference hosts wanted to yield the floor to the protestors, but that he didn't {{want to play a}} game of shouting over one another. Sanders went on <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his <b>remarks</b> and give a brief Question & Answer period.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now for Anne's real poem, Rupert,' said Elizabeth, not {{choosing}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> any <b>remarks,</b> lest Rupert {{should consider}} them as compliments.|$|R
60|$|I {{was about}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a <b>remark,</b> {{but had no}} chance, for my wife threw herself upon my bosom, sobbing with joy.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon, if I have said {{anything}} to hurt you, Dodo," [...] said Celia, with a slight sob. She never could have thought that she should feel as she did. There was something funereal in the whole affair, and Mr. Casaubon {{seemed to be the}} officiating clergyman, about whom it would be indecent <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>remarks.</b>|$|E
60|$|There {{are times}} when I doubt if {{children}} are as simple as they look. If it be sheer stupidity that prompts them <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>remarks</b> of this character, one should pity them, and seek to improve them. But if it be not stupidity? well then, one should still seek to improve them, but by a different method.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know all}} that, mother. What {{are you trying}} to cover up that you are so talkative? It isn't your usual way of doing business. Well, it is a bargain--you shall have your money when you produce the evidence. And now really if we stop here much longer people will begin <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>remarks,</b> for who shall escape aspersion in this {{censorious}} world? So good-night, mother, good-night," [...] and he turned to leave the room.|$|E
50|$|Dellius liked <b>to</b> <b>make</b> mocking <b>remarks</b> {{and he was}} {{allegedly}} the matchmaker for Antony to satisfy his erotic passions. Therefore Cleopatra could not stand him.|$|R
60|$|Guy hesitated. He too {{was about}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a <b>remark</b> {{that would have}} been {{unfavourable}} to the character of his late uncle, so he checked himself.|$|R
60|$|It was {{enjoyment}} for Duane <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his <b>remarks</b> <b>to</b> {{these men}} pregnant with meaning. Morton showed his pleasure, his interest, but his faith held aloof.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nothing, Uncle Abner.' She {{walked to}} the window, and, as if to tide over what was plainly passing in their minds about her, she began <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>remarks</b> on objects in the street. 'What a quaint being--look, Charlotte!' It was an old woman sitting by a stall on the {{opposite}} side of the way, which seemed suddenly to hit Paula's sense of the humorous, though beyond the fact that the dame was old and poor, and wore a white handkerchief over her head, there was really nothing noteworthy about her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha! Say you so, old True Penny? The Kunnel has met a foeman {{worthy of}} his steel," [...] said Foster, in great glee, as he bent above the Colonel. [...] "I know. How do I know, quotha? By the curve on the Kunnel's back. The {{size of the}} {{parabola}} described by that backbone accurately gauges his adversary's skill. But, by the way, gentlemen, have you--but that's a nice point, and I refer all nice points to Professor Knapp. Professor, is it in good taste <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>remarks</b> concerning the dress or features of another?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Zobeida and Amina {{made some}} {{difficulty}} about admitting the new comers, and Sadie knew the reason of their hesitation. But she urged the matter so strongly that Zobeida was at last forced to consent. [...] "Bring them in, then," [...] said she, [...] "but make them {{understand that they}} are not <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>remarks</b> about what does not concern them, and be sure to make them read the inscription over the door." [...] For on the door was written in letters of gold, [...] "Whoso meddles in affairs that are no business of his, will hear truths that will not please him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That boy {{will never}} {{understand}} our foreign relations. Ethiopia in Asia!" [...] {{he said to}} himself, {{but he did not}} choose <b>to</b> <b>make</b> any <b>remark</b> at the moment.|$|R
60|$|He did not venture <b>to</b> <b>make</b> any <b>remark,</b> nor did Bill {{think it}} wise {{to repeat the}} threat; but he shook his fist warningly, which served the same purpose.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nor {{was there}} any reason why she should. As for Chickerel, he doubtless felt how unbecoming it would be <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{personal}} <b>remarks</b> upon one of your guests--Ha-ha-ha! Well, well--Ha-ha-ha-ha!' ...|$|R
6000|$|But if {{to power}} and place your passion lie, If in the pomp of life consist the joy; Then hire a slave, or (if you will) a lord [...] 100 To do the honours, and to give the word; Tell at your lev√©e, as the crowds approach, To whom to nod, whom take into your coach, Whom honour with your hand: <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>remarks,</b> Who rules in Cornwall, or who rules in Berks: 'This may be troublesome, is near the chair: That makes three members, this can choose a mayor.' Instructed thus, you bow, embrace, protest, Adopt him son, or cousin at the least, Then turn about, and laugh at your own jest. [...] 110 ...|$|E
6000|$|These {{feats of}} {{activity}} over, the four gentlemen now strolled {{out of the}} tavern garden into the public walk, where, by this time, {{a great deal of}} company was assembled: upon whom Mr. Jack, who was of a frank and free nature, with a loud voice, chose <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>remarks</b> that were not always agreeable. And here, if my Lord March made a joke, of which his lordship was not sparing, Jack roared, [...] "Oh, ho, ho! Oh, good Gad! Oh, my dear earl! Oh, my dear lord, you'll be the death of me!" [...] "It seemed as if he wished everybody to know," [...] writes Harry sagaciously to Mrs. Mountain, [...] "that his friend and companion was an Erl!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Before {{they reached}} Rome {{this young man}} was tacitly of their party. They did not know his name nor what he was, but it seemed he taught, and Miss Winchelsea had a shrewd idea he was an {{extension}} lecturer. At any rate he was something of that sort, something gentlemanly and refined without being opulent and impossible. She tried once or twice to ascertain whether he came from Oxford or Cambridge, but he missed her timid importunities. She {{tried to get him}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>remarks</b> about those places to see if he would say [...] "come up" [...] to them instead of [...] "go down"--she knew that was how you told a 'Varsity man. He used the word [...] "'Varsity"--not university--in quite the proper way.|$|E
60|$|I {{am about}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a <b>remark.</b> It is, of course, {{applicable}} to the very serious matter now under notice, or I should not allow it to appear in this place.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{movement}} under the cloth, {{and a little}} snake wriggled out, to be back-broken by {{the butt of the}} mahseer-rod. I was sufficiently sick <b>to</b> <b>make</b> no <b>remarks</b> worth recording.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{provoking}} thing; you {{are always}} right!" [...] cries Hetty, [...] "and that's what makes me so angry. Indeed, Harry, it was very wrong of me <b>to</b> <b>make</b> rude <b>remarks</b> about any of your relations." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{are often}} told that an author never wholly loses his affection {{for a first}} book, and the feeling has been likened (more than once) {{to that of a}} parent towards a first-born. I have not said it, but in consenting to this reprint I {{considered}} that a writer's early or unregarded work is apt to be raked up when he is not standing by <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>remarks.</b> He may be absent on a journey from which he is not expected to return. It accordingly seemed better that I should myself supervise a new edition, since this would enable me to remove a few of the numerous spots and pimples which decorate the ingenious countenance of the work before handing it on to posterity.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't want to {{be taken}} for {{anything}} that I am not, mother. What with reading and with going two hours twice a week of an evening for six years, to talk and work with Mr. Merton, I hope I can express myself properly when I choose. As you know, when I'm away from you I talk as others do, for I hate any one <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>remarks.</b> If the time ever comes when I am {{to take a step}} up, it will be time enough for them to talk; at present, all that the other lads think of me is, that I am fond of reading, and that I can lick any fellow of my own age in the mine," [...] and he laughed lightly. [...] "And now, mother, I shall go in and tell Mr. Merton what I have made up my mind to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt, no doubt," [...] {{answered}} the Colonel, who always received this lady's remarks, playful or serious, with a peculiar softness and kindness. [...] "But the General is the General, {{and it is}} not for me <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>remarks</b> on his Excellency's doings at table or elsewhere. I think very likely that military gentlemen born and bred at home are different from us of the colonies. We have such a hot sun, that we need not wine to fire our blood as they do. And drinking toasts seems a point of honour with them. Talmadge hiccupped to me--I should say, whispered to me just now, that an officer could no more refuse a toast than a challenge, and he said that it was after the greatest difficulty and dislike at first that he learned to drink. He has certainly overcome his difficulty with uncommon resolution." ...|$|E
60|$|Here O'Connor paused <b>to</b> <b>make</b> some parenthetical <b>remarks</b> with which, indeed, he interlarded {{the whole}} letter.|$|R
6000|$|Master Lord {{came down}} the ladder with a noisy welcome, as if it pleased him to see us thus {{apparently}} contented, and before he had an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>make</b> any <b>remark,</b> Hiram asked {{in a tone of}} curiosity: ...|$|R
60|$|Here Bear's Meat availed {{himself of}} another pause <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a <b>remark.</b> This {{he did with}} the keenness of one {{accustomed}} to watch words and events closely, but with a simplicity that showed no vulgar disposition to scepticism.|$|R
