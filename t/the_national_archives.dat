5|$|Prior to 1953, {{the office}} of the National Herald (Riksheraldiker) was {{responsible}} for preparing municipal arms and the royal arms of Sweden, but today these duties are carried out by the Heraldry Board of <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Archives,</b> including the State Herald (Statsheraldiker). In order to register new municipal arms, a municipality must submit its proposal to both <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Archives</b> Heraldry Board, which consults and renders an opinion, and to the PRV for registration. Once the board has completed its consultation process and provided a warrant of arms, the arms thus warranted may then be registered by the PRV and implemented by the municipality. Apart from municipal arms, heraldic arms registered by counties and by military and other government bodies are also handled by <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Archives</b> Heraldry Board and the PRV.|$|E
