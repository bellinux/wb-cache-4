5|$|After {{the coup}} and Piłsudski's reign as dictator, he often clashed with Catholic leaders but nevertheless, enjoyed good working {{relationship}} with Cardinal Aleksander Kakowski, who subsequently led his funeral mass. In 1937, Archbishop of Kraków, Adam Stefan Sapieha, ordered to move Piłsudski's coffin from St. Leonard's Crypt to Royal Tombs at Wawel. This led to open conflict with <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> government, which threatened to step down.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the city}} and the horizon are several rural islands, which today form part of central Stockholm. Behind <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> castle is Skeppsholmen, which for centuries served as a base for the Swedish Navy {{together}} with Kastellholmen islet, which can be seen above the Blackfriars monastery. To the left of Skeppsholmen are two small islets, which are today merged into the peninsula of Blasieholmen. Behind these islands are Djurgården (right), Östermalm, and Norra Djurgården (left). On the horizon, the Lilla Värtan strait passes in front of Lidingö and, arguably, the interior islands of the Stockholm archipelago.|$|E

5|$|Gaston B. Cashwell, a {{minister}} of the Methodist Church, joined Crumpler's group in 1903. He became a leading figure in <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Pentecostal movement on the east coast. In 1906, he traveled to Los Angeles to visit the Pentecostal revival at the Azusa Street mission. While there he professed having received the baptism in the Holy Spirit and the evidence of speaking in tongues. Upon returning to Dunn, North Carolina, in December 1906, Cashwell preached the Pentecost experience in the local holiness church.|$|E
5|$|Hebron Church is on {{the plain}} of a {{predominantly}} rural agricultural and forested area of southeastern Hampshire County, in the Cacapon River Valley. Baker Mountain, a forested, narrow anticlinal mountain ridge, rises west of <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> western rolling foothills of the anticlinal Great North Mountain rise east of the valley. The Cacapon River, just southeast of the church, is hidden from the church and cemetery by mature foliage. George Washington National Forest, encompassing the forested area east of the Cacapon River, is east of the church.|$|E
5|$|In {{central and}} eastern Europe, the state played {{a greater role in}} organising these pilgrimages. The National Orthodox Romanian Women's Society, {{supported}} by <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> state, played an important part in enabling regular pilgrimages to important Romanian sites up until 1939. In Germany and Italy, the Fascist governments took a keen interest in organising such journeys. In Italy, these involved large, state-influenced organisations, and the government steadily discouraged private visits or unofficial groups from taking part in alternative ceremonies at these sites. In Nazi Germany, pilgrimages were organised to the new war memorials sponsored by the government in the 1930s.|$|E

5|$|Jelling, in Denmark, is {{the largest}} royal {{memorial}} from the Viking Age and it was made by Harald Bluetooth in memory of his parents Gorm and Tyra, and in honour of himself. It {{was only one of}} the two large tumuli that contained a chamber tomb, but both barrows, <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two Jelling stones testify to how important it was to mark death ritually during the pagan era and the earliest Christian times.|$|E
5|$|Organizations {{may also}} be {{directed}} specifically at influencing persons at some stage of life. Thus, we have midwives and doctors who are legally obliged to deliver the baby; as the child grows, the school, parents, and mass media come to the fore; as they reach working age, various economic organisations pull for the agent's attention; <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> institution of marriage impact the actor in obvious ways; and finally, the State may provide a pension to the elderly (Russell 1938:166–168).|$|E
5|$|Parish worship {{transferred}} to the new church, {{along with some of}} the fittings. The old church was thereafter used as a mortuary chapel for a time. The churchyard continued to be used for burials until 1902. In modern times, the owners of Plas Llanidan have restored the church, and it is used by them as a private chapel. The churchyard is kept locked, but <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> gardens of Plas Llanidan are occasionally opened to the public.|$|E

The 19th-century Calvinistic Methodist preacher Richard Owen was born in the parish, and is buried in the graveyard that surrounds the church.|$|E
5|$|Puddletown's parish {{church has}} {{significant}} architectural interest, particularly its furnishings and monuments. It has a 12th-century font and well-preserved woodwork, including 17th-century box pews. Thomas Hardy {{took an interest}} in <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> village provided the inspiration for the fictional settlement of Weatherbury in his novel Far from the Madding Crowd; Weatherbury Farm, the home of principal character Bathsheba Everdene, is based on a manor house within the parish.|$|E
5|$|Rivington {{village is}} a {{conservation}} area, designated under section 69 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990; {{almost half the}} houses in the village centre have listed status. Rivington's buildings are varied, reflecting its rural and historic nature, and include former hand-loom weavers' cottages, <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> chapel. Locally sourced stone for walls and slate for roofs are the predominant building materials, used for places of worship, the school, houses (including many not listed), and boundary dry stone walls. An exception is Fisher House, a three-storey Georgian rendered building.|$|E

5|$|Scott's {{alterations}} proved {{successful in}} stabilising {{the tower and}} in serving the needs of <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> church remained little changed for the next 130years; the most notable alterations during this period were {{the replacement of the}} glass in the chancel's two leper windows with stained glass images of Pre-Raphaelite knights by Edward Burne-Jones as a memorial to a young officer killed during the Boer War, and the painting of a mural over the chancel arch by John Ward depicting the events of Holy Week in modern dress and set in the Chilterns. In 1951 the church was Grade A listed.|$|E
5|$|The Hussite Wars, {{also known}} as the Hussite Crusade, {{involved}} military action against the Bohemian Reformation in the Kingdom of Bohemia and the followers of early Czech church reformer Jan Hus, who was burned at the stake in 1415. Crusades were declared five times during that period: in 1420, 1421, 1422, 1427, and 1431. These expeditions forced the Hussite forces, who disagreed on many doctrinal points, to unite to drive out the invaders. The wars ended in 1436 with the ratification of the compromise Compacts of Basel by <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Hussites.|$|E
5|$|The Lower Parsonage, {{attached}} to Chesham Woburn, stood immediately {{east of the}} church, between <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Old Town. It was demolished in around 1769 by John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford, and replaced by a new vicarage for the vicar of the newly unified parish. This vicarage remains {{attached to}} the parish, and since the re-amalgamation of the Chesham parishes in the 1980s and 1990s {{is known as the}} Rectory.|$|E

5|$|Zwingli {{believed}} that the state governed with divine sanction. He {{believed that}} both <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> state are placed under the sovereign rule of God.

He described a preference for an aristocracy over monarchic or democratic rule.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failure}} of his first marriage, Waugh {{converted}} to Catholicism in 1930. His traditionalist stance led him to strongly oppose all attempts to reform <b>the</b> <b>Church,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> changes by the Second Vatican Council (1962–65) greatly disturbed his sensibilities, especially {{the introduction of the}} vernacular Mass. That blow to his religious traditionalism, his dislike for the welfare state culture of the postwar world and the decline of his health, darkened his final years, but he continued to write. To the public, Waugh displayed a mask of indifference, but he was capable of great kindness to those whom he considered to be his friends. After his death in 1966, he acquired a following of new readers through the film and television versions of his works, such as the television serial Brideshead Revisited (1981).|$|E
