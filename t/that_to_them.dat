5|$|In {{contrast}} to Roman recruits, {{the vast majority}} of barbarian recruits were probably volunteers, drawn by conditions of service and career prospects <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> probably appeared desirable, in {{contrast to}} their living conditions at home. A minority of barbarian recruits were enlisted by compulsion, namely dediticii (barbarians who surrendered to the Roman authorities, often to escape strife with neighbouring tribes) and tribes who were defeated by the Romans, and obliged, as a condition of peace, to undertake to provide a specified number of recruits annually. Barbarians could be recruited directly, as individuals enrolled into regular regiments, or indirectly, as members of irregular foederati units transformed into regular regiments.|$|E
25|$|While trolls {{believe that}} they do not face {{consequences}} and can troll others on the Internet without repercussions, in the 2000s, due to high-profile cases where cyberbullies have allegedly been factors in suicides attributed to bullying, more laws have been put in place by governments. Trolls can face going to prison for certain actions that they take on the Internet, such as spreading hate speech such as racist messages. One of the highest profile cases is racist trolling. Racist trolling has seen individuals been sent to prison for Tweets they have sent <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> may have seemed harmless and not racist. One case of this in recent years is Liam Stacey who was jailed for fifty-six days for tweeting offensive messages such as 'Muamba is dead, hahahaha', referring to when footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed during a professional football game for Bolton Wanders (Williams, 2012). This highlights how offensive tweets and messages sent on any social networking platform does have repercussions for individuals {{and they have to be}} aware that they have to face the consequences of their actions.|$|E

Disregarding what they described as [...] "the practice of political condencendence", the organization cited an ongoing migration to support {{the conclusion that the}} territorial status was [...] "in decay" [...] and asserting that this was a [...] "clear signal" [...] to act against. Noting that not even [...] "the most sophisticated and philosophical arguments" [...] would be able to distance them from their current postures, the EPB stated that they would [...] "never renounce armed resistance". The organization concluded this message by warning the local and federal governments that they would continue with this strategy to [...] "honor the martyrs".|$|E

500|$|His {{best known}} {{excavation}} was undertaken from 1928 to 1930 at Skara Brae in the Orkney Islands. Uncovering a well-preserved Neolithic village, in 1931 he published the excavation {{results in a}} book titled Skara Brae. He nevertheless made an error of interpretation, erroneously attributing the site to the Iron Age. Getting on particularly well with the locals, it is reported <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> [...] "he was every inch the professor" [...] because of his eccentric appearance and habits. In 1932, Childe, collaborating with anthropologist C. Daryll Forde, excavated two Iron Age hillforts at Earn's Hugh on the Berwickshire coast, while in June 1935 he excavated a promontory fort at Larriban near to Knocksoghey in Northern Ireland. Together with Wallace Thorneycroft, another Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, Childe excavated two vitrified Iron Age forts in Scotland, at Finavon, Angus (1933–34) and at Rahoy, Argyllshire (1936–37). In 1938, he and Walter Grant oversaw excavations at the Neolithic settlement of Rinyo; excavation ceased during the Second World War, but resumed in 1946.|$|E

[...] Against the superior power of those who calmly and calculatedly grew rich, he wrote somewhere else, the Halbertsmas could only [...] "avenge themselves through satire." ...|$|E
2500|$|By July, the Jacobites {{had eight}} battalions and two companies, almost all Highlanders. Dundee gained the {{confidence}} of the clans by cultivating the allegiance of each Highlander and respecting the precedence of the clans. He realised <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> the cause of Jacobitism was secondary. At a time when infantry were trained to fight in formation, the Highlanders' method was more informal. They set aside their plaids and other encumbrances before the battle, and dropped to the ground to avoid enemy volleys. [...] After quickly returning fire, they pursued their foes, screaming in the Highland charge. They used heavy broadswords and targe (shield), or whatever weapons they had, including pitchforks or Lochaber axes (a combined axe and spear on a long pole). Such a charge was devastating to troops struggling to reform their lines, or fix the recently introduced 'plug' bayonets.|$|E
