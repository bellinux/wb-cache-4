Runyon's largely intact steel or iron Bluff Dale Suspension bridge with wooden stringers and decking in Bluff Dale, Texas (1890), or his weeks earlier but ruined Barton Creek Bridge between Huckabay, Texas and Gordon, Texas (1889 or 1890). [...] In the twentieth century, early examples of cable-stayed bridges included A.

Leinekugel le Coq's bridge at Lézardrieux in Brittany (1924). Eduardo Torroja designed a cable-stayed aqueduct at Tempul in 1926.

30|$|In 2005, Sakamoto et al. [69], {{put forward}} the {{multi-layer}} tensioning system, {{which is a}} combination of the double tensioning system and a layer of <b>tie</b> <b>cables,</b> as shown in Figure  8 (d). The two layers of <b>tie</b> <b>cables</b> are connected by some cables. Adding a layer of <b>tie</b> <b>cables</b> reduces the impact of frame vibrations on the membrane, but the cable mass and risk of deployment failure caused by cable windings will increase. Sakamoto et al. [69], performed response analysis of membrane structures to external low frequency disturbances. The results show that the multi-layer tensioning system enhanced the passive vibration isolation effect in the boundary layers. However, the optimal balance between the vibration isolation effect and cable mass was not considered in this paper.|$|R

50|$|At {{the start}} of construction, a {{temporary}} jetty {{was built on the}} south bank to enable the building of a cofferdam for the safe construction of the central pier.In April 2008, the supporting legs were added to the central pier.Steel falsework was constructed in the cofferdam by Dorman Longto support the ends of both incomplete arches as they cantilevered over the river during construction.The first steel arch, made from four pieces of fabricated steel welded together, was put in place in June 2008 and was later used to stabilise the cantilevering lower portions of the main arch using a strand-jack and <b>tie</b> <b>cable</b> between the top of the small arch and the large arch and then to reduce sway stress during the progressive construction of the large arch.The final section of the main arch came in four pieces which were welded together on site and on 5 September 2008 all 170 tonnes of it was lifted into place by a 1,500-tonne mobile crane, the largest in the country.The crane, a Gottwald AK680 owned by Sarens UK, is based in nearby Middlesbrough.The crane is 80 m high with a maximum of 1200 tonnes of superlift, requires 45 transport wagons to move it, and takes three days to set up using a 100-tonne crane.|$|E
30|$|The Miura–Natori {{tensioning}} system [66] was proposed by Koryo Miura and Michihiro Natori of the Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science (ISAS) in 1985, {{as shown in}} Figure  8 (b). The straight rectangular membrane edges without pockets are connected directly with tie cables, which are connected with outer cables. Both ends of the outer cables are tightened to the rectangular frame. This {{tensioning system}} could {{reduce the number of}} connection points between the frame and membrane, thus simplifying the frame design. However, the <b>tie</b> <b>cable</b> tension force will produce wrinkles at the membrane edges and the wrinkles will propagate {{to the middle of the}} membrane. Furthermore, so many tie cables will lead to cable winding, which will increase the risk of antenna deployment failure.|$|E

In the next, the electromagnetic performance is examined for this circular polarization. Beam squint occurs in this circularly polarized offset cable mesh reflector antenna. In the nominal state for RCP feed illumination, there exists a linear phase shift across the reflector aperture and the phase in the left side aperture region is lagging compared with the phase in the right side aperture region. The radiated left-hand circularly polarized (LCP) beam, which is launched from the RCP feed and reflected by this reflector, squints toward the right in xz plane and produces a negative squint angle.|$|E
40|$|PT. X {{is one of}} the {{companies}} located in Dumai Industrial Region, produces fertilizer. This company has three production plants. The production capacity of the first plant is 450 tons/day, the second plant produces 750 tons/day and the third plant produces 700 tons/day.   PT. X is supported by 2 sub companies, they are PT. A and PT. B. PT. A operates 5 bagging lines and PT. B operates 3 bagging lines. The fertilizer bagging process has three steps where each step has its own work station: putting the labeled sack to the hook followed by filling the sack with fertilizer, installing the <b>tie</b> <b>cable,</b> and sewing the fertilizer filled sack. From the initial survey, {{it was found that the}} processing time is not optimal to reach production target. PT. A and B have to set 24 working hours per day to run the target resulting on frequent over time, excessive fatigue and the negative impact of physically and mentally for the workers. Author’s hypothesis is the current condition has been one of the reasons for a decline of the production output. Therefore, the purposes of the research are to find the impact of current working hours and shift work pattern on the physical and psychological response of the workers and to calculate the standard time required to complete one cycle of bagging process. This standard time is very crucial to determine production target thus determine the optimal working hours and shift rotation. Measuring of heart rate are collecting results of a questionnaire of NASA-TLX are the parameters used to evaluate the physical and psychological response of workers. Two workers from different group worker, different shift work, from PT. A and PT. B were selected as samples to evaluate their heart rate pattern. The questioner spread out to all workers. Time standard was determined by observing and taking data of   40 bagging cycles for each shift work. The results show that shift work affecting the physiological response of workers in PT. B in the category between moderate to extreme especially for working element of arranging fertilizer sack to the pallet. This result was found for the two group workers. Frequent short rests between times are required to provide quick recovery for the workers and reduce excessive fatigue. Average standard time complete one bagging cycle was 0. 12 minutes and 0. 13 minutes for PT. A and PT. B, respectively. These standard times can be used to set the production output target for the two companies. Last, short rotation shift work with an additional number of workers is recommended for the shift pattern...|$|E

30|$|In 2003, Sakamoto et al. [67], {{from the}} University of Colorado, {{proposed}} the double tensioning system, {{as shown in}} Figure  8 (c). It is equivalent {{to a combination of}} the single and Miura–Natori tensioning systems. <b>Tie</b> <b>cables</b> are connected with both the inner cables in the pockets and the outer cables tightened to the frame. After comparing the single and double tensioning systems, Sakamoto et al. [68], pointed out that when applying the same stress on the membrane, the cable mass and tension force required for the double tensioning system are smaller, and the membrane is more resistant to wrinkling, but the risk of antenna deployment failure still exists because of cable winding. In this paper, the relationships between pocket parameters and membrane anti-wrinkle ability were not analyzed. In 2008, Guan et al. [49], from Zhejiang University, optimized the number of pockets, aiming at minimizing the force loaded to the frame, and revealed that odd numbers are better than even.
