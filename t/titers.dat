Currently the maximum reduction of fertility due to sperm vaccines in laboratory experiments with mice is ~75%. The lack of efficacy is due to variability of immunogenicity from one animal to another. Even when exposed to the same exact vaccine, some animals will produce abundant antibody <b>titers</b> to the vaccine's antigen, while others produce relatively low antibody <b>titers.</b> In the Eppin trial that attained 100% infertility, a small sample size (only 9 monkeys) was used, and even among this small sample 2 monkeys were dropped from the study because they failed to produce sufficiently high antibody <b>titers.</b>|$|E

Primary immunization consisted of 3 injections at 6 week intervals, and 148 women known to be previously fertile completed primary immunization. All women generated antibodies against hCG, but only 119 (80%) generated antibody <b>titers</b> clearly above 50ng/mL, which was the estimated level for efficacy.

40|$|A passive {{hemagglutination}} (PHA) {{test for}} measles was evaluated {{in comparison with}} hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and neutralization (NT) tests. The PHA test determines exclusively the level of antibody directed to the hemagglutinin protein of measles virus. The ratio of PHA to HI <b>titer</b> was 1 to 32 (geometric mean, 6. 5) for the first 5 weeks of infection but declined to near unity thereafter. It gradually increased again to 4 to 32 (geometric mean, 11. 7) over several years. The initial high PHA <b>titer</b> relative to the HI <b>titer</b> was most likely due {{to the presence of}} the immunoglobulin M antibody known to be efficient in agglutination, because 2 -mercaptoethanol (2 ME) treatment of sera reduced the PHA <b>titer</b> to a level {{similar to that of the}} HI <b>titer.</b> The PHA <b>titer</b> in sera obtained after the convalescent phase was insensitive to 2 ME, and the relative increase in the PHA over the HI <b>titer</b> was presumably a result of increased antibody avidity. In some individuals, the HI <b>titer</b> fell to below detectable levels several years after either natural infection or vaccination, but the PHA as well as the NT <b>titer</b> remained positive. The PHA <b>titer</b> was therefore a more reliable and more sensitive indicator of immune status against measles than the HI <b>titer.</b> The decrease in PHA <b>titer</b> by 2 ME treatment provided evidence of a current or very recent infection.

40|$|<b>Titer</b> {{estimation}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} components of immunoassay and vaccine development. A multiplexed in vitro opsonization assay (MOPA) is widely accepted to quantitate Streptococcus pneumococcal antibodies to serotype-specific pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide. <b>Titer</b> estimation of vaccine based on OPA is one important component of standardization of OPA, and the selected statistical method is a factor influencing the accuracy and precision of <b>titer</b> estimation. We evaluated five <b>titer</b> estimation methods for pneumococcal OPA in terms of precision and accuracy using three data sets generated by specifically designed experiments with both an eight-dilution and an eleven-dilution design. The bootstrap resampling technique was also used to determine the performance of the estimation. We concluded that the traditional direct method did not perform as well as the other four methods in terms of precision and accuracy of <b>titer</b> estimation. The Spearman-Kärber estimator might be biased upward for OPA <b>titer</b> estimation. The four-parameter logistic model (4 PL) method is an alternative choice for OPA <b>titer</b> estimation.

25|$|A vaccine induces active {{immunity}} when antigens are injected into {{an animal that}} cause it to produce desired antibodies itself. In passive immunity the desired antibody <b>titers</b> are achieved by injecting antibodies directly into an animal. The efficacy of such an approach for immunocontraception was demonstrated {{as early as the}} 1970s with antibodies against zonae pellucidae in mice during the investigation of the mechanism by which such antibodies inhibited fertility. Because the variability of individual immune response is an obstacle to bringing contraceptive vaccines to market, there has been research into the approach of contraception through passive immunization as an alternative that would be of less duration, but be closer to market. Research done using phage display technology on lymphocytes from immunoinfertile men led to the isolation, characterization, and synthesis of specific antibodies that inhibit fertility by acting against several of the known sperm antigens.

25|$|Anti-dsDNA {{antibodies}} {{are highly}} associated with glomerulonephritis in SLE, although some patients with high <b>titers</b> of anti-dsDNA antibodies do not develop renal disease. This {{is most likely}} {{due to the fact}} that anti-dsDNA are a heterogeneous population, some of which have been found not to be pathogenic. Anti-dsDNA antibodies can be present in normal individuals, however these antibodies are usually low avidity IgM isotype. In contrast, pathogenic anti-dsDNA antibodies found in SLE are usually of IgG isotype and show high avidity for dsDNA. One possible mechanism for anti-dsDNA and their role in nephritis is the formation of immune complexes that arise by indirect binding to DNA or nucleosomes that are adhered to the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Another mechanism is direct binding of antibodies to GBM antigens such as C1q, nucleosomal proteins, heparin sulphate or laminin, which can initiate an inflammatory response by activating complement. They can also be internalised by certain molecules on the GBM cells and cause inflammatory cascades, proliferation and alteration of cellular functions.|$|E
