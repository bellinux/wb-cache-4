It came about when Orson had {{an idea for a}} song. [...] They played it to us – it was just a verse and a bridge and we completely changed the format of the song to make it our own and the result is this incredibly provocative sexy number that we love." [...] She elaborated in a separate interview: [...] "When we started working with <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>from</b> Orson the sound just blew us away – it's completely fresh sounding {{but at the same time}} has the same qualities as the biggest songs of our career, so it's perfect for this album!" ...|$|E
500|$|Continuing his {{services}} from the prior season, Dana Gonzales oversaw {{production of the}} show's second season. The cinematographer took cues from William Eggleston to develop a retro visual palette. To achieve this quality, Gonzales relied on vintage practical lighting technology, and captured scenes with an Arri ALEXA camera, retrofitted with vintage Cooke lenses. In one section of Calgary where they were filming, production staff replaced each sodium-lamp street light with tungsten light bulbs, creating an ambience that [...] "pulls the audience into the world when the story takes place". Also, once Hawley analyzed the 1968 thriller film The Boston Strangler, split screen effects were employed to help streamline the narrative during transitions. Gonzales said: [...] "We felt that split-screen would be an incredible way to track all these characters and locations within the episode: Where's the Gerhardt family? Where are <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>from</b> Kansas City? Where's Peggy? Where's Ed?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for Fall Out Boy's [...] "Beat It" [...] was {{directed}} by Shane Drake and was made in homage to Jackson. [...] "I think when you're doing a Michael Jackson cover, there's this expectation that you're going to do one of his videos verbatim," [...] Stump said. [...] "What {{we decided to do}} was kind of inspired by Michael Jackson and the mythology of him. There are specific images that are reference points for us, but at any given point, it's not any of his videos. It's kind of all of his videos, all at once, but on a Fall Out Boy budget, so it's not quite as fancy." [...] The costumes for the video were similar to the originals. [...] "My costume is this take on one of <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>from</b> Michael Jackson's original 'Beat It' video, like, the guy who plays the rival dancer," [...] Wentz said during the filming of the video. The music video featured numerous cameos, including a karate class/dance session being taught by Tony Hale, Donald Faison and Joel David Moore dressed up like Michael Jackson. The short film later received a MTV Video Music Award nomination for Best Rock Video.|$|E

The mixtape's seventh track and second single from the tape [...] "Andre" [...] was also written by JoJo while {{production}} was handled by Mr. Franks. In discussion of the track, JoJo says [...] "Andre" [...] isn't necessarily a direct tribute to Outkast's André 3000; rather, the 37-year-old rapper/singer provided inspiration for the song. [...] "I absolutely admire André and both of <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>from</b> Outkast — their incredible artistry and creativity," [...] she explains. [...] "The man that André is, I think that's super-sexy — someone who is themselves, who isn't confined and just expresses themselves. He has such a great style. I was inspired by that, for sure." [...] The mixtape includes music from Dropkick Murphys' [...] "I'm Shipping Up to Boston" [...] on the [...] "St. Patrick's Day Interlude".|$|E
