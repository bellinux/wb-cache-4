50|$|The law in Hong Kong {{regarding}} {{comparative advertising}} {{is the law}} {{that existed in the}} UK prior to the enactment of the UK Act 1994. Hong Kong has no legislation exclusively intended at limiting false or misleading advertisements. Still, the Trade Descriptions Ordinance (Cap 362) bans the use of false trade descriptions in advertisements. The tort of <b>trade</b> <b>libel</b> also exists to deal with false or misleading advertisements designed to injure the competitor. Consumer Council may have the authority to publish information with a perspective to amending false or misleading advertisements, while the Association of Accredited Advertising Agencies of Hong Kong have the authority to take action against members who organize advertisements that are inaccurate.|$|E

Kaspersky defended itself by invoking the Communications Decency Act (CDA), saying it was immune from civil liability based on the paragraph of the CDA headed [...] "Protection for 'Good Samaritan' blocking and screening of offensive material". The judge agreed, granting Kasperky's motion for summary judgment. In 2008, Zango appealed against the ruling. As of April 2008, the National Business Coalition for E-Commerce and Privacy was supporting Zango in the appeal.

5000|$|Plaintiffs {{submitted}} that [...] "fictitious job listings" [...] by Kuperwicz on craiglist had defamed them. Pearlberg {{claimed that}} those postings were [...] "false {{statements to the}} public that SVA was seeking to replace" [...] her as SVA's Director of Human Resources. In addition to its allegation of defamation, SVA submitted that Kuprewicz [...] "committed the tort of trade libel." [...] The court, however, decided that [...] "the simple statement that Pearlberg's position was vacant" [...] could not [...] "reasonably construed as imputing professional unfitness or incompetence to Pearlberg" [...] and was not sufficient to [...] "constitute defamation." [...] Also, SVA's allegation of being defamed was not based on a convincing ground as [...] "the postings merely announced a job opening at SVA" [...] and could not [...] "be reasonably susceptible of any defamatory meanings." [...] Citing precedents, the court maintained that the assessment of defamatory meaning of particular statement is [...] "a legal question to be resolved by the court in the first instance." [...] In conducting such an assessment, [...] " [...] the words must be given a fair reading and must be construed {{in the context of the}} entire statements as a whole tested against the understanding of the average reader." [...] If the result shows that the words in question are not [...] "reasonably susceptible of a defamatory meaning, they are not actionable and cannot be made so by a strained or artificial construction". With reference to SVA's <b>trade</b> <b>libel</b> claim the court maintained that [...] "SVA must allege facts that Kuprewicz knowingly published false matter derogatory to SVA's business that was calculated to prevent other from dealing with SVA or interfering with SVA's relations with others, to its detriment." [...] Nevertheless, as there was not any [...] "false matter derogatory statement to SVA's business" [...] in those job listings, the court concluded that <b>trade</b> <b>libel</b> as a [...] "cause of action must also be dismissed." ...|$|E
5000|$|California {{and most}} jurisdictions hold {{that there is}} a {{privilege}} to compete for business. “Under the privilege of free competition, a competitor is free to divert business to himself as long as he uses fair and reasonable means. Thus, the plaintiff must present facts indicating the defendant’s interference is somehow wrongful—i.e., based on facts that take the defendant’s actions out of the realm of legitimate business transactions.” [...] "The competition privilege is defeated only where the defendant engages in unlawful or illegitimate means." [...] "Wrongful" [...] in this context means “independently wrongful”—that is, [...] "blameworthy" [...] or [...] " [...] independently wrongful apart from the interference itself." [...] This may be termed use of improper means. “Commonly included among improper means are actions which are independently actionable, violations of federal or state law or unethical business practices, e.g., violence, misrepresentation, unfounded litigation, defamation, <b>trade</b> <b>libel</b> or trade mark infringement.” Other examples of [...] "wrongful conduct" [...] are [...] "fraud, misrepresentation, intimidation, coercion, obstruction or molestation of the rival or his servants or workmen." ...|$|E
5000|$|Plaintiff's {{complaint}} enumerated six {{causes of}} action for [...] "false designation of origin under the Lanham Act, defamation and <b>trade</b> <b>libel,</b> violation of York Civil Rights Law §§ 50 - 51, trespass to chattels and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage." [...] Responding to [...] "plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunctive relief", Kuprewicz filed a motion [...] "to dismiss the complaint in its entirety for failure to state a cause of action." [...] The court maintained that determination of the latter motion is only possible after accepting [...] "as true {{all of the facts}} alleged in the complaint as well as all reasonable inferences that may be gleaned from those facts." [...] Then the court must decide whether [...] "assuming truth of the facts alleged, the complaint states the elements of a legally cognizable cause of action." [...] Consequently, if it finds the allegations as [...] "merely conclusory" [...] and without factual grounds, the court can dismiss the complaint due to its failure [...] "to state a cause of action." [...] Therefore, the court turned to each issue that had been raised in the complaint to see if that could establish a cause of action and finally concluded that [...] "the only viable cause of action pleaded in the complaint is defendant SVA's claim for common law trespass to chattels.", ...|$|E
