The recordings would normally be on tape, and then transferred to disc, although the tape was recorded over again during the next session. Because of trams, trucks, and horses {{going up and down}} Kensington, Phillips had to hang heavy blankets over the studio door and a rear window to minimise the noise. Phillips' first recording was of himself singing [...] "Bonnie Marie of Argyle", (unaccompanied) and a few days later he recorded [...] "Unchained Melody", with local dance band singer Betty Roy. The first disc he cut in the studio was on 7 August 1955, with his eight-year-old daughter, Carol, singing, [...] "Mr Sandman". All the discs had [...] "Play with a light-weight pick-up" [...] on the label, as this would increase the life of the disc, which would eventually wear out.|$|E

Martin drew on {{his experience as}} a producer of comedy records for Beyond the Fringe and The Goon Show, providing an array of zany sound effects to create the nautical atmosphere. On the second session the studio store cupboard was ransacked for special effects, which included chains, a ship's bell, tap dancing mats, whistles, hooters, waves, a <b>tin</b> <b>bath</b> filled with water, wind, and thunderstorm machines, as well as a cash register, which was later used on Pink Floyd's song [...] "Money" [...] (1973).|$|E

Drop the cable!", which was looped into the song afterwards; and Abbey Road employees John Skinner and Terry Condon twirled chains in a <b>tin</b> <b>bath</b> to create water sounds. After the line, [...] "and the band begins to play", Emerick found a recording of a brass band and changed it slightly so it could not be identified, although it is thought to be a recording of Georges Krier and Charles Helmer's composition, [...] "Le RÃªve Passe" [...] (1906). The original recording had a spoken intro by Starr, but the idea was abandoned on 3 June.|$|E

60|$|Camp was {{beginning}} the strenuous life now. Tent after tent emptied itself of its occupants, who stretched themselves vigorously, and proceeded towards the tubbing-ground, {{where there were}} <b>tin</b> <b>baths</b> for those who cared {{to wait until the}} same were vacant, and a good, honest pump for those who did not.

50|$|In 1939, {{pithead baths}} were {{installed}} at the mine; it meant miners no longer needed to walk home dirty and wet, risking illness.

During the Second World War, surface extraction of coal began at Blaenavon in November 1941 using equipment and skilled men from the Canadian Army.

60|$|After breakfast, as John {{was far too}} lame to walk {{about the}} farm, the fair Bessie {{suggested}} that he should come and help her to wash a batch of ostrich feathers, and, accordingly, off he went. The locus operandi was in a space of lawn {{at the rear of}} a little clump of naatche orange-trees, of which the fruit is like that of the Maltese orange, only larger. Here were placed an ordinary washing-tub half-filled with warm water, and a <b>tin</b> <b>bath</b> full of cold. The ostrich feathers, many of which were completely coated with red dirt, were plunged first into the tub of warm water, where John Niel scrubbed them with soap, and then transferred to the <b>tin</b> <b>bath,</b> where Bessie rinsed them and laid them on a sheet in the sun to dry. The morning was very pleasant, and John soon {{came to the conclusion that}} there are many more disagreeable occupations in the world than the washing of ostrich feathers with a lovely girl to help you. For there was no doubt but that Bessie was lovely, looking a very type of happy, healthy womanhood as she sat opposite to him on the little stool, her sleeves rolled up almost to the shoulder, showing a pair of arms that would not have disgraced a statue of Venus, and laughed and chatted away as she washed the feathers. Now, John Niel was not a susceptible man: he had gone through the fire years before and burnt his fingers like many another confiding youngster but, all the same, he did wonder as he knelt there and watched this fair girl, who somehow reminded him of a rich rosebud bursting into bloom, how long it would be possible to live in the same house with her without falling under the spell of her charm and beauty. Then he began to think of Jess, and of what a strange contrast the two were.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} part of Eve Hill, however, {{was still standing}} {{by the start of}} the 1960s, and by this stage most of the houses in the area were in an unfit condition with outdoor toilets, <b>tin</b> <b>baths,</b> and no electricity or running water. Dudley council decided to demolish the bulk of the older houses around Eve Hill in 1962, {{and by the end of}} the decade the landscape had altered drastically. The older houses had been levelled, with many families being rehoused on new council estates like Russells Hall, and the site had been redeveloped with three multi-storey blocks of council flats - Millfield Court, Prince of Wales Court, and Butterfield Court - being occupied by 1969. These tower blocks were 19, 19 and 16 storeys high respectively. A shopping parade including a butcher's shop and a Post Office were built in the shadow of Millfield Court.|$|R
40|$|For {{electroplating}} articles with {{a complex}} shape, {{it is essential}} that the plating bath should (1) cover the contoured surface in a short time and (2) produce a uniform thickness preferably over the entire surface or at least over the significant surfaces. The former is decided by the covering power of the bath and the latter by the 13; throwing power of the bath. Throwing power refers to the thickness distribution of the deposit, whereas covering power is concerned with the ability of the bath to cover the entire cathode surface in the least possible time, even in low current density areas. Though quantitative methods (Haring and Blum cell, Hull cell, etc.) are available for measuring the throwing power of the bath, there are no such methods for covering power. In our laboratory, we examined the feasibility of measuring the covering power of a <b>tin</b> plating <b>bath</b> with the help of 13; scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

Having a load of fifty pounds already, I ignored the suggestion that I might carry the bath, and hurried Leyland off before his spouse could further hamper us. One thick blanket, a kettle, and a few pounds of provisions would have amply sufficed, so a large-sized tent seemed to be distinctly superfluous, {{to say nothing of the}} bag filled with hair-brushes, towels, and scented soap.|$|E
60|$|The mysterious {{struggle}} {{was going on}} with confused thuds of bare feet, in a mute wrestling match, no human sound, hiss, groan, murmur, or exclamation coming through the curtain. A chair fell over, not with a crash but lightly, as if just grazed, and a faint metallic ring of the <b>tin</b> <b>bath</b> succeeded. Finally the tense silence, as of two adversaries locked in a deadly grip, was ended by the heavy, dull thump of a soft body flung against the inner partition of planks. It seemed to shake the whole bungalow. By that time, walking backward, his eyes, his very throat, strained with fearful excitement, his extended arm still pointing at the curtain, Wang had disappeared through the back door. Once out in the compound, he bolted round the end of the house. Emerging innocently between the two bungalows he lingered and lounged in the open, where anybody issuing from any of the dwellings was bound to see him--a self-possessed Chinaman idling there, with nothing but perhaps an unserved breakfast on his mind.|$|E

50|$|The village {{consists}} of several rows of terraced houses, {{along with a}} number of detached and semi-detached properties. The oldest existing properties are the former vicarage, the school house, three large detached houses on St. Cuthbert's Road, two stone-built cottages (accessed by a lane leading off to the north-east from St. Cuthbert's Road) and the five rows of houses which form Glamis Terrace, Cuthbert Street and Church Street. The majority of the properties on Cuthbert Street and Church street were built as two up-two downs, and at one time had outside toilets and <b>tin</b> <b>baths</b> which would have been placed in front of the fire. At some point the houses were modernised and had indoor bathroom/toilets installed. Some of the outside toilets with their adjoining coal houses remain, but a number have been demolished, or have had the toilet removed and are used as sheds. The houses on Glamis Terrace were intended for colliery officials, and are therefore fewer in number and considerably larger than the others, with gardens at both the front and rear. It is named Glamis because the Bowes-Lyons, the Earls of Strathmore, who were ancestors of the Queen (Glamis Castle was the childhood home of the Queen Mother) owned the colliery and the surrounding land, including the Gibside estate. Church Street and Cuthbert Street are named after St. Cuthbert's Church, which stands at the corner of St. Cuthbert's Road, opposite the former Miners Welfare Institute (now a community centre housing a nursery and a performing arts school) and the aged miner's cottages.|$|R

Casson described the third quadrangle as [...] "a long, narrow court with a jumble of nineteenth- and twentieth-century buildings trying a bit too hard to be interesting". The extension cost Â£13,656. It contained the college's science laboratories and a new gate-tower, as well as further living accommodation and a library for students, known as the Meyricke Library, after a major donorâ there had been an undergraduate library in the second quadrangle since 1865, known as the Meyricke Library from 1882 onwards.

As a result, studies investigating the effect of process variables on tin whisker formation are often conducted on brass substrates {{to take advantage of}} the increased whisker growth rates. Although it has been understood since the 1960 s that the increased whisker growth results from zinc diffusion, to date there has not been any detailed analysis of the zinc/zinc oxide distribution at the surface of the tin deposit. Using a commercial bright <b>tin</b> electroplating <b>bath,</b> the formation of zinc oxide at the surface of tin deposits on brass has been investigated. Analyses show that zinc oxide is present on the surface of the deposit within 1 day of electroplating. During storage at room temperature, a network of zinc oxide is formed at the surface grain boundaries, the extent of which increases with time. The critical role that zinc surface diffusion plays in whisker growth for tin deposits on brass has been demonstrated by electrochemical oxidation of the tin shortly after electroplating. This develops a tin oxide film that is thicker than the native air-formed oxide and subsequently serves as a diffusion barrier to zinc surface diffusion, thereby mitigating whisker growth...|$|R

However, the spontaneous growth of tin whiskers during service can be highly deleterious, resulting in localised electrical shorting or other harmful effects. The formation of tin whiskers, widely accepted as resulting from the formation of compressive stresses within the electrodeposit, has been responsible {{for a wide range of}} equipment failures in consumer products, safety critical industrial and aerospace based applications. The numbers of failures associated with tin whiskers is likely to increase in the future following legislation banning the use of lead in electronics, the latter when alloyed with tin, being an acknowledged tin whisker mitigator. Using a bright <b>tin</b> electroplating <b>bath,</b> the effect of process parameters on the characteristic structure of the deposit has been evaluated for deposition onto both brass and copper substrates. The effect on whisker growth rate of process variables, such as current density and deposit thickness, has been evaluated. In addition, the effect of pulse plating on subsequent whisker growth rates has also been investigated, particularly by varying duty cycle and pulse frequency. Whisker growth has been investigated under both ambient conditions and also using elevated temperature and humidity to accelerate the growth of whiskers. Studies have shown that whisker formation is strongly influenced by pulse plating parameters. Furthermore, increasing both current density and thickness of the deposit reduce whisker growth rates. It is also observed that whisker formation is greatly accelerated on brass substrates compared with copper. The basis for this observation is explained...|$|R
