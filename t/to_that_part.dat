5|$|Items of {{jewellery}} {{made before}} the death of Queen Victoria in 1901 are regarded as heirlooms owned by the Queen in right of the Crown and pass from one monarch to the next in perpetuity. Objects made later, including official gifts, can also be added <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> of the Royal Collection at the sole discretion of the monarch. It {{is not possible to}} say how much the collection is worth because the jewels have a rich and unique history, and they will likely never be sold on the open market.|$|E
5|$|The Church of St John the Baptist, {{known to}} the locals as Sveti Yani or Sveti Yan, is located on a high cliff on the western {{outskirts}} of Asenovgrad, which belong to the old town. To allow its construction, the terrain around its foundations had to be reinforced. The church lies close to several less ancient chapels, such as Saint Barbara's, Saint George's and Chapel of the Entry of the Most Holy Mother of God into the Temple. Nearby are also a 17th-century water fountain and remains of medieval fortifications which date to the 11th–13th century. Together, these buildings contribute <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> of Asenovgrad's medieval atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|From 1920 John Carson, {{also working}} for AT, {{began to develop}} a new way of looking at signals using the {{operational}} calculus of Heaviside which in essence is working in the frequency domain. This gave the AT engineers a new insight into the way their filters were working and led Otto Zobel to invent many improved forms. Carson and Zobel steadily demolished many of the old ideas. For instance the old telegraph engineers thought of the signal as being a single frequency and this idea persisted into the age of radio with some still believing that frequency modulation (FM) transmission could be achieved with a smaller bandwidth than the baseband signal right up until the publication of Carson's 1922 paper. Another advance concerned the nature of noise, Carson and Zobel (1923) treated noise as a random process with a continuous bandwidth, an idea that was well ahead of its time, and thus limited the amount of noise {{that it was possible to}} remove by filtering <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> of the noise spectrum which fell outside the passband. This too, was not generally accepted at first, notably being opposed by Edwin Armstrong (who ironically, actually succeeded in reducing noise with wide-band FM) and was only finally settled with the work of Harry Nyquist whose thermal noise power formula is well known today.|$|E

25|$|Agderfly's {{school program}} {{was based on}} that {{the first part of}} the theory was taken as {{correspondence}} and the second part at the school, a system that had been in place since 1977. The Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) reacted to this in 1990, stating that the correspondence system was not in line with regulations. They did not react <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> of the courses were taken as correspondence, but rather the amount of the material which followed this material. They therefore withdrew Agderfly's approval in 1990. This hindered them from taking up a grade of pupils, costing them in excess of NOK1 million.|$|E

Commander Tunis A. M. Craven either disregarded or forgot the instruction to stay to the east of the minefield, so he took his ship directly across. Almost immediately, a torpedo went off under her hull, and she filled with water and sank in two or three minutes. Only 21 of her crew of 114 were saved. Craven was among those lost, so he could not explain his decisions.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1846 the House family moved to Little Meadows, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, where they built a home {{on the side of}} a hill which was known as the Castle. There was a natural spring nearby, which was piped into the house to give running water, an unusual thing for those days. At that time there was no {{railroad}} <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> of the country, so in order to move their household goods from New York, they boarded a barge which was towed by steam up the Hudson River to Troy where it was taken through the lock into the Erie Canal and towed by horses to Ithaca on Lake Cayuga, New York. The last part of the trip was made by ox teams and the whole journey took over a month.|$|E

25|$|Other {{finds in}} the area, for example weapons and jewelry, {{show that the}} site was {{associated}} with the highest strata of society, possibly with the royal family. The entire complex, which also included workshops and a marketplace, may have functioned as a temporary residence for the king when he made periodic visits <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> of the kingdom. Investigations have shown that the complex was only in use for short periods. The king also functioned as a religious leader, and the hof was used for the feasts and blóts that were held when the king was at the location. Similar complexes of buildings are known from other places in southern Scandinavia, for example Järrestad in Scania, Lisbjerg in Jutland, and Toftegård on Zealand. These royal centers, called central places by archeologists, perhaps also constituted a parallel to the royal palaces of the Merovingian, Carolingian, and Holy Roman Emperors, such as Charlemagne's palace complex at Aachen. These also included religious buildings, marketplaces, and workshops that were primarily used when the peripatetic court was in residence.|$|E
25|$|Reconstruction of {{the main}} lanes and {{frontage}} roads to handle increased traffic began in 1982 just north of downtown. No lanes were added south of I-610, but the eight-lane cross section, with room for a transitway, was continued north as construction progressed. Work was completed south of Airline Drive (exit 53) in about 1985, to Shepherd Drive (exit 56B) in 1987, and to Farm to Market Road 525 (exit 60A) in 1990; this last opening allowed the transitway to extend to just south of FM 525. The Hardy Toll Road, completed on June 28, 1988 between I-610 and I-45 near The Woodlands, added capacity <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> of the corridor, and in 1990 reconstruction was completed on a short piece of I-45 from the toll road into The Woodlands. Reconstruction continued from FM 525, reaching Airtex Boulevard (exit 63) in 1997, including part of the Sam Houston Tollway interchange (completed in 2003) and a transitway extension, Cypresswood Drive (exit 68) in 1998, extending the transit way to its present terminus, and the Hardy Toll Road (exit 72) in 2003. Work on the section through The Woodlands to Research Forest Drive (exit 77) was completed in 2001, including a direct connection to Woodlands Parkway, and in 2003 work was completed to Farm to Market Road 1488 (exit 81). Construction is now complete between FM 1488 (Exit 81) to the Walker County line near milepost 100 {{just south of the}} northbound truck weigh station and New Waverly, near State Highway 75 (exit 98).|$|E

25|$|At this dire point, Gen. Jackson rode <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> of {{the field}} to rally the men and came upon his old brigade finally being brought up to {{reinforce}} the line. Intending to inspire the troops there, he attempted to brandish his sword; however, due to the infrequency with which he drew it, it had rusted in its scabbard and {{he was unable to}} dislodge it. Undaunted, he unbuckled the sword from his belt and waved it, scabbard and all, over his head. He then grabbed a battle flag from a retreating standard bearer and yelled at his men to rally around him. The Stonewall Brigade, heartened by their commander, launched into the Union troops and drove them back. By this point, Banks's men were becoming tired and disorganized, with their ammunition nearly gone. Without any support, his men had been unable to follow up on their initial success. In their zeal, the Stonewall Brigade pursued the Federals as they fell back, but soon found themselves beyond the Confederate line and without support. The Federals reformed and attacked, driving the 4th and 27th Virginia back. But the actions of the Stonewall Brigade gave the Confederate line time to reform and A.P Hill's troops to come up and fill the gaps from Winder's broken regiments. Jackson ordered Hill and Ewell to advance. He encountered Brig. Gen. Lawrence O'Bryan Branch (a career politician) making a lengthy speech to his troops, and urged him to press forward. The Union right immediately collapsed. Ewell, having difficulty silencing his guns, was delayed, but the Union left began to waver at the sight of Crawford's retreat and were finally broken by a charge down Cedar Mountain by Brig. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble's brigade.|$|E

500|$|In book II, {{dealing with}} {{dialectic}} and rhetoric, Isidore is heavily indebted to translations from the Greek by Boethius, and in book III he is similarly in debt to Cassiodorus, {{who provided the}} gist of Isidore's treatment of arithmetic. Caelius Aurelianus contributes generously <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> of book IV which deals with medicine.

Through Isidore's condensed paraphrase a third-hand memory of Roman law passed to the Early Middle Ages. Lactantius is the author most extensively quoted in book XI, concerning man. Books XII, XIII and XIV are largely based on Pliny the Elder's Natural History and Solinus; whilst the lost Prata of Suetonius, which can be partly pieced together from what is quoted in Etymologiae, seems to have inspired the general plan of the work, as well as many of its details.|$|E
