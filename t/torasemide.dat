Given orally for 5 days, <b>torasemide</b> was clinically very effective and well tolerated. On a weight basis, the diuretic, natriuretic and chloruretic effects of <b>torasemide</b> were about 8 -times greater than those of furosemide. However, the kaliuretic effect of <b>torasemide</b> was only 3 -times greater than that of furosemide, suggesting that <b>torasemide</b> is more potassium sparing than furosemide. <b>Torasemide</b> displayed a rapid onset of action, similar to that of furosemide but had a longer diuretic effect without any rebound phenomenon. <b>Torasemide</b> and furosemide did not effect creatinine clearance or uric acid excretion.

40|$|<b>Torasemide</b> is a loop {{diuretic}} {{used for the}} treatment of hypertension and for oedema in chronic heart failure (CHF), renal failure and cirrhosis. The efficacy of <b>torasemide</b> in reducing salt and water retention in CHF has been established in double-blind comparative studies against furosemide. <b>Torasemide</b> {{has been shown to be}} at least as effective as furosemide in terms of total volume of urine excreted and also has a longer duration of action. The efficacy of <b>torasemide</b> (in terms of improved CHF symptoms and reduced pulmonary congestion, oedema and bodyweight) has been shown in randomised controlled trials and confirmed in large postmarketing studies. In addition, data from postmarketing studies have shown that patients receiving <b>torasemide</b> had significantly reduced hospital admission rates compared with patients receiving furosemide. Pharmacoeconomic assessments of <b>torasemide</b> have focused on its effect in reducing hospitalisation. Hospitalisation costs due to CHF decreased by 86 % during the 11. 2 -month period of <b>torasemide</b> treatment, compared with the 6 -month period prior to treatment, in a US retrospective study assessing medical and pharmacy claims data. Overall, average monthly costs for patients decreased by 56. 6 % after 5. 1 months (from $US 1897. 28 to $US 823. 70 per patient per month; PPPM), and by 76 % after 11. 2 months (from $US 1944. 76 to $US 470. 76 PPPM) of <b>torasemide</b> treatment. In the furosemide group, average monthly costs for patients increased moderately from $US 227. 28 to $US 261. 18 PPPM after 12 months. Direct comparison of the <b>torasemide</b> and furosemide study groups was not possible because the group receiving <b>torasemide</b> had much higher healthcare resource use at baseline. Compared with furosemide, <b>torasemide</b> was associated with reduced rates of hospital admissions for CHF and/or cardiovascular causes in 3 studies, a retrospective analysis conducted in Germany, a prospective US study of patients enrolled from hospital admissions and a decision-analysis model. As a result, the direct costs of treatment for CHF or cardiovascular diseases for patients treated with <b>torasemide</b> were less than those with furosemide. However, in the US study, there was no statistically significant difference in hospital admissions for all causes and/or in overall direct medical costs, although the study was not powered to show this. In another US study of managed care patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III CHF, no difference in clinical or economic outcomes was observed between patients taking <b>torasemide</b> or furosemide; despite the higher acquisition costs for <b>torasemide,</b> total costs were similar for both groups. <b>Torasemide</b> was found to be more cost effective than furosemide in terms of cost per patient with improved functional (NYHA) class of CHF severity in a retrospective German analysis, although this measure is not ideal. This study also evaluated indirect costs (for loss of productivity of employed patients) and results suggest <b>torasemide</b> has a favourable effect in reducing days off work compared with furosemide, although the population of employed patients in the study was very small. <b>Torasemide</b> has been shown to improve some measures of quality of life in 2 studies. It was associated with higher quality-of-life scores than furosemide in a 6 -month study, but the differences were only significant at month 4. In another study, <b>torasemide</b> significantly improved fatigue, but full study details are yet to be published. Conclusions: Despite the higher acquisition cost of <b>torasemide</b> over furosemide, pharmacoeconomic analyses have shown that <b>torasemide</b> is likely to reduce overall treatment costs of CHF by reducing hospital admissions and readmissions. <b>Torasemide</b> has generally shown clinical and economic advantages over furosemide, although more long term data are needed to confirm these results and to further investigate effects on quality of life. There are limitations to the currently available pharmacoeconomic data, but present data support the use of <b>torasemide</b> as a first-line option for diuretic therapy in patients with CHF presenting with oedema and especially in those patients not achieving relief of symptoms with furosemide.

AIMS: The objective of the <b>TOrasemide</b> In Congestive Heart Failure (TORIC) Study {{was to investigate the}} safety, tolerability and efficacy of <b>torasemide</b> in CHF patients compared to furosemide or other diuretics in an open-label, non-randomised, post-marketing surveillance trial. METHODS: The present analysis shows the findings of 1377 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-III CHF who received diuretic therapy with <b>torasemide</b> 10 mg/day orally (n= 778) vs. patients who received furosemide 40 mg/day orally (n= 527) or other diuretics (n= 72) on top of their existing standard CHF therapy for 12 months. Besides safety and tolerability, efficacy was assessed by documentation of mortality, morbidity, functional class and serum potassium levels every 3 months. RESULTS: TORIC confirmed the safety and tolerability of <b>torasemide</b> in CHF patients. Mortality was significantly lower in the <b>torasemide</b> (n= 17, 2. 2 %) than in the furosemide/other diuretics group (n= 27, 4. 5 %) (P< 0. 05). Functional improvement as assessed by NYHA class was observed in more patients who received furosemide <b>torasemide</b> (n= 356, 45. 8 %) than those who received furosemide/other diuretics (n= 223, 37. 2 %) (P= 0. 00017).

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} direct {{healthcare}} costs {{of patients with}} congestive heart failure (CHF) prescribed <b>torasemide</b> (torsemide) or furosemide (frusemide). Design and setting: As part of a prospective, randomised, nonblind study, we assessed the effects of <b>torasemide</b> and furosemide on readmission to hospital in 193 patients treated for CHF at a US urban public healthcare system. We also calculated total direct healthcare costs for the 2 drugs. The perspective of the analysis {{was that of the}} healthcare system. Healthcare charge and utilisation data, demographic information, and health status data were obtained from an electronic database containing data for all patients treated within the healthcare system. Patients and participants: Upon admission to the hospital, patients were eligible if they had evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction, were at least 18 years old, and were receiving furosemide. Intervention: Inpatients were randomised to either <b>torasemide</b> or furosemide treatment for 1 year. Main outcome measures and results: Patients treated with <b>torasemide</b> had fewer hospital admissions than those treated with furosemide [18 vs 34 % for CHF (p = 0. 013) and 38 vs 58 % for any cardiovascular cause (p = 0. 005) ]. In the <b>torasemide</b> group, expected annual hospital costs per patient were lower for CHF admissions (by $US 1054; 1998 values) and for all cardiovascular admissions (by $US 1545) than in the furosemide group. Because the annual acquisition cost of <b>torasemide</b> was $US 518 per patient higher than that of furosemide, the resulting net cost saving per patient was $US 536 for CHF and $US 1027 for all cardiovascular causes. Outpatient costs did not differ between treatment groups regardless of whether drug costs were considered. Total direct costs were $US 2124 lower with <b>torasemide</b> than with furosemide (not statistically significant). Conclusions: Owing largely to reduced readmission to the hospital, the cost of inpatient care for patients with CHF is significantly lower with <b>torasemide</b> than with furosemide, despite the higher acquisition cost of <b>torasemide.</b> Treatment with <b>torasemide</b> resulted in a nonsignificant reduction in total direct costs (outpatient plus inpatient) compared with furosemide.

The effects of <b>torasemide</b> and furosemide on cell growth induced by angiotensin II (Ang II) were investigated in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) obtained from the aorta of adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). METHODS: Cell growth was determined by DNA and protein synthesis as measured by [3 H]thymidine and [3 H]leucine incorporation, respectively. Proliferation of VSMCs was measured using a non-radioactive colorimetric cell proliferation assay. RESULTS: Ang II (10 (- 7) M) signficantly increased DNA and protein synthesis and cell proliferation in VSMCS: These effects were completely abolished by the Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist irbesartan (10 (- 6) M).

The stimulatory effect of [Ca(2 +) ](i) induced by a submaximal concentration of Ang II (10 (- 7) mol/L) was blocked by <b>torasemide</b> (IC(50) = 0. 5 +/- 0. 3 nmol/L). Our findings suggest that <b>torasemide</b> blocks the vasoconstrictor action of Ang II in vitro. This action can be related to the ability of <b>torasemide</b> to block the increase of [Ca(2 +) ](i) induced by Ang II in VSMCs.

To study {{effect of}} {{diuretic}} therapy with furosemide and <b>torasemide</b> on {{heart rate variability}} (HRV) and frequency of ventriclar rhythm disorders in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) complicating ischemic heart disease (IHD). Material and methods. Patients (n= 107) with CHF III-IV functional class (NYHA) complicating IHD were examined. The first group of patients received furosemide, 20 - 60 mg QD (n= 52), the second group received <b>torasemide,</b> 5 - 20 mg QD (n= 55). Analysis of heart rhythm disorders and the basic HRV indicators was performed by ECG 10 -minute recordings initially and after 10 days of therapy. Results. Decrease in time and spectral HRV parameters and increase in daily number of ventricular extrasystoles was found in furosemide treated patients. Improvement of HRV parameters and reduction of daily number of ventricular rhythm disorders was found <b>torasemide</b> treated patients.

40|$|Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} {{drugs have}} been shown to decrease the natriuretic response to loop diuretics in many but not all studies. Recently, indomethacin was shown not to affect the natriuretic response to the new loop diuretic <b>torasemide</b> in healthy volunteers. Inasmuch as sodium balance has been reported to modify the effect of indomethacin on furosemide-induced natriuresis in dogs, we investigated the effect of indomethacin, under two sodium balances (50 and 150 mEq/day), on the natriuretic response to two doses of <b>torasemide</b> in six healthy volunteers. Under the low sodium diet, indomethacin reduced the natriuretic response to <b>torasemide</b> like that to furosemide. In contrast, on the normal sodium diet, indomethacin failed to affect the natriuretic response to <b>torasemide.</b> Indomethacin reduced base-line and diuretic-induced increase in plasma renin activity, plasma angiotensin II levels and urinary excretion of prostaglandin 6 -keto F 1 alpha to a similar extent under the two sodium diets. Our data show that indomethacin reduces the natriuretic response to <b>torasemide</b> in humans. Dietary sodium restriction is a significant determinant of the interaction between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and loop diuretics in healthy volunteers, presumably because it allows loop diuretics to provoke an increase in renal blood flow which participates in their natriuretic action and is blocked by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{intravenous}} (i. v.) <b>torasemide</b> on diuresis and renal function was evaluated in {{three groups of}} normoxemic, 5 - to 10 -day-old, newborn New Zealand White rabbits. The animals of group 1 received 0. 2 mg/kg of <b>torasemide</b> i. v., whereas in group 2 an i. v. dose of 1. 0 mg/kg was given. The third group of animals received a bolus i. v. dose of 1. 0 mg/kg <b>torasemide</b> with continuous i. v. replacement of estimated urinary fluid and electrolyte losses. <b>Torasemide</b> {{proved to be an}} effective, potassium-sparing diuretic, without significant effect on glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Renal blood flow (RBF) fell and the renal vascular resistance (RVR) rose in all three groups of animals, although the rise in RVR in group 3 was not significant. These changes in renal hemodynamics were most pronounced in the animals of group 2 and are probably secondary to torasemide-induced hypovolemia (2. 8 % loss of body weight) and accompanying humoral reactions, such as an increase in angiotensin II (not measured). When the latter is prevented by simultaneous re-infusion of an electrolyte solution (group 3), replacing urinary losses, GFR increases and the changes in RBF and RVR are blunted. We conclude that <b>torasemide</b> is an effective, potassium-sparing diuretic in newborn rabbits. No evidence was found for a vasodilatory action of the drug...|$|E
40|$|The {{safety and}} {{diuretic}} activity of <b>torasemide</b> (1 -isopropyl- 3 - ([4 -(3 -methyl-phenylamino) pyridine]- 3 -sulfonyl) urea) were investigated in a phase I single-blind clinical study. After a pretreatment control day on placebo, a single dose of <b>torasemide</b> was administered orally {{according to an}} escalating dosage of 2. 5, 5, 10 and 20 mg, respectively, in 4 groups of 3 healthy young male volunteers, after an overnight fast and 1 h before breakfast. The peak stimulatory effect on urinary volume was observed within 1 to 2 h and {{was followed by a}} gradual decline at the 3 rd or 4 th h back to or even slightly below the corresponding control values. Thus, the duration of action averaged 3 - 4 h and only moderate rebound effects were detected. This time-related diuretic activity perfectly fitted with the pharmacokinetics data since <b>torasemide</b> plasma levels peaked at the 1 st h after drug administration and thereafter rapidly fell to less than 10 % of the maximal plasma concentrations after the 4 th h. While 2. 5 mg <b>torasemide</b> showed only minor diuretic action, urinary volume and urinary excretion of sodium, chloride and calcium increased linearly with the logarithm of the dose during the first 4 h as well as during the whole 24 h period with 5, 10 and 20 mg <b>torasemide.</b> Conversely, the urinary density and osmolality fell progressively as the dose of <b>torasemide</b> increased. There was a trend towards a moderate decrease in urinary excretion of uric acid which seemed independent of the dose given.

40|$|<b>Torasemide</b> {{is a new}} loop {{diuretic}} with a longer half-life and longer action than furosemide in healthy subjects. In order to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects, single oral doses of furosemide (80 mg) and <b>torasemide</b> (20 mg), which were equipotent in healthy subjects, were given to 14 patients with cirrhosis and ascites. Before the study patients underwent an equilibration period of 4 days without diuretics. The drugs were alternated following a randomized double-blind cross-over design after a wash-out period of at least 2 days. Urine was collected at defined intervals for 24 h after drug administration and blood samples were taken before, 6 h and 24 h after medication. <b>Torasemide</b> induced greater cumulative 24 h diuresis (2863 ± 343 vs. 2111 ± 184 ml, p < 0. 01) than furosemide. <b>Torasemide</b> {{did not differ from}} furosemide for cumulative 0 – 6 h sodium excretion (96 ± 17 vs. 92 ± 23 mmol sodium) but caused a more pronounced cumulative 6 – 24 h natriuresis (38 ± 11 vs. 17 ± 4 mmol, p < 0. 05). Five patients exhibited a weak response to furosemide (0 – 36 mmol sodium/ 24 h, median 24 mmol; 690 – 1460 ml urinary volume/ 24 h, median 1325 ml). These patients showed significantly higher natriuresis and diuresis following <b>torasemide</b> (26 – 136 mmol sodium/ 24 h, median 78 mmol, p < 0. 05; 1670 – 3610 ml urinary volume/ 24 h, median 2200 ml, p < 0. 05). Twenty-four hours after administration of both drugs there were no significant changes in hemodynamic, renal or hormonal parameters. No adverse effects were noted with either treatment. These findings suggest that <b>torasemide</b> might be more advantageous than furosemide in the treatment of ascites due to cirrhosis. ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Experimental {{data have}} {{demonstrated}} that <b>torasemide</b> but not furo-semide reduces the angiotensin-II-depending vasoconstriction and the angiotensin-II-depending proliferation of vascular myocytes. In addition it was shown that both loop diuretics inhibit the endothelin- 1 -depending vasoconstriction. Endothelin- 1 as well as angiotensin II has a central importance {{in the development of}} pulmonary hyper-tension. This study investigates if there are measurable differences between furosemide and <b>torasemide</b> according to the plasma-levels of both mediators and according to the parameters of pulmonary and global hemodynamics of patients with post capillary pulmonary hypertension after cardiac surgery in a double blind and randomized trial. Methods: 29 patients were enrolled in this study after approval of the ethics committee. 8 had to be excluded from the study so that we included 10 patients in the torasemide- and 11 patients in the furosemide-group. The study-medication was given orally at the first day after surgery. The plasma-levels of angiotensin II and endothelin- 1 were ana-lysed before and 60 minutes after oral administration, hemodynamic parameters (mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, right ventricular ejec-tion fraction, mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, central venous pressure, heart rate) were documented simultaneously. All data were expressed as median and quartiles. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for intergroup analysis. Intragroup analysis was performed with Wilcoxon rank-sum and Friedman’s test. Results: Furosemide increased significantly arterial angiotensin-II-levels compared with the <b>torasemide</b> group, p= 0, 009. There were no differences according to the endothelin- 1 -levels. <b>Torasemide</b> increased significantly the cardiac output in comparison to furosemide, p= 0, 021. Both differences did not exist before oral administration. Conclusion: Corresponding to experimental data, furosemide increased significantly arterial angiotensin-II-levels compared to <b>torasemide.</b> A possible explanation could be the different influence on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system of loop diuretics, which is described in man, too. Since there are no concurrent statements regarding to the influence of loop diuretics to this system in man, this study should give cause for further investigation of the effects of <b>torasemide</b> and furosemide in patients with post capillary pulmonary hypertension, especially concerning the described significant in-crease of cardiac output by <b>torasemide...</b>|$|E
