5|$|Bred {{primarily}} as hunting dogs, <b>their</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> {{to find the}} bird, send it {{into the air and}} then to retrieve it on command after the hunter has shot the quarry. The Russian Spaniel is suited for hunting in marshland, fields, woodland, for birds as well as rabbits and other small game. The breed is also popular in their native Russia as their small size makes them suitable to be kept in busy cities, and easily transported to hunting sites.|$|E

Meanwhile, Roxas, Sora's Nobody, is trapped in a virtual simulation of Twilight Town, created by DiZ to merge Roxas with his original self to restore Sora's power. DiZ's plans are threatened when Nobodies led by Axel, Roxas's former friend in Organization XIII, infiltrate the virtual town. However, Roxas is able to repel the Nobodies and finally merges with Sora. Sora, Donald, and Goofy wake up in the real Twilight Town and meet King Mickey and Yen Sid, who send them on another journey. <b>Their</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to find Riku and figure out the plans of Organization XIII, who control the Nobodies—the empty shell left over when a person with a strong heart is turned into a Heartless.

25|$|Snowflake schemas, in {{contrast}} to flat single table dimensions, have been heavily criticised. <b>Their</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> assumed to be an efficient and compact storage of normalised data but this is at the significant cost of poor performance when browsing the joins required in this dimension.

25|$|Benedict XV {{recalled}} the great Apostles of the Gospel who contributed {{much to the}} expansion of missions. He reviewed the recent history of the missions and stated so as the purpose of the apostolic letter. The encyclical first turned to the bishops and superiors in charge of the Catholic missions, noting the need to train local clergy. Catholic missionaries today continue to be reminded that <b>their</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> a spiritual one which must be carried out in a selfless way.|$|E
25|$|More recent {{excavations}} {{focused on}} an area {{believed to have}} held paper mulberry trees; Jefferson planted two rows {{in order to help}} create naturalistic wings to complement the Palladian style of his retreat house. Archaeologists at Poplar Forest found stains in the ground indicating areas in which trees were previously planted, and <b>their</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to analyze the levels of charcoal and pollen to determine which areas were most likely the original location(s) for the paper mulberry trees. Other ongoing and future excavation plans include the area surrounding an antebellum slave cabin as well as Jefferson’s ornamental plant nursery.|$|E
25|$|Student clubs, groups, and {{organizations}} {{are run by}} the student body. Student groups include the Commentator (a student newspaper) and the Yeshiva University Dramatics Society (YCDS) that puts on a performance each semester. A student-run group known as the Heights Initiative sponsors several outreach programs that work with the schools {{and organizations}} of the Washington Heights community.

25|$|The ICR {{attracted}} much opposition when {{it sought}} approval in Texas {{to operate a}} master's degree program in science education. An April 2008 survey by Texas Freedom Network showed the majority of science faculties in Texas are opposed to ICR's request to issue science degrees with 185 (95% of respondents) opposed to certifying the program and 6 (3%) in favor. Officials of the institute state <b>their</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to integrate Biblical creationism with science. Since their program is intended to prepare students who are or will become teachers, the developing program is controversial. In public statements ICR officials say that scientific literacy will be emphasized, but science advocates critical of the ICR say the institute's true goal is to restore religious creationism to science classes in the public schools.|$|E
500|$|The primary antagonists of {{the game}} are Saturos and Menardi, a pair of immensely {{powerful}} and talented Mars Adepts of a foreign race hailing from Prox, a town in Weyard's frigid north. <b>Their</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to restore Alchemy to the world, and they are assisted by the powerful and mysterious Mercury ...|$|E

Finkelstein stated that the BDS movement has had very few successes, and that just like a cult, the leaders pretend that they are hugely successful when in reality the general public rejects their extreme views.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the game, the player's score is set to the value of 50; <b>their</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to {{increase}} it as much as possible, for the maximum score of 307. This is done by performing certain actions, finding new areas, solving puzzles, and by finding and keeping treasures and valuable items. In exchange for some of their score, the player can receive hints or get resurrected following an in-game death. The player is ranked in accordance with their score: they start as a [...] "clumsy rookie", and eventually become an [...] "expert on Småland houses". Upon finishing the game, the player gets inducted into the cottage council.|$|E
500|$|The Subspace Army are the antagonists of Super Smash Bros. Brawl, {{appearing}} in The Subspace Emissary {{and led by}} the Ancient Minister. <b>Their</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to bring the entire world to Subspace piece by piece with devices called Subspace bombs (detonated {{with the aid of}} two R.O.B.s, requires 3 minutes of waiting time). The Sandbag appears in the [...] "Home-Run Contest" [...] minigame since Super Smash Bros. Melee. The object is to strike it as far as possible with either a Home-Run Bat or a fighting move. Sandbag also appears randomly as an item that drops other items when hit in various other modes in Brawl.|$|E
500|$|Further {{warning against}} [...] "political {{cannibalism}} between independentists", the Macheteros told their counterparts {{that it was}} their [...] "obligation {{to be at the}} forefront of every manifestation and protest" [...] against the Fortuño administration. After citing that their call for unity was a response to those times, the EBP expressed concern at the possibility of forcing a general strike without a tactical plan capable of replacing any protestors that may be incarcerated or killed and a list of demands. The organization also distanced itself from pro-independence organizations that have expressed their belief that more visibility in international organizations means that <b>their</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> closer than ever before, stating that [...] " [...] must show [...] how far [...] are willing to go". The EBP also criticized independence supporters that cooperate with the free association movement in some converging points, since despite seeking a non-territorial resolution to the status issue the soberanistas do not pursue or believe in independence. Despite this assessment, the Macheteros called for a truce that would unite the left, citing that in the vigils organized by the PRTP and them through the Coordinadora Nacional de las Vigilias por la Dignidad Filiberto Ojeda Ríos the 23rd day of every months are attended by people from all of the independentist spectrum.|$|E

500|$|The ballet {{is about}} a peasant girl named Giselle, who dies of a broken heart after {{discovering}} her lover is betrothed to another. The Wilis, a group of supernatural women who dance men to death, summon Giselle from her grave. They target her lover for death, but Giselle's great love frees him from their grasp. The Wilis [...] are particularly haunting characters. They are the spirits of virgin girls that died before they married. These creatures were very popular in Romantic era ballets. Led by Myrtha, the Queen of the Wilis, they gain their power in numbers as they effortlessly move through dramatic patterns and synchronized movements, and control the stage with their long tulle dresses and stoic expressions. Although still appearing ethereal, watching the Wilis sweep the stage creates an eerie mood that builds as the ballet continues and they enclose on Albrecht. They are ruthless and hateful of men because they have all died of a broken heart. Giselle finds forgiveness in her heart for Albrecht, but she knows the Wilis will not do the same. <b>Their</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> clear and they are relentless on their quest. The Wilis {{are one of the}} most iconic characters in Giselle. They leave an imprint in the viewers mind as they dominate the second act.|$|E

50|$|The authors {{acknowledged}} their thesis was {{controversial and}} emphasized that <b>their</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> not to justify slavery. Rather, they asserted, <b>their</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> to counter myths {{about the character}} of black Americans - myths they said had gained currency in the antebellum slavery debate and had survived into the civil rights era. These myths, the authors wrote, had their genesis in racist attitudes widely shared by both abolitionists and defenders of slavery. Myths included perceptions that black Americans were lazy, promiscuous, untrustworthy and lacked natural ability.|$|R
