In general it is considered preferable for parish priests to be married as they often act as counsel to married couples and thus can draw on <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience.</b> Unmarried priests usually are monks and live in monasteries, though there are occasions when, {{because of a lack}} of married priests, a monk-priest is temporarily assigned to a parish.|$|E

25|$|Members of the corvid {{family have}} been known to watch other birds, {{remember}} where they hide their food, then return once the owner leaves. Corvids also move their food around between hiding places to avoid thievery, but only if they have previously been thieves themselves (that is, they remember previous relevant social contexts, use <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> of having been a thief to predict the behavior of a pilferer, and can determine the safest course to protect their caches from being pilfered).

Gramsci saw Marxism as a marriage of the purely intellectual critique of religion found in Renaissance humanism and the elements of the Reformation that had appealed to the masses.

25|$|Back when Tokyo Babylon started serialization, Clamp {{was also}} writing RG Veda on the monthly {{magazine}} Wings. While {{the authors found}} this complicated, the series' quarterly publication of sixty pages resulted in the authors making several changes; The length of each chapter made the authors write a darker story {{in contrast to the}} original plans for a soft one. Based on <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> in Tokyo, Clamp incorporated dark social themes making the series realistic despite its focus on occultism. Ohkawa believes their young age when writing the manga also influenced most of the series' negative messages. Although when the series started the ending was already planned, {{it was not until the}} Tokyo Tower chapter that Clamp set the general atmosphere with the pilot being perceived as a comedy. The next chapter involving Subaru's past meeting with a man later revealed as Seishirō then set the events from the series' future.|$|E
25|$|Magpies {{have been}} {{observed}} engaging in elaborate social rituals, possibly including the expression of grief. Mirror self-recognition has been demonstrated in European magpies, making them one of but a few species and the only non-mammal known to possess this capability. The cognitive abilities of the Eurasian magpie are regarded as evidence that intelligence evolved independently in both corvids and primates. This is indicated by tool use, an ability to hide and store food across seasons, episodic memory, using <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> to predict the behavior of conspecifics. Another behavior exhibiting intelligence is cutting their food in correctly sized proportions for {{the size of their}} young. In captivity, magpies {{have been observed}} counting up to get food, imitating human voices, and regularly using tools to clean their own cages. In the wild, they organise themselves into gangs and use complex strategies hunting other birds and when confronted by predators.|$|E
25|$|The {{notion of}} {{evidence}} based practice {{has also had}} an influence {{in the field of}} education. Here, some commentators have suggested that the putative lack of any conspicuous progress is attributable to practice resting in the unconnected and noncumulative experience of thousands of individual teachers, each re-inventing the wheel and failing to learn from hard scientific evidence about 'what works'. Opponents of this view argue that hard scientific evidence is a misnomer in education; knowing that a drug works (in medicine) is entirely different from knowing that a teaching method works, for the latter will depend on a host of factors, not least those to do with the style, personality and beliefs of the teacher and the needs of the particular children (Hammersley 2013). Some opponents of EBP in education suggest that teachers need to develop their own personal practice, dependent on personal knowledge garnered through <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience.</b> Others argue that this must be combined with research evidence, but without the latter being treated as a privileged source.|$|E

500|$|The {{opening of}} East European orphanages {{in the early}} 1990s {{following}} the end of the Cold War provided substantial opportunities for research on attachment and other aspects of institutional rearing, however such research rarely mentions [...] "maternal deprivation" [...] other than in a historical context. Maternal deprivation as a discrete syndrome is a concept that is rarely used other than in connection with extreme deprivation and failure to thrive. Rather there is consideration of a range of different lacks and deficiencies in different forms of care, or lack of care, of which attachment is only one aspect, as well as consideration of constitutional and genetic factors in determining developmental outcome. Subsequent studies have however confirmed Bowlby's concept of [...] "cycles of disadvantage" [...] although not all children from unhappy homes reproduce the deficiencies in <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience.</b> Rather, it is now conceptualised as a series of pathways through childhood and a number of varied influences will determine which path a particular child takes.|$|E

[...] When Square Co. suggested a non-human player character, developers created Frog by adapting one of Toriyama's sketches. The team created the End of Time to help players with hints, worrying that they might become stuck and need to consult a walkthrough. The game's testers had previously complained that Chrono Trigger was too difficult; as Horii explained, [...] "It's because we know too much. The developers think the game's just right; that they're being too soft. They're thinking from <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience.</b> The puzzles were the same. Lots of players didn't figure out things we thought they'd get easily." [...] Sakaguchi later cited the unusual desire of beta testers to play the game a second time or [...] "travel through time again" [...] as an affirmation of the New Game + feature: [...] "Wherever we could, we tried to make it so that a slight change in your behavior caused subtle differences in people's reactions, even down to the smallest details... I think the second playthrough will hold a whole new interest." [...] The game's reuse of locations due to time traveling made bug-fixing difficult, as corrections would cause unintended consequences in other eras.|$|E

500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on November 29, 1910. One advertisement stated that an alternate title for the film was The Castaway Finds the Hidden Treasure, but this may be in error. The film had a wide national release, advertising theaters are known in Kansas, Texas, South Dakota, Vermont, and Missouri. The film was met with positive reviews by bothThe Moving Picture World and The New York Dramatic Mirror. The reviewer for the World highlighted that novelty of the subject, having the child being pawned only to be reclaimed by the father. Despite the novelty of the plot, the reviewer stated, [...] "While the play attracts because of this novelty, it still has dramatic interest, dramatic because it tells a life story in a simple way. Such stories are the most interesting since there are numerous persons who see it that can duplicate it either in <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> or the experience {{of some of their}} friends or acquaintances." [...] The reviewer for the Mirror was critical of the film, stating the plot was improbable, but it was well-acted. The only fault identified by the reviewer was the improper depiction of the poor, for the mother could not keep her child, but kept her maid. The reviewer also noted that the maid also did not age after the apparent ten year time-skip.|$|E
