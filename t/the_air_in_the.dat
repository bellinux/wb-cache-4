5|$|Though Boston College {{lost the}} game on the scoreboard, it won almost every {{statistical}} category. Quarterback Matt Ryan outperformed both Hokie quarterbacks combined in passing yardage, throwing for 305yards. Ryan was extremely accurate through <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fourth quarter, throwing eight straight complete passes, an ACC Championship Game record. Ryan also was surprisingly successful on the ground, rushing for Boston College's touchdown of the gamea 14-yard sprint {{in the second quarter}} that put Boston College ahead 167.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} intended that the electrical {{supply to the}} line and stations would be provided by a dedicated generating station at St George's Road, Southwark. This idea was abandoned in 1902 and electricity was instead provided by Lots Road Power Station, operated by the UERL. Six ventilation fans were installed along the line to draw 18,500 cubic feet per minute through the tunnels and out through exhausts placed {{on the roof of}} the stations. Fresh air was drawn back down from the surface via the lift and staircase shafts, thus replenishing <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tunnels. To reduce the risk of fire, the station platforms were built of concrete and iron and the sleepers were made from the fireproof Australian wood Eucalyptus marginata or jarrah.|$|E
5|$|Kesselring's memoirs were {{published}} in 1953, as Soldat bis zum letzten Tag (A Soldier to the Last Day). They were reprinted in English as A Soldier's Record a year later. Although written {{while he was in}} prison, without access to his papers, the memoirs formed a valuable resource, informing military historians on topics such as the background to the invasion of the Soviet Union. When the English edition was published, Kesselring's contentions that the Luftwaffe was not defeated in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Britain and that Operation Sea Lion—the invasion of Britain—was thought about but never seriously planned were controversial. In 1955, he published a second book, Gedanken zum Zweiten Weltkrieg (Thoughts on the Second World War).|$|E

50|$|Normally, <b>the</b> <b>air</b> {{pressure}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{ear canal}} {{is the same}} as ambient pressure. Also, under normal conditions, <b>the</b> <b>air</b> pressure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle ear is approximately the same as ambient pressure since the eustachian tube opens periodically to ventilate the middle ear and to equalize pressure. In a healthy individual, the maximum sound is transmitted through the middle ear when <b>the</b> ambient <b>air</b> pressure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ear canal is equal to <b>the</b> pressure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle ear.|$|R

5|$|Lesions can be transverse, {{occurring}} {{between the}} rings of the trachea, longitudinal or spiral. They may occur along the membranous {{part of the}} trachea, the main bronchi, or both. In 8% of ruptures, lesions are complex, occurring {{in more than one}} location, with more than one type of lesion, or on both of the main bronchi and the trachea. Transverse tears are more common than longitudinal or complex ones. The laceration may completely transect the airway or it may go only partway around. Partial tears that do not go {{all the way around the}} circumference of the airway do not allow a lacerated airway to become completely detached; tears that encircle the whole airway can allow separation to occur. Lacerations may also be classified as complete or incomplete. In an incomplete lesion, a layer of tissue surrounding the bronchus remains intact and can keep <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> airway, preventing it from leaking into the areas surrounding the airways. Incomplete lacerations may require closer scrutiny to detect and may not be diagnosed right away.|$|E
5|$|Mole crickets {{have three}} life stages, eggs, nymphs, and adults. Most {{of their life}} in these stages is spent underground, but adults have wings and {{disperse}} in the breeding season. They vary in their diet; some species are vegetarian, mainly feeding on roots, others are omnivores, including worms and grubs in their diet, while a few are largely predatory. Male mole crickets have an exceptionally loud song; they sing from a subsurface burrow that opens out into <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shape of an exponential horn. The song is an almost pure tone, modulated into chirps. It is used to attract females, either for mating, or for indicating favourable habitats for them to lay their eggs.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} known {{experiments}} {{on the relationship between}} combustion and air was conducted by the 2nd centuryBCE Greek writer on mechanics, Philo of Byzantium. In his work Pneumatica, Philo observed that inverting a vessel over a burning candle and surrounding the vessel's neck with water resulted in some water rising into the neck. Philo incorrectly surmised that parts of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vessel were converted into the classical element fire and thus were able to escape through pores in the glass. Many centuries later Leonardo da Vinci built on Philo's work by observing that a portion of air is consumed during combustion and respiration.|$|E

5|$|The Patries {{design as}} a {{semi-rigid}} airship {{required that the}} pressure of both the lifting gas in the gas-bag and <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ballonet be sufficient to maintain the airship's overall shape. Sufficient hydrogen was pumped into the gas-bag to enable the airship to ascend to its intended maximum operating altitude of , at which height the ballonet would occupy approximately one-fifth of the total gas-bag volume. Descent was made by releasing hydrogen from the gas-bag and then pumping air into the ballonet {{to take up the}} volume of the released gas, a process which was repeated incrementally until the desired rate of descent or altitude had been achieved.|$|E
5|$|The Phantom Tollbooth is a children's fantasy {{adventure}} novel written by Norton Juster with illustrations by Jules Feiffer, published in 1961 by Random House (USA). It {{tells the story}} of a bored young boy named Milo who unexpectedly receives a magic tollbooth one afternoon and, having nothing better to do, drives through it in his toy car, transporting him to the Kingdom of Wisdom, once prosperous but now troubled. There, he acquires two faithful companions and goes on a quest to restore to the kingdom its exiled princesses—named Rhyme and Reason—from the Castle in <b>the</b> <b>Air.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> process, he learns valuable lessons, finding a love of learning. The text is full of puns and wordplay, such as when Milo unintentionally jumps to Conclusions, an island in Wisdom, thus exploring the literal meanings of idioms.|$|E
5|$|The shorts were {{featured}} on the first three seasons on The Tracey Ullman Show.

5|$|Neighbours was {{immediately}} bought by Seven's rival Network Ten. The new network {{had to build}} replica sets when it took over production after Seven destroyed the original sets to prevent the rival network obtaining them. Ten began screening the series with episode 171 on 20 January 1986. In 1986, the series was bought by the BBC {{as part of their}} new daytime schedule in the United Kingdom. Neighbours made its debut on BBC1 on 27 October 1986 starting with the pilot episode. It soon gained a loyal audience and the show became particularly popular with younger viewers, and before long was watched by up to 16million viewers - more than the entire population of Australia at the time. In 1988 Neighbours became the only television show to have its entire cast flown over to the UK to make an appearance at the Royal Variety Performance in front of the Queen. Neighbours has since become the longest running drama series in Australian television and the seventh longest running serial drama still on <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world. In 2005, Neighbours celebrated its 20th anniversary and over twenty former cast members returned for a special episode, which saw them sitting down to watch a documentary about Ramsay Street. At the Logie Award ceremony that year, the show was inducted into the Logie Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Previously, the Sistine Chapel's only {{ventilation}} {{was from}} its {{windows in the}} upper level of the walls. To prevent exhaust fumes and wind-blown pollutants from entering, the windows are now permanently closed and an air conditioning system has been installed. The installation is by Carrier of the United Technologies Corporation and was developed {{with the cooperation of}} the Vatican's Office of Technical Services. It has been designed to counteract the various problems specific to the Chapel, in particular the rapid changes of heat and humidity that occur with the admission of the first crowds of tourists each morning and the departure of the last visitors each afternoon. The air conditioning varies not only the heat but also the relative humidity between the summer and winter months so that changes to the atmospheric environment occur gradually. The air near the ceiling is kept at a temperate level, while <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower section of the building is cooler and circulates more rapidly, with the effect that dirt particles fall towards the floor rather than being streamed upwards. Bacteria and chemical pollutants are filtered out.|$|E
