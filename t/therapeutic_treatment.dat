25|$|The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) {{concluded}} {{that while it}} is important to acknowledge the body of academic literature which raises controversies and criticisms surrounding ADHD for the purpose of developing clinical guidelines, {{it is not possible to}} offer alternative methods of assessment (i.e. ICD 10 and DSM IV) or <b>therapeutic</b> <b>treatment</b> recommendations. NICE stated that this is because the current <b>therapeutic</b> <b>treatment</b> interventions and methods of diagnosis for ADHD are based on the dominant view of the academic literature. NICE further {{concluded that}} despite such criticism, ADHD represented a valid clinical condition, with genetic, environmental, neurobiological, and demographic factors. The diagnosis has a high level of support from clinicians and medical authorities.|$|E
25|$|The first {{encyclopedia}} {{of medicine in}} Arabic language was by Persian scientist Ali ibn Sahl Rabban al-Tabari's Firdous al-Hikmah ("Paradise of Wisdom"), written in seven parts, c. 860. Al-Tabari, {{a pioneer in the}} field of child development, emphasized strong ties between psychology and medicine, and the need for psychotherapy and counseling in the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>treatment</b> of patients. His encyclopedia also discussed the influence of Sushruta and Chanakya on medicine, including psychotherapy.|$|E
25|$|A {{tool that}} is being used now to test {{efficacy}} and safety of a drug specific to a targeted patient group/sub-group is companion diagnostics. This technology is an assay that is developed during or after a drug is made available on the market and is helpful in enhancing the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>treatment</b> available based on the individual. These companion diagnostics have incorporated the pharmacogenomic information related to the drug into their prescription label in an effort to assist in making the most optimal treatment decision possible for the patient.|$|E

25|$|At {{the press}} conference held by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation on July 17, 2007, it was {{announced}} that three different drugs were found in Nancy Benoit's system: hydrocodone, hydromorphone and Xanax. All three drugs were found to be at levels investigators considered normal for <b>therapeutic</b> <b>treatment</b> (as opposed to recreational use or abuse.) A blood-alcohol level was found at 0.184. Dr. Kris Sperry, the medical examiner, added it was impossible to say whether any of the blood findings was due to ingestion of alcohol or the post-mortem process. It was also ruled out that Nancy was sedated by Chris before she was murdered.|$|E
25|$|Radiation {{oncology}} is {{the medical}} specialty concerned with prescribing radiation, and {{is distinct from}} radiology, the use of radiation in medical imaging and diagnosis. Radiation may be prescribed by a radiation oncologist with intent to cure ("curative") or for adjuvant therapy. It may {{also be used as}} palliative treatment (where cure is not possible and the aim is for local disease control or symptomatic relief) or as <b>therapeutic</b> <b>treatment</b> (where the therapy has survival benefit and it can be curative). It is also common to combine radiation therapy with surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy or some mixture of the four. Most common cancer types can be treated with radiation therapy in some way.|$|E
25|$|Recovering {{stereo vision}} {{as far as}} {{possible}} has long been established as an approach to the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>treatment</b> of stereoblind patients. Treatment aims to recover stereo vision in very young children, as well as in patients who had acquired but lost their ability for stereopsis due to a medical condition. In contrast, this aim has normally not been present in the treatment of those who missed out on learning stereopsis during their first few years of life. In fact, the acquisition of binocular and stereo vision was long thought to be impossible unless the person acquired this skill during a critical period in infancy and early childhood. This hypothesis normally went unquestioned and has formed the basis for the therapeutic approaches to binocular disorders for decades. It has been put in doubt in recent years. In particular since studies on stereopsis recovery began to appear in scientific journals and it became publicly known that neuroscientist Susan R. Barry achieved stereopsis well into adulthood, that assumption is in retrospect considered to have held the status of a scientific dogma.|$|E

2500|$|Although most {{commonly}} due to cirrhosis, severe liver disease or metastatic cancer, its presence {{can be a}} sign of other significant medical problems, such as Budd–Chiari syndrome. Diagnosis of the cause is usually with blood tests, an ultrasound scan of the abdomen, and direct removal of the fluid by needle, or paracentesis (which may also be <b>therapeutic).</b> <b>Treatment</b> may be with medication (diuretics), paracentesis, or other treatments directed at the cause.

Further research and understanding of the correlation between gliotransmission and neurological disorders could lead to new targets for <b>therapeutic</b> <b>treatment</b> in the brain.
