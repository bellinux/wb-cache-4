The Saudi border {{with the state}} of Oman, on the southeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula, runs <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Empty</b> Quarter (Rub 'al-Khali). The border demarcation was defined by a 1990 agreement between Saudi Arabia and Oman that included provisions for shared grazing rights and water rights. The border through 'Al Buraymi Oasis, located near the conjunction of the frontiers of Oman, Abu Dhabi (one of the emirates of the UAE) and Saudi Arabia, has triggered extensive dispute among the three states since the Treaty of Jeddah in 1927.

In return, Saudi Arabia obtained an outlet to the Persian Gulf through Abu Dhabi.|$|E
