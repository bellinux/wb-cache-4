However, providers may well tweak ratings to their own advantage. That {{is why we have}} designed a new decentralized mechanism (dubbed MobiRate) with which {{portable devices}} store ratings in (local) <b>tamperevident</b> tables and check the integrity of those tables through a gossiping protocol. We evaluate the extent to which MobiRate reduces the impact of tampered ratings and consequently locates reputable service providers. We do so using real mobility and social network data. We also assess computational and communication costs of MobiRate on mobile phones...|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} key {{generation}} based on Physically Obfuscated Keys (POKs), i. e., {{a certain type}} of <b>tamperevident</b> Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) that can be used as protection against invasive physical attacks. To design a protected device, one must take attacks such as probing of data lines or penetration of the physical security boundary into consideration. For the implementation of a POK as a countermeasure, physical properties of a material - which covers all parts to be protected - are measured. After measuring these properties, i. e. analog values, they have to be quantized in order to derive a cryptographic key. This paper will present and discuss the impact of the quantization method with regard to three parameters: key quality, tamper-sensitivity, and reliability. Our contribution is the analysis of two different quantization schemes considering these parameters. Foremost, we propose a new approach to achieve improved tampersensitivity in the worst-case with no information leakage...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates {{and reviews}} {{literature}} regarding {{a range of}} topics important to the research question – the themes apply across all the topics. The topics include label and package warnings, including <b>tamperevident</b> features, to review their effect on the consumer behaviour of changing usage or purchase decisions. This information was then applied to gain insight into anticounterfeit product/package efforts. Based on this research, it appears that there is value for brand marketers to enhance their anticounterfeit efforts and consumer confidence by utilizing warning labels and information labels on their labels or packages. Currently, consumer perception of a domestic counterfeit product threat (promoted as genuine products), even for pharmaceuticals by healthcare professionals, although increasing has still been very low. Generally, the consumers believe and expect that the product purchased from retailers is safe and genuine. The study reviewed many key warning and label communication areas: consumer behaviour review, technical specifications, anticounterfeit, tamper evidence/tamper resistance, over‐the‐counter drugs, alcohol, cigarette, nutrition food and nutrition supplements. To complete the insight on communicating with the consumer, a review of label legibility was included. Before brand marketers consider adding anticounterfeit warning labels, extensive consumer behaviour research should be conducted {{in areas such as}} fear appeals and involuntary risk outrage...|$|E
40|$|The {{storage of}} votes is a {{critical}} component of any voting system. In traditional systems there is a high level of transparency in the mechanisms used to store votes, and thus a reasonable degree of trustworthiness in the security of the votes in storage. This degree of transparency is much more difficult to attain in electronic voting systems, and so the specific mechanisms put in place to ensure the security of stored votes require much stronger verification {{in order for them to}} be trusted by the public. There are many desirable properties that one could reasonably expect a vote store to exhibit. From the point of view of security, we argue that tamper-evident storage is one of the most important requirements: the changing, or deletion of already validated and stored votes should be detectable; as should the addition of unauthorised votes after the election is concluded. We propose the application of formal methods (in this paper, event-B) for guaranteeing, through construction, the correctness of a vote store with respect to the requirement for <b>tamperevident</b> storage. We illustrate the utility of our refinementbased approach by verifying — through the application of a reusable formal design pattern — a store design that uses a specific PROM technology and applies a specific encoding mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Many {{real-world}} applications wish to collect <b>tamperevident</b> logs for forensic purposes. This paper considers {{the case of}} an untrusted logger, serving a number of clients who wish to store their events in the log, and kept honest by a number of auditors who will challenge the logger to prove its correct behavior. We propose semantics of tamper-evident logs in terms of this auditing process. The logger must be able to prove that individual logged events are still present, and that the log, as seen now, is consistent with how it was seen in the past. To accomplish this efficiently, we describe a tree-based data structure that can generate such proofs with logarithmic size and space, improving over previous linear constructions. Where a classic hash chain might require an 800 MB trace to prove that a randomly chosen event is in a log with 80 million events, our prototype returns a 3 KB proof with the same semantics. We also present a flexible mechanism for the log server to present authenticated and tamper-evident search results for all events matching a predicate. This can allow large-scale log servers to selectively delete old events, in an agreed-upon fashion, while generating efficient proofs that no inappropriate events were deleted. We describe a prototype implementation and measure its performance on an 80 million event syslog trace at 1, 750 events per second using a single CPU core. Performance improves to 10, 500 events per second if cryptographic signatures are offloaded, corresponding to 1. 1 TB of logging throughput per week. ...|$|E
