25|$|The {{independent}} Albania {{established on}} 28 November 1912 {{is the first}} Albanian state in modern history. It was a parliamentary state, not a monarchy. Some sources {{refer to it as}} <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Albania</b> or the Albanian Republic.|$|E
25|$|Since Albania was {{declared}} independent on November 28, 1912, every 28 November is commemorated by all Albanians (wherever {{they live in}} the world) as their National Day (Albanian Independence Day or Flag Day). In <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Albania,</b> the day is celebrated as a public holiday. The Republic of Kosovo the day became an officially public holiday, since a 2011 decision of the Prime Minister Hashim Thaçi's cabinet.|$|E
25|$|Between 1912 and 1914, it {{was under}} the control of the Albanian {{provisional}} government, and controlled by the Principality of Albania between 1914 and 1915. It was occupied by the Allies in 1915 during the First World War, despite Albania's neutrality, before falling to Austro-Hungarian forces in 1916. Austria-Hungary sustained the occupation until 1918, after which it was occupied by Italy. Italy had plans to create an autonomous province over Albania, including the area of Berat. However, following the defeat of Italy in the Vlora War, Albania retook control of Berat. Italy again occupied Berat in 1939 during the Italian invasion of Albania. Following Italy's capitulation, Germany occupied Albania between 1943 and 1944. In November 1944, the communist-controlled Anti-Fascist National Liberation Council of Albania declared in Berat that it was the provisional government of the country, signalling the beginning of the Enver Hoxha dictatorship. Communist Albania retained control over Albania for many decades, until finally falling in 1992. Berat has since then been part of <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Albania.</b>|$|E
