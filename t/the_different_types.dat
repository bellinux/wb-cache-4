Using {{the social network}} analysis methodology, this study embarks on the objective in elucidating the structure of network depending on <b>the</b> <b>different</b> <b>type</b> of inter-organizational relations. <b>The</b> <b>different</b> pattern of embeddedness in <b>the</b> <b>different</b> <b>type</b> of inter-organizational relationship {{raise the question of}} how should we treat <b>the</b> <b>different</b> <b>type</b> of inter-organizational relationships and the pattern of embeddedness.

5|$|A CO-oximeter {{can be used}} to {{determine}} carboxyhemoglobin levels. Pulse CO-oximeters estimate carboxyhemoglobin with a non-invasive finger clip similar to a pulse oximeter.

The use of a regular pulse oximeter is not effective in the diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning as people with carbon monoxide poisoning may have a normal oxygen saturation level on a pulse oximeter. This is due to the carboxyhemoglobin being misrepresented as oxyhemoglobin.|$|E
5|$|It is {{relatively}} {{difficult to separate}} ytterbium from other lanthanides due to its similar properties. As a result, the process is somewhat long. First, minerals such as monazite or xenotime are dissolved into various acids, such as sulfuric acid. Ytterbium can then be separated from other lanthanides by ion exchange, as can other lanthanides. The solution is then applied to a resin, which different lanthanides bind in different matters. This is then dissolved using complexing agents, and due to <b>the</b> <b>different</b> <b>types</b> of bonding exhibited by the different lanthanides, {{it is possible to}} isolate the compounds.|$|E

Effectively, the multiverse evolves as a universal wavefunction. If the Big Bang that created our multiverse created an ensemble of multiverses, the wave function of the ensemble would be entangled in this sense.|$|E

Limestone has fissures and is soluble in water, therefore rivers {{have been able to}} carve deep, narrow valleys. The rivers then often find routes underground, creating cave systems. Millstone Grit is insoluble but porous, absorbing water which seeps through the grits, until it meets the less porous shales beneath, creating springs where it reaches the surface. The shales are friable and easily attacked by frost and form areas that are vulnerable to landslides, as on Mam Tor.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the epic}} poem Mahabharata, Krishna becomes Arjuna's charioteer for the Kurukshetra War, {{but on the}} {{condition}} that he personally will not raise any weapon. Upon arrival at the battlefield, and seeing that the enemies are his family, his grandfather, and his cousins and loved ones, Arjuna is moved and says his heart will not allow him to fight and kill others. He would rather renounce the kingdom and put down his Gandiv (Arjuna's bow). Krishna then advises him about the nature of life, ethics, and morality when one is faced with a war between good and evil, the impermanence of matter, the permanence of the soul and the good, duties and responsibilities, the nature of true peace and bliss and <b>the</b> <b>different</b> <b>types</b> of yoga to reach this state of bliss and inner liberation.

5|$|In 2005, Rasmussen {{was part}} of a large multi-institutional {{collaboration}} investigating biodiversity hotspots, which have a prominent role in conservation. The study assessed locations quantitatively for three criteria of bird diversity – species richness, the level of threat, and the number of endemism species. The results demonstrated that hotspots did not show the same geographical distribution for each factor. Only 2.5% of hotspot areas are common to all three aspects of diversity, with over 80% of hotspots registering on only one criterion. Each criterion explained less than 24% of the variation in the other factors, suggesting that even within a single taxonomic class, different mechanisms are responsible for the origin and maintenance of various aspects of diversity. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>different</b> <b>types</b> of hotspots also vary greatly in their utility as conservation tools.|$|E
5|$|Items {{from the}} hoard {{have been on}} display almost {{continuously}} since the treasure was received at the British Museum. Some items were displayed at the Museum as early as September 1993 in response to public interest. Much of the hoard was exhibited at Ipswich Museum in 1994–1995. From 1997, the most important items went on permanent display at the British Museum {{in a new and}} enlarged Roman Britain gallery (Room 49), alongside the roughly contemporary Thetford Hoard, and adjacent to the Mildenhall Treasure, which contains large silver vessels of types that are absent from the Hoxne Hoard. Some items from the Hoxne Hoard were included in Treasure: Finding Our Past, a touring exhibition that was shown in five cities in England and Wales in 2003. A perspex reconstruction of the chest and inner boxes in which it was deposited was created for this tour, showing the arrangement of <b>the</b> <b>different</b> <b>types</b> of items with sample items inside.

5|$|The {{objective}} in Days of Ruin {{is for the}} player to use their military force to defeat the enemy's force. Except for certain single player missions with special objectives, {{there are two ways}} to defeat an opponent: destroy all of the enemy's units or capture their headquarters. The battle system is turn-based. Two to four forces, each headed by a commanding officer (CO), take turns building and commanding units on grid-based maps. Every turn, units, which consist of ground, sea and air units, can move across <b>the</b> <b>different</b> <b>types</b> of terrain and attack enemy units or perform other actions, such as submerging a submarine or resupplying friendly units. Many factors can affect the battle, such as Fog of War, a phenomenon that prevents players from seeing enemy units other than those in the visual range of their units; various weather conditions; and CO powers.|$|E
5|$|The {{power of}} stories to {{entertain}} {{is evident in}} one of the most famous ones—Scheherazade—a story in the Persian professional storytelling tradition, of a woman who saves her own life by telling stories. The connections between <b>the</b> <b>different</b> <b>types</b> of entertainment are shown by the way that stories like this inspire a retelling in another medium, such as music, film or games. For example, composers Rimsky-Korsakov, Ravel and Szymanowski have each been inspired by the Scheherazade story and turned it into an orchestral work; director Pasolini made a film adaptation; and there is an innovative video game based on the tale. Stories may be told wordlessly, in music, dance or puppetry for example, such as in the Javanese tradition of wayang, in which the performance is accompanied by a gamelan orchestra or the similarly traditional Punch and Judy show.|$|E

Cranky Kong, who owns shops throughout the island, is the only Kong family member that appears other than Donkey and Diddy. The story begins when a group of evil Tikis known as the Tiki Tak Tribe arrive on Donkey Kong Island after being awoken by a volcanic eruption, and play music to hypnotize the animals on the island into stealing Donkey Kong's bananas. Since Donkey Kong is resistant to the Tikis' music, he works with Diddy Kong to retrieve his hoard of bananas from the Tikis. Throughout the game, the pair travel through eight worlds to recover their stolen bananas: the Jungle, the Beach, the Ruins, the Cave, the Forest, the Cliff, the Factory, and the Volcano. In each world, they must defeat a Tiki Tak Tribe leader: Kalimba, the Maraca Triplets, Gong, Banjo, Panflute, Xylophone, Accordion (who hypnotizes other animals in the jungle to fight the Kongs), and Tiki Tong, the king of the Tiki Tak Tribe. After Tiki Tong is defeated, the Kongs are launched into space where they punch down on the Moon, crushing Tiki Tong's base and sending bananas flying everywhere.|$|E
