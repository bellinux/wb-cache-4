500|$|Progressive jazz {{is a form}} of {{big band}} that is more complex or experimental. It {{originated}} in the 1940s with arrangers who drew from modernist composers such as Igor Stravinsky and Paul Hindemith. Its [...] "progressive" [...] features were replete with dissonance, atonality, and brash effects. Progressive jazz was most popularized by the bandleader Stan Kenton during the 1940s. Critics were initially wary of the idiom. Dizzy Gillespie wrote in his autobiography; [...] "They tried to make Stan Kenton a 'white hope,' called modern jazz and my music 'progressive,' then tried to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> played 'progressive' music. I said, 'You're full of shit!' 'Stan Kenton? There ain't nothing in my music that's cold, cold like his." ...|$|E

I trust I feel thankful to God for having enabled me to make what seems a right choice; and I pray to be enabled to repay as I ought the affectionate devotion of a truthful, honourable man." ...|$|E

Drawn in by live music, he stopped for a drink and ended up spending most of the $400 he had saved. He explained: [...] "I went in this jazz joint and had a drink. I liked it and I stayed. People <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> get foolish, good-natured sometimes. Anyway, I guess I felt real benevolent that day. I must have been handing out bills to anyone that asked me. I {{came out of that}} place with sixteen dollars left." [...] According to the authors Steven Roby and Brad Schreiber: [...] "Alcohol would later be the scourge of his existence, driving him to fits of pique, even rare bursts of atypical, physical violence." ...|$|E

2500|$|Commenting on the colt's success, Dettori said [...] "I {{had an easy}} lead, but Jamie [...] {{was very}} clever. He {{attacked}} early, he eyeballed me, but the horse showed what a true champion he is. He {{has a lot of}} guts and was going away at the end." [...] After the race Oppenheimer was reportedly keen to run the colt in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes but Gosden was cautious in outlining future plans saying [...] "a day at a time, a week at the time, the horse’ll <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> watch, I listen, that’s my job. It’s up to the horse". He did however, suggest that the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe could be a long-term target but added that the colt would not run if the ground was [...] "bottomless".|$|E

In addition to performing {{on the show}} as himself and as [...] "visions", each episode of the show's first season was named after a song of his. Michael appeared on the 2008 finale show of American Idol on 21 May singing [...] "Praying for Time". When asked what he thought Simon Cowell would say of his performance, he replied [...] "I think he'll probably <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> shouldn't have done a George Michael song.

2500|$|Martinez wrote a 1992 guest {{column in}} the Oakland Tribune: [...] "When I walk around nude, I am acting how I think it is {{reasonable}} to act, not how middle-class values <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> should act. I am refusing to hide my dissent in normalcy even though it is very easy to do so." [...] Martinez, who typically attended classes wearing only sandals and a backpack, became a cause célèbre at the university for a while, participating in a number of nude events on campus and performances by the Bay Area nude performance group the X-Plicit Players. He appeared on national talk shows, was profiled in a photo essay in Playgirl and was parodied in the 1994 college comedy PCU.

2500|$|Melba's first {{recordings}} {{were made}} around 1895, recorded on cylinders at the Bettini Phonograph Lab in New York. A reporter from Phonoscope magazine was impressed: [...] "The next cylinder was labelled 'Melba' and was truly wonderful, the phonograph reproducing her wonderful voice in a marvellous manner, especially the high notes which soared away above {{the staff and}} were rich and clear." [...] Melba was less impressed: [...] "'Never again,' I said to myself as I listened to the scratching, screeching result. 'Don't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> sing like that, or I shall go away and live on a desert island.'" [...] The recordings never reached the general public– destroyed on Melba's orders, it is suspected– and Melba would not venture into a recording studio for another eight years. Melba can be heard singing on several Mapleson Cylinders, early attempts at live recording, made by the Metropolitan Opera House librarian Lionel Mapleson in the auditorium there during performances. These cylinders are often poor in quality, but they preserve something {{of the quality of}} the young Melba's voice and performance that is sometimes lacking from her commercial recordings.|$|E
