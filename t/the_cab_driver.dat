5|$|The {{video is}} set at night and opens with Brown, {{dressed in a black}} suit, {{drinking}} alcohol in the streets, before hailing a futuristic hover-cab. Brown asks <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> <b>driver</b> {{to take him to the}} best spot in town. He then asks the driver to turn up the air conditioner because he's hot, but the driver turns up the music instead, while wearing a horse mask on his head. As the song begins, Brown exits the cab and arrives at a street party filled with people wearing animal heads. He then enters a club, where he performs the first dance sequence in the video with his male backup dancers. During the first chorus, Brown arrives inside the main room of the club filled with flashing lights and people dancing while wearing animal heads. After a hat gets tossed to him by one of his dancers in the crowd, Brown and his backup dancers perform another dance sequence as the queen of the party watches them from her perch. These party scenes are intercut with scenes of Brown dancing alone in another room surrounded by flashing lights and speakers in the background.|$|E

After getting off the train at Ambala Cantt, he took a cab to Patiala on the night of 31 January 1992.

500|$|After {{calling a}} number of minor {{witnesses}} (including <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> <b>driver</b> {{and the owner of}} the building Williams and Seymour lived in), the prosecution called Edgar Power. Power testified that Williams had bragged about shooting Walls in response to Powers' chaffing him about being a poor shot. According to Power, Williams responded to the chaff by saying, [...] "Well, that was a good shot anyhow," [...] referring to the shot that had killed Walls. Williams' barrister Hastings later described Power as [...] " [...] utterly contemptible human being I have ever met," [...] and during his cross-examination Hastings highlighted Power's betrayal of his close friends, Williams and Seymour.|$|E
500|$|Pinter {{began to}} direct more {{frequently}} during the 1970s, becoming an {{associate director of}} the National Theatre (NT) in 1973. [...] He directed almost 50 productions of his own and others' plays for stage, film, and television, including 10 productions of works by Simon Gray: the stage and/or film premières of Butley (stage, 1971; film, 1974), Otherwise Engaged (1975), The Rear Column (stage, 1978; TV, 1980), Close of Play (NT, 1979), Quartermaine's Terms (1981), Life Support (1997), The Late Middle Classes (1999), and The Old Masters (2004). [...] Several of those productions starred Alan Bates (1934–2003), who originated the stage and screen roles of not only Butley but also Mick in Pinter's first major commercial success, The Caretaker (stage, 1960; film, 1964); and in Pinter's double-bill produced at the Lyric Hammersmith in 1984, he played Nicolas in One for the Road and <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> <b>driver</b> in Victoria Station.

2500|$|In March 1937, {{there was}} a violent strike by about 3,500 drivers for Checker and Yellow Cab Companies which {{included}} rioting that went on for weeks. <b>The</b> <b>cab</b> companies hired strike breakers, and <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> <b>drivers</b> union hired [...] "sluggers" [...] who raged through the downtown Chicago area looking for <b>cabs</b> and <b>drivers</b> not participating in the strike.|$|R
500|$|However, Auerbach {{could not}} prevent the Celtics from {{going into a}} slump {{at the end of}} the 1970s. He traded away both Silas and Westphal because they wanted salary {{increases}} that would have made them higher earners than the best player on the Celtics (Cowens), which was not acceptable to Auerbach. [...] While the Westphal trade to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Charlie Scott was considered a success due to the Celtics' 13th title in 1976, Auerbach later admitted he erred in letting Silas go, even after Cowens personally begged him to give Silas a new deal. When Havlicek retired in 1978, the Celtics went 61–103 in two seasons. In the summer of 1978, after the worst in a string of contentious clashes with several different owners after Walter Brown's passing in 1964, Auerbach hopped into a taxi to take him to Logan Airport, where he was to board a flight to New York to consider a lucrative contract offer from Knicks owner Sonny Werblin. However, <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> <b>driver</b> pleaded with him to stay, emphasizing how much Bostonians loved him and considered him family. Soon after, heading a team press conference, and with his typical bravado, Auerbach puffed on his trademark cigar and stated simply, [...] "I'm not going anywhere. [...] We're going to sign Larry Bird, and we're going to be on top again." [...] Despite knowing that Bird, a talented young player from unheralded Indiana State, had a year of college eligibility remaining, he had drafted Bird as a junior eligible in the 1978 NBA draft and waited for a year until the future Hall-of-Fame forward Bird arrived, finally setting aside his team salary rules when it became clear that his choices were paying Bird a record-setting rookie salary or watch him simply re-enter the 1979 draft. Bird then became the highest-paid Celtic as a rookie, with a $650,000-per year deal. Auerbach knew that the brilliant, hardworking Bird would be the cornerstone of a new Celtics generation.|$|E
2500|$|On November 10, 1980, Rather {{landed at}} Chicago's O'Hare International Airport {{and got into}} a cab. He asked <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> <b>driver</b> {{to take him to}} the home of Studs Terkel whom he was {{interviewing}} for 60Minutes. [...] A police spokesman stated that <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> <b>driver</b> refused to go to the address and instead [...] "wildly drove through the city streets" [...] with Rather shouting out the window asking for help. The cabbie was charged with disorderly conduct. Rather called the incident [...] "a rather minor thing".|$|E
2500|$|During production, {{management}} booked {{dates for}} the band's upcoming European tour. This proved {{a problem for}} Thomas as he felt the album needed more songs. Thomas recalls, [...] "They had an incredible momentum building and were gaining fans all the time. There was an audience waiting for the product, but I decided that they didn't have the right songs yet". Thomas persuaded primary songwriters Hutchence and Andrew to fly to Hong Kong (where Hutchence and drummer Jon Farriss owned an apartment) to write more material for Kick. While waiting for a cab {{to go to the}} airport to fly to Hong Kong, Andrew thought up the famous guitar riff for [...] "Need You Tonight". He told <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> <b>driver</b> to wait a couple of minutes while {{he went back to his}} motel room to grab something. In fact, he went back record the riff on cassette. <b>The</b> <b>cab</b> <b>driver</b> was furious when Andrew returned to the cab forty-five minutes later. When Hutchence heard the demo in Hong Kong, he began to write the song's lyrics, penning them in just ten minutes.|$|E

It was directed by Stroman and starred most of the original Broadway cast, except for Brad Oscar, who was unable to reprise the role of Franz because he had signed on to play Max on Broadway and, instead, had a brief cameo as <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> <b>driver,</b> and Cady Huffman. Their roles were played by Will Ferrell and Uma Thurman, respectively. The songs [...] "King of Broadway", [...] "In Old Bavaria", and [...] "Where Did We Go Right?"

2500|$|... 1969: First cab {{regulation}} for mandatory partition requirement. Cost: approx. $100.00. This requirement, initially, {{was implemented}} specifically to stop an assailant's bullet from hurting <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> <b>driver.</b> Cab regulators instituted the partition requirement over the strenuous objections of cab drivers and cab owners. Their objections {{were regarded as}} {{less important than the}} speculations of an alleged majority of cab drivers. A slim majority of the cab drivers that were polled stated that they were in favor of a mandatory partition requirement according to the cab regulators. The drivers responded to the mail-in poll conducted by the BPDHD. The material used was 1/4" [...] Plexiglas and was not at all bullet resistant. [...] It was not bulletproof either. Nothing is bulletproof yet that is the term used consistently by cab regulators and the media when describing the protective nature of the partitions.|$|E
2500|$|Gideon chose W. Fred Turner to be {{his lawyer}} in his second trial. The retrial took place on August 5, 1963, {{five months after the}} Supreme Court ruling. [...] Turner, during the trial, picked apart the {{testimony}} of eyewitness Henry Cook, and in his opening and closing statements suggested that Cook likely had been a lookout for a group of young men who broke into the poolroom to steal beer, then grabbed the coins while they were there. Turner also obtained a statement from <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> <b>driver</b> who had taken Gideon from Bay Harbor, Florida to a bar in Panama City, Florida, stating that Gideon was carrying neither wine, beer nor Coke when he picked him up, even though Cook testified that he had watched Gideon walk from the pool hall to the phone, and then wait for a cab. This testimony completely discredited Cook.|$|E

2500|$|Soon {{after the}} release of Lucifer Rising, a PBS {{documentary}} of Anger and his films was made, titled Kenneth Anger's Magick, which was directed by Kit Fitzgerald, who later recalled interviewing him in his New York flat on a very hot July evening, during which Anger revealed that he was so broke that he had been forced to sell his air conditioner. Anger himself considered producing other films that would continue on from Lucifer Rising in a series, and he began referring to his finished film as [...] "Part I: Sign Language", to be followed by two further parts. Nonetheless, these projects would never be finished, and Anger himself would not produce any further films for nearly two decades. In need of money, Anger subsequently released Hollywood Babylon II in 1984, as well as continuing to screen his films at various festivals and at universities; around this time he began wearing an eyepatch to these public events, something likely due to him having been beaten up and getting a bruised eye, a story that he would bring up in various interviews, although partly changing who it was who had beaten him up in various versions of the story. In 1984, a notorious incident occurred when Anger was invited to appear on The Coca Crystal Show, however upon arriving at the studio he demanded that somebody pay for his taxi ride there, and when they refused, he attacked the talent coordinator Maureen Ivice and tried to drag her into his taxi, before she was rescued by other members of staff – Anger reportedly escaped the scene by flinging a $100 bill at <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> <b>driver</b> and screaming [...] "GET ME OUT OF HERE!" ...|$|E

60|$|Beyond {{the moment}} that <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> <b>driver</b> had {{deposited}} his fare beside the curb {{in front of the}} house in which the Russian had been quartered there was no clue.

The proprietor of the house identified the picture of the lad as that of one who had been a frequent visitor in the room of the old man. Aside from this he knew nothing. And there, at the door of a grimy, old building in the slums of London, the searchers came to a blank wall--baffled.|$|E
60|$|As {{was true}} of the general public, his chief {{interest}} in the matter centered about the mysterious disappearance of the slayer. Or at least this was true until he learned, several days subsequent to the tragedy, that his son Jack had not reported at the public school en route for which they had seen him safely ensconced in a railway carriage. Even then the father did not connect the disappearance of his son with the mystery surrounding the whereabouts of the ape. Nor was it until a month later that careful investigation revealed {{the fact that the}} boy had left the train before it pulled out of the station at London, and <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> <b>driver</b> had been found who had driven him to the address of the old Russian, that Tarzan of the Apes realized that Akut had in some way been connected with the disappearance of the boy.|$|E
