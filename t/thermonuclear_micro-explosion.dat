50|$|Around {{the same}} time (in 1956) a meeting was {{organized}} at the Max Planck Institute in Germany by the fusion pioneer Carl Friedrich von Weizs√§cker. At this meeting Friedwardt Winterberg proposed the non-fission ignition of a <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>micro-explosion</b> by a convergent shock wave driven with high explosives. Further reference to Winterberg's work in Germany on nuclear micro explosions (mininukes) is contained in a declassified report of the former East German Stasi (Staatsicherheitsdienst).|$|E
40|$|A {{deuterium-tritium}} (DT) nuclear pulse propulsion {{concept for}} fast interplanetary transport is proposed utilizing {{almost all the}} energy for thrust and {{without the need for}} a large radiator: 1. By letting the <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>micro-explosion</b> take place {{in the center of a}} liquid hydrogen sphere with the radius of the sphere large enough to slow down and absorb the neutrons of the DT fusion reaction, heating the hydrogen to a fully ionized plasma at a temperature of ~ 105 K. 2. By using the entire spacecraft as a magnetically insulated gigavolt capacitor, igniting the DT micro-explosion with an intense GeV ion beam discharging the gigavolt capacitor, possible if the space craft has the topology of a torus...|$|E
2500|$|Back in 1963, it was {{proposed}} by Winterberg that the ignition of <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>micro-explosions,</b> {{could be achieved}} by an intense beam of microparticles accelerated to a velocity of 1000km/s. And in 1968, [...] Winterberg proposed to use intense electron and ion beams, generated by Marx generators, for the same purpose. Most recently, Winterberg has proposed the ignition of a deuterium microexplosion, with a gigavolt super-Marx generator, which is a Marx Generator driven by up to 100 ordinary Marx generators.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{progress}} {{towards the}} non-fission ignition of <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>micro-explosions</b> raises the prospect for {{a revival of}} the nuclear bomb propulsion idea, both for the fast transport of large payloads within the solar system and the launch into earth orbit without the release of fission products into the atmosphere. To reach this goal three areas of research are of importance: 1) Compact thermonuclear ignition drivers. 2) Fast ignition and deuterium burn. 3) Space-craft architecture involving magnetic insulation and GeV electrostatic potential...|$|R

40|$|The {{recently}} proposed Super Marx generator pure deuterium micro-detonation ignition {{concept is}} compared to the Lawrence Livermore National Ignition Facility (NIF) Laser DT fusion-fission hybrid concept (LiFE) [1]. In a Super Marx generator {{a large number of}} ordinary Marx generators charge up a much larger second stage ultra-high voltage Marx generator, from which for the ignition of a pure deuterium micro-explosion an intense GeV ion beam can be extracted. A typical example of the LiFE concept is a fusion gain of 30, and a fission gain of 10, making up for a total gain of 300, with about 10 times more energy released into fission as compared to fusion. This means a substantial release of fission products, as in fusion-less pure fission reactors. In the Super Marx approach for the ignition of a pure deuterium micro-detonation a gain of the same magnitude can in theory be reached [2]. If feasible, the Super Marx generator deuterium ignition approach would make lasers obsolete as a means for the ignition of <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>micro-explosions.</b> Comment: 19 pages, 12 figure...|$|R
40|$|To {{reduce the}} {{radiation}} hazard for manned missions to Mars and beyond, a high specific impulse-high thrust system is needed, {{with a nuclear}} bomb propulsion system the preferred candidate. The propulsion with small fission bombs is excluded because the critical mass requirement leads to extravagant small fission burn up rates. This leaves open the propulsion with non-fission ignited <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>micro-explosions,</b> with a compact fusion micro-explosion igniter (driver), and no large radiator. It should {{not depend on the}} rare He 3 isotope, and only require a small amount of tritium. This excludes lasers for ignition. With multi-mega-amperegigavolt proton beams and a small amount of tritium, cylindrical deuterium targets can be ignited. The proton beams are generated by discharging the entire spacecraft as a magnetically insulated gigavolt capacitor. To avoid a large radiator, needed to remove the heat from the absorption of the fast neutrons in the spacecraft, the micro-explosion is surrounded by a thick layer of liquid hydrogen, stopping the neutrons and heating the hydrogen to a temperature of ~ 10 5 K, which as a fully ionized plasma can be repelled from the spacecraft by a magnetic mirror. 1...|$|R
