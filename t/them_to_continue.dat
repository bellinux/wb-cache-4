5|$|Just as predators such as {{angler fish}} have a {{structure}} that lures prey, so some parasites mimic their host's natural prey, but with roles reversed; the parasite gets eaten by the host. This deception provides the parasite easy entry into the host, which they can then feed upon, allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> their life cycle. Researchers {{may be able to}} predict the host of such parasites based on their appearance and behavior.|$|E

He pressured <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> touring, but they steadfastly refused.|$|E
5|$|The {{success and}} economy of {{multiple}} rocket launchers (MRL) have led <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> to be developed. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union fielded several models of Katyusha-like MRL, notably the BM-21 launchers somewhat {{inspired by the}} earlier weapon, and the larger BM-27. Advances in artillery munitions have been applied to some Katyusha-type multiple launch rocket systems, including bomblet submunitions, remotely deployed land mines, and chemical warheads.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months after}} its release in August 2001, Funcom began {{offering}} free trial subscriptions, now common practice for other {{games in the}} MMOG genre.

60|$|In the meantime, the brigades of Macpherson and Tytler had {{encountered}} enormous difficulties {{on the line}} of march. The roads they had taken were mere tracks, {{and there were many}} places where it was almost impossible to get the mountain guns along. From daybreak until late at night the troops labored, unceasingly. They knew, by the dull roar echoed and re-echoed among the mountains, that their comrades below were engaged; and the thought that a failure might ensue, owing to their absence from the contest, nerved <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>continued</b> exertions.|$|R

5|$|As the {{deadline}} passed on April 2, Melkonian's armor entered the intersection and encountered {{a line of}} Azeri tanks and infantry. A firefight ensued but lasted for only several minutes as the defense line was soon battered and destroyed. Many of the Azeri forces were ill-prepared for the attack as Melkonian noted when pointing out to their lack of equipment. Despite having his force reduced down {{to a total of}} sixty-eight men, a force too weak to take the capital, he ordered <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> forward.|$|E

5|$|At daybreak on {{the third}} day, the Phocians {{guarding}} the path above Thermopylae {{became aware of the}} outflanking Persian column by the rustling of oak leaves. Herodotus says they jumped up and were greatly amazed. Hydarnes was perhaps just as amazed to see them hastily arming themselves as they were to see him and his forces. He feared they were Spartans but was informed by Ephialtes that they were not. The Phocians retreated to a nearby hill to make their stand (assuming the Persians had come to attack them). However, not wishing to be delayed, the Persians merely shot a volley of arrows at them, before bypassing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> with their encirclement of the main Greek force.|$|E

5|$|Generally, {{companies}} want to retain creative {{control over their}} intellectual properties and are wary of fan-created works, like fan fiction. However, because machinima provides free marketing, they have avoided a response demanding strict copyright enforcement. In 2003, Linden Lab was praised for changing license terms to allow users to retain ownership of works created in its virtual world Second Life. Rooster Teeth initially tried to release Red vs. Blue unnoticed by Halos owners because they feared that any communication would force them to end the project. However, Microsoft, Bungie's parent company at the time, contacted the group shortly after episode 2, and allowed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> without paying licensing fees.|$|E

Donnie Steele substituted for Gray in the concerts; he was positioned behind Jordison and obscured from the audience's view.|$|E
5|$|Since its {{founding}} Nea Salamina sought to develop friendly {{relations with the}} Turkish Cypriots in Famagusta, and Turkish Cypriots (including Siekkeris, Nita and Moustafa) played during the early 1950s. When the team joined the CFA, it played against Turkish teams (including Demir Sports, Gençlik Gücü and the Mağusa Türk Gücü) in the second division. When Turkish Cypriot clubs began withdrawing from CFA tournaments of CFA in late 1955, the club tried to convince <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> and Turkish players remained welcome in Nea Salamina. In 1962 Kallikas {{was transferred to the}} club, and in 1970 Neziak (of Turkish origin) was also transferred.

5|$|The third British {{airborne}} mission planned was Operation Fustian, to {{be carried}} out by the 1st Parachute Brigade, under Brigadier Gerald Lathbury, and scheduled for the night of 13–14 July. The 1st Parachute Brigade's objective was the Primosole bridge, crossing the Simeto River, south of Catania. The bridge was a vital objective, as it was the only crossing point over the Simeto. Its capture would give the Eighth Army access to the Catania plain, to enable <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> their advance northwards; its destruction would seriously hamper the advance.
