5000|$|After the Church Committee {{had begun}} its investigation, the Nedzi Committee was created, headed by Democratic Congressman Lucien N. Nedzi which {{dissolved}} {{only after a}} few months.

The American Prospect gives some background, noting that prior to these investigations, [...] "the U.S. intelligence community had never undergone significant congressional scrutiny" [...] because of a [...] "laissez-faire attitude...but after a 1974 New York Times series by Seymour Hersh revealed that the CIA had conducted [...] "massive" [...] illegal spying activities against American antiwar protesters and dissidents, Congress and the executive branch convulsed into action." [...] Three separate bodies just described were created to further this investigation. The report was suppressed from the start but <b>was</b> leaked by <b>Daniel</b> <b>Schorr</b> to the Village Voice who asked the publication to give to his legal defense fund, which was refused. Schorr showed the [...] "committee report...on television and discussed its contents," [...] resulting in his resignation from CBS and to his death, refusing [...] "to identify his source for the Pike committee report." ...|$|R
