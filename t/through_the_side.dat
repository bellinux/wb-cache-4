5|$|Croatian forces adapted several Antonov An-2 biplanes to drop {{supplies}} by parachute on Vukovar. The aircraft also dropped improvised bombs made of fuel {{cans and}} boilers filled with explosive and metal bars. The crews used GPS to locate their targets, then pushed ordinance <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> door. One {{of the aircraft}} was shot down by an SA-6 missile, killing Marko Živković, {{the commander of the}} air unit.|$|E
5|$|After Paul {{wakes up}} and {{mentions}} that he argued with Diana, an anonymous caller informs Diana of what Paul said and she begins packing. Mark and his team arrive at her hotel, but they find the room is empty. Diana goes {{to the hospital to}} see Paul, he tries to call for help, but he is too weak. Diana tells him that she did not push him, but if she did, he would be in the morgue. She asks him to tell the truth and do the right thing, before leaving <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> entrance of the room.|$|E
5|$|Like most flight {{instructors}} giving dual instruction, Reid {{was seated}} on the right side, while the aircraft's primary flight instruments were mounted on the left, in front of Dubroff in this case. Investigators speculated {{that because of the}} heavy rain in his immediate climb path, Reid's forward visibility became greatly restricted. To maintain control through the climbing right turn, {{he would have had to}} turn his head to the left to see the flight instruments (most critically the attitude and airspeed indicators) and to the right to see the ground <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> window. Such side-to-side head motion, combined with the worsening flight visibility during the climb and the reduced stall margin, could have led to spatial disorientation and loss of control.|$|E
50|$|Additional archways {{were added}} in 1764 and 1774. In 1765, a passage was cut <b>through</b> <b>the</b> eastern <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> arch for pedestrians. A further passage <b>through</b> <b>the</b> western <b>side</b> was added later.|$|R

50|$|Old Town's {{northern}} boundary is <b>the</b> northern <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> Malacky - Bratislava railway line, {{it continues}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{eastern part of}} Opavská Street, it crosses the Limbová Street at {{the place of the}} underpass underneath the railway tracks, continues <b>through</b> <b>the</b> northern <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> railway line and <b>the</b> southern <b>side</b> of Opavská Street. At the crossing of Opavská Street and Ďurgalova Street it bends northwards and continues <b>through</b> <b>the</b> northern <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> Pražská Street, it crosses the Stromová Street and again continies <b>through</b> <b>the</b> northern <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> Malacky - Bratislava railway line. The boundary then continues around the northern edge of the Bratislava hlavná stanica and at the crossing of Jaskov Rad Street and Pod Strážami Street it turns to the southeast. It continues <b>through</b> <b>the</b> western <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> underpass underneath the railway tracks and then it turns to the northeast and continues <b>through</b> <b>the</b> northern <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> Dobšinského Street until its crossing with Smrečianska Street.|$|R
5|$|Nevada {{became a}} prime target for Japanese Val dive bombers {{during the second}} wave. Japanese pilots {{intended}} to sink her in the channel ostensibly to block the harbor. Tactically target selection was wrong as 14–18 dive bombers attacking her wouldn't be able to sink a battleship with 250kg bombs and the channel's width of 1200 feet made the idea of bottling up the harbor impossible. As she steamed past Ten-Ten Dock at about 09:50, Nevada was struck by five bombs. One exploded over the crew's galley at Frame 80. Another struck the port director platform and exploded {{at the base of}} the stack on the upper deck. Yet another hit near No. 1 turret inboard from the port waterway and blew large holes in the upper and main decks. Two struck the forecastle near Frame 15; one passed out <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the second deck before exploding, but the other exploded within the ship near the gasoline tank; leakage and vapors from this tank caused intense fires around the ship.|$|E

25|$|To {{construct}} the Klein Bottle, glue the red arrows {{of the square}} together (left and right sides), resulting in a cylinder. To glue {{the ends of the}} cylinder together so that the arrows on the circles match, you must pass one end <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the cylinder. Note that this creates a circle of self-intersection - this is an immersion of the Klein bottle in three dimensions.|$|E

25|$|Direction {{relative}} to the aircraft and cockpit. A beam aimed directly at an incoming aircraft gives the greatest risk to pilots. One aimed across the aircraft's travel gives less risk, partially because the light enters <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> windows, and partially because {{it is harder to}} keep the beam aimed exactly at the cockpit area. A beam aimed straight up gives the least risk, although it is still possible for the beam to illuminate the cockpit during a banking turn.|$|E

The Cloisters medieval art museum, {{a branch of the}} Metropolitan Museum of Art, is located in the park, about a 10-minute walk north from the station's Fort Washington Avenue exit. An additional exit <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the hill leads to Bennett Avenue and provides access to the Broadway Valley area of Washington Heights.|$|E
25|$|On July 28, 1945, a B-25 Mitchell bomber {{crashed into}} {{the north side of}} the Empire State Building, between the 79th and 80th floors. One engine shot <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> {{opposite}} the impact and flew as far as the next block, while the other engine and part of the landing gear plummeted down an elevator shaft. Fourteen people were killed in the incident. However, the building was not severely damaged or structurally compromised, and it reopened two days later.|$|E

25|$|A {{bloomery}} {{is basically}} an enlarged blacksmith's hearth. It {{consists of a}} pit or chimney with heat-resistant walls made of earth, clay, or stone. (Sandstone was used at Cornwall.) Near the bottom, one or more clay pipes enter <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> walls. These pipes, called tuyeres, allow air to enter the furnace, either by natural draft or by forced with a bellows. An opening {{at the bottom of}} the bloomery may be used to remove the bloom, or the bloomery can be tipped over and the bloom removed from the bottom.|$|E
25|$|The pyramid {{courtyard}} was accessed {{either from}} the transverse corridor or <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> entrance of the mortuary temple via a portico with two round columns bearing Sahure's name and titles. No building seems to have stood in this courtyard. At the base of northern side of the pyramid was a passage leading to a T-shaped underground chamber, oriented on an east–west axis and under {{the tip of the}} pyramid. No artifacts were found onsite during the excavation of this chamber which might have housed a statue of Sahure's Ka.|$|E
25|$|The {{farmer and}} farmhands rescued the injured {{people from the}} wrecked aircraft. Two of the {{passengers}} were able to extricate themselves from the wreckage but the other 11 passengers were more seriously injured. They had been thrown forwards in the accident, one woman had been forced <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the fuselage. The local doctor attended and assisted in the evacuation of the injured from the scene. Hurdles were improvised as makeshift stretchers and the injured were taken into the barn until ambulances arrived from Ashford, Hythe and Lympne. They were taken to hospital in Folkestone.

25|$|The {{maturation}} of {{the insect}} (from egg to adult) lasts between 24 and 45 days, varying {{according to the}} weather. Usually, the female drills the berry through the central disc, although it can enter <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> walls if the fruit is dry. Two days after the access, the beetle lays 35–50 eggs, which produce 13 females for each male. The lifespan for females is 35–190 days and for males 40 days. The new insects mate inside the seed. Some females lay the eggs in the same coffee plant, others colonise new ones. The males never leave the fruit.|$|E
25|$|On 19 September 1936, while {{preparing}} for the race, Tom Campbell Black was killed at the U.K's Liverpool, Speke Airport, in a ground collision with another aircraft. A RAF bomber that had landed ran into Black's Mew Gull as he taxiied out for take off. Black was reputed to have been {{looking down at his}} map at the time. The propeller of the large biplane tore <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of Black's cockpit, striking and mortally wounding him in the chest and shoulder. He died on the way to hospital. He left a widow, the English actress Florence Desmond, whom he had married in 1935.|$|E
25|$|Five Mexican {{troops were}} killed and sixteen were wounded. The Texians lost seven killed and {{fourteen}} wounded. One of the Texian casualties was the seaman from the Brazoria. When the battle began, Russell had sent the seaman below decks {{so that he would}} be safe. The man was killed when a Mexican cannon shot crashed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the ship. The sustained bombardment had damaged the Brazoria, making it ineffective for transportation of the cannon. The Texians regrouped and prepared to march overland to Anahuac. As they readied for departure, they learned that Bradburn had resigned his position and the prisoners had been released. Austin and his men chose to remain in Brazoria.|$|E
