5|$|Several novels, {{books and}} poems were {{generated}} {{as a consequence}} of the Klondike gold rush. The writer Jack London incorporated scenes from the gold rush into his novels set in the Klondike, including The Call of the Wild, a novel about a sledge dog. His colleague, poet Robert W. Service, did not join the rush himself, although he made his home in Dawson City in 1908. Service created well-known poems about the gold rush, among them Songs of a Sourdough, one of the bestselling books of poetry in the first decade of the 20th century, along with his novel, The Trail of '98, which was written by hand on wallpaper in one of Dawson's log cabins. The Canadian historian Pierre Berton grew up in Dawson where his father had been a prospector, and wrote several historical books about the gold rush, such as The Last Great Gold Rush. The experiences of the Irish Micí Mac Gabhann resulted the posthumous work Rotha Mór an tSaoil (translated into English as The Hard Road <b>to</b> <b>Klondike</b> in 1962), a vivid description of the period.|$|E

Now I'm going <b>to</b> <b>Klondike.</b> Ain't nothing can stop me, ain't nothing at all.

I'm going to get three hundred {{thousand}} outa the ground, too. Ain't a thing can stop me, ain't a thing, because I just naturally need the money. I don't mind a bad temper so long's the boy is square. I'll take my chance, an' I'll work along with you till we catch up with him. Then, if he says no to the proposition, I reckon I'll lose. But somehow I just can't see 'm sayin' no, because that'd mean too close up to freeze-up and too late for me to find another chance like this. And, as I'm sure going to get <b>to</b> <b>Klondike,</b> it's just plumb {{impossible for him to}} say no." ...|$|E

50|$|A {{certain amount}} of slang {{came out of the}} gold rush. Experienced miners were often known as Sourdoughs.

60|$|Well, I {{wiped my}} eyes and {{polished}} up my specs, but I might have spared myself the trouble, for in five minutes, Nora May, there was I sobbing again; over Gilbert's letter. By the most curious coincidence he had opened his heart to me too. Being a man, he wasn't so discursive as Anne; he said his say in four pages, but I could read the heartache between the lines. He wrote {{that he was going}} <b>to</b> <b>Klondike</b> and would start in a month's time. He was sick of living now that he'd lost Anne. He said he loved her better than his life and always would, and could never forget her, but he knew she didn't care anything about him now after the way she'd acted, and he wanted to get as far away from her and the torturing thought of her as he could. So he was going to Klondike--going <b>to</b> <b>Klondike,</b> Nora May, when his mother was writing to him to come home every week and Anne was breaking her heart for him at St. Mary's.|$|E
60|$|Thus it was, when Jack Coughran unburdened himself next day, that Dawson fell to {{wondering}} {{who was this}} David Payne, and in what way his existence bore upon Karen Sayther's. But that very day, as Pierre Fontaine had said, Mrs. Sayther and her barbaric crew of voyageurs towed up the east bank <b>to</b> <b>Klondike</b> City, shot across {{to the west bank}} to escape the bluffs, and disappeared amid the maze of islands to the south.|$|E

I had to hide, so I ran away <b>to</b> <b>Klondike.</b> And--well, Tom Daw found me playing whist in a cabin down on the Yukon." ...|$|E

Twice he {{attempted}} to cross the trailless icejams of the river, still resolutely followed, and both times he gave up {{and returned to the}} Dawson shore. Straight down Main Street he trudged, crossing the ice of Klondike River <b>to</b> <b>Klondike</b> City and again retracing to Dawson. At eight o'clock, as gray dawn began to show, he led his weary gang to Slavovitch's restaurant, where tables were at a premium for breakfast.|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, it's this way," [...] Anson said. [...] "We've divided our leadership. We've got specialities. Now I'm a carpenter.

So he'll boss getting out the logs and all mining operations. Most of our outfit's ahead. We went broke paying the Indians to pack that much of {{it to the top of}} Chilcoot. Our last partner is up there with it, moving it along by himself down the other side. His name's Liverpool, and he's a sailor. So, when the boat's built, he's the boss of the outfit to navigate the lakes and rapids <b>to</b> <b>Klondike.</b>|$|E

I'm going over <b>to</b> <b>Klondike</b> City. There's an old man there, with a bad leg, who's broke and who has six dozen. He's held them all winter for the rise, intending to get enough out of them to pay his passage back to Seattle. I'll see he gets his passage, and I'll get the eggs. Now hustle. And they say that little woman down beyond the sawmill who makes moccasins has a couple of dozen." ...|$|E

60|$|Again the Northland {{turned the}} tables. The Alaskan gold hunter is proverbial, {{not so much}} for his unveracity, as for his {{inability}} to tell the precise truth. In a country of exaggerations, he likewise is prone to hyperbolic description of things actual. But when it came <b>to</b> <b>Klondike,</b> he could not stretch the truth as fast as the truth itself stretched. Carmack first got a dollar pan. He lied when he said it was two dollars and a half. And when those who doubted him did get two-and-a-half pans, they said they were getting an ounce, and lo! ere the lie had fairly started on its way, they were getting, not one ounce, but five ounces. This they claimed was six ounces; but when they filled a pan of dirt to prove the lie, they washed out twelve ounces. And so it went. They continued valiantly to lie, but the truth continued to outrun them.|$|E

I came over Chilcoot Pass with two {{thousand}} letters for Dawson. I was letter carrier. Everybody rush <b>to</b> <b>Klondike</b> at that time. Many people on trail. Many people chop down trees and make boats. Last water, snow in the air, snow on the ground, ice on the lake, on the river ice in the eddies. Every day more snow, more ice. Maybe one day, maybe three days, maybe six days, any day maybe freeze-up come, then no more water, all ice, everybody walk, Dawson six hundred miles, long time walk. Boat go very quick. Everybody want to go boat. Everybody say, 'Charley, two hundred dollars you take me in canoe,' 'Charley, three hundred dollars,' 'Charley, four hundred dollars.' I say no, all the time I say no. I am letter carrier.|$|E
