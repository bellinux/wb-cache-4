5|$|The Church Rooms in Park Road {{were also}} a primary school until 1896 when the Board School was opened next door. Older pupils had to travel <b>to</b> <b>secondary</b> schools in Penarth by train. The {{part-time}} Radyr Library serves the area.|$|E

5|$|After the Bergen Line was electrified, {{the work}} {{continued}} on the Dovre Line. The section from Hamar to Otta was finished in 1967, {{and the following}} year to Dombås. This allowed the locomotives to be transferred <b>to</b> <b>secondary</b> lines. With the final delivery of the last units in 1969 and {{the completion of the}} electrification of the Dovre Line in 1970, the final steam locomotive was taken out of service. During {{the last half of the}} 1960s, the Di 3 was put into service on the Rauma Line, the Røros Line, the Solør Line, the Valdres Line and the Meråker Line.|$|E

5|$|All {{the veins}} {{of the wing}} are subject <b>to</b> <b>secondary</b> forking and to union by cross-veins. In some orders of insects the cross-veins are so {{numerous}} that the whole venational pattern becomes a close network of branching veins and cross-veins. Ordinarily, however, there is a definite number of cross-veins having specific locations. The more constant cross-veins are the humeral cross-vein (h) between costa and subcosta, the radial cross-vein (r) between R and the first fork of Rs, the sectorial cross-vein (s) between the two forks of R8, the median cross-vein (m–m) between M2 and M3, and the mediocubital cross-vein (m-cu) between media and cubitus.|$|E
5|$|Amazone {{served in}} the {{reconnaissance}} forces of the High Seas Fleet during her peacetime career. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, she was deployed as a coastal defense ship. In 1916, she was disarmed and used as a training ship, and was converted into a barracks ship in 1917. She was retained by the Reichsmarine {{after the end of}} the war and served on active duty with the new German Navy through the 1920s. She was reduced <b>to</b> <b>secondary</b> duties after 1931, and remained in service as a barracks ship into the 1950s; Amazone was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1954.|$|E
5|$|At {{the angle}} of each aisle, a spiral {{staircase}} – still visible {{on each side of}} the surviving east wall – gave access to a passage inside the walls and <b>to</b> <b>secondary</b> stairs within the angles of the main gable enabling access to all parts of the building for maintenance and cleaning without requiring scaffolding. Nothing remains of the north or south transepts, which extended on the north side beyond the present boundary wall into the graveyard of St Nicholas's Church.|$|E

5|$|Both ships {{served in}} the East Asia station with the East Asia Squadron; Prinzess Wilhelm {{played a major role}} in the seizure of the Kiautschou Bay {{concession}} in November 1897. Both ships returned to Germany at the turn of the 20th century, and remained in European waters until 1914, when they were removed from active service. They were reduced <b>to</b> <b>secondary</b> roles then, and continued to serve until the early 1920s, when they were sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|By 1 October 1930 252 I-3s were {{in service}} and 282 a year later. 297 {{were on hand}} on 1 January 1932, {{although}} it fell to 249 a year later and 239 {{towards the end of}} 1933. It was relegated <b>to</b> <b>secondary</b> roles in 1935 as newer and more powerful Polikarpov fighters entered service, notably the I-5, I-15, and the I-16.|$|E
5|$|By 1914, Hydra and Psara {{had been}} reduced <b>to</b> <b>secondary</b> duties: Hydra became a gunnery {{training}} ship while Psara was used to train engine-room personnel. During World War I, Greece belatedly entered the war {{on the side of}} the Triple Entente and the Hydra-class ships served as coastal defense. They were already obsolete and were decommissioned immediately after the war, although their hulks survived as naval training facilities and accommodation space for a decade. All three ships were broken up for scrap in 1929.|$|E

5|$|By World War I, most of {{the ships}} had been {{withdrawn}} <b>to</b> <b>secondary</b> roles, with Elba having {{been converted into a}} seaplane tender. Puglia was {{the only member of the}} class to take an active role, based out of Durazzo. Etruria was deliberately blown up by the Regia Marina as a deception operation against Austria-Hungary. The remaining ships were broken up for scrap in the early 1920s, though the bow section of Puglia was preserved at the Vittoriale degli italiani museum.|$|E
5|$|Giovanni Bausan {{frequently}} served abroad. She {{participated in}} the conquest of Eritrea in 188788 as the flagship of the Italian squadron during the campaign. She {{took part in the}} Venezuelan crisis of 1902–03 alongside British and German warships. During the Italo-Turkish War of 191112, she provided gunfire support to Italian troops ashore in North Africa. By the outbreak of the First World War, Giovanni Bausan had been relegated <b>to</b> <b>secondary</b> duties, first as a distilling ship, and later as a depot ship for seaplanes. The ship was disarmed during the conflict and ultimately was sold to ship-breakers in March 1920.|$|E
5|$|Grosser Kurfürst {{was lost}} in 1878 during {{maneuvers}} shortly after her commissioning, when a pair of small sailing boats crossed the bows of Grosser Kurfürst and , which caused both ships to undertake emergency maneuvers. In the confusion, König Wilhelm collided with Grosser Kurfürst, causing the latter to sink. Both Preussen and Friedrich der Grosse served in the fleet until the 1890s, when they were relegated <b>to</b> <b>secondary</b> duties, including serving as harbor ships, and later as coal hulks. The ships were eventually scrapped {{following the end of}} World War I, in 1919 and 1920, respectively.|$|E

We report the case of a middle aged male presenting with right sided neck pain and arm swelling <b>secondary</b> <b>to</b> ipsilateral jugular-subclavian deep vein thrombosis.

5|$|In {{osteochondritis}} dissecans, {{fragments of}} cartilage or bone become loose within a joint, leading to pain and inflammation. These fragments are {{sometimes referred to}} as joint mice. OCD is a type of osteochondrosis in which a lesion has formed within the cartilage layer itself, giving rise <b>to</b> <b>secondary</b> inflammation. OCD most commonly affects the knee, although it can affect other joints such as the ankle or the elbow.|$|E
5|$|Music {{is a part}} of the {{curriculum}} at public schools in Saint Lucia; it has long been taught in younger grade levels, but was only introduced <b>to</b> <b>secondary</b> education in 1999. Primary education on Saint Lucia, music and other artistic education is commonly used incidentally to teaching other subjects or for special occasions. About 40% of the island's schools engage in general music education, while others spent more time on general group singing or choir, or recorder ensemble performance. In 2003, a string program was instituted for primary students.|$|E
5|$|Secondary {{progressive}} MS {{occurs in}} around 65% {{of those with}} initial relapsing-remitting MS, who eventually have progressive neurologic decline between acute attacks without any definite periods of remission.

5|$|The 1865 decree for the revamp of {{secondary}} education brought about major developments for UST. It was tasked as a Bureau of Education with the Rector as its director.

5|$|The Gunn {{family home}} in Thurso was a farm, and the young Bryan would often pester the farmhands to play {{football}} with him. They would use a turnip if no ball was available. By the age of four he was keen on goalkeeping; he was fearless of injury and enjoyed diving on the ball. When Bryan was four-and-a-half, {{the family moved to}} Invergordon, 20 miles from Inverness. He attended Park Primary School in the town and joined the school football team. Future professional Bobby Geddes was favoured over him as first-choice goalkeeper for the team; Gunn played as an outfield player until Geddes moved on <b>to</b> <b>secondary</b> school.|$|E
