5|$|Little {{was known}} about {{the cause of the}} disease until 1903 when Adelchi Negri (1876–1912) first saw {{microscopic}} lesions– now called Negri bodies– in the brains of rabid animals. He wrongly thought they were protozoan parasites. Paul Remlinger (1871–1964) soon showed by filtration experiments that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>much</b> smaller than protozoa, and even smaller than bacteria. Thirty years later, Negri bodies were shown to be accumulations of particles 100–150nanometres long, now known to be the size of rhabdovirus particles– the virus that causes rabies.|$|E
5|$|In 1515, Pope Leo X {{granted a}} plenary indulgence {{intended}} {{to finance the}} construction of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. It would apply to almost any sin, including adultery and theft. All other indulgence preaching was to cease for the eight years {{in which it was}} offered. Indulgence preachers were given strict instructions on how the indulgence was to be preached, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>much</b> more laudatory of the indulgence than those of earlier indulgences. Johann Tetzel was commissioned to preach and offer the indulgence in 1517, and his campaign in cities near Wittenberg drew many Wittenbergers to travel to these cities and purchase them, since sales had been prohibited in Wittenberg and other Saxon cities.|$|E
5|$|The initial French {{attack was}} aimed at seizing the three Russian {{positions}} collectively known as the Bagration flèches, four arrow-head shaped, open-backed earthworks which arced out to the left en échelon {{in front of the}} Kolocha stream. These positions helped support the Russian left, which had no terrain advantages. There was much to be desired {{in the construction of the}} flèches, one officer noting that the ditches were much too shallow, the embrasures open to the ground, making them easy to enter, and that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>much</b> too wide exposing infantry inside them. The flèches were supported by artillery from the village of Semyanovskaya, whose elevation dominated the other side of the Kolocha.|$|E

5|$|British trad jazz band-leader Chris Barber {{was one of}} {{the major}} figures in the {{development}} and popularisation of rhythm and blues in Britain the 1950s. His interest in the blues would help foster both the skiffle craze and the development of electric rhythm and blues, as members of his dance band would be fundamental to both movements. He founded the National Jazz League partly as a means of popularising the blues, served as co-director of the National Jazz Federation and helped establish the Marquee Club, which would become one of the major venues for British R bands. He also brought over American folk and blues performers who found <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>much</b> better known and paid in Europe than America, a series of tours that began with Josh White and Big Bill Broonzy in 1951, and would include Brownie McGhee, Sonny Terry, Memphis Slim, Muddy Waters and Lonnie Johnson.|$|E
5|$|Nationwide strikes {{broke out}} {{in the spring and summer}} of 1988. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>much</b> weaker than the strikes of 1980 and were {{discontinued}} after the intervention by Wałęsa, who secured the regime's commitment to begin negotiations with the opposition. The strikes were the last act of active political involvement of the working class in the history of People's Poland and were led by young workers, not connected to Solidarity veterans and opposed to socially harmful consequences of the economic restructuring in progress at that time. According to the researcher Maciej Gdula, the political activity that followed was conducted exclusively by the elites. It was neither inspired by nor consulted with any mass social organization or movement, as the opposition leading circles freed themselves from their strong in the past commitment to the welfare of working people. No longer secure as undisputed leaders, Polish dissidents of the KOR-Solidarity generations were eager to bargain with the weakened regime whose economic goals they now shared.|$|E

Although the extent of operations launched against Greek Cypriots was far smaller than those against the British military, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>much</b> more efficient. In total, 230 assassination attempts were attributed to EOKA action. Of those, only 13 targets escaped unharmed, whilst 148 Greek Cypriots were killed and 69 were wounded.|$|E
25|$|During the English Conquest of Ireland, {{only the}} nobility {{were allowed to}} own Irish Wolfhounds, the numbers {{permitted}} depending on position. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>much</b> coveted and were frequently given as gifts to important personages and foreign nobles. Wolfhounds were the companions of the regal, and were housed themselves alongside them. King John of England, in about 1210 presented an Irish hound, Gelert to Llewellyn, a prince of Wales. The poet The Hon William Robert Spencer immortalised this hound in a poem.|$|E
25|$|The {{entire process}} was {{undertaken}} {{with the utmost}} secrecy, {{as much for the}} public as for the accused, who were not informed about the accusations that were levied against them. Months or even years could pass without the accused being informed about why they were imprisoned. The prisoners remained isolated, and, during this time, the prisoners were not allowed to attend Mass nor receive the sacraments. The jails of the Inquisition were no worse than those of secular authorities, and there are even certain testimonies that occasionally <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>much</b> better.|$|E

25|$|In massive stars, {{the core}} is already large enough {{at the onset}} of the {{hydrogen}} burning shell that helium ignition will occur before electron degeneracy pressure has a chance to become prevalent. Thus, when these stars expand and cool, they do not brighten as much as lower-mass stars; however, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>much</b> brighter than lower-mass stars to begin with, and are thus still brighter than the red giants formed from less-massive stars. These stars are unlikely to survive as red supergiants; instead they will destroy themselves as type II supernovas.|$|E
25|$|Extendable Ears {{are long}} flesh-coloured strings, {{one end of}} which is {{inserted}} into a user's ear and the other end placed further away towards a conversation or sound. Much like a listening device, the user {{will be able to}} hear the sounds as if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>much</b> closer to the source. They were first introduced by Fred and George Weasley in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, when they used the ears to listen to the Order's meetings, until one was destroyed (and eaten) by Crookshanks.|$|E
25|$|The {{main port}} of entry for trading {{purposes}} was Monterey, where custom duties of up to 100% (also called tariffs) were applied. These high duties gave rise to much bribery and smuggling, as avoiding the tariffs made more money for the ship owners and made the goods less costly to the customers. Essentially all {{the cost of the}} California government (what little there was) was paid for by these tariffs. In this <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>much</b> like the United States in 1850, where about 89% of the revenue of its federal government came from import tariffs, although at an average rate of about 20%.|$|E
