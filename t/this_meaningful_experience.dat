40|$|In {{this article}} we examine the {{educational}} process and learning from the edusemiotic {{point of view in}} terms of <b>meaningful</b> <b>experience</b> and <b>meaningful</b> action. A conception of <b>meaningful</b> <b>experience</b> is central in many branches of educational thinking, from pragmatism to existentialism. We analyze this conception from two traditional and somewhat remote perspectives, utilizing some themes of Kant’s educational philosophy {{on the one hand and}} Greimas’ semiotics on the other. Kant’s views of human formative powers – Bildung – will be described as a basic philosophy of learning experience. Kant’s theory is then critiqued from the perspective of existentialist educational philosophy. Concepts of <b>meaningful</b> learning and <b>experience</b> are further clarified utilizing Greimas’ semiotic tools and, specifically, his semiotic square. Finally, the question of <b>meaningful</b> learning <b>experience</b> is related to Kant’s pedagogical paradox and the educator’s role in the pedagogical process...|$|R

40|$|Outdoor educators, nature-based tourism {{guides and}} private recreationalists {{make use of}} {{wilderness}} river areas for extended journeys. The justification for running such trips commonly involves the potential ‘experience’ that it affords participants. Yet the experiences themselves are often unique, individual and difficult to describe. While ‘the experience’ is commonly used as a justification for such journeys, experience itself does not always appear to be well understood or easily articulated. This research project explores participant descriptions of <b>meaningful</b> <b>experiences</b> on a wilderness river journey, in order {{to answer the questions}} ‘what forms of <b>meaningful</b> <b>experiences</b> might occur on a wilderness river journey?’, ‘what components of the journey facilitate those meaningful experiences?’, ‘what {{is the role of the}} wilderness landscape itself in facilitating those experiences?’, and ‘what is the potential value of <b>meaningful</b> wilderness <b>experiences</b> subsequent upon returning to everyday life?’. The research uses a phenomenological approach to elucidate individual perceptions of <b>meaningful</b> <b>experiences,</b> and then combines the recollections to reveal the commonalities within those experiences. Using interviews, journals, observations and follow-up emails from 32 participants on eight Franklin River (ten day) trips, the project moves from the individual to the collective, to identify and describe the qualities and essences of <b>meaningful</b> <b>experiences</b> on a wilderness river journey. The research identifies two recurrent key ‘streams of experience’. These involve a feeling of humility and being alive to the present. By interrogating the thematic structure of participant descriptions surrounding these two streams of experience, invariant structures are revealed. These invariant structures further provide the opportunity to refocus on individual participant descriptions, and illuminate the essential qualities of the phenomena described. It is argued that by understanding potentially <b>meaningful</b> <b>experiences</b> on a wilderness river journey, outdoor educators, commercial guides and facilitators will be better able to make use of surrounding environs to facilitate such experiences. There is a focus on the unique elements of the wilderness river journey that, in this research, contributed to the unique experiences which participants valued as meaningful...|$|R

The report tries to examine how, a yet not established company (A Friend of Wine), can develop a <b>meaningful</b> <b>experience</b> design. The main research question is; What to be observant of, {{in order to create}} a sustainable experience design? The report is based on the phenomenology-hermeneutical science, by Dourish and Heidegger, which advocates, finding meaning in the real world, instead of reducing it, by applying theories and analytical tools on how to discover a <b>meaningful</b> <b>experience.</b> The project group hosted two wine tasting sessions, to figure out how to create a deeper understanding of wine, through instruments, such as meaning and learning. After the sessions, the project group applied design theories to explain why the participants acted and reacted the way that they did. Theories used are, Pine and Gilmores look on the Experience Economy, Christian Jantzens stimulation and gratification and Albert Boswijks theory on the <b>Meaningful</b> <b>Experience.</b> When trying to apply the theories, the project group discovered that theories and models couldn’t explain how to make a sustainable design; you have to study the design through interaction with people, in an ongoing situation...|$|R

40|$|Through its ostensibly {{philosophical}} {{rhetoric and}} multiple allusions, Four Quartets manifests a continuity between Eliot’s poetic thought and his early engagement with philosophy. The thematic {{core of this}} continuity is Eliot’s concern with the <b>meaningful</b> <b>experience</b> of reality, described as equally dependent on direct perception and on linguistic structure: language shapes perception into a <b>meaningful</b> world-vision, while <b>experience</b> itself is an ongoing process of interpreting (or signifying) that which is perceived. This link empowers poetic language, entangling the reading consciousness in a process to which Husserl’s descriptions of consciousness refer as “sense-giving. ” Four Quartets epitomizes both the phenomenological description and the poetic enactment of <b>meaningful</b> <b>experience.</b> Its opening movement both mimics the structure of experienced reality and keeps the reading eye {{in the process of}} making sense in its full complexity, involving all faculties of apprehending reality, from the metaphysical logo-centric systems underlying conceptual understanding of the world to the direct sensuous perception of immediate environment.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to clarify the {{characteristics}} and issues of Siedentop’s theory “Physical Education as Play Education”. In this study, Siedentop’s literature “Physical Education―Introductory Analysis―from the 1 st edition to the third edition” were mainly analyzed. At first, we examined Siedentop’s basic stance, and then we thought about the theoretic structure of his work. The results of this study, the following two characteristics were clarified. 1. Siedentop argued that physical activities are one of “play” and it is more important to give the <b>meaningful</b> <b>experiences</b> in “play” to students in PE class. 2. It is especially important to develop skills in PE class, if the students have <b>meaningful</b> <b>experiences</b> in “play”. The following two points were issues in his theory. 3.

40|$|In {{a modern}} society like ours, there is quest for {{something}} intangible. <b>Meaningful</b> <b>experiences</b> are valuable to {{us, and we}} are willing to pay to get them. Since Pine and Gilmore in 1999 introduced the world to the concept of 'experience economy', there have been many books written on the subject. Despite this, there is no clear definition of the main term. In this thesis, I aim create an overview of the different understandings of the word ‘experience’ and ‘meaningful experience’. If you ask anybody between the age of 5 and 30 about Experimentarium, you will find that almost all, have had an experience they can remember and still talk about 10 - 15 years later. Thus Experimentarium succeeds in creating an experience that is so special that it is remembered. And a memorable experience sometimes leads to a <b>meaningful</b> <b>experience.</b> Through my theoretical framework of understanding, I analyse two installations at Experimentarium, to investigate how Experimentarium uses <b>meaningful</b> <b>experiences.</b> <b>This</b> research question will be illustrated with empirical studies of the visitors at Experimentarium City, as well as interviews with two young boys, regarding their experience at Experimentarium five months prior. The thesis finds that there is a challenge in experiences being entertaining, educational, as well as immersive. Experimentarium has many different installations, and therefore has many different experiences to offer. As every individual have a different perception of meaningful, it is impossible to create an installation that is meaningful for everybody...|$|R
