25|$|By 1860 Charlotte {{had been}} dead for five years, and the only people living at the parsonage were Mr. Brontë, his son-in-law, Arthur Bell Nicholls, and two servants. In 1857 Mrs. Gaskell's {{biography}} of Charlotte was published and <b>though</b> <b>Mr.</b> Brontë at its first reading approved of its commissioning, several months later he expressed doubts. The portrait of Nicholls, founded partly on the confidence of Ellen Nussey, seemed to him to be unjustified. Ellen Nussey, who hated Arthur, insists that his marital claims had perverted Charlotte's writing and she had to struggle against an interruption of her career. It is true that Arthur found Nussey to be too close to his wife, and he insisted that she should destroy her letters – although this never actually happened.|$|E

He counts the bunnies in what is presumably a Scottish accent: [...] "six leetle fat rabbits", and argues with his wife about buying [...] "baccy". These and Mrs. McGregor's claim that he has tricked her and [...] "done it a purpose" [...] demonstrate Potter's attention to using dialect and dialogue as a means of defining character [...] in this instance, of contrasting their manner of speaking with her own in narrating the story.|$|E

Alan Ball also alleged that Revie made an illegal approach for him, and despite pocketing the £300 bribe he instead signed for Everton instead of Leeds; both men were charged with bringing the game into disrepute. The allegations of corruption earned him the nickname of [...] "Don Readies". <b>Though</b> <b>Mr</b> Justice Cantley lifted the FA's ten-year ban on Revie, during his conclusion of the case the judge said that Revie [...] "lacked candour", was [...] "greedy" [...] and [...] "prickly", focused on [...] "imagined wrongs" [...] and his resignation as England manager showed a [...] "sensational, outrageous example of disloyalty, breach of trust, discourtesy and selfishness".|$|E

Realizing this, Alan sets his sights on moving out to accomplish things on his own, with Charlie seemingly supporting the idea, but has since chosen to stay as he favors his son's company. Recently, Charlie is bothered by his father trying to impose his will on him with maintaining the house, as he is a full tenured professor at one of the most prestigious institutions in the country working on [...] "life-altering" [...] mathematics, i.e., in solving crimes. Alan just wants him to be responsible and not end up like Larry, <b>though</b> <b>Mr.</b> Eppes respects Fleinhardt. Even he has thought of this possibility and decides to do more around the home. After Charlie compares his own situation to that of Einstein his father looks into information on the physicist and understands his son's predicament. Charlie also feels guilty about the amount of time his parents, particularly his mother, who always was attuned to his way of thinking, spent with him as a child; he even asks his mother (JoBeth Williams) in a dream if she regrets the time away from Don and Alan because of the special attention he needed growing up.|$|E
2500|$|Much like a contract, express trusts {{are usually}} formed {{based on the}} {{expressed}} intentions {{of a person who}} owns some property to in future have it managed by a trustee, and used for another person's benefit. Often the courts see cases where people have recently died, and expressed a wish to use property for another person, but have not used legal terminology. In principle, this does not matter. In Paul v Constance, Mr Constance had recently split up with his wife, and began to live with Ms Paul, who he played bingo with. Because of their close relationship, Mr Constance had often repeated that the money in his bank account, partly from bingo winnings and from a workplace accident, was [...] "as much yours as mine". When Mr Constance died, his old wife claimed the money still belonged to her, but the Court of Appeal held that despite the lack of formal wording, and <b>though</b> <b>Mr</b> Constance had retained the legal title to the money, it was held on trust for him and Ms Paul. As Scarman LJ put it, they understood [...] "very well indeed their own domestic situation", and even though legal terms were not used in substance this did [...] "convey clearly a present declaration that the existing fund was as much" [...] belonging to Ms Paul. As Lord Millett later put it, if someone [...] "enters into arrangements which have the effect of creating a trust, it is not necessary that [...] he should appreciate that they do so." [...] The only thing {{that needs to be done}} further is that, if the settlor is not declaring herself or himself as the trustee, the property should be physically transferred to the new trustee for the trust to be properly [...] "constituted". The traditional reason for requiring a transfer of property to the trustee was that the doctrine of consideration demanded that property should be passed, and not just promised at some future date, unless something of value was given in return. The general trend in more recent cases, though is to be flexible in these requirements, because as Lord Browne-Wilkinson said, equity [...] "will not strive officiously to defeat a gift".|$|E

6000|$|... "It was clean, <b>though,</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Dr. dear," [...] said Susan. [...] "They ARE clean children. They {{may be very}} heedless and reckless, Mrs. Dr. dear, and I am {{not saying}} they are not, but they NEVER forget to wash behind their ears." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{constructive}} trusts {{that are}} usually seen as responding to consent (for instance, like a commercial contract), or [...] "intention" [...] are, first, agreements to convey property where all the formalities {{have not yet been}} completed. Under the doctrine of anticipation, if an agreement could be specifically enforced, before formalities are completed the agreement to transfer a property is regarded as effective in equity, and the property will be held on trust (unless this is expressly excluded by the agreement's terms). Second, when someone agrees to use property for another's benefit, or divide a property after purchase, but then goes back on the agreement, the courts will impose a constructive trust. In Binions v Evans when Mr and Mrs Binions bought a large property they promised the sellers that Mrs Evans could remain for life in her cottage. They subsequently tried to evict Mrs Evans, but Lord Denning MR held that their agreement had created a constructive trust, and so the property was not theirs to deal with. Third, gifts or trusts that are made without completing all formalities will be enforced under a constructive trust if {{it is clear that the}} person making the gift or trust manifested a true intention to do so. In the leading case, Pennington v Waine a lady named Ada Crampton had wished to transfer 400 shares to her nephew, Harold, had filled in a share transfer form and given it to Mr Pennington, the company's auditors, and had died before Mr Pennington had registered it. Ada's other family members claimed the shares still belonged to them, but the Court of Appeal held that even though not formally complete, the estate held the shares on constructive trust for Harold. Similarly, in T Choithram International SA v Pagarani the Privy Council held that Mr Pagarani's estate held money on constructive trust after he died for a new foundation, even <b>though</b> <b>Mr</b> Pagarani had not completed the trust deeds, because he had publicly announced his intention to hold the money on trust. Fourth, if a person who is about to die secretly declares that he wishes property to go to someone not named in a will, the executor holds that property on constructive trust. Similarly, fifth, if a person writes a [...] "mutual will" [...] with their partner, agreeing that their property will go to a particular beneficiary when they both die, the surviving person cannot simply change their mind and will hold the property on constructive trust for the party who was agreed.|$|E
