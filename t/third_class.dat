5|$|Early {{passenger}} carriages were of similar design {{to those used}} on railways in England at the time, holding eighteen passengers on first class carriages, and thirty on second class. <b>Third</b> <b>class</b> carriages originally had seats, but on 15 April 1840 a board decision declared that all future <b>third</b> <b>class</b> carriages were to be made without seats. All existing <b>third</b> <b>class</b> carriages also had their seats removed. A later board decision on 3 July 1840 ordered that <b>third</b> <b>class</b> carriages would be situated closest to the engine, followed by second class, with first class at the rear.|$|E
5|$|Titanics {{passengers}} numbered approximately 1,317people: 324 in First Class, 284 in Second Class, and 709 in <b>Third</b> <b>Class.</b> Of these, 869 (66%) {{were male}} and 447 (34%) female. There were 107 children aboard, {{the largest number}} of which were in <b>Third</b> <b>Class.</b> The ship was considerably under capacity on her maiden voyage, as she could accommodate 2,453 passengers—833 First Class, 614 Second Class, and 1,006 <b>Third</b> <b>Class.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} compete with rival {{shipping}} company Cunard, the White Star Line offered their steerage passengers modest luxuries, {{in the hopes that}} emigrants would write to relatives back home and encourage them to travel on White Star Line ships. <b>Third</b> <b>class</b> passengers had their own dining facilities, with chairs instead of benches, and meals prepared by the <b>third</b> <b>class</b> kitchen staff. On other liners, the steerage passengers would have been expected to bring their own food. Rather than dormitory-style sleeping areas, <b>third</b> <b>class</b> passengers had their own cabins. The single men and women were separated, women in the stern in two to six berth cabins, men in the bow in up to ten berth cabins, often shared with strangers. Each stateroom was fitted with wood panelling and beds with mattresses, blankets, pillows, electric lights, heat and a washbasin with running water, except for the bow cabins which did not have a private washbasin. Two public bathtubs were also provided, one for the men, the other for women.|$|E

5|$|<b>Third</b> <b>class</b> {{funerals}} were {{reserved for}} pauper funerals; those buried at parish expense {{in the section}} of the cemetery designated for that parish. Although the LNC was forbidden from using mass graves (other than the burial of next of kin in the same grave) and thus even the lowest class of funeral provided a separate grave for the deceased, <b>third</b> <b>class</b> funerals were not granted the right to erect a permanent memorial on the site. (The families of those buried could pay afterwards to upgrade a <b>third</b> <b>class</b> grave to a higher class if they later wanted to erect a memorial, but this practice was rare.) Despite this, Brookwood's pauper graves granted more dignity to the deceased than did other graveyards and cemeteries of the period, all of which other than Brookwood continued the practice of mass graves for the poor.|$|E

The <b>third</b> <b>class</b> stood in the last few ranks of a very large phalanx and were equipped in a similar manner to hastati, although they were more often than not relegated to providing missile support to the higher classes rather than fighting themselves. Penrose and Southern postulate that it is probable that engagements with the Samnites and a crushing defeat {{at the hands of the}} Gallic warlord Brennus, who both used lots of smaller military units rather than a few very large ones, taught the Romans the importance of flexibility and the inadequacy of the phalanx on the rough, hilly ground of central Italy.|$|E

5|$|In Montana, {{municipalities}} {{are divided}} into four classes by state statute based on their population. Members of the three largest classes are deemed cities, while {{the members of the}} fourth class are called towns. Cities and towns are classified {{at the time of their}} organization, and are reorganized when they change classification due to an increase or decrease in population. A place may incorporate as a town with the support of 300 electors or two-thirds of the registered electors. A municipality with a population between 1,000 and 5,000 people is a <b>Third</b> <b>Class</b> city. A municipality with a population between 5,000 and 10,000 people is a Second Class city. And a municipality with a population over 10,000 people is a First Class city. Under certain exceptions municipalities with a population of between 9,000 and 10,000 may elect by resolution to be either a First or Second Class city. Under similar exceptions municipalities with a population of between 5,000 and 7,500 may elect by resolution to be either a Second or <b>Third</b> <b>Class</b> city. Municipalities with a population of between 1,000 and 2,500 may by resolution be classified as either a town or <b>Third</b> <b>Class</b> city. Unincorporated places such as census-designated places fall outside this scheme, and are subject to county governance, and thus are not towns or cities.|$|E

Mentioned afforestation {{was located in}} northern aspect with 16 years old, plantation distance of 2 x 3 m and with 232 ha - 1 areas. In this study diameter at breast height, height, form factor, diameter increment and stand volume parameters were calculated. Statistical analysis was done by SPSS and EXELL software's in order to study the distribution of trees in diameter and height classes. Results of this research showed that diameter mean of trees were 12. 40, 12. 96 and 14. 42 cm at the first, second and <b>third</b> <b>classes</b> also, height mean were 7. 06, 7. 22 and 8. 02 m at the first, second and <b>third</b> <b>classes,</b> respectively.

5|$|Less than a {{third of}} those aboard Titanic survived the disaster. Some {{survivors}} died shortly afterwards; injuries and the effects of exposure caused the deaths of several of those brought aboard Carpathia. Of the groups shown in the table, 49% of the children, 26% of the female passengers, 82% of the male passengers and 78% of the crew died. The figures show stark differences in the survival rates of the different classes aboard Titanic, especially among women and children. Although less than 10percent of first- and second-class women (combined) were lost, 54% of those in <b>third</b> <b>class</b> died. Similarly, five of six first-class and all second-class children survived, but 52 of the 79 in <b>third</b> <b>class</b> perished. The only first-class child to perish was Loraine Allison, aged 2. Proportionately, the heaviest losses were suffered by the second-class men, of whom 92% died. Additionally, among the pets brought aboard, three survived the sinking.|$|E
