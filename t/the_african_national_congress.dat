5|$|The National Assembly {{election}} was won by <b>the</b> <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> (ANC), {{but with a}} reduced majority of 62.1%, down from 65.9% in the 2009 election. The official opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) increased {{its share of the}} vote from 16.7% to 22.2%, while the newly formed Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) obtained 6.4% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Following growing {{pressure}} from the anti-apartheid movement both domestically and internationally, in 1990 State President Frederik Willem de Klerk reversed the ban on <b>the</b> <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> and other anti-apartheid organisations, and announced that Mandela would shortly be released from prison. Mandela was released in February 1990. He persuaded Makeba to return to South Africa, which she did, using her French passport, on 10 June 1990.|$|E
50|$|The {{order is}} named after the late Oliver Tambo, who was <b>the</b> <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress's</b> president-in-exile for many years.|$|R

5|$|Jack Abramoff {{wrote and}} co-produced the film Red Scorpion {{with his brother}} Robert in 1989. In the film, Dolph Lundgren plays Nikolai, a Soviet agent sent to assassinate an African revolutionary in a fictional country modeled on Angola. The South African {{government}} financed the film through the International Freedom Foundation, a front-group chaired by Abramoff, {{as part of its}} efforts to undermine international sympathy for <b>the</b> <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress.</b> While working in Hollywood, Abramoff was convicted for fraud and other offenses that he had committed during his concurrent career as a lobbyist.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{apartheid}}, when apartheid legislation {{had been}} repealed, Springbok colours started to be issued to non-whites again. In 1994, following the election of Nelson Mandela and <b>the</b> <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress,</b> the National Colours Board {{was set up to}} control the distribution of Springbok colours. Despite this, the majority of South Africa's sporting organisations stopped awarding Springbok colours following the replacement of the Springbok by the Protea following a government demand. The only sporting body in South Africa that was allowed to retain Springbok colours was the South African Rugby Union as an act of conciliation towards the white minority who made up the majority of the national rugby union team.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{eight years}} after their last {{official}} series, South Africa hosted New Zealand in a one-off test match. The resumption of international rugby in South Africa came after {{the dismantling of the}} apartheid system, and was only done with permission of <b>the</b> <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress.</b> With their return to test rugby, South Africa were selected to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup. After upsetting Australia in the opening match, South Africa continued to advance through the tournament until they met New Zealand in the final. After a tense final that went into extra time, South Africa emerged 15â€“12 winners, with then President Nelson Mandela, wearing a Springbok jersey, presenting the trophy to South Africa's captain, Francois Pienaar.|$|E
50|$|Indians {{also contributed}} to <b>the</b> <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress's</b> {{struggle}} against <b>the</b> Apartheid regime. The Indian government was {{an outspoken critic of}} <b>the</b> apartheid-era South <b>African</b> government, refusing to maintain diplomatic relations. India's support evoked goodwill in South Africa and other African countries.|$|R
50|$|On 2 June 1980, Sasolburg was {{attacked}} by Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), <b>the</b> <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress's</b> (ANC) military wing. They bombed two strategically important SASOL (oil-from-coal) plants and an oil refinery. This event was depicted in the 2006 film Catch a Fire.|$|R
5000|$|Penguin Books {{obtained}} {{the rights to}} publish the initial volume in the Commonwealth in 1986. In support of <b>the</b> <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress's</b> cultural boycott in opposition to apartheid, Spiegelman refused to [...] "compromise with fascism" [...] by allowing publication of his work in South Africa.|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, protest against South Africa's {{apartheid}} regime reached {{the stage of}} seeking to exclude the nation from international sport. In 1956, government rules requiring separate events for whites and non-whites in South Africa were issued; non-whites received poorer facilities. Brundage initially opposed taking any action. The run-up to the 1960 Rome Olympics had seen tumult in South Africa, including the Sharpeville massacre and a crackdown on <b>the</b> <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress.</b> Activists attempted to persuade Brundage that South Africa should be excluded from the Games. Brundage initially took the word of South African sport leaders that all citizens were able to compete for {{a place on the}} Olympic team, and that non-white South Africans simply were not good enough.|$|E
5|$|Nigeria's {{foreign policy}} was {{tested in the}} 1970s after the country emerged united from its own civil war. It {{supported}} movements against white minority governments in the Southern Africa sub-region. Nigeria backed <b>the</b> <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> (ANC) by taking a committed tough line {{with regard to the}} South African government and their military actions in southern Africa. Nigeria was also {{a founding member of the}} Organisation for African Unity (now the African Union), and has tremendous influence in West Africa and Africa on the whole. Nigeria has additionally founded regional cooperative efforts in West Africa, functioning as standard-bearer for the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and ECOMOG, economic and military organizations, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{governing}} African National Congress (ANC), {{supported by}} its Tripartite Alliance with the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and the South African Communist Party (SACP), have held {{a majority of}} the seats in the National Assembly since 1994. They were re-elected with increasing majorities in 1999 and 2004, and with a slight fall in its majority from 69% to 65.9% in 2009. The ANC is led by Jacob Zuma. In 2012, Zuma was re-elected to a second five-year term as President of <b>the</b> <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress,</b> beating his only rival and deputy, Kgalema Motlanthe, by a wide margin. Cyril Ramaphosa was elected as Deputy President of the ANC, succeeding Motlanthe who had declined a second term after losing to Zuma.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Zambian <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> was a {{political}} party in Zambia.|$|R
5000|$|Toyi-toyi {{was often}} used for intimidating <b>the</b> South <b>African</b> police and {{security}} forces during anti-apartheid demonstrations. The toyi-toyi was also used with chants such as <b>the</b> <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress's</b> [...] "Amandla" [...] ("power") and [...] "Awethu" [...] ("ours") or <b>the</b> Pan <b>African</b> Congress's [...] "One Settler, One Bullet".|$|R
50|$|Malema, a Mopedi, {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} Seshego, Transvaal Province. His mother was a {{domestic}} worker and a single parent. He joined <b>the</b> <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress's</b> Masupatsela at <b>the</b> age of nine or ten. His main task at the time, was to remove National Party posters.|$|R
5|$|At the {{university}} Goldstone {{became involved in}} the international effort to end South Africa's apartheid system. He had been brought up in an anti-apartheid atmosphere; although his parents were not activists, they were opposed to racial discrimination and this was to have a profound influence on his later career. Like many other South African Jews, he chose to become conspicuously active in public life in an effort to oppose or alleviate the worst aspects of apartheid. While he was chairman of {{the university}}'s Students' Representative Council, he campaigned against the exclusion of black students. He also attracted attention from the state security police by having contact with anti-apartheid groups within South Africa, including <b>the</b> <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress,</b> which was a banned organisation at the time. On one occasion he secretly tape-recorded a spy sent by the police to infiltrate the anti-apartheid student movement at the university. The recording was later used as evidence in the firing of the national police commissioner.|$|E
5|$|Freedom Square {{was located}} {{on the corner of}} Victoria and Morris Streets. It was famous in the 1950s for the {{political}} meetings held there. It was utilised by <b>the</b> <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> (ANC) and the Transvaal Congress Party. Many of the meetings were chaired by Trevor Huddleston. Freedom Square facilitated the cooperation between the aforementioned political parties. Here parties worked together against the apartheid regime. Freedom Square in Sophiatown {{should not be confused with}} Freedom Square in Kliptown, Soweto, where the Freedom Charter was adopted by the ANC in 1955. It was in this Freedom Square in Sophiatown that Nelson Mandela made his first public allusion to violence and armed resistance as a legitimate tool for change. This earned him a reprimand from Albert Luthuli who by then replaced Dr A.B. Xuma as president of the ANC. Current remnants of Freedom Square may be found beneath a school playing field alongside the Christ the King Church.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{many white}} Zimbabweans {{complained that they}} were {{suffering}} from racial discrimination. Many whites remained uneasy about living under the government of a black Marxist and they also feared that their children {{would be unable to}} secure jobs. There was a growing exodus to South Africa, and in 1980, 1700 whitesâ€”approximately a tenth of the white Zimbabwean populationâ€”emigrated. Mugabe's government had pledged support for <b>the</b> <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> and other anti-apartheid forces within South Africa, although did not allow them to use Zimbabwe as a base for their military operations. To protest apartheid and white minority rule in South Africa, Mugabe's government banned Zimbabwe from engaging South Africa in any sporting competitions. In turn, South Africa tried to destabilise Zimbabwe by blocking trade routes into the country and supporting anti-Mugabist militants among the country's white minority.|$|E

5|$|Notable former {{students}} of the college have included politicians, scientists, writers, entertainers and academics. T. E. Lawrence ("Lawrence of Arabia"), known {{for his part in}} the Arab Revolt of 1916â€“1918 and for his writings including Seven Pillars of Wisdom, studied history at the college. His thesis on Crusader castles (the fieldwork for which marked the beginning of his fascination with the Middle East) is held in the Fellows' Library. Other {{former students}} include Pixley ka Isaka Seme (a founder and president of <b>the</b> <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress),</b> Sir William Williams (Speaker of the House of Commons 1680â€“1685), and Lord Sankey (Lord Chancellor 1929â€“1935).

5|$|With Jongintaba's backing, in 1939 Mandela {{began work}} on a BA degree at the University of Fort Hare, an elite black {{institution}} in Alice, Eastern Cape, with around 150 students. There he studied English, anthropology, politics, native administration, and Roman Dutch law in his first year, desiring to become an interpreter or clerk in the Native Affairs Department. Mandela stayed in the Wesley House dormitory, befriending his own kinsman, K. D. Matanzima, as well as Oliver Tambo, who became a close friend and comrade for decades to come. He took up ballroom dancing, performed in a drama society play about Abraham Lincoln, and gave Bible classes in the local community {{as part of the}} Student Christian Association. Although he had friends connected to <b>the</b> <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> (ANC) who wanted South Africa to be independent of the British Empire, Mandela avoided any involvement with the anti-imperialist movement, and became a vocal supporter of the British war effort when the Second World War broke out. He helped to found a first-year students' house committee which challenged the dominance of the second-years, {{and at the end of}} his first year became involved in a Students' Representative Council (SRC) boycott against the quality of food, for which he was suspended from the university; he never returned to complete his degree.|$|E
