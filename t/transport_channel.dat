25|$|The {{broadcast}} or <b>transport</b> <b>channel</b> for TV {{in countries}} that use NTSC or ATSC has a bandwidth of 6MHz. To conserve bandwidth, SSB would be desirable, but the video signal has significant low-frequency content (average brightness) and has rectangular synchronising pulses. The engineering compromise is vestigial-sideband transmission. In vestigial sideband, the full upper sideband of bandwidth W2 = 4.75MHz is transmitted, but only W1 = 1.25MHz of the lower sideband is transmitted, along with a carrier. This effectively makes the system AM at low modulation frequencies and SSB at high modulation frequencies. The absence of the lower sideband components at high frequencies must be compensated for, and this {{is done by the}} RF and IF filters.|$|E

Next, we derive analytical expressions for bounds on the per-channel bit error probabilities seen when convolutional coding is employed by each channel and the multiplex is transmitted over an AWGN and a multipath channel, respectively. The derivation of these analytical expressions is the main contribution of this paper.
