25|$|Bottom-up approach: Once we {{formulate}} {{the solution}} to a problem recursively as in terms of its sub-problems, we can try reformulating the problem in a bottom-up fashion: try solving the sub-problems first and use their solutions to build-on and arrive at solutions <b>to</b> <b>bigger</b> sub-problems. This is also usually done in a tabular form by iteratively generating solutions <b>to</b> <b>bigger</b> and bigger sub-problems by using the solutions to small sub-problems. For example, if we already know the values of F41 and F40, we can directly calculate the value of F42.|$|R

5|$|Farmer {{moved from}} trumpet to playing mostly flugelhorn {{from the early}} 1960s, utilising the latter instrument's more mellow sound and Farmer's ability {{to get what he}} wanted from it without having to use a mute. In 1989, he played a major part in {{creating}} a trumpet–flugelhorn hybrid, the flumpet, which was constructed for him by instrument maker David Monette. This instrument allowed him to play with more expression in a range of settings, from small groups <b>to</b> <b>big</b> bands. In 1997, Monette presented him with a personalized flumpet, with decorations symbolising important people and places in Farmer's life.|$|E
5|$|Farther north, NY10 passes {{directly}} {{between the}} Stoner Lakes, {{a pair of}} small water bodies separated by only NY10, just south of where it crosses into Hamilton County. For most of its run through the county, NY10 parallels a waterbody, namely the west branch of the Sacandaga River to where the Piseco Outlet flows into it, then the Piseco Outlet north <b>to</b> <b>Big</b> Bay near the community of Higgins Bay. NY10 terminates soon after at an intersection with NY8 south of Piseco Lake, west of Spy Lake, and southwest of Higgins Bay.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, M-35 from Negaunee <b>to</b> <b>Big</b> Bay to L'Anse {{was officially}} {{canceled}} {{as a state}} trunkline highway. Constructed portions were turned over to local control, becoming Skanee Road in Baraga County and CR510 in Marquette County. This left a discontinuous routing for 13years. The southern segment of M-35 ran from Menominee to Negaunee, and the northern segment ran from Baraga to Ontonagon along the modern M-38. The two segments were rejoined in 1953, closing the gap left by the cancelled Huron Mountain route. M-35 signs were added to existing highway signs westward {{from the end of}} the southern segment at Negaunee along US41/M-28 and US41 to Baraga, to connect with the northern segment westward to Ontonagon.|$|E

5|$|Integrated {{education}} {{models are}} {{emerging in the}} academic world, a model which {{is referred to as}} T-shape and π-shaped education. T-shaped professionals are taught general knowledge in a few disciplines (e.g. management and engineering) and specific, deep knowledge in a single domain (e.g. design). This model also applies to companies, when they shift their focus from small T innovations (innovations involving only one discipline, like chemists) <b>to</b> <b>big</b> T innovations (innovations involving several disciplines, like design, ethnography, lead user, etc.). Like in education, this shift makes breaking down silos of departments and disciplines of knowledge essential.|$|E
5|$|Local {{industries}} in Nashik, especially those {{located in the}} Ambad Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation area, were affected due to the large-scale departure of migrant workers.

Though the local industries at Nashik are ancillary units, they provide material <b>to</b> <b>big</b> industries such as Mahindra and Mahindra and Crompton Greaves. Losses resulting from the exodus were estimated to be Rs.500– 7billion.|$|E

5|$|The Caton–Corning {{segment of}} the route was {{acquired}} {{by the state of}} New York in 1911 and designated as part of NY44 (now NY414) as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It received its current designation in 1949 when NY414 was truncated to begin in Corning. The highway leading east from Caton <b>to</b> <b>Big</b> Flats was county-maintained from the 1930s through the 1970s, even though it had been part of NY13 from the 1930 renumbering to the 1940s. The state of New York assumed maintenance of the highway by 1986, and the new state highway became an extension of NY225.|$|E
5|$|The {{notion of}} kingship in Europe {{ultimately}} originates in systems of tribal kingship in prehistoric Europe. The Minoan (c. 3200 – c. 1400 BCE) and Mycenaean civilisation (c. 1600 – c. 1100 BCE) provide the earliest examples of monarchies in protohistoric Greece. Thanks to the decipherment of the Linear B script in 1952, much knowledge has been acquired about {{society in the}} Mycenaean realms, where the kings functioned as leaders of palace economies. The role of kings changed in the following Greek Dark Ages (c. 1100 – c. 750 BCE) <b>to</b> <b>big</b> gentleman farmers with military power.|$|E
