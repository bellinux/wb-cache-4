The drawing depth strongly depends on the test temperature. If the test temperature decreased under 200 oC, the crack occurred at the crown.

With its nature of pseudo-identity and almost zero cost of creating multiple identities, online auction markets face a daunting task in detecting <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Traditional demographic-data-based detections that focus on verifying the authenticity of information as seen in credit card transactions are less likely an option for detecting similar frauds in online environments. Coping with this difficulty, we propose an alternative perspective to detect inflated reputation behaviors by uncovering evidences of the extra resource exerted for making such premeditated manipulation. The cumulated transaction data of confirmed reputation-inflated accounts in eBay are collected to portray their corresponding transaction social networks and to calculate the related network indices. By applying social network analysis (SNA), we identify two transactional network structure measurements, k-core and core/ periphery ratio, for distinguishing the OLAIR traders from regular accounts. The power of these two indicators is validated by two approaches: statistical significance testing and incrementa...|$|R
