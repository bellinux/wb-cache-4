Joseph Banks, an English botanist, wanted <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>the</b> collection, but his son Carl refused and moved the collection to Uppsala. In 1783 Carl died and Sara inherited the collection, having outlived both her husband and son.

The acquaintance was a 24-year-old medical student, James Edward Smith, who bought the whole collection: 14,000 plants, 3,198 insects, 1,564 shells, about 3,000 letters and 1,600 books.

5|$|However, his {{re-instatement}} {{was short}} lived, as the navigation ceased {{to operate in}} January 1869, the last month in which tolls were collected. Mortgages of £19,708 were outstanding, of which £2,607 dated from the original construction by Pyott. A plan <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>the</b> waterway by J. R. Stebbings of Southampton in 1871 fell through. A further attempt <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>the</b> navigation was made in 1909 by Patrick O'Carroll, an estate agent from Southsea. He created a company called the Itchen Navigation Ltd, with a capital of £20,000, but {{they were unable to}} establish who owned it, and so the company never traded.|$|E
