Soon after this apparent improvement, the horse will display signs of shock, including an elevated heart rate, increased capillary refill time, rapid shallow breathing, and a change in mucous membrane color. It may also be pyretic, act depressed, or become extremely painful.|$|E

25|$|Australia {{made one}} {{change to the}} side that won in Adelaide as Andrew Symonds came into the team {{following}} the shock retirement of Damien Martyn. England dropped Ashley Giles and James Anderson, replacing them with Monty Panesar and Sajid Mahmood respectively. Ricky Ponting won the toss and elected to bat. Monty Panesar justified his selection taking 5 wickets, the best figures by an English spinner in Perth. Steve Harmison took 4 wickets, relieving <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>that</b> had been growing on him after taking 1 for 288 {{in the first two}} tests. Harmison and Panesar combined to bowl Australia out for 244. Michael Hussey finished 74 not out, the only player of six top-eight batsmen to convert a 20-plus score into a long stay at the crease. England lost 2 for 51 after an aggressive start by openers Alistair Cook and Andrew Strauss. Strauss and Paul Collingwood were the overnight batsmen, the latter having been reprieved by a dropped catch from the bowling of Stuart Clark.|$|E

It identifies the sources of student's <b>pressure</b> and discusses <b>the</b> cultural, social, and economic conditions that influence a fiercely competitive educational system. The focus of this study is the impact of academic pressures on Japanese students. Japanese education is a single-minded drive for achievement that results in what many refer to as examination hell. The university entrance examination {{is at the root of}} <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>that</b> are placed on students and is the primary mechanism responsible for driving competition. The life-long ramifications of students performance on this examination are far reaching. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>that</b> are exerted upon students to achieve are overwhelming. Mothers, teachers, peers, and society contribute to <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>that</b> are placed on students to achieve, while many children continue to fall victim to emotional, psychological, and physical harm. The study provides richly descriptive narrative accounts of student's experiences, thoughts and feelings seen from a student's perspective.

Critics, including Glamour magazine's Hayley Spencer, The Huffington Post Jenavieve Hatch, and Rachael Moon of the Daily Mirror, praised it. According to Cosmopolitan magazine's Nikki Kinstlinger and Georgia Simmonds of Marie Claire, Ratajkowski finds self-empowerment in defining and owning the expression of her sexuality and body. Salon Erin Coulehan described the essay's identification of a societal catch-22, in which showcasing female sexuality that may [...] "offend, excite, or create envy" [...] leads to criticism and body shaming. InStyle Isabella Silvers concurred that [...] "female sexuality isn't always {{for the benefit of}} someone else".

The band intended to release [...] "Endless" [...] as the album's second single, however as they were not fully satisfied with the song, released [...] "Rookie" [...] in its place in March 2011. Just prior to the single's physical release, Japan experienced the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011, which made Yamaguchi re-evaluate the reasons why the band made music. Originally, the album's documentary concept focused on themselves as a band, but the disaster prompted Yamaguchi to take inspiration from world events such as the earthquake. [...] "Bach no Senritsu o Yoru ni Kiita Sei Desu", released as the album's third single in July, was written as therapy for Yamaguchi during this time.|$|E
500|$|Australia's {{opportunity}} came at Headingley, a Test {{described by}} Bradman {{as the best}} he ever played in. England batted first and made 223. During the Australian innings, Bradman backed himself by opting to bat on in poor light conditions, reasoning that Australia could score more runs in bad light on a good wicket than on a rain affected wicket in good light, {{when he had the}} option to go off. He scored 103 {{out of a total of}} 242 and the gamble paid off, as it meant there was sufficient time to push for victory when an England collapse left them a target of only 107 to win. Australia slumped to 4/61, with Bradman out for 16. An approaching storm threatened to wash the game out, but the poor weather held off and Australia managed to secure the win, a victory that retained the Ashes. For the only time in his life, the tension of the occasion got to Bradman and he could not watch the closing stages of play, a reflection of <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>that</b> he felt all tour: he described the captaincy as [...] "exhausting" [...] and said he [...] "found it difficult to keep going".|$|E
500|$|Rivera's {{signature}} pitch was a cut fastball or [...] "cutter", which exhibited {{lateral movement}} towards left-handed hitters {{similar to that}} of a slider but with the velocity of a fastball. The sharp, late movement of Rivera's cutter prevented hitters from making contact with the ball on the sweet spot of their bats, leading to them not only making weak contact on batted balls but also frequently breaking their bats; according to a tally by columnist Buster Olney, Rivera broke 44bats during the 2001 regular season. Chipper Jones, who once witnessed teammate Ryan Klesko break three bats in one plate appearance against Rivera in the 1999 World Series, called the pitch a [...] "buzz saw". Rivera's long fingers and loose wrist contributed to the pitch's movement, allowing him to impart more spin on the ball. Describing his grip of the cutter, he said, [...] "it's really a four-seam fastball with pressure on the middle finger". By adjusting <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>that</b> he applied to the ball with his fingertips, he could vary the pitch's movement. Rivera threw four-seam and two-seam fastballs as complementary pitches but primarily used his cutter; according to baseball statistics website Fangraphs, 83.3% of his pitches in 2010 were cutters. All three pitches typically reached a velocity in the low-to-mid 90smph.|$|E
