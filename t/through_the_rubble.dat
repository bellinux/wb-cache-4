40|$|Oil {{exploration}} from artificial Islands in the Beaufort Sea {{has shown}} that grounded ice rubble fields often accumulate around such structures, preventing moving ice from acting directly against the structure. A simple, rigid body model, has commonly been used to estimate the load "seen" by the structure, {{with the result that}} no loading is expected until global rubble sliding occurs. It was realized that such an approach is not entirely realistic and so a collaborative field program was carried out, followed by theoretical modelling. The field work was done at a drilling location in the southern Beaufort Sea on ESSO's Caisson Retained Island (CRI). The three groups involved were ESSO Resources Canada Ltd., National Research Council of Canada (NRC) and Memorial University of Newfoundland (M. U. N.). The M. U. N. data and subsequent theoretical work is presented here, with the ESSO and NRC data summarized in the site description. [...] Memorial University collected data from pressure sensor rosettes, a strain array, thermocouple arrays, rubble profiling, and ice property measurements. The most important data came from the pressure sensor rosettes and the thermocouple arrays. These indicated that average sea ice pressures against <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> reached 350 kPa, and that a substantial and rapidly formed refrozen layer existed within <b>the</b> <b>rubble,</b> with a thickness exceeding 3 m near <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> field periphery. [...] Based on the field measurements, a theoretical model was developed to investigate the role of <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> refrozen layer in load transmission <b>through</b> <b>rubble.</b> <b>The</b> <b>rubble</b> field was modelled as a system of springs and dampers to represent the elastic, frictional, and viscous stiffness of the various load paths. The deformations and load distributions were calculated using a commercial finite element package called ABAQUS. Each material property was assumed to have a range of values, the limits of which were determined from the literature, theoretical considerations and field measurements. [...] The sensitivity of the output to each of the inputs was examined and the following was concluded; [...] 1. From the analysis it appears that the elastic response of <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> leads to <b>the</b> highest loads on the embedded structure because the transmitted load tends to decrease with time (creep). [...] 2. <b>The</b> ice <b>rubble</b> properties that are the most important for further study are the delayed elastic and shear properties of un-refrozen rubble, as well as their variability within natural rubble fields. [...] 3. Significant loads may be transmitted through ice rubble to a structure before global sliding of <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> field occurs. [...] 4. The presence of the refrozen layer gives the potential for substantial loads to be imposed on <b>the</b> structure during <b>rubble</b> field movement. [...] 5. Possible future improvements to the ABAQUS computer model include the incorporation of; refrozen layer discontinuities, berm slope, non-rigid structure behaviour, kinetic and static friction values (rather than an average), and water and ice mass. Furthur research is also required on ice/rubble failure modes to esablish design pressures at <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> field boundaries. [...] 6. The sample 3 D calculations show that viscous deformation may also be important, although {{it is also clear that}} the 3 D method presented needs improvement.

50|$|The most {{significant}} {{structure of the}} central part of the town is the Forum. It is a rectangular area oriented north-south, its size is 38x25 meters bounded on the east and west side with a row of seven pillars. To the east and west of the forum two rectangular spaces are built, almost identical in size and construction method. These buildings have two entrances. In the northern part of the Forum, around the middle, between the side rooms, on a raised platform of 1.10 meters, is an important temple dedicated to Antinous, the early deceased lover of the Emperor Hadrian. After the death of Hadrian traces that resemble Antinous were erased, and only by sifting <b>through</b> <b>the</b> construction <b>rubble</b> was found a plaque with an inscription dedicated to Hadrian, which shows that the temple in the Forum was built in the period between 136 and 138 AD.|$|R
25|$|The {{narrow streets}} of the town made {{effective}} maneuver difficult. Bazooka rounds fired from rooftops and artillery air bursts caused by proximity fuses created a lethal rain of splinters. The Sherman tanks, hiding in alleyways and behind buildings, quickly knocked out six Panzers. Eight more SS Panzers were also hit and destroyed by 57mm anti-tank guns, anti-tank rockets, bazookas, and mines, leaving them unable to swiftly plow <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> and gain the open country of the ridge line. Neither side was inclined to take prisoners, and the losses on both sides were catastrophic. During the German attack, Sgt. Jose M. Lopez, single-handedly manned a heavy machine gun. Falling back several times, he ignored enemy tank fire and falling artillery rounds, and killed more than 100 enemy infantry attempting to flank his unit, allowing them to successfully withdraw.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who were}} rescued first {{were taken to}} another {{building}} for treatment, as the ambulances were trapped inside the collapsed tower. The hospital {{did not have an}} emergency plan but nonetheless, surviving hospital workers and neighbors quickly improvised, under the management of the hospital, setting up aid stations and scavenging supplies. Rescue workers soon arrived to start digging <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>rubble.</b> A second quake made rescue work slower, because of fear of further collapse. Most bodies were identified by personal effects, some by dental records and some were so mangled that they wound up being cremated without ever being identified, {{due to the lack of}} morgue facilities. 561 bodies were found and 188 were never identified. 266 were hospital workers and 44 were medical residents. The majority who were rescued were found in the first five days. The number of bodies recovered was high during those first days as well but the numbers dramatically increased between days 17 and 31.|$|E
25|$|William of Tyre, {{chronicler of}} the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, {{reports on the}} {{renovation}} of the Church in the mid-12th century. The crusaders investigated the eastern ruins on the site, occasionally excavating <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>rubble,</b> and while attempting to reach the cistern, they discovered {{part of the original}} ground level of Hadrian's temple enclosure; they decided to transform this space into a chapel dedicated to Helena (the Chapel of Saint Helena), widening their original excavation tunnel into a proper staircase. The crusaders began to refurnish the church in a Romanesque style and added a bell tower. These renovations unified the small chapels on the site and were completed during the reign of Queen Melisende in 1149, placing all the Holy places under one roof for the first time. The church became the seat of the first Latin Patriarchs, and was also the site of the kingdom's scriptorium. The church was lost to Saladin, {{along with the rest of}} the city, in 1187, although the treaty established after the Third Crusade allowed for Christian pilgrims to visit the site. Emperor Frederick II (r. 1220–50) regained the city and the church by treaty in the 13th century while he himself was under a ban of excommunication, with the curious consequence that the holiest church in Christianity was laid under interdict. The church seems to have been largely in Greek Orthodox Patriarch Athanasius II of Jerusalem's hands, ca. 1231–47, during the Latin control of Jerusalem. Both city and church were captured by the Khwarezmians in 1244.|$|E
40|$|The Tarsiut Caisson Retained Island (CRI) was {{the first}} caisson island used for {{exploratory}} drilling in the Canadian Beaufort Sea. During the winter of 1982 / 83, it {{was used as a}} test platform to measure ice loads on Beaufort Sea structures, as part of the Tarsiut Ice Research Program (TIRP). The Tarsiut CRI was a hybrid sand and concrete caisson structure that was approximately 100 m wide. It was deployed on a large sand berm in a relatively shallow water depth of 20 m. During the TIRP program, a large grounded rubble field formed around the CRI. A number of different parameters were measured throughout the winter as part of TIRP, including the ice loads, ice conditions, and general movement of the ice. In the spring, a number of strain-measuring devices were used to measure the strains in the ice sheet surrounding <b>the</b> grounded <b>rubble</b> field. From this information, loads could be determined both on the outer edge of <b>the</b> grounded <b>rubble</b> field and at the caisson structure itself. There were a few significant ice-loading events during this particular deployment. In all cases, the ice load directly measured on the caisson was substantially lower than the load on the outer edge of <b>the</b> grounded <b>rubble</b> field surrounding it. This paper presents a brief overview of the test program and the measuring systems at Tarsiut. Three significant ice-loading events are described in detail and the attenuation of <b>the</b> ice load <b>through</b> <b>the</b> grounded ice <b>rubble</b> is described. It is seen that <b>the</b> grounded ice <b>rubble</b> acted as a protective barrier. The average global load was attenuated by more than 60 % due to the presence of <b>the</b> <b>rubble.</b> <b>The</b> peak global load was attenuated by 85 %.

500|$|The storm {{arrived in}} Pennsylvania as an extratropical cyclone late on September 29, still {{accompanied}} by strong winds that disconnected wires and interrupted communications throughout the state.

500|$|With Achtung Baby, {{the group}} sought to recover {{some of the}} Dadaist {{characters}} and stage antics they had dabbled with in the late 1970s as teenagers. U2 had abandoned these ideas for more literal themes in the 1980s. However, for the new album, the band was interested in no longer making obvious sense. Accordingly, the lyrics for [...] "Zoo Station" [...] were inspired by the surrealism of a story about Berlin during World War II that Bono heard. Animals escaped the city's zoo after it was damaged in overnight bombing, and as a result, rhinoceroses, pelicans and flamingoes wandered around the next morning while people were sifting <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>rubble.</b> Bono was also inspired by Berlin Zoologischer Garten railway station, also known as [...] "Zoo station", previously the main railway station in West Berlin. The station was notorious as a haunt for drug dealers, prostitutes and pimps, pick-pockets and transients, particularly prior to German reunification, when it was run by the East German railway.

500|$|Work {{was also}} {{on-going}} {{to upgrade the}} road east of Lethbridge. [...] In 1927, the Red Trail between Coaldale and Chin was gravelled, and the upgrading continued further east to Taber in 1928. [...] In 1929, delegates from various communities along the route met in Taber to advocate to the provincial government for gravelling of the Red Trail from Taber to Medicine Hat. [...] The Taber to Bow Island section was completed between 1929 and 1931, and a similar meeting was held in Lethbridge in 1931 lobbying for the remainder. [...] The group included local officials, farmers and residents who argued that the Red Trail connected key population centres and irrigation districts in southern Alberta, and was a component of an interprovincial route from Vancouver to Winnipeg. [...] The route was better known by tourists, they claimed, and was the only highway to the west that could economically be kept open year-round. [...] At this time, British Columbia had done work to their portion of the highway allowing it to remain open year-round so it was desirable for Alberta to follow suit. [...] The general sentiment among southern Alberta officials was that the Red Trail was a shorter and more preferable route compared to the northern branch of the Trans-Canada through Calgary. [...] Minister of Public Works Oran McPherson in 1934 announced that the section between Bow Island and Medicine Hat would be gravelled, permitting all-weather travel for {{the entire length of}} Highway3. [...] Along with similar work in southern Saskatchewan and the aforementioned British Columbia work, the project created an all-weather connection across the southern prairies. [...] <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> of the Frank Slide, a new route for the highway was carved north of the railway in 1932, and paving of Highway3 began in August1939.

The road was full of potholes, flints and lumps of concrete; water was escaping everywhere from the mains, as well as gas, so people were warned not to smoke. A house had received a direct hit; neighbours thought both husband and wife were at work, but someone then said they thought she had gone indoors and was wearing a purple coat.
