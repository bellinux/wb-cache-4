5|$|Despite the {{damaging}} {{air attacks}} to their ships and landing forces, the Japanese proceeded {{with the construction}} of the naval seaplane base at Tulagi and Gavutu, receiving more shipments of troops and construction workers over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> <b>months.</b> The base was soon operational with aircraft from the Yokohama Air Group which conducted air reconnaissance patrols throughout the surrounding area beginning on 6 May. On 27 May, the Japanese inspected the Lunga Point area on Guadalcanal as a possible location to build a large airfield. On 13 June, the Naval General Staff approved the construction of an airfield at that location and on 19 June, Admiral Inoue toured the site in anticipation of the airfield construction effort. The next day, Japanese troops began clearing the area of brush, and on 6 July, a 12-ship convoy delivered 2,000 Korean and Japanese construction workers plus 500 Japanese naval combat troops to conduct the airfield construction effort in earnest. The coastwatchers on Guadalcanal and Allied air reconnaissance observed the Japanese airfield construction efforts. Allied Catalinas and B-17s based at Port Moresby, Efate, Noumea, and Espiritu Santo frequently bombed the Japanese bases on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Gavutu over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> <b>months,</b> but without causing significant damage.

25|$|The Exarchate at {{this time}} was in {{internal}} turmoil due to {{the conflict between the}} mainly Orthodox Chalcedonian population and the supporters of Monotheletism, an attempt at compromise between Chalcedonianism and Monophysitism devised and promoted by Heraclius in 638. In Africa, the latter was mostly advocated by refugees from Egypt. In an effort to lessen the tensions, in July 645 Gregory hosted a theological dispute in his capital Carthage between the Chalcedonian Maximus the Confessor and the Monothelite former Patriarch of Constantinople, Pyrrhus. Gregory helped to bring about a reconciliation between the two, and Pyrrhus re-embraced the Chalcedonian position.

40|$|Organisms {{selecting}} retreat sites may evaluate {{not only}} {{the quality of the}} specific shelter, but also the proximity of that site to resources in the surrounding area. Distinguishing between habitat selection at these two spatial scales is complicated by co-variation among microhabitat factors (i. e., the attributes of individual retreat sites often correlate with their proximity to landscape features). Disentangling this co-variation may facilitate the restoration or conservation of threatened systems. To experimentally examine the role of landscape attributes in determining retreat-site quality for saxicolous ectotherms, we deployed 198 identical artificial rocks in open (sun-exposed) sites on sandstone outcrops in southeastern Australia, and recorded faunal usage of those retreat sites over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 29 <b>months.</b> <b>Several</b> landscape-scale attributes were associated with occupancy of experimental rocks, but different features were important for different species. For example, endangered broad-headed snakes (Hoplocephalus bungaroides) preferred retreat sites close to cliff edges, flat rock spiders (Hemicloea major) preferred small outcrops, and velvet geckos (Oedura lesueurii) preferred rocks close to the cliff edge with higher-than-average sun exposure.

50|$|In 1957, when Stallworth was sixteen, James Brown and the Famous Flames was {{breaking}} up; Bobby Byrd (founder), Sylvester Keels, NaFloyd Scott, Nash Knox, and Johnny Terry had left because the group's managers, Clint Brantley and Ben Bart, gave James Brown top billing. Over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> few <b>months,</b> <b>several</b> members {{came and went}} including Willie Johnson, Big Bill Hollings, J. W. Archer and Louis Madison. These men, after departing the group, went on to form a San Francisco-based splinter group, The Fabulous Flames. Members of this interim Famous Flames singing group claimed they had left because Brown refused to pay them. Brown said {{they were asked to}} leave because of alcohol and drug use while touring. By this time, with the departure of original group leader/founder Bobby Byrd, Brown had taken full control of The Famous Flames. In 1958, Stallworth was recruited as a replacement group member. He was nicknamed Baby Lloyd because he was the youngest member of the group. Bobby Bennett, along with original members Bobby Byrd and Johnny Terry also rejoined, and with James Brown, became the permanent Famous Flames lineup.|$|R

The funnels were modified with raked caps and searchlight platforms on their sides. The ship's 8.8cm guns were replaced with more powerful 10.5cm guns. Work lasted until November 1939, shortly after the outbreak of World War II. She spent <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> <b>months</b> on trials and training maneuvers. On 4 January, Karlsruhe and the minelayer Schiff 23 were sent to intercept the Swedish steamer Konung Oscar, which was transporting Polish refugees from Riga to Sweden. Karlsruhe caught the Swedish vessel, declared it a prize, and sent it and the 41 Poles aboard to Memel.

Stroke has led the way among journals in the vascular/neuroscience disciplines in striv-ing to improve the quality and reproducibility of preclinical research, as detailed in the recent special report by Howells and Macleod. 1 Several new features have been added to the journal during the past 3 years, including, most recently, a monthly synopsis of important preclinical and clinical papers related to cerebrovascular disorders that have appeared in other journals. Over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> few <b>months,</b> <b>several</b> other new and innovative features will appear, primarily in the elec-tronic version of Stroke. These new ventures will attempt to expand the use of Stroke to our readers and provide additional venues to improve the education of more junior members of the cerebrovascular community. The time to making an ini-tial editorial decision of articles submitted to Stroke has been substantially reduced, as has the time to both electronic and print publication of accepted articles. All these improvements are testaments to the dedication and hard work of the highly dedicated group of associate editors and our vice-editor Karen Furie, as well as the editorial board, section editors, consulting editors, and assistant editors. I thank all of them for their dili-gence and timely evaluation of submitted articles. Stroke func-tions efficiently because of the dedication of our managing editor, Rebecca Seastrong, and our editorial assistant, Amy Invernizzi. I greatly appreciate their help, and without them, producing a high-quality, influential journal for the cerebro-vascular disorders community would not be possible.
