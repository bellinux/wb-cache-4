5|$|<b>The</b> <b>iPhone</b> 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are {{smartphones}} {{designed and}} marketed by Apple Inc. The devices {{are part of}} <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> series and were announced on September 9, 2014, and released on September 19, 2014. <b>The</b> <b>iPhone</b> 6 and iPhone 6 Plus jointly serve as successors to <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5S and were themselves replaced as flagship devices of <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> series by <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 6S and iPhone 6S Plus on September 9, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Apple {{announced}} <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5C and <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5S {{during a}} media event at its Cupertino headquarters on September 10, 2013. While <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5C became available for preorder on September 13, 2013, <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5S {{was not available}} for preorder. Both devices were released on September 20, 2013. While most of the promotion focused on Touch ID, the 64-bit Apple A7 processor was also a highlight during the event.|$|E
5|$|Hardware {{benchmarking}} {{conducted using}} Geekbench and GLBenchmark validates several claims that Apple included on their website and {{mentioned at the}} unveiling of the device, these include two times faster and two times the graphics performance. In the Geekbench overall hardware assessment, <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5 received a score that was approximately 2.5 times higher than <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 4S. The benchmark conducted using GLBenchmark for <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5 returned a score that was 2 times better than <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 4S. The result was however inconsistent as a 3D graphics benchmark assessment using Passmark returned a score that was only approximately 1.45 times better than <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 4S. Battery life assessments conducted by AnandTech concluded that the battery life is shorter on <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5 than its predecessor when performing certain tasks, however when performing other tasks <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5 battery outlasts <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 4S.|$|E

5|$|Like <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 4S, <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5 has Siri, {{that allows}} the user to operate <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> by spoken commands. The {{software}} was improved in iOS 6 to include {{the ability to make}} restaurant reservations, launch apps, dictate Facebook or Twitter updates, retrieve movie reviews and detailed sports statistics.|$|E
5|$|Most reviewers {{recommended}} <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5S over <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5C {{which was}} released {{at the same}} time. The 5C retained almost the same hardware as the discontinued iPhone 5, while <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5S featured substantially improved performance/features thanks to its new 64-bit A7 processor, as well as extra storage space, all for a relatively small additional upfront cost over <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5C (US$650 versus US$550 in March 2014). This was especially the case when iOS 8 was released and both iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C were moved to the mid and low end of <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> range, respectively; <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5S still had 16 or 32 GB storage available while <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5C had {{to make do with}} 8 GB storage with only 4.9GB available to the user after installing iOS 8. Furthermore, the 5C's polycarbonate exterior received a mixed reception and was seen as a cost-cutting downgrade compared to <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5's aluminum/glass case; the 5S retained the latter design and looked even more premium due its additional gold finish.|$|E
5|$|On September 9, 2015, {{with the}} release of <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 6S and iPhone 6S Plus, <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 6 and 6 Plus were moved to the {{mid-range}} of <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> lineup. The 128GB versions of <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 6 and iPhone 6 Plus was discontinued along with the gold version of both phones, but the 16GB and 64GB versions of <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in silver and space gray remain available for sale at a reduced price.|$|E

5|$|Six {{months after}} the release of <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5S, on March 25, 2014, Apple {{announced}} that sales of <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> brand had exceeded 500 million units. By May 2014, despite having been on the market for eight months, <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5S reportedly outsold the newly released Samsung Galaxy S5 by 40%, with 7 million iPhone 5S units versus 5 million Galaxy S5 units. The Galaxy S5's failure to oust <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5S from the top selling spot was a major setback for Samsung Mobile, as the preceding Samsung Galaxy SIII and Samsung Galaxy S4, {{in the first quarter of}} their releases, had outsold <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 4S and iPhone 5 respectively.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5 is a {{smartphone}} {{designed and}} marketed by Apple Inc. It is the sixth generation of <b>the</b> <b>iPhone,</b> succeeding <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 4S and preceding <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5S and iPhone 5C. Formally unveiled {{as part of}} a press event on September 12, 2012, it was released on September 21, 2012. <b>The</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5 is the first iPhone to be announced in September and setting a trend for subsequent iPhone releases, the first iPhone be completely developed under the guidance of Tim Cook and the last iPhone to be overseen by Steve Jobs.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5 {{was officially}} {{discontinued}} by Apple on September 10, 2013 with {{the announcement of}} its successors, <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5S and <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5C. <b>The</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5 has the shortest lifespan of any iPhone ever produced with only twelve months in production, breaking with Apple's standard practice of selling an existing iPhone model at a reduced price upon {{the release of a}} new model, being replaced as a midrange and then an entry-level device by <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5C; the 5C internal hardware specifications are almost identical to the 5 albeit having a less expensive polycarbonate exterior. <b>The</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5 supports 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, but not iOS 11 which was released on September 19, 2017. <b>The</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5 is the second iPhone to support five major versions of iOS after <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 4S.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{original}} <b>iPhone</b> {{was described}} as [...] "revolutionary" [...] and a [...] "game-changer" [...] for the mobile phone industry. Newer iterations have also garnered praise, and <b>the</b> <b>iPhone's</b> success has been credited with helping to make Apple one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5 {{was officially}} {{discontinued}} by Apple on September 10, 2013 with {{the announcement of}} its successors, <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5S and <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5C. While the 5C shared almost the same internal hardware as <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5, the 5C used a lower-cost poly-carbonate plastic case {{in place of the}} original 5's aluminum form. The introduction of the 5C deviated from Apple's previous market strategy, where the previous iPhone model would remain in production, but sold at a lower price point below the new model.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5S was succeeded as Apple's {{flagship}} smartphone by {{the larger}} iPhone 6 in September 2014. On March 21, 2016, the 5S received a direct replacement with the announcement of <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> SE, which incorporated internal hardware similar to <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 6S while retaining the smaller form factor and design of the 5S.|$|E
5|$|Docks {{for both}} <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5S and 5C {{were found on}} the Apple online store after the announcement. Because of the casing {{difference}} between <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5S and 5C, they have separate docks, each made specifically for each respective phone.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>iPhone's</b> {{indicators}} are more exposed {{than those in}} some mobile phones from other manufacturers, which carry them in a more protected location, such as beneath the battery behind a battery cover. <b>The</b> <b>iPhone's</b> can be triggered during routine use, by an owner's sweat, steam in a bathroom, and other light environmental moisture. Criticism led Apple to change its water damage policy for iPhones and similar products, allowing customers to request further internal inspection of the phone to verify if internal liquid damage sensors were triggered.|$|R

5|$|During the keynote, Apple {{announced}} {{a case for}} <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5 that is made of soft microfiber {{on the inside and}} leather on the outside. This case was {{announced a}}long with iPhone 5C's case, both of which are the first cases Apple has announced since <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 4 Bumpers.|$|E
5|$|On September 10, 2013, <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 4S {{name was}} re-stylised as iPhone 4s, using a lower case 's' {{to reflect the}} names of the newly {{announced}} iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c. This was unusual for Apple as an upper case 'S' had been used since the introduction of <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 3GS in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Reception {{towards the}} device was {{generally}} positive, with some outlets considering {{it to be the}} best smartphone available on the market due to its upgraded hardware, Touch ID, and other changes introduced by iOS 7. Some criticized <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5S for keeping the design and small display of <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5, and others expressed security concerns about the Touch ID system. Nine million units of <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5S and iPhone 5C were sold on their weekend of release, breaking Apple's sales record for iPhones. <b>The</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5S was the best selling phone on all major U.S. carriers in September 2013.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>iPhone</b> 5S is {{the third}} iPhone to support five major {{versions}} of iOS after <b>the</b> <b>iPhone</b> 4S and iPhone 5. The 5S supports 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, being the oldest iPhone to support iOS 11 since it was the earliest to have incorporated a 64-bit SoC processor.|$|E
