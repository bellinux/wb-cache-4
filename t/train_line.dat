5|$|The GO system {{map shows}} seven train lines (or corridors), all departing from Toronto's Union Station and mostly named {{respectively}} after the outer terminus of train service. Although colours are assigned in a consistent fashion to each line in all official media, in colloquial parlance lines are only ever {{referred to by}} their names. Buses are numbered in blocks of 10, corresponding to the nearest <b>train</b> <b>line,</b> with the 40s and 50s reserved for express services along the 407 ETR corridor which {{does not have a}} corresponding <b>train</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5|$|A future extension, {{scheduled}} to begin construction in April 2018, will carry Donald Cousens Parkway north, crossing over the Stouffville GO <b>Train</b> <b>line</b> on a new bridge and merging into the current southern terminus of Highway48. As a result of this, Highway48 and Donald Cousens Parkway (York Regional Road48) will become the through route while Main Street will meet them at an intersection demarcating the two.|$|E

5|$|Before {{reaching}} movie audiences, hip-hop {{dance was}} already being broadcast on television. Soul Train was a , music variety show that featured social dancing and performances by African-American soul, funk, and R singers. The show was broadcast in South Korea via the US Armed Forces Korea Network. Before officially becoming a crew, The Lockers made several appearances on this show. After becoming a crew, The Electric Boogaloos also {{appeared on the}} show. Soul Train premiered in 1970. During its 36 year run, the resident freestyle dancers were {{referred to as the}} Soul Train Gang. Auditions were held in 1971 when the show moved from Chicago, Illinois to Los Angeles, California. Dancers who wanted to get on Soul Train after this time had to rely on word-of-mouth recommendations from dancers who were already employed by the show. A regular feature during the broadcast was the Soul <b>Train</b> <b>Line.</b> To participate in the Soul <b>Train</b> <b>Line,</b> the dancers formed two lines of equal length facing each other with a large space in between them. Each dancer in line would take their turn dancing down the middle.|$|E

5|$|Canada's {{first such}} public transit system, GO Transit began regular {{passenger}} service on May 23, 1967 {{as a part}} of the Ontario Ministry of Transportation. Since then, it has grown from a single <b>train</b> <b>line</b> to seven, and expanded to include complementing bus service. GO Transit has been constituted in a variety of public-sector configurations, today existing as an operating division of Metrolinx, a provincial Crown agency with overall responsibility for integrative transportation planning within the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} GCCS operations, the General Post Office (GPO) {{established}} a training school, and a women's {{teacher training college}} was opened in 1948. The Ministry of Aviation also opened the Navaid training school on part of the site. The GPO had blocks built in the south-east area of the site, and other blocks were adapted from their original conditions for new uses. The CTS division of GCHQ remained on the site within Blocks C and D until 1987. Aerial masts which had been erected by the division became unusable after the nearby <b>train</b> <b>line</b> was electrified, and were removed the year CTS left.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Sloatsburg station {{dates back}} to the 1830s, when the station was built along the Erie Railroad. The station served the line heading to Port Jervis northward, along with a stagecoach to Greenwood Lake three times a day. The station was {{populated}} by fishermen {{on their way to the}} lake, but has been the site of several accidents. These calamities include a derailed milk train in 1843 and a fatal accident between the <b>train</b> <b>line</b> and several mules and their owner in 1855. The station became part of Metro-North in 1983, when the service was created. The station was listed under a revitalization plan in 2005 to help serve its commuters.|$|E

5|$|Luton Town's {{first ground}} was at Dallow Lane, the former ground of Excelsior. The ground {{was next to}} the Dunstable to Luton <b>train</b> <b>line,</b> and players {{regularly}} claimed to have trouble seeing the ball because of smoke from the trains. A damaging financial loss during 1896–97 forced Luton to sell the stadium to stay afloat and, as a result, the club moved across the tracks to a stadium between the railway and Dunstable Road. The Dunstable Road ground was opened by Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford, who also donated £50 towards the £800 building costs. When the site was sold for housing in 1905, the club was forced to move again at short notice, to its present Kenilworth Road site, {{in time for the}} start of the 1905–06 season.|$|E
5|$|Government of Ontario Transit (later {{abbreviated}} as 'GO Transit') {{started as}} a three-year long experiment on May 23, 1967 running single-deck trains powered by diesel locomotives in push-pull configuration on a single rail line along Lake Ontario's shoreline. GO Train service ran throughout the day from Oakville to Pickering with limited rush hour train service to Hamilton. The experiment proved to be extremely popular; GO Transit carried its first million riders during its first four months, and averaged 15,000 per day soon after. This line, now divided as the Lakeshore East and Lakeshore West lines is the keystone corridor of GO Transit. Expansion of rail service continued in the 1970s and 1980s, aimed at developing ridership in {{with the introduction of}} the Georgetown (now Kitchener) line in 1974 and the Richmond Hill line in 1978. The Milton GO <b>Train</b> <b>line</b> opened in 1981, followed by the Bradford (now Barrie) and Stouffville lines a year later, establishing the 7 rail corridors that today's rail service is based upon.|$|E
5|$|The {{special-purpose}} card, Airport Express Tourist Octopus, {{was introduced}} by Octopus Cards Limited to target tourists in Hong Kong. Two versions of this card are offered, a HK$220 card with a free single ride on the Airport Express, the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) <b>train</b> <b>line</b> that runs between the Hong Kong International Airport and the urban areas of Hong Kong, and a HK$300 card with two free single rides included. The airport journeys are valid for 180 days from the date of purchase. Both versions allow three days of unlimited rides on the MTR and include a HK$50 refundable deposit. Usable value on these cards may be added if necessary. These tourist Octopus cards may be used only by tourists staying in Hong Kong for 14 or fewer days; users {{may be required to}} produce a passport showing their arrival date in Hong Kong. Airport Express Tourist Octopus is available for purchase at all MTR stations.|$|E

25|$|When {{the engine}} {{operator}} applies the brake by operating the locomotive brake valve, the <b>train</b> <b>line</b> vents to atmosphere at a controlled rate, reducing the <b>train</b> <b>line</b> pressure {{and in turn}} triggering the triple valve on each car to feed air into its brake cylinder. When the engine operator releases the brake, the locomotive brake valve portal to atmosphere is closed, allowing the <b>train</b> <b>line</b> to be recharged by the compressor of the locomotive. The subsequent increase of <b>train</b> <b>line</b> pressure causes the triple valves on each car to discharge {{the contents of the}} brake cylinder to the atmosphere, releasing the brakes and recharging the reservoirs.|$|E
25|$|The Westinghouse {{system is}} thus fail safeany {{failure in the}} <b>train</b> <b>line,</b> {{including}} a separation ("break-in-two") of the train, will cause a loss of <b>train</b> <b>line</b> pressure, causing the brakes to be applied and bringing the train to a stop, thus preventing a runaway train.|$|E
25|$|If the {{pressure}} in the <b>train</b> <b>line</b> is {{higher than that of}} the reservoir, the triple valve connects the <b>train</b> <b>line</b> to the reservoir feed, causing the air pressure in the reservoir to increase. The triple valve also causes the brake cylinder to be exhausted to the atmosphere, releasing the brakes.|$|E

25|$|The {{emergency}} {{portion of}} each triple valve is activated by the extremely rapid rate of reduction of <b>train</b> <b>line</b> pressure. Due {{to the length}} of trains and the small diameter of the <b>train</b> <b>line,</b> the rate of reduction is high near the front of the train (in the case of an engine operator-initiated emergency application) or near the break in the <b>train</b> <b>line</b> (in the case of the <b>train</b> <b>line</b> coming apart). Farther away from the source of the emergency application, the rate of reduction can be reduced to the point where triple valves will not detect the application as an emergency reduction. To prevent this, each triple valve's emergency portion contains an auxiliary vent port, which, when activated by an emergency application, also locally vents the train line's pressure directly to atmosphere. This serves to propagate the emergency application rapidly along {{the entire length of the}} train.|$|E
