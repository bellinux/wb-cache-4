25|$|Following the {{assassination}} of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, newly-inaugurated President Lyndon Johnson continued to press for the passage of <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill</b> sought by his predecessor.|$|E
25|$|Although {{one of the}} officially stated {{purposes}} of the march was to support <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill</b> introduced by the Kennedy Administration, several of the speakers criticized the proposed law as insufficient. Two government agents stood by {{in a position to}} cut power to the microphone if necessary.|$|E
25|$|During 1870, Langston {{assisted}} Republican Senator Charles Sumner from Massachusetts with drafting <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill</b> {{that was}} enacted as the Civil Rights Act of 1875. The 43rd Congress of the United States passed {{the bill in}} February 1875 and it {{was signed into law}} by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1875.|$|E
2500|$|In good conscience, {{we cannot}} support wholeheartedly <b>the</b> administration's <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill,</b> {{for it is}} too little and too late. ...|$|R
50|$|On some issues, though, he {{reflected}} {{the values of}} his largely Catholic and working-class district. He supported the Vietnam War until 1971. While he supported all of <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bills,</b> he opposed expanding school desegregation to Detroit suburbs via mandatory busing. He took a fairly moderate position on abortion. He worked to balance clean air legislation {{with the need to}} protect manufacturing jobs.|$|R
50|$|Over {{a hundred}} thousand, {{predominantly}} African Americans, gathered in Washington for <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963. Kennedy feared the March {{would have a}} negative effect on the prospects for <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bills</b> in Congress, and declined an invitation to speak. He turned over some of the details of the government's involvement to the Dept. of Justice, which channelled hundreds of thousands of dollars to the six sponsors of the March, including the N.A.A.C.P. and Martin Luther King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).|$|R
25|$|The Democratic Party, proclaiming {{itself the}} party of white men, north and south, {{supported}} Johnson. However the Republicans in Congress overrode his veto (the Senate by the close vote of 33:15, the House by 122:41) and <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>bill</b> became law. Congress also passed a toned-down Freedmen's Bureau Bill; Johnson quickly vetoed {{as he had done}} to the previous bill. Once again, however, Congress had enough support and overrode Johnson's veto.|$|E
25|$|Judiciary Committee {{chairman}} Celler filed {{a petition}} to discharge the bill from the Rules Committee; it required {{the support of a}} majority of House members to move the bill to the floor. Initially Celler had a difficult time acquiring the signatures necessary, with many congressmen who supported <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill</b> itself remaining cautious about violating normal House procedure with the rare use of a discharge petition. By the time of the 1963 winter recess, 50 signatures were still needed.|$|E
25|$|Johnson {{was quite}} {{familiar}} with the procedural tactic, as he {{played a role in}} a similar tactic against <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill</b> that Harry Truman had submitted to congress fifteen years earlier. In that fight, a rent-control renewal bill was held up until the civil-rights bill was withdrawn. Believing that the current course meant that the Civil Rights Act would suffer the same fate, he adopted a different strategy from that of Kennedy, who had mostly removed himself from the legislative process. By tackling the tax cut first, the previous tactic was eliminated.|$|E
5000|$|Following the June 20th, 2000 {{murder of}} Amanda Milan, Rivera briefly [...] "resurrected" [...] and renamed STAR on January 6, 2001. After being honoured in Italy, Rivera {{continued}} to work to advance the fight for <b>the</b> transgender <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill</b> in New York City and State and to fight for self-determination for all gender non-conformists.|$|R
5000|$|The Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage is a prize {{awarded by}} Georgia Institute of Technology to {{individuals}} who uphold the legacy of former Atlanta Mayor Ivan Allen Jr., whose actions in Atlanta, Georgia and testimony before congress in support of <b>the</b> 1963 <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Bill</b> legislation set a standard for courage during <b>the</b> turbulent <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> era of <b>the</b> 1960s.|$|R
2500|$|Lewis added a {{qualified}} endorsement of <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> legislation, saying: [...] "It {{is true that}} we support <b>the</b> administration's <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Bill.</b> We support it with great reservation, however." [...] Even after toning down his speech, Lewis called for activists to [...] "get in {{and stay in the}} streets of every city, every village and hamlet of this nation until true freedom comes".|$|R
500|$|After {{leaving the}} Nation of Islam, MalcolmX founded Muslim Mosque, Inc., a {{religious}} organization, and the Organization of Afro-American Unity, a secular group that advocated Pan-Africanism. On March26, 1964, he met Martin Luther King Jr. {{for the first}} and only timeand only long enough for photographs to be takenin Washington, D.C., as both men attended the Senate's debate on <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>bill.</b> In April, MalcolmX gave a speech titled [...] "The Ballot or the Bullet", in which he advised African Americans to exercise their right to vote wisely but cautioned that if the government continued to prevent African Americans from attaining full equality, it might be necessary for them to take up arms.|$|E
500|$|In early 1866, Congress and {{president}} battled over {{the extension of}} the authorization of the Freedmen's Bureau. [...] Both sides agreed that the bureau should end after the states were re-admitted, the question was whether that would be soon. With Seward's support, Johnson vetoed the bill. Republicans in Congress were angry with both men, and tried but failed to override Johnson's veto. [...] Johnson vetoed <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Bill,</b> which was to grant citizenship to the freedmen. [...] Seward advised a conciliatory veto message; Johnson ignored him, telling Congress it had no right to pass bills affecting the South until it seated the region's congressmen. This time Congress overrode his veto, gaining the necessary two-thirds majority of each house, the first time this had been done on a major piece of legislation in American history.|$|E
500|$|Although {{strongly}} {{urged by}} Moderates to sign <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Bill,</b> Johnson broke decisively with them by vetoing it on March 27. In his veto message, he {{objected to the}} measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen {{at a time when}} 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it discriminated in favor of African Americans and against whites. Within three weeks, Congress had overridden his veto, the first time that had been done on a major bill in American history. The veto of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, often seen as a key mistake of Johnson's presidency, convinced Moderates there was no hope of working with him. Historian Eric Foner in his volume on Reconstruction views it as [...] "the most disastrous miscalculation of his political career". According to Stewart, the veto was [...] "for many his defining blunder, setting a tone of perpetual confrontation with Congress that prevailed {{for the rest of his}} presidency".|$|E
5000|$|However, under {{pressure}} from the representatives of other groups many changes were made to the speech as it was delivered that day. According to James Forman, {{the most important of these}} was the change of [...] "we cannot support" [...] <b>the</b> Kennedy <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Bill</b> to [...] "we support with reservations". Forman wrote of the following explanation of this: ...|$|R
50|$|During {{his time}} in the legislature, Stokes was {{credited}} with initiating the idea of a state lottery, and for introducing one of <b>the</b> most sweeping <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bills</b> in <b>the</b> state up to that time.|$|R
50|$|I ask {{unanimous}} consent to have {{printed in the}} Congressional Record the weekly newsletter of my distinguished successor in the Seventh Congressional District of Virginia, Representative Burr P Harrison, in which he discussed <b>the</b> so-called <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill</b> now under consideration by the House. Representative Harrison's analysis is lucid and accurate, and I fully endorse the position he has taken in opposition to it.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the assassination, Lyndon B. Johnson made an address to Congress saying that [...] "No memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy's memory than the earliest possible passage of <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Bill</b> for which he fought so long." [...] The wave of national grief following the assassination gave enormous momentum to Johnson's promise to carry out Kennedy's plans and his policy of seizing Kennedy's legacy to give momentum to his legislative agenda.|$|E
2500|$|The {{assassination}} of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, changed the political situation. Kennedy's successor as president, Lyndon Johnson, {{made use of}} his experience in legislative politics, along with the bully pulpit he wielded as president, {{in support of the}} bill. In his first address to a joint session of Congress on November 27, 1963, Johnson told the legislators, [...] "No memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy's memory than the earliest possible passage of <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill</b> for which he fought so long." ...|$|E
2500|$|President Andrew Johnson Vetoed <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>bill</b> of 1866 amid {{concerns}} (among other things) that Congress did {{not have}} the constitutional authority to pass such a law. [...] Such doubts were one factor that led Congress to begin to draft and debate what would become the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Moreover, Congress wanted to protect white Unionists who were under personal and legal attack in the former Confederacy. The effort was led by the Radical Republicans of both houses of Congress, including John Bingham, Charles Sumner, and Thaddeus Stevens. The most important among these, however, was Bingham, a Congressman from Ohio, who drafted the language of the Equal Protection Clause.|$|E
2500|$|After Breathitt {{was elected}} Governor of Kentucky, <b>the</b> state <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill</b> was {{introduced}} to the General Assembly in 1964, but was buried in committee, and was never voted on. [...] "There {{was a great deal of}} racial prejudice existing at that time," [...] said Julian Carroll. A rally in support of Kentucky's proposed 1964 <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill</b> saw 10,000 Kentuckians in attendance, including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jackie Robinson, Ralph Abernathy, and folk musicians Peter, Paul, and Mary.|$|R
5|$|The General Assembly {{established}} the state's first sales tax at two percent in 1962. The {{revenues from the}} tax led {{to a host of}} new projects across the state. The General Assembly also passed <b>the</b> Indiana <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>bill</b> in 1963, granting equal protection to minorities in seeking employment. In 1970 a series of constitutional amendments were passed. Among them was one that authorized the General Assembly to meet annually instead of biennially.|$|R
50|$|In July 2011, Freedman-Gurspan join Sciortino's {{office as}} a {{legislative}} aide, becoming the first openly transgender legislative staffer in the Massachusetts State House. She played an instrumental role in helping Sciortino pass <b>the</b> transgender <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill</b> in November 2011, which {{was signed into law}} by then-Governor Deval Patrick in January 2012. Freedman-Gurspan worked as Sciortino's legislative director until he retired from the Massachusetts House of Representatives in the spring of 2014.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{strongly}} {{urged by}} moderates in Congress to sign <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>bill,</b> Johnson broke decisively with them by vetoing it on March 27, 1866. His veto message {{objected to the}} measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen {{at a time when}} eleven out of thirty-six states were unrepresented and attempted to fix by Federal law [...] "a perfect equality of the white and black races in every State of the Union." [...] Johnson said it was an invasion by Federal authority of the rights of the States; it had no warrant in the Constitution and was contrary to all precedents. It was a [...] "stride toward centralization and the concentration of all legislative power in the national government." ...|$|E
2500|$|The bill {{divided and}} engendered a {{long-term}} {{change in the}} demographic support of both parties. President Johnson realized that supporting this bill would risk losing the South's overwhelming support of the Democratic Party. Both Attorney General Robert Kennedy and Vice President Johnson had pushed for {{the introduction of the}} civil rights legislation. Johnson told Kennedy aide Ted Sorensen that [...] "I know the risks are great and we might lose the South, but those sorts of states may be lost anyway." [...] Senator Richard Russell, Jr. later warned President Johnson that his strong support for <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill</b> [...] "will not only cost you the South, it will cost you the election". Johnson, however, {{went on to win the}} 1964 election by one of the biggest landslides in American history. The South, which had five states swing Republican in 1964, became a stronghold of the Republican Party by the 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|Congress {{therefore}} {{acquired the}} power {{not only to}} legislate for the eradication of slavery, but the power to give full effect to this bestowment of liberty on these millions of people. All this it essayed to do by <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill</b> passed April 9, 1866, 14 Stat. 27, by which it was declared that all persons born in the United States, and not subject to a foreign power (except Indians, not taxed), should be citizens of the United States, and that such citizens, of every race and color, without any regard to any previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude, {{should have the same}} right, in every state and territory, to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, and give evidence to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property, and to full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property, as is enjoyed by white citizens, and should be subject to like punishment, pains, and penalties, and to none other, any law, etc., to the contrary notwithstanding.|$|E
5000|$|This event {{ended up}} {{being one of the}} most violent sit-ins. Mulholland {{recalled}} being told by reporters {{that it was one of}} the most frightening stories they had ever covered on <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Movement. <b>Bill</b> Minor, then the Mississippi correspondent covering <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> events for <b>the</b> New Orleans Times-Picayune and who was there that day, says the Jackson Woolworth's sit-in was [...] "the signature event of the protest movement in Jackson. The first one there was with real violence." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{first piece}} of {{legislation}} Schieffer passed was a bill renaming the State Finance Building the Lyndon B. Johnson State Office Building. Johnson, whom Schieffer admired greatly for passing <b>the</b> landmark <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bills</b> of 1964, 1965 and 1968 had died in January 1973. During his first session, Schieffer successfully argued for funding the Fort Worth State School - a mental health facility - receiving the editorial kudos of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram for having [...] "earned his spurs" [...] as an effective legislator in Austin.|$|R
50|$|However, on February 2, 1948, {{incumbent}} President Harry S. Truman, {{fearing that}} the antidemocratic practices and racial discrimination of the South would severely denigrate the United States’ {{reputation in the}} Cold War, launched <b>the</b> first <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>bill</b> since <b>the</b> end of Reconstruction, along with an executive order for desegregation of the military. Mississippi Governor Fielding Wright had already sounded a call for revolt, which he took to the Southern Governors Conference at Wakulla Springs to say that calls for <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> legislation by national Democrats would not be tolerated in Dixie.|$|R
2500|$|Wallace's {{strong showing}} {{was due in}} part to his appeal to ethnic neighborhoods made up of {{immigrants}} from countries such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Yugoslavia. Despite initial apprehension about campaigning in these communities, Wallace biographer Stephen Lesher credits him with recognizing that they were [...] "powerfully attracted to the message that <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill</b> might adversely affect their jobs, their property values, the makeup of their neighborhoods, and children's schools". Others note that Wallace's anti-Communist message resonated with communities whose home countries were behind the Iron Curtain of the Soviet Union, and a series of blunders by the Reynolds campaign added to an existing resentment of Reynolds' tax policies and a recently passed housing law. [...] "What Reynolds and most commentators would miss," [...] Lesher writes, was that Dolores Herbstreith, who had never participated in politics until she became the de facto Wallace campaign chair in the state, was [...] "neither a racist nor a crazy ... less interested in race and the Communist menace than in sowing conservative seeds that began sprouting with Barry Goldwater later that year and flowered with Ronald Reagan in the 1980s." ...|$|E
2500|$|Passing <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill</b> in {{the house}} {{required}} getting it through the Rules Committee, which had been holding it up {{in an attempt to}} kill it. Johnson decided on a campaign to use a discharge petition to force it onto the house floor. Facing a growing threat that they would be bypassed, the House rules committee approved the bill and moved it {{to the floor of the}} full house, which passed it shortly thereafter by a vote of 290–110. In the Senate, since the tax bill had passed three days earlier, the anti-civil-rights senators were left with the filibuster as their only remaining tool. Overcoming the filibuster required the support of over twenty Republicans, who were growing less supportive due to the fact that their party was about to nominate for president a candidate who opposed the bill. According to Caro, it was ultimately Johnson's ability to convince Republican leader Everett Dirksen to support the bill that amassed the necessary Republican votes to overcome the filibuster in March 1964; after 75 hours of debate, the bill passed the senate by a vote of 71–29. Johnson signed the fortified Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law on July 2. Legend has it that the evening after signing the bill, Johnson told an aide, [...] "I think we just delivered the South to the Republican party for a long time to come", anticipating a coming backlash from Southern whites against Johnson's Democratic Party.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{assassination}} of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, newly-inaugurated President Lyndon Johnson continued to press for the passage of <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill</b> sought by his predecessor.|$|E
5000|$|Over {{a hundred}} thousand, {{predominantly}} African Americans, gathered in Washington for <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963. Kennedy opposed the march, fearing {{it would have}} a negative effect on the prospects for <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bills</b> pending in Congress. These fears were heightened just prior to the march when FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover presented the administration with allegations that some of Martin Luther King Jr's close advisers, specifically Jack O'Dell and Stanley Levison, were communists. The President and Robert Kennedy together met with King on June 22, and strongly warned King to cut all ties with the both Levison and O'Dell. When King ignored the warning, Robert Kennedy issued a written directive authorizing the FBI to wiretap King and other leaders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, King's <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> organization in October 1963. Although Kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of King's phones [...] "on a trial basis, for a month or so", Hoover extended the clearance so his men were [...] "unshackled" [...] to look for evidence in any areas of King's life they deemed worthy. The wiretapping continued through June 1966 and was revealed in 1968.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Anderson Murray <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Bill</b> {{was passed}} in the Washington State House on January 20, 2006, in the Senate on January 27, 2006, and {{signed into law by}} Governor Christine Gregoire on January 31, 2006. When the bill was passed, Hutcherson again called for a boycott, but no such {{organized}} effort emerged.|$|R
50|$|Dole had a {{moderate}} voting record and was widely {{considered to be}} one of the few Kansas Republicans who could bridge the gap between the moderate and conservative wings of the Kansas Republican Party. As a Congressman in the early 1960s, Dole supported <b>the</b> major <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bills,</b> which appealed to moderates. When Johnson proposed the Great Society in 1964-65, Dole voted against some War on Poverty measures like public-housing subsidies and Medicare, thus appealing to conservatives. Dole's first speech in the Senate in 1969 was a plea for federal aid for the handicapped.|$|R
