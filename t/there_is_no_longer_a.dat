5|$|Formally, the Culver Line ends as {{the track}} curve enters {{the lower level}} of the double-decked station along the BMT Brighton Line's right-of-way, and the {{chaining}} track designation changes from IND tracks B1 and B2 to BMT tracks A1 and A2 of the Brighton Line.

5|$|Not only {{is there}} no reason {{to get rid of}} the Viceroy, but even if no part of Spain {{remained}} unsubdued, the Spaniards in America ought to take it back and resume command over it. America should only be ruled by the natives when <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>a</b> Spaniard there. If even a single member of the Central Junta of Seville were to land on our shores, we should receive him as the Sovereign.|$|E
5|$|Because Bath is unparished, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>a</b> {{city council}} (or parish council) — Bath City Council having ended in 1996 with the {{abolition}} of the district of Bath. The City of Bath's ceremonial functions, including its formal status as a city, its twinning arrangements, the mayoralty of Bath– which {{can be traced back to}} 1230– and control of the city's coat of arms, are maintained by the charter trustees of the City of Bath. The councillors elected by the electoral wards that cover Bath (see below) are the trustees, and they elect one of their number as mayor.|$|E
5|$|After the trachea {{has been}} intubated, a balloon cuff is {{typically}} inflated {{just above the}} far end of the tube to help secure it in place, to prevent leakage of respiratory gases, and to protect the tracheobronchial tree from receiving undesirable material such as stomach acid. The tube is then secured to the face or neck and connected to a T-piece, anesthesia breathing circuit, bag valve mask device, or a mechanical ventilator. Once <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>a</b> need for ventilatory assistance and/or protection of the airway, the tracheal tube is removed; this is referred to as extubation of the trachea (or decannulation, in the case of a surgical airway such as a cricothyrotomy or a tracheotomy).|$|E

25|$|Transvenous pacing, {{when used}} for {{temporary}} pacing, {{is an alternative}} to transcutaneous pacing. A pacemaker wire is placed into a vein, under sterile conditions, and then passed into either the right atrium or right ventricle. The pacing wire is then connected to an external pacemaker outside the body. Transvenous pacing is often used as a bridge to permanent pacemaker placement. It can be kept in place until a permanent pacemaker is implanted or until <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>a</b> need for a pacemaker and then it is removed.|$|E

25|$|With county, road, {{and school}} taxes {{steadily}} mounting {{even in the}} grazing sections of Texas, {{there is very little}} inducement left for the cattleman to buy large ranches at the present prices.

Because of present-day conditions, I would not take to organize a colonizing company, nor do I know anyone who could afford to do so except the large landowner who wishes to sell and colonize his own property exclusively.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example is}} {{obtained}} by replacing the planes, as model surfaces, by spheres, which are homogeneous under the Möbius group of conformal transformations. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>a</b> unique sphere tangent to a smooth surface S at each point, since the {{radius of the}} sphere is undetermined. This can be fixed by supposing that the sphere has the same mean curvature as S {{at the point of}} contact. Such spheres can again be rolled along curves on S, and this equips S with another type of Cartan connection called a conformal connection.|$|E
25|$|Fare for {{riding the}} line is $2.25 cash or single-ride tokens, which sell for $1.80 each. Tokens can be bought either at vending {{machines}} in most stations, or in multi-packs available at the cashier's booth in major stations such as 69th Street Terminal or Frankford Transportation Center. Payment of base fare includes free transfer to the Subway-Surface Lines at 30th, 15th, and 13th Street stations, {{as well as to}} the Broad Street Line at 15th street.
