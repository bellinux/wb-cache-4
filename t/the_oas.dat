5|$|Acheson was {{particularly}} worried that allowing {{the details of}} the coup to go public would damage the image of the US. The Rio Pact of 1947 had created the Organization of American States, or OAS, and this body had obtained jurisdiction over regional disputes from the United Nations.

If PBFORTUNE had become public knowledge, the fact that the US was supporting an invasion of a country that was also a member of <b>the</b> <b>OAS</b> would have represented a huge setback to US policy.

40|$|In this study, we {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} some features of <b>the</b> ophthalmic artery (<b>OA),</b> which supplies <b>the</b> internal {{structures of the}} orbit. We evaluated the origin, branches and the relationships of <b>the</b> <b>OA</b> with <b>the</b> optic nerve and carried out morphometric analyses. Our study was conducted on 60 human orbits. We evaluated <b>the</b> <b>OA</b> divided into three parts. The first part of OA usually runs along the infero-lateral aspect of the optic nerve. The second part of <b>the</b> <b>OA</b> passed over <b>the</b> optic nerve {{in most of the}} specimens and under the optic nerve in the other specimens. The third part of <b>the</b> <b>OA</b> ran medial to the optic nerve. Diameter of <b>the</b> <b>OA</b> was 1. 45 ± 0. 23 mm on the right and 1. 42 ± 0. 3 mm on the left. Diameter of the optic nerve was 4. 1 ± 0. 57 mm on the right and 4. 2 ± 0. 63 mm on the left. The mean intra-orbital length of the central retinal artery was 8. 2 ± 1. 6 mm on the right and 8. 5 ± 2. 03 mm on the left.

40|$|X-linked {{recessive}} {{ocular albinism}} type I (OA 1) {{is due to}} mutations in <b>the</b> <b>OA</b> 1 gene (approved gene symbol GPR 143), which is expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). <b>The</b> <b>Oa</b> 1 (Gpr 143) knockout mouse (Oa 1 -/-) model recapitulates many of <b>the</b> <b>OA</b> 1 retinal morphological anomalies, including a lower number of melanosomes of increased size in <b>the</b> RPE. <b>The</b> <b>Oa</b> 1 -/- mouse also displays some of the retinal developmental abnormalities observed in albino patients such as misrouting of the optic tracts. Here, we show that these anomalies are associated with retinal electrophysiological abnormalities, including significant decrease in a- and b-wave amplitude and delayed recovery of b-wave amplitude from photoreceptor desensitization following bright light exposure. This suggests that lack of <b>Oa</b> 1 in <b>the</b> RPE impacts on photoreceptor activity. More interestingly, adeno-associated viral vector-mediated Oa 1 gene transfer to the retina of <b>the</b> <b>Oa</b> 1 -/- mouse model results in significant recovery of its retinal functional abnormalities. In addition, Oa 1 retinal gene transfer increases the number of melanosomes in <b>the</b> <b>Oa</b> 1 -/- mouse RPE.

40|$|In this study, the {{preparation}} of N-pamitoyl chitosan (ChP) anchored oleic acid (OA) liposome was demonstrated. Two different types of water-soluble ChPs with different degrees of acylation (DA) were selected for this study. The presence of ChPs on <b>the</b> surface of <b>OA</b> liposome was confirmed with their micrographs and physicochemical properties. The "peeling off" effect {{on the surface of}} <b>the</b> ChP-anchored <b>OA</b> (OAChP) liposomes was observed on the atomic force microscope micrographs and confirmed the presence of the ChPs layer on the liposome surface. The surface tension of the OAChPs liposome solution was found to be higher than that of <b>the</b> <b>OA</b> liposome solution. This result indicated <b>the</b> removal of <b>OA</b> monomer by ChPs from the air-water interface. The increase in the minimum area per headgroup (A min) of <b>the</b> <b>OA</b> with <b>the</b> presence of ChPs has further proved <b>the</b> interaction between <b>OA</b> monomer and <b>the</b> hydrophobic moieties of the ChPs. The ChPs anchored onto <b>the</b> <b>OA</b> monolayer increased <b>the</b> curvature of the OAChP liposomes monolayer and reduced the liposome size. The size of the OAChP liposomes was reduced by 30 nm as compared with <b>the</b> unmodified <b>OA</b> liposome.
