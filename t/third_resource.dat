40|$|EXTENDED ABSTRACT: The paper {{presents}} three language resources enabling better full-text {{access to}} digitised printed historical Slovenian texts: a hand-annotated corpus, a hand-annotated lexicon of historical words {{and a collection}} of transcribed texts. The aim of the resources is twofold: on one hand they support empirical linguistic research (corpus, collection) and represent a reference tool for the research of historical Slovenian (lexicon) while on the other hand they may serve as training data for the development of Human Language Technologies enabling better full-text search in digital libraries containing Slovenian written cultural heritage, modernisation of historical texts, and the development of better technological solutions for text recognition and scanning. The hand annotated corpus of historical Slovenian contains the text from 1, 000 pages sampled from the years 1750 to 1900, two texts date {{to the end of the}} 16 th or 17 th century. The corpus contains a little more than 250, 000 word tokens; each of them being annotated with hand validated linguistic features: modernised form, lemma or base form, and morhpo-syntactic description. Thus the word token »ajfram« is annotated with the normalised form »ajfrom«, by the lemma »ajfer« and morphosyntactic description »Som« or »Samostalnik« (noun), »občni« (common), »moški« (masculine) and a modernised form »gorečnost« (fervour). At first the corpus was annotated automatically and then manually verified and corrected. The lexicon was created automatically from the hand-annotated corpus. It contains only attested word-forms and examples of use. The word-forms are ordered under their modern equivalents. All the modern forms of a particular word constitute a dictionary entry, defined by its lemma with conjoint information i. e. the morpho-syntactic description and the closest contemporary synonyms. Thus the entry »ajfrer/Som/gorečnost« is annotated by two modernised words »ajfra « and »ajfrom« and their archaic forms »ajfram« and »aifram« and by attestattion: »…shaz noi frihtei tu shebranje karbo sdei udrukono is velzhim aifram noi is flisam inu is andohtjo 3 vezhiere saporedama …« (Tapravi inu tazieli Colemone-Shegen, 1800, p. 183). At present, the lexicon contains over 25, 000 entries (including modern words in archaic texts), 50, 000 word-forms and 70, 000 archaic forms. The <b>third</b> <b>resource</b> is represented by an extensive collection of digitised texts similar to the corpus. The difference is that the words are annotated automatically by a tool developed to process historical Slovenian text named ToTrTaLe. The tool implements a pipeline, where it first tokenises the text and then attempts to transcribe the archaic words to their modern day equivalents. Then, the text is tagged and lemmatised using the models for modern Slovenian language. It contains about 5 million words of hand-corrected transcriptions from the following digitised texts: • Slovenian books and editions of the newspaper »Kmetijske in rokodelske novice«, digitised by the National University Library (NUK) in the frame of the EU project IMPACT (5000 pages); • Digital library AHLib, 1 comprising Slovenian books translated from German (100 books); • A selection of Slovenian books 2 All three resources (corpus, lexicon, collection) are encoded according to the Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines TEI P 5, which enable the definition of XML schemas for encoding texts for scholarly purposes. The home page of the project at [URL] enables access to the resources. The collection and the lexicon are available for on-line browsing, the corpus and the automatically annotated collection for linguistics searches via a concordancer, while all the resources can be also downloaded in their source XML form under the Creative Commons Attribution Licence. In future we expect to extend the resources, however, even their present scope is sufficient for corpus based diachronic studies of historical Slovenian language and for developing useful language technology tools for processing cultural heritage texts. </p...|$|E
40|$|Demand {{for high}} volumes of mobile data traffic with better quality-of-service (QoS) support and {{seamless}} network coverage is ever increasing, due to {{growth of the}} number of smart mobile devices and the applications that run on these devices. Also, most of these high volumes of data traffic demanding areas are covered by heterogeneous wireless networks, such as cellular networks and wireless local area networks (WLANs). Therefore, interworking mechanisms can be used in these areas to enhance the network capacity, QoS support and coverage. Interworking enhances network capacity and QoS support by jointly allocating resources of multiple networks and enabling user multi-homing, where multi-homing allows users to simultaneously communicate over multiple networks. It widens network coverage by merging coverage of individual networks. However, there are areas where interworking cannot improve network capacity or QoS support, such as the areas with coverage of only one networks. Therefore, to achieve network-wide uniform capacity and QoS support enhancements, interworking can be integrated with device-to-device (D 2 D) communication and small cell deployment techniques. One of the challenging issues that need to be solved before these techniques can be applied in practical networks is the efficient resource allocation, as it has a direct impact on the network capacity and QoS support. Therefore, this thesis focuses on studying and developing efficient resource allocation schemes for interworking heterogeneous wireless networks which apply D 2 D communication and small cell deployment techniques. First, uplink resource allocation for cellular network and WLAN interworking to provide multi-homing voice and data services is investigated. The main technical challenge, which makes the resource allocation for this system complicated, is that resource allocation decisions need to be made capturing multiple physical layer (PHY) and medium access control layer (MAC) technologies of the two networks. This is essential to ensure that the decisions are feasible and can be executed at the lower layers. Thus, the resource allocation problem is formulated based on PHY and MAC technologies of the two networks. The optimal resource allocation problem is a multiple time-scale Markov decision process (MMDP) as the two networks operate at different time-scales, and due to voice and data service requirements. A resource allocation scheme consisting of decision policies for the upper and the lower levels of the MMDP is derived. To reduce the time complexity, a heuristic resource allocation algorithm is also proposed. Second, resource allocation for D 2 D communication underlaying cellular network and WLAN interworking is investigated. Enabling D 2 D communication within the interworking system further enhances the spectrum efficiency, especially at areas where only one network is available. In addition to the technical challenges encountered in the first interworking system, interference management and selection of users' communication modes for multiple networks to maximize hop and reuse gains complicate resource allocation for this system. To address these challenges, a semi-distributed resource allocation scheme that performs mode selection, allocation of WLAN resources, and allocation of cellular network resources in three different time-scales is proposed. <b>Third,</b> <b>resource</b> allocation for interworking macrocell and hyper-dense small cell networks is studied. Such system is particularly useful for interference prone and high capacity demanding areas, such as busy streets and city centers, as it uses license frequency bands and provides a high spectrum efficiency through frequency reuse and bringing network closer to the users. The key challenge for allocating resources for this system is high complexity of the resource allocation scheme due to requirement to jointly allocate resources for a large number of small cells to manage co-channel interference (CCI) in the system. Further, the resource allocation scheme should minimize the computational burden for low-cost small cell base stations (BSs), be able to adapt to time-varying network load conditions, and reduce signaling overhead in the small cell backhauls with limited capacity. To this end, a resource allocation scheme which operates on two time-scales and utilizes cloud computing to determine resource allocation decisions is proposed. Resource allocation decisions are made at the cloud in a slow time-scale, and are further optimized at the BSs in a fast time-scale in order to adapt the decisions to fast varying wireless channel conditions. Achievable throughput and QoS improvements using the proposed resource allocation schemes for all three systems are demonstrated via simulation results. In summary, designing of the proposed resource allocation schemes provides valuable insights on how to efficiently allocate resources considering PHY and MAC technologies of the heterogeneous wireless networks, and how to utilize cloud computing to assist executing a complex resource allocation scheme. Furthermore, it also demonstrates how to operate a resource allocation scheme over multiple time-scales. This is particularly important if the scheme is complex and requires a long time to execute, yet the resource allocation decisions are needed to be made within a short interval...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to test informational efficiency of the financial market in a developing country, namely Turkey. Semi-strong form efficiency in stock market, foreign exchange market and interbank money market is investigated by using the direct Granger-causality tests. The paper reports significant deviations from efficient market hypothesis with respect to changes in market liquidity in all markets above for the period January 1989 to July 1995. It is also found that these markets are pairwise interdependent. However, market liquidity cannot be predicted by using developments in the financial market. The results of the paper have three major implications. First, domestic investors as well as foreign investors may benefit from the empirical results of the paper to develop profitable trading strategies since all information variables are low-cost and readily accessible. This result is of particular importance to the investors of the European Community (EC) due to the Customs Union Agreement, which has been effective on 1 January 1996, between Turkey and the EC.
