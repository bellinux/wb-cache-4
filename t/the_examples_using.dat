The image reconstruction based on a set of watermarked measurements is performed using the total variation minimization algorithm, allowing good quality of recovered image. The watermark can be efficiently detected within the recovered image, but only if we know the random measurement matrix used for image acquisition. This provides secure watermarking scenario.

However, the evaluation function is usually not known beforehand, and it might vary from user to user. In our system, users show the system several pairs of good and bad layout examples, and the system infers the evaluation function from <b>the</b> <b>examples</b> <b>using</b> genetic programming technique.

To this purpose Bayes formula, described in the first chapter, is used, to which an additional assumption of conditional independence is added {{so that it can}} be used dynamically. The second chapter describes an approximation algorithm, which is used for recursive approximation of the density of random variable that has been estimated by the Bayesian equation. The third chapter deals with the application of the whole model on a special form of logistic regression. Results are shown on <b>the</b> <b>examples</b> <b>using</b> simulated data.

40|$|Abstract. Developing {{a formal}} {{verification}} {{system that is}} powerful, modular, and provides good support for automation is challenging. In this paper, we explore the expressiveness, modularity, and automation of our recently proposed object propositions verification system, using two examples. The first example is a spreadsheet of simple cells that add their inputs and share their output with other spreadsheet cells. The second example is a simulator for two queues of jobs, one contain-ing large jobs the other small jobs, along with a producer, consumer, and controller. The examples illustrate challenges for modular reason-ing {{in the presence of}} shared state (the cells or queues). We specify <b>the</b> <b>examples</b> <b>using</b> object propositions, prove their correctness, and then compare to separation logic specifications with respect to modularity. We also present the translation rules needed for the automatic transla-tion of the object propositions verification methodology into the Boogie intermediate verification language. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{multistage}} recognition method {{built as a}} cascade of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier. MLP, being a distributed method, generalizes to learn a "rule" and the k-NN, being a local method, learns the localized "exceptions" rejected by the "rule. " Because the rule-learner handles {{a large percentage of}} <b>the</b> <b>examples</b> <b>using</b> a simple and general rule, only a small subset of the training set is stored as exceptions during training. Similarly during testing, most patterns are handled by the MLP and few are handled by k-NN thus causing only a small increase in memory and computation. A multistage method like cascading is a better approach than multiexpert methods like voting and stacking where all learners are used for all cases; the extra computation and memory for the second learner is unnecessary if we are sufficiently certain that the first one's response is correct. We discuss how such a system can be trained using cross validation. This me [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of a pro-gramming system that enables third-party developers to add spoken natural language (SNL) interfaces to standalone mo-bile applications. The central challenge is to create statistical recognition models that are accurate and resource-efficient {{in the face of}} the variety of natural language, while requir-ing little specialized knowledge from developers. We show that given a few examples from the developer, it is possible to elicit comprehensive sets of paraphrases of <b>the</b> <b>examples</b> <b>using</b> internet crowds. The exhaustive nature of these para-phrases allows us to use relatively simple, automatically de-rived statistical models for speech and language understand-ing that perform well without per-application tuning. We have realized our design fully as an extension to the Visual Studio IDE. Based on a new benchmark dataset with 3500 spoken instances of 27 commands from 20 subjects and a small de-veloper study, we establish the promise of our approach and the impact of various design choices.
