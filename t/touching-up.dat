500|$|The first {{member of}} the class was given a livery of plain black without lining; this was changed to the new {{standard}} British Railways Brunswick green that was applied to express passenger locomotives after nationalisation, despite the locomotive being classed as mixed traffic. This was lined in orange and black, and the class was given the power classification 7MT. [...] The [...] "Britannias" [...] were numbered under the new British Railways standard numbering system in the 70xxx series. [...] The locomotives were numbered between 70000 and 70054, and featured brass nameplates with an initial black background, followed by red, located on the smoke deflectors. Towards the end of steam plain green livery was substituted, with the <b>touching-up</b> of existing paintwork being preferred to full aesthetic overhaul.|$|E
60|$|Captain Sellers again {{referred}} to the <b>touching-up</b> properties of green paint. Mrs. Willett took it from him, apparently {{for the purpose of}} inspection, and he at once set out in search of the glue-pot.|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't know Kay's, Jimmy. You're {{thinking}} what you'd do {{if this had}} happened in Blackburn's. The two things aren't the same. Here the man would probably take it like a lamb. The feeling of the house would be against him. He'd find nobody to back him up. That's because Blackburn's is a decent house {{instead of being a}} sink like Kay's. If I tried the <b>touching-up</b> before the whole house game with our chaps, the man would probably reply by going for me, assisted by the whole strength of the company." ...|$|E
50|$|Also in {{the church}} are the Flemish {{painting}} La Virgen de la Mosca ("Virgin of the Fly") and an unusual sculpture of a Pregnant Virgin, dating to the 13th century. The painting of the Virgin of the Fly is especially unique because of the realistic portrayal of a fly on the tunic which covers the Virgen's knee. Studies of the work demonstrate that this insect was added later. These same studies have pointed out numerous <b>touchings-up</b> in the original painting, such as the halo that surrounds {{the head of the}} Virgin, previously covered by a veil, or the rich embroidery on the dress of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, whose face has a great resemblance with some paintings of Isabella I of Castile.|$|R
5000|$|In late 1945, Shidehara {{appointed}} Jōji Matsumoto, {{state minister}} without portfolio, {{head of a}} blue-ribbon committee of Constitutional scholars to suggest revisions. The Matsumoto Commission's recommendations (:ja:松本試案), made public in February 1946, were quite conservative (described by one Japanese scholar in the late 1980s as [...] "no more than a <b>touching-up</b> of the Meiji Constitution"). MacArthur rejected them outright and ordered his staff to draft a completely new document. An additional reason for this was that on 24 January 1946, Prime Minister Shidehara had suggested to MacArthur that the new Constitution should contain an article renouncing war.|$|E

5000|$|Some 1:43 scale diecasts {{like the}} Italian Polistil {{in the late}} 1960s with their Politoys M-Series, used a very {{handsome}} metal [...] "wire" [...] wheel, and Solido did {{as well in the}} early 1960s, but then beat that in their 100 and GAM 2 series in the 1970s by impressively copying the wheel styles from the actual vehicles. Thus Solidos usually had a unique wheel style for every model. To keep down production costs, the competition usually used one (often simple or unattractive) style common to most vehicles in their lines. Eventually, even for Solido, this became impractical and the company stopped using unique wheel designs around 1980. Another sign of uniqueness in detail were the web of gray plastic 'chains' seen on some trucks like 1974 Simca-Unic snow plough (Rixon 2005, 114).The trade-off in superior wheel detail was in not having all parts open or move, as seen with Politoys' M Series, Mebetoys or the German Gama Toys. Solidos would have an opening engine lid or doors, but not all parts moved. By the late 1970s, Solido's GAM 2 series more commonly had no moving parts. Nevertheless, Solido detail remained impeccable and their cars remained the industry standard (for the price) through the early 1990s, and with some <b>touching-up</b> held their own against collector models costing in the hundreds of dollars (Olson 2008, p. 26).|$|E
40|$|Image {{inpainting}} is {{the process}} of <b>touching-up</b> damaged or unwanted portions of a picture and is an important task in image processing. For this purpose Bornemann and März [J. Math. Imaging Vis., 28 (2007), pp. 259 – 278] introduced a very efficient method called Image Inpainting Based on Coherence Transport which fills the missing region by advecting the image information along integral curves of a coherence vector field from the boundary towards the interior of the hole. The mathematical model behind this method is a first-order functional advection PDE posed on a compact domain with all inflow boundary. We show that this problem is well-posed under certain conditions...|$|E
