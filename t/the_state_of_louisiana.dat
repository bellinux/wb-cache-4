5|$|After {{the mint}} closed, it {{performed}} {{a variety of}} functions for the Federal government. It was first downgraded to an assay office for the U.S. Treasury {{as it had been}} from 1876 to 1879. Then, in 1932, the assay office closed and the building was converted into a Federal prison, in which capacity it served until 1943. The Coast Guard then took over the building as a nominal storage facility, though in truth the structure was largely abandoned and left to decay until it was transferred to <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Louisiana</b> in 1965. During the Cold War, when many believed there to be a high risk of nuclear war, the old Mint was considered to be the best fallout shelter in the city.|$|E
5|$|In early September, {{officials}} announced that 1,400mobile homes, homes, and apartments would become available to residents whose dwellings became uninhabitable. House Resolution 5620 also included disaster aid to <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Louisiana.</b> In early December, the Small Business Administration (SBA) approved $33.2million worth of low-interest loans for repairs to homes and businesses. By then, FEMA had received about 43,600 applications for aid, while approving $35.9million in grants to over 18,000 households that were ineligible for {{loans from the}} SBA or were uninsured. In addition to the mobile homes already provided, FEMA spent $22.6 million on disaster housing.|$|E

When General Shepley was assigned as Chief of Staff to the XXV Corps commanded by Major General Godfrey Weitzel, de Peyster became an aide to Weitzel, and eventually his Chief of Staff. The unit de Peyster had originally joined, the 13th New York, was also assigned in the XXV Corps. He is credited with raising the first Union flag over the Confederate capitol of Richmond, Virginia after its fall.

5|$|Within {{months of}} his {{admission}} to the bar, Benjamin argued his first case before the Supreme Court of Louisiana and won. Still, clients were slow to come in his first years in practice, and he had enough free time to compile and publish, with Thomas Slidell, the Digest of the Reported Decisions of the Superior Court of the Late Territory of Orleans and the Supreme Court of <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Louisiana</b> in 1834, which required the analysis of 6,000 cases. The book was an immediate success and helped launch Benjamin's career. When Slidell published a revised edition in 1840, he did so alone, as Benjamin was too busy trying cases {{to allow him to}} participate.|$|E
5|$|The American {{alligator}} {{has also}} suffered serious declines from hunting and habitat loss throughout its range, threatening it with extinction. In 1967 it {{was listed as}} an endangered species, but the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and state wildlife agencies in the Southern United States stepped in and worked towards its recovery. Protection allowed the species to recuperate, and in 1987 it {{was removed from the}} endangered species list. Much research into alligator ranching has been undertaken at the Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge, a large area of marshland in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Louisiana.</b> The resulting data has increased understanding of penning, stocking rates, egg incubation, hatching, rearing, and diet, and this information has been used at other establishments around the world. Income from the alligators kept at Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge contributes to conservation of the marshland. A study examining alligator farms in the United States showed that they have generated significant conservation gains, and poaching of wild alligators has greatly diminished.|$|E
5|$|The dish {{combines}} {{ingredients and}} culinary practices of several cultures, including French, Spanish, German, Filipino, West African, and Choctaw. Gumbo {{may have been}} based on traditional West African or native dishes, or may be a derivation of the French dish bouillabaisse, or Choctaw stew, but most likely all three dishes contributed to the original recipe. It was first described in 1802, and was listed in various cookbooks {{in the latter half of}} the 19th century. The dish gained more widespread popularity in the 1970s, after the United States Senate dining room added it to the menu in honor of Louisiana Senator Allen Ellender. The popularity of chef Paul Prudhomme in the 1980s spurred further interest in the dish. Gumbo is the official cuisine of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Louisiana.</b>|$|E

5|$|The ritual form {{on which}} the Grand Orient of France was based was {{abolished}} in England in the events leading {{to the formation of}} the United Grand Lodge of England in 1813. However the two jurisdictions continued in amity (mutual recognition) until events of the 1860s and 1870s drove a seemingly permanent wedge between them. In 1868 the Supreme Council of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Louisiana</b> appeared in the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Louisiana, recognised by the Grand Orient de France, but regarded by the older body as an invasion of their jurisdiction. The new Scottish rite body admitted blacks, and the resolution of the Grand Orient the following year that neither colour, race, nor religion could disqualify a man from Masonry prompted the Grand Lodge to withdraw recognition, and it persuaded other American Grand Lodges to do the same.|$|E
