40|$|This article {{examines}} the musical lives and experiences of Aboriginal children in Australia. It focuses on the Yanyuwa and Garrwa children living in the remote community at Burrulula in the south-west Gulf of Carpentaria, and urban Aboriginal children in Darwin. One {{of the biggest challenges}} faced by the children is the conflict of trying to be Aboriginal in a non-Aboriginal mainstream society. This tension is reflected in their musical choices, activities, and understandings. The children also struggle with the same questions relating to their identity as Indigenous Australians: <b>should</b> <b>they</b> be “shame” to be Aboriginal or <b>should</b> <b>they</b> be proud? <b>Should</b> <b>they</b> listen to Aboriginal music because that’s who <b>they</b> are? Or <b>should</b> <b>they</b> listen to the music that has meaning for them in their lives as children...|$|R

However, <b>they</b> <b>should</b> not usually be given for longer than 2–4 weeks. The only medications NICE recommends for the longer term management of GAD are antidepressants.|$|E

5|$|Chomsky {{argues that}} the multi-party, representative, liberal {{democracy}} that governs the United States is insufficiently democratic, instead advocating a form of participatory, direct democracy through which the ordinary citizens have a direct say in public policy. As such, he advocates that communities take {{a different approach to}} the upcoming primary elections; instead of simply listening to speeches given by the politicians hoping to be elected, <b>they</b> <b>should</b> get together in democratic councils and discuss what issues they want addressing. That done, Chomsky argues, <b>they</b> <b>should</b> approach the politicians, informing them that they have no interest in their speeches, but that if they want to get elected, they must come and listen {{to the demands of the}} people; alternately, he argues, these communities should select their own representatives whom they could then vote for.|$|E

He maintained that religion cannot be denounced as wrong {{because it is not}} empirical.|$|E
