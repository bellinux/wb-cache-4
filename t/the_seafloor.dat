5|$|The {{creation}} of the abyssal plain {{is the result of}} the spreading of <b>the</b> <b>seafloor</b> (plate tectonics) and the melting of the lower oceanic crust. Magma rises from above the asthenosphere (a layer of the upper mantle), and as this basaltic material reaches the surface at mid-ocean ridges, it forms new oceanic crust, which is constantly pulled sideways by spreading of <b>the</b> <b>seafloor.</b> Abyssal plains result from the blanketing of an originally uneven surface of oceanic crust by fine-grained sediments, mainly clay and silt. Much of this sediment is deposited by turbidity currents that have been channelled from the continental margins along submarine canyons into deeper water. The rest is composed chiefly of pelagic sediments. Metallic nodules are common in some areas of the plains, with varying concentrations of metals, including manganese, iron, nickel, cobalt, and copper.|$|E

5|$|The bluespotted {{stingray}} {{feeds on}} shrimp, small bony fish, mollusks, crabs and other worms. Due {{to the fact}} that this ray is a shallow bottom feeder, it has a small variety of marine life to prey on. The bluespotted stingray overpowers its prey by pinning them to the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>seafloor</b> with its fins. The bluespotted stingray has numerous tiny teeth, with the lower jaw being slightly convex. They also, like most stingrays, have plate-like teeth to crush prey.|$|E

A week after Rusty passed through Pilbara, an algal bloom the size of Tasmania appeared offshore. Unprecedented turbidity from the storm stirred up a large column of nutrients from <b>the</b> <b>seafloor</b> and brought it to the surface, causing the rapid increase in algae. Despite its size, it was not expected to have any lasting effects in the region.|$|E

5|$|Kīlauea {{has been}} active {{throughout}} its history. Since 1918, Kīlauea's only prolonged period of rest was an 18-year pause between 1934 and 1952. The bulk of Kīlauea consists of solidified lava flows, intermittent with scattered volcanic ash and tephra sourced from relatively lower-volume explosive eruptions. Much of the volcano is covered in historical flows, and 90 percent of its surface dates from the last 1,100 years. Kīlauea built itself up from <b>the</b> <b>seafloor</b> over time, and thus much of its bulk remains underwater; its subaerial surface {{is in the form}} of a gently sloping, elongate, decentralized shield with a surface area of approximately , making up 13.7 percent of the island's total surface area.|$|E
5|$|Opabinia regalis is an extinct, stem group {{arthropod}} {{found in}} the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale Lagerstätte of British Columbia, Canada. Fewer than twenty good specimens have been described; 3 specimens of Opabinia are known from the Greater Phyllopod bed, where they constitute less than 0.1% of the community. Opabinia was a soft-bodied animal of modest size, and its segmented body had lobes along the sides and a fan-shaped tail. The head shows unusual features: five eyes, a mouth under the head and facing backwards, and a proboscis that probably passed food to the mouth. Opabinia probably lived on <b>the</b> <b>seafloor,</b> using the proboscis to seek out small, soft food.|$|E
5|$|Owing in part {{to their}} vast size, abyssal plains are {{believed}} to be major reservoirs of biodiversity. They also exert significant influence upon ocean carbon cycling, dissolution of calcium carbonate, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations over time scales of a hundred to a thousand years. The structure of abyssal ecosystems are strongly influenced by the rate of flux of food to <b>the</b> <b>seafloor</b> and the composition of the material that settles. Factors such as climate change, fishing practices, and ocean fertilization have a substantial effect on patterns of primary production in the euphotic zone.|$|E

5|$|Seamounts are {{volcanic}} mountains which {{rise from}} <b>the</b> <b>seafloor.</b> The unlimited {{supply of water}} surrounding these volcanoes can cause them to behave differently from volcanoes on land. The lava emitted in eruptions at Bowie Seamount is made of basalt, a common gray to black or dark brown volcanic rock low in silica content (the lava is mafic). When basaltic lava makes contact with the cold sea water, it may cool very rapidly to form pillow lava, through which the hot lava breaks to form another pillow. Pillow lava is typically fine-grained, due to rapid cooling, with a glassy crust, and has radial jointing.|$|E
5|$|Sediments {{of certain}} abyssal plains contain {{abundant}} mineral resources, notably polymetallic nodules. These potato-sized concretions of manganese, iron, nickel, cobalt, and copper, distributed on <b>the</b> <b>seafloor</b> at depths of greater than 4000meters, are of significant commercial interest. The area of maximum commercial interest for polymetallic nodule mining (called the Pacific nodule province) lies in international {{waters of the}} Pacific Ocean, stretching from 118°–157°, and from 9°–16°N, an area of more than 3 million km². The abyssal Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone (CCFZ) is an area within the Pacific nodule province that is currently under exploration for its mineral potential.|$|E
5|$|Sister Peak (Comfortless Cove Hydrothermal Field, , {{elevation}} −2996m), Shrimp Farm and Mephisto (Red Lion Hydrothermal Field, , elevation −3047m), {{are three}} hydrothermal vents {{of the black}} smoker category, on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near Ascension Island. They are presumed to have been active since an earthquake shook the region in 2002. These vents have been observed to vent phase-separated, vapor-type fluids. In 2008, sustained exit temperatures of up to 407°C were recorded {{at one of these}} vents, with a peak recorded temperature of up to 464°C. These thermodynamic conditions exceed the critical point of seawater, and are the highest temperatures recorded to date from <b>the</b> <b>seafloor.</b> This is the first reported evidence for direct magmatic-hydrothermal interaction on a slow-spreading mid-ocean ridge.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century the United States Coast Survey {{embarked}} on an ambitious program to map <b>the</b> <b>seafloors</b> of <b>the</b> world's main oceanways. This produced extensive maps of the more shallow areas, but deep-ocean work was hampered by lack of robust equipment. In 1872, English scientist Sir William Thomson invented a wire-based depth-sounding mechanism which was a significant improvement over rope-type equipment used previously. This Thomson Sounding Machine made its first discovery in 1874, of several seamounts west of the Hawaiian Islands. [...] Its second use was on the , an ocean-going vessel used in 1875 to extensively map <b>the</b> Eastern Atlantic <b>seafloor.</b> <b>The</b> ship was commanded by Captain Henry Honychurch Gorringe. On 6 November 1875 this expedition discovered the raised area (which {{was referred to as}} Gorringe Bank in reference to the ship's captain), and spent time mapping it. They determined that it contained two significant peaks, which they named Gettysburg (the highest, at 20 meters depth) and Ormonde (the second highest, at 33 meters depth).|$|R

One controller was broken open on one side, and both were severely corroded and damaged by marine life. Both units were disassembled and the memory units flushed with deionized water. After they were dried and vacuum baked, data from these units was retrieved for forensic examination.|$|E
5|$|Thermoremanent {{magnetization}} is {{the main}} source of the magnetic anomalies around ocean ridges. As <b>the</b> <b>seafloor</b> spreads, magma wells up from the mantle, cools to form new basaltic crust {{on both sides of the}} ridge, and is carried away from it by seafloor spreading. As it cools, it records the direction of the Earth's field. When the Earth's field reverses, new basalt records the reversed direction. The result is a series of stripes that are symmetric about the ridge. A ship towing a magnetometer on the surface of the ocean can detect these stripes and infer the age of the ocean floor below. This provides information on the rate at which seafloor has spread in the past.|$|E
5|$|Europa has the smoothest {{surface of}} any known solid {{object in the}} Solar System. The {{apparent}} youth and smoothness of the surface {{have led to the}} hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which could conceivably harbor extraterrestrial life. The predominant model suggests that heat from tidal flexing causes the ocean to remain liquid and drives ice movement similar to plate tectonics, absorbing chemicals from the surface into the ocean below. Sea salt from a subsurface ocean may be coating some geological features on Europa, suggesting that the ocean is interacting with <b>the</b> <b>seafloor.</b> This may be important in determining if Europa could be habitable. In addition, the Hubble Space Telescope detected water vapor plumes similar to those observed on Saturn's moon Enceladus, which are thought to be caused by erupting cryogeysers.|$|E

30|$|In convex-upward <b>seafloor</b> regions, <b>the</b> BSR was {{situated}} at a deeper depth; therefore, the heat flow values there {{were lower than}} in neighboring areas (Fig.  7). Rapid sedimentation causes low surface heat flow values, apparently due to a delay in recovery from the disturbed thermal equilibrium. However, sedimentation in <b>the</b> convex-upward <b>seafloor</b> regions was not likely to occur because of their geometry. Therefore, we considered that this low heat flow was caused by topography rather than rapid sedimentation. In contrast, in <b>the</b> convex-downward <b>seafloor</b> regions, <b>the</b> BSR was shallower and the values were higher {{than those in the}} surrounding areas (Fig.  7), apparently because rapid erosion caused high surface heat flow values. However, erosion in <b>the</b> convex-downward <b>seafloor</b> regions was not likely to occur because of their geometry.

5|$|Outside of the Black Hills, much {{of western}} South Dakota {{features}} rock formed during the Mesozoic Era, from 250 million to 66million years ago. At the time, much of western and central South Dakota was again {{covered by a}} shallow inland sea. Marine skeletons from this ocean settled to <b>the</b> <b>seafloor</b> and were compacted to form the sedimentary rocks in the area today. During this period, the Black Hills, which had been pushed up to an elevation of around 15,000feet (4,500m), lost around 6,000feet (1,800m) worth of rock layers due to erosion. Many of these sediments {{ended up in the}} same area as the marine deposits from the inland sea, and both contribute to western South Dakota's present-day geological makeup. In several areas in western South Dakota, tertiary deposits may also be found. These were formed between 66 and 2.5million years ago from eroded mountains to the west. There is also volcanic material deposited here that presumably came from the Yellowstone area. These layers of sedimentary rock are distinctly visible in the multi-colored rocks and cliffs of Badlands National Park.|$|E
5|$|So far, {{there is}} no {{evidence}} that life exists on Europa, but Europa has emerged as one of the most likely locations in the Solar System for potential habitability. Life could exist in its under-ice ocean, perhaps in an environment similar to Earth's deep-ocean hydrothermal vents. Even if Europa lacks volcanic hydrothermal activity, a 2016 NASA study found that Earth-like levels of hydrogen and oxygen could be produced through processes related to serpentinization and ice-derived oxidants, which do not directly involve volcanism. In 2015, scientists announced that salt from a subsurface ocean may likely be coating some geological features on Europa, suggesting that the ocean is interacting with <b>the</b> <b>seafloor.</b> This may be important in determining if Europa could be habitable. The likely presence of liquid water in contact with Europa's rocky mantle has spurred calls to send a probe there.|$|E
5|$|The Hawaiian–Emperor {{seamount}} chain {{is a series}} of volcanoes and seamounts extending across the Pacific Ocean. The chain has been produced by the movement of the ocean crust over the Hawaii hotspot, an upwelling of hot rock from the Earth's mantle. As the oceanic crust moves the volcanoes farther away from their source of magma, their eruptions become less frequent and less powerful until they eventually cease to erupt altogether. At that point erosion of the volcano and subsidence of <b>the</b> <b>seafloor</b> cause the volcano to gradually diminish. As the volcano sinks and erodes, it first becomes an atoll island and then an atoll. Further subsidence causes the volcano to sink below the sea surface, becoming a seamount and/or a guyot. This list documents the most significant volcanoes in the chain, ordered by distance from the hotspot; however, there are many others that have yet to be properly studied.|$|E
