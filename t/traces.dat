An important question is how much investment into <b>tracing</b> seems reasonable in an environment. This paper proposes an initial <b>tracing</b> activity model for <b>trace</b> generation and usage to help determine <b>tracing</b> efforts and support test managers in tailoring the expected <b>tracing</b> effort with the parameters: <b>tracing</b> strategies, test case creation effort, and change request severity. Using the <b>tracing</b> activity model we report a re-testing industry feasibility study that compares effort, risk, and delay of 3 <b>tracing</b> strategies: ad hoc <b>trace</b> reuse (ATR), no <b>trace</b> reuse (NTR), and systematic trace-based retesting (TBRT). Main results of the feasibility study were: 1. The <b>tracing</b> activity model was useful to model and compare overall efforts of <b>tracing</b> alternatives. 2. TBRT took a) around 77 % effort of the NTR strategy and b) 40 % effort of the ATR strategy effort with similar re-testing risk and less delay...|$|R
