5|$|There {{had been}} plans {{to create a}} westeast spur of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike</b> called Route 92. It was to begin {{just north of the}} {{intersection}} of Ridge Road and U.S. Route 1 in South Brunswick and terminate at the mainline of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike</b> (I-95) at Exit 8A in Monroe Township. This proposal was cancelled on December 1, 2006, after <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike</b> Authority decided to use funds to widen the mainline turnpike instead.|$|E
5|$|Newark Bay Extension of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike</b> for Interstate78 {{was opened}} in 1956 {{to provide access}} from <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike</b> to the Holland Tunnel.

5|$|I-280 {{continues}} to run {{just north of}} the railroad as a six-lane freeway through Harrison, reaching an interchange with CR 508. The road continues southeast through urban surroundings before turning east and passing to the north of a railroad yard, splitting from the railroad line as it runs into Kearny and enters the New Jersey Meadowlands. At the final interchange with CR 508, I-280 has access to the Holland Tunnel via Route 7, US 1/9 Truck and Route 139. Past CR 508, the freeway narrows to four lanes and comes to the toll plaza for <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike</b> (I-95) at exit 15W, at which point I-280 ends. Full access is provided with the Western Spur of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike,</b> which carries through I-95 traffic; ramps to and from the north on the Eastern Spur of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike</b> allow for access to the Lincoln Tunnel via Route 495.|$|E

5|$|The first {{plans for}} Route 92's new alignment, running from Exit8A of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike</b> (rather than exit8) west to U.S. Route 206 near Rocky Hill, {{were made in}} 1988, using funds from the {{canceled}} Somerset Freeway. In 1992, the plans were formally transferred to <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike</b> Authority, which announced the new plans in 1994, again dropping the segment west of US 1. All but $6.5 million of the $400 million project was reassigned in November 2005 to widen the Turnpike in southern New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|After US 9 heads east {{away from}} the parkway, it reaches a {{cloverleaf}} interchange with Route 184/CR 501 and continues into a business district. A short distance later, the highway crosses over the access road between the Garden State Parkway and <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike</b> {{just east of the}} toll plaza and then <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike</b> itself. From this point, the highway passes several office parks, reaching an interchange with CR 514. After CR 514, the route passes some residential neighborhoods before passing to the east of the Woodbridge Center shopping mall. After passing under a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad line, US 9 junctions with CR 604 prior to merging with US 1.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of I-287's New Jersey portion in 1993, more out-of-state tractor trailer drivers began to use the alignment of Route31 as a toll-free alternative to <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike.</b> On July 16, 1999, oversize trucks were banned from using Route31 {{as part of a}} larger statewide ban imposed on New Jersey roads not a part of the National Highway System by then-governor Christine Todd Whitman. The legislation had a significant effect on trucks that followed Route31 as it forced them to use I-287 and <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike</b> instead. In themid-2000s, the portion of Route31 was widened during extensive construction between Flemington and Clinton that widened the road to four lanes.|$|E
50|$|Double track resumes under <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike's</b> {{western spur}} after 0.4 mile of single track. The train {{continues}} through the Meadowlands and passes {{the first grade}} crossing at Valley Brook Avenue in Lyndhurst. The line curves slightly and passes through the 1903 Kingsland tunnel. Kingsland station is shortly after the tunnel in an open cut. Just beyond Kingsland station is Lyndhurst station, on an embankment.|$|R
50|$|The Newark Bay Bridge, officially the Vincent R. Casciano Memorial Bridge, is a {{steel through}} arch bridge that is {{continuous}} across three spans. It crosses Newark Bay and connects {{the cities of}} Newark (in Essex County) and Bayonne (in Hudson County) in <b>New</b> <b>Jersey,</b> United States. It was completed April 4, 1956, as part of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike's</b> Newark Bay (Hudson County) Extension, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony led by Governor of <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> Robert B. Meyner.|$|R
50|$|The Upper Bay Bridge, or the Lehigh Valley Railroad Bridge, is a {{vertical}} lift bridge spanning the Newark Bay in northeastern <b>New</b> <b>Jersey.</b> It is used by CSX Transportation travelling through the North Jersey Shared Assets Area of the United States rail network along the National Docks Secondary line. The bridge is just north and parallel to <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike's</b> Newark Bay Bridge. A notable train using the bridge is the Juice Train, which originates in Florida.|$|R
5|$|It was legislated in 1966 to run {{parallel}} to <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike</b> from exit 13 until North Avenue, {{where it would}} turn northwest and intersect U.S. Route 1/9 near the airport. The routing was eventually shifted to begin from a new interchange along <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike.</b> A total of $50 million in funding was allocated for {{the road and the}} Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was responsible for designing the road. The state had wanted the port authority to pay for construction; however it was ruled that they could not build the road. Construction on Route 81 took place between 1979 and 1982.|$|E
5|$|The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) {{has studied}} {{proposals}} to expand I-195 from Exit 16 near Six Flags to <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike</b> from 4 to 6 total lanes, which {{would eliminate the}} grass median in the process.|$|E
5|$|The road enters Mansfield Township {{where it}} widens into a four-lane divided highway as it intersects {{a road that}} {{provides}} access to parallel CR545 to the east, which heads south {{to serve as an}} access road to McGuire Air Force Base. From here, the route turns northwest and crosses CR543 before heading through a mix of farm fields and suburban residential neighborhoods. Past the intersection with White Pine Road, Route 68 passes in between two large auto auction lots. The route terminates at an intersection with US206 located a short distance south of that route's interchange with <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike</b> (Interstate 95). Route 68 serves as the main access route between Fort Dix and <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike.</b>|$|E
50|$|Originally {{created to}} be a {{connection}} {{to one of the}} then-proposed freeways in <b>New</b> <b>Jersey,</b> <b>the</b> Commodore Barry Bridge was to connect Interstate 95 near Chester to, at one point, the Atlantic City Expressway near Hammonton, but those plans were eventually scrapped when it was realized that many people in the college town of Glassboro would be affected. There are new talks of possibly upgrading US 322 to a freeway from US 130 to Interstate 295's current Exit 11, or even as far as <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike's</b> Exit 2. There is no mention if this new freeway would be included in the Interstate Highway System, though it hasn't been ruled out yet, either.|$|R
50|$|Snake Hill (known officially as Laurel Hill) is an {{igneous rock}} {{intrusion}} jutting {{up from the}} floor of the Meadowlands in southern Secaucus, <b>New</b> <b>Jersey,</b> USA, at a bend in the Hackensack River. It was largely obliterated in the 1960s by quarrying that reduced the height of some sections by one-quarter and the area of its base by four fifths. The diabase rock was used as building material in growing areas like Jersey City. The remnant of the hill is the defining feature of Laurel Hill County Park. The high point, a 203-foot (62 m) graffiti-covered inselberg rock formation, is a familiar landmark to travelers on <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike's</b> Eastern Spur, which skirts the hill's southern edge. The crest of the hill's unusual, sloping ridge is about 150 feet (46 m) high.|$|R
25|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> Department of Transportation in 1972, the Route 85 Freeway {{would have}} begun at an {{interchange}} with Interstate 78 (the Newark Bay Extension and the Holland Tunnel Approach) {{in the community}} of Jersey City. The route would head northward as an eight-lane freeway, changing to 10 lanes at Sip Avenue. The 10 lanes would be in an express-local format, with two local lanes serving interchanges and three express lanes for faster approaches. The route have its second interchange at the Pulaski Skyway with U.S. Routes 1 and 9 in Jersey City, where it would parallel the congested two-lane Tonnelle Avenue. The route would continue northward, paralleling <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike's</b> eastern spur, interchanging with <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> Route 3 in North Bergen. Route 85 would continue northward as a 10-lane freeway to an interchange with Interstate 495 (now NJ 495), which would serve access to the Lincoln Tunnel.|$|R
5|$|The skyway was a {{constraint}} in {{the building}} of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike</b> in 1951. The turnpike had to be built low enough to provide enough clearance underneath the skyway, but high enough to then provide sufficient clearance over the nearby Passaic River. Turnpike engineers could have built over the skyway (at a much higher cost) or under the skyway's trusses; the latter option was chosen. As part of a 2005 seismic retrofit project, <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike</b> Authority lowered the Passaic River Viaduct Bridge on its easterly alignment to increase vertical clearance and allow for full-width shoulders underneath the Pulaski Skyway. Engineers replaced the bearings and lowered the turnpike bridge by , without shutting it to traffic.|$|E
5|$|In April 1954, $233 {{million in}} bonds were issued {{to finance the}} {{building}} of the Delaware River Bridge and the Northeastern Extension. Groundbreaking for the Delaware River Bridge connecting the Pennsylvania Turnpike to <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike</b> took place on June 26, 1954 in Florence, New Jersey. The steel arch bridge, which opened to traffic on May 23, 1956, was funded jointly by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission and <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike</b> Authority. Pennsylvania Governor George M. Leader and New Jersey Governor Robert B. Meyner were present at the opening ceremony. A mainline toll barrier was built {{to the west of the}} bridge, marking the eastern end of the ticket system. This bridge was originally six lanes wide. It contained no median, but one was later installed and the bridge was reduced to four lanes.|$|E
5|$|The route widens {{to eight}} lanes {{and enters the}} New Jersey Meadowlands, {{crossing}} into East Rutherford and then passing over the Berrys Creek. Route 3 passes {{to the south of}} the Meadowlands Sports Complex and has access to Route 120, MetLife Stadium (the home stadium of the New York Giants and New York Jets of the National Football League), and the Meadowlands Racetrack in the eastbound direction and to MetLife Stadium and the Meadowlands Racetrack in the westbound direction. The route narrows back to six lanes and comes to a ramp which provides access to the western spur of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike</b> (Interstate 95). Route 3 interchanges with Route 120 and the carriageways separately. The route passes under the western spur of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike</b> and becomes eight lanes again.|$|E
50|$|In late 2009, satellite-positioning {{receivers}} {{for a new}} {{navigation system}} at Newark airport in <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> were suffering brief daily breaks in reception. Something was interfering with the signals from orbiting global positioning system (GPS) satellites. A driver who passed by on <b>the</b> nearby <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike</b> each day used a cheap GPS jammer in his truck. Jammers prevent tracking devices from determining (and then reporting) its location.|$|R
25|$|The {{station was}} built with little public parking, as NJT {{believed}} few passenger trips would originate at the transfer point. In 2005, Exit 15X on <b>the</b> adjacent <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike</b> opened to provide {{easier access to}} the station from the surrounding area. Two years later, 15X was the least-used interchange on the turnpike, {{due in part to}} the lack of parking at the station. On June 1, 2009, Edison Parkfast, a private company, opened the first parking lot near the station, with space for 1,094 cars. Bicycle parking is also available.|$|R

5|$|The {{first section}} of Route 7 begins at an {{intersection}} with U.S. Route 1-9 Truck and County Route 645 (Charlotte Avenue) in Jersey City, Hudson County, heading to the west on a four-lane highway that is signed eastwest. The route crosses the Hackensack River on the Wittpenn Bridge into Kearny. Route 7 interchanges with County Route 659 (Fish House Road) and widens to a six-lane divided highway. The route than passes by industrial areas and a railroad yard and then interchanges with County Route 508. Past this interchange, Route 7 becomes the four-lane, divided Belleville Turnpike, with {{the eastern end of}} the Newark Turnpike running in the division between the two sides of Route 7. It then becomes an undivided two-lane road, heading northwest, narrowing to two lanes before it passes through the New Jersey Meadowlands, under the mainline of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike</b> (Interstate 95) and then the western spur of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike</b> a short distance later.|$|E
5|$|From this interchange, {{the road}} {{continues}} northeast through industrial areas to an interchange with US 1/9 Truck that {{provides access to}} <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Turnpike</b> (I-95). US 1/9 continue onto the Pulaski Skyway, which carries the route over the Passaic River into Hudson County, crossing over Kearny and the Hackensack River before coming into Jersey City.

This drive was a revealing experience. The road and much of the landscape was artificial, and yet it couldn't be called a work of art. On the other hand, it did something for me that art had never done. At first I didn't know what it was, but its effect was to liberate me from many of the views I had had about art.
