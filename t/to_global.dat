5|$|A Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution {{study in}} January 2009 found that emperor {{penguins}} could be {{pushed to the}} brink of extinction by the year 2100 due <b>to</b> <b>global</b> climate change. The study constructed a mathematical model to predict how the loss of sea ice from climate warming would affect a big colony of emperor penguins at Terre Adélie, Antarctica. The study forecasted an 87% decline in the colony's population, from three thousand breeding pairs in 2009 to four hundred breeding pairs in 2100.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the main}} common {{threats to the}} park are glacier retreat due <b>to</b> <b>global</b> warming; {{hydropower}} projects; legal and illegal mining operations with low environmental standards; and loss of biodiversity to agricultural land and pastures (the latter mainly due to a conflict between the park purposes and the ancestral rights to the land by the locals).|$|E

5|$|Divorce {{rates in}} Shanghai and Beijing, China's two most {{populated}} economic centres, have been steadily rising since 2005 with it reaching 30% in 2012.

5|$|Dramatic {{declines in}} {{amphibian}} populations, including population crashes and mass localized extinction, {{have been noted}} since the late 1980s from locations all over the world, and amphibian declines are thus perceived {{to be one of}} the most critical threats <b>to</b> <b>global</b> biodiversity. In 2004, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reported stating that currently birds, mammals, and amphibians extinction rates were at minimum 48 times greater than natural extinction rates—possibly 1,024 times higher.|$|E
5|$|Historian Wilson D. Miscamble {{argues that}} Kennan played a {{critical}} role in developing the foreign policies of the Truman administration. He also states that Kennan did not believe in either global or strongpoint containment; he simply wanted to restore the balance of power between the United States and the Soviets. Like historian John Lewis Gaddis, Miscamble concedes that although Kennan personally preferred political containment, his recommendations ultimately resulted in a policy directed more toward strongpoint than <b>to</b> <b>global</b> containment.|$|E

Commentators note that as recently as 2005, Key made statements indicating that he was sceptical of the effects and impact of climate change.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} {{contributors}} to globalization was the Triangular Trade and how it connected the world. The Triangular Trade or Triangle Trade was a system used to connect three {{areas of the world}} through trade. Once traded, items and goods were shipped {{to other parts of the}} world, making the triangle trade a key <b>to</b> <b>global</b> trade. The Triangle Trade system was run by Europeans, increasing their global power.|$|E

In the mid-1980s, the firm changed its business focus from currency and interest rate management <b>to</b> <b>global</b> bonds and currencies for institutional investors. As a fixed income and currency adviser to institutional clients, the company gained {{a reputation as a}} currency trader and a developer of techniques for overlying currencies. In 1990, it launched a hedge fund portfolio using monies from Kodak and Loews Corporation and began formally offering its currency overlay products to its clients.|$|E

Although its global population has not been quantified, it is assessed for the IUCN Red List as least concern for global extinction.|$|E
5|$|There are {{concerns}} raised about possible contribution from urban heat islands <b>to</b> <b>global</b> warming. Research on China indicates that urban heat island effect contributes to climate warming by about 30%. On the other hand, one 1999 comparison between {{urban and rural}} areas proposed that the urban heat island effects have little influence on global mean temperature trends. Many studies reveal increases in the severity of the effect with the progress of climate change.|$|E
