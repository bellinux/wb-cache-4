The day he landed in the Philippines, Groza saw a soldier shot in the face. He was stationed in a bank of tents about five miles from the front lines and helped doctors tend to the wounded.

500|$|Although {{each of the}} film's key puppets {{required}} a small team of puppeteers to operate it, the most complex puppet of the production was Hoggle. Shari Weiser was inside the costume, while Hoggle's face was radio-controlled by Brian Henson and three other operators. Speaking in the Inside the Labyrinth documentary, Brian Henson explained that Weiser [...] "does all the body movement and her head is inside the head. However, the jaw is not connected to her jaw. Nothing that the face is doing has any connection with what she's doing with her face. The other {{four members of the}} crew are all radio crew, myself included." [...] Speaking of the challenges involved with performing Hoggle, Brian Henson said, [...] "five performers trying to get one character out of one puppet was a very <b>tough</b> <b>thing.</b> Basically what it takes is a lot of rehearsing and getting to know each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Director Francis Lawrence said in 2008 {{that there}} would be a prequel and that Will Smith would be reprising his role. The plot of the film would reveal what {{happened}} to Neville before the infected took over New York. D. B. Weiss was hired to write the script, while Lawrence was in negotiations to return as director on the contingent that the story was interesting enough. Smith later discussed the premise, which would have his character and a team going from New York City to Washington, D.C., as they made their last stand against those infected with the virus. The film would again explore the premise of what it is like to be alone. Lawrence stated, [...] "... the <b>tough</b> <b>thing</b> is, how do we do that again and in a different way?" [...] In May 2011, Francis Lawrence stated that the prequel was no longer in development saying, [...] "I don't think that's ever going to happen." ...|$|E

Cantrell explained the reunion, [...] "We want to celebrate {{what we did}} {{and the memory of}} our friend. We have played with some [...] who can actually bring it and add their own thing to it without being a Layne clone. We're not interested in stepping on [...] rich legacy. It's a <b>tough</b> <b>thing</b> to go through. Do you take the Led Zeppelin approach and never play again, because the guy was that important? That's the approach we've taken for a lot of years. Or, do you give it a shot, try something? We're willing {{to take a chance on}} it. It's completely a reunion because the three of us who're left are back together. But it's not about separating and forgetting — it's about remembering and moving on."

500|$|On May 23, 2014, Marvel and Wright jointly {{announced}} that Wright {{was leaving the}} project due to [...] "differences in their vision of the film", and that the studio was closing in on a new director. On the split, Wright said, [...] "I {{wanted to make a}} Marvel movie but I don’t think they really wanted to make an Edgar Wright movie." [...] He also added that at one point, Marvel wanted to do a draft of the script without him, which was [...] "a <b>tough</b> <b>thing</b> to move forward" [...] as Wright has written all of the previous films he directed. Wright continued, [...] "Suddenly becoming a director-for-hire on it, you’re sort of less emotionally invested and you start to wonder why you’re there, really." [...] The majority of Wright's crew also left the project {{in the wake of his}} departure. By May 30, Adam McKay had entered negotiations to replace Wright, but pulled out of negotiations the next day.

500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN gave [...] "Now is Not the End" [...] a {{score of}} 8 out of 10, {{indicating}} a [...] "Great" [...] episode, and praised the titular character, who he thought was [...] "expertly played" [...] by Atwell, {{as well as her}} dynamic with D'Arcy's Jarvis. Goldman felt that the period setting was used well, despite the episode feeling [...] "like a TV show compared to the Marvel movies (being a TV show and all)", and was happy that series was attempting to [...] "entertain on its own merits", rather than try [...] "to add some huge important element to [...] giant overarching storyline". Goldman did feel that Carter needed a more specific villain to fight, but stated that [...] "With only eight episodes, that hopefully will change quickly". Alan Sepinwall at HitFix found that the series had learned from the mistakes of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and stood as its own entity. He praised Atwell's performance, the visual/period style, and D'Arcy as Jarvis, but he felt that Carter's sexist colleagues were cartoonish, saying [...] "not that sexism didn't exist in the era, but that it's a <b>tough</b> <b>thing</b> to dramatize from a modern perspective without feeling winky and smug. It's a dance many period dramas have to do, not always successfully, and while it would be foolish to pretend a woman like Peggy wouldn't have had to deal with these kinds of idiots all the time, Agent Carter is at its liveliest when the three stooges are nowhere to be seen".|$|E

2500|$|The {{involvement}} of cannabis {{in the creation}} of [...] "stoner rock/metal" [...] can range between bands in the genre. Bands such as Sleep have involved the concept of cannabis {{to be part of the}} core of their albums and songs. The consumption of cannabis is common in the live performances of some stoner rock/metal bands, and bands such as Electric Wizard are known to have concerts with the band members and the crowd participating in smoking cannabis. [...] Dopesmoker by Sleep received controversy because the 60-minute song is about cannabis, which resulted in conflict with Sleep's record company. While other members of the genre state that [...] "stoner rock is a style, not life," [...] which is interpreted as the band members do not participate in smoking cannabis or are influenced by cannabis, however the style of their music reflects the sound of [...] "stoner rock/metal." [...] Bands such as King Caravan and Sea of Green have come under terms with this statement. [...] Similarly, Matt Pike from the band [...] High on Fire stated, [...] "It's a very strong scene, but I don't think any of the stoner rock bands want to be labeled as stoner rock ... I might use the word 'stoner' in my lyrics, but I think we're metal, dude. I'd say I was crossover metal, actually, or progressive metal. It's kind of a <b>tough</b> <b>thing</b> to lump into a category, but I guess we get the stoner-rock label because of the whole pot thing." ...|$|E
