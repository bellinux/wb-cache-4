The extraglomerular mesangial cells are adjacent to the intraglomerular mesangial cells that are located inside the glomerulus and in between the capillaries.

Although histogenesis is well-documented, only {{a few studies have}} quantified cell numbers across normal human fetal brain growth. Due to the present lack of normative data it is difficult to gauge abnormal development. Furthermore, many studies of brain cell numbers have employed biased counting methods, whereas innovations in stereology during the past 20 – 30 years enable reliable and efficient estimates of cell numbers. However, estimates of cell volumes and densities in fetal brain samples are unreliable due to unpredictable shrinking artifacts, and the fragility of the fetal brain requires particular care in handling and processing.

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to clarify the effect of {{manipulating}} intratumor hypoxia on radiosensitivity under reduced dose-rate (RDR) irradiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tumor-bearing mice were continuously given 5 -bromo- 2 '-deoxyuridine (BrdU) to label all proliferating (P) cells. They received gamma-rays or accelerated carbon-ion beams at high dose-rate (HDR) or RDR with or without tumor clamping to induce hypoxia. Some mice without clamping received nicotinamide, an acute hypoxia-releasing agent or misonidazole, a hypoxic cell radio-sensitizer before irradiation. The responses of quiescent (Q) and total (= P + Q) cells were assessed by the micronucleus frequency using immunofluorescence staining for BrdU. RESULTS: The clearer decrease in radiosensitivity in Q than <b>total</b> <b>cells</b> after RDR gamma-ray irradiation was suppressed with carbon-ion beams, especially with a higher linear energy transfer value. Repressing the decrease in the radiosensitivity under RDR irradiation through keeping tumors hypoxic during irradiation and enhancing the decrease in the radiosensitivity by nicotinamide were clearer with gamma-rays and in <b>total</b> <b>cells</b> than with carbon-ion beams and in Q cells, respectively.

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the cellular profiles of induced sputum (IS) in patients with newly diagnosed HP to that of healthy subjects, and to examine the relationship between inflammatory cells from IS and BAL. Methods: Nine HP patients and 9 healthy volunteers were studied. IS was obtained by inhalation of hypertonic saline solution in all subjects. Bronchoscopy was performed on a different occasion in all patients and in five controls. Results: IS was well tolerated and preferred to BAL by all subjects. Both IS and BAL from HP patients showed a significant increase in <b>total</b> <b>cells</b> (P< 0. 02 and P< 0. 001) and in lymphocytes (P< 0. 02 and P< 0. 001) and a significant decrease in macrophages (P< 0. 05 and P< 0. 001), when compared with normal subjects. In HP patients, <b>total</b> <b>cells</b> number in IS was higher than that in BAL (P< 0. 02). Moreover, the percentage of lymphocytes was significantly lower in IS than in BAL (P< 0. 001). No significant relationship was found between <b>total</b> <b>cells</b> or inflammatory cells from IS and the corresponding ones from BAL and wide limits of agreement were found between lymphocytes from IS and BAL. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that both BAL and IS from newly diagnosed HP patients contained significantly more <b>total</b> <b>cells</b> and lymphocytes, when compared to healthy subjects. Moreover, differential cell counts in HP patients showed that IS and BAL reflected different compartments of inflammation. Thus, IS could represent a complementary, but not alternative tool to bronchoscopy both in research and in the clinical monitoring of HP patients...|$|E
