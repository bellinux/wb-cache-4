5|$|Similarly, {{after the}} victory the festival of the Agroteras Thysia ("sacrifice to the Agrotéra") {{was held at}} Agrae near Athens, in honor of Artemis Agrotera ("Artemis the Huntress"). This was in {{fulfillment}} of a vow made by the city before the battle, to offer in sacrifice a number of goats {{equal to that of}} the Persians slain in the conflict. <b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>was</b> so great, it was decided to offer 500 goats yearly until <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>was</b> filled. Xenophon notes that at his time, 90 years after the battle, goats were still offered yearly.|$|E
5|$|A Chief Justice of the King's Bench was {{assisted}} {{in his work}} {{by a number of}} Justices of the King's Bench. Occasionally appointed before 1272, the number fluctuated considerably between 1 and 4; from 1522, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>was</b> fixed at 3. Provisions for a fourth were established in 1830, and a fifth in 1868. Following the dissolution of the Court of King's Bench, the remaining Justices because Justices of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice. Justices were originally paid £26 a year, increasing to £66 in 1361, and £100 in 1389. An ordinance of 1645 increased this to £1,000, with the salary peaking at £5,500 in 1825. As with the Chief Justice, pension arrangements were formally organised in 1799, starting at £2,000 a year and peaking at £3,500 in 1825.|$|E

5|$|After the 1899 {{transfer}} {{of services to}} the Metropolitan Railway, the MR introduced a single Brown Marshall passenger carriage on the line; unlike other stations on the line, the platform height at Wood Siding was not raised {{at this time to}} accommodate the new carriage.

5|$|As part of Strasburg's {{rehabilitation}} {{from his}} Tommy John surgery, {{and as a}} precaution due to his low innings total in 2011, the Nationals decided {{to limit the number}} of innings Strasburg would throw in the 2012 season. Although <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>was</b> never official, rumors started that Strasburg's limit would be between 160 and 180 innings. It was also decided that Strasburg's shutdown would be final; he would not pitch in the playoffs. Dr. Lewis Yocum, the surgeon who operated on Strasburg's elbow, agreed in 2011 that Strasburg's 2012 innings total should be limited, although he did not consult with Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo or Strasburg during the season. Teammate Jordan Zimmermann underwent a similar process the year before.|$|E

M-76 was converted in stages into a freeway in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

5|$|In 1919, the Michigan State Highway Department signposted {{the highway}} {{system in the}} state for the first time.

5|$|In late 2014, Russia {{offered the}} Su-35 to Indonesia {{as the country}} sought to replace its ageing F-5E Tiger II fleet.

There were some initial reports that the country was to order a squadron of up to sixteen aircraft, but <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>was</b> later reduced to some ten aircraft.

5|$|On 13 November 1962, Tsarapkin {{indicated}} that the Soviet Union would accept a proposal drafted by US and Soviet experts involving automated test detection stations ("black boxes") and {{a limited number of}} on-site inspections. The two sides disagreed over the number of black boxes, however, as the US sought 12–20 such stations and the Soviet Union rejected any more than three. On 28 December 1962, Kennedy lowered the US demand to 8–10 stations. On 19 February 1963, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>was</b> lowered further to seven, as Khrushchev continued to insist on no more than three.
