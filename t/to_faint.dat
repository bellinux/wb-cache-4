5|$|At {{the time}} of the tornado, roughly 1,000 people lived in the hamlet of Chappaqua. Five homes and three barns were {{destroyed}} by the tornado and two people, 80-year-old Mrs. Mary Hibbs and an unknown woman, were killed; six additional people were injured. Orchards {{in the path of the}} tornado were completely destroyed and greenhouses were leveled. The severity of lightning during the storm caused many women <b>to</b> <b>faint</b> according to The New York Times.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Jakarta, an {{epidemic}} of the flu is underway. Among those who fall ill is President Sukarno, who writes to Chairman Mao Zedong to request some doctors. Mao sends doctors, who give Sukarno poison to paralyze him and aid the 30 September Movement in overthrowing the government. The slow acting poison causes Sukarno <b>to</b> <b>faint</b> after he and his ministers have a large party with haraam events, including the consumption of pork and frog and zina (sex outside of marriage).|$|E
5|$|The {{night before}} he is {{expected}} to leave for Hogwarts, Harry learns from Arthur Weasley that Sirius Black is a convicted murderer in the wizarding world, and he warns Harry that it is believed Black will attempt to murder Harry next. On the way to Hogwarts a Dementor boards the train, causing Harry <b>to</b> <b>faint.</b> Following the incident, Harry is helped by the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Remus Lupin.

5|$|The {{rings of}} Neptune, {{like those of}} Uranus, {{are thought to be}} {{relatively}} young; their age is probably significantly less than that of the Solar System. Also, like those of Uranus, Neptune's rings probably resulted from the collisional fragmentation of onetime inner moons. Such events create moonlet belts, which act as the sources of dust for the rings. In this respect the rings of Neptune are similar <b>to</b> <b>faint</b> dusty bands observed by Voyager 2 between the main rings of Uranus.|$|E

After {{deflecting}} Helen's interest by pretending to discuss bowling theory, Jacques asks Marge {{to meet him}} the next day away from the gossips of the world at his apartment, causing Marge <b>to</b> <b>faint.</b> In her dream, she imagines a romantic fantasy where she dances with Jacques in his luxurious, bowling-themed apartment. When she comes to, she accepts the invitation.|$|E
5|$|For {{the scene}} in which Ash is {{revealed}} to be an android, a puppet was created of the character's torso and upper body which was operated from underneath. During a preview screening of the film, this scene caused an usher <b>to</b> <b>faint.</b> In the following scene, Ash's head is placed on a table and re-activated; for portions of this scene, an animatronic head was made using a face cast of the actor, Ian Holm. However, the latex of the head shrank while curing {{and the result was}} not entirely convincing. For the bulk of the scene, Holm knelt under the table with his head coming up through a hole. Milk, caviar, pasta, fiber optics, and glass marbles were combined to form the android's innards.|$|E

5|$|The broad, heavily calcified {{jaws and}} nearly {{terminal}} mouth, combined with robust, serrated teeth, enable the tiger shark {{to take on}} these large prey. In addition, excellent eyesight and acute sense of smell enable it to react <b>to</b> <b>faint</b> traces of blood and follow them to the source. The ability to pick up low-frequency pressure waves enables the shark to advance towards an animal with confidence, even in murky water. The shark circles its prey and studies it by prodding it with its snout. When attacking, the shark often eats its prey whole, although larger prey are often eaten in gradual large bites and finished over time.|$|E
5|$|When {{the player}} {{encounters}} a wild Pokémon or is challenged by a trainer to a battle, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen where the Pokémon fight. During battle, the player may fight, use an item, switch the active Pokémon, or flee (the last {{is not an}} option in battles against trainers). Pokémon have hit points (HP), which is displayed during combat; when a Pokémon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and cannot battle unless taken to a Pokémon Center or healed or revived with a Pokémon skill or item. If the player's Pokémon defeats the opposing Pokémon (causes it <b>to</b> <b>faint),</b> it receives experience points. After accumulating enough experience points, it will level up; most Pokémon evolve into a new species of Pokémon when they reach a certain level, or when certain conditions are met (commonly, how much a Pokémon statistically 'likes' its trainer).|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} match, competitors Shawn Michaels and Rick Martel were unable, {{due to a}} pre-match stipulation, to hit {{each other in the}} face. The two men exchanged holds but were both preoccupied with looking to ringside for approval from Sensational Sherri. Martel gained the advantage by throwing Michaels to the outside of the ring and attacking him there. When the two returned to the ring, they took turns attempting to pin their opponent, pulling down their opponent's wrestling tights to reveal their buttocks each time. Michaels then kicked Martel and tried to pin him, but the referee stopped the three-count because Michaels' feet were on the ropes. Both wrestlers broke the pre-match stipulation by slapping each other in the face. Sherri pretended <b>to</b> <b>faint,</b> which drew the attention of both wrestlers. Michaels and Martel argued over who would carry Sherri backstage, with each man carrying her a few feet before being stopped by his opponent. Both wrestlers were counted out, but they continued to argue. Martel tried to revive Sherri by throwing water on her, but he hit Michaels as well. Michaels dropped Sherri and chased Martel backstage; upset at being left behind by both men, Sherri screamed and cried as she walked backstage.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the known}} {{residents}} of Quahog are invited to a dinner party in his palatial mansion by James Woods, who states {{he has become a}} born-again Christian thanks to his new girlfriend Priscilla, and wishes to repent for all his wrongdoings. Early into the night, as Woods and Priscilla go to the kitchen, Quagmire's new companion, Stephanie, is mysteriously shot when she sits in Woods's seat, leading the guests to believe Woods intends to murder them all. They try to leave, but lightning strikes a tree, causing it to break the bridge. Meanwhile, the main road is flooded due to the storm. Returning amidst accusations, Woods pleads ignorance before he too is murdered in front of the guests by an unseen killer with a knife during a power outage, causing Priscilla <b>to</b> <b>faint.</b> Trapped on the remote estate with no way of contacting anyone due to a thunderstorm, the guests realize that the killer is among them. They also discover that Stephanie's body has disappeared.|$|E
5|$|On March 20, 2011, Aerosmith {{announced}} a new greatest hits album, , which was released on May 10, 2011. On May 14, 2011, the band {{announced a}} tour of Latin America {{in the fall of}} 2011. In June, Joe Perry announced that the band is going to meet at the recording studio to produce the next album of the band in July. On August 30, it was announced that the new album will be released around May 2012. The album will be produced by Jack Douglas, who produced four albums for the band in the 1970s. Aerosmith began their fall tour of Latin America and Japan on October 22 in Lima, Peru. As part of the tour, the band performed in Paraguay, Panama, and Ecuador {{for the first time in}} their careers. Their show in Asunción, Paraguay was postponed a day, after lead singer Steven Tyler sustained facial injuries after falling in his hotel room shower, due to a bout of food poisoning that dehydrated him and caused him <b>to</b> <b>faint.</b>|$|E
5|$|The basic {{mechanics}} of Ruby and Sapphire are largely {{the same as}} their predecessors'. As with all Pokémon games for hand-held consoles, gameplay is in third-person, overhead perspective and consists of three basic screens: a field map, in which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and the menu, in which the player configures their party, items, or gameplay settings. The player begins the game with one Pokémon, and can capture more using Poké Balls. The player can also use their Pokémon to battle other Pokémon. When the player encounters a wild Pokémon or is challenged by a trainer to a battle, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen where the Pokémon fight. During battle, the player may fight, use an item, switch their active Pokémon, or flee (the last is not an option in battles against trainers).

5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) finds {{managing}} her household {{without her}} husband Jim (John Krasinski) {{to be more}} difficult than anticipated, as she struggles with duties such as taking out the trash. Her already frazzled condition worsens when she finds lice on her daughter CeCe, leaving her no choice but to wash all the clothing in the house. At work the next day, she notices Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) frantically scratching her head, and realizes she may have transferred the lice from CeCe to the office. She initiates an investigation and Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), who experienced lice infestations as a child in foster care, finds that all of the employees except Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate), Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) have lice. Given her disregard for cleanliness, the employees assume Meredith is responsible; Pam defends her but neglects to admit her guilt. To eliminate the lice, Meredith shaves her head. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) also overreacts, donning a hazmat suit and accidentally exposing himself to a hallucinogenic bug bomb that causes him <b>to</b> <b>faint.</b> On Erin's advice, the other infected employees pair up to put mayonnaise on each other's hair to suffocate the lice, which allows Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) and Erin to spend time together and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) to prank Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) in retaliation for his affair with her husband. Pam's mother calls to inform her that CeCe still has lice; the other staff overhear and realize Pam is responsible for the lice infestation, much to Meredith's delight.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon Diamond and Pearl are {{role-playing}} {{games with}} adventure elements. The basic {{mechanics of the}} games are largely {{the same as their}} predecessors. As with all Pokémon games for handheld consoles, gameplay is in third-person overhead perspective, and consists of three basic screens: a field map, in which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and the menu, in which the player configures his or her party, items, or gameplay settings. The player begins the game with no Pokémon or Poké Balls, but is given the choice of three Pokémon {{as a part of the}} story line. Once Pokéballs are obtained, the player can capture more Pokémon using Pokéballs. The player can also use his/her Pokémon to do damage to the other Pokémon. Whenever the player encounters a wild Pokémon or is challenged by a trainer to a battle, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen where the Pokémon fight. During battle, the player may fight, use an item, switch the active Pokémon, or flee (the last not an option in battles against trainers). All Pokémon have hit points (HP); whenever a Pokémon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and cannot battle unless revived at a Pokémon center or with an item. If the player's Pokémon defeats the opposing Pokémon (causes it <b>to</b> <b>faint),</b> it receives experience points. After accumulating enough experience points, it can level up; most Pokémon evolve into a new species of Pokémon whenever they reach a certain level. Pokémon's stats also increase every time it levels up, and they will also learn new moves as well. If the player cancels an evolution the Pokémon will learn new moves faster.|$|E

40|$|The color-magnitude {{relation}} (CMR) is {{a correlation}} between the colors and absolute magnitudes of early-type galaxies that displays a progressive reddening of the integrated colors of galaxies with increasing luminosity or mass. By studying the CMRs of galaxy clusters, information about the evolution, kinematics and star-formation histories of cluster galaxies can be inferred. Important characteristics of the CMRs for early-type galaxies include the linearity of the relation, the scatter, and variations in the CMR among different clusters (characterized by uniformity in mean color, slope and intrinsic scatter). Here we present {{a study of the}} Coma cluster CMR with greater precision and <b>to</b> <b>fainter</b> magnitudes than has previously been possible. We investigate whether the linearity and scatter of the relation persists <b>to</b> <b>fainter</b> magnitudes, the results of which may yield limits on models of galaxy formation and evolution within the Coma cluster...|$|R
