5|$|Through the series, {{the cities}} used within <b>the</b> <b>Crazy</b> Taxi games have been {{influenced}} by real-world cities, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, and Las Vegas. Certain versions of <b>the</b> <b>Crazy</b> Taxi game include in-game counterparts of real-world businesses, including Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, FILA, and Tower Records; these were often destination targets for the passengers. Although {{this is one of the}} most prominent examples of product placement in video gaming history, it is generally looked upon relatively favorably amongst gamers, perhaps because it gives a sense of realism to the fictional cities in the game. These establishments have been replaced with generic businesses in later games due to licensing difficulties.|$|E

Bootleg copies of Donkey Kong also appeared in both North America and France under <b>the</b> <b>Crazy</b> Kong, Konkey Kong or Donkey King names. The 1982 Logger arcade game from Century Electronics is a direct clone of Donkey Kong, with a large bird standing in for the ape and rolling logs instead of barrels.|$|E

The arcade and initial home console versions include selections from punk rock bands The Offspring and Bad Religion, though {{these have been}} removed in both the Game Boy Advance and the PlayStation Portable remakes because of licensing issues.

5|$|After {{covering}} up a murder that occurred at <b>The</b> <b>Crazy</b> Horse, Adriana is arrested and pressured by the FBI {{to wear a}} wire to avoid being charged as an accomplice. She refuses to wear a wire and informs the FBI that she {{may be able to}} persuade her fiancé Christopher to co-operate and become an informant against Tony. She confesses to Christopher that she has been informing and that the FBI would give them new identities if they would testify. Christopher is grief-stricken and nearly kills her. He leaves the apartment, saying he needs time to think. Tony has Silvio pick up Adriana under the pretense of taking her to see Christopher, but instead drives her out to the woods and executes her. Adriana’s betrayal and subsequent execution is too much for Christopher to handle and he briefly returns to drug abuse to deal with the pain.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the bands}} that {{regularly}} played the university, including Cream, Jimi Hendrix, and Pink Floyd, they were particularly impressed by <b>The</b> <b>Crazy</b> World of Arthur Brown, and recruited an organist, Nick Pearne, {{to match the}} format of Arthur Brown's band. Along with two female dancers, the initial line-up was Hammill on guitar and vocals, Smith on drums, wind instruments and vocals, and Pearne on organ (though he did not initially have an instrument). According to Smith, the band initially played as a two-piece, with Smith occasionally using a typewriter as a percussion instrument; their first gig as a three-piece was in the student union, which lasted five minutes before the group's amplifiers blew up.|$|E

In an article about <b>the</b> <b>Crazies</b> published in 2007, Al Featherston stated, [...] "Duke's crowd may or may not be the best student section… but it is the standard by which all others are measured".
