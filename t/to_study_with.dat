5|$|In 1844, American {{ballerina}} Mary Ann Lee {{arrived in}} Paris <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>with</b> Coralli for a year. She {{returned to the}} United States in 1841 with the directions for Giselle and other ballets. Lee {{was the first to}} present Giselle in the United States. She did this on 1 January 1846 in Boston at the Howard Athenæum. George Washington Smith played Albrecht. Lee danced Giselle (again with Smith) on 13 April 1846 at the Park Theatre in New York City.|$|E
5|$|One day, Chia-yi forgets her English textbook. Ching-teng slips her his {{own book}} and tells their teacher he forgot his own textbook; he then endures a long lecture and is punished. Chia-yi, touched by Ching-teng's generosity, prepares a {{practice}} exam {{for him in}} return, to encourage him to study. She also convinces him to stay after school <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>with</b> her. Their relationship grows, and Ching-teng's grades gradually improve.|$|E
5|$|Zoghby {{related in}} Memoires that he first {{received}} a vocational call at age sixteen. With his parent's blessing {{he left for}} seminary {{in the summer of}} 1928, going to Jerusalem <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>with</b> the White Fathers at the Melkite seminary of Saint Anne. He was ordained a priest at Saint Anne Melkite Basilica in Jerusalem on July 20, 1936, following which he was appointed a professor of Arabic Literature and Mathematics at the seminary. He later returned to Cairo as a parish priest.|$|E

50|$|Prior <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> <b>with</b> Kokkonen, Salmenhaara {{had already}} written several tonal pieces, {{including}} the 17 Small Pieces for Piano (1957-1960). In the early 1960s, he {{was associated with}} the modernist Finnish Musical Youth.|$|R
5|$|After World War 2, William Marbury, then Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Peabody Institute, {{began the}} process of {{integrating}} that institution, which had denied entrance to several well-regarded African American performers based solely on their race, including Anne Brown and Todd Duncan, {{who had been the}} first black performer with the New York City Opera when he was forced <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>with</b> Frank Bibb, a member of the Peabody faculty, outside the Conservatory. The director of the Peabody soon ended segregation, both at the Conservatory and at the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, which was conducted by its first African American, A. Jack Thomas, at his request. The Peabody was officially integrated in 1949, with support from mayor Howard W. Jackson. Paul A. Brent, who graduated in 1953, was the first to matriculate, and was followed by Audrey Cyrus McCallum, who was the first to enter the Peabody Preparatory. Musical integration was a gradual process that lasted until at least 1966, when the unions for African American and white musicians merged to form the Musicians' Association of Metropolitan Baltimore. Baltimore is the hometown of African American classical opera tenor Steven Cole.|$|E
5|$|Despite Gray {{constantly}} seeking {{collectors and}} {{people to help}} him with the Harvard herbarium, in the first fifteen years he was at Harvard, no graduate entered botany as a career. This changed in 1858 with the arrival of Daniel Cady Eaton, who had graduated from Yale University in 1857 and came to Harvard <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>with</b> Gray. Eaton later returned to Yale to be a botany professor and oversee its herbarium, just as Gray did at Harvard. Daniel Eaton was the grandson of Amos Eaton, whose textbooks Gray had studied during his college days. Eaton influenced the teaching style of Gray, and both required practical work of their students. Gray retained the Fisher post until 1873 while living in the Asa Gray House.|$|E
5|$|Hsu was {{reportedly}} born on 7 July 1898, in Shantou prefecture of China, {{during the reign}} of the Manchu Qing dynasty, although this has never been independently verified. When Hsu was young, her father walked out on the family for another woman. Her mother, who was illiterate, had to fend for the three girls and one brother singlehandedly. At 16, her family moved to Penang in Malaya, where they worked as cleaners in a convent. As {{she did not want to}} be a cleaner all her life, Hsu asked the nuns there to allow her <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>with</b> the children, and they agreed. Combining study with work, she passed her Senior Cambridge examinations four years later. Equipped with a basic education, she ventured to Hong Kong to work and, later, to Chongqing, China, where she became a secretary and bookkeeper at a German news agency in the 1930s. She quit her job to become a volunteer, helping the injured during the Sino-Japanese War.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, she left Blackpool, and moved south to London. Her reasons {{for doing so}} have never been satisfactorily explained, and she would offer multiple, {{contradictory}} accounts of her reasoning in later life. According to one account, her father sent her <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>with</b> the famed occultist and mystic Aleister Crowley, who had founded the religion of Thelema in 1904; Montalban's biographer Julia Philips noted that while she met Crowley in London, this story remains implausible. Another of Montalban's accounts held that {{she moved to the}} capital to work for the Daily Express newspaper; this claim has never been corroborated, and one of the paper's reporters at the time, Justine Glass, has claimed that she never remembered Montalban working there. Montalban often changed her stories, and informed later disciple Michael Howard that upon arrival in London, the Daily Express sent her to interview Crowley. According to this story, when she first visited him at his lodgings in Jermyn Street, he was suffering from an asthma attack, and having had experience with this ailment from a family member she was able to help him, earning his gratitude. They subsequently went to the expensive Café Royal in Regent Street, where after their lunch, he revealed that he was unable to pay, leaving Montalban to sort out payment.|$|E
5|$|Neptune is {{not visible}} to the unaided eye {{and is the only}} planet in the Solar System found by {{mathematical}} prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining known 13 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>with</b> Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989. The advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed observations from afar.|$|E
5|$|The Mysore Zoo, {{established}} in 1892, the Karanji, Kukkarahalli and the Blue Lagoon Lake are popular recreational destinations. Blue Lagoon {{which is a}} lake with a mini island is located behind KRS water Dam {{and it is very}} mesmerising to be there and watch the sunset and sunrise. The colour of the water and the sky is Blue and there is a mini island in the middle due to which it was named as Blue Lagoon. Mysuru has the Regional Museum of Natural History, the Folk Lore Museum, the Railway Museum and the Oriental Research Institute. The city is a centre for yoga-related health tourism that attracts domestic and foreign visitors, particularly those who, for years, came <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>with</b> the late ashtanga yoga guru K.

5|$|Luang Pu Sodh {{was born}} as Sodh Mikaewnoi on 10 October 1884 to a {{relatively}} well-off family of rice merchants in Amphoe Song Phi Nong, Suphan Buri, a province 102km west of Bangkok in central Thailand. His father was called Ngen and his mother Soodjai. He received part of his schooling in the temple of his uncle, a Buddhist monk, when he was nine years old. He therefore became familiar with Buddhism from an early age. He also showed qualities of being an intelligent autodidact. When Sodh's uncle moved to Wat Hua Bho, he took Sodh with him to teach him further. After a while his uncle left the monkhood, but Ngen managed to send Sodh <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>with</b> Luang Por Sub, the abbot of Wat Bangpla. This is where Sodh learnt the Khmer language. When he was thirteen years old, he finished his Khmer studies there and returned home to help his father. Father Ngen ran a rice-trading business, shipping rice from Suphanburi to sell to rice mills in Bangkok and Nakhon Chai Si District. At the age of fourteen, Ngen died, {{and he had to}} take responsibility for the family business, being the first son. This had an impact on him: thieves and other threats brought home to him the futility of the household life, and at the age of eighteen, he desired to be ordained as a monk. He had to take care of his family first though, and saved up money for them to be able to leave behind after he would become a monk. The biography of Wat Phra Dhammakaya says that he had to calculate the rate of inflation for this, and work harder than before, but finally managed to gather enough funds after four years.|$|E
