50|$|Along {{with the}} {{multiplication}} of torque, {{there is a}} decrease in rotational speed of the output shaft compared to the input shaft. This decrease in speed is inversely proportional {{to the increase in}} torque. For example, a torque multiplier with a rating of 3:1 will turn its output shaft with three times the torque, but at one third the speed, of the input shaft. However, due to friction and other inefficiencies in the mechanism, the output torque is slightly lower than the <b>theoretical</b> <b>output.</b>|$|E
