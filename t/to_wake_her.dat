25|$|At {{the home}} of the landlord, Xi'er is forced to work day and night as a slave and is exhausted. Zhang Ershen (literally Second Aunt Zhang), an elderly maid of the landlord, is very {{sympathetic}} of Xi'er. Xi'er dozes off while trying to take a short break. The mother of the landlord comes on the scene and, with her hairpin, pokes Xi'er's face <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>her</b> up. The landlord mother then orders Xi'er to prepare her a lotus seed soup. When the soup is served, the landlord mother, displeased with the taste, pours the still-boiling soup on Xi'er's face. Outraged by the pain and anger, Xi'er picks up the whip that the landlord uses to punish her, and beats up the landlord mother. The landlord mother falls and crawls on the floor attempting to flee while Xi'er continues to whip her with her utmost strength. Xi'er gets her vengeance, but she is subsequently locked up by the landlord.|$|E

25|$|Many years ago, in the Enchanted Forest, a young Regina {{wishes that}} her mother Cora {{had more time to}} play. Without her mother {{watching}} her, Regina finds a magic wand and attempts to transform her doll into a real sister with whom to play, only to have the spell backfire, knocking her unconscious. Cora and Prince Henry realizes {{that the only way to}} save her is by bringing a magical family member <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>her</b> up. Consequently, Cora visits Oz to bring back Zelena, who just used her magic to restock the logs she dropped. This angers her abusive adoptive father, who doesn't want Zelena to use her “wicked” magic. Cora immediately freezes the woodcutter as he is about to hit her (her adoptive mother wasn't around to protect Zelena this time), then gives Zelena the opportunity to prove that her magic can be used for good, which she accepts. As Zelena is able to wake Regina, the two are unaware of their being sisters at first, but over time become close, and quickly realize that they're related, when Zelena accidentally opens Cora's wand box, leading to Cora admitting that Regina and Zelena are sisters. Despite Regina's pleas to have Zelena in her life, Cora, believing that Zelena's presence will interfere with Regina's future of becoming the next queen, wipes both of their memories and sends Zelena back to Oz.|$|E
25|$|At Granny's, Regina is in {{mourning}} during a wake for Robin. Snow and David {{are ready to}} console Regina and even Zelena is ready to reach out {{each other in the}} wake of her loss to Hades. Violet also pays respects to Robin as she tells Henry she was worried about him {{while he was in the}} Underworld. At the Clock tower, Gold is looking for another way to wake up Belle, and begins to look at the Olympian Crystal, which he'll use to tether all the magic from Storybrooke. Gold holds the crystal and it glows. Back at the Diner, Emma wants to talk to Regina but suddenly they hear a noise, and witnesses a series of beams shooting outside from the Olympian Crystal. All of a sudden Hook shows up as Emma tells Regina about his return. Realizing that Gold is behind it, everyone traces the disturbance to the tower; Emma and Regina figure out that Gold couldn't wake Belle with True Love's kiss since she doesn't love him anymore, so he stole Storybrooke's magic as part of a plan <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>her.</b> Emma tells Regina to let her and the others handle this one, leading to the two bickering until Henry stops them, but after Regina disappears, Emma tells Henry to leave as well, only to meet up with Violet at the Pawn Shop. Henry is upset over how magic has destroyed his family and sees it as bad, so he comes up with a solution by creating a plan called “Operation Mixtape.” Utilizing his role as the Author, Henry uses the quill to writes himself as the possessor of the crystal, and suddenly, it appears in his hand. He sends both mothers a text, detailing his plans.|$|E

The three eventually catch the train, but it is halted when Riley falls asleep. They succeed in manipulating Riley's dreams <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>her</b> and restart the train, but it is derailed when the [...] "Honesty Island" [...] collapses (when Riley steals her mother's credit card and begins to run away). In desperation, Joy tries to ride a [...] "recall tube" [...] back to Headquarters, but abandons Sadness since close proximity to Sadness will cause the core memories to turn sad, which Joy believes will hurt Riley. But as she takes off, the ground below the tube collapses, breaking the tube and plunging Joy and Bing Bong into the Memory Dump. At the bottom, Joy then begins to lose hope and breaks into tears and cries, but discovers a sad memory of a ice hockey game that became happy when Riley's parents and friends comforted her. Joy realizes that Sadness serves an important purpose: to create empathy in others when Riley is emotionally overwhelmed and needs help.|$|E
500|$|Part IV {{consists}} {{of only one}} chapter, which, like the book's opening chapter, is mostly composed {{of a series of}} seemingly unrelated vignettes. After an opening call for dawn to break, the remainder of the chapter {{consists of}} the vignettes [...] "Saint Kevin", [...] "Berkely and Patrick" [...] and [...] "The Revered Letter". ALP is given the final word, as the book closes on a version of her Letter and her final long monologue, in which she tries <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>her</b> sleeping husband, declaring [...] "Rise up, man of the hooths, you have slept so long!", and remembers a walk they once took, and hopes for its re-occurrence. At the close of her monologue, ALP – as the river Liffey – disappears at dawn into the ocean. The book's last words are a fragment, but they can be turned into a complete sentence by attaching them to the words that start the book: A way a lone a last a loved a long the / riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs.|$|E

He starts disregarding his musical obligations as he spends more time with Heer, and soon Khatana asks Heer to persuade Jordan to attend his concerts. Heer accompanies him to a show, and the media links them as a couple, portraying her as having an affair despite being married. Heer asks Jordan to complete his tour and reunite with her once again. After JJ finishes his performances, both will have some intimate time. During this time, her condition worsens. She slowly slips into a coma and is discovered by their doctor to be pregnant; Neena and Mandy guess it is because of Jordan. Mandy calls him and tells that Heer is pregnant but has gone into a coma.

500|$|One day, the {{adolescent}} Tubman {{was sent to}} a dry-goods store for supplies. There, she encountered a slave owned by another family, who had left the fields without permission. His overseer, furious, demanded that she help restrain him. She refused, and as he ran away, the overseer threw a two-pound weight at him. He struck her instead, which she said [...] "broke my skull." [...] She later explained her belief that her hair – which [...] "had never been combed and...stood out like a bushel basket" [...] – might have saved her life. Bleeding and unconscious, she was returned to her owner's house and laid on the seat of a loom, where she remained without medical care for two days. She was sent back into the fields, [...] "with blood and sweat rolling down my face until I couldn't see." [...] Her boss said she was [...] "not worth a sixpence" [...] and returned her to Brodess, who tried unsuccessfully to sell her. She began having seizures and would seemingly fall unconscious, although she claimed to be aware of her surroundings while appearing to be asleep. These episodes were alarming to her family, who were unable <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>her</b> when she fell asleep suddenly and without warning. This condition remained with her {{for the rest of her}} life; Larson suggests she may have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy as a result of the injury.|$|E

In the episode [...] "Henchman", Marceline tricks Finn into becoming her accomplice, but Finn soon discovers {{that she is not}} evil, but rather fond of mischief and pranks, and the two develop a friendship. In the second season premiere [...] "It Came From the Nightosphere", Abadeer is accidentally summoned to Ooo by Finn. While Abadeer ravages the land, Finn discovers that there is animosity between Marceline and her father. Finn manages to distract Abadeer by playing a recording of Marceline's [...] "Fry Song", which leads to a brief moment of reconciliation between the two before Finn sends him back to the Nightosphere. In the third season episode [...] "Memory of a Memory", Ash attempts to rekindle his former relationship with Marceline via trickery. Disguised as Marceline's [...] "spirit animal", he tricks Finn and Jake into believing that Marceline has fallen asleep due to a sleep spell that has been self-inflicted. Following Ash's advice, the two enter into Marceline's mind to retrieve the [...] "memory core" [...] in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>her</b> up. Along the way, they encounter various memories of her as a child {{in the aftermath of the}} Mushroom War. However, the duo soon learn that it was an elaborate trick by Ash; Finn and Jake actually removed Marceline's memory of their break-up. In the end, Finn is able to convince Marceline, and she promptly attacks her chauvinistic ex-boyfriend. In [...] "What Was Missing", past animosity between Marceline and Princess Bubblegum is explored when Finn, Jake, Princess Bubblegum, BMO, and Marceline form a band in order to defeat the Door Lord and recover what was stolen from them.|$|E

2500|$|Erik Wolpaw and Jay Pinkerton {{were mainly}} {{responsible}} for the single player campaign's story, while Chet Faliszek focused on the lines for GLaDOS in the cooperative campaign. Portal 2 was originally not intended to feature GLaDOS or Chell, the player-character from Portal. However, the demand {{for all of these}} to be implemented into Portal 2 was great enough that they chose to do so. Originally, the character Cave Johnson was intended to be the antagonist instead and Portal 2 to be a prequel. Before implementing Chell, they considered introducing a new player-character who would at one point inadvertently reactivate GLaDOS. During play testing, Wolpaw found that there were two groups that were [...] "at-odds": one group was excited to see GLaDOS return, while the other did not want <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>her</b> up and questioned why players would want to do that. As such, the character Wheatley was introduced, who inadvertently wakes GLaDOS while trying to escape the facilities with Chell. Wheatley and GLaDOS served as a contrasts to each other; where GLaDOS has a more [...] "computery-sounding" [...] voice due to her intelligence, Wheatley [...] "sounded perfectly human" [...] due to his lack of it. Play testers were also bothered {{by the fact that the}} new protagonist was not recognized by GLaDOS when she awoke; as such, they changed the new character back into Chell. Wolpaw and the designers were not sure what to do with GLaDOS and were wary to do the same thing as the last game. They felt that she should [...] "go someplace" [...] and that since GLaDOS is [...] "kind of likeable in the first game" [...] and players [...] "enjoy being with her", they would utilize Wheatley as an [...] "other, external threat". In the early part of the game, GLaDOS introduces each chamber and congratulates the player on completing it; though they could have included intermediate dialog from GLaDOS while the player attempts to solve each chamber, they found this would be distracting to players and limited her presence in the game to only these points.|$|E
