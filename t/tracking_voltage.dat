The value indicates the minimum DC voltage {{that is required}} {{in order for the}} inverter to turn on and begin operation. This is especially important for solar applications, because the system designer must be sure that there is a sufficient number of solar modules wired in series in each string to produce this voltage.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. The rising {{worldwide}} {{popularity of}} HVDC applications for power transmission purposes increases {{the need to}} study the performance of commonly used insulation materials when exposed to this voltage type. The {{aim of this study}} is thus to compare several insulation materials according to their resistance to erosion and tracking when exposed to surface discharges of HVAC and HVDC voltages of both polarities. The materials are tested according to the Incline Plane Test method described in the IEC 60587 standard, using a test voltage of 4. 0 kV (rms). An important aspect of this project is the development of a bipolar DC source capable of delivering the required test voltage and current for both positive and negative polarities, while performing in accordance with the specifications set down in the standard. The design is intentionally kept modular {{in order to make it}} adaptable for future installations. Since the standard describes two different test methods, i. e. the constant <b>tracking</b> <b>voltage</b> method and the stepwise <b>tracking</b> <b>voltage</b> method, a comparison is done between the two methods in order to determine which one delivers best results for the test samples. The comparison shows that the methods deliver comparable results, but the constant <b>tracking</b> <b>voltage</b> method is preferred due to its superior test procedure. Finally, four different polymer insulator materials are tested and successfully compared under the effects of HVAC and HVDC of both polarities. The test materials include a RTV silicone rubber coated ceramic, two different HTV silicone rubbers and an EPDM rubber. The comparison is done according to the results obtained for a number of evaluation criteria. The results show that the RTV silicone rubber coating exhibits the least erosion for an AC voltage, but shows extensive erosion for a negative DC voltage. The HTV silicone rubbers exhibit only minimal erosion when exposed to an AC test voltage, but develop strong erosion under a positive DC voltage which can result in sample failure. The EPDM experiences its least erosion for a negative DC voltage, but shows maximum erosion severity for the AC voltage...|$|E

30|$|The {{adaptive}} FRT {{control strategy}} has {{little impact on}} the operation of GSC of DFIGs. Firstly, only the voltage amplitude drops under the grid fault, while the voltage phase angle is stable. Moreover, the phase tracking of PLL is accurate. Therefore, the traditional control strategy of GSC can meet the requirements. Secondly, when the voltage phase angle jumps under the grid fault, the traditional control strategy of GSC has been adopted. There is a phase deviation between actual reference frame and measured reference frame given by <b>tracking</b> <b>voltage</b> phase through PLL. However, the operation effect of GSC is small, which can be neglected. The reasons can be summarized as: ① The converter capacity is smaller than that of DFIGs, thus {{there is a little}} impact of control strategy of GSC on power grid. ② The FRT control of DFIGs is implemented mainly through improving control strategy of RSC. Therefore the transient output characteristics of DFIGs are almost not affected by the control strategy of GSC. ③ The functions of control strategy of RSC are to keep the stability of DC capacitor voltage and to control the reactive power exchange between GSC and power grid. The reactive power exchange is usually zero. At the same time, a slight fluctuation of DC capacitor voltage is allowed during the grid fault, and the chopper protection circuit can ensure the safety of DC capacitor.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this work, an {{automatic}} solar insolation tracking system {{was designed and}} constructed primarily {{for the purpose of}} optimizing solar energy collection by solar payloads. This was achieved through hardware/software-embedded programme control system. A programmable Microcontroller (PIC 16 F 873 A), Light Detection Sensor (CdS NORP 12 -RS) and a Stepper Motor (Sanyo Denki G- 05 S) were used. MPLAB IDE compiler for microchip was used to programme the PIC 16 F 873 A. The implemented programme enables the PIC 16 F 873 A to analyze solar intensities sensed by the CdS NORP 12 -RS and relays tracking instructions to the stepper motor to produce a torque on payload in the direction favourable to maximum solar intensity. The maximum output voltage of 2. 49 V was measured from the sensor under bright illumination while the minimum output of 1. 83 V was obtained under zero illumination. However, the calculated values show a maximum output voltage of 4. 90 V under bright illumination and a minimum output of 0. 84 V under zero illumination. The binary resolution corresponding to the higher threshold voltage of 2. 49 V was determined as 011111112 while that for the lower threshold voltage of 1. 83 V was 010111012. The microcontroller uses these threshold values as <b>tracking</b> <b>voltage</b> reference values for the Cadmium-Sulphide (CdS NORP 12 -RS) photoresistors. The stepper motor with factory stepping angle of 1. 8 o was half-stepped to 0. 9 o to produce smaller rotations and precise positioning of payloads.

40|$|The {{estimation}} of voltage/current phasors and local frequency are key parts to operate {{and control the}} ever evolving electricity networks. Phasor and frequency can be estimated by using numerical optimisation techniques. These techniques offer the flexibility to handle frequency variations, disturbances, and fault conditions more effectively {{when compared with the}} commonly used digital techniques such as fast Fourier transform (FFT) and discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Although numerical techniques such as Kalman filter (KF), Newton-type algorithm (NTA), recursive-least-squares (RLS), and least-squares (LS) rectify the shortcomings of FFT and DFT techniques, their immense computational burden and stability issues impede their real-time application. Adaptive notch filter (ANF) and enhanced phase-locked loop (EPLL) benefit from simple structures although their performance degrade under severe unbalance and fault conditions. The objective of this thesis is to propose the application of new numerical optimisation techniques as real-time estimation tools for power system phasors, harmonics, and frequency. The contributions of this research work are as follows: &# 61656;	The LS technique is modified to deliver frequency adaptive estimate of voltage envelope. &# 61656;	A new decoupled recursive-least-squares (DRLS) technique is presented for harmonics and phasor estimation. &# 61656;	A modified gradient search (MGS) undersampling technique for harmonics/interharmonics and phasor estimation is presented which shows comparable accuracy with that of the recommended technique by IEC Standard 61000 - 4 - 7. &# 61656;	A new Newton-type-algorithm and least-squares (NTA-LS) frequency estimation technique is presented. MATLAB software has been used to emulate harmonics, frequency variation, and fault conditions in a computer environment. Programmable power supplies have been used to conduct experiments in the laboratory. Two widely available research & development digital signal processor (DSP) controllers have been used for real-time phasor and frequency estimation in the experiments. Simulation studies and real-time experiments have been performed and results presented in this thesis support the following observations. &# 61656;	The proposed LS technique shows better performance in <b>tracking</b> <b>voltage</b> envelope and frequency variations when compared with the ANF and EPLL techniques. The proposed new least-squares-Kalman (LSK) estimation technique shows better accuracy than the DFT technique in <b>tracking</b> <b>voltage</b> flicker patterns. &# 61656;	The DRLS technique shows considerable improvement in terms of reducing the computational burden of the conventional RLS technique for real-time implementation on DSPs. The computational efficiency of the DRLS technique is also better than that of the DFT and adaptive linear combiner (ADALINE) techniques for extracting phasors and harmonics under highly harmonic distorted power system environments. The DRLS technique also shows a higher level of accuracy and stability to track synchronized phasors under fault conditions when compared with the EPLL technique. &# 61656;	The simplicity of the proposed undersampling MGS technique is promising for analysing the voltage and current spectra in real-time on the simple hardware platforms at a low sampling frequency. This thesis also proposes an extension of the staggered undersampling to reduce the estimation delays associated with the staggered undersampling. The presented extension on the undersampling concept lays the basis of wide-area-measurement systems (WAMs) implementation at the distribution level based on what the residential area broadband internet services can already offer. The proposed technique of direct transfer of data over the communication network is more reliable than the global positioning system (GPS) based synchrophasor detection and bypasses the DSP clock synchronization errors. &# 61656;	The NTA-LS technique demonstrates faster estimation pace, higher accuracy and better noise immunity for implementation at low sampling frequency in comparison with the PLL and DFT-based decomposition of single-phase into orthogonal components (DSPOC) techniques. The stability of the proposed modified NTA-LS technique is also superior to that of the conventional NTA. This work lays the basis for using new numerical optimisation techniques for real-time parameter estimation in power systems and studying the electric load based on slow sampling observations...|$|E
