40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{an essay}} collection by Marek Bieńczyk, "Przeźroczystość"[Transparency]. The concept, placed in various context, shows various aspects and {{is seen in}} various shades. The author does not put forward a statement, but rather proposes a work to be done: to determine the modality of transparency. The concept initially seems to be mainly epistemological: the cognizant subject {{would like to make}} the world transparent, to discover all possible mysteries. Before that, however, the subject must know itself, and here the dream of transparency also plays the key role. Lack of epistemological transparency is the main cause of melancholy and its reverse — hysteria. The concept turns out to be important in the domain of love — the loer thinks <b>that</b> (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> knows the desired person more better anybody else, <b>that</b> (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> has entirely penetrated the subjectivity of the Other. Ultimately, however, the dream of transparency goes down to a slow demise of the subject: as self-discovery progresses, there is less and less of the discoverer. In conclusion of this work, the border of modality of the concept turns out to be horrifyingly obvious. The desire for transparency consequently searches not for knowledge, but for an escape whose name is death. 21239252 Poznańskie Studia Polonistyczne. Seria Literack...|$|R

These findings uggest <b>that</b> <b>he</b> 38 <b>S</b> and 33 S species represent products of the transcription f non-defective virion RNAs. Kinetic analyses of RNA synthesis ndicated that during a I min pulse more radioactivity was associated with the 38 S than with the 49 S RNA and as the length of the pulse increased, the ratio of 38 S/ 49 S decreased, with the 49 S appearing as the pre-dominant species. Furthermore, addition of cycloheximide within the first 3 h p. i. resulted in detection of only the 49 S species. Synthesis of all four species was unaffected when the drug was added after this time period. These data suggest that the 38 S species may represent newly synthesized 49 S molecules and some protein(s) synthesized within the first 3 h p. i. is necessary fo maintaining the 38 S conformational form...|$|R

40|$|Coronaviruses {{assemble}} {{and obtain}} their envelope at membranes of the intermediate compartment between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex. Like other enveloped viruses, coronavirus assembly is presumably dependent on protein localization and protein-protein {{as well as}} protein-RNA interactions. We have used the bovine coronavirus (BCV) as a model to study interactions between the viral proteins in virus-infected cells that are important for coronavirus assembly. BCV is a prototype for the coronaviruses that express an additional major structural protein, the hemagglutinin esterase (HE), {{in addition to the}} spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M) glycoprotein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein. Complexes consisting of the M, <b>S,</b> and <b>HE</b> proteins were detected in virus-infected cells by coimmunoprecipitations. Kinetic analyses demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>S</b> protein and <b>HE</b> each quickly formed a complex with M protein after synthesis, whereas heterocomplexes consisting of all three proteins formed more slowly. The kinetics of <b>HE</b> biosynthesis revealed <b>that</b> the half-life of oligomerization was approximately 30 min, which correlated with the appearance of complexes consisting of M, <b>HE,</b> and <b>S</b> proteins, suggesting that oligomerization and/or conformational changes may be important for the S-M-HE protein complexes to form. Only HE dimers were found associated with the heterocomplexes consisting of all three proteins. S-M-HE protein complexes were detected prior to processing of the oligosaccharide chains on <b>HE,</b> indicating <b>that</b> these protein complexes formed in a premedial Golgi compartment before trimming of sugar chains. Transient coexpressions and double-labeling immunofluorescence demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>HE</b> and <b>S</b> proteins colocalized with M protein. This was further supported by coimmunoprecipitation of specific HE-M and S-M protein complexes from transfected cells, indicating that these proteins can form complexes in the absence of other viral proteins...|$|R
