5|$|The Bosnian Muslims' {{dissatisfaction with}} the Ustaše rule of the NDH and <b>their</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> {{protection}} were combined with nostalgia {{for the period of}} Habsburg rule in Bosnia and a generally friendly attitude towards Germany among prominent Bosnian Muslims. These factors led to a push towards autonomy for the Bosnian Muslim community which was strongly opposed by Pavelić as counter to the territorial integrity of the NDH. By November 1942, the autonomists were desperate to protect the Muslim people and wrote to Adolf Hitler asking that he annex Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Reich.|$|E
5|$|The two Brummer class cruisers were {{designed}} in 1914, when the turbines being built by AG Vulcan for the Russian battlecruiser Navarin became available {{owing to the}} state of war between Germany and Russia. The German navy instructed AG Vulcan to divide the turbines in half and design a pair of cruiser-minelayers around the propulsion system. As a result of <b>their</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> high speed, they were lightly armed, with only four 15cm guns. And to further aid them in their offensive minelaying role, they {{were designed}} to resemble British cruisers to help conceal their identity.|$|E

5|$|During {{the period}} when various Islamic empires {{controlled}} much of the Middle East as well as parts of West Africa and the Iberian peninsula, Muslim armies consisted mostly of cavalry, made up of fighters from various local groups, mercenaries and Turkoman tribesmen. The latter were considered particularly skilled as both lancers and mounted archers. In the 9th century the use of Mamluks, slaves raised to be soldiers for various Muslim rulers, became increasingly common. Mobile tactics, advanced breeding of horses, and detailed training manuals made Mamluk cavalry a highly efficient fighting force. The use of armies consisting mostly of cavalry continued among the Turkish people who founded the Ottoman Empire. <b>Their</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> large mounted forces lead to an establishment of the sipahi, cavalry soldiers who were granted lands in exchange for providing military service in times of war.|$|E
5|$|Eliot {{started writing}} East Coker in 1939, and {{modelled}} the poem after Burnt Norton {{as a way}} to focus his thoughts. The poem served as a sort of opposite to the popular idea that The Waste Land served as an expression of disillusionment after World War I, though Eliot never accepted this interpretation. The poem focuses on life, death, and continuity between the two. Humans are seen as disorderly and science is viewed as unable to save mankind from its flaws. Instead, science and reason lead mankind to warfare, and humanity needs to become humble in order to escape the cycle of destruction. To be saved, people must recognize Christ as their savior as well as <b>their</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> redemption.|$|E
5|$|Limited by <b>their</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> water, trees such as willows, alders, and ponderosa pines {{are found}} only near the monument's streams or springs. Serviceberry bushes and shrubs like {{mountain}} mahogany {{are found in}} places where moisture collects near rock slides and ledges. Elsewhere long-rooted rabbitbrush has adapted to survive in dry areas. Other shrubs with adaptive properties include greasewood, sagebrush, shadscale, broom snakeweed, antelope bitterbrush, and purple sage. Western junipers, which have extensive root systems, thrive in the dry climate; {{in the absence of}} periodic fires they tend to displace grasses and sagebrush and to create relatively barren landscapes. The Park Service is considering controlled burning to limit the junipers and to create open areas for bunchgrasses that re-sprout from their roots after a fire.|$|E

5|$|The Wrights {{wrote to}} several engine manufacturers, but none met <b>their</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a {{sufficiently}} lightweight powerplant. They turned to their shop mechanic, Charlie Taylor, who built an engine in {{just six weeks}} in close consultation with the brothers. To keep the weight low enough, the engine block was cast from aluminum, a rare practice for the time. The Wright/Taylor engine had a primitive version of a carburetor, and had no fuel pump. Gasoline was gravity-fed from the fuel tank mounted on a wing strut into a chamber next to the cylinders where it was mixed with air: the fuel-air mixture was then vaporized by heat from the crankcase, forcing it into the cylinders.|$|E

Edwin dies from a heroin overdose, resulting in the family smuggling the body out of a hospital and nearly having it discovered by the police. During the final leg of the trip, Dwayne discovers that he is color blind, which means he cannot become a pilot, a realization that prompts him to finally break his silence, and shout his anger and disdain for his family.|$|E
5|$|Under communism, {{everyone}} was guaranteed employment. However, women suffered the double burden of paid and unpaid work, leading to lower birth rates. The commitment to social equality {{and the issue}} of declining birth rates allowed women to have some rights, such as child care and child allowances. For example, in the Soviet Union, maternity leave was extended to three years and part-time work was introduced. With the collapse of communism, many of these rights have been revoked due to the new largely male oriented democracy that has been put in place. Although there has been an increase in female workers, <b>their</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> welfare support such as child care has not been met, and has been ignored.|$|E

5|$|The Nile {{crocodile}} has {{a reputation}} as the biggest killer of large animals, including humans, on the African continent. It is widely distributed, found in many habitats and cryptically coloured. From a waiting position with only its eyes and nostrils above the water, it can lunge at drinking animals, fishermen, bathers, or people collecting water or washing clothes. Once seized and dragged into the water, there is little chance for the victim to escape. Analysis of attacks show that most take place during the breeding season or when crocodiles are guarding nests or newly hatched young. Although many attacks go unreported, there are estimated to be over 300 per year, 63% of which are fatal. Wild saltwater crocodiles in Australia carried out 62 confirmed and unprovoked attacks causing injury or death between 1971 and 2004. These animals have also caused fatalities in Malaysia, New Guinea, and elsewhere. They are highly territorial and resent intrusion into their territories by other crocodiles, humans, or boats such as canoes. Attacks may come from animals of various sizes, but the larger males are generally responsible for fatalities. As their size increases, so does <b>their</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> larger mammalian prey; pigs, cattle, horses, and humans are all within the size range they seek. Most of the people attacked were either swimming or wading, but in two instances they were asleep in tents.|$|E
