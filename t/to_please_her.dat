5|$|Maria Theresa was {{not just}} {{critical}} of Marie Antoinette. She disliked Leopold's reserve and often blamed him for being cold. She criticised Maria Carolina for her political activities, Ferdinand for his lack of organisation, and Maria Amalia for her poor French and haughtiness. The only child she did not constantly scold was Maria Christina, who enjoyed her mother's complete confidence, though she failed <b>to</b> <b>please</b> <b>her</b> mother in one aspect – she did not produce any surviving children.|$|E
5|$|Shira and Yochay remain {{distant from}} one another afterwards, and he announces {{that he plans to}} move with Mordechai to marry the widow in Belgium. Shira, {{pressured}} by her family, agrees to go forward with the engagement to Yochay, believing it to be the best scenario for everyone. However, the rabbi realizes that Shira is acting <b>to</b> <b>please</b> <b>her</b> family and refuses to condone the marriage.|$|E
5|$|Baron Hector Hulot is {{a living}} manifestation of male sexual desire, {{unrestrained}} and unconcerned with its consequences for the man or his family. As the novel progresses, he becomes consumed by his libido, even in a physical sense. When Valérie tells him to stop dyeing his hair, he does so <b>to</b> <b>please</b> <b>her.</b> His financial woes and public disgrace lead him to flee his own home; {{by the end of}} the book he is an elderly, decrepit shell of a man. Baron Hulot is so overcome by his taste for female flesh that he even asks his wife– without irony– if he can bring home his fifteen-year-old mistress.|$|E

25|$|Clark {{later was}} the hostess of two more specials, another one for NBC {{and one for}} ABC—one which served as a pilot for a {{projected}} weekly series. Clark declined the offer in order <b>to</b> <b>please</b> <b>her</b> children, who disliked living in Los Angeles. Clark starred in the BBC television series This is Petula Clark, which aired from mid-1966 to early 1968.|$|E
25|$|Jones married Mary Joanna ("Janie") Brady (born 1866), {{whose father}} owned the {{boarding}} house where Jones was staying. Since she was Catholic, {{he decided to}} convert and was baptized on November 11, 1886, at St. Bridget's Catholic Church in Whistler, Alabama, <b>to</b> <b>please</b> <b>her.</b> They were married at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Jackson on November 25, 1886. They bought a house at 211 West Chester Street in Jackson, where they raised their three children. By all accounts he was a devoted family man and teetotaler.|$|E
25|$|Cordelia {{arrives at}} the library and unwittingly {{releases}} Vampire Willow, who immediately attacks her, but Wesley intervenes and drives the vampire away. At the Bronze, although Anya exposes Willow's disguise, Buffy defeats the other vampires, then captures the returning doppelganger. Anya returns vampiric Willow to her own timeline, where the alternate Oz immediately kills her. The next day, Percy, thoroughly intimidated by Willow's doppelganger (and believing she was the real Willow), shows up for tutoring with all his work completed and makes it clear he intends <b>to</b> <b>please</b> <b>her</b> from now on.|$|E

25|$|In 1928 Murphy sailed for New York, {{planning}} {{to continue her}} music studies while staying with a well-off great-uncle on Staten Island. Lured by Manhattan, she soon struck off on her own, playing piano for a while at a cafeteria near Columbia University, where she’d befriended students. Unfamiliar with American popular songs, she failed <b>to</b> <b>please</b> <b>her</b> audience but earned a few dollars dishing out food. She was fired from a subsequent job as a restaurant cashier because of her confusion over U.S. coins. With the Great Depression under way and jobs hard to find, she began coloring picture postcards for subsistence wages.|$|E
25|$|Her main {{argument}} was that sex and domestic economics went hand in hand; {{for a woman}} to survive, she was reliant on her sexual assets <b>to</b> <b>please</b> <b>her</b> husband so that he would financially support his family. From childhood, young girls are forced into a social constraint that prepares them for motherhood by the toys that are marketed to them and the clothes designed for them. She argued {{that there should be no}} difference in the clothes that little girls and boys wear, the toys they play with, or the activities they do, and described tomboys as perfect humans who ran around and used their bodies freely and healthily.|$|E
25|$|Malfatti {{is thought}} to have been rather {{discouraged}} from her reception of her highly debated exposition and so it would make sense that she would try <b>to</b> <b>please</b> <b>her</b> audience. However, at the same time, other artists such as Tarsila do Amaral were becoming highly evolved in their search for the Brazilian identity and culture. Although Malfatti's courage and formally trained style introduced a new development to Brazilians, she almost sacrificed her artistic career simply to pave the path for other artists to forge ahead. However she will always be celebrated as the artist who brought Modernism to Brazil and, as that is no small feat, her impact is legendary.|$|E

Men don't get a look in".|$|R
25|$|While Mary {{manages the}} children, other {{problems}} lie with their parents. Winifred {{is aware that}} she is somehow disappointing both her children and her husband ("Being Mrs Banks"). George, on the other hand, can't understand why she finds the role of wife and mother so difficult ("Cherry Tree Lane (reprise)"). In an effort <b>to</b> <b>please</b> <b>her</b> husband, Winifred sends out invitations for a smart tea party. Mrs. Brill makes the preparations, while telling an eager Robertson Ay to keep his hands off. The children inadvertently sabotage the kitchen preparations, but Mary sorts {{it out with a}} lesson ("A Spoonful of Sugar"). However, it is then revealed that none of the invitees are coming.|$|E
25|$|Droste's {{earliest}} {{poems are}} derivative and conventional but in 1820 her work {{began to show}} marked originality when she embarked on a cycle of religious poems, Das geistliche Jahr ("The Spiritual Year"). Droste intended to write one poem for each Sunday and Feast Day of the church year and the cycle was meant <b>to</b> <b>please</b> <b>her</b> devout grandmother, but when Droste had completed 25 poems, she realised they were too personal and showed too many traces of spiritual doubt, so she shelved the work until 1839 when a friend persuaded her to complete the series. Even then she did not publish the poems and they were only offered to the public posthumously in 1851.|$|E
25|$|Terry {{married three}} times and was {{involved}} in numerous relationships. In London, during her engagement at the Haymarket Theatre, {{she and her sister}} Kate had their portraits painted by the eminent artist George Frederic Watts. His famous portraits of Terry include Choosing, in which she must select between earthly vanities, symbolised by showy but scentless camellias, and nobler values symbolised by humble-looking but fragrant violets. His other famous portraits of her include Ophelia and Watchman, and, with Kate, The Sisters. He proposed marriage to Terry in spite of his being three decades her senior. She was impressed with Watts's art and elegant lifestyle, and she wished <b>to</b> <b>please</b> <b>her</b> parents by making an advantageous marriage. She left the stage during the run of Tom Taylor's hit comedy Our American Cousin at the Haymarket, in which she played Mary Meredith.|$|E

5000|$|Centlivre is {{best known}} for her comedies, often {{following}} the Spanish style, which is [...] "romantic in plot and spirit, containing far more of the emotions of love and jealousy than Restoration comedies." [...] This type of comedy tended to focus on the romantic intrigues among a triangle of wealthy main characters (generally one young woman being fought over by two young men, one promiscuous, the other devoted). It often involves disguises, duels (or talk of them), and scenarios that balance emotion and farce. Her best-known comedies feature quick-witted female intellects to equal their male counterparts. Centlivre believed that the purpose of comedy was to entertain. Due to the widespread prejudice against women playwrights, Centlivre was forced to give priority <b>to</b> <b>pleasing</b> <b>her</b> audiences, rather than abiding by theatrical unities and controversial messages.|$|R

25|$|When he was 19, Riley met 15-year-old Marlene Olive while dealing {{drugs at}} her high school. He {{developed}} {{a crush on}} her and began to pursue her. Although she was initially put off by his weight, the couple eventually had sex and began a relationship largely controlled by Marlene Olive. Riley provided her with free drugs, gifts, and transportation, listened to her problems, and sometimes helped her carry out sexual or criminal fantasies. She frequently threatened to break up with Riley unless he did what she wanted and claimed to have magical powers of control over him, in which he reportedly believed. He was anxious <b>to</b> <b>please</b> <b>her</b> {{in order to continue}} the relationship and twice attempted suicide when she briefly broke up with him. As she had with previous boyfriends, Marlene Olive soon began to ask Riley for help or advice in killing her mother or suggest that he himself kill her parents. Jim and Naomi Olive initially approved of their daughter dating Riley, finding him polite and responsible.|$|E

She soon becomes bored, though, and when ex-suitor Pete Martin begins making passes at her, Ted mistakenly believes they've had a fling.

50|$|Daisy (Rhyanna Alexander-Davies) - Daisy is Steph's best friend. Steph doesn't {{treat her}} very well, but Daisy doesn't seem to mind, often causing {{problems}} by her misunderstanding of simple instructions. She {{has a heart}} of gold and is always eager <b>to</b> <b>please,</b> although <b>her</b> honesty often gets in her in trouble, as she tells Steph things about her appearance that she doesn't want to hear.|$|R

[...] She is visibly distraught and in pain during intimate relations with the Khal.

500|$|In 1834 {{a second}} edition was {{published}} {{under the name}} Les Chouans ou La Bretagne en 1799. It had been heavily revised, as per Balzac's style of constantly reworking texts, even after their release. He had been corresponding with Ewelina Hańska, who wrote to him anonymously in 1832. In an attempt <b>to</b> <b>please</b> <b>her,</b> he changed some of the language in Les Chouans for its second edition. [...] "If only you knew," [...] he wrote to her, [...] "how much there is of you in every altered phrase of Chouans!" [...] The second edition also demonstrates the author's maturing political philosophy (softening his representation of the royalists), and the evolved female characters testify to his relationship with Hańska.|$|E
500|$|Heyer {{intended}} the novel {{to be the}} first instalment in a trilogy covering the House of Lancaster at the peak of its power (1393–1435), with John as its central character. She felt that John, now largely unknown today, was ideal because he was a [...] "great man" [...] who lived during the entirety of her selected time period and was the most trusted brother of Henry V. However, Heyer failed to complete the trilogy, finding herself distracted with the writing of her popular Regency novels <b>to</b> <b>please</b> <b>her</b> fans and offset her tax liabilities. She died in 1974, and My Lord John was published by her family a year later. It covered only the early life of John of Lancaster, from 1393 to 1413.|$|E
