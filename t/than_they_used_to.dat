25|$|To {{calculate}} the total benefits a retiree is eligible for, the average indexed monthly salary (AIME) is then {{divided into three}} separate salary brackets—each multiplied by a different benefit percentage. The benefits receivable (the so-called Primary Insurance Amount, PIA) are {{the sum of the}} salary in each bracket times the benefit percentages that apply to each bracket. The benefit percentages are set by Congress and so can easily change in the future. The bendpoints, where the brackets change, are adjusted for inflation each year by Social Security. For example, in 2013 the first bracket runs from $1 to $791/month and is multiplied by the benefit percentage of 90%, the second salary bracket extends from $791 to $4,781/month is multiplied by 32%, the third salary bracket of more than $4,781/month is multiplied by 15%. Any higher incomes than the ceiling income are not FICA covered and are not considered in the benefits calculation or in determining the average indexed monthly salary, AIME. At full retirement age the projected retirement income amount (PIA) is the sum of these three brackets of income multiplied by the appropriate benefit percentages—90%, 32% and 15%. Unlike income tax brackets, the Social Security benefits are heavily biased towards lower salaried workers. Social Security has always been primarily a retirement, disability and spousal insurance policy for low wage workers and a very poor retirement plan for higher salaried workers who hopefully have a supplemental retirement plan unless they want to live on significantly less after retirement <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> earn.|$|E

2500|$|In 1968 Travers {{returned}} to playwriting {{with a new}} farce, Corker's End, which was produced at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, Guildford. The Times commented, [...] "Some of his jokes, which always tended to be outrageous, are perhaps a little more outspoken <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be, but nothing essential has changed. Those who care for farce will enjoy themselves for exactly that reason." [...] In 1970 BBC television broadcast seven Travers plays: Rookery Nook, A Cuckoo in the Nest, Turkey Time, A Cup of Kindness, Plunder, Dirty Work and She Follows Me About. At the age of 83 Travers rewrote the plays for the BBC to concentrate on plot twists and verbal misunderstandings, rather than the high-speed action and split-second timing that characterised the original stage versions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{economic}} {{disparities between}} some classes of European Americans and African Americans have diminished.

African Americans occupy a higher percentage of high-paying jobs within the USA <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to.</b> [...] This has led to a rapidly increasing black upper-middle class. Many of America's suburbs are becoming diversified with black and white residents coexisting in affluent neighborhoods. With the economic division within similar classes declining between races, African-American movement to the suburbs has resulted in some suburbs becoming more diverse.

2500|$|But such probing {{analyses}} {{into various}} shoppers' psyches may have ignored other significant factors affecting men's shopping habits, foremost among them women's shopping habits. As the retail analyst Marshal Cohen {{explained in a}} 2005 article in the New York Times entitled, [...] "Gay or Straight? Hard to Tell", {{the fact that women}} buy less of men's clothing <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> has, more than any other factor, propelled men into stores to shop for themselves. [...] "In 1985 only 25 percent of all men's apparel was bought by men, he said; 75 percent was bought by women for men. By 1998 men were buying 52 percent of apparel; in 2004 that number grew to 69 percent and shows no sign of slowing." [...] One result of this shift was the revelation that men cared more about how they look than the women shopping for them had.|$|E
2500|$|While {{historically}} {{widespread and}} quite common {{in areas of}} native forest all over the country, all species in this genus are of conservation concern in the present day. All nine species of Naultinus are declining in the wild and are much harder to find <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be; the populations of the various species are highly fragmented and approaching extinction, while others in the genus have already gone extinct. Entire populations of certain species, with unique traits and distinctive genetic profiles, have disappeared in the last 20 years. The primary known agents of this catastrophic decline include predation by invasive mammalian and avian species, habitat destruction and poaching for the illegal pet trade. Vespid wasp predation is speculated to be another possible contributing cause. Legal protection {{in the form of}} longer prison sentences for poachers caught with New Zealand protected species has been increased in recent years and translocations of various species to pest free islands have been undertaken with mixed results, but the task of saving these animals remains daunting. The behavioural and visually cryptic nature of these animals also pose challenges to their conservation management. The genus is, in general, in [...] "dire need of research, particularly into factors that are causing their apparent decline", certain aspects of which remain unexplained.|$|E
