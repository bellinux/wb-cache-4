5|$|The Japanese {{soldiers}} eventually find Ip at {{the cotton}} mill. Ip tells Chow {{to take his}} wife and son away for protection. Miura tells Ip <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> will be spared if he agrees to instruct the Japanese soldiers in martial arts. Ip refuses and challenges Miura to a match, which Miura accepts, both because of his love for martial arts and because refusing the challenge would be a humiliation to the Japanese. The match between Ip and Miura is held in public in Foshan's square. Sato tells Ip <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> will be spared if he lets the general win.|$|E
5|$|Al-Maʿarri's {{fundamental}} pessimism {{is expressed}} in his anti-natalist recommendation that no children should be begotten, so as to spare them the pains of life. In an elegy composed by him {{over the loss of}} a relative, he combines his grief with observations on the ephemerality of this life: Even on al-Maʿarri's epitaph, he wanted it written <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> was a wrong done by his father and not one that was done by himself.|$|E
5|$|Also {{around age}} 16, Dalton's younger brother grew gravely ill. According to her autobiography, she fasted and prayed that her brother's {{life would be}} spared, and while she prayed this way he {{remained}} alive, although still ill. When Dalton's mother wished that her son's sufferings would end, Dalton stopped praying <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> would be spared and instead prayed that God's will be done. Her little brother died shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Bok began {{a ten-year}} period of slavery {{at the hands}} of Giemma and his son Hamid. He was forced to tend the family's herds of livestock. He had to take them to {{pastures}} in the area and to local watering holes, where he saw other Dinka boys who were also forced to tend herds of livestock. He began to suspect <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> was going to change forever and that his father {{was not going to be}} able to save him. His attempts to speak to the other Dinka boys were futile, as they were speaking Arabic, which he could not understand; they also seemed afraid to speak to him.|$|E
5|$|On May 19, 1865, Davis {{was imprisoned}} in a casemate at Fortress Monroe {{on the coast}} of Virginia. Irons were riveted to his ankles at the order of General Nelson Miles {{who was in charge of}} the fort. Davis was allowed no visitors, and no books except the Bible. He became sicker, and the {{attending}} physician warned <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> was in danger, but this treatment continued for some months until late autumn when he was finally given better quarters. General Miles was transferred in mid-1866, and Davis's treatment continued to improve.|$|E

5|$|Wilberforce's {{health was}} {{continuing}} to fail, and he suffered further illnesses in 1824 and 1825. With his family concerned <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> was endangered, he declined a peerage and resigned {{his seat in}} Parliament, leaving the campaign {{in the hands of}} others. Thomas Clarkson continued to travel, visiting anti-slavery groups throughout Britain, motivating activists and acting as an ambassador for the anti-slavery cause to other countries, while Buxton pursued the cause of reform in Parliament. Public meetings and petitions demanding emancipation continued, with an increasing number supporting immediate abolition rather than the gradual approach favoured by Wilberforce, Clarkson and their colleagues.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{increase}} her resistance to pain he would drop hot sealing wax {{on her back and}} arms or stick pins in her, commanding her not to cry out. He would test her ability to keep secrets by telling her <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> was in danger and she should tell no one. To increase her resistance to the cold, Day instructed Sabrina to wade into Stowe Pool until the water reached her neck, then lie in the nearby meadow until her clothes and hair had dried in the sun. Finally, to test her resistance to luxury, he gave her a big box of handmade silk clothes and had her throw them on a fire. Day had limited success with these techniques. Sabrina became able to endure hot wax dripped on her arm without flinching, but she did tell others of his secret techniques, and could not help screaming whenever he fired his gun at her.|$|E
5|$|Macrinus {{realised}} <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> was {{in danger}} but struggled to decide upon {{a course of action}} and remained at Antioch. He sent a force of cavalry commanded by Ulpinus Julianus to regain control of the rebels, but they failed and Ulpinus died in the attempt. This failure further strengthened Elagabalus' army. Soon after, a force under Elagabalus' tutor Gannys marched on Antioch and engaged Macrinus' army on 8 June 218 near the village of Immae, located approximately 24 miles from Antioch. At some point during the ensuing Battle of Antioch, Macrinus deserted the field and returned to Antioch. Macrinus was then forced to flee from Antioch as fighting erupted in the city as well. Elegabalus himself subsequently entered Antioch as the new ruler of the Roman Empire. Macrinus fled for Rome; he traveled as far as Chalcedon before being recognized and captured. His son and co-emperor Diadumenianus, sent to the care of Artbanus V of Parthia, was himself captured in transit at Zeugma and killed in June of 218. Diadumenianus' reign lasted a total of 14 months, and he was about 10 years old when he died. Macrinus, upon learning of his son's death, tried to escape captivity, but he injured himself in the unsuccessful attempt and was afterward executed in Cappadocia; his head was sent to Elegabalus. Much like Macrinus, Diadumenianus' head was also cut off and sent to Elegabalus as a trophy.|$|E
