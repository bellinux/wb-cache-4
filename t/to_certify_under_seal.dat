40|$|The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (S-O Act) of 2002 {{requires}} principal officers <b>to</b> <b>certify</b> <b>under</b> oath <b>to</b> {{the veracity}} of information contained in SEC filings and opine {{on the effectiveness of}} the internal control system. This study examines the determinants and contents of corporate voluntary disclosure of management 2 ̆ 7 s responsibilities during the five-year period preceding the S-O Act. We predict that the voluntary disclosure of management 2 ̆ 7 s responsibilities for financial information signals certain incentives and characteristics of the reporting firm that are relevant to financial statement users and regulators. Consistent with our predictions, our findings reveal significant differences between issuing and non-issuing firms as to the effectiveness of an individual firm 2 ̆ 7 s internal control system, access to capital markets, audit committee characteristics, and ownership structure. An empirical analysis of the contents of these assertions also reveals different areas of emphasis and selectivity by management, which represents an informative link to existing disclosure mandates. The results of this study contribute to our knowledge of management 2 ̆ 7 s motivations for voluntary disclosure and lend credence to the mandatory certification requirements and related disclosure reforms established in the post-Enron era...|$|R

One opinion is that only those who {{are subject to the}} expatriation tax (so-called [...] "covered expatriates") appear in the list.

Those with this opinion include David Lesperance and John Gaver. In contrast, Andrew Mitchel, a Connecticut tax lawyer interviewed by the The Wall Street Journal for its reports on Americans giving up citizenship, states that the list is required to include all former citizens. Michael Kirsch also states that the list is required to include all former citizens, not just those deemed by Section 877 to be giving up citizenship for tax reasons.|$|R
