25|$|Both when {{encrypting}} {{messages and}} when verifying signatures, {{it is critical}} that the public key used to send messages to someone or some entity actually does 'belong' to the intended recipient. Simply downloading a public key from somewhere is not an overwhelming assurance of that association; deliberate (or accidental) impersonation is possible. From its first version, PGP has always included provisions for distributing user's public keys in an 'identity certificate', which is also constructed cryptographically so that any tampering (or accidental garble) is readily detectable. However, merely making a certificate which is impossible to modify without being detected is insufficient; this can prevent corruption only after the certificate has been created, not before. Users must also ensure by some means that the public key in a certificate actually does belong to the person or entity claiming it. From its first release, PGP products have included an internal certificate 'vetting scheme' to assist with this, a <b>trust</b> <b>model</b> which has been called a web of trust. A given public key (or more specifically, information binding a user name to a key) may be digitally signed by a third party user to attest to the association between someone (actually a user name) and the key. There are several levels of confidence which can be included in such signatures. Although many programs read and write this information, few (if any) include this level of certification when calculating whether to trust a key.|$|E

Previous literature used <b>trust</b> <b>models</b> to stop malicious SUs (and their sensors) from deceiving the CSS, but did not consider the <b>trust</b> <b>models</b> themselves to be the target of attacks. <b>Trust</b> <b>models</b> were considered reliable solutions against SSDF attacks and malfunctioning sensors, but to our knowledge, none of the papers discussed how to manipulate and disrupt <b>trust</b> <b>models.</b> We realized the vulnerability of <b>trust</b> <b>models</b> due to their coarse threshold of penalizing inaccurate sensor reports, i.e., a sensor is deemed untrustworthy {{if it does not}} behave in a predetermined way. However, if an attacker knows how the sensors should behave, then they can leverage rogue signals to disrupt typical sensor behavior and thus destroy their reputations. To protect sensor reputations, we explored techniques from social network analytics, such as cluster analysis and community detection, as opposed to relying on RSS models or shadow fading estimations to predict the correct sensor report.|$|R

50|$|NDN’s {{data-centric}} {{security has}} natural applications to content access control and infrastructure security. Applications can encrypt data and distribute keys as named packets {{using the same}} named infrastructure to distribute keys, effectively limiting the data security perimeter to {{the context of a}} single application. To verify a data packet’s signature, an application can fetch the appropriate key, identified in the packet’s key locator field, just like any other content. But trust management, i.e., how to determine the authenticity of a given key for a particular packet in a given application, is a primary research challenge. Consistent with an experimental approach, NDN trust management research is driven by application development and use: solving specific problems first and then identifying common patterns.For example, the security needs of NLSR required development of a simple hierarchical <b>trust</b> <b>model,</b> with keys at lower (closer to root) levels, being used to sign keys in higher levels in which keys are published with names that reflect their trust relationship. In this <b>trust</b> <b>model,</b> the namespace matches the hierarchy of trust delegation, i.e., /root/site/operator/ router/process. Publishing keys with a particular name in the hierarchy authorizes them to sign specific data packets and limits their scope. This paradigm can be easily extended to Other applications where real world trust tends to follow a hierarchical pattern, such as in our building management systems (BMS)Since NDN leaves the <b>trust</b> <b>model</b> under the control of each application, more flexible and expressive trust relations, may also be expressed. One such example is ChronoChat, which motivated experimentation with a web-of-trust model. The security model is that a current chatroom participant can introduce a newcomer to others by signing the newcomer’s key. Future applications will implement a cross-certifying model (SDSI) 3, which provides more redundancy of verification, allowing data and key names to be independent, which more easily accommodates a variety of real-world trust relationships.|$|E
40|$|Role-based {{access control}} (RBAC) {{model is a}} widely used access control model which can simplify {{security}} management in large-scale systems. Recently, several cryptographic RBAC schemes have been proposed to integrate cryptographic techniques with RBAC models to secure data storage in an outsourced environment such as a cloud. These schemes allow data to be encrypted {{in such a way}} that only the users who are members of an appropriate role can decrypt and view the data. However, the issue of trust in such a data storage system is not addressed in these schemes. In this paper, we propose <b>trust</b> <b>models</b> to improve the security of such a system which uses cryptographic RBAC schemes. The <b>trust</b> <b>models</b> provide an approach for the users and roles to determine the trustworthiness of individual roles and owners in the RBAC system. The users can use the <b>trust</b> <b>models</b> to decide whether to join a particular role for accessing data in the system. The roles can use the <b>trust</b> <b>models</b> in their decision to ensure that only data from data owners with good behaviours are accepted by the roles.

40|$|<b>Trust</b> <b>models</b> are {{mechanisms}} that predict behavior of potential interaction partners. They {{have been proposed}} in several domains and many advances in trust formation have been made recently. The question of comparing <b>trust</b> <b>models,</b> however, is still without a clear answer. Traditionally, authors set up ad hoc experiments and present evaluation results {{that are difficult to}} compare - sometimes even interpret - in the context of other <b>trust</b> <b>models.</b> As a solution, the community came up with common evaluation platforms, called trust testbeds. In this paper we expose shortcomings of evaluation models that existing testbeds use; they evaluate <b>trust</b> <b>models</b> by combining them with some ad hoc decision making mechanism and then evaluate the quality of trust-based decisions. They assume that if all <b>trust</b> <b>models</b> use the same decision making mechanism, the mechanism itself becomes irrelevant for the evaluation. We hypothesized that the choice of decision making mechanism is in fact relevant. To test our claim we built a testbed, called Alpha testbed, that can evaluate <b>trust</b> <b>models</b> either with or without decision making mechanism. With it we evaluated five well-known <b>trust</b> <b>models</b> using two different decision making mechanisms. The results confirm our hypothesis; the choice of decision making mechanisms influences the performance of <b>trust</b> <b>models.</b> Based on our findings, we recommend to evaluate <b>trust</b> <b>models</b> independently of the decision making mechanism - and we also provide a method (and a tool) to do so. © 2013 Elsevier B.
