5|$|Final Fantasy Tactics {{is set in}} {{a fictional}} medieval-inspired kingdom called Ivalice, created by Yasumi Matsuno. The game's story follows Ramza Beoulve, a highborn cadet who finds himself <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> middle of an {{intricate}} military conflict known as The Lion War, where two opposing noble factions are coveting the throne of the kingdom. As the story progresses, Ramza and his allies discover a sinister plot behind the war.|$|E

After the shooting, in which six people were killed, both Kelly and Giffords were <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> media spotlight. His wife's shooting led to a broad national conversation ranging from the duties of a husband to what is acceptable civil discourse.|$|E
5|$|The game {{focuses on}} an amnesiac protagonist who awakens in a cave. Through his explorations, he discovers a plot by the Doctor, a {{megalomaniac}} who intends {{to force the}} inhabitants of the cave to fight for him in his bid to conquer the world. The protagonist is <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> position of savior as he endeavors to defeat the Doctor.|$|E
50|$|Rutsweiler am Glan {{is among}} the Middle Glan Valley’s oldest villages. Before and during Roman times, the area was settled by Celts. After the Romans withdrew, Frankish {{settlers}} came <b>thrusting</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> land.|$|R

50|$|The first Soviet {{attack on}} the evening of the 18 September was repulsed by the Polish defenders. Subsequently the Soviets {{continued}} to push <b>into</b> Wilno. By <b>the</b> end of the day the Soviets had secured the airfield and made several <b>thrusts</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> city, taking the Rasos Cemetery.|$|R
5|$|Wisconsin, {{armed with}} heavy {{anti-aircraft}} batteries, performed escort duty for TF 38's fast carriers during {{air strikes against}} Formosa, Luzon, and the Nansei Shoto to neutralize Japanese forces there and to cover the unfolding Allied Lingayen Gulf operations. Those strikes, lasting from 3–22 January 1945, included a <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> South China Sea, {{in the hope that}} major units of the Imperial Japanese Navy could be drawn into battle.|$|E
5|$|Burial customs, {{at least}} in {{southern}} Poland, included raising kurgans. The urn with the ashes {{was placed on the}} mound or on a post <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground. In that position, few such urns survived, which may be the reason why Slavic burial sites in Poland are rare. All dead, regardless of social status, were cremated and afforded a burial, according to Arab testimonies (one {{from the end of the}} 9th century and another one from about 930). A Slavic funeral feast practice was also mentioned earlier by Theophylact Simocatta.|$|E
5|$|Even {{during the}} Cold War, the {{psychological}} {{impact of a}} battleship was significant. In 1946, USS Missouri was dispatched to deliver {{the remains of the}} ambassador from Turkey, and her presence in Turkish and Greek waters staved off a possible Soviet <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Balkan region. In September 1983, when Druze militia in Lebanon's Shouf Mountains fired upon U.S. Marine peacekeepers, the arrival of USS New Jersey stopped the firing. Gunfire from New Jersey later killed militia leaders.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Pacific region {{had begun}} in early December 1941 with attacks against British and Commonwealth forces in the Battle of Hong Kong and the Malayan campaign, and against the US Pacific Fleet, much of which was caught at anchor in Pearl Harbor. They rapidly {{advanced}} south, overwhelming resistance in Malaya, capturing Singapore in February 1942, and successfully occupying Timor, Rabaul and the Dutch East Indies. While a Japanese naval operation aimed at capturing Port Moresby was defeated in the Battle of the Coral Sea in May, elsewhere American forces in the Philippines capitulated, and Japanese forces advanced towards India through Burma.|$|E
5|$|The mid-11th century Gosforth Cross, {{located in}} Cumbria, England, has been {{described}} as depicting a combination of scenes from the Christian Judgement Day and the pagan Ragnarök. The cross features various figures depicted in Borre style, including a man with a spear facing a monstrous head, one of whose feet is <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> beast's forked tongue and on its lower jaw, while a hand is placed against its upper jaw, a scene interpreted as Víðarr fighting Fenrir. The depiction has also been theorized as a metaphor for Jesus's defeat of Satan.|$|E
5|$|The {{real issue}} is that it moves the moral center more towards the obscene. That it becomes more normal to be more sexually promiscuous, because they are bombarded with imagery that is loaded with innuendo, and that is seen as normal, even preferred... if girls and women find their {{identity}} and self-worth in the approval of people, they will {{do whatever it takes}} to become popular and loved. When stars like Rihanna, who blast sexuality, are <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> limelight, girls tend to think that is the way for them to be valuable. God tells us that we are fearfully and wonderfully made... bearing His image. Rihanna is selling a lie.|$|E
50|$|About 159, the Limes was shifted about 30 km eastwards to the Miltenberg-Walldürn-Buchen-Osterburken line. In 260, Roman hegemony fell. The Alamanni {{were also}} <b>thrusting</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Odenwald and {{settling}} the land between the Main and Neckar, after whom came the Franks. In the 5th century, the Franks, under Clovis I, divided <b>the</b> land up <b>into</b> districts.|$|R

However, after these <b>thrusts</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> national spotlight, Jones became more reclusive. Aside from the installments of the Dorkin" [...] series, Jones had virtually {{disappeared from the}} BMX scene.|$|R
5000|$|These series mascots are the {{personification}} of phallic imagery. For example, they shoot white energy beams from the holes in their heads called the [...] "Men's Beam," [...] which is charged up with every firing by both of them rapidly pelvic <b>thrusting</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air. The pair are never specified as lovers or even necessarily homosexuals in the earlier series. However, in [...] "The legend of Holy Protein", both Samson and Adon's preference are spelt out as [...] "men".|$|R
5|$|By now the Ottomans had {{essentially}} won the war; Byzantium {{was reduced}} to a few settlements other than Constantinople and was forced to recognize its vassal status to the Ottoman Sultan. This vassalage continued until 1394. However, whilst Constantinople had been neutralized, the surrounding Christian powers were still a threat to the Ottomans and Asia Minor was not under complete Ottoman control. The Ottomans continued their <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Balkans, proving to be great conquerors in Europe as they were in Anatolia; in 1385 Sofia was captured from the Bulgarians and Niš was taken the following year. Other smaller states were subjugated as vassals, including the Serbs. Serbian resistance was crushed at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, much of Bulgaria was taken in 1393 by Bayezid I (the Thunderbolt) and in 1396 the last bastion of Bulgarian independence was wiped out when Vdiin fell.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy Tactics (1997), a {{tactical}} role-playing game developed {{and published by}} Square for the Sony PlayStation video game console, marked the first appearance of Ivalice. The game combined thematic elements of the Final Fantasy video game series with a game engine and battle system unlike those previously seen in the franchise. Final Fantasy Tactics {{is set in a}} fictional medieval-inspired kingdom called Ivalice and created by Yasumi Matsuno. The game's story follows Ramza Beoulve, a highborn cadet who finds himself <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> middle of an intricate military conflict known as The Lion War, where two opposing noble factions are coveting the throne of the kingdom. As the story progresses, Ramza and his allies discover a sinister plot behind the war.|$|E
5|$|In late 1203, John {{attempted}} to relieve Château Gaillard, which although besieged by Philip was guarding the eastern flank of Normandy. John attempted a synchronised operation involving land-based and water-borne forces, considered by most historians today {{to have been}} imaginative in conception, but overly complex for forces of the period to have carried out successfully. John's relief operation was blocked by Philip's forces, and John turned back to Brittany {{in an attempt to}} draw Philip away from eastern Normandy. John successfully devastated much of Brittany, but did not deflect Philip's main <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> east of Normandy. Opinions vary amongst historians as to the military skill shown by John during this campaign, with most recent historians arguing that his performance was passable, although not impressive.|$|E

5|$|Kawada's musical style mainly fuses {{rock with}} trance. When Kawada debuted in 2001, she {{originally}} {{felt that the}} music she earned in her career was pocket money. She also felt happy {{that she could be}} based in Sapporo where she could be close to her family and friends, as well as to I've Sound who she felt was like a second family to her. After Kotoko made her major debut in 2004, I've Sound management began discussing the possibility of Kawada making a major debut. At first, she was hesitant because she felt that she would be <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> spotlight, but eventually she accepted the idea. For the first ten years of her career, she always felt that she was a beginner, but this began to change when younger singers made their debuts and began to treat her as an older sister.|$|E
5|$|The Gosforth Cross (920–950), in Cumbria, England, is a {{standing}} cross {{of a typical}} Anglo-Saxon form, carved {{on all sides of}} the long shaft, which is nearly square in section. Apart from panels of ornament, the scenes include a Christian crucifixion, and possibly another scene in Hell, but the other scenes are generally interpreted as narrative incidents from the Ragnarök story, even by a scholar as cautious of such interpretations as David M. Wilson. The Ragnarök battle itself may be depicted on the north side. The cross features various figures depicted in Borre style, including a man with a spear facing a monstrous head, with one foot <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> beast's forked tongue and on its lower jaw, and the other is against its upper jaw, a scene interpreted as Víðarr fighting Fenrir.|$|E
5|$|The initial season {{had nine}} major roles receive star billing. Benjamin McKenzie portrayed protagonist Ryan Atwood, a troubled {{teenager}} who is <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wealthy lifestyle of Newport. Mischa Barton played {{the girl next}} door, Marissa Cooper, with Tate Donovan starring as her financially troubled father Jimmy. Adam Brody acted as geeky ostracized teenager Seth Cohen with Kelly Rowan playing his mother Kirsten, the powerful businesswoman, and Peter Gallagher portraying his father, Sandy, a public defense attorney. Chris Carmack portrayed Marissa's boyfriend Luke Ward. Originally only guest stars, Melinda Clarke starred as Marissa's mother, Julie Cooper, and Rachel Bilson played Summer Roberts, best friend to Marissa and Seth's object of affection. Both gained contracts to the main cast list after thirteen episodes.|$|E

5|$|Wrecking and {{smuggling}} supplemented local incomes. In 1743 John Roberts and Huw Bedward from Y Rhiw {{were found}} guilty {{of the murder of}} two shipwrecked sailors on the beach at Porth Neigwl on 6 January 1742, and hanged; Jonathan Morgan had been killed by a knife <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> nape of his neck, and Edward Halesham, described as a boy, had been choked to death. A ship claimed to be from France unloaded illicit tea and brandy at Aberdaron in 1767, and attempted to sell its cargo to the locals; a Revenue cutter discovered salt being smuggled at Porth Cadlan in 1809; and a schooner en route from Guernsey to Scotland was reported to have offloaded lace, tea, brandy and gin at Y Rhiw in 1824.|$|E
5|$|The HV's (and ARBiH's strategic) {{success was}} a result of a series of {{improvements}} to the armies themselves, and crucial breakthroughs made in the ARSK positions that were subsequently exploited by the HV and the ARBiH. The attack was not immediately successful at all points, but seizing key positions led to the collapse of the ARSK command structure and overall defensive capability. The HV capture of Bosansko Grahovo just before Operation Storm, and the special police's advance to Gračac, made it nearly impossible to defend Knin. In Lika, two guard brigades quickly cut the ARSK-held area (which lacked tactical depth and mobile reserve forces), isolating pockets of resistance, positioning a mobile force for a decisive northward <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Karlovac Corps area of responsibility (AOR), and pushing ARSK towards Banovina. The defeat of the ARSK at Glina and Petrinja, after a tough defence, defeated the ARSK Banija Corps as well, as its reserve was pinned down by the ARBiH. The RSK relied on the Republika Srpska and Yugoslav militaries as its strategic reserve, but they did not intervene in the battle.|$|E

A Rembrandt face is a face partially eclipsed; and the nose, bright and obvious, <b>thrusting</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> riddle of halftones, serves to focus the viewer's attention upon, and to dramatize, the division between a flood of light—an overwhelming clarity—and a brooding duskiness.|$|R
