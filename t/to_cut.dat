5|$|Additional Native resentment {{resulted}} from Amherst's decision in February 1761 <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> {{back on the}} gifts given to the Native Americans. Gift giving had been {{an integral part of}} the relationship between the French and the tribes of the pays d'en haut. Following a Native American custom that carried important symbolic meaning, the French gave presents (such as guns, knives, tobacco, and clothing) to village chiefs, who in turn redistributed these gifts to their people. By this process, the village chiefs gained stature among their people, and were thus able to maintain the alliance with the French. Amherst, however, considered this process to be a form of bribery that was no longer necessary, especially since he was under pressure <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> expenses after the war with France. Many Native Americans regarded this change in policy as an insult and an indication that the British looked upon them as conquered people rather than as allies.|$|E
