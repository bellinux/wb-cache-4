The {{sensitivity of the}} substrates was evaluated from their A^, values and their stability to spontaneous breakdown was determined over an 8 -h period. ^-Nitrophcnyl <b>trimethylacetate</b> showed reasonable sensitivity but was the least stable of the substrates. The other substrata were based on p-nitroanalide chromophores and were very stable. The substrate which showed the highest sensitivity to Akalase was ^-succinyl-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-L-ananyl-p-nitioanilide (£ 3 = 50. 25 /nnol AU" 1 min" 1). This substrate was selected for an 8 -h assay. Esperase (Novo) and Subtilisin Carlsberg were compared with Alcalase with the substrate p-nitrophenyl <b>trimethylacetate.</b> A further evaluation of Af-succinyl-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-p-nitroanilide was made by incubating this substrate with Alcalase over an 8 -h period. There was a gradual reduction in the rate over the 8 -h period but {{it is suggested that}} the enzyme-substrate reaction is lufficiently stable for incorporation in a sensor for long-term monitoring.

40|$|The binding {{constants}} (log?Kass) {{of small}} synthetic receptor molecules based on indolocarbazole, carbazole, indole, urea and some others, {{as well as}} their combinations were measured for small carboxylate anions of different basicity, hydrophilicity and steric demands, that is, <b>trimethylacetate,</b> acetate, benzoate and lactate, in 0. 5 ?% H 2 O/[D 6]DMSO by using the relative NMR-based measurement method. As a result, four separate binding affinity scales (ladders) including thirty-eight receptors were obtained with the scales anchored to indolocarbazole. The results indicate that the binding strength is largely, but not fully, determined by the strength of the primary hydrogen-bonding interaction. The latter in turn is largely determined by the basicity of the anion. The higher is the basicity of the anion the stronger in general is the binding, leading to the approximate order of increasing binding strength, lactate<benzoate<acetate?trimethylacetate, which holds with all investigated receptors. Nevertheless, {{there are a number of}} occasions when the binding order changes with changing of the carboxylate anion, sometimes quite substantially.

The following ex-periments were done to re-evaluate the relative importance of the sympathetic nerves and the adrenal medulla in the cardiac responses of the dog to acute anemia produced by ex-changing dog plasma or dextran for equal volumes of whole blood. METHODS Mongrel dogs weighing between 7. 7 and 23. 6 Kg. were used. Some of these were adrenalectomized several weeks before experiment and maintained on daily intramuscular injections of S ing. of cortisone acetate in saline suspension (Cortone) and 1. 5 mg. of desoxycorticosterone <b>trimethylacetate</b> (Percorten <b>trimethylacetate).</b> The diet consisted of meat and fox chow with 0. 6 per cent saline for drinking water.

In each case a different inhibition pattern is obtained to that observed when the substrate is PNP acetate; for example, propionaldehyde and chloral hydrate competitively inhibit the hydrolysis of PNP acetate, but are mixed inhibitors with PNP pivalate.

Here, the plasma polymerization of three structurally related ester precursors, ethyl isobutyrate (EIB), methyl isobutyrate (MIB) and ethyl <b>trimethylacetate</b> (ETMA) is compared at low and high pressure. In moving from a low pressure to higher pressure regime, significant changes in the plasma chemistry and resulting plasma polymer deposit were observed with much higher retention of chemical functionality at the higher pressure observed. Until now these changes would have been attributed to a decrease in the energy/molecule, however we show by direct measurement of the chemistry and physics of the plasma that there is fundamental shift in the properties of the plasma and surface interactions which explain the results. At low pressure (a regime) precursor fragmentation and neutral deposition dominate resulting in poor functional group retention. Increasing the pressure such that the sheath region close to surfaces becomes collisional (g regime) favours production of protonated precursor ions which retain functionality and dominate the deposition process rather than radical species.

This treatment has most success in patients over the age of 30 years; the older the patient the greater likelihood of clinical improvement. It is not to be recommended in the younger age groups. There is no evidence that a single intra-articular injection of any such corticosteroid causes damage that can be detected radiographically to an apparently sound articular surface. But it is still possible that multiple injections can cause damage, and they should not be used for any age group. In some cases where there is radiographic evidence of articular erosion before treatment, an advance of the lesion with reduction of the size of the mandibular condyle can be expected but is consistent with a reduction of the symptoms. The final result may be said to resemble a pharmacologically-achieved arthroplasty.

The creation of an aorticocaval fistula and the administration of desoxycorti-costerone <b>trimethylacetate</b> and a salt enriched diet in 6 dogs produced mild pulmonary edema and partial expansion of the pulmonary lymphatics 10 to 12 days postoperatively. Elevation of the left atrial pressure to 40 cm of water under pentobarbital anesthesia led to an immediate increase in right duct flow in the "mild failure " dogs, {{in contrast to a}} delayed flow in normal dogs. The average peak flows in the 10 - to 12 -day dogs after increasing the left atrial pressure were higher than the peak flows observed in normal dogs. In addition, the mild failure dogs survived twice as long as normal dogs after acute elevation of the left atrial pressure. These results suggest that an animal with an expanded pulmonary lymph system is better able to withstand the stress of acute elevation of left atrial pressure than a normal animal. The pulmonary lymph system may serve as an important compensatory mechanism in the prevention of fulminating pulmonary edema.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is primarily concerned with the structural aspects of bridging and chelation in organoantimony(V) chemistry. The thesis may be essentially divided into two main parts. The first part examines the reactions {{of a number of}} halogenated oxo-bridged organoantimony compounds (themselves subject to a study in Chapter 2) with a range of potentially bidentate groups (arsinates, phosphinates and carboxylates) to assess the capability of these groups to bridge between antimony centres. Spectroscopic and crystallographic results illustrate that arsinate groups were successfully employed in the formation of quadruply bridged compounds, whereas both arsinate and phosphinate groups enabled the preparation of several triply bridged compounds. In contrast, the shorter 'bite-length' carboxylate groups were unable to span across antimony centres in an analogous manner, although reactions between [Ph 2 SbBrO] 2 and acetate or <b>trimethylacetate</b> groups led to formation of the carboxylate bridged tetra-antimony compounds, [Ph 8 Sbil 4 (mu-O) 4 (mu-O 1. 2) 2 (mu-O 2 CR 3) 2]. The second part is concerned with antimony(V) stereochemistry. Incorporation of the chelating 2, 2 ' -biphenylylene group led to manipulation of the coordination geometry at antimony and the preparation of compounds of the type, PhSb(2, 2 ' -C 12 H 8) X 2,with square pyramidal monomeric units. The compounds, however, possess weak intermolecular connections, giving rise to dimers in the solid state and an increase in the coordination number at antimony. In addition, the related compound, PhSb (o- 02 C 6 Cl 4) Cl 2, also showed distinct Lewis acidity at antimony and was isolated as a diethyl ether adduct.

40|$|Repeated {{administration}} of large doses of isoproterenol to rats produced myocardial enlargement and a fall in blood pressure. A defect in storage of norepinephrine (NE) was manifested by {{a decrease in}} endogenous NE, unim-paired uptake of 3 H-NE, and an accelerated rate of loss of accumulated •*H-NE. This accelerated loss of 3 H-NE was characterized by a more rapid disappearance of 3 H-NE from the granular or microsomal than from the supernatant NE fraction. The increased rate of loss of 3 H-NE could be re-versed by treatment with a ganglionic blocking agent, chlorisondamine, by salt restriction and mercurial diuresis, and by withholding isoproterenol treat-ment for 7 days. The NE storage defect resembled that previously described {{in the hearts of}} rats made hypertensive by {{administration of}} desoxycorticos-terone and NaCl.

Larval development assays were conducted weekly for 14 weeks with ivermectin in Experiment I and ivermectin, avermectinB 2 and levamisole in Experiment II. In Experiment I and II for ivermectin, the LD 50 values rose to a 4 x increase between 50 - 70 DPIand fell again. The general pattern seen following a single infection with all anthelmintics was for the LD 50 values to be relatively constant from 21 - 35 DPI, then rose 2. 5 - 7 x increase to peak 49 - 56 DPI and declined at the same rate again to original starting values by 84 DPI where they remained {{until the end of the}} experiment. In experiments I, the steroid treated group started with similar values but had a 5 x fall by 42 DPI which was not seen in the single infection group.

A series of experiments was undertaken in cows to study the disposition and duration of activity of selected formulations of the synthetic corticosteroid betamethasone (BM). The aim was to select a combination of formulations which would be suitable {{for use in a}} two-injection treatment regimen designed to induce premature parturition in cattle. In an initial experiment, 10 cows each received a subcutaneous injection of 20 ml of 2 mg/ml aqueous suspension of BM, 10 received 2 ml of a 20 mg/ml suspension and a further 10 cows served as saline-treated controls. The BM formulations differed only in their solids:vehicle ratio. Plasma BM, cortisol and glucose concentrations, and differential blood cell counts were studied for 3 days before, and for 19 days after, treatment. The 2 mg/ml suspension produced a markedly higher peak plasma BM concentration than the 20 mg/ml suspension. However, plasma BM levels tended to be maintained for longer by the suspension having the higher solids:vehicle ratio. The administration of BM resulted in depression of early-morning cortisol concentrations, elevation of plasma glucose levels, and elevation of circulating neutrophil numbers. The magnitude and duration of these changes was related to the solids:vehicle ratio of the injected suspensions, with the more concentrated formulation producing effects of greater duration. A second experiment involved 9 cows which were divided into 3 groups, each of which was treated at a dose rate of 0. 1 mg/Kg with sodium phosphate solution or a 2 mg/ml BM suspension or a 20 mg/ml BM suspension. Over a period of several weeks each cow received its allocated formulation by each of 3 routes; intravenous, intramusuclar and subcutaneous. The bioavailability of the BM suspensions was low and the solids:vehicle ratio exerted a profound effect on {{the rate at which the}} steroid was absorbed. The disposition curves of the BM solution were similar regardless of the route of administration and the plasma half-life values of BM sodium phosphate, estimated from 3 experiments in each of 3 cows, were 5. 64, 6. 06 and 6. 43 hours. Ten cows were included in a third experiment. They were treated by subcutaneous injection with 2 ml of a 10 mg/ml BM suspension; a preparation intended for use in the induction of calving. Mean plasma concentrations of BM and glucose were elevated above pre-treatment values for 4 days and 8 days respectively. Mean plasma cortisol levels were profoundly depressed for 2 weeks and in some individuals showed no signs of returning to normal 4 weeks after treatment. Two field trials, involving 619 and 553 cows respectively, were conducted to assess the suitability of BM formulations for the induction of premature calving in commercial dairy herds. In the first trial, the mean stage of pregnancy at which cows were treated was approximately 250 days. Cows received an initial injection of either 2 ml of a 10 mg/ml suspension of BM, 2 ml of a 15 mg/ml BM suspension or 4 ml of a 5 mg/ml suspension of dexamethasone <b>trimethylacetate</b> (DTMA). All cows which had not calved within 10 days of this initial treatment received a 12. 5 ml dose of a 2 mg/ml suspension of BM. In comparison with those cows treated with DTMA, significantly fewer cows treated with the concentrated BM suspensions required a second corticosteroid injection. In all other respects, such as calf mortality, incidence of retained foetal membranes and maternal illnesses, the results of the treatments were not significantly different. The 10 mg/ml BM suspension was therefore deemed to be suitable for use in the induction of calving. The second field trial confirmed the suitability of the 10 mg/ml suspension as an initial treatment to induce calving. Cows which had not calved within 7 days of the initial treatment were injected with 20 mg of BM, either as a 2 mg/ml suspension or as a 2 mg/ml solution of the sodium phosphate ester. After the second steroid injection, those cows which had received the more rapidly absorbed BM solution calved sooner than those which had been treated with the 2 mg/ml suspension. The results of these studies clearly showed that the duration of activity of BM suspensions could be prolonged by increasing their solids:vehicle ratio. It was also shown that a treatment regimen consisting of an initial injection of a 10 mg/ml BM suspension, followed 7 to 10 days later by an injection of a more rapidly absorbed BM formulation, was suitable for the induction of calving as currently practised in New Zealand...|$|E
