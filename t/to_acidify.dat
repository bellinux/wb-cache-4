25|$|Proximal RTA (pRTA) {{is caused}} by a failure of the {{proximal}} tubular cells to reabsorb filtered bicarbonate from the urine, leading to urinary bicarbonate wasting and subsequent acidemia. The distal intercalated cells function normally, so the acidemia is less severe than dRTA and the alpha intercalated cells can produce H+ <b>to</b> <b>acidify</b> the urine to a pH of less than 5.3. pRTA also has several causes, and may occasionally be present as a solitary defect, but is usually associated with a more generalized dysfunction of the proximal tubular cells called Fanconi syndrome, in which there is also phosphaturia, glycosuria, aminoaciduria, uricosuria, and tubular proteinuria.|$|E
25|$|Diacetyl can be {{produced}} by the LAB through metabolism of sugar or of citric acid. While citric acid is naturally present in grapes, {{it is in a}} very small amount with most of it coming from deliberate addition by the winemaker <b>to</b> <b>acidify</b> the wine. In the presence of both malic and citric acids, the LAB use both, but use the malic much more quickly, with the rate of citric use/diacetyl formation influenced by the particular bacterial strain (with most strains of O. oeni producing less diacetyl than Lactobacillus and Pediococcis species), as well as the redox potential of the wine. In wine conditions that have a low redox potential (meaning it is more oxidative such as in a barrel that is not fully topped up), more citric acid will be consumed and diacetyl formed. In more reductive conditions, such as in alcoholic fermentations where yeast populations are at their peak and the wine is heavily saturated with carbon dioxide, the formation of diacetyl is much slower. The yeasts also help keep levels low by consuming diacetyl and reducing it to acetoin and butylene glycol.|$|E

A total of 1, 728 broilers were divided into two groups, with six replicates in each. One group was exposed to dry wood-derived litter, and the other was exposed to dry wood-derived litter sprayed with a mixture of sodium lignosulfonate, formic acid, and propionic acid. At five different times, five chickens from each pen were killed and the intestinal contents from ileum and caeca were collected. The samples were diluted and plated onto selective media to identify coliforms, Lactobacillus spp., Clostridium perfringens, and Enterococcus spp. Covariance analysis of bacterial counts showed significantly lower counts for C. perfringens in the caeca and the ileum and for Enterococcus spp. and Lactobacillus spp. in the ileum in chickens exposed <b>to</b> the <b>acidified</b> litter. Lactobacillus spp. showed significantly higher counts in the caeca in chickens exposed <b>to</b> <b>acidified</b> litter. There was no difference between the two litters with regard to coliforms in the ileum and the caeca or to Enterococcus spp. in the caeca.

We have found that many uropathogenic strains of Escherichia coli display far greater resistance to nitrosative stress than the K- 12 reference strain MG 1655. By selecting and screening for uropathogenic E. coli transposon mutants that are unable to grow in the presence of acidified nitrite, the cadC gene product was identified as a key facilitator of nitrosative stress resistance. Mutation of cadC, or its transcriptional targets cadA and cadB, results in loss of significant production of the polyamine cadaverine and increased sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>acidified</b> nitrite. Exogenous addition of cadaverine or other polyamines rescues growth of cad mutants under nitrosative stress. In wild-type cells, the concentration of cadaverine produced per cell is substantially increased by exposure <b>to</b> <b>acidified</b> nitrite.

In this study, we assessed community metrics (diversity, richness, evenness, biovolume), multivariate community structure and the relative resilience of phytoplankton in limed, acidified and circum-neutral lakes from 1997 to 2009, using multivariate time series modeling. We identified dominant temporal frequencies in the data, allowing us to track community change at distinct temporal scales.
