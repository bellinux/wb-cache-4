500|$|Gjøvik Olympic Cavern Hall ( [...] or [...] ) is an {{ice hockey}} rink located within a {{mountain}} hall in Gjøvik, Norway. With a capacity for 5,500 spectators, the hall also features a 25-meter swimming pool and <b>telecommunications</b> <b>installations.</b> Opened in 1993 and costing 134.6 million Norwegian krone (NOK), it was built for the 1994 Winter Olympics, where it hosted 16 ice hockey matches. It {{is the home of}} Gjøvik Hockey, has hosted the 1995 World Short Track Speed Skating Championships and is also used as an event venue. The structure is the world's largest cavern hall for public use.|$|E

5000|$|In 2008, Jean-Pierre Hansen and Patrick Ouart (now {{personal}} advisor {{for justice}} to French President Nicolas Sarkozy) {{have been recognized}} guilty by a Belgian court of [...] "hacking". In February 2004, they tried to spy the <b>telecommunications</b> <b>installation</b> of an employee of Electrabel.

500|$|The {{facility}} {{consists of}} a [...] main operations building, a [...] building for the emergency power supply, a transformer station, and a mobile research station, {{in addition to the}} radomes. The lot is located above Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani's Mine 3 and is leased to KSAT. The facility is connected to Longyearbyen via a [...] long private road. When the road is closed because of avalanches and land slides, helicopter transport is used. There is a road connecting all the antennas to ease maintenance. Installations at SvalSat not related to satellite communication include a measuring station for radioactive particles in the air operated by Norwegian Seismic Array, a <b>telecommunications</b> <b>installation</b> operated by Telenor, a weather station operated by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute, with information relayed to Svalbard Airport, Longyear, and a weather station operated by SvalSat.|$|R
50|$|The reserve {{shows signs}} of damage due to {{previous}} pastoral clearing and stock water dam construction, as well as continued predation and competition from introduced animals, especially pigs. Infestations of introduced weeds are also a problem. There is an inholding within the reserve on which <b>telecommunications</b> <b>installations</b> have been constructed. These structures are visible from much of the reserve.|$|E

5|$|By 1961, {{when all}} {{airframe}} maintenance at Laverton {{was transferred to}} Nos.2 and 3 Aircraft Depots, No.1 AD had serviced forty-two aircraft types throughout its existence. It continued to maintain aero engines, and began supporting telecommunications equipment as well. The aircraft engine repair facilities at No.1 AD were closed down in 1968. Staff were transferred to No.3 Aircraft Depot at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, {{to prepare for the}} introduction of the General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing bomber to Australian service and concentrate on maintaining the new aircraft's engines. No.1 AD's focus thereafter shifted to ground support, manufacturing, installing, servicing and providing training for navigational, air traffic control, telecommunications and motor transport equipment used by the Air Force and other sections of Defence and government. From 1968 to 1977, the depot was organised into two components, <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Installation</b> and Maintenance Squadron and Ground Equipment Maintenance Squadron. These were subdivided in February 1977 into Telecommunications Squadron (maintaining ground communications equipment for control towers, transmitters and receiving stations in Australia and the region), Radar Squadron (supporting surveillance systems at RAAF Bases Williamtown, Amberley, Townsville, Darwin and Pearce), Ground Equipment Maintenance Squadron (maintaining motor transport, and other ground-based mechanical and electro-mechanical systems), and Intermediate Level Maintenance Squadron (communications, navigation and other ground-based maintenance at Laverton, as well as spectrometric analysis of oil used by the RAAF in aircraft and other equipment).|$|R

40|$|Any {{attention}} paid to the positioning of <b>telecommunications</b> <b>installations</b> in natural landscapes usually relates to the aesthetic impact. However, such paraphernalia, particularly when contrasted with “natural” surroundings, invites us to think beyond the visible. Through Heidegger’s accounts of Zuhandenheit and Vorhandenheit, {{as well as his}} later articulations on “Nature” as it is subjected to the ordering principles of Gestell, this paper aims to highlight the overlaps of the natural and the technological worlds inhabited by communications structures, considering the relationship between the human and the natural realms, through the uncertain electromagnetic phenomena that envelops the two. The essay is underpinned by the extended phenomenological description of an encounter with such technology that includes, following Anthony J. Steinbock’s outline of a phenomenological approach that might begin with the “facts” of the “everyday sciences”, some reference to the basic concepts of physics involved in transmissions technology...|$|E
30|$|The use of {{low power}} devices, {{strategies}} and network designs facilitate {{the use of}} renewable energy sources. Remote regions where grid supplied power is either unavailable or unreliable often utilise diesel generators to provide power. In addition to emitting CO 2, diesel generators can be costly to run due to ever increasing fuel costs and the added expense of fuel transportation to remote areas. Renewable energy sources such as wind turbines and PV arrays are an attractive alternative for remote <b>telecommunications</b> <b>installations</b> both environmentally and economically. An off-grid renewable power system allows a base station {{to be placed in}} the optimum location to serve users, requires no infrastructure to connect to an existing power source and, as no fuel is required, has minimal operating costs. Therefore, using a renewable power system provides an economic as well as environmental justification for the use of low power and energy efficient radios, systems and network designs. As the energy generation and storage system represents a significant proportion of the total cost of a renewable powered base station, minimizing the overall power consumption reduces the required generation potential and storage capacity.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s and 70s, the Röchling Group {{started to}} feel {{the effects of the}} looming {{downturn}} in coal and steel, which escalated into a global steel crisis. The company responded by completely changing its corporate strategy: It sold the Völklingen Ironworks in 1978 and withdrew entirely from the steel industry and the Saarland. Instead of conforming to the economic and science trends at that time, the Group focused on diversification and acquired participations and entire companies in the fields of mechanical engineering, <b>telecommunications,</b> electrical <b>installation,</b> franking systems, and measurement and control technology. The acquisition of the Seeber Group and Sustaplast KG instigated the further expansion of the plastics processing division in the 1980s.|$|R
