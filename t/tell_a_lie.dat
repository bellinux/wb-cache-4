You say it enough, you repeat the lie, you repeat the lie, you repeat the lie and eventually, people believe it. Like blood libel. That's {{the same kind}} of thing. The Germans said enough about the Jews and the people believed it and you had the Holocaust. You <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>lie</b> over and over again.

25|$|Téchiné's {{demonstrated}} his {{flair for}} richly textured, atmospheric storytelling with his next film, the aptly titled thriller Barocco (1976), a crime drama, rooted in expressionist surrealism. A boxer who has accepted {{and then turned}} down a huge bribe from a politician to <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>lie</b> that will influence an election is killed by a hired assassin. The boxer's girlfriend eventually {{falls in love with}} the killer while trying to remake him into the image of her slain lover. The film elicited critical plaudits for its elegant look.|$|E

500|$|... "Gotta Have It" [...] {{is a song}} by American hip hop artists Kanye West and Jay-Z {{from their}} first {{collaborative}} album Watch the Throne (2011).

The song explores themes of wealth, decadence and the economic stature in the US. The song received positive reviews from critics who complimented the production and the clever wordplay of the two rappers.|$|E

500|$|Tiring of the {{guessing}} game, some newspapers {{descended to}} satire. [...] The New Orleans Daily Picayune surveyed the lengthy {{list of candidates}} and announced that [...] "the authors of The Bread Winners [...] will all meet at Chautauqua next summer". Another columnist suggested that a statistic {{be put in the}} next census for the number of people named as the author. The appearance of President Arthur's annual message to Congress in December 1883 caused the Rochester Herald to opine that he had written The Bread-Winners [...] "because a careful comparison of his message with the story shows many words common to both". Another Upstate New York paper, the Troy Times, evoked Parson Weems's tales of George Washington: [...] "We cannot <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>lie.</b> [...] We wrote The Bread winners [...] with our own little hatchet. [...] If any one doubts it, we can show him the hatchet." [...] This admission, the Buffalo Express felt, should {{put an end to the}} discussion.|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{the best-known}} story about Washington's {{childhood}} {{is that he}} chopped down his father's favorite cherry tree and admitted the deed when questioned: [...] "I can't <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>lie,</b> Pa." [...] The anecdote was first reported by biographer Parson Weems, who interviewed people after Washington's death who knew him as a child over a half-century earlier. The Weems text was very widely reprinted throughout the 19th century, for example in McGuffey Readers. Adults wanted children to learn moral lessons from history, especially as taught by example from the lives of great national heroes like Washington. After 1890 historians insisted on scientific research methods to validate every statement, {{and there was no}} documentation for this anecdote apart from Weems' report that he learned it from one of the neighbors who knew the young Washington. Joseph Rodman claimed in 1904 that Weems plagiarized other Washington tales from published fiction set in England, but no one has found an alternative source for the cherry tree story.|$|E
500|$|Jay-Z and Kanye West {{are both}} American rappers who have collaborated on several tracks together, such as singles like [...] "Swagga Like Us", [...] "Run This Town", and [...] "Monster". In 2010, they began {{production}} and recording on a collaborative record Watch the Throne. [...] "Gotta Have It" [...] {{was produced by}} West and the production duo The Neptunes, and incorporates chopped-up James Brown vocal samples and Eastern flute melodies. [...] The song samples three different song; [...] "Don't <b>Tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>Lie</b> About Me and I Won't Tell the Truth About You", [...] "People Get Up and Drive Your Funky Soul" [...] and [...] "My Thang" [...] and was reportedly very expensive to produce. The track was released as the album's sixth single in the US, and it impacted Urban radio on December 6, 2011, and Rhythmic radio on January 31, 2012. The track was performed by West and Jay on their Watch the Throne tour. During Jay-Z's setlist at the 2012 Radio 1's Big Weekend festival, West joined Jay-Z to perform [...] "Gotta Have It" [...] and other Watch the Throne hits like [...] "Niggas in Paris" [...] and [...] "No Church in the Wild".|$|E

500|$|... "No Church in the Wild" [...] {{features}} a cinematic production style {{and serves as}} an [...] "ominous opener." [...] According to Billboard, Odd Future singer Frank Ocean and The-Dream lend their voices to the album's [...] "grim opener," [...] which sets the mood with a [...] "gnarled guitar sample". It {{features a}} bass-heavy beat with guitar riffs, synthesizers, and drums. The song begins with Frank Ocean's chorus followed by a Jay Z verse about various topics including philosophy, braggadocio and religion. On Ocean's chorus, Los Angeles Times writer Randall Roberts stated [...] "with it the listener enters a bejeweled realm, one filled with musings on the spoils of riches and the chaos that accompanies it." [...] The chorus [...] "underpins Jay Z's contemplation of {{the relevance of the}} clergy and ancient philosophers to someone who makes his living on the streets, while R star Frank Ocean questions, [...] "What is a God to a non-believer?"" [...] The chorus then repeats and The-Dream performs a bridge, preceding West's verse where he boasts [...] "You will not control the threesome." [...] West's verse included references to Socrates, the perils of monogamy, [...] "implied regicide" [...] and both rappers [...] "take turns describing a night of decadence that leaves blood on the coliseum walls." [...] The song contains samples from [...] "K Scope" [...] as performed by Phil Manzanera, [...] "Sunshine Help Me" [...] as performed by Spooky Tooth and [...] "Don't <b>Tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>Lie</b> About Me and I Won't Tell the Truth About You" [...] as performed by James Brown. According to Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, the track utilizes [...] "unlikely samples" [...] with [...] "Ocean's haunting vocal against Roxy Music's Phil Manzanera playing a tricksy prog riff." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{contains}} {{a number of}} other cultural references. When Peter and Lois enter their motel room and find a hooker on the bed, Peter warns Lois to stay perfectly still, as the prostitute's vision is based on movement. This is a reference to a scene in the movie Jurassic Park (1993) in which Dr. Grant gives this warning in reference to a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Pinocchio appears in a cutaway gag, in which Gepetto bends over and deliberately sets Pinocchio up to <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>lie</b> in an attempt to emulate anal sex. This was based on a joke MacFarlane's mother had told her friends when he was a child. Lois yells out George Clooney's name when she and Peter are having sex. The 1950s sitcom The Honeymooners is also referenced when a fictional episode of the sitcom is shown in which Ralph Kramden, the show's main character, hits his wife, Alice, something he would only threaten to do on the show. Meg watches an episode of the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men, which shows three men in a living room, one of whom is cut in half at the waist and screaming in agony, the other two standing over him and screaming in horror. Fictional army soldier Flint of [...] appears briefly after Chris is caught drinking vodka, and educates the children on drinking and informs them that [...] "...knowing is half the battle". Flint's voice was provided by Bill Ratner, the actor who had voiced the character in the G.I. Joe television series. According to Seth Green, who voices Chris, the reason the Family Guy cast members did not voice Flint themselves is because if you have the original actor providing the voice [...] "you take it with a little bit more gravitas".|$|E

Later, when asked to comment about his statements, Goodman was unapologetic: [...] "I'm the George Washington of mayors. I can't <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>lie.</b> If they didn't want the answer, the kid shouldn't have asked the question." [...] This caused an outcry from parents whose children heard the remark, and school officials said the remark was inappropriate.|$|E

Vito was impressed when he found out Jim was a volunteer fireman. When Jim first tried to kiss him, Vito pushed him away, called him a fag, and the two scuffled briefly. Several days later, Vito went back to the restaurant and apologized, saying, [...] "Sometimes you <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>lie</b> so long, you don't know when to stop." [...] The two men reconciled. They drove on their motorcycles to a secluded spot by a nearby lake, where they picnicked and had sex. Vito moved in with Jim shortly thereafter.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} whether it is possible to detect deception during the interview of a dyad by observing the nonverbal 2 ̆ 2 partner monitoring 2 ̆ 2 behavior of one dyad partner while the other partner is <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> <b>lie.</b> This study also aimed to assess whether individual differences in the Big Five personality traits, Absorption, and Imaginative Suggestibility are correlated with partner monitoring when one 2 ̆ 7 s partner is <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> <b>lie.</b> Undergraduate psychology students (N= 94) were grouped in dyads and asked to play a game that involved one member of the dyad lying and the other member telling the truth. It was predicted that “partner monitoring” behaviors such as glancing at one 2 ̆ 7 s partner would more frequently be exhibited (a) by the non-lying member of a dyad when his or her partner was <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> <b>lie</b> than (b) by the <b>lying</b> member of <b>a</b> dyad when his or her partner was telling the truth. Participants 2 ̆ 7 responses were videotaped and later coded to determine whether partners were more likely to exhibit partner monitoring behavior when their partner was lying than when their partner was telling the truth. Findings did not indicate that there were any significant differences in partner monitoring behavior between the non-lying member of a dyad (i. e. the Truth Teller) when his or her partner was <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> <b>lie</b> and the <b>lying</b> member of <b>a</b> dyad (i. e. the Liar) when his or her partner was telling the truth. Findings also indicated that there were significant relationships between partner-monitoring behavior while playing the role of the truth teller and two of the individual difference variables: imaginative suggestibility and level of interest in office work. ...|$|R

But you find very few people who don’t at some point <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>lie.</b> Homosexuality is one act, but you can’t say [...] not a Buddhist. Or someone who tells a lie is not a Buddhist.
