However, we must consider the variability related to the light reflex induced by the laboratory environment and the devices themselves [31].

Heart and respiratory rates and/or tidal volume variations are linked to emotional behaviour [32 – 34].

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a robot search task (social tag) that uses social interaction, {{in the form}} of asking for help, as an integral component of <b>task</b> <b>completion.</b> Socially distributed <b>perception</b> is defined as a robot’s ability to augment its limited sensory capacities through social interaction. We describe the task of social tag and its implementation on the robot GRACE for the AAAI 2005 Mobile Robot Competition & Exhibition. We then discuss our observations and analyses of GRACE’s performance as a situated interaction with conference participants. Our results suggest we were successful in promoting a form of social interaction that allowed people to help the robot achieve its goal. Furthermore, we found that different social uses of the physical space had an effect {{on the nature of the}} interaction. Finally, we discuss the implications of this design approach for effective and compelling human-robot interaction, considering its relationship to concepts such as dependency, mixed initiative, and socially distributed cognition.

40|$|Most {{performance}} evaluation {{models in the}} operations management literature implicitly assume that <b>tasks</b> possess standardized <b>completion</b> criteria. However, in many systems, particularly service and professional work, judgment is frequently required {{to determine how much}} time to allocate to a task. In this paper, we show that introducing discretion in <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> adds a fourth variability buffer, quality, to the well-known buffers of capacity, inventory and time. To gain insight into the managerial implications of this difference, we model the work of one- and two-worker systems with discretionary <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> as controlled queues. After characterizing the optimal control policy and identifying some practical heuristics, we use this model to examine the differences between discretionary and nondiscretionary work. We show that in systems with discretionary <b>task</b> <b>completion,</b> (i) adding capacity may actually increase congestion, and (ii) task variability in service time can improve system performance. This implies that it may be suboptimal to expect shorter delays {{as a result of a}} capacity increase, and that task variability reduction may not be an appropriate goal in systems with discretionary <b>task</b> <b>completion.</b> We also find that the benefit of queue pooling is smaller in systems with discretionary <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> than in systems with nondiscretionary <b>task</b> <b>completion.</b> service operations, work systems, white collar work, flexibility, Markov decision process...|$|R

40|$|An {{organizational}} {{strategy to}} develop software {{has appeared in}} the market. Organizations release software source code open and hope to attract volunteers to improve their software, forming what we call an open source project. Examples of organizations that have used this strategy include IBM (Eclipse), SAP (Netweaver) and Mozilla (Thunderbird). Moreover, thousands of these projects have been created {{as a consequence of the}} growing amount of software source code released by individuals. This expressive phenomenon deserves attention for its sudden appearance, newness and usefulness to public and private organizations. To explain the dynamics of open source projects, this research theoretically identified and empirically analyzed a construct – attractiveness – found crucial to them due to its influence on how they are populated and operate, subsequently impacting the qualities of the software produced and of the support provided. Both attractiveness 2 ̆ 7 causes and consequences were put under scrutiny, as well as its indicators. On the side of the consequences, it was theoretically proposed and empirically tested whether the attractiveness of these projects affects their levels of activeness, efficiency, likelihood of <b>task</b> <b>completion,</b> and time for <b>task</b> <b>completion,</b> though not linearly, as task complexity could moderate the relationships between them. Also, it was argued at the theoretical level that activeness, efficiency, likelihood of <b>task</b> <b>completion,</b> and time for <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> mediate the relationship between attractiveness and software/support quality. On the side of attractiveness 2 ̆ 7 causes, it was proposed and tested that five open software projects 2 ̆ 7 characteristics (license type, intended audience, type of project and project’s life-cycle stage) impact attractiveness directly. Additionally, these projects 2 ̆ 7 characteristics were argued to influence projects 2 ̆ 7 levels of activeness, efficiency, likelihood of <b>task</b> <b>completion,</b> and time for <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> (and so an empirical evaluation of their associations was performed). The empirical tests of all these relationships between constructs were carried out using Structural Equation Modeling with Maximum Likelihood on three samples of over 4, 600 projects each, collected from the largest repository of open source software, Sourceforge. net (a repeated cross-sectional approach). The results confirmed the importance of attractiveness, suggesting a direct influence on projects 2 ̆ 7 dynamics, as opposed to the moderated-by-task complexity indirect paths first proposed. Furthermore, all four projects 2 ̆ 7 characteristics studied were found to significantly influence projects 2 ̆ 7 attractiveness, activeness, efficiency, likelihood of <b>task</b> <b>completion,</b> and time for <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> (with the exception of license type and time for <b>task</b> <b>completion).</b> Besides providing a statistical test of these propositions, this study discovered the direction of the influence of each project characteristic on projects 2 ̆ 7 attractiveness, activeness, efficiency, likelihood of <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> and time for <b>task</b> <b>completion.</b> Lastly, conclusions, limitations, and future directions are discussed based on these findings...|$|R

40|$|Behavioral {{momentum}} theory (BMT) provides {{a theoretical framework}} for studying the persistence of behavior when challenged. The typical experimental arrangement to study persistence involves reinforcing a behavior according to a multiple schedules design. Unique schedules of reinforcement are programmed to each component. When steady-state responding occurs, the schedules of reinforcement are disrupted by a challenge condition (e. g., extinction, distraction, or prefeeding). The multiple schedules component that maintains the greatest level of responding during disruption is described as being more persistent. Basic {{research has shown that}} rate of reinforcement is a reliable predictor of persistence. The multiple schedules component associated with the higher rate of reinforcement persists longer than the multiple schedules component associated with the lower rate of reinforcement during disruption. Applied researchers have recently begun translating BMT to problems of social significance. The success of these initial translations suggests that relations between other dimensions of reinforcement and persistence should be studied. The current two-experiment study investigated the effect of quality of reinforcement on the persistence of <b>task</b> <b>completion.</b> Three participants with a history of engaging in problem behavior to escape from demands participated in Experiment I. After showing the conditions under which participants would and would not allocate away from a work task to engage with a preferred item, a baseline measure of <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> was obtained. <b>Task</b> <b>completion</b> was then reinforced with attention or tangibles within a multiple schedules design. Orange tokens signaled access to tangible reinforcement and yellow tokens signaled access to attention reinforcement. After steady-state responding occurred, preference for attention and tangibles was assessed within a concurrent schedules design. Extinction was then implemented to disrupt <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> within each component of the multiple schedules design. Results showed modest differences in the persistence of <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> with <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> in the multiple schedules component associated with the delivery of the more preferred reinforcer persisting longest. The modest differences in persistence were smaller than what has previously been shown in the literature. Thus, a follow-up experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of reinforcer potency on the persistence of <b>task</b> <b>completion.</b> Three participants with a history of engaging in problem behavior to escape from demands participated in Experiment II. After identifying relatively more and less preferred stimuli with a multiple stimulus without replacement (MSWO) preference assessment, a unit price analysis was conducted to evaluate the potency of these two items within a concurrent schedules design. <b>Task</b> <b>completion</b> was then reinforced with the more and less potent reinforcers according to a multiple schedules design. After showing steady-state responding, <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> was disrupted by extinction. Results clearly showed greater persistence of <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> under the component associated with the delivery of the more potent reinforcer for two of three participants.
