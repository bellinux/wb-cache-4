5|$|According to Pulitzer Prize winner Jhumpa Lahiri, Narayan's {{short stories}} {{have the same}} {{captivating}} feeling as his novels, with most of them less than ten pages long, and taking about as many minutes to read.

These characteristics and abilities led Lahiri to classify him as belonging to <b>the</b> <b>pantheon</b> of short-story geniuses that include O. Henry, Frank O'Connor and Flannery O'Connor. Lahiri also compares him to Guy de Maupassant for their ability to compress the narrative without losing the story, and the common themes of middle-class life written with an unyielding and unpitying vision.|$|E

5|$|Shaktism {{is known}} for its various sub-traditions of Tantra, as well as a galaxy of goddesses with {{respective}} systems.

The most common aspects of Devi found in Shaktism include Durga, Kali, Amba, Saraswati, Lakshmi, Parvati and Tripurasundari. The goddess-focussed tradition is particularly popular in West Bengal, Odisha, Assam, Tripura, Mithila (North Bihar) and Nepal and the neighboring regions, which it celebrates through festivals such as the Durga puja. Shaktism's ideas have influenced Vaishnavism and Shaivism traditions, with the goddess considered the Shakti of Vishnu and Shiva respectively, and revered prominently in numerous Hindu temples and festivals.|$|E
