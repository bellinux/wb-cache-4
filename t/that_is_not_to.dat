5|$|Interest rate parity {{rests on}} certain assumptions, the first being that capital is mobile - investors can readily {{exchange}} domestic assets for foreign assets. The second {{assumption is that}} assets have perfect substitutability, following from their similarities in riskiness and liquidity. Given capital mobility and perfect substitutability, investors {{would be expected to}} hold those assets offering greater returns, be they domestic or foreign assets. However, both domestic and foreign assets are held by investors. Therefore, it must be true that no difference can exist between the returns on domestic assets and the returns on foreign assets. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> say that domestic investors and foreign investors will earn equivalent returns, but that a single investor on any given side would expect to earn equivalent returns from either investment decision.|$|E

Armed {{reconnaissance}} – the patrolling of known segments of the trail system by aircraft searching for targets of opportunity – gave way to strikes directed by the sensor system. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> say the Task Force Alpha had operational control of the aircraft that carried out the missions. The Seventh Air Force {{was not about to}} surrender the single air manager control that it had just fought so hard to obtain. Task Force Alpha supported the Seventh by gathering, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence. This intelligence was delivered from Nakhon Phanom to the Seventh's headquarters at Ton Son Nhut Air Base, where it issued the strike orders. The ABCCCs were also {{under the control of the}} Seventh, not Task Force Alpha.|$|E

25|$|<b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> {{say that}} the price of any good or service is simply a {{function}} of the marginal utility that it has for any one individual nor for some ostensibly typical individual.

25|$|The Greeks took much {{of their}} designs from outer origins, such as Asia, when Alexander the Great conquered part of it. In earlier designs, other European {{influences}} can also be detected.

However, by 27 BC, Greek designs were heavily influenced by the Roman culture. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> say that indigenous design did not thrive.

25|$|The {{tempo of}} marches varies significantly. While most bands perform marches {{in their own}} tempo, most marches are quick (faster than a waltz, as fast as or slower than a polka). As alluded to before, most march composers did not {{designate}} a specific tempo on their manuscripts. However, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> say the march music composer is random with his/her tempo while conducting the march. For example, John Philip Sousa conducted his marches using around 120 beats per minute. Most European march composers, however, conducted their marches in a slower style, using around 100 beats per minute. There are, however, many and notable exceptions: see concert march and screamer.|$|E
25|$|The War Brides Act of 1945, and {{subsequent}} Alien Fiancées and Fiancés Act of 1946, allowed veterans, {{to return to}} the Philippines to bring back fiancées, wives, and children. In the years following the war, some sixteen thousand Filipinas entered the United States as war brides. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> say only women and children were beneficiaries of the acts for it was recorded that a lone Filipino groom immigrated during this period. These new immigrants enabled the formation of a second generation of Filipino Americans that grew the Filipino American communities, providing nuclear families. Immigration levels were impacted by the independence of the Philippines from the United States, that occurred on 4 July 1946. The quota of non-naval immigration increased slightly to 100 due to the passage of the Luce–Celler Act of 1946. Thus, Filipino American communities developed around United States Navy bases, whose impact can still be seen today. Filipino American communities were also settled near Army and Air Force bases. After World War II, until 1965, half of all Filipino immigrants to the United States were wives of U.S. servicemembers. In 1946, the Filipino Naturalization Act allowed for naturalization, and citizenship for Filipinos who had arrived before March 1943. Beginning in 1948, due to the U.S. Education Exchange Act, Filipino nurses began to immigrate to the United States, with 7,000 Filipino nurses coming to the United States in 1948.|$|E

25|$|The dialogical part of ontological hermeneutics {{states that}} Dasein co-creates meaning from his self-interpretations and {{subjective}} experiences {{through the process}} of dialogue, i.e. conversing with others. Human beings are constantly engaged in dialogue with others and their world around them. Macmurray postulated that dialogue is our primary, if not only, source of knowledge. Bakhtin claimed that human beings are more than beings who engage in dialogue, but that they are dialogical beings composed of multiple simultaneous voices: voices that are their own and voices that belong to others. These voices represent who Dasein is, his or her dispositions, and his or her roles in society. In this case, the term voice is meant to signify a particular role Dasein takes up or a particular aspect of who Dasein is. These voices of human beings are not {{to be thought of as}} hallucinated voices, as in psychosis, but rather different elements of who Dasein is: I like Italian food as one voice and I do not like it when people interrupt me as another voice, or I am a therapist as one voice but I am a patient when I visit my primary care physician as another. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> say that these voices determine Dasein's actions or behaviors. On the contrary, Dasein is an agentic being (a being capable of choice) who thinks, acts, and chooses for himself. But this process “emerges through conversations among functionally independent elements within persons” (Lysaker & Lysaker: 2). The emergence of these multiple voices within us via multitudes of ongoing conversations with others is why Bakhtin described us as polyphonic beings, or “products of ongoing series of dialogues among distinct voices” (Lysaker & Lysaker: 2).|$|E

500|$|<b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> say his operas did {{not come}} as great innovations.

Never before had opera been so harmonically complex and direct. No longer was there the empty vocal display of the bel canto period composers. Granted, {{there is a significant}} amount of vocal fireworks, but they exist for the purpose of drama, not to show off singers. Aside from this, his use of the chorus was entirely new. Before Nabucco, an opera's chorus was limited to be only a background voice, another instrument. In Nabucco, this is abolished; he uses the chorus as character, to show the suffering and consensus of the people. The famous [...] "Va, pensiero" [...] is an example of this.|$|E

500|$|In pre-Buddhist Brahmanism, Brahmin priests used {{to perform}} s (sacrifices) and thereby {{generating}} merit for the donors who provided gifts for the sacrifice. In Buddhism, {{it was the}} Buddhist monk who assumed this role, considered qualified to receive generosity from devotees and thereby generating merit for them. He came to be described as āhuneyyo ('worthy of offering'), by analogy with the Brahmanical term āhavanīya ('worthy of sacrifice', used in offerings to the ritual fire); and as dakkhiṇeyyo ('qualified to accept the offering'), by analogy with the Brahmanical dakśiṇā, the sacrificial offering itself. The Sangha (monastic community) was also described as [...] ( [...] ; [...] ). The difference with the Brahmanical tradition was, according to Marasinghe, that Buddhism did recognize [...] ways of generating merit apart from offerings to the monk, whereas the Brahmanical yajña [...] emphasized offerings to the Brahmin priest. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> say that such offerings were not important in early Buddhism: giving to the Sangha was the first Buddhist activity which allowed for community participation, and preceded the first rituals in Buddhism.|$|E
500|$|Still, a {{wide range}} of {{viewpoints}} exist. The view that animals have moral rights (animal rights) is a philosophical position proposed by Tom Regan, among others, who argues that animals are beings with beliefs and desires, and as such are the [...] "subjects of a life" [...] with moral value and therefore moral rights. Regan still sees ethical differences between killing human and non-human animals, and argues that to save the former it is permissible to kill the latter. Likewise, a [...] "moral dilemma" [...] view suggests that avoiding potential benefit to humans is unacceptable on similar grounds, and holds the issue to be a dilemma in balancing such harm to humans to the harm done to animals in research. In contrast, an abolitionist view in animal rights holds that there is no moral justification for any harmful research on animals <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> the benefit of the individual animal. Bernard Rollin argues that benefits to human beings cannot outweigh animal suffering, and that human beings have no moral right to use an animal in ways that do not benefit that individual. Another prominent position is that of philosopher Peter Singer, who argues that there are no grounds to include a being's species in considerations of whether their suffering is important in utilitarian moral considerations. Malcolm Macleod and collaborators argue that most controlled animal studies do not employ randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding outcome assessment, and that failure to employ these features exaggerates the apparent benefit of drugs tested in animals, leading to a failure to translate much animal research for human benefit.|$|E
