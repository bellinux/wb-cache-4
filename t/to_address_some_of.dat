5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Kingdom Hearts II {{is similar}} to the action RPG and hack and slash gameplay of the first Kingdom Hearts game, though developers made an effort <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the complaints with the previous game. The player directly controls Sora from a third-person camera angle, though first-person perspective is available via Select button. Most of the gameplay occurs on interconnected field maps where battles take place. The game is driven by a linear progression from one story event to the next, usually told via cutscenes, though there are numerous side-quests available that provide bonuses to characters.|$|E
5|$|A Storm Mark III {{was set to}} be {{produced}} for the Israeli defense forces starting in June 2008, when the IDF was to purchase around 600 vehicles beginning in early 2011. Based on the then new four-door Jeep Wrangler JK design, the Mark III is meant <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the shortfalls of the earlier Mark II. Whereas the previous vehicle was an update of the original TK Storm, the Storm III was designed from the outset with a five-door configuration. Unlike the TJ-L, the new JK Storm has a much higher maximum load capacity {{in part due to}} heavier-duty shock absorbers, springs and axles, necessary for an armored version. It includes a standard 2.8L VM Motori turbodiesel and automatic transmission.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of John's reign {{there was a sudden}} change in prices, as bad harvests and high demand for food {{resulted}} in much higher prices for grain and animals. This inflationary pressure was to continue {{for the rest of the}} 13th century and had long-term economic consequences for England. The resulting social pressures were complicated by bursts of deflation that resulted from John's military campaigns. It was usual at the time for the king to collect taxes in silver, which was then re-minted into new coins; these coins would then be put in barrels and sent to royal castles around the country, to be used to hire mercenaries or to meet other costs. At those times when John was preparing for campaigns in Normandy, for example, huge quantities of silver had to be withdrawn from the economy and stored for months, which unintentionally resulted in periods during which silver coins were simply hard to come by, commercial credit difficult to acquire and deflationary pressure placed on the economy. The result was political unrest across the country. John attempted <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the problems with the English currency in 1204 and 1205 by carrying out a radical overhaul of the coinage, improving its quality and consistency.|$|E

More importantly, HRT ignores how race fractured the world system creating differently valued human bodies. In addition <b>to</b> <b>addressing</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the shortcomings of HRT, we present challenges for those in the tradition and advance several alternatives for academics who want to work towards the elimination of race-based inequality in the world...|$|R

5|$|In 1667 Nicholas Steno wrote a {{paper about}} a shark head he had dissected. He {{compared}} {{the teeth of}} the shark with the common fossil objects known as tongue stones. He concluded that the fossils must have been shark teeth. Steno then took an interest in the question of fossils, and <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the objections to their organic origin he began studying rock strata. The result of this work was published in 1669 as Forerunner to a Dissertation on a solid naturally enclosed in a solid. In this book, Steno drew a clear distinction between objects such as rock crystals that really were formed within rocks and those such as fossil shells and shark teeth that were formed outside of those rocks. Steno realized that certain kinds of rock had been formed by the successive deposition of horizontal layers of sediment and that fossils were the remains of living organisms that had become buried in that sediment. Steno who, like almost all 17th century natural philosophers, believed that the earth was only a few thousand years old, resorted to the Biblical flood as a possible explanation for fossils of marine organisms that were far from the sea.|$|E

40|$|How {{we think}} about the {{representation}} of attitudes has a profound impact on how {{we think about}} attitudes themselves, attitude change, and the attitude-behavior relationship. In this paper, we briefly review the model of attribute representation in a distributed, connectionist memory system, which portrays attitudes as time-dependent states of the system rather than as static “things ” that are “stored ” in memory. This model is particularly well-suited <b>to</b> <b>addressing</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the field’s most pressing questions about the multiplicity of attitudes and their stability (or instability) over time. We address several of these questions from the distributed, connectionist perspective, concluding that the new model renders some questions meaningless, suggests straightforward answers to others, and hints at exciting new hypotheses about the answers to still others...|$|R

40|$|Archaeology is a {{visually}} rich discipline with a {{long history}} of utilising images across a variety of contexts within its practice. However, due to the often unavoidably subjective nature of visual interpretation, fundamental issues with its application remain problematic and largely unresolved. Furthermore, in recent years the rising dominance of digital techniques for archaeological threedimensional surveys and interpretive visualisation has resulted in a rapid uptake of emerging technologies without adequate assessment of their impact on the interpretive process and practitioner engagement. Using an example from experimental work in Orkney as a springboard for discussion this paper outlines the need for the field to develop a more practical approach <b>to</b> <b>addressing</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> these recurring issues by developing methodologies which more accurately reflect the multi-layered, interpretive and ambiguous processes involved in archaeological interpretation...|$|R
40|$|We are {{entering}} {{an era of}} Mars exploration in which organic carbon detection, characterization, and structural identification will be key <b>to</b> <b>addressing</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the outstanding science objectives of the Mars Exploration Program.

40|$|Designing {{interaction}} for {{the global}} society entails addressing multiple issues and challenges, ranging from the technical and economic to the legal and ethical. Usability guidelines recommend or prescribe courses of action and thus {{play a significant role}} in designing universally usable systems. Approaches to organizing and applying usability guidelines need to support processes of deliberation and tradeoff, especially when designing for bridging diversity in shared interaction contexts. This paper describes a deliberative approach <b>to</b> <b>addressing</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> these design challenges in a rational way. It argues for organizing guidelines by using concepts from Habermas’s discourse theory and Toulmin’s model of argumentation. Application of the approach is illustrated through a set of research-based Web design and usability guidelines. This paper contributes to the HCI literature by providing a theory-based approach to managing and deliberating on many usability guidelines and related usability issues...|$|R
