The Maniots had chosen Polytsaravos as their position of defence as it was on high ground and was surrounded by rocky slopes. This would have meant that <b>the</b> <b>Egyptians</b> could have been stopped before {{they arrived at the}} town. As part of their defence plan the villages sent all the women and children to the mountains before improving the fortifications.

5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>Egyptians</b> {{believed}} their gods {{to be present}} in the world around them, contact between the human and divine realms was mostly limited to specific circumstances.

5|$|Shortly after dawn, Reshef {{conducted}} a reconnaissance {{of the battlefield}} from a hilltop.

5|$|The {{main points}} of historiographical dispute {{about the battle}} are whether or not <b>the</b> <b>Egyptians</b> were {{planning}} to advance northward toward Tel Aviv, {{and whether or not}} the battle was one of the turning points of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. On June 18, after the first truce of the war took effect, Nahum Sarig said in a staff meeting, attended by the Minister of Defense, that at the time the Egyptian plans were not clear, but that now their plans were to penetrate the Negev. Ben Gurion, on the other hand, noted in his diary that <b>the</b> <b>Egyptians</b> were set on taking Tel Aviv and advancing north. In 1958, Major General Yitzhak Rabin addressed the issue; he felt that the Egyptian stop at Isdud was the result of technical difficulties, following fifteen days of continuous movement, including battles along the way. This, Rabin thought, along with ground and aerial counterattacks, eventually delayed their drive on Tel Aviv. Later, he said, <b>the</b> <b>Egyptians</b> tried to make contact with the Jordanian forces at Latrun and, after a failed pincer movement, tried to cut the Negev off from Israel. According to Israeli historian Reuven Aharoni, the battle's glorification and idealization suited the sentimental needs of the Israeli people. He believes that there is still no definite {{answer to the question of}} whether or not <b>the</b> <b>Egyptians</b> planning to drive on to Tel Aviv.|$|E
5|$|Tuvia Raviv's armored brigade {{began its}} diversionary {{attack against the}} 16th Division's {{bridgehead}} at 5:00 PM on October 15, striking at the bridgehead's center from the east, after a fire preparation. It was repulsed by <b>the</b> <b>Egyptians,</b> as had been expected, but succeeded in its purpose. When the 16th Division's southern flank came under increasing Israeli attack, <b>the</b> <b>Egyptians</b> assumed that the Israeli objective was to roll up the Second Army's right flank, not to open a corridor {{to the west bank}} for Israeli forces to cross the canal. For the next 24 hours, this remained the general impression among Egyptian commanders, and they reacted accordingly. Had they discovered the Israelis' true intentions earlier, <b>the</b> <b>Egyptians</b> would almost certainly have been able to defeat the Israeli operation, in light of the greater strength of their forces and reserves near the Deversoir area, on the east and west banks of the Suez Canal.|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Abin the Levite, {{the son of}} Rabbi Judah the Prince, {{taught that}} the Israelites became wealthy from the plague of blood.

When <b>the</b> <b>Egyptian</b> asked <b>the</b> Israelite to give <b>the</b> <b>Egyptian</b> some water with the Israelite's own hand, it still became blood. Even if <b>the</b> <b>Egyptian</b> said to <b>the</b> Israelite that they should both drink from one vessel, the Israelite would drink water, but <b>the</b> <b>Egyptian</b> would drink blood.

By 16:30 eight waves had brought across the canal ten infantry brigades in all five bridgeheads, totaling 23,500 men (around 4,700 at each bridgehead). Each bridgehead was on average six kilometers (3¾ mi) wide and around two kilometers deep. <b>The</b> <b>Egyptians</b> had high-velocity 85mm and 100mm rifled anti-tank guns in action on the east bank by that time.|$|E
5|$|Between December 1964 and February 1965 the royalists discerned four Egyptian {{attempts}} to drive {{directly into the}} Razih mountains.

Meanwhile, the royalists were building up an offensive. The Egyptian line of communications went from San'a to Amran, then Khairath, where it branched off north-eastwards to Harf. From Harf it turned due south to Farah, and then South-eastwards to Humaidat, Mutamah and Hazm. From Hazm it led south-eastwards to Marib and Harib.

5|$|In 1963 and 1964 <b>the</b> <b>Egyptians</b> {{had five}} squadrons of {{aircraft}} in Yemen at airfields near San'a and Hodeida.

They were also flying four-engined Tupolev bombers from bases in Egypt, such as Aswan. All the air crew were Egyptian, {{except for the}} Tupolev bombers which were thought to have mixed Egyptian and Russian personnel. The Ilyushin transports flying between Egypt and Hodeida had Russian crews. Throughout the war, <b>the</b> <b>Egyptians</b> relied on airlift. In January 1964, when royalist forces placed San'a under siege, Egyptian Antonov heavy-lift cargo planes airlifted tons of food and kerosene into the region. <b>The</b> <b>Egyptians</b> estimate that {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars were spent to equip Egyptian and republican Yemeni forces, and in addition, Moscow refurbished the Al-Rawda Airfield outside San'a.

5|$|Israeli Arab {{historian}} Mustafa Kabha {{wrote that}} Egyptian and other Arab historians did not attribute as much {{importance to the}} battle as Israeli ones. They ask what the Egyptian objective was, {{and whether or not}} it was wise to advance without securing their lines of communication. Abdullah el Tell, commander of the Jordanian Legion in Jerusalem, thought that <b>the</b> <b>Egyptians</b> did not consider the Legion's needs. Aware of their weaknesses, they did not let anything distract them from reaching Tel Aviv. The Egyptian war log, from 19:00 on May 28, 1948, showed concern over the lines of communication. Muhammad Nimr al-Hawari wrote that while <b>the</b> <b>Egyptians</b> publicly declared that the target was Tel Aviv, they never actually meant to advance farther than their Isdud fortifications. As evidence, he cited the Egyptian refusal to take the undefended Yibna despite the villagers' repeated cries for help. Bahjat Abu-Gharbiyeh, one of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni's deputies and commander of the Beit Jibrin area, wrote that <b>the</b> <b>Egyptians</b> never had a clear plan, because their leadership were not really interested in a war. Therefore, their efforts were improvised. Kabha concludes that Arab historiography considers the battle the successful realization of a tactical move, designed to serve the actions of the badly coordinated Arab armies.|$|E
5|$|Louis's {{campaign}} against Egypt {{did not go}} well.

A few years later, in 1252, Louis tried unsuccessfully to ally with <b>the</b> <b>Egyptians,</b> and then in 1253 he sought allies among both the Ismaili Assassins and the Mongols. When he saw a letter from Hethum's brother, the Armenian noble Sempad, which spoke well of the Mongols, Louis dispatched the Franciscan William of Rubruck to the Mongol court. But the Mongol leader Möngke replied with only a letter via William in 1254, asking for the King's submission to Mongol authority.|$|E
5|$|On June 12, Egyptian {{infantry}} numbering {{at about}} 4,000, {{reinforced by the}} republican army and mercenaries from the Aden protectorate invaded the town of Beit Adaqah, about thirty miles west of San'a, where Prince Abdullah held a front extending from the Hodeida road, through Kawakaban province, to southern Hajjah. In two days, the attackers advanced about twelve miles, before being repelled by a counter-attack. The royalists admitted about 250 casualties. Next, <b>the</b> <b>Egyptians</b> attacked Sudah, about 100 miles north-west of San'a. They used the unpopularity of the local royalist commander to bribe several local sheiks and occupied the town unopposed.
