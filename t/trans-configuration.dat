40|$|SummaryContact-dependent {{signaling}} between membrane-linked ligands and receptors {{such as the}} ephrins and Eph receptor tyrosine kinases controls a {{wide range}} of developmental and pathological processes. Paradoxically, many cell types coexpress both ligands and receptors, raising the question of how specific signaling readouts are achieved under these conditions. Here, we studied the signaling activities exerted by coexpressed EphA receptors and GPI-linked ephrin-A ligands in spinal motor neuron growth cones. We demonstrate that coexpressed Eph and ephrin proteins segregate laterally into distinct membrane domains from which they signal opposing effects on the growth cone: EphAs direct growth cone collapse/repulsion and ephrin-As signal motor axon growth/attraction. This subcellular arrangement of Eph-ephrin proteins enables axons to discriminate between cis- versus <b>trans-configurations</b> of ligand/receptor proteins, thereby allowing the utilization of both Ephs and ephrins as functional guidance receptors within the same neuronal growth cone...|$|R

The {{aim was to}} investigate the anthelmintic activities of four flavan- 3 -ols, two galloyl derivatives and 14 purified CT fractions, and to define which structural features of CT determine the anti-parasitic effects against the main cattle nematodes. We used in vitro tests targeting L 1 larvae (feeding inhibition assay) and adults (motility assay) of Ostertagia ostertagi and Cooperia oncophora. In the larval feeding inhibition assay, O. ostertagi L 1 were significantly more susceptible to all CT fractions than C. oncophora L 1. The mean degree of polymerization of CT (i. e. average size) was the most important structural parameter: large CT reduced larval feeding more than small CT. The flavan- 3 -ols of prodelphinidin (PD) -type tannins had a stronger negative influence on parasite activity than the stereochemistry, i. e. cis- vs <b>trans-configurations,</b> or the presence of a gallate group. In contrast, for C. oncophora high reductions in the motility of larvae and adult worms were strongly related with a higher percentage of PDs within the CT fractions while there was no effect of size. Overall, the size and the percentage of PDs within CT seemed {{to be the most important}} parameters that influence anti-parasitic activity...|$|R

The similar 13 C NMR data of C- 3 and C- 4 in 3 and 5 further confirmed the same stereochemistry of this epoxy group. Furthermore, the ROESY correlations of H- 11 /H- 13 a (δ H 1.44), H- 3 /H- 13 a, suggested that H- 11 and H- 3 were co-facial, leading to the determination of {{the relative}} configurations at C- 11 and C- 12 where the other epoxy group resided on. In addition, the ROESY correlations of H- 10 /Me- 20 indicated that 10 -OH and H- 11 were co-facial. Due to the scarcity of material, the modified Mosher’s method could not be able to apply for the determination of the absolute configuration in C- 10 position in 3 at this moment. Thus the structure of sarcophytrol F (3) was tentatively determined as 10 -hydroxyl derivative of 5.|$|R

In these compounds, the diphosphine acted as a chelating ligand bound to the metal center through the two phosphorus atoms. Considering also the weak interaction of the heteroatom (N or O) located {{in the middle of}} the carbon backbone connecting the two P atoms, we found that the coordination arrangement of the diphosphine ligand could be viewed as either meridional (m) or facial (f), and the resulting geometry as pseudooctahedral. The heteroatom of the diphosphine ligand was invariably located trans to the nitrido linkage, as established by X-ray diffraction analysis of the representative compounds 2 m and 4 f. Density functional theoretical calculations showed that in POP-type complexes the mer form is favored by approximately 6 kcal mol- 1, whereas mer and fac isomers are almost isoenergetic in PNP-type complexes. A possible role of noncovalent interactions between the phosphinic phenyl substituents in stabilizing the fac-isomer was also highlighted. The existence of fac-mer isomerism in this class of complexes was attributed to the strong tendency of the two phosphorus atoms to occupy a reciprocal trans-position within the pseudooctahedral geometry. The switching of P atoms between cis- and <b>trans-configurations</b> was confirmed by the observation that the fac isomers, 1 f and 2 f, were irreversibly transformed, in solution, into the corresponding mer isomers, 1 m and 2 m, thus suggesting that fac complexes are more reactive species. Theoretical calculations supported this view by showing that the lowest unoccupied orbitals of the fac isomers are more accessible to a nucleophilic attack with respect to those of the mer ones. Furthermore, the large participation of the Cl orbitals to the HOMO, which is a metal-ligand ð* antibonding in the complex basal plane, shows that the Tc-Cl bonds are labile. As a consequence, facial isomers could be considered as highly electrophilic intermediates that were selectively reactive toward substitution by electron-rich donor ligands. Experimental evidence was in close agreement with this description. It was found that fac-[M(N) Cl 2 (PXP) ] complexes easily underwent ligand-exchange reactions with bidentate donor ligands such as mercaptoacetic acid (NaHL 1), S-methyl 2 -methyldithiocarbazate (H 2 L 2), diethyldithiocarbamate sodium salt (NaL 3), and N-acetyl- L-cysteine (H 2 L 4) to afford stable asymmetrical heterocomplexes of the type fac-[M(N) (Ln) (POP) ]+/ 0 (5 - 8) and fac-[M(N) (Ln) (PNP) ]+/ 0 (9 - 14) comprising two different polydentate chelating ligands bound to the same metal center. In these reactions, the bidentate ligand replaced the two chloride atoms on the equatorial plane of the distorted octahedron, leaving the starting fac-[M(N) (PXP) ] 2 + (X) O, N) moieties untouched. No formation of the corresponding symmetrical complexes containing two identical bidentate ligands was detected over a broad range of experimental conditions. Solution-state NMR studies confirmed that the structure in solution of these heterocomplexes was identical to that established in the solid state by X-ray diffraction analysis of the prototype complexes fac-[M(N) (HL 2) (POP) ][BF 4] [M) Tc, 7; Re, 8] and fac-[Tc- (N) (HL 2) (PNP) ][BF 4], 11.

40|$|AbstractEndomorphin- 1 (Tyr-Pro-Trp-Phe-NH 2) is {{a highly}} {{selective}} and potent agonist of the μ-opioid receptor. To identify structural attributes unique to this opioid peptide and potential sites of recognition, a conformational analysis has been performed using multidimensional NMR and molecular modeling techniques. The spectroscopic results, derived from experiments in both DMSO and water, indicate that endomorphin- 1 exists in the cis- and <b>trans-configuration</b> {{with respect to the}} Pro-omega bond in approximately 25 % and 75 % populations, respectively. In DMSO, the cis-configuration adopts a compact sandwich conformation in which the Tyr and Trp aromatic rings pack against the proline ring, whereas the <b>trans-configuration</b> adopts an extended conformation. Although non-random structure was not observed in water, condensed phase molecular dynamics calculations indicate that trans-isomers dominate the population in this higher dielectric medium. Structural comparison of the cis- and trans-configurations with morphine and selective μ-peptide ligands PL- 017 and d-TIPP, as well as the δ-selective peptide ligands TIPP (δ-antagonist, μ-agonist) and DPDPE were also performed and suggest the trans-isomer is likely the bioactive form.

Generally, the analogues with a cis-configuration had a higher activity than those with a <b>trans-configuration.</b> The growth inhibitory effect of the compounds decreased with increasing alkoxy chain length, but the compound with a hydroxy group had the lowest growth inhibitory effect. One analogue, cis- 5 -F- 5, 6 -dihydro- 6 -methoxy-uracil had a higher antiproliferative effect than FU {{in one of the}} cell lines. Effects on thymidylate synthase (TS), the possible target of these analogues, were evaluated by thymidine rescue of growth inhibition and incorporation of tritiated deoxyuridine (3 H-UdR) into DNA. In solid tumour cell lines addition of TdR reversed the antiproliferative effect. Inhibition of TS in intact cells was determined by measuring 3 H-UdR incorporation in two cell lines.

40|$|In recent papers [1 - 3] we {{have pointed}} out that stable {{configurations}} of polypeptide chains must show the bond distances and bond angles found in simple peptides and related simple substances, that each amide group must be planar, with either the cis-configuration or the <b>trans-configuration</b> about the C'-N bond, and that the carbonyl and imino groups (except for proline or hydroxyproline residues) must be involved in the formation of hydrogen bonds, with N-H•••O distance approximately 2. 8 Å, and with the oxygen atom nearly on the N-H axis. We have also presented evidence indicating that certain configurations around the two single bonds from the amide groups to the a carbon atom are energetically favored, and have discussed the 36 polypeptide-chain structures involving equivalent trans-amide groups with one or another of six favored azimuthal orientations about the N-C single bond and also one of six favored orientations about the C-C' single bond. [4] In the present paper we discuss the 36 configurations of equivalent cis-amide groups corresponding to these favored orientations, and also a few other configurations of cis-amide groups...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{investigation}} of synthesizing a fluorescent analogue of vitamin E, α-tocopentaenol (αT 5). α-Tocopentaenol contains five conjugated double bonds across the phytyl tail, resulting in its fluorescence characteristics. Different methodologies of preparation were attempted to synthesize an all <b>trans-configuration</b> in the five-conjugated double bonds. Unfortunately, across the C 3 ’ bond on the tail, geometric isomers were obtained. However, TBSO-αT 5 was produced {{in what appeared to be}} ≈ 2 : 1 E:Z mixture across the C 3 ’ bond (having the four other olefins with trans-configurations). α-Tocopentaenol showed a strong absorbance in ethanol with a maximum λab= 338 nm. This compound is stable as an oil, stored at - 78 ˚C and protected from light for over a month with minimal degradation. Because αT 5 resembles the naturally occurring form of the vitamin E, this analogue will enhance our ability to study the biological activity of vitamin E and will create an easy method of monitoring its presence in solution and cells...|$|E
40|$|The carbapenems {{differ from}} the {{penicillins}} (penams) in having an unsaturatcd bond between C 2 and C 3 and a carbon atom replacing sulphur at position 1 of the thiazolidine ring. The various carbapenems differ primarily in {{the configuration of the}} side chains at C 2 and C 6. Carbapenems include the thienamycins, olivanic acids, carpetimycins, asparenomycins, pluracidomycins, and other natural and semi-syn-thetic compounds. Carbapenems vary in their stability and resistance to /Macta-mases, ability to inhibit and to induce /J-lactamases, and in-vitro spectra of activity. Many are highly unstable in solution. Some are degraded by mammalian dehydro-peptidases in viva. The hydroxyethyl side chain in the a or <b>trans-configuration</b> at C 6 in thienamycin provides striking resistance to /J-lactamases, but this compound is highly unstable in concentrated solution and the solid state. The Ar-formimidoyl derivative of thienamycin (imipenem) is more stable in solution and has broad-spectrum activity against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. However, imipenem is not stable to renal dehydropeptidases and its degradation products are nephrotoxic in certain animals. It is thus administered with the dehydropeptidase inhibitor cilas...|$|E
40|$|Most enzymes in {{the central}} pathway of {{carotenoid}} biosynthesis in plants have been identified and studied at the molecular level. However, the specificity and role of cis-trans-isomerization of carotenoids, which occurs in vivo during carotene biosynthesis, remained unresolved. We have previously cloned from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) the CrtISO gene, which encodes a carotene cis-trans-isomerase. To study the biochemical properties of the enzyme, we developed an enzymatic in vitro assay in which a purified tomato CRTISO polypeptide overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells is active {{in the presence of}} an E. coli lysate that includes membranes. We show that CRTISO is an authentic carotene isomerase. Its catalytic activity of cis-to-trans isomerization requires redox-active components, suggesting that isomerization is achieved by a reversible redox reaction acting at specific double bonds. Our data demonstrate that CRTISO isomerizes adjacent cis-double bonds at C 7 and C 9 pairwise into the <b>trans-configuration,</b> but is incapable of isomerizing single cis-double bonds at C 9 and C 9 ′. We conclude that CRTISO functions in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway in parallel with ζ-carotene desaturation, by converting 7, 9, 9 ′-tri-cis-neurosporene to 9 ′-cis-neurosporene and 7 ′ 9 ′-di-cis-lycopene into all-trans-lycopene. These results establish that in plants carotene desaturation to lycopene proceeds via cis-carotene intermediates...|$|E
40|$|The 1 H-NMR {{spectrum}} of the neuropeptide head activator in aqueous solution has been completely assigned by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and selective deuteration. The apparent pseudo-first-order exchange rate, kex, of the backbone amide protons and the correspondent activation enthalpies, delta H not equal to, were determined. The exchange rates decrease and the activation enthalpies increase from the N-terminal to the C-terminal part of the peptide. The exchange rates vary from 21 to 0. 3 s- 1 at 274 K, the activation enthalpies from 60 to 75 kJ. mol- 1. The pK values of the terminal carboxyl group and of the lysine amino group have been estimated as 3. 3 and 10. 3, respectively. The NMR results {{are in line with}} a dimeric structure in an antisymmetric arrangement of the subunits, forming an antiparallel beta-pleated sheet between C-terminal segments. The peptide bonds between pGlu- 1, Pro- 2 and Pro- 3 are predominantly in <b>trans-configuration,</b> in fact no cis-isomers can be observed spectroscopically. The structure appears to be very stable; in the temperature and pH range studied, i. e., from 274 to 338 K and from pH 0. 8 to pH 11. 6, there are no spectroscopic indications for a global structural change...|$|E
