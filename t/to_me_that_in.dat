She has changed since her early days, having calmed down a little {{in terms of her}} often out of control behaviour. Of this Kelly comments: [...] "If someone had said <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> three years' time she'd be Becky McDonald and would be behind the bar in the Rovers, I wouldn't have believed it [...] When Becky first came in she was a totally different character, but she's calmed down a lot and her softer side has come out." ...|$|E
500|$|Shōshi was 16 to 19 when Murasaki {{joined her}} court. According to Arthur Waley, Shōshi was a serious-minded young lady, whose living {{arrangements}} were divided between her father's household and her court at the Imperial Palace. She gathered around her talented women {{writers such as}} Izumi Shikibu and Akazome Emon—the author of an early vernacular history, The Tale of Flowering Fortunes. The rivalry that existed among the women is evident in Murasaki's diary, where she wrote disparagingly of Izumi: [...] "Izumi Shikibu is an amusing letter-writer; {{but there is something}} not very satisfactory about her. She has a gift for dashing off informal compositions in a careless running-hand; but in poetry she needs either an interesting subject or some classic model to imitate. Indeed it does not seem <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> herself she is really a poet at all." ...|$|E

Hindus are generally conservative but it seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> ancient India, they even celebrated sex as an enjoyable part of procreation, where priests were invited for ceremonies in their home to mark the beginning of the process ...|$|E

2500|$|There are two further cities hosting major institutions, Luxembourg (judicial {{and second}} seats) and Strasbourg (Parliament's main seat). Authorities in Strasbourg and organisations based there also refer to Strasbourg as the [...] "capital" [...] of Europe and Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg are also {{referred}} to as the joint capitals of Europe. In 2010, Vice President of the United States Joe Biden, while speaking to the European Parliament, said: [...] ""As you probably know, some American politicians and American journalists refer to Washington, D.C. as the 'capital of the free world.' But it seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> this great city, which boasts 1,000 years of history and which serves as the capital of Belgium, the home of the European Union, and the headquarters for NATO, this city has its own legitimate claim to that title." ...|$|E
