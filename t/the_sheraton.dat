25|$|Around 1970, Gibson {{replaced}} the P-90 on several models with a mini side-by-side humbucker {{now known as}} the mini-humbucker. This pickup was originally used on Epiphone models such as <b>the</b> <b>Sheraton</b> and with suitable mounting hardware became interchangeable with the P-90. In response to a resurgence of popularity of the P-90 Gibson issued the P-100, a stacked version (see above) of the P-90. Gibson also makes a new noiseless P-90 version called the H-90, which is found in Billie Joe Armstrong's Signature Les Paul Junior. The H-90 has two stacked coils and Gibson claims that it does not lose the characteristics of a P-90 although many players feel differently, perhaps contributing to its lack of use in other guitars.|$|E
