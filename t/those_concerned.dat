5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, the building's {{exterior}} {{became increasingly}} dilapidated; among <b>those</b> <b>concerned</b> about the church's deterioration was Russian bard Vladimir Vysotsky, {{who lived in}} a house across the street. In the late 1970s the city considered renovating the building, possibly to use as a concert hall for organ recitals, or as a general cultural administration centre. These projects were never carried out due to resistance from the research institute.|$|E
5|$|The Office of the Special Prosecutor {{was founded}} {{with the passage}} of a bill in the Icelandic {{parliament}} 10 December 2008.

5|$|As {{early as}} 1966 Uptown {{was among the}} {{possible}} sites proposed for a northeast-side commuter campus in the City Colleges of Chicago community college district. The Uptown site west of the Wilson Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) station was opposed by <b>those</b> <b>concerned</b> for the displacement of low income residents, largely blacks, southern whites and American Indians. The project was mired in heated controversy for decades. Avery v Pierce, a federal lawsuit filed in 1975, alleged that the razing of about 3,000 low-income housing units {{for the development of}} Harry S Truman College constituted misspending of funds by the City and Chicago Housing Authority. Plaintiffs were represented by Shiller's former campaign manager, attorney James P. Chapman of the Uptown Peoples Law Center.|$|E

5|$|Many {{different}} versions of the events were set down and distributed due to the excitement around the trial and the public demand for entertainments based on the murder, making it hard for modern readers to discern fact from melodramatic embellishment. Good official records exist from the trial, and the best record of the events surrounding the case is generally considered to be that of James Curtis, a journalist who spent time with Corder and two weeks in Polstead interviewing <b>those</b> <b>concerned.</b> He was apparently so connected with the case that a newspaper artist who was asked to produce a picture of the accused man drew a likeness of Curtis instead of Corder.|$|E
5|$|The freeway east of Santo Road {{encountered}} delays from environmentalists {{over the}} endangered least Bell's vireo, a songbird which faced habitat destruction, {{as well as}} <b>those</b> <b>concerned</b> with the destruction of homes and businesses for the freeway right-of-way. The extension to Mission Gorge Road opened in 1993, and SR52 was completed to SR125 in 1998. Funding issues delayed {{the completion of the}} entire route until 2011, more than fiftyyears after construction began; until then, the city of Santee faced traffic snarls. A widening project was completed in 2007 between Santo Road and Mast Boulevard; further expansion has been put on hold due to state budget concerns.|$|E
5|$|There were <b>those</b> <b>concerned</b> {{that the}} theatre was failing in {{its role as}} {{one of the very few}} {{permitted}} to show legitimate drama. Management of the theatre after it reopened in 1813 fell to Samuel James Arnold, overseen by an amateur board of directors and a subcommittee focusing on the theatre as a centre for national culture. (Lord Byron was briefly on this subcommittee, from June 1815 until leaving England in April 1816.) Actor Edmund Kean was the on-stage highlight; like Macklin before him, he made his reputation as Shylock, premiering in the role in 1814. Kean remained until 1820 through praise and notorious disputes with local playwrights such as Charles Bucke.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, toll roads were gaining in {{popularity}} {{as a mechanism}} for funding new superhighways. This trend started with the Pennsylvania Turnpike in 1940, which was mimicked by other toll roads in New York, New Jersey, several New England states, Ohio, and Colorado. In October 1951, the Highway Council of the Kansas Chamber of Commerce researched the possibility of integrating the state into a potential cross-country turnpike system. Eastern Kansas was also included in an interstate turnpike system stretching from Galveston, Texas to Saint Louis, Missouri, via Kansas City, that was proposed by Oklahoma governor Johnston Murray. Many firms from construction industries, as well as <b>those</b> <b>concerned</b> about the state's economic development, worked to have legislation passed to allow the turnpike to be constructed. Governor Ed Arn and Gale Moss, the State Highway Director, were two major proponents of the turnpike concept.|$|E
25|$|Two {{groups of}} {{individuals}} were investigated, <b>those</b> <b>concerned</b> with personal power, achievement, and independence (agentic group) or <b>those</b> <b>concerned</b> with relationships, interdependence, and others (communion group).

In contrast, communal types showed a recollection bias for emotional memories featuring others, often significant others, in acts of love and friendship.|$|E
