40|$|The {{application}} of multilevel converters for <b>traction</b> <b>drive</b> <b>systems</b> is being investigated. The main {{advantage of this}} kind of topology is that it can generate almost perfect current or voltage waveforms, because it is modulated by amplitude instead of pulse-width. That means that the pulsating torque generated by harmonics can be eliminated, and power losses into the machine due to harmonic currents can also be eliminated. Another advantage {{of this kind of}} drive is that the switching frequency and power rating of the semiconductors is reduced considerably. The amplitude modulation is based on a cascade of N converters scaled in a “trinary ” form (three-state “H ” converters). In the chain of N converters of each phase (N-Stage Converter), there is a “Master converter ” that manages more than 80 % of the total power, and N- 1 “Slave converters ” that take the rest of the power (less than 20 %). One important drawback of this kind of arrangement is that it needs isolated power sources for each one of the N converters, and also for each phase. This paper shows that this problem can be overcome by using isolated motor windings for each phase of the traction motor (which is easy to get in normal machines), and by using low-power high-frequency, bidirectional switching power supplies for the “slave converters”. Simulations using PSIM (Power Electronics Simulator) have demonstrated the feasibility to build drive converters for electric vehicles using multilevel inverters. They are being compared with inverters using the conventional PWM technique. The multilevel converter used in the simulations, works with only four inverters (N= 4) : one Master and three Slaves.

In this context, two three-phase induction motors are associated to five legs power inverter which one leg {{is shared by}} two phases of the motors. The independent control of the two induction motors allows replacing the mechanical differential speeds by an equivalent electrical module called electric differential (ED). In the proposed EV powertrain based on 5 -leg inverter, {{the challenge is to}} achieve a decoupled control of the induction motors to ensure the EV stability while cornering or under slippery road condition. For this, the proposed independent control uses Indirect Field Oriented Control to ensure speed and rotor flux control of each induction motor, a Pulse Width Modulation to provide the command sequences to the 5 -leg inverter and electric differential to generate the an appropriate reference when the two induction motors should be controlled at different speeds. For this, a numerical implementation of the independent controls on an embedded board (TMS 320 F 2812) to ensure a separate control of induction motor fed by the 5 -leg inverter. Moreover, the proposed control takes into account the EV context such as the EV dynamic and uses European and American normalized driving cycles. EV-specific experimental tests on a digital signal processor TMS 320 LF 2812 are carried-out to show the effectiveness of the proposed independent control for ED in terms of robustness and stability...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{permanent}} magnet (SPM) synchronous machines using fractional-slot concentrated windings are being investigated as candidates for high-performance traction machines for automotive electric propulsion systems. It {{has been shown}} analytically and experimentally that such designs can achieve very wide constant-power speed ratios (CPSR) [1, 2]. This work has shown that machines of this type are capable of achieving very low cogging torque amplitudes as well as significantly increasing the machine power density [3 - 5] compared to SPM machines using conventional distributed windings. High efficiency can be achieved in this class of SPM machine by making special efforts to suppress the eddy-current losses in the magnets [6 - 8], accompanied by efforts to minimize the iron losses in the rotor and stator cores. Considerable attention has traditionally been devoted to maximizing the full-load efficiency of traction machines at their rated operating points and along their maximum-power vs. speed envelopes for higher speeds [9, 10]. For example, on-line control approaches have been presented for maximizing the full-load efficiency of PM synchronous machines, {{including the use of}} negative d-axis stator current to reduce the core losses [11, 12]. However, another important performance specification for electric traction applications is the machine's efficiency at partial loads. Partial-load efficiency is particularly important if the target traction application requires long periods of cruising operation at light loads that are significantly lower than the maximum drive capabilities. While the design of the machine itself is clearly important, investigation has shown that this is a case where the choice of the control algorithm plays a critical role in determining the maximum partial-load efficiency that the machine actually achieves in the <b>traction</b> <b>drive</b> <b>system.</b> There is no evidence that this important topic has been addressed for this type of SPM machine by any other authors. This topic takes on even greater significance for fractional-slot concentrated-winding SPM machine designs. In particular, maximizing the torque/power density of this class of SPM machines typically leads to machine designs with high numbers of poles. The resulting high electrical frequencies can easily result in high stator core losses unless special care is taken during the machine design process. The purpose of this report is to discuss a modified vector control algorithm for a fractional-slot concentrated winding SPM machine that has been developed to maximize the machine's partial-load efficiency over a wide range of operating conditions. For purposes of this discussion, a 55 kW (peak) SPM machine designed to meet requirements established in the US FreedomCar program [13] is used as the basis for demonstrating the proposed technique. A combination of closed-form analysis [14] and finite element analysis (FEA) is used during this investigation...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this task was to study permanent magnet (PM) radial-gap <b>traction</b> <b>drive</b> <b>systems</b> that could meet the U. S. Department of Energy FreedomCAR Program's 2010 goals to expose weaknesses or identify strengths. Initially, the approach was to compare attributes such as physical deformations during operation, performance (torque, power, efficiency versus speed), material requirements (strength), material costs, manufacturability, weight, power density, specific power, reliability, and drivability for specific motors. Three motors selected were the commercially available 60 -kW radial-gap surface-mounted PM motor manufactured by UQM Technologies, Inc.; a hypothetical PM motor with rotor-supported magnets similar to the Honda MCF- 21; and Delphi's automotive electric machine drive motor, whose rotor is a ferromagnetic cylinder, held at one end by a shaft that supports the magnets on its inner surface. Potential problems have appeared related to PM motors, such as (1) high no-load spin losses and high operational power losses, probably from eddy current losses in the rotor; (2) the undemonstrated dual mode inverter control (DMIC) for driving a brushless dc motor (BDCM) (UQM and Delphi motors); (3) uncertainty {{about the potential for}} reducing current with DMIC; and (4) uncertainty about the relation between material requirements and maximum rotor speed. Therefore, the approach was changed to study in detail three of the comparison attributes: drivability, performance, and material requirements. Drivability and related problems were examined by demonstrating that DMIC may be used to drive an 18 -pole 30 -kW PM motor to 6000 rpm, where the maximum electrical frequency is 900 Hz. An available axial-gap test motor with 18 poles was used because its control is identical to that of a radial gap PM motor. Performance was analytically examined, which led to a derivation showing that DMIC controls a PM motor so that the motor uses minimum current to produce any power regardless of speed for relative speeds, n = {omega}/{omega}{sub base} {ge} 2. Performance was also examined with efficiency measurements during the 30 -kW PM motor test. Material requirements were examined with finite-element analyses (FEA) to determine the speed and location where yield starts and the corresponding deformations and stresses...|$|R
40|$|Visual Computing Systems (VCS) and Oak Ridge National Laboratory are partnered in a {{research}} effort to design and build a power inverter for use with an automotive traction permanent magnet (PM) motor provided by VCS. The inverter is designed to fit within {{the volume of the}} housing, which is integrated with the motor. Moreover, a modular design for both the inverter and motor is employed to reduce the development cost by stacking modular units to meet the requirement of higher power ratings. The motor is operated in brushless DC mode. The effect of different commutation and current-sensing strategies on current control is analyzed. Torque and regeneration control algorithms are implemented with a digital signal processor. A <b>traction</b> motor <b>drive</b> <b>system</b> is constructed by using two modular inverters and a PM motor with two sets of stator coils. Each inverter separately drives a set of stator coils.

40|$|One {{category}} of mechanical systems that contains power-transferring point contacts is <b>traction</b> <b>drive</b> variators. These variators {{can be used}} in different concepts for Continuously Variable Transmissions (CVTs) and in vehicle applications, in order to achieve optimum engine operating conditions leading to improved driveability, reduced fuel consumption and an increase in overall vehicle performance. The purpose of this work is to present an efficient computational module which generates the tractive forces occurring at the point contact and to show how it can be used within modern simulation software to enable fully dynamic analysis of mechanical <b>traction</b> <b>drive</b> <b>systems.</b> The constitutive relationship between traction and motion is based on a simple concept of dry friction and Hertzian pressure distribution. The relative motion is described by using the fundamental form of the pole concept which requires the presence of rotational motion (spin). This relationship {{can also be used to}} display the isothermal behaviour of contacts, where a solidified oil film is present. The present work is general in the sense that it can handle bi-directional slip conditions, i. e., slip along and perpendicular to the direction of rolling. Earlier efficient methods of analysis only considered slip in the rolling direction. A close study of different numerical methods has been conducted to find the most efficient methods for computation of the general relationships between traction and motion. This has resulted in the following three groups of methods: low slip conditions with fully analytical solutions, moderate slip conditions with partially analytical solutions, and large slip conditions with fully numerical solutions. The required input parameters are the relative motion, the shape of the elliptical contact and the accuracy requested. The corresponding output parameters are the equivalent tractive force and spin torque at the theoretical point of contact. To cover thermal effects at high slip conditions, the isothermal coefficient of friction can be corrected by means of an extension of a simple method by Tevaarwerk for the correction of large spin traction curves to cover the bi-directional slip conditions. This method is verified against experimental data produced by Gaggermeier. Experimental investigations have been conducted on a modified KOPP type <b>traction</b> <b>drive</b> variator to investigate the robustness of the contact module under operating conditions where thermal effects are apparent and the slip conditions are bi-directional. An important finding was that the torque losses are underestimated with the contact model. To cover that a simple formula for rolling resistance was included into the analysis. The contact module comprises general functions for calculation of the contact properties, relative sliding conditions, rolling resistance and tractive effort. It can also be customized with specific functions for detection of the point of contact. This has resulted in a contact module that can be used either in simple simulation software for analysis of simple applications, or in powerful Multi-Body System simulation packages for analysis of more complex applications. Both simple and complex implementations are presented. The new computational module efficiently evaluates the tractive forces for a given arbitrary relative sliding motion as well as the existing rolling resistance in a Hertzian point contact. This has not been available until now. By combining this contact subroutine with a powerful simulation tool such as ADAMS, DADS, Mechanica/MOTION, etc., the mechanical systems investigated can now be modelled in a more realistic way than before. This enables also an introduction of virtual prototyping into the product development process since the iteration between modelling and simulation is fast and the overview of the system is good in spite of the complexity...|$|R
