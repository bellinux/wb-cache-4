5|$|Between December 18 and December 28, 1995—during {{which time}} Hubble orbited the Earth about 150 times—342 {{images of the}} target area in the chosen filters were taken. The total {{exposure}} times at each wavelength were 42.7 hours (300nm), 33.5 hours (450nm), 30.3 hours (606nm) and 34.3 hours (814nm), divided into 342 individual exposures to prevent significant damage to individual images by cosmic rays, which cause bright streaks to appear when <b>they</b> <b>strike</b> CCD detectors. A further 10 Hubble orbits were used to make short exposures of flanking fields to aid follow-up observations by other instruments.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{reported}} that the CWU had started a fighting fund to help support postal workers who were experiencing financial difficulties {{as a result of}} the strike. Postmen lose a day's pay for each day <b>they</b> <b>strike,</b> and although most workers had lost just two days pay so far, many in the London area who had taken part in previous industrial action earlier in the year had lost as much as 18 days of wages. There was also speculation that the CWU lacked the funds for a lengthy dispute and donations to the union's fighting fund were pledged by other unions, including UNISON and Unite.|$|E
5|$|She {{gradually}} becomes {{friends with}} Charlene and Scott Robinson (Jason Donovan). Jane later starts to date Mike. Nell bans her from seeing Mike after her love rival Sue Parker (Kate Gorman) begins to send Nell poison pen letters about Mike. She later allows them be together when Daphne finds out Sue {{is behind the}} letters. After becoming lost in the bush with Shane Ramsay (Peter O'Brien), <b>they</b> <b>strike</b> up a friendship and share a bond, this makes Mike jealous. Her relationship with Mike gradually {{comes to an end}} after he cheats on her. Amanda comes back to Erinsborough, under the ruse of getting to know her daughter when in reality she is hiding from being fined for insurance fraud. Jane and Nell eventually tell her to leave.|$|E

5|$|They {{continue}} spending afternoons on {{the beach}} where, {{in the midst of}} scantily-clad teenage girls, their thoughts invariably turn to sex. All of them are virgins: Oscy is obsessed with the act of sex, while Hermie finds himself developing romantic interest in the bride, whose husband he spots leaving the island on a water taxi one morning. Later that day, Hermie finds her trying to carry bags of groceries by herself, and helps get them back to her house. <b>They</b> <b>strike</b> up a friendship and he agrees to return to help her with chores.|$|E
5|$|United States Navy SEALs have {{distinguished}} {{themselves as}} an individually reliable, collectively disciplined and highly skilled special operations force. The most important trait that distinguishes Navy SEALs {{from all other}} military forces is that SEALs are maritime special operations, as <b>they</b> <b>strike</b> from {{and return to the}} sea. SEALs (SEa, Air, Land) take their name from the elements in and from which they operate. SEALs are experts in direct action and special reconnaissance missions. Their stealth and clandestine methods of operation allow them to conduct multiple missions against targets that larger forces cannot approach undetected. Because of the dangers inherent in their missions, prospective SEALs go through what is considered by many military experts to be the toughest training regime in the world.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium {{improves}} many {{physical properties}} when added as an alloying element to aluminium, copper (notably the alloy beryllium copper), iron and nickel. Beryllium does not form oxides {{until it reaches}} very high temperatures. Tools made of beryllium copper alloys are strong and hard and do not create sparks when <b>they</b> <b>strike</b> a steel surface. In structural applications, the combination of high flexural rigidity, thermal stability, thermal conductivity and low density (1.85 times that of water) make beryllium metal a desirable aerospace material for aircraft components, missiles, spacecraft, and satellites. Because of its low density and atomic mass, beryllium is relatively transparent to X-rays {{and other forms of}} ionizing radiation; therefore, it is the most common window material for X-ray equipment and components of particle detectors. The high thermal conductivities of beryllium and beryllium oxide have led to their use in thermal management applications.|$|E

5|$|The Pacific {{angelshark}} {{is primarily}} a visual hunter; experiments in nature show that <b>they</b> <b>strike</b> at fish-shaped targets without any electrical, chemical, vibrational, or behavioral cues. At night, they are guided by the bioluminescence of planktonic dinoflagellates and ostracods disturbed by moving prey. This species' visual system is attuned to the wavelengths of light emitted by these planktonic organisms, showing the importance of night hunting. Pacific angelsharks {{are more likely to}} strike at prey approaching from the front. It usually waits until the prey approaches to , as its attack is less accurate beyond this distance. The strike is a stereotyped behavior in which the shark presses the forward lobes of its pectoral fins against the bottom and thrusts its head upwards at up to a 90° angle. Its mouth forms a tube when opened, creating a suction force, while its jaws protude forward to secure the prey between sharp teeth. During the strike, the eyes roll backward into the head for protection. The strike is often completed in under a tenth of a second.|$|E
5|$|Composer Yoshihiro Ike infused {{the music}} with the sorrow {{borne by the}} karas, and the {{atmosphere}} conveyed by the background. Ike obliged the team's request for Japanese flavored music, and studied kabuki tunes accompanying actors as <b>they</b> <b>strike</b> their , a picturesque pose to establish their character. He planned to use taikos (Japanese drums) to further enhance the music, but felt the show had taken on an international outlook and discarded the notion. He wanted his music to match {{the quality of the}} show, and refrained from composing them until he had watched the pre-dubbed version of the first episode. He composed most of his music as he watched the pre-dubbed episodes to synchronize their tempo and dynamics with the action in the show. He chose Prague Symphony Orchestra to perform the main theme because he felt the background of their city and its people suited the character of Karas. Other departments also took extraordinary measures in producing the show. The sound crew procured a Nissan Skyline GT-R and recorded its engine noise for several runs. These were used for the tunnel chase scenes which involved a hand-drawn 1972–77 Skyline. The editing team took the additional step of editing cels post-voice recording to ensure lip movements were in synch with the voices. These extra work and the hybrid 2D-3D approach inflated the budget of the production to three times the usual amount spent on an original video animation.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{biosphere}} {{has significantly}} altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved , forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today. This change enabled {{the proliferation of}} aerobic organisms and, indirectly, {{the formation of the}} ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3. The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land. Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before <b>they</b> <b>strike</b> the surface, and moderating temperature. This last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18°C, in contrast to the current +15°C, and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|Immortal Throne {{features}} multiple additions and alterations over Titan Quest. The main addition {{is a new}} Mastery titled Dream Mastery: {{available to}} new players {{from the start of}} the main campaign, it is a magic-focused skill that relies on illusion and stasis effects to disrupt enemy groups. Among the abilities available are putting nearby enemies to sleep until they are hit by a weapon strike, turning enemies on each other, and effects which make enemies take damage when <b>they</b> <b>strike</b> the player or faster health and energy recovery. In addition to extra quests, new items and equipment are included. An additional item slot for the player character is reserved for Artifacts, charms crafted for the player by Enchanters after the player discovers enough Arcane Formulae after defeating enemies. Artifacts are divided into three levels (Lesser, Greater and Divine), which grant a variety of status effects depending on their level. A separate type of item are Scrolls, expendable items that produce powerful effects and can be equipped in a similar fashion to healing potions. Additional sellers and storage Caravans are included in between towns. Multiplayer functions return from the original game, while adding refinements such as the ability to automatically join parties and engage in player-versus-player matches.|$|E
25|$|In July 1948, {{a strike}} was averted {{at the last}} minute as the SAG and major {{producers}} agreed upon a new collective bargaining contract. The major points agreed upon included: full union shop for actors to continue, negotiations for films sent direct to TV, producers could not sue an actor for breach of contract if <b>they</b> <b>strike</b> (but the guild could only strike when the contract expires).|$|E
25|$|Hardcore wrestlers get {{momentum}} {{bonuses for}} using weapons. They can also perform grapple moves while holding a weapon. If {{they try to}} use a steel chair with full momentum, they automatically perform the Steel Chair DDT. If they are caused to bleed, they instantly get full momentum. Their special move can only be performed with a steel chair in hand. <b>They</b> <b>strike</b> themselves in the face repeated until they bleed. While this causes full momentum, it also causes critical head damage.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Dave Moss (Harris) and George Aaronow (Arkin) {{complain}} about Mitch and Murray, and Moss proposes that <b>they</b> <b>strike</b> {{back at the}} two by stealing all the Glengarry leads and selling them to a competing real estate agency. Moss's plan requires Aaronow {{to break into the}} office, stage a burglary and steal all of the prime leads. Aaronow wants no part of the plan, but Moss tries to coerce him, saying that Aaronow is already an accessory before the fact simply because he knows about the proposed burglary.|$|E
25|$|Pike {{are found}} in {{sluggish}} streams and shallow, weedy places in lakes, {{as well as in}} cold, clear, rocky waters. They are typical ambush predators; they lie in wait for prey, holding perfectly still for long periods, and then exhibit remarkable acceleration as <b>they</b> <b>strike.</b> In short, they inhabit any water body that contains fish, but suitable places for spawning are essential for their numbers. Because of their cannibalistic nature, young pike need places where they can take shelter between plants so they are not eaten. In both cases, rich submerged vegetation is needed. Pike are seldom found in brackish water, except for the Baltic Sea area. They seem to prefer water with less turbidity, but that is probably related to their dependence on the presence of vegetation and not to their being sight hunters.|$|E
25|$|The {{magnetic}} field {{is set to}} a value well below the critical, so the electrons follow arcing paths towards the anode. When <b>they</b> <b>strike</b> the anode, they cause it to become negatively charged in that region. As this process is random, some areas will become more or less charged than the areas around them. The anode is constructed of a highly conductive material, almost always copper, so these differences in voltage cause currents to appear to even them out. Since the current has to flow around {{the outside of the}} cavity, this process takes time. During that time additional electrons will avoid the hot spots and be deposited further along the anode, as the additional current flowing around it arrives too. This causes an oscillating current to form as the current tries to equalize one spot, then another.|$|E

25|$|Hiro Protagonist is {{a hacker}} and pizza {{delivery}} driver for the Mafia. He meets Y.T. (short for Yours Truly), a young skateboard Kourier (courier), during a {{failed attempt to}} make a delivery on time. Y.T. completes the delivery on his behalf and <b>they</b> <b>strike</b> up a partnership, gathering intel and selling it to the CIC, the for-profit organization that evolved from the CIA's merger with the Library of Congress. Within the Metaverse, Hiro is offered a datafile named Snow Crash {{by a man named}} Raven who hints that it is a form of narcotic. Hiro's friend and fellow hacker Da5id views a bitmap image contained in the file which causes his computer to crash and Da5id to suffer brain damage in the real world. Hiro meets his ex-girlfriend Juanita Marquez, who gives him a database containing a large amount of research, positing connections between the virus, ancient Sumerian culture and the legend of Tower of Babel. Juanita advises him to be careful and disappears.|$|E
25|$|A Farnsworth-Hirsch fusor {{consists}} of two wire cages, one inside the other, {{often referred to as}} grids, that are placed inside a vacuum chamber. The outer cage has a positive voltage versus the inner cage. Typically, deuterium gas is injected into this chamber. It is heated past its ionization temperature, making positive ions. The ions are positive and move towards the negative inner cage. Those that miss the wires of the inner cage fly {{through the center of the}} device at high speeds and can fly out the other side of the inner cage. As the ions move outward, they feel a Coulomb force that directs them back towards the center. Over time, a core of ionized gas can form inside the inner cage. Ions pass back and forth through the core until <b>they</b> <b>strike</b> either the grid or another nucleus. Most nucleus strikes do not result in fusion. Grid strikes can raise the temperature of the grid as well as eroding it. These strikes conduct mass and energy away from the plasma.|$|E
25|$|Photons {{hitting a}} thin film of alkali metal or {{semiconductor}} material such as gallium arsenide in an image intensifier tube cause the ejection of photoelectrons due to the photoelectric effect. These are accelerated by an electrostatic field where <b>they</b> <b>strike</b> a phosphor coated screen, converting the electrons back into photons. Intensification of the signal is achieved either through acceleration of the electrons or by {{increasing the number of}} electrons through secondary emissions, such as with a micro-channel plate. Sometimes a combination of both methods is used. Additional kinetic energy is required to move an electron out of the conduction band and into the vacuum level. This is known as the electron affinity of the photocathode and is another barrier to photoemission other than the forbidden band, explained by the band gap model. Some materials such as Gallium Arsenide have an effective electron affinity that is below the level of the conduction band. In these materials, electrons that move to the conduction band are all of sufficient energy to be emitted from the material and as such, the film that absorbs photons can be quite thick. These materials are known as negative electron affinity materials.|$|E
