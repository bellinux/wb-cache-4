60|$|At {{this point}} in Mrs. Browning's {{correspondence}} we reach the first allusion to the political crisis which had now become acute, and of which the letters that follow are full, almost to excess. On January 1 Napoleon had astounded Europe by his language to the Austrian ambassador at Paris, in which {{he spoke of the}} bad relations unfortunately subsisting between <b>their</b> <b>States.</b> <b>On</b> the 10th Victor Emmanuel declared that he must listen to the cry of pain which came up to him from all Italy. After this it was clear that {{there was nothing to do}} but to prepare for war. It was in vain that England pressed for a European Congress, with the view of arranging a general disarmament. Sardinia professed willingness to accept it, but Austria declined, and on April 23 sent an ultimatum to Victor Emmanuel, demanding unconditional disarmament, which was naturally refused. On the 29th Austria declared war, and her troops crossed the Ticino--an act which Napoleon had already announced would be considered as tantamount to a declaration of war with France.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{formulate}} {{and analyze}} an optimization-based Atomistic-to-Continuum (AtC) coupling method for problems with point defects. Near the defect core the method employs a potential-based atomistic model, which enables accurate simulation of the defect. Away from the core, where site energies become nearly inde-pendent of the lattice position, the method switches {{to a more}} efficient continuum model. The two models are merged by minimizing the mismatch of <b>their</b> <b>states</b> <b>on</b> an overlap region, subject to the atomistic and contin-uum force balance equations acting independently in their domains. We prove that the optimization problem is well-posed and establish error estimates...|$|E

40|$|This is {{an account}} of how the Cooperative Extension Services of four land-grant institutions—the University of Arkansas. Cornell University, Iowa State University, and Pennsylvania State University—undertook {{to educate the public}} of <b>their</b> <b>states</b> <b>on</b> some of the most {{important}} local problems. All four institutions have in common the traditions of the land-grant system; but the regions they serve differ greatly in economics, politics and cultural forms. All four states used the same method of reaching the public, with only minor adaptations to local circumstances. All achieved remarkable success. Thus in this venture these universities have not only served their states well but have added a new dimension to land-grant education, one that educators throughout the country may well find of interest.

40|$|This paper studies {{autonomous}} synchronization of k agent orientations in SO(n) {{by using}} links that each convey (a priori different) partial state information between two agents: the latter compare {{the action of}} <b>their</b> <b>states</b> <b>on</b> a common link-dependent vector of Rn. Such setting appears when each pair of agents compares the expression, in their respective body frames, of a common external direction (force field, heading of moving object, etc.). To synchronize their states, agents must combine this information over time or throughout the network. A gradient coupling law for synchronization is proposed. Extensive convergence analysis of the coupled agents is provided, both for fixed and time-varying reference vectors. The results are compared to a similar setting with states in Rn and agents coupled through scalar product of their state with a reference vector...|$|E
40|$|This paper studies {{autonomous}} synchronization of k agents whose states evolve on SO(n), {{but which}} are only coupled through {{the action of}} <b>their</b> <b>states</b> <b>on</b> one "reference vector" in Rn for each link. Thus each link conveys only partial state information at each time, and to reach synchronization agents must combine this information over time or throughout the network. A natural gradient coupling law for synchronization is proposed. Extensive convergence analysis of the coupled agents is provided, both for fixed and time-varying reference vectors. The case of SO(3) with fixed reference vectors is discussed in more detail. For comparison, we also treat the equivalent setting in Rn, i. e. with states in Rn and connected agents comparing scalar product of their states with a reference vector.
