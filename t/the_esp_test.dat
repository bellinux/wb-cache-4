40|$|The problem {{involved}} {{in this study was}} to determine the effects of two different training modalities upon the empathic skills of 42 undergraduate college students who had selected some helping profession as a career goal. An experimental design was developed wherein the 42 subjects were randomly assigned to two experimental groups and a control group. One experimental group was given 16 hours of didactic instructions in empathy skills, the other experimental group was subjected to 16 hours of training in meditation. The control group participated in music listening activities during the training period. Post-test empathy scores for the two experimental groups were compared to each other and to the control group. It was also posited that different interpersonal skills may exist within a single individual in comparable amounts. This probability led to efforts to determine the relationship between empathic ability and extra-sensory perception, which is the ability to perceive through other than the usually identified senses. To obtain the ESP scores the Zener ESP Test was administered to the three groups of subjects. The next step was to find the coefficients of correlation between the ESP scores and the empathy scores. The data of the study were analyzed in the following manner: 1. Group means were computed for the empathy test scores and ESP scores of the subjects. 2. A re-test reliability coefficient was computed for the empathy test scores of all subjects. 3. A randomized block analysis of variance was computed and the appropriate significance levels were determined. 4. The empathy test mean scores for each group were analyzed by the t-test of significance. 5. A Pearson Product Moment Correlation was computed for the empathy test scores and the ESP scores of each group independently. 6. A Pearson Product Moment Correlation was computed for the empathy test scores and the ESP scores of the total group. Findings Testing of the hypotheses of the study resulted in the following findings: 1. A t-ratio of. 66 with 13 degrees of freedom p 3 ̆e. 519 was not significant at the. 05 level when the mean empathy scores of the empathy group and the control group were compared. 2. A t-ratio of 2. 31 with 13 degrees of freedom and p 3 ̆e. 038 was significant at the. 05 level when the mean empathy scores of the meditation group and the control group were compared. 3. A t-ratio of. 88 with 13 degrees of freedom and p 3 ̆c. 395 was not significant at the. 05 level when the mean empathy scores of the meditation group and the empathy group were compared. 4. An F-ratio of 1. 338 was not significant at the. 05 level, for the empathy scores of the empathy, meditation, and control group. 5. An r of -. 06 with p 3 ̆e. 42 was not significant when the empathy scores and the ESP scores of the empathy group were correlated. 6. An r of -. 425 with p 3 ̆e. 065 was not significant when the empathy scores and the ESP scores of the meditation group were correlated. 7. An r of -. 51 with p 3 ̆c. 03 was significant when the empathy scores and the ESP scores of the control group were correlated. 8. An r of -. 37 with p 3 ̆c. 008 was significant when the empathy scores and the ESP scores of all subjects were correlated. Conclusions Within the limitations of the study the following conclusions may be drawn: 1. The null hypothesis of no significant difference between the empathy scores of the empathy group and the control group is accepted. Subjects trained in empathy did not earn significantly higher scores than subjects who did not receive training, 2. The null, hypothesis of no significant difference between the empathy scores of the meditation group and the control group is rejected. Meditation training indicates a trend toward influencing higher empathy performance for subjects trained in the technique, 3. The null hypothesis of no significant difference between the empathy scores of the empathy group and the control group is accepted. Empathy training did not have a significant effect on empathy scores. 4. The null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between the mean empathy scores of the empathy, meditation, and control group is accepted. There were no significant inter action effects of the total group of subjects. 5. The null hypothesis of no significant correlation between the empathy scores and the ESP scores of the empathy group is accepted. Subjects on the whole did not show similar levels of performance on the empathy test and <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> <b>test.</b> 6. The null hypothesis of no significant correlation between the empathy scores and the ESP scores of the meditation group is accepted. There is no relationship between the empathy test performance and <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> <b>test</b> performance of the subjects who received meditation training. 7. The null hypothesis of no significant correlation between the empathy test scores and <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> <b>test</b> scores of the control group is rejected. There is a positive relationship between the empathy test performance and <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> <b>test</b> performance of the subjects in the control group. 8. The null hypothesis of no significant correlation between the empathy test scores and <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> <b>test</b> scores of the empathy, meditation and control groups combined is rejected. There is a positive relationship between the empathy test performance and <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> <b>test</b> performance of the total group of subjects in the study...|$|E

Merely establishing a child's hearing threshold with and without a hearing aid is not sufficient to ensure an adequate evaluation with a view to selecting cases suitable for cochlear implants because it fails to indicate the real benefit obtained from using a conventional hearing aid reliably. Speech perception tests have proved useful not only for patient selection, but also for subsequent evaluation of the efficacy of new hearing aids, such as tactile devices and cochlear implants. In clinical practice, the tests most commonly adopted with small children are: The Auditory Comprehension Test (ACT), Discrimination after Training (DAT), Monosyllable, Trochee, Spondee tests (MTS), Glendonald Auditory Screening Priocedure (GASP), Early Speech Perception Test (ESP), Rather than considering specific results achieved in individual cases, reference is generally made to the four speech perception classes proposed by Moog and Geers of the CID of St. Louis. The purpose of this classification, made on the results obtained with suitably differentiated tests according to the child's age and language ability, is to detect differences in perception of a spoken message in ideal listening conditions. To date, no italian language speech perception test has been designed to establish the assessment of speech perception level in children with profound hearing impairment. We attempted, therefore, to adapt the existing English tests to the Italian language taking into consideration the differences between the two languages. Our attention focused on <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> <b>test</b> since it can be applied to even very small children (2 years old). The ESP is proposed in a standard version for hearing-impaired children over the age of 6 years and in a simplified version for younger children. The rationale we used for selecting Italian words reflect the rationale established for the original version, but the choice of single words follows different criteria from the original version. In fact, the two languages differ in important linguistic features so that the test can not be not adapted to the Italian language by simply translating the words involved. As currently there is no children's language dictionary in Italian arranged according to age bracket, we chose words used in children and in pre-school reading material...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the validity of an existing English test in order to examine its potential and shortcomings in assessing the engineering students' English ability. The test was built mainly to measure grammar and reading ability, while adopting recognition testing techniques. The focus on the validity event for the ESP reading test arose from the urgent need of the University of Tripoli, Libya as well as students' appeal for an improved English test, where thousands of students from different engineering departments at the faculty of engineering study English (ESL) as a compulsory course and take <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> <b>test</b> to carry on their academic study at the faculty. The current method of providing the English test to these students presents the university with some problems in terms of test design, construction, content, efficiency, reliability and validity. These are significant aspects for any validation process, and to date, they have not been addressed formally at the university. To achieve this, a framework for validating a reading test (Weir 2005) was adopted throughout the study. The framework is instructive and comprehensive in nature. It has five components and various parameters that ensure meaningful and typical test validity process in all test stages which include a 'priori', during and a 'posteriori' of the test event. The framework was operationalized such that data collection and analysis were conducted according to validity elements of the framework, and consequently all findings were systematically reported. The study involved three phases: a validation study on the Existing English Test (Ti), the development, administration and validation of a Sample Proposed ESP Test (T 2), and the report analysis of the two tests. Data gathered from the main validation study point to deficiencies found in the existing test such as test specifications, test format and content, test construction, rating process, and other administrative and evaluative issues. Through the sample proposed test (T 2) these issues were considered. The comparative validity report of the two ESP tests addressed the question of whether the use of an alternative test fulfills to some extent the requirements of a valid test, and students' needs for academic study and their future career. Recommendations were made for using systematic frameworks, such as that proposed by Weir (2005), to validate and improve language tests in which validity parameters are incorporated and further validation can subsequently be conducted...|$|E

Pearce was tested (using Zener cards) by Pratt, who shuffled and recorded {{the order of the}} cards in the parapsychology lab 100 yards from where Pearce was sitting in a campus library cubicle. The series comprised 37 25-trial runs, conducted between August 1933 and March 1934. From run to run, the number of matches between Pratt's cards and Pearce's guesses was highly variable, generally deviating significantly above-chance, but also falling dramatically below-chance. These scores were obtained irrespective of the distance between Pratt and Pearce, which was arranged as either 100 or 250 yards. In 1934, drawing upon several years of meticulous lab research and statistical analysis, Rhine published the first edition of a book titled Extra-Sensory Perception, which in various editions was widely read over the next decades. In the later 1930s, Rhine investigated [...] "psychokinesis" [...] - again reducing the subject to simple terms so that it could be tested, with controls, in a laboratory setting. Rhine relied on testing whether a subject could influence the outcome of tossed dice - initially with hand-thrown dice, later with dice thrown from a cup, and finally with machine-thrown dice.|$|R

40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 New {{emission}} legislation regarding {{air pollution}} control, as instructed by the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) to Eskom Generation Power Stations, implies a particulate emission limit of 100 mg/Nm 3 for all existing power stations by 2015 and 50 mg/Nm 3 for all new and existing power stations {{by the year}} 2020. Some of Eskom’s power stations which are equipped with Electrostatic Precipitators (ESP’s) were not designed for this stringent legislation.

Eskom {{is in the process of}} introducing various ESP enhancement projects to improve performance and aligning the operating philosophy to comply with the more stringent particulate emission legislation. An <b>ESP</b> efficiency <b>test</b> was conducted at Lethabo Power Station to determine the current state of the plant and performance. The results of the test were compared with the original design base specifications to determine the relevant deficiencies which contribute to high emissions and poor ESP performance.

The test case was originally proposed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for evaluation of Electronic Stability Programs (ESP) performance during an oversteer situation on high friction. The modified test case presented here accounts for the heavy vehicle dynamics through three main modifications of the original test case. Firstly, to avoid rollover, the test case is performed on low friction. Secondly, to avoid excess understeer behaviour, the steering input frequency is lowered compared to the original test. Thirdly, to account for response times, the responsiveness and stability criteria are modified. These modifications are derived from hardware in the loop simulations and field tests for different tractor/truck and trailer combinations. By using the modified responsiveness and stability criteria it was shown that <b>the</b> <b>tested</b> <b>ESP</b> system could be objectively evaluated.

With {{the development}} of oilfield exploration, the performance of electric submersible pump (ESP) has been enhanced very fast. It requires testing techniques develop at the same time. The most outstanding question is the testing of high temperature and pressure <b>ESP.</b> A <b>testing</b> well was drilled in Daqing in 1992. It keeps the water liquid state on 150 centigrade by high pressure. This system can simulate operational mode 3000 meters under the ground. But many new ESPs have been produced these years. The quondam testing system couldn’t meet the testing requirement. A new testing system is desiderated eagerly. This paper developed a high temperature and pressure <b>ESP</b> <b>testing</b> experimentation system. Hydraulic/thermodynamic analysis calculation has been carried on. Friction resistance from constant pressure point to the suction inlet of hot water pump and <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> in heating-forced cycle and experimentation primary cycle are calculated respectively. Keeping the water liquid state on 180 centigrade, constant pressure value was fixed on 2. 5 MPa. The heat load is calculated including the heat that {{the water in the}} system and the equipment need and the heat loss. In order to protect ESP from emanating too much heat to keep the temperature and pressure of the system steady, heat exchange system has been designed. Cold load and heat exchange square have been calculated. Friction resistance {{and the size of the}} cold water cistern have been calculated. These provide necessary academic foundation for the testing experimentation of high temperature and pressure ESP. ...|$|R

40|$|Rupert Sheldrake’s {{theory of}} morphic {{resonance}} suggests {{a means by}} which the thoughts or behaviours of physically isolated individuals may nevertheless converge {{in a manner that is}} reminiscent of <b>ESP,</b> and <b>tests</b> of <b>the</b> predictions of his theory have <b>the</b> appearance of <b>ESP</b> <b>tests</b> involving millions of potential senders. Empirical tests to date have been broadly consistent with the theory’s predictions, but evaluation of these findings may be stymied by the tendency for results to be reported in popular accounts rather than peer reviewed journal papers, so that essential methodological detail may not be available. In this study we sought to replicate earlier findings with word-based stimuli in a laboratory-based study that was intended to form part of the scientific record whatever the outcome. We also planned to extend the paradigm to consider individual differences in susceptibility to morphic resonance, and as a preliminary step looked at the effects of transliminality on performance. Sixty unselected participants were exposed to 10 stimuli consisting of 5 genuine Chinese characters and 5 false characters that were derived from genuine characters with the assistance of a native Chinese speaker in such a way as to appear authentic. Subsequently participants were asked to identify which characters they could recognize among a sheet of 20 that included all 10 that were originally presented intermixed with 10 decoys (also 5 real and 5 false). As predicted by the theory of morphic resonance, participants accurately recognized more of the genuine than false characters, t(59) = 2. 40, p =. 020, but also were more likely to report false memories (i. e. claim that they recognized items that were never presented) that were genuine characters than false ones, t(59) = 3. 805, p <. 001. These effects were not a function of presentation order. Participants’ transliminality scores were significantly related to their performance with presented characters (r =. 38, p =. 003) but not with decoy characters (r =. 14, p =. 28).

40|$|During the FY 1998 Saltcake Dissolution Workshop, {{participants}} identified nine {{tasks to}} be performed prior to the FY 1999 workshop. Discussions during the workshop indicated that significant progress was made in each area. The workshop focused on {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the Environmental Simulation Program (<b>ESP).</b> In addition, <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> predictions for <b>the</b> Tank SY- 101 remediation and <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> validation efforts were evaluated. Finally, the need for a broader user base was identified. At the request of the Tank Waste Remediation System (TWRS), <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> model was successfully utilized to predict the effects of Hanford tank farm operations such as waste transfers and water dilutions. <b>The</b> <b>ESP</b> model was originally developed to predict the compositions of solutions from off gas scrubbers. Therefore, the original database for <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> model was designed for use with solutions with low ionic strengths. However, the Hanford tanks contain waste with very high ionic strengths. TWRS and Tank Focus Area (TFA) staff members have measured the solubilities of key components at high ionic strengths. The results from these studies were used to develop the Hanford database for <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> model so <b>the</b> model could more accurately predict the compositions of Hanford waste streams with high ionic streams. The OLI Corporation, which developed <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> model, has now incorporated most of the Hanford database into its standard ESP database. Another deficiency of <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> model involves <b>the</b> lack of detailed documentation. Most new users of <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> model normally encounter several obstacles. Therefore, TWRS management has proposed the development of an ESP user guide based on the experiences of TWRS and TFA researchers. The objective of the user guide is to make <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> model more user friendly for the Hanford process engineers. The saltcake dissolution experiments at Hanford and the SOLGAS calculations at Oak Ridge are critically in the validation of <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> model. Due to the high costs associated with the experiments with actual waste, the TWRS would prefer to use <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> model to predict the effects of most tank farm operations. A comparison of <b>the</b> SOLGAS and <b>ESP</b> calculations indicated that the models were not in good agreement at most of the hydroxide concentration. The SOLGAS model uses the Gibbs free energy of formation to determine the solubilities of the chemical constituents while <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> uses <b>the</b> KFIT subroutine. The agreement between <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> and SOLGAS predictions improved when <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> calculations were based on thermodynamic functions. TPA researchers will contact OLI Corporation to determine the experimental results needed to improve the fit. In addition, a high ionic strength model, which was developed by Moonis Ally of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, will be used to validate <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> model. One of the new points of emphasis involves the need for the TPA researchers to work with a wider range of users at the Hanford site. Most of the previous TFA and users interactions involved the engineering group, which is responsible for the initial remediation of Tank SY- 101.

Detroit, Mich.) was compared with two manual aerobic blood culture systems, the Isolator (Wampole Laboratories, Cranbury, N. J.) and the Septi-Chek (Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, Md.) systems, {{for the detection}} of bloodstream microorganisms from 5, 845 blood samples for culture collected from adult patients with suspected septicemia. The bottles were incubated for 7 days, and the sediment from the Isolator tube was inoculated onto solid medium and this medium was incubated for 72 h. A total of 609 microorganisms were recovered from 546 blood cultures. There was no statistically significant difference in the total recovery of microorganisms for <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> 80 A system when compared with that for the Septi-Chek system (P = 0. 083); however, the Isolator system recovered significantly more microorganisms overall than either <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> 80 A (P < 0. 001) or the Septi-Chek (P < 0. 001) system. When assessing individual probable pathogens, the Isolator system detected statistically significantly more Staphylococcus aureus and Candida spp. than either <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> 80 A or the Septi-Chek system (P < 0. 05). Similarly, the Isolator system detected statistically significantly more bloodstream infections (septic episodes) caused by S. aureus and Candida spp. than either <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> 80 A or the Septi-Chek system (P < 0. 05). In blood culture sets which produced growth of the same probable pathogens in <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> 80 A and the Isolator systems, there was no statistically significant difference in the median times to detection for all pathogens combined (P = 0. 067). However, a similar comparison showed the Isolator and <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> 80 A systems to have statistically significantly shorter median detection times for all pathogens combined (P < 0. 001) when they were independently compared with the Septi-Chek system. <b>The</b> <b>ESP</b> 80 A system had 29 (0. 5 %) false-positive signals. <b>The</b> <b>ESP</b> system required less processing time than the Isolator system and eliminates the hands-on time {{for the detection of}} positive cultures required by the manual systems...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to limited}} tank space at Hanford and Savannah River, the liquid nuclear wastes or supernatants have been {{concentrated}} in evaporators to remove excess water {{prior to the}} hot solutions being transferred to underground storage tanks. As the waste solutions cooled, the salts in the waste exceeded the associated solubility limits and precipitated {{in the form of}} saltcakes. The initial step in the remediation of these saltcakes is a rehydration process called saltcake dissolution. At Hanford, dissolution experiments have been conducted on small saltcake samples from five tanks. Modeling of these experimental results, using the Environmental Simulation Program (ESP), are being performed at the Diagnostic Instrumentation and Analysis Laboratory (DIAL) at Mississippi State University. The River Protection Project (RPP) at Hanford will use these experimental and theoretical results to determine the amount of water that will be needed for its dissolution and retrieval operations. A comprehensive effort by the RPP and the Tank Focus Area continues to validate and improve <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> and its databases for this application. The initial effort focused on the sodium, fluoride, and phosphate system due to its role in the formation of pipeline plugs. In FY 1999, an evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> predictions for sodium fluoride, trisodium phosphate dodecahydrate, and natrophosphate clearly indicated that improvements to the Public database of <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> were needed. One of the improvements identified was double salts. The inability of any equilibrium thermodynamic model to properly account for double salts in the system can result in errors in the predicted solid-liquid equilibria (SLE) of species in <b>the</b> system. <b>The</b> <b>ESP</b> code is evaluated by comparison with experimental data where possible. However, data does not cover the range of component concentrations and temperatures found in many tank wastes. Therefore, comparison of ESP with another code is desirable, and may illuminate problems with both. For this purpose, the SOLGASMIX code was used in conjunction with a small private database developed at ORNL. This code calculates thermodynamic equilibria through minimization of Gibbs Energy, and utilizes the Pitzer model for activity coefficients. The sodium nitrate-sulfate double salt and the sodium fluoride-sulfate double salt were selected for the FY 2000 validation study of ESP. Even though ESP does not include the sulfate-nitrate double salt, this study found that this omission {{does not appear to be}} a major consequence. In this case, the solubility predictions with and without the sulfate-nitrate double salt are comparable. In contrast, even though the sulfate-fluoride double salt is included within <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> databank, comparison to previous experimental results indicates that ESP underestimates solubility. Thus, the prediction for the sulfate-fluoride system needs to be improved. A main consequence of the inability to accurately predict the SLE of double salts is its impact on the predicted ionic strength of the solution. The ionic strength has been observed to be an important factor in the formation of pipeline plugs. To improve <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> prediction, solubility <b>tests</b> on the sulfate-fluoride system are underway at DIAL, and these experimental results will be incorporated into the Public database by OLI System, Inc. Preliminary ESP simulations also indicated difficulties with the SLE prediction for anhydrous sodium sulfate. The Public database for <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> does not include fundamental parameters for this solid in mixed solutions below 32. 4 C. The limitation, in the range of anhydrous sodium sulfate, leads to convergence problems in ESP and to inaccurate predictions of solubility near the invariant point when sodium sulfate decahydrate and other salts, such as sodium nitrate, were present. These difficulties were partially corrected through the use of an additional database. In conclusion, these results indicate the need for experimental data at temperatures above 25 C and in solutions containing both nitrate and hydroxide. Furthermore, the validation and documentation of different ESP input data sets is still a crucial need. With judicious use, ESP can still provide valuable guidance for water processing operations. However, this study has identified several improvements and corrections, which could be implemented immediately...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — One of the {{applications}} of <b>the</b> electrostatic pre-cipitator (<b>ESP)</b> is <b>the</b> cleaning of air {{to increase the}} visibility index in highway tunnels. Particles floating in air in highway tunnels are mainly carbon. Collection efficiency of a large particle diameter in an ESP often decreases when <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> collects carbon particles which have low electric resistance. Collection efficiency often becomes negative in an experimental <b>ESP.</b> <b>The</b> negative collection efficiency means that the particle concentration flowing downstream is greater than that upstream in <b>the</b> <b>ESP.</b> This phenomenon is explained as the re-entrainment of particles. In this paper, experiments were carried out to investigate {{the cause of the}} decrease in efficiency of particle collection of <b>the</b> <b>ESP.</b> <b>The</b> time characteristic of the collection efficiency and the distribution of particle size on the collection electrodes were studied. Experimental results showed that the decrease in the collection efficiency was caused by re-entrainment of particles during <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> operation. <b>The</b> effect of gas-flow velocity on the collection efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>ESP</b> was also investigated to study the cause of re-entrainment phenomena. The result showed that the re-entrainment phenomena depended on the gas-flow velocity. Index Terms—Diesel exhaust particles, electrostatic precipita-tor, highway tunnel, re-entrainment. I...|$|R
