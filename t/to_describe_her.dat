Catherine christened it the Hermitage (14), a name used by her predecessor Tsaritsa Elizabeth <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>her</b> private rooms within the palace.|$|E

25|$|Although on {{her return}} to Vienna in August 1862, a lady-in-waiting {{reported}} that “she eats properly, sleeps well, and does not tight-lace any more”, her clothing from this time until her death still measured only 18 1/2 – 19 1/2inches around the waist, which prompted the Prince of Hesse <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>her</b> as “almost inhumanly slender.” She developed a horror of fat women and transmitted this attitude to her youngest daughter, who was terrified when, as a little girl, she first met Queen Victoria.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} lack of anecdotal devices, the {{painting}} is unusual in other ways. Bathsheba is presented in a space that is difficult to read. The dark background is suggestive of night, while a massive column implies a large architectural structure. Behind her lies a passage of richly painted drapery composed of browns and ochers that impart a golden warmth. Around her rests a thickly painted background of white chemise; set against this her naked flesh stands out for its solid form and the sumptuous application of paint. The paint used <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>her</b> figure is richly nuanced, its broad brushstrokes and strong highlights impart a vibrant tactile quality to the body, rendering her presence palpable.|$|E

2500|$|Anne {{is highly}} imaginative, {{eager to please}} and quite {{dramatic}} at times. [...] However, she is defensive about her appearance, despising her red hair and pale, thin frame. She is often quite talkative, {{especially when it comes}} <b>to</b> <b>describing</b> <b>her</b> fantasies and dreams. At first, stern and sharp Marilla says Anne must return to the orphanage, but after much observation and considering, along with Matthew's strong liking to Anne, she decides to let her stay.|$|R
25|$|Imonida, {{the love}} of Oroonoko’s life, is a {{beautiful}} African woman who is sold into slavery after Oroonoko attempts to rescue her. When Oroonoko meets Imonida, they instantly fall in love. His first encounter with her is described as, “a beauty, that <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>her</b> truly she was female to the noble male, the beautiful black Venus to our young Mars, as charming in her person as he, and of delicate virtues” (Behn, 9). Oroonoko is smitten by her, instantly asks her for her hand in marriage, and without hesitation she agrees. Although the African tradition of having more than one wife is still prevalent during this time, Oroonoko assures Imonida that he will never take on another wife. It {{is evident in the}} novella that Oroonoko and Imonida’s love for one another is unconditional. Once the King, Oroonoko’s grandfather, hears different rumors of how beautiful Imoinda is, he becomes adamant on making her one of his women. Despite his grandson’s deep affection and love for Imonida, the King gives her a royal veil which officially marks Imoinda as one of the King’s women. This is an honor that is nearly impossible to refuse and Oroonoko is angered by his grandfather’s actions. Imonida becomes a vital character by becoming the heart and center of this tragic travel narrative alongside Oroonko. Her beauty, strength, and flawless characteristics attract Oroonoko, the King, and even the reader for that matter. Oroonoko and Imoinda were constantly being separated once Imoinda gets sold into slavery. Regardless of how long they were a part, their love remained strong and eventually they are reunited. This never ending love between Oroonoko and Imoinda is evident throughout the novella. Both characters are willing to announce their love, make brutal sacrifices, and remain passionate for one another which helps solidify the strength of their unconditional love.|$|E
500|$|Monroe {{continued}} {{to attract attention}} with her revealing outfits in publicity events, most famously at the Photoplay awards in January 1953, where she won the [...] "Fastest Rising Star" [...] award. She wore a skin-tight gold lamé dress, which prompted veteran star Joan Crawford <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>her</b> behavior as [...] "unbecoming an actress and a lady" [...] to the press.|$|E
500|$|The WSPU {{were quick}} <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>her</b> as a martyr, {{part of a}} {{campaign}} to identify her as such. The Suffragette newspaper marked Davison's death by issuing a copy showing a female angel with raised arms {{standing in front of}} the guard rail of a racecourse. The paper's editorial stated that [...] "Davison has proved that there are in the twentieth century people who are willing to lay down their lives for an ideal". Religious phraseology was used in the issue <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>her</b> act, including [...] "Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends", which Gullickson reports as being repeated several times in subsequent discussions of the events. A year after the Derby, The Suffragette included [...] "The Price of Liberty", an essay by Davison. In it, she had written [...] "To lay down life for friends, that is glorious, selfless, inspiring! But to re-enact the tragedy of Calvary for generations yet unborn, that is the last consummate sacrifice of the Militant".|$|E

But Catherine claimed that she was unable <b>to,</b> <b>describing</b> <b>her</b> inability <b>to</b> eat as an infermità (illness). From the beginning of 1380, Catherine could neither eat nor swallow water. On February 26 she lost the use of her legs.|$|R

500|$|Bush has a {{dramatic}} soprano vocal range. Her vocals contain elements of British, Anglo-Irish and most prominently (southern) English accents and, in its utilisation of musical instruments from many periods and cultures, her music has differed from American pop norms. Reviewers {{have used the}} term [...] "surreal" [...] <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>her</b> music. Many of her songs explore melodramatic emotional and musical surrealism that defies easy categorisation. It has been observed that even her more joyous pieces are often tinged with traces of melancholy, {{and even the most}} sorrowful pieces have elements of vitality struggling against all that would oppress them.|$|E
500|$|The {{characterization}} of Orrec and Gry was well received. A review in Horn Book Magazine {{stated that the}} twain were [...] "unique, thoughtful young rebels". Their struggles were described as having philosophical aspects that nonetheless did not dominate the story. The review used Le Guin's own words <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>her</b> prose, writing that she [...] "talked like a little stream running, clearly and merrily, with the Lowland softness and fluency." [...] Cadden, writing in 2006, stated that the characters were drawn in a manner relevant to young adults, {{and that it was}} Le Guin's most satisfying work of young adult fiction. Another reviewer said that Gifts had the [...] "earthy magic and intelligent plot twists" [...] of the Earthsea Cycle, and that the book was a [...] "gift in the purest sense." ...|$|E
500|$|Written {{in the key}} of G major, [...] "Hot n Cold" [...] is a pop and dance-pop song which {{utilizes}} {{guitars and}} synthesizers. It has a length of three minutes and forty seconds (3:40), and runs at a moderately fast tempo of 132 beats per minute. The lyrics of the song address a lover of Perry whose mood swings are affecting the couple's relationship. The song opens with Perry confronting her former partner over his frequent changes of mind, singing [...] "You change your mind like a girl changes clothes / Yeah you PMS like a bitch". In the chorus, she uses antonyms <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>her</b> partner's mood changes, with the chorus of the song including the lines [...] "You're hot then you're cold / You're yes then you're no / You're in then you're out / You're up then you're down".|$|E

500|$|No Doubt {{decided to}} work with hip hop {{production}} duo The Neptunes {{as a sort of}} [...] "cultural collision". [...] Lead singer Gwen Stefani wanted to write a high-spirited and celebratory song about the positive things in her life, so they wrote an optimistic club song. [...] The word [...] was a slang term used mostly in the San Francisco Bay Area and other parts of California to mean [...] "very". [...] Having toured in the Bay Area, Stefani borrowed the term <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>her</b> mood. [...] Stefani wanted to use the word dance in a chorus, so she decided to end each line of [...] "Hella Good"'s chorus with the phrase [...] "keep on dancing". [...] The song's funk sound is based on songs such as Queen's 1980 single [...] "Another One Bites the Dust" [...] and The Commodores' 1977 single [...] "Brick House".|$|E
500|$|... "1+1" [...] {{begins with}} a low {{fidelity}} indie rock arrangement which is brought about by distorted guitar arpeggios and a discreet pipe organ. Beyoncé sings a meandering melody as she alternately references the pleasures of love and sex. Using simple arithmetic <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>her</b> undying love for her partner, she begins the first verse as she affirms to her romantic interest {{that the only thing}} she is sure about is her feelings for him, [...] "I don't know much about algebra, but I know that one plus one equals two ... If I ain't got something, I don't give a damn / 'Cause I got it with you". In the pre-chorus lines, Beyoncé expresses her reliance on her man without whom she believes to be incomplete as she sings, [...] "And it's me and you, that's all we'll have when the world is through / Because baby we ain't got nothing without love / Darling, you got enough love for the both of us".|$|E
500|$|In 1930, George V {{gave the}} prince the lease of Fort Belvedere in Windsor Great Park. There, he {{continued}} his relationships {{with a series of}} married women, including Freda Dudley Ward and Lady Furness, the American wife of a British peer, who introduced the prince to her friend and fellow American Wallis Simpson. Simpson had divorced her first husband, U.S. naval officer Win Spencer, in 1927. [...] Her second husband, Ernest Simpson, was a British-American businessman. Wallis Simpson and the Prince of Wales, it is generally accepted, became lovers, while Lady Furness travelled abroad, although the prince adamantly insisted to his father that he was not having an affair with her and that it was not appropriate <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>her</b> as his mistress. Edward's relationship with Simpson, however, further weakened his poor relationship with his father. Although King George V and Queen Mary met Simpson at Buckingham Palace in 1935, they later refused to receive her.|$|E

500|$|Among modern scholars, Sappho's {{sexuality}} is still debated – André Lardinois has {{described it as}} the [...] "Great Sappho Question". [...] Early translators of Sappho sometimes heterosexualised her poetry. Ambrose Philips' 1711 translation of the Ode to Aphrodite portrayed the object of Sappho's desire as male, a reading which was followed by virtually every other translator of the poem until the twentieth century, while in 1781 Alessandro Verri interpreted fragment 31 as being about Sappho's love for Phaon. [...] Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker argued that Sappho's feelings for other women were [...] "entirely idealistic and non-sensual", while Karl Otfried Müller wrote that fragment 31 described [...] "nothing but a friendly affection": Glenn Most comments that [...] "one wonders what language Sappho would have used <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>her</b> feelings {{if they had been}} ones of sexual excitement" [...] if this theory were correct. [...] By 1970, it would be argued that the same poem contained [...] "proof positive of [...] lesbianism".|$|E
500|$|Christine A. Colón and Bonnie E. Field, two {{single women}} in their thirties, {{expressed}} their frustrations with the Ludys' book in Singled Out: Why Celibacy Must Be Reinvented in Today's Church. Colón, an English professor at Wheaton College; and Field, a former English professor at Wayland Baptist University, criticize Leslie Ludy's account of her own wait for God to bring her a romantic partner. They argue that [...] "the language Ludy uses <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>her</b> time of waiting and trusting implies a difficult and long struggle that is finally rewarded by God" [...] and suggests that a long wait results in an even greater reward, a concept that Colón and Field, despite acknowledging as commonplace, disagree with and trace back to William Shakespeare's Cymbeline, which states [...] "the more delay'd, delighted." [...] Singled Out suggests that, because Leslie was only 16 when she met Eric, her story is unlikely to inspire hope in older singles.|$|E
500|$|Makeba was {{described}} as a style icon, both in her home country and the US. She wore no makeup and refused to straighten her hair for shows, thus helping establish a style that came to be known internationally as the [...] "Afro look". According to Music scholar Tanisha Ford, her hairstyle represented a [...] "liberated African beauty aesthetic". She was seen as a beauty icon by South African schoolgirls, who were compelled to shorten their hair by the apartheid government. Makeba stuck to wearing African jewellery; she disapproved of the skin-lighteners common among South African women at the time, and refused to appear in advertisements for them. Her self-presentation has been characterised by scholars as a rejection of the predominantly white standards of beauty that women in the US were held to, which allowed Makeba to partially escape the sexualisation directed at women performers during this period. Nonetheless, the terms used <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>her</b> in the US media have been identified by scholars as frequently used to [...] "sexualize, infantalize, and animalize" [...] people of African heritage.|$|E
