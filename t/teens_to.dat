5|$|As {{predicted}} {{through the}} actions of the boys in the film, there were numerous news reports of underage South Park fans engaging in unsuccessful attempts to gain entrance to the film at theaters. There were reports of adolescents purchasing tickets for WB's own Wild Wild West and instead sitting in to see South Park. This came {{as a result of a}} movie-industry crackdown that would make it tougher for children to sneak into R-rated films, as proposed by President Bill Clinton at the time in response to the moral panic generated by the Columbine High School massacre, which occurred two months before the film's release. South Park was cited, along with American Pie, as an explicit film released in the summer of 1999 tempting <b>teens</b> <b>to</b> sneak into theaters. When the film was released in the United Kingdom in August 1999, there were similar reports of the film drawing an underage crowd.|$|E

25|$|Secondly, {{excavations}} of Neferefre's pyramid {{have yielded}} his mummy, {{which showed that}} he was 18 to 20 {{years old at the}} death of Neferirkare. Consequently, as the previous king's eldest son, in his late <b>teens</b> <b>to</b> early twenties, Neferefre was in optimal position to ascend the throne.

25|$|Scientists {{have for}} a long time been {{interested}} in the relationship between testosterone and aggressive behavior. In most species, males are more aggressive than females. Castration of males usually has a pacifying effect on aggressive behavior in males. In humans, males engage in crime and especially violent crime more than females. The involvement in crime usually rises in the early <b>teens</b> <b>to</b> mid teens which happen {{at the same time as}} testosterone levels rise. Research on the relationship between testosterone and aggression is difficult since the only reliable measurement of brain testosterone is by a lumbar puncture which is not done for research purposes. Studies therefore have often instead used more unreliable measurements from blood or saliva.|$|E
