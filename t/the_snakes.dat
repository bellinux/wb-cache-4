5|$|After {{witnessing}} California-based gang boss Eddie Kim brutally beat U.S. Prosecutor Daniel Hayes {{to death}} in Hawaii, Sean Jones is escorted by FBI agents Neville Flynn and John Sanders on a Boeing 747-400 to testify in a trial in Los Angeles. Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a time-release crate full of venomous snakes {{to be placed in}} the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). To ensure <b>the</b> <b>snakes</b> attack the passengers without the need for provocation, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' leis with a special pheromone which makes <b>the</b> <b>snakes</b> highly aggressive. The crate opens midway through the flight and <b>the</b> <b>snakes</b> make their way through the cabin. A couple having sex in a bathroom, and a man using another bathroom are the first killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates and fixes an electrical short, but is killed by the viper that caused it. Co-pilot Rick, unaware of the snake, believes Sam has suffered a heart attack and continues toward LAX.|$|E

5|$|Snakes {{use their}} venom {{to kill or}} subdue prey, {{as well as for}} other diet-related functions, such as digestion.

5|$|Some of <b>the</b> <b>snakes</b> attack Rick, {{and while}} fending them off he accidentally {{releases}} the oxygen masks throughout the plane, causing several snakes to {{drop into the}} cabin with them. Numerous passengers, including Agent Sanders, are killed when <b>the</b> <b>snakes</b> invade the cabin. The surviving passengers, who have {{made their way to}} the front of the plane, put up blockades of luggage in a desperate attempt to stop <b>the</b> <b>snakes.</b> Rick is attacked and the plane starts to dip downwards, causing a food trolley to crash through the luggage blockade. The passengers flee to the upstairs first class cabin before blocking the stairwell with an inflatable liferaft. Agent Flynn and Flight Attendant Claire regain control of the plane. Rick retakes the controls and has Flynn go into the cargo hold to restore the air conditioning/ventilation system. Agent Flynn contacts FBI Special Agent Hank Harris on the ground, who gets in touch with ophiologist Dr. Steven Price, Customs' main source for animal smuggling cases. Based on pictures of the reptiles emailed to him via a passenger's mobile phone, Price believes a Los Angeles snake dealer known for illegally importing exotic and highly dangerous snakes to be responsible. After a shootout, the dealer is bitten by one of his snakes and Harris withholds the antivenom if he does not give them details. The dealer finally reveals that Kim hired him to obtain <b>the</b> <b>snakes</b> and adds how the latter managed to smuggle them on board the plane. Price injects antivenom to the injured dealer and he commandeers the dealer's supply of antivenom for the plane's victims based on the list given to him, while Harris gives orders to have Eddie Kim arrested on multiple counts of murder and attempted murder.|$|E
5|$|Spielberg used doves for the seagulls that Henry scares into {{striking}} the German plane because the real gulls {{used in the}} first take did not fly. In December 1988, Lucasfilm ordered 1,000 disease-free gray rats for the catacombs scenes from the company that supplied <b>the</b> <b>snakes</b> and bugs for the previous films. Within five months, 5,000 rats had been bred for the sequence; 1,000 mechanical rats stood in for those that were set on fire. Several thousand snakes of five breeds—including a boa constrictor—were used for the train scene, in addition to rubber ones onto which Phoenix could fall. <b>The</b> <b>snakes</b> would slither from their crates, requiring the crew to dig through sawdust after filming to find and return them.

5|$|There {{are fewer}} {{recorded}} bites from this species {{compared to other}} venomous species such as cobras and vipers as it is less aggressive and tends to avoid humans.

5|$|Southwest of {{the city}} of Rexburg, <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> {{receives}} from <b>the</b> right the Henrys Fork, sometimes called the North Fork of <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River. <b>The</b> confluence with the Henrys Fork takes the river southwards through downtown Idaho Falls, rounding the Fort Hall Indian Reservation and into American Falls Reservoir, receiving the Portneuf River. The Portneuf River Valley is an overflow channel that in the last glacial period carried floodwaters from pluvial Lake Bonneville into <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River Plain, carving out many topographic features and significantly altering <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River landscape. <b>The</b> <b>Snake</b> River resumes its journey westwards, then enters <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River Canyon of Idaho, where it drops over Shoshone Falls, a waterfall that marks the historical upriver limit of migrating salmon, and passing under the Perrine Bridge.

5|$|When a male detects a female, it chases {{the female}} and begins courtship. Females are larger and slower than males, and many males will escort and intertwine around a single female.

Furthermore, several of the cast and crew members had a fear of snakes, including Manners, David Duchovny, and John Shiban. During one of the days that the show was being prepped, a snake wrangler brought several live rattlesnakes to the set, but one escaped. It was eventually found behind Manners' desk.

40|$|Beginning at 1838 h on 30 May 2014 at the Caves Branch Jungle Lodge in Belize, we {{observed}} an encounter between a Leptodeira septentrionalis and an Incilius valliceps {{that appeared to}} have initiated as a predation attempt by the toad on <b>the</b> <b>snake.</b> <b>The</b> toad (SVL ca. 9 cm) had the dorsal portion of <b>the</b> <b>snake’s</b> head in its mouth (Fig. 1); however, the toad was motionless and <b>the</b> <b>snake</b> (with its head in the toad’s mouth) was retracting backwards up a stone wall into a crevice, pulling the toad with it. <b>The</b> <b>snake’s</b> lower jaw was beneath the lower jaw of the toad, meaning that teeth of <b>the</b> <b>snake’s</b> upper jaw were undoubtedly imbedded in the toad’s lower mouth, thereby allowing <b>the</b> <b>snake</b> to envenom <b>the</b> toad, indicated by the toad’s lack of motion (for information on toxicity of venom within motion to simultaneously extract its head from the immobilized toad and put the toad’s snout in its mouth. It then began an attempt to swallow the toad (Fig. 2). To do so <b>the</b> <b>snake</b> gradually began to exit the crevice and stretch downwards. By 1941 h, <b>the</b> <b>snake</b> had engulfed nearly the whole head of the toad. The next morning the toad was found dead about 2 m from where the encounter was first observed. There was no indication of the fate of <b>the</b> <b>snake.</b> Our only explanation for the encounter was that the toad attempted to predate <b>the</b> <b>snake,</b> but <b>the</b> <b>snake</b> was able to bite inside the toad’s mouth to envenom and kill the toad.

5|$|In {{locations}} where both snake and salamander co-exist, <b>the</b> <b>snakes</b> have developed immunity through genetic changes and they {{feed on the}} amphibians with impunity. Coevolution occurs with the newt increasing its toxic capabilities {{at the same rate}} as the snake further develops its immunity. Some frogs and toads are toxic, the main poison glands being at the side of the neck and under the warts on the back. These regions are presented to the attacking animal and their secretions may be foul-tasting or cause various physical or neurological symptoms. Altogether, over 200 toxins have been isolated from the limited number of amphibian species that have been investigated.|$|E
5|$|Most {{amphibians}} today remain semiaquatic, {{living the}} first stage of their lives as fish-like tadpoles. Several groups of tetrapods, such as <b>the</b> <b>snakes</b> and cetaceans, have lost some or all of their limbs. In addition, many tetrapods have returned to partially aquatic or fully aquatic lives throughout the history of the group (modern examples of fully aquatic tetrapods include cetaceans and sirenians). The first returns to an aquatic lifestyle may have occurred as early as the Carboniferous Period whereas other returns occurred as recently as the Cenozoic, as in cetaceans, pinnipeds, and several modern amphibians.|$|E
5|$|Sea snakes are {{generally}} reluctant to bite, {{and are usually}} considered to be mild-tempered, although variation is seen among species and individuals. Some species, such as P. platurus, which feed by simply gulping down their prey, {{are more likely to}} bite when provoked because they seem to use their venom more for defense. Others, such as Laticauda, use their venom for prey immobilization; these snakes are often handled without concern by local fishermen, who unravel and toss them back into the water barehanded when <b>the</b> <b>snakes</b> become entangled in fishing nets.
