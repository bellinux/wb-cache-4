Tammi tries to talk Randall out of it but Randall shoots through <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>next</b> to her and kills Dwight. Randall is eventually arrested, but Tammi successfully manages to run away.|$|E
5|$|The {{entirety}} of the church's interior {{is covered with}} 14th-century frescoes, which are described as “particularly remarkable” in a UNESCO publication. Among the notable mural portraits is that of church patron Saint Peter, whose larger-than-life image adorns <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>next</b> to the iconostasis. Other frescoes include that of Jesus Christ painted {{to the right of}} the apse and that of Saint Alexius next to the entrance. The middle reaches of the walls feature images from the Holy Week, with frescoes depicting events from other major holidays above them. The conch of the apse boasts an image of the Mother of God; portraits of various saints and scenes from the Ascension of Jesus and the Annunciation complete the decoration of the apse.|$|E

These spring-operated balancing mechanisms also typically permit the top of the windows to swing inward, permitting cleaning of the exterior of the IG window from inside the building.|$|E

The statue of a girl with a bucket situated {{in the area of the}} Slovak Primary School is the work of the sculptor J. V. Huck. The houses made from extruded bricks with a walled gable under the thatched roof date back to 19th century. Several of these houses have been preserved today.|$|E
25|$|CaixaForum Madrid is a post-modern {{art gallery}} in {{the centre of}} Madrid. It is {{sponsored}} by the Catalan-Balearic bank La Caixa and located next to the Salón del Prado. Although the CaixaForum is a modern building, it also exhibits retrospectives of artists from earlier time periods and has evolved into one of the most-visited museums in Madrid. It was constructed by the Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron from 2001 to 2007, who took an unused industrial building and hollowed it out at the base and inside and then added additional floors encased with rusted steel. Next to the gallery is an art installation by French botanist Patrick Blanc of green plants growing {{on the wall of the}} neighbouring house. The red of the top floors with the green of <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>next</b> to it form a contrast. The green is in reflection of the neighbouring Royal Botanical Garden.|$|E
25|$|One of the rioters {{sat in the}} Speaker's chair where Morin {{had been}} sitting {{only a few minutes}} before, and {{declared}} the dissolution of the House. The room was turned upside down while other men entered the room of the Legislative Council. The acts of vandalism that were reported included the destruction of the seats and desks, stamping on the portrait of Louis-Joseph Papineau, that had been hanging on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>next</b> to that of Queen Victoria. Perry claimed to have set fire to the room himself when he hit the gas chandelier suspended on the ceiling with a brick, aiming for the clock that was directly above the Speaker's chair. The clock, whose ticking apparently got on his nerves, was, according to his account, showing 9:40pm when it happened. Other sources, including newspapers of the time, believed the fire to have been started when rioters outside the building started throwing the torches that some of them had carried from the Champ-de-Mars meeting.|$|E

None of her other co-workers show, leaving her feeling alienated and sad. Roy comes by and compliments her work, but obviously does so as a [...] "boyfriend's gesture" [...] with no sincere appreciation for art. The general attendees show little interest in her drawings, and she begins to doubt her abilities. As she begins to take her work down, Michael arrives, having been delayed by the trip {{back to the office}} to move Ryan's things. He expresses sincere awe for her work and asks to buy her drawing of the office building. Pam embraces him as her eyes tear up.

60|$|Mary {{used that}} short time well. She {{knew exactly what}} to do. Darting into her chamber, she seized {{the end of the}} rope {{connected}} with the tank and pulled it violently.

60|$|Thinking {{the matter}} over, Mrs. Conway {{had come to}} the {{conclusion}} that the hiding-place could only be under one of the stone flags of the floor or in the wall against the fireplace, or rather in that part of it above the fireplace. There would not be thickness enough in the walls separating the secret chamber from the passage or the rooms on either side of it; but the chimney would not be of the same width as the open fireplace below, and there might well be a space there sufficient for a good-sized closet. It was here, therefore, that she determined to begin her search. The next night, then, after touching the springs and entering the secret chamber, she began carefully to examine each stone in <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>next</b> the fireplace at a distance about four feet above the ground.|$|E

By and by the tremulous tinkling of an aged piano reaches us from an adjoining chamber, and Aaron looks at me through his fingers, and I take a lightning glance at Mr. David, and he uncrosses his legs and rises, and sits down again. Aaron, in the most unconcerned way, proceeds to cut tobacco and rub it between his fingers, and I stretch out my legs and contemplate them with passionate approval. While we are thus occupied David has risen, and he is so thoroughly at his ease that he has begun to hum. He strolls round the kitchen, looking with sudden interest at the mantelpiece ornaments; he reads, for the hundredth time, the sampler on <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> <b>Next</b> the clock engages his attention; it is ticking, and that seems to impress him as novel and curious.

I found myself calling to mind the caution my husband had given me while we were at this part of the work, word for word as he had spoken it. 'Take care you don't find your hands in the next room.' That was what he had said down in the parlor. Up in his bedroom I kept on repeating it in my own mind--with my eyes all the while on the key, which he had moved to the inner side of the door to lock himself in--till the knowledge of what it meant burst on me like a flash of light. I looked at the wall, at the bedhead, at my own two hands--and I shivered as if it was winter time.|$|E
