40|$|This project {{follows the}} treaty-based legal efforts of sisters Mary and Carrie Dann in their fight to assert Western Shoshone land rights against the US government. Beginning with a 1952 claims {{case before the}} Indian Claims Commission, the US attempt to make restitutions for the {{wrongful}} taking of Western Shoshone lands itself threatened persistent Shoshone treaty rights. The Dann sisters, along with other, self-described Western Shoshone “traditionals”, undertook to reverse the federal liquidation of Shoshone treaty rights, engaging federal claims commissioners, attorneys, and courts along the way. Their legal activism relied heavily on the assertion of sovereign rights under the Western Shoshone’s 1863 treaty of peace and friendship with the United States. The Danns’ eventual representation before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights resulted in an important international censure against the United States’ indigenous policies. While the US government fervently prosecuted a claims award distribution that would liquidate Shoshone title to treaty lands, <b>the</b> <b>official</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> alternative vision of Shoshone-US relations and {{the significance of the}} Treaty of Ruby Valley which the Danns helped to inscribe {{is a testament to the}} power of treaty-based Native activism in challenging federal authority in Indian affairs...|$|E
40|$|The “paperless office” {{concept has}} been around for decades, and many have cited that the {{electronic}} office has instead increased the amount of paper produced. Case studies have shown that a successful “paperless” system requires motivation, ease of use, and cost savings [5]. Paper will co-exist with electronic records for the foreseeable future; however, what happens when <b>the</b> <b>official</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> institution becomes “paperless”? This short paper presents a case study describing the efforts in the University of Oregon Office of the President to move to a fully electronic records system, the trickle-down effect to campus units, and the work of the Libraries to preserve the institutional record. The Libraries created a model to solve the immediate needs of the Office of the President addressing issues of workflow and preservation before an ideal system and staffing could be realized. A hands-on approach was employed, focusing on day-to-day work and ease of use for office contacts, and standards and migration plans for archival files using PLATTER [1]. By doing this, a foundation was created for an electronic records system that can be adapted across campus for administrative offices, faculty scholarship, cultural museums, science labs, and student coursework...|$|E
