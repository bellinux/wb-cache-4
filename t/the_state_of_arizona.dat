5|$|Late in its duration, Hurricane Olivia brought {{increased}} moisture {{into the}} southwest United States. More than 2inches (50mm) of rainfall were reported across Arizona and New Mexico. Light precipitation was also reported in western Texas and southeastern California. The National Weather Service issued flash flood warnings throughout the region. Near Yuma, Arizona, thunderstorms caused three major power outages and produced flooding {{that resulted in}} the closure of a portion of U.S. Route 95. In Navajo and Pinal counties, the rainfall damaged roads, bridges, sewers, and homes, which amounted to about $250,000 in repair work for <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arizona.</b> The storm's moisture also produced locally heavy snowfall in higher elevations in the Rocky Mountains.|$|E

5|$|Three years later, the Bureau of Reclamation and <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arizona</b> {{agreed on}} an {{alternative}} to Orme. This was known as Plan 6, and it recommended four projects: a reconstruction of the Stewart Mountain Dam, a new or larger Roosevelt Dam, the Cliff Dam on the Verde River and finally, the New Waddell Dam on the Agua Fria River (a tributary of the Gila River). On November 6, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior James G. Watt recommended Plan 6. In April 1984, it was approved {{with the exception of}} the Cliff Dam, which needed further study and would eventually be removed from CAP.|$|E
5|$|To {{encourage}} tourism, the town's leaders sought National Historic Landmark {{status for}} Jerome; it was {{granted by the}} federal government in 1967.

By sponsoring music festivals, historic-homes tours, celebrations, and races, the community succeeded in attracting visitors and new businesses, which in the 21stcentury include art galleries, craft stores, wineries, coffee houses, and restaurants.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s the {{downtown}} area experienced a resurgence, {{with a level of}} construction activity not seen again until the urban real estate boom of the 2000s. By the end of the decade, Phoenix adopted the Phoenix Concept 2000 plan which split the city into urban villages, each with its own village core where greater height and density was permitted, further shaping the free-market development culture. Originally, there were nine villages, but this has been expanded to 15 over the years (see Cityscape below). This officially turned Phoenix into a city of many nodes, which would later be connected by freeways. The Phoenix Symphony Hall opened in 1972; other major structures which saw construction downtown during this decade were the First National Bank Plaza, the Valley Center (the tallest building in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arizona)</b> and the Arizona Bank building.|$|E

5|$|Most copper is mined or {{extracted}} as copper sulfides {{from large}} open pit mines in porphyry copper deposits that contain 0.4 to 1.0% copper. Sites include Chuquicamata in Chile, Bingham Canyon Mine in Utah, United States and El Chino Mine in New Mexico, United States. According to the British Geological Survey in 2005, Chile {{was the top}} producer of copper with at least one-third world share followed by the United States, Indonesia and Peru. Copper can also be recovered through the in-situ leach process. Several sites in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arizona</b> are considered prime candidates for this method. The amount of copper in use is increasing and the quantity available is barely sufficient to allow all countries to reach developed world levels of usage.|$|E
