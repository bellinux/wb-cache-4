500|$|On 22 July 2009, Kisnorbo {{signed for}} Leeds United on a two-year contract. He made his debut in a 2–1 win over Exeter City on 8 August. On his debut Kisnorbo {{suffered}} a head wound which required stitches, after receiving stitches to the wound off the pitch {{he came out}} wearing a head bandage. After playing for Australia on 12 August, Kisnorbo became Leeds's 100th full international player. Whilst at Leeds he {{established himself as a}} fans' favourite for his solid performances and his brave style of play. After suffering the head injury, which required 12 stitches, Kisnorbo wore a protective headband. He rejected plastic surgery to avoid losing his place in the team: [...] "I can't see myself going for [...] at the moment because I've got bigger <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> than getting this sorted." ...|$|E
500|$|Xhinovci {{has come}} to believe that he is Hitler reincarnated since he began {{dressing}} as the Nazi leader. He carries numerous pieces of Nazi paraphernalia around with him, including Nazi-era Reichsmarks, swastika-emblazoned buttons, scarves embroidered with swastikas and other Nazi imagery, as well as a copy of Mein Kampf. He has business cards featuring a swastika and the word [...] "Hitler" [...] printed in bold. Locals and peacekeepers alike do not seem to mind Xhinovci's Hitler impersonations, especially as many Kosovars are too preoccupied with the country's crippling poverty and rampant corruption to give his actions much thought. On the contrary, many passersby—including some NATO peacekeepers—stop and greet him with the Nazi salute. One local told Vice News: [...] "I have a lot of other <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> in my life. I might look at him if he walks by, but that's it." [...] Locals apparently believe that his way of earning a living [...] "shows great enterprise". [...] "People respect me," [...] Xhinovci explains. [...] "The young and old [...] men, women and children. Everyone greets me with [...] "Heil Hitler". Xhinovci's five daughters, referred to locally as [...] "Hitler's children", are not bothered by their father's Hitler impersonations. Xhinovci reportedly attends parent-teacher conferences dressed as Hitler and says that teachers and other parents do not mind his appearance. He says that every time he goes to pick his daughters up from school he is surrounded by children who want to talk with him and take pictures. [...] "Girls like to touch my face. They think it's a mask. They pull my hair and ask if they can kiss me on the face. When I'm out of the house with my family, people stop to talk to me. But my wife is not a jealous person—she doesn't mind." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kaine, a Roman Catholic, is {{personally}} against abortion, but is [...] "largely {{inclined to}} keep the law out of women's reproductive decisions." [...] Kaine has said: [...] "I'm {{a strong supporter of}} Roe v. Wade and women being able to make these decisions. In government, we have enough <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about.</b> We don't need to make people's reproductive decisions for them." [...] Kaine supports some legal restrictions on abortion, such as requiring parental consent for minors (with a judicial bypass procedure) and banning late-term abortions in cases where the woman's life is not at risk.|$|E

Peter {{thought so}} much of Mrs. Peter, he meant to be so {{thoughtful}} that she never would have a <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about.</b> But Peter was heedless. He always was heedless.

2500|$|A {{year after}} the election, there was still ongoing feuding between the McCain and Palin camps over {{the conduct of the}} campaign, {{culminating}} with the November 2009 publication of Palin's memoir [...] Palin criticized McCain campaign manager Steve Schmidt heavily, and contended that the McCain campaign had mismanaged her media appearances. Schmidt replied that Palin's telling was [...] "all fiction", and prior McCain strategist John Weaver denounced Palin for [...] "petty and pathetic" [...] attempts to get even. McCain himself simply said that he had read the book, was still very good friends with Palin, and stated: [...] "Look, I'm just moving on. I'm just moving on, and I've got too many other <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> except to say that I'm proud of my campaign." [...] McCain told his staff repeatedly, [...] "Don't look back in anger." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2008, Clarkson {{attracted}} {{over 500}} complaints to the BBC when he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes. The BBC stated the comment was a comic rebuttal {{of a common}} misconception about lorry drivers and was within the viewer's expectation of Clarkson's Top Gear persona. Chris Mole, the Member of Parliament for Ipswich, where five prostitutes were murdered in 2006, wrote a [...] "strongly worded" [...] letter to BBC Director-General Mark Thompson, demanding that Clarkson be sacked. Clarkson dismissed Mole's comments in his Sunday Times column the following weekend, writing, [...] "There are more important <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> than what some balding and irrelevant middle-aged man might have said on a crappy BBC2 motoring show." [...] Andrew Tinkler, {{chief executive of the}} Eddie Stobart Group, a major trucking company, stated that [...] "They were just having a laugh.

50|$|According {{to another}} legendary about Perumthachacn, his son Kannan was {{certainly}} a greater perfectionist in all craftsmanship and he outdid and outshined his own father. But, Perunthachan never envied him, he was only proud of his son. Nevertheless, the father had a different <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> {{and that was that}} Kannan was in deep love with a princess who was in fact Perumthachan’s own daughter born to a queen. His fatherhood was known to none other than himself and the queen. Though this {{was the subject of a}} secret gossip among just the close circle of Perumthachan’s assistants and the queen’s maids.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the time}} of the administration, the United States was short of nearly {{everything}} during their time of need. All citizens were asked to donate any weapons, horses, and ammunition they possessed to help supply the army, with a small hope of the items being returned. The rationing was done during this time of National need so that food for soldiers, and citizens, wouldn't be an issue. Concepts such as [...] "meatless Mondays" [...] and [...] "wheatless Wednesdays" [...] were also implemented to help ration food, so that the government had one less <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about,</b> essentially.|$|R

"Well, {{neither would}} anybody if they'd {{had all the}} worries I've had, sitting there {{worrying}} on a slow, hot train that stopped at every pig-pen--yes, and on a day-coach, too, by golly!

Oh, sure! But I {{made up my mind}}--I thought it all out for once, and I made up my mind <b>to</b> one <b>thing,</b> you can help me out by economizing, anyway." ...|$|R

60|$|If you and I {{had as many}} <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> as does Whitefoot the Wood Mouse, we {{probably}} never would be happy at all. But Whitefoot is happy whenever {{he has a chance}} to be, and in this he is wiser than most human beings. You see, there is not one of all the little people in the Green Forest who has so many enemies to watch out for as has Whitefoot. There are ever so many who would like nothing better than to dine on plump little Whitefoot. There are Buster Bear and Billy Mink and Shadow the Weasel and Unc' Billy Possum and Hooty the Owl and all the members of the Hawk family, not to mention Blacky the Crow in times when other food is scarce. Reddy and Granny Fox and Old Man Coyote are always looking for him.|$|E

50|$|Disaster {{has struck}} for the 12th Fleet - {{right at the}} worst time it could happen. Admiral Cole and the Independence are gone, but their closest friends {{have no time to}} grieve. Now that Siroc has someone who knows the {{location}} of the Dyson sphere, it looks like it's {{only a matter of time}} before everything is lost. But that's not the only <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about.</b> The Romulans and Klingons have become restless and are beginning to talk of withdrawing from the effort against Siroc ifStarfleet remains as leader of the campaign. With the walls closing in on all sides, Shelby must bear increasing pressure to win back the hearts and minds of Starfleet's allies and contend with her shrinking pool of friends and family.|$|R

50|$|Because Enefa's soul {{is within}} her body, {{she can hear}} the goddess' voice and see visions. Even though everyone, {{including}} Nahadoth, expects Enefa's soul to overtake her own, her soul defeats Enefa's and she replaces the goddess with Enefa's blessing. N.K. Jemisin's character study names her as impulsive and irrational (she obsesses over her mother's murder even when she has other <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about),</b> and not above hurting herself to get what she needs.|$|E
50|$|Arrest {{practices}} {{vary according}} to the counties that the crimes are committed in. For example, in a large city like Cleveland, Ohio, many minor crimes or infractions may go unreported just because the police have many more <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> besides small crimes, or may not even have the time to waste because of the heavy workload. But in a small city, more arrests may be made and reported because of the police not having too many things to do.|$|E
50|$|The song {{refers to}} a 95-page {{document}} written by Alexander Hamilton, former Secretary of the Treasury, to defend {{his name in the}} wake of a sex scandal. Hamilton does so to protect himself from a major political threat, as Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and Aaron Burr are made aware by Hamilton of his adulterous actions after they accused him of speculation and misappropriation of Treasury funds. He then publishes the document to the public, proving that he did not abuse his Cabinet position for financial gain, but had been instead victim of blackmail by James Reynolds for his one-year affair with Reynolds's wife Maria Reynolds. The document causes Angelica Schuyler to return from London to support her sister, Hamilton's wife Eliza. She then asks Hamilton angrily if he is satisfied, while Jefferson remarks on how he will never be President as his career has been sullied, which is a boon for the Democratic-Republican Party ("that's one less <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about).</b> The song concludes with all of the characters expressing sympathy for Hamilton's wife.|$|R
50|$|Gabrielle and Victor {{have a fight}} {{regarding}} his intention {{to run for governor}} of the state. She tells Victor that she was already married to a man who put his career first and she swore never to do it again, while he has vowed to never again let a “stupid woman” hold him back. He tries to apologize, saying he has been {{under a lot of pressure}} and she tells him he now has one less <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> since she’s intending to cancel the wedding. He says it’s too late to cancel but she responds that it’s “just in the nick of time”. The next morning Milton shows up early on her doorstep to apologize. She tells him it’s not his fault and he insists it is, since Victor has always been desperate for his father’s approval, especially since he’s never gotten it. She wonders why she should marry a man who values his father’s opinion more than hers. Milton tells her that after she left, Victor called him up and “tore him a new one” and blamed him for driving her away. Just then Victor arrives with roses and Milton sneaks out the back. He looks on approvingly as Victor and Gabrielle embrace.|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked by}} NME {{magazine}} {{about when the}} song was written, Ezra said: [...] "I actually wrote the song {{at the tail end}} of 2015. I tell crowds at gigs that I wrote this song when the biggest <b>thing</b> we had <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> was whether David Cameron had a sleepover with a pig. That gets a little chuckle. But it's true - those were the headlines. And in the last 18 months, the song has made more sense to me." ...|$|R

50|$|Hound {{made his}} first IDW Publishing {{appearance}} in the Spotlight issue on Galvatron, where {{it was revealed that}} he had been put in charge of guarding Thunderwing's inert corpse with Leadfoot, Skram, Road Rocket, Warpath and Sideswipe under his command. Clashing with Sideswipe over his desire to find his brother Sunstreaker, Hound soon had other <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> as a mysterious Transformer arrived and decimated his unit. While Hound survived, he had failed in his duty, as Thunderwing's body had disappeared. This version of Hound is more officious and serious than in other continuities.|$|E
5000|$|American code makers {{were often}} {{frustrated}} by the inability or refusal of combat units to use the codes—or worse, to use them properly. A soldier engaged in combat doesn't always {{feel the need to}} do things [...] "by the book" [...] even when there are very good reasons to do so, and generals on the front line felt that they had other <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about.</b> One codemaker suggested {{that the best way to}} address the problem was to publicly hang a few offenders, but he lacked the authority to do so.|$|E
60|$|It isn't {{a natural}} <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> keep on <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> the {{morality}} of one's material prosperity. These are proclivities superinduced by modern conditions of the conscience. There is a natural resistance in every healthy human being to such distressful heart-searchings. Strong instincts battled in Lady Harman against this intermittent sense of responsibility that was beginning <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> her. An immense lot of her was for simply running away from these troublesome considerations, for covering herself up from them, for distraction.|$|R
60|$|You see, Parsons' travels {{happened}} like this: When {{he first}} {{got to be}} postmaster and was green in the business, there come a letter for somebody he didn't know, and there wasn't any such person in the village. Well, he didn't know what to do, nor how to act, and there the letter stayed and stayed, week in and week out, till the bare sight of {{it gave him a}} conniption. The postage wasn't paid on it, and that was another <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about.</b> There wasn't any way to collect that ten cents, and he reckon'd the gov'ment would hold him responsible for it and maybe turn him out besides, when they found he hadn't collected it. Well, at last he couldn't stand it any longer. He couldn't sleep nights, he couldn't eat, he was thinned down to a shadder, yet he da'sn't ask anybody's advice, for the very person he asked for advice might go back on him and let the gov'ment know about the letter. He had the letter buried under the floor, but that did no good; if he happened to see a person standing over the place it'd give him the cold shivers, and loaded him up with suspicions, and he would sit up that night till the town was still and dark, and then he would sneak there and get it out and bury it in another place. Of course, people got to avoiding him and shaking their heads and whispering, because, the way he was looking and acting, they judged he had killed somebody or done something terrible, they didn't know what, and if he had been a stranger they would've lynched him.|$|R
2500|$|During an {{interview}} on February 7, 2010, Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace asked Palin if she supported repeal of [...] "don't ask, don't tell", the United States military policy which restricts efforts to discover or reveal closeted gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members or applicants, while barring those who are openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual from military service. Palin responded, [...] "I don't think so right now. I was surprised that the President spent time on that in his State of the Union speech when he only spent about 9 percent {{of his time in}} the State of the Union on national security issues. And I say that because there are other <b>things</b> <b>to</b> be <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> right now with the military. I think that kind of on the back burner is sufficient for now. To put so much time and effort and politics into it– unnecessary." ...|$|R

When she was an assistant, she prided herself on being a players coach, and thought she could always do that, but she has {{found that the}} relationship of a head coach to the players is different.

40|$|Short CourseThis {{course is}} aimed at {{engineers}} and technical professionals who need a broad-based introduction to basic pump selection, application, and operation. This course starts with the basics and builds to provide {{a full understanding of}} centrifugal, rotary, and reciprocating pumps. The course will include the following topics: centrifugal, rotary, and reciprocating pump similarities/differences; centrifugal rotary, and reciprocating pump configurations; nine fundamental principles for reliable pump operation; developing pump specifications; understanding pump curves; developing system curves; choosing a type of pump for a specific application. The course will answer the question, ?What are the <b>things</b> I need <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> when selecting, specifying, and operating pumps?? At the completion of the course, attendees will hold a strong understanding of basic concepts. This knowledge will act as a springboard to further growth of understanding of more complex pump concepts. An emphasis is placed on providing practical information with minimal theory; comprehension of the information presented requires little to no mathematical skills in hydraulic or mechanical design. This is NOT a pump design and/or maintenance class...|$|R
