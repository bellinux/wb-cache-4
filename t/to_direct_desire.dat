Pre-existing scenario planning methods call for collaboration between community members, but when cultural norms prevented men, women, and youth from coming together {{in the community of}} Ukupseni in Panama, the authors and community sought to devise an alternative method. The research objectives were twofold. First, to develop an alternative scenario planning method that would facilitate learning among decision makers about community needs and perspectives, and second, to explore ways <b>to</b> <b>direct</b> <b>desired</b> futures. Instead of forecasting through community-wide collaboration and backcasting with the creation of one vision through consensus, forecasting used individual interviews to create scenarios and backcasting was conducted separately with each of the six community groups (older women, young women with children, young women without children, young men, older men including fishermen and lobster-catchers, and individuals with formal education) resulting in several visions. To unify the results, we created an organizational matrix that allowed the visions of different community groups to be compared. The organizational matrix allowed decision makers to observe that women and youth, the most marginalized members of the community, had convergent visions that were very different from men whose perspectives and knowledge are more often included in decision making...|$|R

Implantable biomaterials that interact with their host via an interfacial layer of active biomolecules <b>to</b> <b>direct</b> a <b>desired</b> cellular response to the implant would represent a major and much sought after improvement. Another, perhaps equally revolutionary, development that is on the biomedical horizon is the introduction of cost-effective microarrays for fast, highly multiplexed screening for biomarkers on cell membranes and in a variety of analyte solutions. Both of these advances will rely on effective methods of functionalizing surfaces with bioactive molecules. After a brief introduction to other methods currently available, this review will describe recently developed approaches that use energetic ions extracted from plasma to facilitate simple, one-step covalent surface immobilization of bioactive molecules. A kinetic theory model of the immobilization process by reactions with long-lived, mobile, surface-embedded radicals will be presented.

Introduction: The nasoalveolar molding appliance is used pre-surgically in cleft lip and palate patients as a method of bringing together the lip and alveolus by applying force <b>to</b> <b>direct</b> <b>desired</b> growth. 1 It is used in the infant to reduce the pre-surgical severity of the initial cleft and to improve alignment of the base of the nose and lip segments. 1 The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the long-term effect of nasoalveolar molding on facial growth and nasolabial esthetics in complete unilateral cleft lip and palate patients. Methods: Sixteen (N= 16) post-surgical cleft lip and palate patients who had undergone nasoalveolar molding as infants and twelve (N= 12) control patients, treated surgically without nasoalveolar molding, were recalled for a clinical examination including impressions, photographs, and a lateral cephalogram. Dental models were analyzed using the Goslon Yardstick, developed by Mars et al. in 1987. 2 ¬ Photographs were analyzed using the Asher-McDade method for rating the nasolabial appearance in patients with cleft lip and palate. 3 Finally, lateral cephalograms were digitized and analyzed using Dolphin Imaging software. Results: Separate ordinal logistic regression models indicated no significant difference between the molding and non-molding groups in Goslon score, nasal form, nose symmetry, vermilion border or nasolabial profile assessments. Generalized linear models revealed one cephalometric variable to be statistically significant between the two groups. The ANB angle was decreased by 2. 34 degrees on average in the group who underwent nasoalveolar molding prior to cheiloplasty. Intra-rater and inter-rater weighted kappa statistics were calculated for each variable. Conclusion: Short-term benefits of nasoalveolar molding have been documented in the literature. However, more long-term studies are needed in order to demonstrate the longitudinal effects of the appliance on esthetics and midfacial growth. Due to the limitations of cleft lip and palate studies, it is often difficult to accurately assess treatment effects. Through inter-center studies such as the Eurocleft and Americleft projects, some limitations and biases can be overcome in order to compare various protocols and outcomes. 4 In the future, it is the desire of the investigators to include the current sample of nasoalveolar molding patients in the future efforts and expansion of the Americleft study...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MArt et Scien (Urban and Regional Planning)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. “Without water, {{there is}} no life on the earth; {{it is the most}} {{important}} of all elements. It must be managed in the best possible way” (Cunningham, 2009). Balanced and self-renewing ecosystems are not new phenomena, developed by earlier civilisations, and still part of our modern cities and societies today. However, the increasing urbanisation, densifications and related urban challenges of the modern urban environment is also increasing the pressure on sustainable resources world-wide. Countries responded to the concept of Integrated Urban Water Management (IUWM) in many deferent ways; the USA formulated the concept of Low-Impact Development (LID), the UK‟s approach was Sustainable Urban Drainage System (SUDS), and New Zealand formulated their approach as Low Impact Urban Design and Development (LIUDD). Aiming to integrate all of the above mentioned approaches Australia developed the concept of Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD). WSUD refers to the interdisciplinary cooperation of water management, urban design and landscape planning which considers all parts of the urban water cycle, combines water management functions and urban design approaches and facilitates synergies between ecological, economic, social and cultural sustainability (Wagner, 2010). In the local South African context it is now time for a fundamental paradigm shift to identify and protect sustainable resources, specifically stormwater, not only as a challenge, but a valuable resource playing a critical role in the urban planning and design process and overall sustainability of South Africa’s water resources. This approach includes the rethinking of the role of layout-planning <b>to</b> <b>direct</b> the <b>desired</b> future of our cities. Water Sensitive Planning (WSP) is introduced by this research, as an initiative to guide current planning and urban design approaches in South African environments, based on the concept of Integrated Urban Water Management (IUWM), with the objective to manage the urban water cycle as a whole, and not as separate entities (Barton, 2009). It bridges gaps between various sectors and provides a platform for trans-disciplinary planning, which is a challenge for sustainable water resources management in South African cities. In order to determine whether South Africa has identified stormwater as a valuable resource, integrated in the urban planning process, the research focused on Potchefstroom’s Local Municipalities approach towards Water Management and Urban Planning. Local policy frameworks such as the Spatial Development Framework (SDF), Integrated Development Plan (IDP) and the Water Service Development Plan (WSDP) were evaluated in an attempt to determine the priority and approach towards integrated water management and spatial planning. Planning recommendations referred to international best practices and case studies from Australia, to guide local South African urban planning and urban design approaches to protect the valuable natural resources in the urban environment, by redefining the current role of layout-planning in a local context, and <b>to</b> <b>direct</b> the <b>desired</b> future and sustainable development in South Africa.

Efficient redistribution of empty vehicles is critical in larger PRT networks where running times are longer than acceptable waiting-times. We have previously developed methods for allocating destinations to empty PRT vehicles sequentially as they become available. In this paper the allocation of empty vehicles is refined into three stages. The first stage is essentially the previous sequential allocation. In {{the second and third}} stage empty vehicles en route are reallocated by switching destinations between each other. In the second stage waiting passengers are allocated the nearest vehicle in order of longest wait. In the third stage remaining empty vehicles en route are reallocated based on minimum running distance. The optimization problem in the third stage corresponds to the transportation problem and it is solved approximately by a heuristic method suggested by Russel. Applied to a network with 25 stations, 16 kilometers of guide-way and 200 vehicles the combined reallocation methods reduced average waiting and the longest wait to about half compared with sequential decisions alone.

40|$|A {{great deal}} depends on {{preparing}} high quality teachers, and reformers of teacher preparation have recently drawn {{attention to the}} need for clearer delineations of effective practice, {{what it takes to be}} a teacher, and standards of preparation. Taken together, these reform proposals arguably frame a professional ideal for teaching. How this ideal and other ideals are established as desirable for beginning teachers during preparation remains relatively unexplored. In this study I thus tease out the desired ideals of teaching in two alternative residency-based teacher preparation programs, City Teacher Prep (CTP) and a Montessori teacher training program (MONT). Drawing from literature in the humanities and the learning sciences, I develop a conceptual framework of desire as socially constructed and conveyed to beginning teachers through orienting narratives that serve <b>to</b> <b>direct</b> them toward <b>desired</b> objects of teaching. I also postulate that beginners develop desires by making heartfelt investments in those objects. I use a constructivist grounded theory approach to collect and analyze observation and interview data. My findings reveal differences in the desired objects at each program suggestive of a tension between a professional ideal and vocational ideal of teaching. I also find evidence of standing desires for leadership among beginners at both programs that could result in their eventually leaving teaching. Through this investigation, I illuminate the conceptual features of desire and show how it can inform our understanding of teacher preparation...|$|R

In this article, we present a novel tool, called CRISPRpred, for efficient in silico prediction of sgRNAs on-target activity which is based on the applications of Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. To conduct experiments, we have used a benchmark dataset of 17 genes and 5310 guide sequences where there are only 20 % true values.

40|$|The {{cultural}} lifestyle {{sport of}} parkour maintains an ambiguous {{position at the}} nexus between deviance and leisure. It conforms to consumer capitalism’s commodified norms of ‘cool individualism’, risk-taking, {{and the creation of}} ‘deviant’ identities, whilst remaining a spatially transgressive practice that is continuously excluded by the spatial guardians of the hyper-regulated city. Drawing upon ultra-realist criminological theory and a critical rethinking of leisure, consumerism and urban space, this thesis explains parkour’s ambiguous position by suggesting that there is a fundamental paradox at the heart of parkour’s spatial practice that is a product of late-capitalism’s own making. As Post-Fordist Western societies shifted toward a consumer-oriented economy, consumer capitalism had to stoke the desire for cool and alternative identities such as parkour that tapped into subjectivities increasingly oriented to socio-symbolic competition and individualistic distinction. Simultaneously, deindustrialised cities were regenerated through the commodified urban leisure economy, prompting a renewed reliance upon hyper-regulated urban spaces <b>to</b> harness and <b>direct</b> <b>desire</b> and identities and consumption into these commodified spatial contexts. Consequently, this thesis argues that the paradox of parkour is a dual-product of late-capitalism’s cultivation of subjectivities geared to the pursuit of unique and culturally relevant identities, and a consumer economy that is reliant upon the hyper-regulated specificity of central consumer spaces. Consequently, consumer capitalism is caught in the double-bind of simultaneously promoting parkour whilst attempting <b>to</b> prohibitively <b>direct</b> it into approved and commodified spatial contexts. This is a paradox that has been entirely neglected in the academic literature on parkour, {{due in large part to}} the fetishisation of parkour as a form of ‘resistance’. This thesis challenges this fundamental assumption, drawing upon 28 -months of in-depth ethnography among a parkour community in the North East of England. It accesses the wider life-worlds of traceurs, following them not only through their illicit practice of parkour in the city, but through their attempts to ‘make it’ in the commodified and professional world of parkour, cultural lifestyle sports, and social media fame. It explores the desires and motivations at the heart of the traceurs’ practice and their attempts to preserve a sense of culturally-relevant identity while navigating the precarious waters of early adulthood in late-capitalism. Additionally, the thesis utilises walking interviews with security guards to supplement ethnographic observations around spatial governance, systemic spatial violence and the amoral economy of late-capitalist cities. As such, the thesis provides a critical rebuke to the romanticisation of parkour as a mode of proto-political resistance, and instead attempts to explain its ambiguous position in the deviant-leisure nexus through an in-depth analysis of urban change, consumer culture, and identity in late-capitalism. ...|$|R
