5|$|As per Tulsidas, Rama is the {{efficient}} and material cause (Nimitta and Upadana) of the world, which is real since Rama is real. In several verses of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas {{says that the}} animate and inanimate world is a manifestation of Rama, and the universe is the cosmic form of Rama. Authors interpret these verses <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> {{that the world is}} real according to Tulsidas, in keeping with the Vishishtadvaita philosophy of Ramanuja. However, at some places in the Ramcharitmanas and Kavitavali, Tulsidas compares the world to a night or a dream and says it is Mithya (false or unreal). Some commentators interpret these verses <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> that in Tulsidas' opinion the world is unreal as per the Vivartavada doctrine of Adi Shankara, while some others interpret them <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> that the world is transient yet real as per the Satkhyativada doctrine of Ramananda. Uday Bhanu Singh concludes that in Tulsidas' view, the world is essentially the form of Rama and appears to be different from Rama due to Maya. Its visible form is transient, which is what Tulsidas means by Mithya.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Availability of lethal {{means is}} a {{significant}} risk factor for suicide. This study investigated whether occupations with greater access <b>to</b> lethal <b>means</b> had higher suicide rates than those without access, and further, whether this relationship differed for females versus males. METHODS: A retrospective mortality study was conducted across the Australian population over the period 2001 to 2012. Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which collects Census information on occupation for the Australian population, and the National Coroners Information System, which records information on suicide deaths, were combined. Employed suicide records were coded by occupation and work-related access <b>to</b> lethal <b>means.</b> Descriptive analysis and negative binomial regression {{were used to assess}} the relationship between access <b>to</b> <b>means</b> and suicide. RESULTS: Persons in occupations with access to firearms, medicines or drugs, and carbon monoxide more frequently used these methods to end their lives than those without access <b>to</b> <b>means.</b> Females employed in occupations with access <b>to</b> <b>means</b> had suicide rates that were 3. 02 times greater (95 % CI 2. 60 to 3. 50, p <  0. 001) than those employed in occupations without access. Males in occupations with access had suicide rates that were 1. 24 times greater than those without access (95 % CI 1. 16 to 1. 33, p <  0. 001). CONCLUSION: Work-related access <b>to</b> <b>means</b> is a risk factor for suicide in the employed population, but is associated with a greater risk for females than males. The findings of this study suggest the importance of controlling access to lethal methods in occupations where these are readily available. Open Acces...|$|R
