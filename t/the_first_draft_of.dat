5|$|In January 1964 Fleming went to Goldeneye {{for what}} {{proved to be}} his last holiday and wrote <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>draft</b> <b>of</b> The Man with the Golden Gun.

5|$|The {{final report}} of the committee, which became <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>draft</b> <b>of</b> the Constitution, was the first {{workable}} constitutional plan, as Madison's Virginia Plan had simply been an outline of goals and a broad structure.

It is also unclear {{whether or not a}} French edition of Part I was published in 1793. François Lanthenas, who translated The Age of Reason into French in 1794, wrote that it was first published in France in 1793, but no book fitting his description has been positively identified. Barlow published the first English edition of The Age of Reason, Part I in 1794 in London, selling it for a mere three pence.|$|E
5|$|After {{initializing}} {{the concept}} in January 2013, the two discussed {{the project for}} three or four months before creating an outline for the whole story.

They looked at past and present social movements for civil rights for inspiration for how one would progress and how people might respond to a movement for android rights. Luna wrote <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>draft</b> <b>of</b> issue one, then the two worked together to rewrite it.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in October 2004, the Writers Guild of America, west {{conducted}} arbitration {{through the}} scripts {{that had been}} written since Barry Levinson developed the film at Warner Bros. in 1987. Lewis Colick, James Toback and Tom Epperson disassociated themselves for credit by the WGA. The Guild justified credit to Lewis Colick, who wrote <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>draft</b> <b>of</b> The Bobby Darin Story in 1987, and Kevin Spacey. Actor-writer Jeffrey Meek believed he should have deserved credit; he was paid $85,000 of a promised $125,000 to settle his claim to have performed writing services.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1841, Meyerbeer had {{completed}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>draft</b> <b>of</b> Le prophète, but refused to stage it because the then director of the opera, Leon Pillet, wished to cast his mistress, Rosine Stoltz, {{in the part of}} Fidès, the hero's mother. (Berlioz characterised Stoltz as 'la Directrice du Directeur'). Meyerbeer insisted on Pauline Viardot for the role. Meyerbeer lodged the score with a Parisian lawyer, and refused to countenance any production until his wishes were met. It was not until 1849 when the Opéra was willing to agree his conditions. Meyerbeer was unique in his time in having the wealth and influence to impose his will as a composer in this way.|$|E

Number 9 Films came on board as a producer in 2011, when co-founder Elizabeth Karlsen secured {{the rights to the}} novel. The film is co-produced by New York-based Killer Films, which joined the project when co-founder and Haynes's collaborator Christine Vachon approached Haynes to direct in 2013. Principal photography began in March 2014, in Cincinnati, Ohio, and lasted 34 days. Cinematographer Edward Lachman shot Carol on Super 16 mm film.|$|E
