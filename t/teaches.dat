40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} we {{examined}} how the variables: <b>teaching</b> autonomy, <b>teaching</b> goals <b>teaching</b> style and teachers' perceptions of transactional distance (TTD) work together within the pedagogical decision-making process in different <b>teaching</b> environments. The independent variable was the <b>teaching</b> environment, which was divided into three: entirely distance environment (Distance-E); blended distance environment (Distance-B); and the traditional environment (Traditional). The dependent variables were <b>teaching</b> autonomy, <b>teaching</b> goals, <b>teaching</b> style and TTD, i. e. teachers' evaluation {{of their ability to}} communicate with the students, explain the content and their satisfaction from the <b>teaching</b> environment. One hundred and sixty faculty members who <b>teach</b> in distance environments and one hundred and sixty faculty members who <b>teach</b> in a traditional environment answered a five-part study questionnaire. The finding indicated that <b>teaching</b> autonomy, <b>teaching</b> goal and <b>teaching</b> style are significant predictors of TTD. Furthermore, <b>teaching</b> style serves as a mediator variable connecting <b>teaching</b> autonomy and the <b>teaching</b> goal to the TTD. This pattern was repeated in both structural and measurement models in all three <b>teaching</b> environments, indicating the centrality of the <b>teaching</b> style as well as <b>teaching</b> goal and <b>teaching</b> autonomy in the teachers' pedagogical decision-making process and <b>teaching</b> outputs. We concluded that affecting the teachers' pedagogical characteristics, which serve as mechanisms that influence the results of <b>teaching,</b> is an important component in the process of the technological change in 21 st century education...|$|R
