5|$|Included {{were nine}} Australians—three {{officers}} and six sergeants—who {{had been selected}} by AIF Headquarters in April 1918. All were experienced soldiers, with three having served at Gallipoli {{as well as in}} France. Sailing on the SS City of Marseilles on 17 June 1918 the Australians arrived in Murmansk and most were immediately sent out on patrol. Later they were switched to the Archangel section. The men were then broken into small advisory groups and attached to White Russian and White Finnish units, being engaged in a range of administrative, instructional and advisory tasks. Due to their isolation, it is difficult to make generalisations about the nature of service experienced by the Australians at this time. Captain P.F. Lohan served in a variety of administrative positions both in Murmansk and Archangel, whilst Sergeant R.L. Graham was commissioned in the field and became railway <b>transport</b> <b>officer</b> on the Archangel-Vologda railway. Several other sergeants were involved in the various training roles, while Captain Allan Brown was attached to the North Russian Rifles based at Onega—a White Russian battalion.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – In Dutch detainee care {{custodial}} <b>transport</b> police <b>officers</b> experience {{high levels}} of aggression and violence from detainees. Being a {{first of its kind}} in the Netherlands, the purpose of this paper is to unravel the true nature and origins of such workplace aggression against <b>transport</b> <b>officers</b> and focuses on the role of street-level leadership and leadership by management for its mitigation and prevention. Design/methodology/approach – Unique in such closed institutions as the prison system, the study employs an extensive mixed methods approach, combining observations, interviews and survey data collected among <b>transport</b> <b>officers</b> and detainees in 2012 - 2013. Findings – The research shows that within the exercised street-level leadership of <b>transport</b> <b>officers</b> especially staff orientation towards detainees has great impact. Perceived inappropriate treatment is likely to increase detainees’ aggressive behaviours, with potentially detrimental effects such as heightened levels of officers’ job stress, decreased safety and decreased quality of detainee transport. The solutions offered indicate that while <b>transport</b> <b>officers</b> could benefit from a supportive staff orientation, transport police management might need to pay more attention to rule enforcement leadership within their efforts to optimize working conditions. Originality/value – The major practical implication of this research is the potential impact of training in affecting the decisions of frontline public employees in a way that their street-level leadership practices manifest the organizational values and alignment with societal values to ensure an adequate public sector service delivery...|$|R

Turner was a proficient sketcher and reporter, as reported by his commanding officer on 29 November 1882. The same year {{he served in the}} Egyptian campaign. The following year he undertook training at the School of Musketry in Hythe, Kent, where he became qualified to instruct the theory and practice of Musketry. He was promoted Major in 1901 and retired from the army in 1902. It was in the latter year that he purchased Thatcham House which was to be his home for the remainder of his life.

25|$|Smith-Dorrien {{was present}} at the Battle of Isandlwana during the Zulu Wars on 22 January 1879, serving with the British {{invasion}} force as a <b>transport</b> <b>officer</b> for the army's Royal Artillery detachment. As Zulu forces overran the British forces, Smith-Dorrien narrowly escaped on his transport pony over 20 miles of rough terrain with twenty Zulu warriors in hot pursuit, crossing the Buffalo River, 80 yards wide and with a strong current, by holding the tail of a loose horse. Smith-Dorrien was one of fewer than fifty British survivors of the battle (many more native African troops on the British side also survived), and one of only five Imperial officers to escape the Zulu bloodbath. Because of his conduct in trying to help other soldiers escape from the battlefield, including a colonial commisariat officer named Hamer whose life he saved, he was recommended for a Victoria Cross, but, as the recommendation did not go through the proper channels, he never received it. He took part in the rest of that war.|$|E

He entered the navy and {{took part in the}} Gambia Campaign in 1894. For his {{services}} in this conflict he was mentioned in despatches. He then went on to see action in the East African Campaign in 1898, during which he was wounded, and again was mentioned in despatches. Fitzmaurice was active in the Second Boer War between 1899 and 1901, and in the First World War, having become a captain on 30 June 1910. During the latter conflict he captained the battleship , from 5 August 1914 until her loss during the Dardanelles Campaign in 1915. Triumph was torpedoed by the German submarine SM U-21 on 25 May. As she capsized Fitzmaurice was thrown into the water 'as though he had been shot from a gun'. He was picked up by a destroyer after several minutes in the water, apparently with his monocle still firmly in place. He then served as Principal Naval <b>Transport</b> <b>Officer,</b> Dardanelles and Salonika from 1915 until 1916, and then Chief of Staff, Eastern Mediterranean until 1917.|$|E

500|$|An {{early and}} very {{influential}} modern historian, George Grote, {{set the tone}} by expressing incredulity at the numbers given by Herodotus: [...] "To admit this overwhelming total, or anything near to it, is obviously impossible." [...] Grote's main objection is the supply problem, though he does not analyse the problem in detail. He did not reject Herodotus's account altogether, citing the latter's reporting of the Persians' careful methods of accounting and their stockpiling of supply caches for three years, but {{drew attention to the}} contradictions in the ancient sources. A later influential historian, J. B. Bury, calls Herodotus's numbers [...] "wholly fabulous" [...] and judges that the Persian land forces may have been 180,000. [...] A major limiting factor for the size of the Persian army, first suggested by Sir Frederick Maurice (a British <b>transport</b> <b>officer)</b> is the supply of water. Maurice suggested in the region of 200,000 men and 70,000 animals could have been supported by the rivers in that region of Greece. He further suggested that Herodotus may have confused the Persian terms for chiliarchy (1,000) and myriarchy (10,000), leading to an exaggeration by a factor of ten. Other early modern scholars estimated that the land forces participating in the invasion at 100,000 soldiers or less, based on the logistical systems available to the Ancients.|$|E

2500|$|Houston and Bates {{considered}} many climbers, {{and selected}} {{them for their}} compatibility as a team and all-round experience rather than individual brilliance. Houston was aware that personality clashes between team members had been detrimental to other Karakoram expeditions, most notable Wiessner's, and was keen to avoid them. The six climbers selected were Robert Craig, a ski instructor from Seattle, Art Gilkey, a geologist from Iowa, Dee Molenaar, a geologist and artist from Seattle, Pete Schoening, also from Seattle and at 25 {{the youngest of the}} party, and George Bell, a nuclear scientist from Los Alamos. The eighth member of the team was Tony Streather, an English army officer who was initially appointed <b>Transport</b> <b>Officer,</b> but showed sufficient prowess to become a full member of the climbing team. The biggest disappointment was that William House, who had {{played a major role in}} the 1938 expedition, was unable to return for business reasons.

Tryon was attached to Octavia, but his duties were to act as <b>transport</b> <b>officer</b> at Annesley Bay, {{which was to be}} used as a staging post for troops and supplies for Sir Robert Napier's expedition to Magdala in Abyssinia. Tryon arrived in Bombay on 10 October 1867 where preparations were already underway. 291 transport ships were chartered, mainly from Bombay but some coming from England via the Cape of Good Hope. The advance party went to Zoulla in Annesley Bay in November, described as one of the hottest places on earth. The expedition delivered a fighting force of 4,000 men to Magdala out of total 13,000 soldiers and 60,000 people involved all together. 36,000 animals, mainly for transport, had to be taken to Zoulla. There was no drinking water, so 30,000 tons had to be distilled by the ships' steam engines using 8,000 tons of coal in the process, with ships held at anchor with their engines running. Tryon's duties involved early morning meetings ashore with military authorities, days spent unloading and organising ships, and evenings spent in preparation for the next. Tryon was commended for his organisational skills and tact in dealing with all the disparate parties and complaining ships' captains. Approximately half his staff was invalided out because of the heat during the six months' stay, with the rest all suffering. When he left he was presented with a scroll recording the appreciation of his efforts by the captains of the transport fleet, and later in England was presented with a specially commissioned dinner service decorated with scenes commemorating the campaign. He was awarded the CB for his services in Abyssinia.|$|E

60|$|Meanwhile, {{in spite}} of the {{vigorous}} attack that was being made on the Malakand, it had been decided to send some assistance to the little band at Chakdara. Captain Wright and forty sowars of the 11th Bengal Lancers with Captain Baker of the 2nd Bombay Grenadiers and <b>transport</b> <b>officer</b> at the Malakand, started at dawn on the 27th, by the road from the north camp. Before they had gone very far they came under the fire of the enemy on the hills. These did not dare to venture into the plain, but availed themselves of the broken nature of the country. As the squadron reached the road leading to the polo ground, Captain Wright received information that the enemy were collected on the plain and immediately the pace was quickened in the hopes of a charge being possible. But the tribesmen ran to the hills {{at the sight of the}} Lancers, and maintained a constant, though luckily, an ill-aimed fire. At length the village of Batkhela was reached, and beyond it the Amandara Pass came in sight. This is a gap in a long spur, which runs from the southern side of the valley to the rapid river in the middle. As the river was then in full flood and unfordable, the only road to Chakdara lay over or through the spur. But the pass was held by the enemy.|$|E
6000|$|It is a moot question, {{whether it}} would not have been far better to have done here as in India—namely, to put the {{transport}} train under the commissariat; and the overwhelming majority of opinion is, that this would have been a very preferable course. In the first place, the commissariat have no responsibility whatever. They have simply to hand over at Zulla so many thousand bags of rice, sugar, biscuit, &c., and to say to them, “Deliver them in certain proportions at such and such stations along the road.” This done, their responsibility ceases. If there is a deficiency anywhere, they have only to say, “We handed over the stores at Zulla in ample time, and if they have not arrived it is no fault of ours.” I cannot but think that it would be far better for the commissariat to have a transport train of their own. In India they have proved over and over again that they are capable of carrying out their transport arrangements admirably. During the mutiny there was hardly a case occurred where the commissariat did not manage to have the food up ready for the men at the end of the day’s march. For the conveyance of military stores and baggage, the transport train should be perfectly distinct from that of the commissariat. So many mules and drivers should be told off to each regiment, and that regiment should be responsible for them. One of the officers and a sergeant or two would be told off to look after them, and see that they were properly fed, watered, and looked after. The transport-train officer with the division would be in charge of spare mules, and exchange them when required for regimental mules which might have fallen sick by the way; in addition to which, a certain proportion of spare mules for casualties might be handed to each regiment. In case of a halt of a few days only, the mules would remain in charge of the troops; but if the halt were likely to be prolonged, the mules would be handed over to the <b>transport</b> <b>officer,</b> and by him used to assist the commissariat, or upon any duty for which they might be required.(2) ...|$|E
