40|$|Aluminium (Al) uptake and {{transport}} in the root tip of buckwheat {{is not yet}} completely understood. For localization of Al in root <b>tips,</b> fluorescent <b>dyes</b> and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) were compared. The staining of Al with morin is an appropriate means to study qualitatively the radial distribution along the root tip axis of Al which is complexed by oxalate and citrate in buckwheat roots. The results compare well with the distribution of total Al determined by LA-ICP-MS which could be reliably calibrated to compare with Al contents by conventional total Al determination using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. The Al localization in root cross-sections along the root tip showed that in buckwheat Al is highly mobile in the radial direction. The root apex predominantly accumulated Al in the cortex. The subapical root section showed a homogenous Al distribution across the whole section. In the following root section Al was located particularly in the pericycle and the xylem parenchyma cells. With further increasing distance from the root apex Al could be detected only in individual xylem vessels. The results {{support the view that}} the 10 [*]mm apical root tip is the main site of Al uptake into the symplast of the cortex, while the subapical 10 – 20 [*]mm zone is the main site of xylem loading through the pericycle and xylem parenchyma cells. Progress in the better molecular understanding of Al transport in buckwheat will depend on the consideration of the tissue specificity of Al transport and complexation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{fractional}} volume {{occupied by}} extracellular space in tissues, termed α, {{is an important}} parameter of tissue architecture that affects cellular functions and drug delivery. We report a technically simple fluorescent dye partitioning method to measure α in tissue slices based on microfiberoptic detection of dye fluorescence in tissue versus overlying solution. Microfiberoptic <b>tip</b> geometry and <b>dyes</b> were selected for α determination from fluorescence intensity ratios, without the need to correct for illumination profile, light scattering/absorption, or dye binding. The method was validated experimentally using cell-embedded gels of specified α-values and optical properties. In mouse brain slices, α was strongly location-dependent, ranging from 0. 16 in thalamus to 0. 22 in brainstem, and was sensitive to cell volume changes. Aquaporin- 4 water channel gene deletion caused significant extracellular space expansion, with α = 0. 181 ± 0. 002 in cortex in wild-type mice and 0. 211 ± 0. 003 in Aquaporin- 4 knockout mice. In slices of LLC 1 cell tumors grown in mice to ∼ 5 mm diameter, α decreased remarkably from ∼ 0. 45 in superficial tumor to 100 μm) tumor. Fluorescent dye partitioning with microfiberoptic detection permits rapid, accurate, and anisotropy-insensitive determination of α-values in tissue slices...|$|R
40|$|To determine, in three-dimensions, the {{difference}} between prostate delineation in magnetic resonance (MR) and computer tomography (CT) images for radiotherapy treatment planning. Three radiation oncologists, considered experts in the field, outlined the prostate without seminal vesicles both on CT, and axial, coronal, and sagittal MR images for 18 patients. To compare the resulting delineated prostates, the CT and MR scans were matched in three-dimensions using chamfer matching on bony structures. The volumes were measured and the interscan and interobserver variation was determined. The spatial difference between delineation in CT and MR (interscan variation) {{as well as the}} interobserver variation were quantified and mapped three-dimensionally (3 D) using polar coordinates. A urethrogram was performed and the location of the <b>tip</b> of the <b>dye</b> column was compared with the apex delineated in CT and MR images. Interscan variation: CT volumes were larger than the axial MR volumes in 52 of 54 delineations. The average ratio between the CT and MR volumes was 1. 4 (standard error of mean, SE: 0. 04) which was significantly different from 1 (p < 0. 005). Only small differences were observed between the volumes outlined in the various MR scans, although the coronal MR volumes were smallest. The CT derived prostate was 8 mm (standard deviation, SD: 6 mm) larger {{at the base of the}} seminal vesicles and 6 mm (SD 4 mm) larger at the apex of the prostate than the axial MRI. Similar figures were obtained for the CT and the other MRI scans. Interobserver variation: The average ratio between the volume derived by one observer for a particular scan and patient and the average volume was 0. 95, 0. 97, and 1. 08 (SE 0. 01) for the three observers, respectively. The 3 D pattern of the overall observer variation (1 SD) for CT and axial MRI was similar and equal to 3. 5 to 2. 8 mm at the base of the seminal vesicles and 3 mm at the apex. CT-derived prostate volumes are larger than MR derived volumes, especially toward the seminal vesicles and the apex of the prostate. This interscan variation was found to be larger than the interobserver variation. Using MRI for delineation of the prostate reduces the amount of irradiated rectal wall, and could reduce rectal and urological complication...|$|R
40|$|In nature, many {{swimming}} and flying creatures use {{the principle of}} oscillatory lift-based propulsion. Often the flapping element is flexible, totally or partially. The flow dynamics because of a flexible flap is thus of considerable interest. We are interested especially in lunate fish propulsion. The present work investigates the effect of trailing edge flexibility on the flow field created by an oscillating airfoil {{in an attempt to}} mimic the flow around the flexible tails often found in fish. A flexible flap with negligible mass and stiffness is attached at the trailing edge of NACA 0015 airfoil. The flap length is 75 % of the rigid chord length. The airfoil oscillates about a hinge point at 30 % chord from the leading edge {{and at the same time}} it moves in a circular path in stationary water. The parameters varied are frequency, amplitude of oscillation and forward speed. For a given combination of amplitude and frequency of oscillation, the forward speed is chosen such that the Strouhal number comes around 0. 3, which falls in the gamut of Strouhal numbers for maximum propulsive efficiency. We visualize the flow with dye and particles and measure velocities using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). We use shadow technique and image processing to study the flap dynamics. We do a qualitative and quantitative comparison of the wake flow generated by two airfoil models, one with rigid trailing edge (model -B) and the other with flexible trailing edge (model -A) i. e. with a flexible flap fixed to the trailing edge. We study the flap dynamics, the flow around the flap, evolution of vortices, wake width, circulations around airfoil and vortices, momentum and energy in the wake (which is measure of propulsion efficiency), vortex geometry in the wake in terms of vortex spacing, etc. We also conduct a parametric study for both the models. Flap dynamics plays a prominent role in defining the signature of the wake. The observed flap deflections are quite large and the flap exhibits more than one mode of deflection; this affects the vortex-shedding pattern. The flap tip also executes a near sinusoidal motion with a phase difference between the trailing edge and the flap <b>tip.</b> The <b>dye</b> visualization studies show that a flexible trailing edge induces multiple vortices while in case of a rigid trailing edge, large vortical structures are shed. In case of flexible trailing edge (model -A), the vortices are shed away from the mean path of motion and are arranged in a ‘reverse Karman vortex street’ pattern producing an undulating jet representing a thrust on the airfoil. For the same Strouhal number, in case of rigid trailing edge (model -B), the vortices are shed nearly along the mean path of motion indicating a momentumless wake. The wake structures, particularly in case of model -A, are nearly insensitive to variations in amplitude and frequency. The wake of model -B shows some variable flow patterns for different amplitudes of oscillation. Although the total chord of model -A is 1. 75 times more than the chord of model -B, the wake width is nearly the same for the two models when the amplitude of oscillation is same. The addition of the flap to the airfoil keeps the wake flow two-dimensional or symmetric about the center plane for longer times and longer downstream distances in comparison with the wake flow generated by rigid trailing edge. For 15 o and 20 o amplitudes of oscillations, the flow separates over the airfoil itself; the interaction of the separated flow with the flexible flap is quite interesting, which needs further investigations. The wake generated by the airfoil with flexible flap at the trailing edge has some common features with the wakes generated by the flow over a flapping filament (which is the one-dimensional representation of a fluttering flag), an accelerating mullet fish (a carangiform swimmer) and a steadily swimming eel (an anguilliform swimmer) ...|$|R

Its effects upon the length of the radicles could probably be a consequence of the effects upon cellular division in combination with effects on cellular wall extensibility. Many a dysfunction created by lead may be due to effects upon the integrity of the plasmatic membrane, as was observed by root tip dying (vital staining). By determining the hydraulic parameters through pressure probe techniques we were able to show that the mechanisms that govern the hydric behavior of this organ are complex and respond to many factors and that they do not obey to action upon the aquaporins. Exposing the root to different divalent metals makes it more vulnerable to attack by other heavy metals, as has been shown by the effects added by exposing the roots to HgCl 2 By using IRGA (infrared gas analyzer) techniques we have been able to show that lead at low concentrations may attack important physiological processes such as the photosynthetic activity of the plant, directly and or indirectly. By analyzing the contents of Pb in the plant, through the exude of xylem and the nutritive solution we were able to verify that the chelating agent EDTA may effectively reduce the toxicity of lead, while at the same time finding a mechanisms of Pb detoxification through the formation of a Pb complexes probably exuded by the roots that was also present in the translocated xylem solution.
