5|$|The now-common <b>trope</b> {{of dinosaurs}} {{existing}} in isolated locations in today's world {{appeared at the}} same time, with Arthur Conan Doyle's 1912 book The Lost World and the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs as pioneers. The Lost World crossed into the movies in 1925, setting heights for special effects and attempts at scientific accuracy. It is unusual, even today, for attempting to portray dinosaurs as something other than monsters that spent their lives in combat.|$|E
5|$|Christie's {{sacrifice}} {{in the film}} is a heavily criticized plot element, with critics from online publications such as Cracked.com and Bloody Disgusting calling it avoidable and unnecessary. In Keyframes: Popular Cinema and Cultural Studies, Matthew Tinkcom and Amy Villarejo write that Christie reinforces an Alien-franchise <b>trope</b> (shared by Parker in Alien and Dillon in Alien 3) where black characters save and sacrifice themselves for Caucasian characters. The theme of hybridization is exemplified by Christie and Vriess, according to Rizzo in Deleuze and Film: A Feminist Introduction; while the two characters are harnessed together, they alternate movement, support and combat.|$|E

40|$|We {{argue that}} if one wishes to be a realist, one should adopt a Neo-Aristotelian {{ontology}} involving <b>tropes</b> instead of a Russellian ontology of property universals and objects. Either Russellian realists should adopt the relata-specific relational <b>tropes</b> of instantiation instead of facts, or convert to Neo-Aristotelian realism with monadic <b>tropes.</b> Regarding Neo-Aristotelian realism, we have two novel points why it fares better than Russellian realism. Instantiation of property universals by <b>tropes</b> and characterization or inherence between <b>tropes</b> and objects are more transparent ontological notions than relational inherence, which is assumed in Russellian realism with the relational <b>tropes</b> of instantiation. Neo-Aristotelian realism makes better sense about abstract universals, which are a more viable option than concrete universals...|$|R

5|$|Elizabeth Bear's Carnival (2006) revisits the <b>trope</b> of the single-gender world, {{as a pair}} of {{gay male}} ambassador-spies attempt to {{infiltrate}} and subvert the predominately lesbian civilization of New Amazonia, whose matriarchal rulers have all but enslaved their men. In 2007, J.K. Rowling's statement that Albus Dumbledore, a character in her Harry Potter series, was gay caused some controversy. Sarah Hall's dystopian novel The Carhullan Army (2007), published in the US under the title Daughters of the North, matter of factly features lesbians as primary characters. The novel won the 2007 John Llewellyn Rhys Prize and James Tiptree, Jr. Award, and was shortlisted for the 2008 Arthur C. Clarke Award. It is perhaps telling of the evolution of public perception of same sex relationships that the relationships are unmentioned or only peripherally noted in reviews.|$|E
5|$|Hanegraaff {{identified}} the second main healing current in the New Age movement as being holistic health. This {{emerged in the}} 1970s out of the free clinic movement of the 1960s, and has various connections with the Human Potential Movement. It emphasises {{the idea that the}} human individual is a holistic, interdependent relationship between mind, body, and spirit, and that healing is a process in which an individual becomes whole by integrating with the powers of the universe. A very wide array of methods are utilised within the holistic health movement, {{with some of the most}} common including acupuncture, reiki, biofeedback, chiropractic, yoga, kinesiology, homeopathy, aromatherapy iridology, massage and other forms of bodywork, meditation and visualisation, nutritional therapy, psychic healing, herbal medicine, healing using crystals, metals, music, chromotherapy, and reincarnation therapy. The use of crystal healing has become a particularly prominent visual <b>trope</b> within the New Age; this practice was not common in esotericism prior to their adoption in the New Age milieu.|$|E
5|$|Heinlein {{draws an}} analogy between the human {{society in the}} novel, which is well-to-do but needs to be {{vigilant}} against the imperialist threat of the Arachnids, and U.S. society of the 1950s. Reviewers {{have suggested that the}} Arachnids are Heinlein's analogue for communists. Traits used to support this include the communal nature of the Arachnids, which makes them capable of a much higher degree of coordination than the humans. Bug society is once explicitly described as communist, and is moreover depicted as communist by nature; this has been read as implying that those with a different political ideology are analogous to alien beings. The related motifs of alien invasion, of being patriotic to one's people, and personal sacrifice during war, are present, as are other aspects of U.S. popular culture of the 1950s. Commentators have argued that Heinlein's portrayal of aliens, as well as being a reference to people in communist countries, invokes the <b>trope</b> of a return to the frontier. The concept of the frontier includes a social-Darwinist argument of constantly fighting for survival, even at the expense of indigenous people or, in the case of Starship Troopers, of aliens. Heinlein suggests that without territorial expansion involving violent conquest of other races, humans would be destroyed. Scholar Jamie King has stated that Heinlein does not address the question of what the military government and Federal Service would do in peacetime, and argues that Heinlein has set up a society designed to be continuously at war, and to keep expanding its territory.|$|E

The second chapter is entitled: “Tropes and their components” and it consists of two sections; the first section is entitled: “the definition of tropes”. This section deals with the definition of “literal expressions” and “figurative expressions”, and the required condition for figurative expressions; that is the syntactical and semantic coherence and relationships.

The Caucasian group valued the <b>tropes</b> for their currency in today’s slang, but hinted that the language was less than standard.

40|$|Rhetorical <b>tropes</b> like {{metaphors and}} irony {{are widely used}} in print {{advertising}}. Current advertising literature assumes that these different <b>tropes</b> (metaphor, irony) are persuasive when they are sufficiently novel and complex to increase advertising elaboration. However, we propose that, in some cases, <b>tropes</b> can also be persuasive when they present conventional and concrete images of abstract product qualities. To test if conventionality can explain the persuasiveness of various <b>tropes</b> (metaphor, irony), we conducted a 2 (conventional metaphor vs. no metaphor) £ 2 (conventional irony vs. no irony) multiple-message experiment. Results demonstrate that conventional metaphors are persuasive by reducing complexity and increasing creativity and ad appreciation. Conventional irony, in contrast, has little effect on persuasiveness. Thus, differentiating between various <b>tropes</b> (metaphor, irony) is important in predicting persuasion effects: advertisers should refrain from using conventional irony, but including conventional metaphors about abstract product qualities in print advertising is advisable...|$|R
