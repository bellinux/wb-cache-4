5|$|Originally, {{the grass}} on <b>the</b> <b>putting</b> greens was the wide-bladed Bermuda. The greens lost speed, {{especially}} during the late 1970s, after {{the introduction of a}} healthier strain of narrow-bladed Bermuda, which thrived and grew thicker. In 1978, the greens on the par 3 course were reconstructed with bentgrass, a narrow-bladed species that could be mowed shorter, eliminating grain. After this test run, the greens on the main course were replaced with bentgrass in time for the 1981 Masters. The bentgrass resulted in significantly faster putting surfaces, which has required a reduction in some of the contours of the greens over time.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>put</b> buyer/owner {{is short}} on the {{underlying}} asset of <b>the</b> <b>put,</b> but long on <b>the</b> <b>put</b> option itself. That is, the buyer wants {{the value of}} <b>the</b> <b>put</b> option to increase by {{a decline in the}} price of the underlying asset below the strike price. The writer (seller) of a put is long on the underlying asset and short on <b>the</b> <b>put</b> option itself. That is, the seller wants the option to become worthless by an increase in the price of the underlying asset above the strike price. Generally, a put option that is purchased is referred to as a long put and a put option that is sold is referred to as a short put.|$|R
25|$|Grass on {{golf courses}} {{is kept in}} three {{distinct}} conditions: that of the rough, the fairway, and <b>the</b> <b>putting</b> green. Grass on the fairway is mown short and even, allowing the player to strike the ball cleanly. Playing from the rough is a disadvantage because the long grass may affect the flight of the ball. Grass on <b>the</b> <b>putting</b> green is the shortest and most even, ideally allowing the ball to roll smoothly over the surface. An entire industry revolves around the development and marketing of grass varieties for golf courses.|$|E

50|$|Put {{options are}} most {{commonly}} used {{in the stock market}} to protect against the decline of the price of a stock below a specified price. If the price of the stock declines below the specified price of <b>the</b> <b>put</b> option, <b>the</b> owner/buyer of <b>the</b> <b>put</b> has <b>the</b> right, but not the obligation, to sell the asset at the specified price, while the seller of <b>the</b> <b>put</b> has <b>the</b> obligation to purchase the asset at the strike price if the owner uses the right to do so (the owner/buyer is said to exercise <b>the</b> <b>put</b> or put option). In this way the buyer of <b>the</b> <b>put</b> will receive at least the strike price specified, even if the asset is currently worthless.|$|R

50|$|Using <b>the</b> <b>PUT</b> method consumes more {{bandwidth}} {{as compared}} to the PATCH method when only a few changes need to be applied to a resource. But when the PATCH method is used, it usually involves fetching the resource from the server, comparing the original and new files, creating and sending a diff file. On the server side,the server has to read the diff file and make the modifications. This involves a lot of overhead compared to <b>the</b> <b>PUT</b> method.On <b>the</b> other hand, <b>the</b> <b>PUT</b> method requires a GET to be performed before <b>the</b> <b>PUT</b> {{and it is difficult to}} ensure that the resource is not modified between <b>the</b> GET and <b>PUT</b> requests.|$|R
50|$|The seller's {{potential}} loss on a naked put can be substantial. If the stock falls {{all the way}} to zero (bankruptcy), his loss is equal to the strike price (at which he must buy the stock to cover the option) minus the premium received. The potential upside is the premium received when selling the option: if the stock price is above the strike price at expiration, the option seller keeps the premium, and the option expires worthless. During the option's lifetime, if the stock moves lower, the option's premium may increase (depending on how far the stock falls and how much time passes). If it does, it becomes more costly to close the position (repurchase <b>the</b> <b>put,</b> sold earlier), resulting in a loss. If the stock price completely collapses before <b>the</b> <b>put</b> position is closed, <b>the</b> <b>put</b> writer potentially can face catastrophic loss. In order to protect <b>the</b> <b>put</b> buyer from default, <b>the</b> <b>put</b> writer is required to post margin. <b>The</b> <b>put</b> buyer does not need to post margin because the buyer would not exercise the option if it had a negative payoff.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} actions by the British forces and Canadian Militia during this period was <b>the</b> <b>putting</b> down of the Rebellions of 1837. The Upper Canada Rebellion was quickly and decisively defeated by the British forces and Canadian Militia. Attacks the next year by Hunters' Lodges, US irregulars who expected to be paid in Canadian land, were crushed in 1838 in the Battle of Pelee Island and the Battle of the Windmill. The Lower Canada Rebellion was a greater threat to the British, and the rebels were victorious at the Battle of St. Denis on November 23, 1837. Two days later, the rebels were defeated at the Battle of Saint-Charles, and on December 14, they were finally routed at the Battle of Saint-Eustache.|$|E
40|$|Enteric {{bacteria}} can grow on proline {{as the sole}} nitrogen and carbon source. Expression of <b>the</b> proline utilization (<b>put)</b> operon in Klebsiella strains and Escherichia coli is responsive to nitrogen regulation. In contrast, Salmonella typhimurium cannot activate put operon expression when growing in medium with glucose as a carbon source and proline as the sole nitrogen source. To compare nitrogen regulatory sites in the control regions of <b>the</b> <b>put</b> operons in these three closely related genera, we cloned <b>the</b> Klebsiella <b>put</b> operon onto a plasmid. The putA and putP genes were localized on the plasmid by transposon mutagenesis. The DNA sequence of <b>the</b> <b>put</b> control region was determined and {{compared with those of}} <b>the</b> <b>put</b> control regions from S. typhimurium and E. coli. The overall size and organization of <b>the</b> <b>put</b> control region were very similar in all three bacteria. However, no obvious ntr regulatory sites were found in this region, and transcription of <b>the</b> <b>put</b> genes started at the same sites during growth with limiting or excess nitrogen. These results strongly suggested that <b>the</b> Klebsiella <b>put</b> operon may not be directly regulated by the ntr system...|$|R
40|$|PutA from Escherichia coli {{functions}} {{both as a}} membrane-associated multifunctional enzyme and a transcriptional repressor of <b>the</b> <b>put</b> regulon, which encodes the putA and putP genes. The intracellular localization {{and function}} of PutA is regulated by the availability of proline. ^ In this study, we investigated how PutA represses <b>the</b> <b>put</b> regulon in <b>the</b> absence of proline. First, we localized the PutA-DNA binding domain to the N-terminal 47 amino acids and clearly demonstrated that PutA belongs {{to a member of}} the ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) family transcription factors. Second, we identified five PutA binding sites on <b>the</b> <b>put</b> control DNA region and studied the roles of these binding sites in the regulation of the putA or putP genes. We found that PutA binds to two of the binding sites to repress the putP gene and the other three sites to repress the putA gene expression. ^ We also explored how PutA switches its localization and function in the presence of proline. Proline reduces the PutA flavin cofactor which induces PutA-membrane binding, where PutA catalyzes the two-step oxidation of proline to glutamate. The PutA-membrane interaction probably leads to a conformational change so that PutA can 2 ̆ 7 t interact with DNA, therefore, releasing the repression of <b>the</b> <b>put</b> genes. ^ Further, we studied how <b>the</b> <b>put</b> genes are regulated by carbon and nitrogen sources. We provided the first evidence that the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) regulates <b>the</b> <b>put</b> genes as an activator by directly interacting with <b>the</b> <b>put</b> control DNA. We also explored whether the nitrogen assimilation control protein (NAC) regulates <b>the</b> <b>put</b> genes. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{mutation}} {{has been}} identified that prevents Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells from growing on proline as the sole source of nitrogen, causes noninducible expression of <b>the</b> <b>PUT</b> 1 and PUT 2 genes, and is completely recessive. In <b>the</b> <b>put</b> 3 - 75 mutant, the basal level of expression (ammonia as nitrogen source) of PUT 1 -lacZ and PUT 2 -lacZ gene fusions as measured by β-galactosidase activity is reduced 4 - and 7 -fold, respectively, compared with the wild-type strain. Normal regulation is not restored when the cells are grown on arginine as the sole nitrogen source and put 3 - 75 cells remain sensitive to the proline analog, l-azetidine- 2 -carboxylic acid, indicating that the block is not {{at the level of}} transport of the inducer, proline. In a cross between <b>the</b> <b>put</b> 3 - 75 strain and the semidominant, constitutive mutation PUT 3 c- 68, only parental ditype tetrads were found, indicating allelism of the two mutations. Further support for allelism derives from the comparison of enzyme levels in heteroallelic and heterozygous diploid strains. The constitutive allele appears to be fully dominant to the noninducible allele but only partially dominant to the wild type, suggesting an interaction between <b>the</b> wild-type and <b>PUT</b> 3 c- 68 gene products. <b>The</b> <b>PUT</b> 3 gene maps on chromosome XI, about 5. 7 cM from the centromere. The phenotypes of alleles of <b>the</b> <b>PUT</b> 3 gene, either recessive and noninducible (<b>the</b> <b>put</b> 3 - 75 phenotype) or semidominant and constitutive (<b>the</b> <b>PUT</b> 3 c- 68 phenotype), and their pleiotropy suggest that <b>the</b> <b>PUT</b> 3 gene product is a positive activator of the proline utilization pathway...|$|R
