5|$|Pećanac was {{eventually}} denounced as a traitor by the Yugoslav government-in-exile, and the Germans concluded that his detachments were inefficient, unreliable, and of little {{military aid to}} them. <b>The</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> puppet government disbanded the organisation between September 1942 and March 1943, and Pećanac was interned for some time afterwards before being killed in mid-1944 by forces loyal to his Chetnik rival Draža Mihailović.|$|E

On 12 April, at 5 a.m. 2,000–3,000 German {{soldiers}} from the Brigade von Tshirsky attacked the city from the north-west, supported via the Helsinki-Turku railway. The Germans broke through the area between Munkkiniemi and Pasila, and advanced on the central-western parts of the town. The German naval squadron Meurer blocked the city harbour, bombarded the southern town area, and landed naval troops at Katajanokka.|$|E

5|$|In the Soviet Union, both <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Soviets {{spent the}} {{spring and early summer}} of 1943 {{preparing}} for large offensives in central Russia. On 4 July 1943, Germany attacked Soviet forces around the Kursk Bulge. Within a week, German forces had exhausted themselves against the Soviets' deeply echeloned and well-constructed defences and, {{for the first time in}} the war, Hitler cancelled the operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success. This decision was partially affected by the Western Allies' invasion of Sicily launched on 9 July which, combined with previous Italian failures, resulted in the ousting and arrest of Mussolini later that month. Also, in July 1943 the British firebombed Hamburg killing over 40,000 people.|$|E
5|$|On 25 June 1916, Brussels left Hoek van Holland {{bound for}} Harwich. Lights were shown {{from the beach}} and a flare was fired.

The passengers were told to prepare to take to the lifeboats and orders were given for official papers to be destroyed, which was done successfully.

5|$|Div Cav {{spent the}} first three weeks of the pursuit camped near Bardia. On 2 December, as part of the {{outflanking}} move around El Agheila, the regiment began an eight-day drive on transporters to El Haseiat. After unloading its vehicles, the regiment continued its flanking movement. On 14 December, it was placed under the command of the 4th Light Armoured Brigade, with which it spent the night. C Squadron screened the brigade in the morning and by 16:00 the regiment had drawn away from the brigade as C Squadron reached the escarpment. The German 15th Panzer Division, halted on the road due to a fuel shortage, was targeted by Div Cav. During the night, the regiment withdrew and laagered while the Germans retreated. At 05:45 the next morning, XXX Corps headquarters ordered the division to attack <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> regiment was advised to expect an attack from the east by a hundred tanks. Div Cav was ordered to withdraw south-west, along the line of its previous advance. When the regiment had gone back , it surprised a German column. ASquadron engaged, as the other squadrons hastily withdrew. In the evening, the regiment advanced a mile west and laagered.|$|E
5|$|From late February to mid-March, the 2nd New Zealand Division was {{transferred}} to Syria. The Allied high command was concerned that the Middle East was at risk from an invasion by <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> New Zealanders {{were part of the}} force tasked with blocking their likely route from the Caucasus. The 25th Battalion was stationed close to the border with Turkey, near the town of Idlib, and its platoons manned frontier posts for several weeks. The battalion later shifted to the Djedeide fortress area where it would prepare defences. However, following the attack on the 8th Army's Gazala Line by Panzer Army Africa, the 2nd New Zealand Division was recalled to Egypt. By the end of June, the 25th Battalion, {{along with the rest of}} the 6th Brigade, was setting up camp in the Alamein area.|$|E
5|$|From {{the summer}} of 1940, the Committee became {{increasingly}} divided between the members keen for closer collaboration with the Germans, led by Victor Leemans, and those who wished to remain strictly within the proscribed Belgian legal framework, led by Ernst de Bunswyck. In October 1940, the Germans were able to pass fundamental changes to the system of regional Burgomasters in the country though the Committee without resistance. The Committee had announced in October 1940 that it would refuse to enforce anti-Jewish legislation, but did not resist their implementation by the military government. The Committee's ambivalent stance meant that Belgian policemen and civil servants were not instructed to refuse to participate in rounding-up of Jews {{as part of the}} Final Solution from 1942. Tensions grew between <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> committee in December 1940, and in early 1941 the Germans reshuffled the committee; appointing more pro-Nazi members. From March 1941, {{it became clear that the}} Committee would no longer be able to resist German demands, even those clearly violating the Hague Convention.|$|E

5|$|On {{the evening}} of 22 July, she was {{flagship}} of Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt, commander of the Harwich Force, as he took Carysfort, her half-sister , and eight destroyers to sea to patrol the sea lanes between Felixstowe and the Dutch coast. He split his forces to cover the two routes involved and encountered three German torpedo boats en route to attack merchant shipping in that area around 01:15 of the following morning. Hampered by an inopportune rain squall and a German smoke screen, Tyrwhitt's ships were only able to engage the Germans {{for a short time}} before they disengaged. Tyrwhitt then ordered Canterbury and her escort to intercept the fleeing Germans; they spotted six torpedo boats about a half-hour later and opened fire at 02:02. Visibility was poor because of another smoke screen laid by <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> British ships were forced to disengage without inflicting any damage at 02:25 as they were approaching a minefield.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Canadian Battalion {{successfully}} {{destroyed the}} bridges at Varaville and Robehomme after {{landing on the}} northern DZ. They then withdrew to defend Le Mesnil, where the brigade headquarters and the field ambulance were located. Meanwhile, by 02:50 only 150 men of the 9th Parachute Battalion had gathered at their assembly area, with virtually no heavy weapons or supplies. Unable to wait any longer, they headed for the Merville Gun Battery. The battalion captured the battery, but without explosives, could only damage two of its four guns. The battle had been costly, and only 85 men were left to head for their secondary objective, the village of Le Plein. The village was defended in strength by <b>the</b> <b>Germans,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> weakened battalion could only dig in and wait the arrival of commandos from the 1st Special Service Brigade later that day. By nightfall the brigade was deployed facing east, along the ridge of high ground from Le Plein in the north to the Bois de Bavent in the south.|$|E
5|$|The Nationalist and Popular armies also {{designed}} and manufactured {{a number of}} their own tanks. The Nationalists, for example, began the war with three Trubia A4 prototypes, manufactured {{before the beginning of}} the conflict. They also completed the first prototype of the Verdeja light tank. This was designed to overcome the shortcomings of tanks provided by <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Italians, as well as Soviet tanks captured from the Popular Front. Popular Front production of armored vehicles was segmented throughout different areas of Spain. In the north, between 15 and 20 Carro Trubia-Naval tanks were manufactured at the factory in Sestao, conversely the Trubia factory had built only a single model Landesa tank. In Catalonia, two tanks were produced by the Maquinaría Moderna factory in Sant Sadurní d'Anoia. Though the Popular Front designed and manufactured many more armored fighting vehicles than the Nationalists, this ultimately worked in the Nationalists favor as the factories and their production lines were captured intact during the war.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} lightly damaged by saboteurs in December which {{disrupted}} progress and the Regia Marina decided to suspend construction in April 1942 as she remained {{nearly two years}} from completion. By late 1942, the Regia Marinas shortage of destroyers had reached a point that every possible hull was needed and construction restarted at a high priority. This allowed her to be launched on 18 July 1943, but shortly afterwards {{a change in the}} Italian leadership caused any further work to be suspended in August and the resources used in her construction to be diverted to finish a large group of small wooden minesweepers. During the fighting between <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Italians after the Italian surrender on 9 September, Spalato was scuttled in Split harbor on 24 September. The Germans occupied Split three days later, refloated the ship several weeks later and stripped her of any valuable material. As part of their scorched-earth strategy as they abandoned Split, the Germans scuttled Spalato and wrecked the shipyard before the Yugoslav Partisans occupied the port on 27 October 1944.|$|E
5|$|Two {{resistance}} movements emerged {{following the}} invasion: the communist-led, multi-ethnic Partisans, and the royalist, Serbian nationalist Chetniks, although during 1941, within the occupied territory, even the Partisans consisted {{almost entirely of}} Serbs. The Partisans were led by the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito, while the Chetniks were led by Colonel Draža Mihailović, {{an officer in the}} interwar Royal Yugoslav Army. The two movements had widely diverging goals. Whereas the Partisans sought to turn Yugoslavia into a communist state under Tito's leadership, the Chetniks sought a return to the pre-war status quo, whereby the Yugoslav monarchy—and, by extension, Serb political hegemony—would be restored. Communist resistance commenced in early July, shortly after the invasion of the Soviet Union, targeting both <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> puppet authorities. By late August 1941, the Partisans and Chetniks were carrying out joint attacks against the Germans. The Partisans were well organised and many of their commanders had ample military experience, having fought in the Spanish Civil War. By late summer, they had 8,000fighters spread across 21detachments in Serbia alone. Many Chetniks were either veterans of the Balkan Wars and World WarI or former members of the Royal Yugoslav Army. They boasted around 20,000fighters in the German-occupied territory of Serbia {{at the time of the}} massacre.|$|E
5|$|In early July 1941, {{shortly after}} the {{launching}} of Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union, armed resistance began against both <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Aćimović authorities. This {{was a response to}} appeals from both Joseph Stalin and the Communist International for communist organisations across occupied Europe to draw German troops away from the Eastern Front, and followed a meeting of the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party in Belgrade on 4 July. This meeting resolved to shift from sabotage operations to a general uprising, form Partisan detachments of fighters and commence armed resistance, and call for the populace to rise up against the occupiers throughout Yugoslavia. This also coincided with the departure of the last of the German invasion force that had remained to oversee the transition to occupation. From the appearance of posters and pamphlets urging the population to undertake sabotage, it rapidly turned to attempted and actual sabotage of German propaganda facilities and railway and telephone lines. The first fighting occurred at the village of Bela Crkva on 7 July, when gendarmes tried to disperse a public meeting, and two gendarmes were killed. At {{the end of the first}} week in July, List requested that the Luftwaffe transfer an aircraft training school to the territory, as operational units were not available. Soon after, gendarmerie stations and patrols were being attacked, and German vehicles were fired upon. Armed groups first appeared in the Aranđelovac district, northwest of Topola.|$|E
