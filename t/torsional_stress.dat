5|$|The patagium is {{the wing}} membrane. The patagium is {{stretched}} between {{the arm and}} hand bones, down the lateral {{side of the body}} and down to the hind limbs. This skin membrane consists of connective tissue, elastic fibers, nerves, muscles, and blood vessels. The muscles keep the membrane taut during flight. The skin on the body of the bat, which has one layer of epidermis and dermis, as well as the presence of hair follicles, sweat glands and a fatty subcutaneous layer, {{is very different from the}} skin of the wing membrane. The patagium is an extremely thin double layer of epidermis; these layers are separated by a connective tissue center, rich with collagen and elastic fibers. The membrane has no hair follicles or sweat glands, except between the fingers. Unlike birds whose stiff wings deliver bending and <b>torsional</b> <b>stress</b> to the shoulders, bats have a flexible wing membrane which can only resist tension. To achieve flight, a bat exerts force inwards at the points where the membrane meets the skeleton, so that an opposing force balances it on the wing edges perpendicular to the wing surface. However, this adaptation does not permit bats to reduce their wingspan as birds do, which means they cannot travel over long distances like birds can.|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackground/ObjectiveThe {{greatest}} forces {{experienced by}} bones result from muscular contractions—muscles produce most force in high-velocity eccentric contractions. Bouncing movements, e. g., sprinting or hopping—where such contractions occur—are {{highly beneficial for}} lower limb bones. However, {{there is a growing}} body of evidence that <b>torsional</b> <b>stresses</b> are highly osteogenic. Sports in which frequent quick turning occurs—hence large <b>torsional</b> <b>stresses</b> can be expected—e. g., tennis, may also improve bone strength {{even in the absence of}} large ground reaction and muscle forces. MethodsTo investigate the relative effects of bouncing and turning movements on bones, we recruited 47 older men (mean age 62. 4  ±  12. 9 years). They were competitive sprinters (representing exposure to bouncing movement), competitive tennis players (turning movements), and inactive controls. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography scans of tibial diaphysis at 66 % distal–proximal length were taken; muscle sizes from peripheral quantitative computed tomography and countermovement jump performance were also examined. ResultsBone strength of tennis players was clearly greater than that of controls (23 % greater bone mass; p    0. 5). Material eccentricity analysis suggests that <b>torsional</b> <b>stresses</b> may be a significant adaptive stimulus to tibial bone. ConclusionResults suggest that sports with quick turning movements are highly osteogenic, even in the absence of greater muscular output.

500|$|In 2005 Therrien {{and colleagues}} {{estimated}} the relative bite force of theropods (estimates in absolute values like newtons were impossible) {{and found that}} Giganotosaurus and related taxa had adaptations for capturing and bringing down prey by delivering powerful bites, whereas tyrannosaurs had adaptations for resisting <b>torsional</b> <b>stress</b> and crushing bones. The bite force of Giganotosaurus was weaker than that of Tyrannosaurus, and the force decreased hindwards along the tooth row. The lower jaws were adapted for slicing bites, and it probably captured and manipulated prey with the front part of the jaws. These authors suggested that Giganotosaurus and other allosaurs may have been generalised predators that fed on {{a wide spectrum of}} prey smaller than themselves, such as juvenile sauropods. The ventral process (or [...] "chin") of the lower jaw may have been an adaptation for resisting tensile stress when the powerful bite was delivered with the front of the jaws against the prey.|$|E
500|$|The Constructor of the Navy, Rear Admiral Washington L. Capps, devised {{an ambitious}} design that packed {{powerful}} armament and thick armor onto the small hull. He believed that future naval battles would involve fleets rather than single-ship actions, and {{so while the}} wing turrets so common in European designs were useful in the latter role for putting a maximum amount of firepower in any given direction, they were less so when operating {{as part of a}} line of battle. [...] From this, Capps theorized that the principal concern of battleships was how much shell weight they could fire per broadside. The arrangement of superfiring turrets placed on the centerline would allow the hull to be as short as possible while still having the most powerful broadside possible. A ship with its main battery placed along the center of the ship can focus the same amount of fire to port or starboard during a broadside. This is juxtaposed against wing turrets, which had significant shortcomings: their location on the left or right of a ship's superstructure led to smaller possible broadsides, and the extreme weight placed {{on the sides of the}} ships led to <b>torsional</b> <b>stress</b> and rolling inertia.|$|E

His FORTRAN program, called 'TORSION', determined stresses in wide flange, channel, and single angle members under various longitudinal bending and torsional loadings. In order to validate the 'TORSION' program, twelve test cases were run and compared to the same cases analyzed using a commonly used manual technique. For this manual technique, the Torsional Analysis Case Charts, developed by Bethlehem Steel were used to compute warping and <b>torsional</b> <b>stresses.</b> Tables comparing the calculated stresses by the 'TORSION' program and the torsion tables were developed.

40|$|Torsionally {{stressed}} DNA plays {{a critical}} role in genome organization and regulation. While the ef-fects of <b>torsional</b> <b>stresses</b> on naked DNA have been well studied, little is known about how these stresses propagate within chromatin and affect its organiza-tion. Here we investigate the torsional behavior of nucleosome arrays by means of Brownian dynam-ics simulations of a coarse-grained model of chro-matin. Our simulations reveal a strong dependence of the torsional response on the rotational phase an-gle Ψ 0 between adjacent nucleosomes. Extreme val-ues of Ψ 0 lead to asymmetric, bell-shaped extension-rotation profiles with sharp maxima shifted toward positive or negative rotations, depending on the sign of Ψ 0, and to fast, irregular propagation of DNA twist. In contrast, moderate Ψ 0 yield more symmetric pro-files with broad maxima and slow, uniform propa-gation of twist. The observed behavior is shown to arise from an interplay between nucleosomal transi-tions into states with crossed and open linker DNAs and global supercoiling of arrays into left- and right-handed coils, where Ψ 0 serves to modulate the en-ergy landscape of nucleosomal states. Our results also explain the torsional resilience of chromatin, reconcile differences between experimentally mea-sured extension-rotation profiles, and suggest a role of <b>torsional</b> <b>stresses</b> in regulating chromatin assem-bly and organization...|$|R

If a wheel is ridden with this <b>torsional</b> <b>stress</b> left in the spokes, they may untwist and cause the wheel to become out of true. Bladed and ovalized spokes may be held straight with an appropriate tool as the nipple is turned.

40|$|This topical report {{summarizes}} {{the work on}} angled crack growth and combined loading effects performed within the Nuclear Regulatory Commission`s research program entitled {open_quotes}Short Cracks in Piping and Piping Welds{close_quotes}. The major impetus for this work stemmed from the observation that initial circumferential cracks in carbon steel pipes exhibited angular crack growth. This failure mode was little understood, {{and the effect of}} angled crack growth from an initially circumferential crack raised questions of how pipes under combined loading with <b>torsional</b> <b>stresses</b> would behave. There were three major conclusions from this work. The first was that virtually all ferritic nuclear pipes will have toughness anisotropy. The second was that the ratio of the normalized crack driving force (as a function of angle) to the normalized toughness (also {{as a function of the}} angle of crack growth) showed that there was an equal likelihood of cracks growing at any angle between 25 and 65 degrees. This agreed with the scatter of crack growth angles observed in pipe tests.
