Dead-end OSN gave the expected rejections of 97 – 99 % for bases larger than the MWCO, except TDDA, which unexpectedly had an average rejection of only 19 %. MWCO therefore does not accurately represent the selectivity of StarMem™ 122. To investigate the reasons for this, cross-flow OSN of the same <b>trialkylamine</b> bases was conducted. This did not give a low TDDA rejection however, and the rejections {{of all the other}} bases were lower than in dead-end OSN.

40|$|Substituted heterocycles {{are common}} building-blocks for biologically {{relevant}} molecules and represent challenging synthetic targets. Due to limited methods available for their preparation and derivatization, direct C-H functionalization protocols offer considerable advantages. Radical chemistry has shown great potential in this regard; however traditional approaches are unattractive due to poor selectivity and harsh reaction conditions. Visible light photoredox catalysis, {{on the other}} hand, is a mild alternative for alkyl radical generation and has proven its utility in organic synthesis. The work encompassed in this thesis details the efforts towards the development of practical photoredox-based functionalizations of heterocycles. Specific focus is placed upon overcoming obstacles pertaining to H-atom abstraction, back electron transfer, and redox strength of photocatalysts to achieve efficient C-Br bond reductions, amine oxidations, and C-C bond formations. In pursuit of these objectives, a C 2 -selective malonation of indoles and other electron-rich heteroarenes was accomplished in high yields using photocatalyst Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2, p-CH 3 OC 6 H 4 NPh, and blue LEDs as the light source. Use of a triarylamine over a <b>trialkylamine</b> suppressed H-atom abstraction and promoted C-C bond formation. Subsequent exploitation of the reductive quenching cycle of Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 and use of Cl 3 CBr as an alternative oxidant led to an oxidative nucleophilic trapping of tetrahydroisoquinolines to provide a diverse set of analogues.

Interest in these materials arises from their electrically conducting properties and the fact that at low temperatures many such salts exhibit superconductivity. New electron acceptors are sought in an attempt to raise the temperature at which onset of superconductivity is observed. Our approach has been to investigate the synthesis of heterocyclic analogues of TCNQ, in which isoelectromc replacement of a double bond jt-electron pair has been achieved by a heteroatom carrying a lone pair of electrons capable of 71 -type conjugation. Condensation of maleic anhydride with malonomtrile, followed by treatment of the resultant salt with thionyl chloride yielded a dicyanomethylene lactone whose synthesis and chemistry was investigated as a potential precursor to the desired TCNQ analogues. The lactone reacts with alcohols and amines under mild conditions to give the corresponding hydroxy esters and amides respectively Cyclisation of the hydroxy esters was attempted by converting them to amide esters at elevated temperatures. However, thermal decomposition of the amide esters resulted and product isolation was impossible. New heterocyclic TCNQ systems based on pyrazine were also synthesised For example, 5, 6 -diphenyl- 2, 3 -dicyanopyrazine was reacted with ammonia gas and condensation of the resultant dnmino derivative with malonomtrile gave the bis(dicyanomethylene) ammonium salt.

The extent of dealkylation {{was found to}} be linked to temperature with ca. 10 % octene liberation from tri-n-octylborane at 150 ºC in the absence of bulk solvent. Analysis of the oxidised samples from the dealkylation investigation shows that, whereas the control experiment shows no back-isomerisation of tri-n-octylborane at 150 ºC, the addition of 10 mol% of DMF, DMSO, HMPA and trimethoxyphosphate results in back-isomerisation of the alkyl chain. In general, the addition of Lewis base catalyst was found to enhance the extent of dealkylation. In a supporting 11 B NMR spectroscopy study to understand the interaction of trialkylboranes and Lewis bases, the interactions of a series of oxygen and phosphorous donor Lewis bases with tri-n-butylborane were found to be favourable, as indicated by large negative binding enthalpy (HBIND) and entropy (SBIND) values. Only the <b>trialkylamine</b> Lewis bases were found to have unfavourable interactions with tri-nbutylborane, as indicated by positive HBIND and SBIND values. The results also show that the chemical shift of the adduct at infinite dilution (11 B =) is not as reliable a measure of the interaction between the two species and that correlation of binding constant (logKBIND) at 25. 0 ºC to GBIND defines a linear trend that orders the Lewis bases according to spontaneity of the interaction with the strength of the dative bond formed. The applicability of 11 B NMR spectroscopy {{to the study of the}} reactions of boranes and alkylboranes was extended to the investigation of the reduction of nitriles by BH 3. SMe 2 in dichloromethane (15 - 30 ºC). Results from the kinetic study indicate that the overall reduction with BH 3.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) on 9 finds E 1 / 2 ox is 0. 88 V, which is consistent with the inductive effect of the 1, 3 -dihydroxy- 2 -propyl groups attached to nitrogen. It is also observed that the electrochemical oxidation of 9 is reversible on the CV time scale. The 15 N NMR chemical shift of the essentially planar nitrogen atom of 9 is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} for SN 2 nucleophilic substitution {{reaction of}} sodium benzoate with benzyl bromide catalyzed by immobilized phase-transfer catalyst was investigated. The support of solid phase-transfer catalyst was prepared from the copolymerization of polystyrene and chloromethylstyrene. Different functional groups {{were used as}} the active centers, such as <b>trialkylamines,</b> trioctylphosphine or triphenylphosphine, and that was immobilized {{onto the surface of}} the macroporous or microporous catalysts. In solid-liquid-liquid system, the product yield was obtained above 86 % within 3 hr of reaction using small amount of solid catalyst with the properties of 1. 38 % divinylbenzene crosslinked, particle size of 40 - 80 mesh,tributylamine activated, and macropore-mouth type, and the overall reaction rate decreased with increasing the mean particle size. This demonstrates that the esterification of sodium benzoate is controlled by the combination of intraparticle diffusion and intrinsic reaction under triphase conditions. Moreover, the characteristics and structure of the catalyst support also affect the catalytic efficiency. With the same degree of crosslinking, macroporous catalyst with tributylamine activated has higher activities than microporous catalyst does. The effects of operating parameters, including agitation speed, reaction temperature, amounts of catalyst, types of solvents, molar ratio of reactants, type of phase-transfer catalysts, volume ratio of aqueous, and so on, were all performed to find the optimal reaction conditions. With increasing of agitation speed, reaction temperature and amounts of catalyst, the reaction rate increased. The catalytic efficiency of functional group used as trioctylphosphine was best than <b>trialkylamines.</b> The ion-exchange reaction is one of the fundamental process of solid-liquid-liquid triphase reactions. We also proceed the ion-exchange reaction by triphase catalysts for sodium benzoate solution to know the formation and variation of the active intermediate (PhCOOQ) during the reaction. After induction period in 3 minutes, the active intermediate of the solid catalyst with 1. 38 % divinylbenzene crosslinked and macroporous type was also observed to keep at a near constant concentration. With increasing of cross-linking level, the formation of the active intermediate decreased. A kinetic model was developed to describe this esterification conducted in the solid-liquid-liquid triphase system, and the experimental data were well described by the pseudo-first-order kinetics. Eventually, the methods of reuse and regeneration of the catalyst was also explored to reach the purpose of lowering processing cost and saving resources. 本研究探討的是於固定化相間轉移觸媒催化下進行苯甲酸鈉與溴化苯甲基之SN 2 親核取代反應，所使用之固體觸媒擔體是將苯乙烯及氯甲基苯乙烯進行共聚合反應而得，且使用不同官能基前驅物，如三級胺、三正辛基膦或三苯基膦，將其固定於巨孔口型或微孔口型觸媒的表面上，形成活性中心。在固-液-液相催化反應系統中，只需使用少量粒徑大小為 40 - 80 mesh與 1. 38 %交聯度之三正丁基季銨基巨孔口型固體觸媒，在反應三小時後產率即可達到 86 %以上，且總反應速率隨平均粒徑的增加而降低，顯示出在三相反應系統下，苯甲酸鈉之酯化反應同時受到顆粒內部擴散與本質反應之影響。然而觸媒之特性與結構也會影響觸媒反應活性，相同交聯度且官能基團為三正丁基季銨基時，巨孔口型觸媒活性較微孔口型觸媒催化活性為佳，以及探討操作變數的影響，包括攪拌效應、觸媒添加量效應、水量添加效應、有機溶劑種類效應、觸媒種類效應、溫度效應等，進而得到較適當的反應條件；隨著攪拌速率和溫度提高，觸媒添加量增加，反應速率隨之增快，當觸媒官能機使用為三級膦之反應效率較三級胺為佳。 離子交換反應也是重要的反應過程之一，故使用三相觸媒對苯甲酸鈉進行離子交換反應，可知在反應過程中觸媒中間體(QPhCOO) 形成及變化情形；於 3 分鐘後其活性中間體就已經幾乎達定值，且隨著交聯度增加，形成觸媒活性中間體量隨之降低。提出此取代酯化反應之動力學模式，且由實驗結果知可由虛擬一階反應動力式可完整描述。 最後探討觸媒之再生還原方法，以達到降低成本及節省資源，進而改善傳統製成的目的。中文摘要 [...] Ⅰ 英文摘要 [...] Ⅱ 誌 謝 [...] Ⅳ 目 錄 [...] Ⅴ 圖 目 錄 [...] Ⅷ 表 目 錄 [...] ⅩⅢ 符號說明 [...] ⅩⅤ 第一章 緒論 1. 1. 前言 [...] 1 1. 2. 相間轉移催化反應簡介 [...] 2 1. 3. 液-液相催化反應 [...] - 10 1. 4. 固-液-液相催化反應 [...] 15 1. 5. 本實驗之研究目的與方法 [...] 18 第二章 實驗部份 2. 1. 實驗藥品 [...] 20 2. 2. 實驗裝置與儀器 [...] 21 2. 3. 產物之合成 [...] 22 2. 4. 校正曲線 [...] 23 2. 5. 高分子擔體之製備 [...] 23 2. 6. 官能基之固定化 [...] 27 2. 7. 固定化觸媒之氯離子定量方法之步驟 [...] 27 2. 8. 固定化觸媒之離子交換反應步驟 [...] 28 2. 9. 反應動力實驗步驟 [...] 30 第三章 固定化相間轉移觸媒之特性分析 3. 1. 固定化觸媒之氯離子含量結果分析 [...] 36 3. 2. 觸媒擔體不同聚合條件分析 [...] 41 3. 3. 觸媒擔體顆粒粒徑分析 [...] 41 3. 4. 觸媒BET表面積、孔洞體積和孔徑分析 [...] - 42 3. 5. 穿透式電子顯微鏡(TEM) 分析 [...] - 48 3. 6. 掃描式電子顯微鏡(SEM) 分析 [...] - 50 3. 7. 結論 [...] 56 第四章 固定化觸媒催化苯甲酸之酯化反應動力學 4. 1. 前言 [...] 58 4. 2. 反應動力模式推導 [...] 59 4. 3. 攪拌速率之效應 [...] 63 4. 4. 不同交聯度對觸媒活性中間體變化之影響 [...] 66 4. 5. 觸媒使用量的影響 [...] 76 4. 6. 觸媒顆粒大小對視反應速率之影響 [...] 76 4. 7. 不同官能基觸媒之催化反應效率 [...] 87 4. 8. 不同溶劑之影響 [...] 105 4. 9. 其他操作變數對視反應速率之影響 [...] 112 4. 10. 結論 [...] - 119 第五章 固定化觸媒之回收與再生 5. 1. 前言 [...] 124 5. 2. 固定化觸媒活性中間體之催化活性 [...] 124 5. 3. 固定化觸媒之回收與其催化活性 [...] 131 5. 4. 固定化觸媒之離子交換再生反應 [...] 136 5. 5. 再生觸媒之催化活性 [...] 139 5. 6. 結論 [...] 142 第六章 總結 [...] 144 參考文獻 [...] 149 附錄A. 苯甲酸苯甲酯之 1 HNMR圖譜 [...] - 15...|$|R

The receptor-based membrane sensors {{in use today}} are characterized by wide ranges of linear response, high selectivities, and low detection limits. However, when these sensors are used directly in environmental or biological samples, they exhibit drift and loss of selectivity over time, which both limits their ability to measure ions and their life expectancy. Previous work has shown {{that this sort of}} sensor biofouling is primarily caused by the extraction of hydrophobic, nonionic lipids into the sensing membrane, which is usually made of lipophilic materials. In this research, a new class of ion-selective electrodes incorporating perfluorinated sensor matrixes was developed with a view to eliminate sensor biofouling. Perfluorinated phases are the most nonpolar compounds known. In fact, they have such low polarity that just as water and oil separate when mixed together due to the high polarity of water, octane and perfluorooctane do not mix precisely because octane is too polar. These highly nonpolar materials form a third class of solubility preference in addition to those of "aqueous" and "organic", termed “fluorous”. Along with the improved biofouling characteristics expected of ISEs containing fluorous matrixes, they also exhibit enhanced selectivity and wider measuring ranges. Sodium tetrakis[3, 5 -bis(perfluorohexyl) phenyl]borate and the new salt tris{ 3, 5 - bis[(perfluorooctyl) propyl]phenyl}methylphosphonium methyl sulfate were used as fluorophilic anionic and cationic sites in fluorous receptor-free ISE membranes. The fluorous sensors, usually consisting of the fluorous solvent perfluoro(perhydrophenanthrene) as the membrane matrix, demonstrated exceptional selectivities; the fluorous cation-exchanger demonstrated a selectivity range that was 8 orders of magnitude greater than an analogous non-fluorous sensor. Fluorous receptor-doped membranes were constructed using fluorophilic <b>trialkylamines</b> as H+ receptors. The selectivities of a fluorous sensor containing the receptor tris[(perfluorooctyl) pentyl]amine were among the highest ever reported for a pH ISE while the measuring range was 2. 5 orders of magnitude wider than for an analogous non-fluorous electrode. Using the fluorous ISE system developed in this work, binding constants were directly measured in fluorous solvents for the first time. The pKa of tris[(perfluoro- octyl) pentyl]amine in perfluoro(perhydrophenanthrene) was measured to be 15. 4 ± 0. 4, which is 2 - 3 units higher than would be expected for the same amine in a typical organic solvent of low polarity. In addition, the weak binding character of representative fluorous solvents (neat) containing heteroatoms was measured. The pKa of perfluorotripentylamine was measured to be < – 0. 5, while the 1 : 1 formal association constants for 2 H-perfluoro- 5, 8, 11 -trimethyl- 3, 6, 9, 12 -tetraoxapentadecane binding to Na+ and Li+ were measured to be 2. 3 and 1. 5 M– 1, respectively. In addition to demonstrating potentiometry in a fluorous solvent, a new fluorophilic electrolyte salt, tetrabutylammonium tetrakis[3, 5 -bis(perfluorohexyl) phenyl]- borate, was used to perform voltammetry in a fluorous solvent for the first time. Cyclic voltammograms of ferrocene were obtained from a 10 μm Pt microelectrode in an 80. 5 mM solution of a fluorophilic electrolyte salt in perfluoro(methylcyclohexane) ...|$|R
