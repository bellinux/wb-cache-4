5|$|Jersey {{is neither}} a Member State nor an Associate Member of the European Union. It does, however, have a {{relationship}} with the EU governed by article 335(5)(c) TFEU giving effect to Protocol 3 to the UK’s Treaty of Accession in 1972. However, Jersey does not appear on the list of European States and Territories outside the Union and the Communities prepared by the European Council and the Commission. This {{is a result of the}} manner of implementation of the Treaty arrangements under the Act of Accession in 1972. Jersey would have been fully within the European Communities like Gibraltar, being a European territory for whose external relations the United Kingdom was responsible, but <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> limited to the Protocol 3 arrangements under article 355 TFEU to reflect the then existing relationship with the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|While Homer {{longs for}} his wife, Moe comes by the Simpsons' house to declare his {{interest}} in Marge, who turns him down. When Homer comes into the house with flowers he picked for Marge, Moe sees him and jumps out the window. Standing before her in rags, Homer professes his total and utter dependency on Marge, and she tells him <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not a good thing, but Homer then makes his winning argument: he loves her, he needs her to love him, and {{can not afford to}} ever lose her trust again or he will end up dead. Marge is won over and allows Homer to return to the house. The family is glad that he has returned, although Moe is less than thrilled.|$|E

25|$|The {{writings}} often {{discuss the}} moon, but the calendar was {{not based on}} {{the movement of the}} moon any more than indications of the phases of the moon on a modern western calendar indicate <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a lunar calendar.|$|E
25|$|In {{theory of}} hearing physiology, the {{traveling}} wave (TW) of Von Bekesy, resulted from an acoustic surface {{wave of the}} basilar membrane into the cochlear duct. His theory pretended to explain every feature of the auditory sensation owing to these passive mechanical phenomena. Jozef Zwislocki, and later David Kemp, showed <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> unrealistic and that active feedback is necessary.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{structure}} of the university at the time, Thomas would have entered the Scots College there; the fact that the subscription was of Scottish officers indicates <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the most likely possibility. If true, it shows that Brus' motivations were not entirely altruistic. The Scots Colleges abroad were being used as training and staging areas for Scottish priests intended to enter Scotland {{in the wake of the}} invading army and play the most significant role in its reconversion. The failure of the invasion left them in place (without much work to do other than intelligence and conspiracy).|$|E

25|$|There was {{a report}} by KBS News in 2003 that a {{photograph}} allegedly of the Empress had been disclosed to the public. The photograph was supposedly purchased for a large sum by the grandfather of Min Soo-gyeong {{that was to be}} passed down as a family treasure. In the photo, the woman is accompanied by a retinue at her rear. Some experts have stated that the woman was clearly of high-rank and her clothing appears to be <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> worn only by the royal family. However, her outfit lacked the embroideries that decorates the apparel of the empress.|$|E
25|$|Another case is Uthman's other {{relative}} named Marwan bin Hakam, {{the one which}} instigate the controversy regarding nepotism {{was the case of}} the Marwan corruption of the spoils of war from the conquest of northern Africa. However, it is argued <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> non existent because the allegation of corruption was originated from the misconception regarding of how Marwan transported the spoils tribute to the capital. Marwan did not directly send the tribute of spoils of war because it was not efficient as the spoils of war was in the form of cattle and hardware. As such, he sold the spoils of war first and then the treasury in the form of Dinars, which easier to be transported was sent directly to the caliph.|$|E
25|$|Vallée also {{proposes that}} a {{secondary}} {{aspect of the}} UFO phenomenon involves human manipulation by humans. Witnesses of UFO phenomena undergo a manipulative and staged spectacle, meant to alter their belief system, and eventually, influence human society by suggesting alien intervention from outer space. The ultimate motivation for this deception is probably a projected major change of human society, the breaking down of old belief systems and the implementation of new ones. Vallée states that the evidence, if carefully analyzed, suggests an underlying plan for the deception of mankind by means of unknown, highly advanced methods. Vallée states that {{it is highly unlikely}} that governments actually conceal alien evidence, as the popular myth suggests. Rather, it is much more likely <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> exactly what the manipulators want us to believe. Vallée feels the entire subject of UFOs is mystified by charlatans and science fiction. He advocates a stronger and more serious involvement of science in the UFO research and debate. Only this can reveal the true nature of the UFO phenomenon.|$|E

25|$|The second {{modification}} was {{the requirement}} {{that one of the}} ice giants and Jupiter encounter Jupiter causing its semi-major axis to jump. In this jumping-Jupiter scenario an ice giant encounters Saturn and is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit, causing Saturn's orbit to expand; then encounters Jupiter and is scattered outward, causing Jupiter's orbit to shrink. This results in a step-wise separation of Jupiter's and Saturn's orbits instead of a smooth divergent migration. The step-wise separation of the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn avoids the slow sweeping of secular resonances across the inner solar System that resulted in the excitation of the eccentricities of the terrestrial planets and an asteroid belt with an excessive ratio of high- to low-inclination objects The encounters between the ice giant and Jupiter in this model allow Jupiter to acquire its own irregular satellites. Jupiter trojans are also captured following these encounters when Jupiter's semi-major axis jumps and, if the ice giant passes through one of the libration points scattering trojans, one population is depleted relative to the other. The faster traverse of the secular resonances across the asteroid belt limits the loss of asteroids from its core. Most of the rocky impactors of the Late Heavy Bombardment instead originate from an inner extension <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> disrupted when the giant planets reach their current positions, with a remnant remaining as the Hungaria asteroids. Some D-type asteroids are embedded in inner asteroid belt, within 2.5 AU, during encounters with the ice giant when it is crossing the asteroid belt.|$|E

500|$|Time bounds for integer sorting {{algorithms}} typically {{depend on}} three parameters: the number [...] of data values to be sorted, the magnitude [...] {{of the largest}} possible key to be sorted, and the number [...] of bits that can be represented in a single machine word of the computer on which the algorithm is to be performed. Typically, it is assumed <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> that machine words are large enough to represent an index into the sequence of input data, and also large enough to represent a single key.|$|E

500|$|In a 2011 {{appearance}} {{as host of}} Saturday Night Live while promoting his film The Muppets, Jason Segel mentioned The Land of Gorch in his opening monologue. In a follow-up interview, {{he was asked about}} the possibility of re-introducing The Land of Gorch to popular culture, and said, [...] "I think <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a reference that is probably lost to time...They weren't even famous then". In 2013, writer Jay Fosgitt marketed to publishing company Archaia Entertainment the idea of reviving The Land of Gorch characters in comic book format with a new storyline.|$|E
500|$|The fatwa {{also allowed}} Spain's Muslims to consume wine, pork, {{and other things}} {{normally}} forbidden by the sharia, {{as long as the}} Muslims did not intend to take advantage of them and rejected them in their hearts. The fatwa reaffirmed the permissibility of a Muslim man marrying a Christian woman, under the reasoning that both Muslims and Christians were People of the Book. Marriage between a Muslim woman and a Christian man was to be avoided unless under duress, and while doing so the Muslims should [...] "cleave firmly to the belief <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> forbidden".|$|E
500|$|In Germany, [...] "Schönen Tag noch!", the German {{phrase for}} [...] "have a nice day", {{is being used}} more {{frequently}} by its vendors and waiters. German author Hyde Flippo wrote that many Germans deem [...] "have a nice day" [...] to be affected and shallow. Flippo further opined that the phrase is an appropriate example of culturally improper language. He compared it to smiling arbitrarily at a German person which would {{give the impression that}} the smiler is a [...] "little simple-minded or not quite 'all there'". Writing that Germans prefer [...] "Auf Wiedersehen!" [...] or [...] "Tschüss!" [...] (both meaning [...] "goodbye")—which German shopkeepers frequently use—to [...] "dubious wishes for a nice day" [...] he opined <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> why Germans generally favor visiting a small shop instead of a large department store.|$|E
