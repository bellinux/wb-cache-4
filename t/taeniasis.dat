50|$|<b>Taeniasis</b> is a {{parasitic}} disease due to infection with tapeworms {{belonging to the}} genus Taenia. The two most important human pathogens in the genus are Taenia solium (the pork tapeworm) and Taenia saginata (the beef tapeworm). The third species Taenia asiatica is found only in East Asia. <b>Taeniasis</b> is generally asymptomatic, but severe infection causes weight loss, dizziness, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headaches, nausea, constipation, chronic indigestion, and loss of appetite.|$|E
5000|$|Cysticercosis is {{the most}} common {{preventable}} cause of epilepsy in the developing world. Cysticercosis occurs after ingestion of contaminated food, water, or soil. [...] Cysts and lesions can cause headaches, blindness, seizures, hydrocephalus, meningitis, and dementia. Neurocystocercosis, or the parasitic infection of the nervous system, can be fatal. <b>Taeniasis</b> is not fatal. [...] It is usually contracted after eating undercooked contaminated pork. <b>Taeniasis</b> has mild symptoms, including abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, or constipation.|$|E
50|$|In 1982, 18 gorals died {{in captivity}} in the Indian Zoo. Their deaths {{were caused by}} <b>taeniasis</b> {{parasitic}} disease, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, and hepatitis.|$|E
50|$|Asian <b>taeniasis</b> is {{documented}} in nine countries in Asia, including Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, south-central China, Vietnam, Japan and Nepal. The rate of a prevalence {{is estimated to}} be up to 21% and resulting in annual economic losses of about US$40,000,000 in these regions. Praziquantel is the drug of choice for treating the infection. As the latest addition to human <b>taeniasis,</b> misidentified for over two centuries, still complete lack of systematic diagnosis, and no control programmes, it is regarded as the most neglected human taenid.|$|E

50|$|A type of <b>taeniasis</b> called {{cysticercosis}} {{is caused}} by accidental infection with the eggs of T. solium from contaminated food and water. It {{is known as the}} most pathogenic form caused by tapeworms. A specific form of cysticercosis called neurocysticercosis {{is said to be the}} most common infection of the central nervous system.|$|E
50|$|Cysticercosis {{is usually}} {{acquired}} by eating food or drinking water contaminated by tapeworm eggs from human feces. Among foods, uncooked vegetables {{are the major}} source. The tapeworm eggs {{are present in the}} feces of a person infected with the adult worms, a condition known as <b>taeniasis.</b> <b>Taeniasis,</b> in the strict sense, is a different disease and is due to eating cysts in poorly cooked pork. People who live with someone with the pork tapeworm have a greater risk of getting cysticercosis. The diagnosis can be made by aspiration of a cyst. Taking pictures of the brain with computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are most useful for the diagnosis of disease in the brain. An increased number of a type of white blood cell, called eosinophils, in the cerebral spinal fluid and blood is also an indicator.|$|E

50|$|T. saginata has {{a strong}} {{resemblance}} to the other human tapeworms, such as Taenia asiatica and Taenia solium, in structure and biology, except for few details. It is typically larger and longer, with more proglottids, more testes, and higher branching of the uteri. It also lacks an armed scolex unlike other Taenia. Like the other tapeworms, it causes <b>taeniasis</b> inside the human intestine, but does not cause cysticercosis. Its infection is relatively harmless and clinically asymptomatic.|$|E
5000|$|In {{cases of}} human cysticercosis, {{diagnosis}} is a sensitive problem and requires biopsy of the infected tissue or sophisticated instruments. Taenia solium eggs and proglottids found in feces, ELISA, or {{polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis}} diagnose only <b>taeniasis</b> and not cysticercosis. Radiological tests, such as X-ray, CT scans which demonstrate [...] "ring-enhancing brain lesions", and MRIs, {{can also be used}} to detect diseases. X-rays are used to identify calcified larvae in the subcutaneous and muscle tissues, and CT scans and MRIs are used to find lesions in the brain.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Taeniasis</b> is {{predominantly}} found in Asia, Africa, Latin America, particularly on farms in which pigs {{are exposed to}} human excrement. It occurs everywhere though where beef and pork are eaten, even {{in countries such as}} the United States, with strict federal sanitation policies. Taenia saginata is relatively common in Africa, some parts of Eastern Europe, the Philippines, and Latin America. [...] It is most prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East. Taenia asiatica is retricted to East Asia, including Taiwan, Korea, Indonesia, Nepal, Thailand and China.|$|E
50|$|Infection can be {{effectively}} prevented by personal hygiene and sanitation: this includes cooking pork well, proper toilets and sanitary practices, and improved access to clean water. Treating those with <b>taeniasis</b> {{is important to}} prevent spread. Treating the disease when it does not involve the nervous system may not be required. Treatment of those with neurocysticercosis may be with the medications praziquantel or albendazole. These may be required {{for long periods of}} time. Steroids, for anti-inflammation during treatment, and anti-seizure medications may also be required. Surgery is sometimes done to remove the cysts.|$|E
50|$|To {{date the}} most {{relevant}} diagnosis of <b>taeniasis</b> due to T. asiatica is by enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot (EITB). EITB can effectively identify it from other taenid infections since serological test indicates that immunoblot band of 21.5 kDa exhibited specificity only to T. asiatica. Even though it gives 100% sensitivity, {{it has not been}} tested with human sera for cross-reactivity, and it may show a high false positive result. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is highly sensitive (~2.5 times that of multiplex PCR), without false positive, for differentiating the taenid species from faecal samples.|$|E
5000|$|Adult Taenia solium {{are easily}} treated with niclosamide, and is most {{commonly}} used in <b>taeniasis.</b> However cysticercosis is a complex disease and requires careful medication. Praziquantel (PZQ) is the drug of choice. In neurocysticercosis praziquantel is widely used. Albendazole {{appears to be more}} effective and a safe drug for neurocysticercosis. [...] In complicated situation a combination of praziquantel, albendazole and steroid (such as corticosteroids to reduces the inflammation) is recommended. In the brain the cysts can be usually found on the surface. Most cases of brain cysts are found by accident, during diagnosis for other ailments. Surgical removals are the only option of complete removal even if treated successfully with medications.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis of <b>taeniasis</b> {{is mainly}} using stool sample, {{particularly}} {{by identifying the}} eggs. However, this has limitation at the species level because tapeworms basically have similar eggs. Examination of the scolex or the gravid proglottids can resolve the exact species. But body segments are not often available, therefore, laborious histological observation of the uterine branches and PCR detection of ribosomal 5.8S gene are sometimes necessary. Ziehl-Neelsen stain is also used for T. saginata and T. solium, in most cases only the former will stain, but the method is not entirely reliable. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is highly sensitive (~2.5 times that of multiplex PCR), without false positives, for differentiating the taenid species from faecal samples.|$|E
5000|$|Taenia is a genus of {{tapeworms}} (a type of helminth) {{that includes}} some important parasites of livestock. Members {{of the genus}} are responsible for <b>taeniasis</b> and cysticercosis in humans, which are a type of helminthiasis belonging {{to the group of}} neglected tropical diseases. More than 100 species are recorded. They are morphologically characterized by a ribbon-like body composed of a series of segments called proglottids; hence the name Taenia (Greek ταίνια, tainia meaning ribbon, bandage, or stripe). The anterior end of the body is the scolex. Not all members of the genus Taenia have an armed scolex (hooks and/or spines located in the [...] "head" [...] region), for example, Taenia saginata has an unarmed scolex, while Taenia solium has an armed scolex.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the most}} common {{tapeworms}} in humans are the pork tapeworm (T. solium), the beef tapeworm (T. saginata), the fish tapeworm (Diphyllobothrium spp.), and the dwarf tapeworm (Hymenolepis spp.). Infections involving the pork and beef tapeworms are also called <b>taeniasis.</b> Tapeworms of the genus Echinococcus infect and cause the most harm to intermediate hosts such as sheep and cattle. Infection {{with this type of}} tapeworm is referred to as Echinococcosis or hydatid disease. Symptoms vary widely, as do treatment options, and these issues are discussed in detail in the individual articles on each worm. With a few notable exceptions like the fish tapeworm, most cestodes that infect humans and livestock are cyclophyllids, and can be identified as such by the presence of four suckers on their scolex or head.|$|E
50|$|Taenia saginata (synonym Taeniarhynchus saginata), {{commonly}} known as the beef tapeworm, is a zoonotic tapeworm belonging to the order Cyclophyllidea and genus Taenia. It is an intestinal parasite in humans causing <b>taeniasis</b> (a type of helminthiasis) and cysticercosis in cattle. Cattle are the intermediate hosts, where larval development occurs, while humans are definitive hosts harbouring the adult worms. It is found globally and most prevalently where cattle are raised and beef is consumed. It is relatively common in Africa, Europe, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Latin America. Humans are generally infected as a result of eating raw or undercooked beef which contains the infective larvae, called cysticerci. As hermaphrodites, each body segment called proglottid has complete sets of both male and female reproductive systems. Thus, reproduction is by self-fertilisation. From humans, embryonated eggs, called oncospheres, are released with faeces and are transmitted to cattle through contaminated fodder. Oncospheres develop inside muscle, liver, and lungs of cattle into infective cysticerci.|$|E
50|$|<b>Taeniasis</b> is {{contracted}} {{after eating}} undercooked or raw pork and beef that contain the larvae. Cysticercosis occurs after ingestion of contaminated food, water, or soil that contain T. solium eggs. Infection is acquired by eating undercooked beef and pork that contain the fluid-filled cysticerci of the tapeworms. The adult worms {{live in the}} lumen of the intestine where they cause the symptoms. They acquire nutrients from the intestine, leading to malnutrition of the host. The gravid proglottids, body segments containing fertilised eggs, are released in the faeces of the host. Then they are consumed by an intermediate host such as a cow or pig, where they hatch within the duodenum to become larvae, penetrate through the intestinal wall into nearby blood vessels, and enter the bloodstream. Once they reach organs such as the skeletal muscles, liver or lungs, the larvae then develop into a cyst, which then becomes a fluid-filled cysticercus. These contaminated tissues are then consumed through raw or undercooked meat.|$|E
50|$|Taenia asiatica, {{commonly}} known as Asian taenia or Asian tapeworm, is a parasitic tapeworm of humans and pigs. It {{is one of the}} three species of Taenia infecting humans and causes <b>taeniasis.</b> Discovered only in 1980s from Taiwan and other East Asian countries as an unusual species, it is so notoriously similar to Taenia saginata, the beef tapeworm, that it was for a time regarded as a slightly different strain. But anomaly arose as the tapeworm is not of cattle origin, but of pigs. Morphological details also showed significant variations, such as presence of rostellar hooks, shorter body, and less number of body segments. The scientific name designated was then Asian T. saginata. But the taxonomic consensus turns out to be that it is a unique species. It was in 1993 that two Korean parasitologists, Keeseon S. Eom and Han Jong Rim, provided the biological bases for classifying it into a separate species. The use of mitochondrial genome sequence and molecular phylogeny in the late 2000s established the taxonomic status.|$|E
50|$|In 1876 Grassi {{investigated}} {{his native}} hometown Rovellasca {{for the high}} mortality of cats and discovered that they were heavily infected with the nematode Dochmius balsami. In 1878, while still {{a student at the}} University of Pavia, he discovered anchylostomiasis in Italy from by identifying the eggs from the faeces of infected individuals. He continued to make great impacts on the study of Anguillula intestinalis, filarial worms, Trichocephalus dispar, and Bilharzia. He was the first to show that the human dwarf tapeworm Taenia nana is able to go through its entire life cycle in one animal, without the need of an intermediate host, a notion that had long been rejected. He was also the first to show that the flea Pulex serraticeps is the intermediate host of feline tapeworm Taenia elliptica. Thus he proposed that swallowing of infected fleas (for example, with milk) might be the reason for <b>taeniasis</b> in children. In 1879 he published a work on the life cycle of Strongyloides stercoralis, and erected the genus Strongyloides. In 1890 he, with Salvatore Calandruccio, described Dipetalonema reconditum, a non-pathogenic filarial worm of dogs, and showed that the parasite completed its development in human fleas, Pulex irritans.|$|E
50|$|Intestinal {{infection}} of T. solium is called <b>taeniasis</b> {{which is quite}} asymptomatic. Only in severe cases, conditions of intestinal irritation, anaemia, and indigestion occur, {{which can lead to}} loss of appetite and emaciation. Cysticercus is clinically pathogenic. Ingestion of T. solium eggs or proglottids which rupture within the host intestines can cause larvae to migrate into host tissue to cause cysticercosis. This is the most frequent and severe disease caused by T. solium. In symptomatic cases, a wide spectrum of symptoms may be expressed, including headaches, dizziness, and occasional seizures. In more severe cases, dementia or hypertension can occur due to perturbation of the normal circulation of cerebrospinal fluid. (Any increase in intracranial pressure will result in a corresponding increase in arterial blood pressure, as the body seeks to maintain circulation to the brain.) The severity of cysticercosis depends on location, size and number of parasite larvae in tissues, as well as the host immune response. Other symptoms include sensory deficits, involuntary movements, and brain system dysfunction. In children, ocular location of cysts is more common than cystation in other locations of the body.|$|E
50|$|T. solium {{is found}} worldwide, but {{is more common}} in {{cosmopolitan}} areas. Because pigs are intermediate hosts of the parasite, completion of the life cycle occurs in regions where humans live in close contact with pigs and eat undercooked pork. Therefore, high prevalences are reported in Mexico, Latin America, West Africa, Russia, India, Pakistan, Manchuria, and Southeast Asia. In Europe it is most widespread among Slavic countries. Cysticercosis is often seen in areas where poor hygiene allows for contamination of food, soil, or water supplies. Prevalence rates in the United States have shown immigrants from Mexico, Central and South America, and Southeast Asia account for most of the domestic cases of cysticercosis. <b>Taeniasis</b> and cysticercosis are very rare in predominantly Muslim countries, as Islam forbids the consumption of pork. Human cysticercosis is acquired by ingesting T. solium eggs shed in the feces of a human tapeworm carrier by gravid proglottids, so can occur in populations that neither eat pork nor share environments with pigs, although the completion of the life cycle can occur only where humans live in close contact with pigs and eat pork.|$|E
