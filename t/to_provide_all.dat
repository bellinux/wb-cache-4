5|$|Given {{the number}} of {{navigation}} algorithms calculating simultaneously <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>all</b> the information in real time, {{research has been conducted}} to improve the computation time of some numerical methods using field-programmable gate arrays. The research focused on visual perception. The first part was focused on the simultaneous localization and mapping with an extended Kalman filter that estimates the state of a dynamic system from a series of noisy or incomplete measures. The second focused on the location and the detection of obstacles.|$|E
5|$|In 1912 Neubronner {{completed}} his task (set in 1909) of photographing the waterworks at Tegel using only his mobile dovecote. Almost 10 years of negotiations {{were scheduled to}} end in August 1914 with a practical test at a maneuver in Strasbourg, followed by the state's acquisition of the invention. These plans were thwarted by {{the outbreak of the}} war. Neubronner had <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>all</b> his pigeons and equipment to the military, which tested them in the battlefield with satisfactory results, but did not employ the technique more widely.|$|E

5|$|Unicamp offers 70 {{different}} degree-granting undergraduate programs, covering {{nearly all}} {{different areas of}} science. Completing an undergraduate program grants either a bachelor's degree or a licentiate degree, although some programs offer both degrees. In line with the Brazilian educational system, no graduate education is required to practice any profession, including law and medicine, so undergraduate programs vary in length <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>all</b> the necessary training. Most programs at Unicamp last a total of 4 years, with engineering programs typically lasting 5 years and medicine lasting 6 years.|$|E
5|$|A cat's {{gastrointestinal}} tract {{is adapted to}} meat eating, being much shorter than that of omnivores and having low levels {{of several of the}} digestive enzymes needed to digest carbohydrates. These traits severely limit the cat's ability to digest and use plant-derived nutrients, as well as certain fatty acids. Despite the cat's meat-oriented physiology, several vegetarian or vegan cat foods have been marketed that are supplemented with chemically synthesized taurine and other nutrients, in attempts to produce a complete diet. However, some of these products still fail <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>all</b> the nutrients cats require, and diets containing no animal products pose the risk of causing severe nutritional deficiencies. However, veterinarians in the United States have expressed concern that many domestic cats are overfed.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, Reynolds and Reynolds won a {{contract}} <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>all</b> {{of the business}} forms for Chevrolet dealerships. The company opened new offices throughout the U.S. in the 1930s, and had 19 sales offices {{by the end of}} the decade. A controlling interest in the company was acquired in 1939 by Senior Richard Hallam Grant, ending the Reynolds family ownership. He became the company's president in 1941. A new printing facility was built in 1948 in Celina, Ohio, and another in 1953 in Dallas, Texas, in addition to the one built in Los Angeles in 1928. Reynolds became a public company in 1961. In the 1960s, Reynolds opened new printing facilities in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, New Jersey and Canada. In 1963, Reynolds expanded into Canada through the acquisition of the automotive business unit of Windsor Office Supply, forming Reynolds and Reynolds (Canada) Ltd. By the end of the decade it had about $50 million in revenues.|$|E

Franco concluded several agreements with the Italian government that {{would have seen the}} building of four Littorio-class battleships in Spain. The Italians promised <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>all</b> necessary technical and material support for the construction of the ships. The Italian Navy pushed to modernize and enlarge the existing shipyards in Spain, so that they could handle a vessel as large as the Littorio class. The project was abandoned after Italy became involved in World War II, {{and as a result of}} limited Spanish industrial capacity.|$|E

They asked him about his work with radiation and isotopes and asked Warren to become a civilian consultant for the MED. In March 1943, Warren met with Major Hymer L. Friedell at the MED's New York City headquarters. Friedell had joined the Metallurgical Laboratory in August 1942 from the University of California, Berkeley, where he had been involved in radiology research under Dr Robert S. Stone. Friedell requested information about safety matters involving radiation. Warren was unable <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>all</b> the information, but agreed to initiate research at Rochester.|$|E

New Brunswick's largest and smallest rural communities are Beaubassin East and Saint-André with populations of 6,376 and 772 respectively. Rural communities elect local councils and {{are responsible for the}} delivery of some local services, including administrative services, community planning and emergency measures. The province of New Brunswick ensures the delivery of other services including solid waste collection and recreation services unless the rural community chooses to take on these responsibilities.

5|$|In the 1920s, {{off-peak}} {{there was}} a train every 4–5minutes from Wembley Park to Baker Street. There were generally two services per hour from both Watford and Uxbridge that ran non-stop from Wembley Park and stopping services started from Rayners Lane, Wembley Park, and Neasden, although most did not stop at Marlborough Road and St John's Wood Road. Off-peak, stations north of Moor Park were generally served by Marylebone trains. During the peak trains approached Baker Street every 2.5–3minutes, half running through to Moorgate, Liverpool Street or Aldgate. On the inner circle a train from Hammersmith ran through Baker Street every 6minutes, and Kensington (Addison Road) services terminated at Edgware Road. Maintaining a frequency of ten trains {{an hour on the}} circle was proving difficult and the solution chosen was for the District to extend its Putney to Kensington High Street service around the circle to Edgware Road, using the new platforms, and the Met <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>all</b> the inner circle trains at a frequency of eight trains an hour.|$|E
