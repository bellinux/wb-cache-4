25|$|Often, {{since the}} {{population}} variance is an unknown parameter, {{it is estimated}} by the mean sum of squares; when this estimated value is used, {{the distribution of the}} sample mean is no longer a normal distribution but rather a Student's <b>t</b> <b>distribution</b> with n1 degrees of freedom.|$|E

40|$|The {{classical}} bivariate F distribution {{arises from}} ratios of chi-squared random variables with common denominators.

In this paper, we add a further independent chi-squared random variable to the denominator {{of one of the}} ratios and explore the extended bivariate F distribution, with marginals on arbitrary degrees of freedom, that results. Transformations linking F, beta and skew <b>t</b> <b>distributions</b> are then applied componentwise to produce bivariate beta and skew <b>t</b> <b>distributions</b> which also afford marginal (beta and skew <b>t)</b> <b>distributions</b> with arbitrary parameter values.

30|$|Prior to each {{relative}} permeability measurement, NMR <b>T</b> 2 <b>distribution</b> {{of the samples}} was measured at atmospheric condition with SPE-RE 1 - 050 NMR spectrometer (Beijing SPEC S&T Development Co. Ltd, China; Online Resource Fig. S 7). Thus, prior to water–oil {{relative permeability}} measurements, NMR <b>T</b> 2 <b>distributions</b> of all the core samples were measured, while they were fully saturated with deionized water. These NMR <b>T</b> 2 <b>distributions</b> were called “Before water–oil”. Prior to nanofluid–oil relative permeability, NMR <b>T</b> 2 <b>distributions</b> of all the core samples were measured, while they were fully saturated deionized water. These NMR <b>T</b> 2 <b>distributions</b> were called “Before nano-oil”. The “Before nano-oil” data were also used as the NMR <b>T</b> 2 <b>distributions</b> after water–oil relative permeability and called “After water–oil”. This is because this NMR <b>T</b> 2 <b>distribution</b> measurement precedes the nanofluid–oil relative permeability experiments, but follows that of water–oil relative permeability experiments. After nanofluid–oil relative permeability measurements, the core samples were cleaned, dried, and re-saturated with deionized water, and a final NMR <b>T</b> 2 <b>distribution</b> was measured. These were called “After nano-oil” NMR <b>T</b> 2 <b>distributions.</b> By comparing these NMR <b>T</b> 2 <b>distribution</b> curves, the effect of nanoparticle deposition in the core samples can be quantitatively evaluated. The magnetic field strength was 0.28  T, the resonance frequency of the hydrogen proton was 12  MHz, and the main NMR measurement parameters included an echo spacing of 0.3  ms, waiting time of 1000  ms, echo numbers of 1024, scanning numbers of 64, and an environmental temperature of 34.

The inversion results from the GCV, S-curve, and the slope of L-curve methods are satisfactory. The small or large α opt selected by the L-curve method leads to an oscillation or oversmoothed <b>T</b> 2 <b>distribution.</b> When the noise level is high, norm smoothing can more effectively than curvature smoothing avoid the bimodal <b>T</b> 2 <b>distribution</b> being converted to a single peak <b>distribution.</b> The inverted <b>T</b> 2 <b>distribution</b> of norm smoothing is better than that of curvature smoothing.|$|R
