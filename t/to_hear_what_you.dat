2500|$|In October 2015 his {{autobiography}} entitled Over the Top and Back: The Autobiography {{was published by}} Michael Joseph. Reviewing the book in the Daily Express, Clair Woodward said, [...] "In the tradition of so many autobiographies these days, Tom Jones's doesn't {{tell you what you}} really want <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b> ... <b>What</b> <b>you</b> are left with is a riotously enjoyable story of Jones 'The Voice' which nicely doubles as the story of British pop and light entertainment from the Sixties onwards." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speak is a first-person, diary-like narrative. Written in {{the voice}} of Melinda Sordino, it {{features}} lists, subheadings, spaces between paragraphs and script-like dialogue. The fragmented style mimics Melinda's trauma. The choppy sentences and blank spaces on the pages relate to Melinda's fascination with Cubism. According to Chris McGee and DeTora, Anderson's writing style allows the reader to see how Melinda struggles with [...] "producing the standard, cohesive narrative" [...] expected in a teen novel. Melinda's distracted narrative reiterates the idea that [...] "no one really wants <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have to say". In her article, [...] "Like Falling Up into a Storybook", Barbara Tannert-Smith says, By disrupting the present with flashbacks of the past, Anderson further illustrates the structure of trauma. Anderson organizes the plot around the four quarters of Melinda's freshman year, starting the story in the middle of Melinda's struggle. Anderson superimposed the fragmented trauma plot-line upon this linear high school narrative, making the narrative more believable.|$|E

This meeting {{also served as}} my first introduction to Animals As Leaders and Javier Reyes. Since then, Abasi, Reyes, and I have developed a great relationship. We got together almost every day to try out ideas, and after a month we had already formulated {{a majority of the}} record. At this point we contacted Eric Moore, an incredible drummer and the most joyful person to be around, and soon everything we had envisioned rhythmically came together on our first meeting/ recording session (at the Farias Productions Studios) on what is now T.R.A.M...I never know how people will respond to our music, I just never know! My goal is to try to instill a strong feeling or energy in people and I feel that collectively we achieved this goal tenfold with this new project. We all have a great enthusiasm and desire to perform this material live and see this band further develop. We look forward <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> all think of it.” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It's {{not worth}} while. I've no {{objections}} <b>to</b> Miss Leigh's <b>hearing</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>to</b> say, and I'm afraid Volador wouldn't stand unless I kept the reins.

50|$|Besides Colby’s {{interesting}} thematic projects, Fruitlands bears smaller {{traces of}} her fingerprints: her {{obsession with the}} color blue, the quote she uses from {{one of my favorite}} Built to Spill songs (No one wants <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> / <b>what</b> <b>you</b> dreamt about / unless you dreamt about / them), her references to Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruno Schulz. These moments are so delightful and unique, they feel comfortably inscrutable. Or, just as likely, I realized there was something harsh, even disingenuous, in asking the question “why?” when they felt just right.|$|R
