5|$|On the Sunday, Jenkyns was {{involved}} in an incident after he and an acquaintance staked a quart of beer on a bicycle race. Solihull Police Court later heard how, after Jenkyns lost the race, he knocked his opponent off his bicycle, hit another man, {{and returned to the}} public house where he struck a third man in the face. He was convicted on three counts of assault, and fined 20s plus costs on each count. In the following day's visit to Everton, Small Heath had Oliver and Charles Partridge to <b>thank</b> <b>for</b> the score being restricted to 5–0.|$|E
5|$|Qualification for the 1990 World Cup {{required}} Charlton to mastermind a top two {{finish in}} a group consisting of Spain, Hungary, Northern Ireland and Malta. The campaign started on hostile ground at Belfast's Windsor Park, and he had stand-in goalkeeper Gerry Peyton to <b>thank</b> <b>for</b> the point gained from a goalless draw with Northern Ireland. A series of injuries left only a skeleton squad to face Spain at the Estadio Benito Villamarín, leaving a recall for defender David O'Leary, and Ireland were well beaten 2–0. They then left Budapest's Népstadion with a point from another goalless draw, though they were criticised for not taking all three points after dominating the game. The next four fixtures would be played at Lansdowne Road, and all four games ended in victory. First they beat Spain 1–0 after an own goal from Míchel, then they overcame Malta and Hungary with 2–0 wins, before beating Northern Ireland 3–0. Qualification for Ireland's first World Cup was assured at the Ta' Qali National Stadium after John Aldridge scored both goals in another 2–0 victory.|$|E
25|$|In a {{resurgence}} {{that has been}} linked by some to freedom from Apartheid guilt, Afrikaans music saw a surge in new artists, album releases and sales after 2000. In 2004 an Afrikaans album (by balladeer Steve Hofmeyr) was named best-selling album of the year. The massive purchasing power of the Afrikaner minority is partly to <b>thank</b> <b>for</b> this.|$|E

25|$|Sussex Sharks had England wicket-keeper Matt Prior {{and former}} Zimbabwe batsman Murray Goodwin to <b>thank</b> <b>for</b> their {{imposing}} {{win over the}} Bears. Prior scored 144 - a career best score - and Goodwin 79 to lift Sussex to a massive 283 for 7, Zimbabwe all-rounder Heath Streak the only bowler with reasonably respectable figures of three for 39 off 9 overs. The reply was shortened by rain, setting Warwickshire 198 to win off 30 overs, but after 48 from Neil Carter there was little left in the Warwickshire reply as they finished on 153 for 7.|$|E
25|$|Australia A {{dominated}} the first day, mostly thanks to 146 from James Hopes, {{who had come}} in {{as a replacement for}} Phil Jaques. The Pakistani bowling attack who had been so effective a week earlier had been replaced, with only Mansoor Amjad retained from the previous game, and the Pakistan A team had seven new faces. They now conceded 19 no balls in a day, as Australia A racked up 318 runs for the loss of five wickets, and Hopes scored 146. The second day was rained off, but the tourists added 89 in 17 overs on the third day, as Shane Watson got a half-century. Pakistan A, batting second, had Hasan Raza to <b>thank</b> <b>for</b> even getting near a competitive score - the 23-year-old batsman added 111 not out from number five, defying off spinner Dan Cullen to help Pakistan A to 249 for 6 at the close of play on day three.|$|E
25|$|Lastly, England {{played the}} West Indies, {{in what was}} Brian Lara's last {{international}} match. He was absurdly run out for 18, but the hosts still went on to compile 300 with Chris Gayle, Devon Smith and Marlon Samuels all hitting half centuries. Nixon took one catch – Ramnaresh Sarwan off the bowling of Liam Plunkett. In reply, England had Michael Vaughan to <b>thank</b> <b>for</b> a fairly solid start, reaching 101 before losing a second wicket. However, a mid order collapse followed, as Paul Collingwood, Andrew Flintoff and Jamie Dalrymple all fell in quick succession. Nixon came to the crease with his side 189–6 and 112 runs still needed for victory. By picking the gaps and careful play, Nixon kept his score ticking along, whilst keeping his wicket intact. At the other end, Kevin Pietersen went on to record his second century of the competition, before being bowled by Jerome Taylor. The two had put on 80 together – a crucial partnership in the circumstances, but 31 runs were still required. Liam Plunkett came and went, and with three more runs needed, Nixon himself was bowled by Dwayne Bravo. His 38 (off 39 deliveries, with four 4s) was a vital contribution which helped bring England to the cusp of victory. Playing in his first match of the competition, Stuart Broad hit the winning runs to secure a morale boosting win for his side.|$|E

500|$|Joe Fountain {{made his}} debut against Sunderland as a late {{replacement}} for Wheldon, whose sister had {{died on the}} morning of the match. On a slippery pitch [...] "thickly strewn with chaff and hayseeds", Small Heath fell a goal behind in a first half dominated by the defences of both teams. The special training undertaken by the home side in preparation for the match took effect, as [...] "in the closing stages they looked winners all over", and Sunderland had goalkeeper Ned Doig to <b>thank</b> <b>for</b> restricting the scoring to just Tommy Hands' equaliser. The attendance of 15,000 was nearly double the highest recorded in previous seasons.|$|E
500|$|Dogmeat was {{inspired}} by the unnamed dog of Max Rockatansky (Mad Max) from the 1981 post-apocalyptic film Mad Max 2. His initial name had been [...] "Dogshit" [...] and his ultimate name was derived from the opening scene of the 1975 post-apocalyptic film A Boy and His Dog, in which the main character Vic calls his dog Blood [...] "dog meat". According to Fallout producer, lead programmer and designer Tim Cain, [...] "Leonard Boyarsky, the [...] art director ... had that movie running continuously in his office, and I think he remarked on several occasions that having a dog in the game would be really cool. [...] why we wanted a dog in the first place." [...] Fallout programmer and designer Jesse Heinig was credited by Cain as probably [...] "one person to <b>thank</b> <b>for</b> Dogmeat." [...] Heinig himself said: [...] "My understanding is that [...] Scott Bennie settled on the name 'Dogmeat' for the character, and it's likely that he did pick that from the story in question." ...|$|E
500|$|Celtic {{made their}} {{debut in the}} group stages of the Champions League on 18 September 2001, losing 2–3 to Juventus in Turin. Celtic had {{recovered}} from a 2–0 deficit to level the match at 2–2, but lost a third goal near the end from a controversial penalty. Celtic recovered from that set-back to win their next two home matches against Porto and Rosenborg, but lost the away matches against the same opposition. [...] Celtic's final group match was against Juventus at Parkhead on 31 October 2001. A Chris Sutton brace and an outstanding performance from Ľubomír Moravčík helped Celtic to a famous 4–3 win. Despite finishing the group with nine points, however, Celtic failed {{to qualify for the}} next round and were demoted to the UEFA Cup. They were drawn against Valencia, where in the first leg in Spain, the club had goalkeeper Rab Douglas to <b>thank</b> <b>for</b> keeping the score to a manageable 0–1 defeat. The second leg in Glasgow saw Henrik Larsson scoring to give Celtic a 1–0 win after 90 minutes to level the tie on aggregate. As no goals were scored during extra-time, the tie went to penalty-kicks, where Celtic lost, suffering elimination.|$|E

500|$|In {{the case}} of Weber's {{critique}} of the left, he complained that {{the leaders of the}} leftist Spartacus League which was led by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg and controlled the city government of Berlin while Weber was campaigning for his party: [...] "We have this [...] revolution to <b>thank</b> <b>for</b> the fact that we cannot send a single division against the Poles. All we see is dirt, muck, dung, and horse-play—nothing else. Liebknecht belongs in the madhouse and Rosa Luxemburg in the zoological gardens.” [...] Weber was at the same time critical of the Versailles Treaty which he believed unjustly assigned [...] "war guilt" [...] to Germany when it came to World War I. [...] Weber believed that many countries were guilty of starting World War I, not just Germany. [...] In making this case, Weber argued that “In {{the case of}} this war there is one, and only one power that desired it under all circumstances through its own will and, according to their political goals required: Russia. [...] …It never crossed [...] mind that a German invasion of Belgium [...] was nothing but an innocent act {{on the part of the}} Germans." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Rockstar 101" [...] {{received}} mixed {{responses from}} music critics. Brian Linder for IGN praised the song, writing that it [...] "actually works" [...] despite sounding disjointed at first. Emily Tartanella of PopMatters defined [...] "Rockstar 101" [...] as a [...] "brilliant bit of bravado" [...] during her review of Rated R, while Ailbhe Malone for NME wrote that Rihanna sings with [...] "swagger" [...] on the track, which {{was something that}} she has Hova to <b>thank</b> <b>for.</b> Jon Pareles for The New York Times simply highlighted {{a line from the}} song, [...] "I never play the victim". Neil McCormick for The Daily Telegraph thought that [...] "Rockstar 101" [...] {{was one of the few}} songs on the album to retain the [...] "vaguest leftover hints of her warm Caribbean vocal flavouring". Ann Powers for the Los Angeles Times was critical of Slash's inclusion on the song, and she described it as an [...] "afterthought". Powers wrote [...] "she can definitely get by without that ultimate rock phallic symbol", a reference to Slash. Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombell felt that [...] "Rockstar 101, alike [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] and [...] "The Last Song", were [...] "instantly-dated missteps from a bygone era when a Slash feature was cool". He further wrote that [...] "Rockstar 101" [...] and [...] "G4L" [...] were [...] "harder to justify considering their mindless boasts and torpid production". The song was met with a negative review from The Guardians Alex Petridis, who wrote [...] "At one extreme, the resemblance of 'Umbrella's chorus to that of a stadium rock ballad seems to have encouraged Rihanna to cut out the middle-man and just start making stadium rock: cue the awful widdly-woo guitars of 'Rockstar 101' and 'Fire Bomb.|$|E

2500|$|Adelaide {{continued}} to dominate proceedings {{in the second}} half and Mabil wasted another chance just after the break, blazing over the bar once again after some neat build up play from Cirio.

Carrusca slipped Cirio through {{from the edge of the}} area, and the player rounded Vukovic and slotted his shot from a tight angle. Perth had Vukovic to <b>thank</b> <b>for</b> keeping the score at 1–0 when he tipped over a 30-metre shot from Isaías with five minutes remaining. Late into the match, Adelaide [...] were content to maintain possession and saw out the final few minutes without any incident, ensuring they held on for the win.|$|E
