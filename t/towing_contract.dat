50|$|With {{the fledgling}} museum’s lack of income, List-Brain and Stevens decided that one {{solution}} was to put the Cervia back {{to work in the}} towing business. At this time exploration in the North sea for gas and oil was begging to pick up in pace. This provided an ideal opportunity for the Cervia to earn her keep again. The Cervia was contracted to a construction firm based on the Medway. The construction firm ofHoward Doris needed all manner of craft to assist with oil rig construction projects. In November 1974 Cervia to towed a crane barge to the Humber. She completed the contract with no problems, but with the cost of a very rapid re-equipping and complete lack of understanding as to the economics of marine towage meant the nett profit from this first <b>towing</b> <b>contract</b> was only £7.00.|$|E
50|$|During a 1963 {{investigation}} by the Boston City Council into the city's <b>towing</b> <b>contracts,</b> {{it was revealed that}} McNamara had listed his voting address as an apartment that was rented to Nathan Baker, a bail bondsman who formed a garage after McNamara took office which received most of the police department's towing business. After this came to light, McNamara ordered that all police towing cease. The Council did not find McNamara guilty of any wrongdoing.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{contract}} with Howard Doris and the small profit, List-Brain and Stevens decided to put the fledgling business on a more professional business footing. A professional crew was employed and throughout 1975 several more successful <b>towing</b> <b>contracts</b> were undertaken by the Cervia all around {{the coast of the}} United Kingdom. During this time Cervia continued to prove her reliability working solidly for this twelve-month period except for a small period of time spent on essential boiler cleaning and maintenance. So successful was the business and the increasing demands placed on it, a proper company was set up which was called International Towing Ltd. ITL, as the company was abbreviated to, added three more steam tugs to her books to keep up with demand. These’s tugs were ST Hercules, ST Hero and ST Goliath.|$|R
5000|$|Lincoln uses {{state of}} the art {{technology}} including satellite tracking to provide towing services for landlords with tenant parking problems and for commercial property owners with similar problems. The primary business is removing unauthorized vehicles from parking spaces. [...] The business claims the largest fleet of wheel-lift and flatbed towing vehicles in Chicago. [...] The business model is such that towing companies engage in exclusive <b>towing</b> <b>contracts</b> for properties and collect fees from owners of unauthorized vehicles that have been towed. However, the company also provides vehicle repossession services and parking lot management services which include snow removal, pot hole patching, striping, and complete parking lot construction. [...] As a private company enforcing private property parking, the company does not issue parking tickets in addition to charging for towing and storage, unlike the City of Chicago, which does for parking in tow zones. It has towed over 30,000 unauthorized parked cars since September 5, 2005, which makes it Chicago's leading relocator.|$|R
50|$|As of 29 December 2016, Farley Mowat hulk {{remained}} docked in Shelburne, {{with over}} C$130,000 in docking fees owing. In June 2017, the Canadian Coast Guard informed Shelburne city staff that the vessel would be removed {{in the following}} weeks to be broken up. On 26 July 2017, the hulk was towed away by Atlantic <b>Towing</b> under <b>contract</b> from the Canadian Coast Guard to be broken up at Liverpool, Nova Scotia.|$|R
40|$|Don Carter {{grew up in}} {{a family}} that has worked on the Fraser River since 1900. His {{grandfather}} was a well-known boat builder and a fisherman, and his father had <b>towing</b> <b>contracts</b> with multiple mills along the waterfront. He started working at age 14, along with his three brothers, feeding lumber into a saw that the mills had in the water or helping out with the booms. At the same time, his grandfather gave him his first boat, and Carter would row on the river daily. On the river, he collected dunnage (the packing material used to separate cargo in a ship’s hold) that he used to build his first fishing shed. Companies mentioned in the interview are Capilano Lumber, Fraser Mills, Lamford Cedar, King Neptune Restaurant, Valley Towing, Swiftsure Towing, and the Shell and Chevron waterfront gas stations. During the interview Carter is showing photographs to the interviewer and describing them. The interview was conducted as part of History 461 – Oral History Practicum at Simon Fraser Universit...|$|R
5000|$|From the {{standpoint}} of the consumer, AAA clubs primarily provide emergency road services to members. These services, which include towing, lockouts, winching, tire changes, automotive first aid, battery replacement, and others, are handled by private local <b>towing</b> companies <b>contracted</b> by a state AAA club. AAA sells roadside assistance for a variety of motor vehicles, including motorcycles. In some areas, AAA also offers bicycle roadside assistance. Many AAA clubs have an automotive fleet division serving large metro areas, while private towing companies cover the surplus call volume by area. Recently, certain clubs have implemented an [...] "on the go" [...] diagnostic/installation automotive battery program.|$|R

TMS also make contracts with credit card banks and when their clients confront car emergency, then banks would contact TMS, and the roadside assistance would be provided by TMS’ <b>contracted</b> <b>towing</b> company which is the nearest to the clients’ location of car emergency (KH’s representative, in interview)” [...]...|$|R
50|$|Many tow {{companies}} can store vehicles {{that have been}} wrecked or impounded by police agencies. In these circumstances, police agencies notify a <b>contracted</b> <b>towing</b> provider to secure the vehicle and tow it to a storage lot. The tow company will sometimes prevent access to the vehicle until the law states the owner can claim it (usually after any fines are paid). Some local governments operate their own towing and impound lots, and don't need a contracted provider.|$|R
50|$|The {{impounding}} agent may {{travel in}} a tow truck, in which case, {{he may be}} able to conduct the tow directly with no additional input. Often, the agent may not have the authority to do so, and may have to call in a specific resource (badged agent, marshall, etc.) to oversee the operation. If the locating agent and/or authorized agent do not have a tow vehicle, they will have to call one in, either from the agency's own fleet, or for a <b>contracted</b> <b>towing</b> company.|$|R
25|$|The {{slump in}} the {{shipbuilding}} industry {{finally came to}} an end in 1880, when new ship orders, generated by demand for foreign produce such as sugar, wool and coffee, began to arrive. Neafie & Levy contracted for freighters and tugs, in particular for the wooden steamships Maracaibo and Fortuano for the Red D Line's Venezuelan coffee imports. Reconstruction of the American South following the Civil War was also creating new demand, and in the same year Neafie & Levy also contracted for the Clyde steamer Delaware for the southern cotton trade. Further contracts came in the 1880s with the patronage of Philadelphia's Lewis Luckenbach Towing Company, which needed barges and powerful tugboats for its novel transport method of tandem barge <b>towing,</b> and which <b>contracted</b> with Neafie & Levy for such vessels as the 200-ton tugboat Ocean King, built in 1884.|$|R
50|$|The {{general rule}} in English law {{is that if}} one party to the {{contract}} is mistaken about {{the terms of the}} contract, this is not an excuse to fail to perform, the classic case being Smith v Hughes. There has been debate about whether at any point courts do in fact have regard to the subjective intentions of the parties. In Scriven Bros & Co v Hindley & Co Scriven Bros made a bid at an auction (the auctioneer was trading as Hindley & Co) for bales of hemp and tow. The auction catalogue suggested that one of the batches contained both hemp and tow. But it only contained tow. When the auctioneer tried to enforce the high bid by Scriven Bros, Lawrence J held he could not, because the sale had been procured by the auctioneer's own negligence. Guenter Treitel has argued that the case is best explained on the basis that the court will have regard to the subjective intentions of the parties - that in fact hemp and <b>tow</b> was being <b>contracted</b> for. But Ewan McKendrick argues that this case is still explicable through taking an objective approach to the parties expressed wishes: a reasonable person in Hindley's position would not have thought there was a contract with someone misled by their negligently prepared auction catalogue.|$|R
