METHODS: A software phantom was constructed using the data available on the BrainWeb database by assigning activity values to grey and white matter. The <b>true</b> <b>attenuation</b> map was generated by assigning attenuation coefficients to six different tissue classes to create a non-uniform attenuation map. The uniform attenuation map was calculated using an attenuation coefficient of 0. 15 cm(- 1). Hypoperfused lesions of varying intensities and sizes were added. The phantom was then projected as typical SPECT projection data, taking into account attenuation and collimator blurring {{with the addition of}} Poisson noise. The projection data were reconstructed using four different methods: filtered back-projection in combination with Chang's first-order attenuation correction using the uniform or the <b>true</b> <b>attenuation</b> map and maximum likelihood iterative reconstruction using the uniform or the <b>true</b> <b>attenuation</b> map. Different Gaussian post-smoothing kernels were applied onto the reconstructed images and the performance of each procedure was analysed using figures of merit such as signal-to-noise ratio, bias and variance. RESULTS: Uniform attenuation correction offered only slight deterioration of the signal-to-noise ratio compared to the <b>true</b> <b>attenuation</b> map. Maximum likelihood produced superior signal-to-noise ratios and lower bias at the same variance in comparison to the filtered back-projection. CONCLUSION: Uniform attenuation correction is adequate for lesion detection while maximum likelihood provides enhanced lesion detection when compared to filtered back-projection. status: publishe...|$|E

Additionally, there is a higher imaging flexibility based on the availability of three imaging modalities, which can be combined for the characterization of the disease. The downside is a somewhat higher radiation dose of up to 3  mSv with a low dose CT based on the CT-component, longer acquisition times and potential misalignment between the imaging components.

40|$|Abstract. This work {{deals with}} the single photon {{emission}} computed tomography (SPECT) reconstruction process. As a SPECT measurement also depends on unknown attenuation properties of the tissue, such a process is challenging. Furthermore, the given attenuation {{may not be a}} good approximation to the <b>true</b> <b>attenuation</b> field. Reasons are repositioning or movement of the patient such as relaxation during scan time or even breathing. We propose a novel model for an attenuation correction in SPECT reconstruction, which is a natural extension of an idea of Natterer in that way, as the linear transformation of a so-called attenuation prototype is enhanced to an arbitrary transformation. We present numerical results for a non-linear spline transformation model which clearly indicate the superiority of the proposed reconstruction model compared to the case of no motion correction and the correction with a linear transformation model. ...|$|E

Because {{the purpose of this study}} is to assess the performance of MR-based motion correction on PET parametric imaging, the attenuation map in the reference motion phase was directly derived from the XCAT phantom. In a real PET-MR study, however, the currently implemented method for PET attenuation correction is to segment tissues into a few different types based on MR images using Dixon sequence and then assign a single attenuation coefficient to each tissue type [39].|$|E

Current methodologies for estimating attenuation from seismic data (spectral ratio, centroid frequencies and instantaneous frequencies) have been applied to the specific geometries associated with prestack surface seismic data and vertical seismic profiles, and adapted where possible for direct comparison of waveforms from two vintages of data.

30|$|Five {{years after}} the {{introduction}} of the first whole-body PET/MR systems, attenuation correction of PET images remains challenging. This is particularly <b>true</b> for bone <b>attenuation,</b> due to the inability of 1 H-MRI to detect the crystal component of cortical bone. Neglecting bone attenuation leads to significant activity underestimation in bone as well as in neighboring tissues [1, 2], which is of particular concern for the brain given the skull density. Original approaches have been developed to assess skull attenuation by MRI, such as atlas-based, template-based, and segmentation-based methods [3]. However, these approaches provide an indirect assessment of bone density and remain inaccurate in the vicinity of bones [4, 5]. In this context, the ability to measure the density of cortical bone crystal in vivo by MRI would be of great interest. This study presents a new MR-based method for bone attenuation correction, based on 31 P-MRI of hydroxyapatite crystals. The method was implemented on preclinical MRI and PET/CT systems in order to provide in vivo proof of concept in rodent. A calibration experiment was first conducted on a bone sample to determine the conversion factor from 31 P signal intensity to linear attenuation coefficient μ. Then in vivo MRI and PET/CT were performed on a rat. A μ-map of the skull was calculated from 31 P-MRI and used to correct 18 F-FDG PET images of the brain for skull attenuation.|$|R

40|$|The {{exciting}} {{prospect of}} Spectral CT (SCT) using photon-counting detectors (PCD) {{will lead to}} new techniques in computed tomography (CT) that {{take advantage of the}} additional spectral information provided. We introduce a method to reduce metal artifact in X-ray tomography by incorporating knowledge obtained from SCT into a statistical iterative reconstruction scheme. We call our method Spectral-driven Iterative Reconstruction (SPIR). The proposed algorithm consists of two main components: material decomposition and penalized maximum likelihood iterative reconstruction. In this study, the spectral data acquisitions with an energy-resolving PCD were simulated using a Monte-Carlo simulator based on EGSnrc C++ class library. A jaw phantom with a dental implant made of gold was used as an object in this study. A total of three dental implant shapes were simulated separately to test the influence of prior knowledge on the overall performance of the algorithm. The generated projection data was first decomposed into three basis functions: photoelectric absorption, Compton scattering and attenuation of gold. A pseudo-monochromatic sinogram was calculated and used as input in the reconstruction, while the spatial information of the gold implant was used as a prior. The results from the algorithm were assessed and benchmarked with state-of-the-art reconstruction methods. Decomposition results illustrate that gold implant of any shape can be distinguished from other components of the phantom. Additionally, the result from the penalized maximum likelihood iterative reconstruction shows that artifacts are significantly reduced in SPIR reconstructed slices in comparison to other known techniques, {{while at the same time}} details around the implant are preserved. Quantitatively, the SPIR algorithm best reflects the <b>true</b> <b>attenuation</b> value in comparison to other algorithms.

40|$|The {{rain rate}} data and {{statistics}} of a location {{are often used}} in conjunction with models to predict rain attenuation. However, the <b>true</b> <b>attenuation</b> is a function not only of rain rate, but also of the drop size distribution (DSD). Generally, models utilize an average drop size distribution (Laws and Parsons or Marshall and Palmer [1]). However, individual rain events may deviate from these models significantly if their DSD is not well approximated by the average. Therefore, characterizing the relationship between the DSD and attenuation is valuable in improving modeled predictions of rain attenuation statistics. The DSD may also be used to derive the instantaneous frequency scaling factor and thus validate frequency scaling models Since June of 2014, NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) and the Politecnico di Milano (POLIMI) have jointly conducted a propagation study in Milan, Italy utilizing the 20 and 40 GHz beacon signals of the Alphasat TDP# 5 Aldo Paraboni payload. The Ka- and Q-band beacon receivers provide a direct measurement of the signal attenuation while concurrent weather instrumentation provides measurements of the atmospheric conditions at the receiver. Among these instruments is a Thies Clima Laser Precipitation Monitor (optical disdrometer) which yields droplet size distributions (DSD); this DSD information can be used to derive a scaling factor that scales the measured 20 GHz data to expected 40 GHz attenuation. Given the capability to both predict and directly observe 40 GHz attenuation, this site is uniquely situated to assess and characterize such predictions. Previous work using this data has examined the relationship between the measured drop-size distribution and the measured attenuation of the link [2]. The focus of this paper now turns to a deeper analysis of the scaling factor, including the prediction error as a function of attenuation level, correlation between the scaling factor and the rain rate, and the temporal variability of the drop size distribution both within a given rain event and across different varieties of rain events...|$|E
40|$|Small-strain {{stiffness}} and damping ratio {{are the key}} parameters to evaluate dynamic behaviour of soils {{even if they are}} often problematic and onerous to obtain. This is particularly <b>true</b> for the <b>attenuation</b> characteristics. Common predictive seismic response analysis needs the input parameters as a selection of accelerograms and realistic subsoil models. The models need to be populated by physical properties such as the layers structure, seismic waves propagation velocities, materials densities as well as a their capability of dissipating energy. This last parameter takes the various forms of an attenuation coefficient a [dB/m], a quality factor Q [dimensionless] or Damping ratio D [dimensionless]. The damping ratio defined in this manner is, in general, frequency dependent. However at small strain level the material damping ratio {{is considered to be a}} constant and therefore frequency independent. Laboratory measurements of the damping ratio are very well established, even if they suffer from the effect of specimen disturbance on the measurements results. On site soil parameter characterization is getting more and more common, particularly on the basis of surface wave dispersion. Many recent works claim that in situ measurements shall be used also to gain a solid understanding of attenuation characteristics in soil deposits. Despite these progresses, only limited applications of these techniques is observed. The scarce interest towards the identification of damping characteristics is partly caused by a lack of understanding of the importance of damping. In this work we preliminary try to identify the cases where an accurate identification of the damping characteristics is needed, as opposed to cases where literature values can be used with no major detriment of the prediction accuracy. Our investigation is based on 1 D linear-equivalent Shake predictions based on synthetic soil stiffness profiles and a real input seismogram.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of scatter and its correction on kinetic parameters in dynamic brain positron emission tomography (PET) tumor imaging. The 2 -tissue compartment model was used, and two different reconstruction methods and two scatter correction (SC) schemes were investigated. Methods: The gate Monte Carlo (MC) softwarewas used to perform 2 × 15 full PET scan simulations of a voxelized head phantom with inserted tumor regions. The two sets of kinetic parameters of all tissues were chosen to represent the 2 -tissue compartment model for the tracer 3 ′-deoxy- 3 ′-(18 F) fluorothymidine (FLT), and were denoted FLT 1 and FLT 2. PET data were reconstructed with both 3 D filtered back-projection with reprojection (3 DRP) and 3 D ordered-subset expectation maximization (OSEM). Images including <b>true</b> coincidences with <b>attenuation</b> correction (AC) and true+scattered coincidences with AC and with and without one of two applied SC schemes were reconstructed. Kinetic parameters were estimated by weighted nonlinear least squares fitting of image derived time–activity curves. Calculated parameters were compared to the true input to the MC simulations. Results: The relative parameter biases for scatter-eliminated data were 15 %, 16 %, 4 %, 30 %, 9 %, and 7 % (FLT 1) and 13 %, 6 %, 1 %, 46 %, 12 %, and 8 % (FLT 2) for K 1, k 2, k 3, k 4,Va, and Ki, respectively. As expected, SC was essential for most parameters since omitting it increased biases by 10 percentage points on average. SC was not found necessary for the estimation of Ki and k 3, however. There was no significant difference in parameter biases between the two investigated SC schemes or from parameter biases from scatter-eliminated PET data. Furthermore, neither 3 DRP nor OSEM yielded the smallest parameter biases consistently although therewas a slight favor for 3 DRP which produced less biased k 3 and Ki estimates while OSEM resulted in a less biased Va. The uncertainty in OSEM parameterswas about 26 % (FLT 1) and 12 % (FLT 2) larger than for 3 DRP although identical postfilters were applied. Conclusions: SC was important for good parameter estimations. Both investigated SC schemes performed equally well on average and properly corrected for the scattered radiation, without introducing further bias. Furthermore, 3 DRP was slightly favorable over OSEM in terms of kinetic parameter biases and SDs...|$|R
