5|$|Against these setbacks, the CTR {{still had}} a record year in 1928, with over 30 million journeys. But from 1929, the buses took to the narrow streets in the city centre, as well as routes with low tram traffic such as Chartreux, Maromme and the circular. The tramways {{continued}} as going concerns, and started large programmes of renovation and modernisation in <b>the</b> <b>dozen</b> or so years before World War II. Between 1928 and 1932, 75 first-generation trams were rebuilt to allow one man operation.|$|E
5|$|Excavations at {{the site}} in the 1970s were {{sponsored}} by the University of California, Berkeley. They began in 1976 and were undertaken by John A. Graham, Robert F. Heizer and Edwin M.

Excavations by the University of California at Berkeley continued until 1981 and uncovered even more monuments in that time.

5|$|German glass {{ornaments}} {{were introduced}} to America by Frank Woolworth in the 1880s but such ornaments were produced under labor-intensive conditions and were expensive, with few Americans being able to afford {{more than one or}} two ornaments per year. On the eve of World War II, however, American companies began manufacturing inexpensive, mass-produced ornaments that made it possible for almost any American to have an extensive collection of Christmas ornaments for little cost within moments. With a few modifications, Corning Glass's light bulb machine could spit out 2,000 blank glass ornaments a minute that were then bought by ornament companies to be decorated, packaged and sold by <b>the</b> <b>dozen.</b>|$|E

A fan-made, full-color, 200-page, professional-quality player's guide was released alongside the translation. The Verge cited the effort as proof of the fan base's dedication.|$|E
5|$|In {{the past}} {{part of the}} {{population}} worked in coal mining, although there are no working mines in the area now. There is still a fairly large agricultural workforce and in light industry or service industries, although many people commute to surrounding cities for work. According to the 2011 Census the valley has a population of approximately 5,000, largely living in one of <b>the</b> <b>dozen</b> or so villages and in isolated farms and hamlets. The average age of the population is 42 years, with unemployment rates of 1–4% of all economically active people aged 16–74, however these figures are approximations because the ward areas covered and described in the census statistics do not relate exactly to the area of the valley. In the Indices of deprivation 2010 all of the areas within the valley were considered to be in the most affluent third in England.|$|E

5|$|The club won {{its first}} FA Cup in 1887, under the {{captaincy}} of another Scotsman, Archie Hunter. They beat West Bromwich Albion 2–0 {{in the final}} held at The Oval. Up until 1885, football had remained an amateur sport. It turned professional in 1885, when the FA legalized professional football, but with a national wage limit. However, the Scottish draper and director of Aston Villa, William McGregor had become frustrated with watching his team in one-sided friendly matches and low attendances for all games but FA Cup ties. He saw {{that in order to}} keep interest in the game alive, the top teams needed to play each other in a league much like American baseball teams did. McGregor wrote to the twelve leading clubs in England proposing the formation of a league, what would later be known as the English Football League. Aston Villa were one of <b>the</b> <b>dozen</b> teams that competed in the inaugural Football League in 1888. Villa's first League game came on 8 September 1888, when they drew 1–1 Wolverhampton Wanderers as Tom Green scored the club's first League goal.
