25|$|During the 1980s, the Japanese economy shifted its {{emphasis}} from {{primary and secondary}} activities (notably agriculture, manufacturing, and mining) to processing, with telecommunications and computers becoming increasingly vital. Information became an important resource and product, central to wealth and power. The rise of an information-based economy was led by major research in highly sophisticated technology, such as advanced computers. The selling and use of information became very beneficial to the economy. Tokyo became a major financial center, {{home to some of}} the world's major banks, financial firms, insurance companies, and the world's largest stock exchange, the Tokyo Securities and Stock Exchange. Even here, however, the recession took its toll. In 1992, <b>the</b> <b>Nikkei</b> 225 stock average began the year at 23,000 points, but fell to 14,000 points in mid-August before leveling off at 17,000 {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
