30|$|Renewable energy {{accommodation}} capacity is constrained by system power source characteristics, structure of large power grid, load distribution and so on. This paper mainly studies {{influence of the}} utilization level of inter-provincial <b>tie-lines</b> on renewable energy {{accommodation capacity}}. Based on time series production simulation model of renewable energy, a renewable energy accommodation capacity calculation model considering the utilization level of inter-provincial <b>tie-lines</b> is proposed. The renewable energy accommodation capacity of “three north” region in 2020 is calculated by the proposed model. Based on the differences of curve constraints, power constraints and stability constraints of provincial, inter-provincial and inter-regional corridors, four different schemes are designed for comparative analysis. Through the case study, {{it is found that}} making full use of inter-provincial and inter-regional <b>tie-lines</b> can effectively enhance renewable energy accommodation capacity in Northwest, Northeast and North China, and the improvement of utilization level of inter-provincial and inter-regional <b>tie-lines</b> in Northwest and Northeast has relatively obvious effect on the promotion of the renewable energy accommodation capacity. The study in this paper is the basis of renewable energy accommodation research, which can provide a strong support for grid planning and dispatching control.|$|R

The effects of the parameters on the resonant magnitude of the <b>tie-line</b> power are also discussed. The frequency domain analysis reveals that TSWS can excite large <b>tie-line</b> power oscillations if the frequency of TSWS approaches the <b>tie-line</b> resonant frequency, especially in the case that the wind farm is integrated into a relatively small grid and the <b>tie-line</b> of the interconnected system is weak.

Results at lower cholesterol concentrations support the existence of a different two-phase coexistence region of Ld and So phases and the existence of a three-phase region separating the two two-phase regions.

30|$|In particular, {{this paper}} {{focuses on the}} impact of cross-provincial <b>tie-lines</b> on the {{renewable}} energy accommodation capacity, and stability constraint is one of the important factors. This constraint is considered in the analysis of the calculation model. That is to say, the power limit of <b>tie-lines</b> is set in the process of simulation analysis, which is generally larger than the power limit under the power plan constraints. It is determined by the physical parameters of power system itself. However, the specific reasons are not discussed in detail in this paper.|$|R

30|$|In the LOMGRAV survey, however, also intersections of {{traverse}} lines exist, both in {{the main}} survey area and in the radial flight lines from and to the three airfields (Fig. 1 (a, b)). Additionally, some flights included sections {{from more than one}} traverse line or parts of traverse lines were flown more than once. Occasionally, intersecting or overlapping lines were flown at different altitudes. Furthermore, each of the three prominent tie-lines (North, Centre, South) are broken up into partly overlapping sections. To account for these features, some of the lines with deviating altitude were removed and an adaptive line levelling procedure was performed on the reduced survey data ΔFsurvey. In this procedure, we distinguish between <b>tie-line</b> cross-over differences and traverse-line cross-over differences. Firstly, the flight lines were split into separate traverse lines and tie-lines. Spacing is about 12 to 15 km for the traverse lines in the main survey area, 316 km between the North <b>tie-line</b> and the Centre <b>tie-line</b> and 240 km between the Centre and the South <b>tie-line</b> (Fig. 1 (b)). The North, Centre and South <b>tie-line</b> consists of two, three and four partly overlapping sections, respectively. Secondly, the sections of each <b>tie-line</b> were merged by shifting ΔFsurvey by a constant offset for each section such that the shifted data mean values are identical in the overlapping parts. The offsets are between − 3.9 nT and − 21.1 nT and the mean values are based on about 150 to 1200 measurements, which show a similar variation in the overlapping region. Thirdly, for each merged <b>tie-line,</b> the <b>tie-line</b> cross-over differences were calculated and the <b>tie-line</b> was adjusted by the straight line fit to the cross-over differences. The <b>tie-line</b> cross-over differences after adjustment and the traverse-line cross-over differences are shown in Fig. 1 (b). The fourth step is based on the adjusted <b>tie-line</b> cross-over differences. Traverse lines that intersect only two tie-lines were DC-shifted by the mean value of the two <b>tie-line</b> cross-over differences. Traverse lines that intersect three tie-lines were adjusted by a cubic spline function through the three <b>tie-line</b> cross-over differences plus two artificial end points equal to the most adjacent cross-over data, that were added to stabilise the fit. A fifth step is taking into account traverse line crossover differences from traverse line intersections or repeatedly flown traverse lines, that otherwise pose a problem for gridding, but also give an opportunity to make additional adjustments in the line levelling. This is especially an advantage for the traverse lines that only cross two tie-lines (adjusted by a DC shift in step four). One traverse line after the other was adjusted by a cubic spline similar as in step four, but this time the cubic spline was fitted to both <b>tie-line</b> cross-over differences as well traverse line cross-over differences.|$|E

The proposed controller fulfills two main objectives, namely, minimum Integral Squared Error of the system output and maximum closed loop stability of the system. The optimal Proportional plus Integral controller, obtained by the proposed design, ensures a compromise between Integral Squared Error criterion and Maximum Stability Margin criterion.

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{and efficiency of}} phenol extraction from the industrial water using different solvents, were investigated. To our knowledge, the experimental information available in the literature for liquid-liquid equilibria of ternary mixtures containing the pair phenol-water is limited. Therefore {{the purpose of the}} present investigation is to generate the data for the water-phenol with different solvents to aid the correlation of liquid-liquid equilibria, including phase diagrams, distribution coefficients of phenol, <b>tie-lines</b> data and selectivity of the solvents for the aqueous phenol system. The ternary equilibrium diagrams and <b>tie-lines</b> data for systems containing Water-Phenol-Benzene, Water-Phenol-Chloroform, Water-Phenol-iso-Butyl Acetate, Water-Phenol-Butanol, Water-Phenol-Ethyl Methyl Keton and Water-Phenol-Toluene, were determined at 303 K and atmospheric pressure. The capacity and selectivity of these organic solvents in each of these systems were determined from the <b>tie-lines</b> data. The capacity of the isobutyle acetate was found to be the highest among the other solvents, and its selectivity was also the highest. Similar results also were obtained for the ethyl methyl keton but gave less capacity and selectivity as compared to the isobutyle acetate. It can be concluded that both isobutyle acetate and ethyl methyl keton are good solvents for extraction of phenol from industrial water. The liquid-liquid equilibrium data of ternary systems were correlated to the NRTL, UNIQUAC and UNIFAC models of activity coefficient to determine their adjustable parameters. The standard deviations from experimental compositions were calculated. Results show that the correlation may be greatly improved by applying the NRTL model with the regression criteria based on minimizing the experimental and calculating distribution coefficients SK to give an average value of the root mean square deviation about 1. 436 % and in terms of the average errors in the distribution ratio for all <b>tie-lines</b> about 10. 776 %. <br /...|$|R
