5|$|One study {{looked at}} how reward {{discounting}} is context specific. By differing {{the time and}} space between small and large rewards, {{they were able to}} test how these factors affected the decision making in <b>tamarins</b> <b>and</b> <b>marmosets.</b> They showed that tamarins will travel longer distances for larger food rewards, but will not wait as long as marmosets. Conversely, marmosets will wait longer, but will not travel as far. They then concluded that this discounting behavior directly correlates to the normal feeding behavior of species. The tamarins feed over large distances, looking for insects. Capturing and eating insects requires a quick and impulsive decision and action. The marmosets, on the other hand, eat tree sap, which takes more time to secrete, but does not require that the marmosets to cover large distances.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} suggests that polyandry is the dominant social structure in the Callitrichidae subfamily of New World monkeys. The Callitrichidae family includes marmosets and tamarins, two groups of small New World monkeys found in South America. Wild groups usually consist of three to ten individuals, with one reproductively active female, one or more reproductive males, and several nonreproductive helpers that can be either male or female. Interestingly, cooperative polyandry {{is not the only}} mating system found in these primates. Polyandrous, monogamous, and polygynous groups can be found within the same population, and a group can even change mating systems, making it the most flexible mating system of any non-human primate. Unlike most primates who typically give birth to single young, twins are the average litter size for <b>tamarins</b> <b>and</b> <b>marmosets.</b> The entire group participates in raising the offspring, sharing the responsibilities of infant carrying, feeding, and grooming. The presence of nonreproductive helpers appears {{to be the most important}} factor in determining which mating system is used, as ecological and environmental variability have not been found to have a significant impact. Goldizen (1987) proposed the hypothesis that monogamy in Callitrichidae should develop only in groups with nonreproductive helpers to help raise the young, and in the absence of these helpers, both polyandrous males and females would have higher reproductive success than those in lone monogamous pairs. Indeed, in studies of Saguinus fuscicollis, common name saddle-back tamarin, no monogamous lone pairs have ever been seen to attempt a breeding cycle.|$|E
500|$|The Central American {{squirrel}} monkey {{is a member}} of the family Cebidae, the family of New World monkeys containing {{squirrel monkey}}s, capuchin monkeys, <b>tamarins</b> <b>and</b> <b>marmosets.</b> Within the family Cebidae, it {{is a member of}} the subfamily Saimiriinae, the subfamily containing squirrel monkeys.

[...] In 1977, Philip Hershkovitz classified Geoffroy's tamarin as a subspecies of the cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus), which resides exclusively in Colombia, based on fur coloration, cranial and mandibular morphology, and ear size. [...] However, more recent research indicates that the two taxa differ sufficiently to be considered separate species.|$|E

40|$|It {{was shown}} by Southern {{hybridization}} that cotton-top <b>tamarin</b> <b>and</b> common <b>marmoset,</b> New World monkeys, carry {{three or more}} genes encoding beta-microseminoprotein, also known as PSP 94. In contrast, the genomes of Old World monkeys, as represented by rhesus macaque and sacred baboon, contain a single gene. Clones containing three different genes encoding beta-microseminoprotein were isolated from a cotton-top tamarin genomic library. They carry two complete genes of four exons and a third gene lacking the first exon. The structure suggests that the three genes are functionally active and give rise to transcripts that are approximately 86 % similar in sequence. By sequencing one gene in full, it was shown that the introns carry an excess of interspersed repeats, on average 29 % of the introns consist of Alu repeats.

5000|$|The {{harpy eagle}} is an {{actively}} hunting carnivore {{and is an}} apex predator. Adults are {{near the top of}} a food chain but are preyed upon by ocelots and jaguars. Its main prey are tree-dwelling mammals and a majority of the diet has been shown to focus on sloths and monkeys. Research conducted by Aguiar-Silva between 2003 and 2005 in a nesting site in Parintins, Amazonas, Brazil, collected remains from prey offered to the nestling by its parents and after sorting them, concluded, in terms of individuals preyed upon, the harpy's prey basis was composed in 79% by sloths from two species: Bradypus variegatus amounting to 39% of the individual prey base, and Choloepus didactylus to 40%; various monkeys amounted to 11.6% of the same prey base. In a similar research venture in Panama, where a couple of captive-bred subadults was released, 52% of the male's captures and 54% of the female's were of two sloth species (Bradypus variegatus and Choloepus hoffmanni). At one Venezuelan nest, the remains comprised sloths. Monkeys regularly taken can include capuchin monkeys, saki monkeys, howler monkeys, titi monkeys, squirrel monkeys, and spider monkeys. Smaller monkeys, such as <b>tamarins</b> <b>and</b> <b>marmosets,</b> are seemingly ignored as prey by this species. At several nest in Guyana, monkeys made up about 37% of the prey remains found at the nests. Similarly, cebid monkeys made up 35% of the remains found at 10 nests in Amazonian Ecuador. Other partially arboreal and even land mammals are also preyed on given the opportunity, including porcupines, squirrels, opossums, anteaters, armadillos, and even relatively large carnivores such as kinkajous, coatis, and tayras. In the Pantanal, a pair of nesting eagles preyed largely on the porcupine (Coendou prehensilis) and the agouti (Dasyprocta azarae). The eagle may also attack bird species such as macaws: At the Parintins research site, the red-and-green macaw made up for 0.4% of the prey base, with other birds amounting to 4.6%." [...] Other parrots have also been preyed on, as well as cracids such as curassows and seriemas. Additional prey items reported include reptiles such as iguanas, tejus, and snakes. Snakes up to 5 cm in diameter have been observed to be cut in half, then the pieces are swallowed whole. On occasion, larger prey such as capybaras, peccaries, and deer are taken and they are usually taken to a stump or low branch and partially eaten, since they are too heavy to be carried whole to the nest. Red brocket deer, a species commonly weighing over 30 kg, have been reportedly taken and, in such cases, the eagle may have to tear it into pieces or feed on it at the killing site rather than fly with it, as it would be too heavy. The harpy has been recorded as taking domestic livestock, including chickens, lambs, goats, and young pigs, but this is extremely rare under normal circumstances. They control the population of mesopredators such as capuchin monkeys which prey extensively on bird's eggs and which (if not naturally controlled) may cause local extinctions of sensitive species.|$|E

40|$|Foraging {{decisions}} in nonhuman animals often require choosing between small, immediate food rewards and larger, more delayed rewards. Faced with such choices, animals typically discount or devalue the future quite strongly. Although discounting studies often focus on delays to reward access, other temporal intervals contribute to foraging rate, and thus may potentially influence discounting levels. Here, {{we examine the}} effect of handling time, the time required to process and consume food, on discounting in cottontop tamarins, Saguinus oedipus, and common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus, two species that differ in levels of temporal discounting. We presented subjects with a discounting task under two conditions. In the first condition, we made the entire reward available after the delay expired. In the second condition, we experimentally increased the minimum length of time required to consume the reward to simulate a longer handling time. We found that <b>tamarins</b> <b>and</b> <b>marmosets</b> showed sensitivity to increases in the time necessary to process food rewards. Both species adjusted their preferences to account for different handling times at long delays to accessing food. Consequently, models of discounting behaviour that include handling times may better describe animal choices than models that focus exclusively on delays prior to access...|$|E
