5|$|Ruiz {{notes that}} writing {{also has the}} power to {{transform}} reality. It brings the reader back to the past, allowing the reader to comprehend myths or distorted stories told by historians. Ruiz contends that knowing <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>is</b> crucial to one's understanding of the present that takes us to postmodernism, and argues that The Feast of the Goat can thus be seen as a postmodern discourse that gives power to history recreation.|$|E
5|$|A Link to <b>the</b> <b>Past</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the best-selling}} SNES games, with 4.61 million units sold worldwide, and has had an {{exceptionally}} long stay on Nintendo Powers top games list (ranking number 2 in Nintendo Power's last issue in December 2012): when the SNES list was finally retired, A Link to the Past had more than five consecutive years in the number one spot. It was re-released as a Player's Choice title in North America, indicating that it has sold a minimum of one million copies there. In the United States, A Link to the Pasts Game Boy Advance version alone sold 1.4 million copies and earned $41 million by August 2006. During the period between January 2000 and August 2006, it was the 8th highest-selling game launched for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS or PlayStation Portable in that country.|$|E
5|$|The Historia Ecclesiastica was copied {{often in}} the Middle Ages, and about 160 manuscripts {{containing}} it survive. About half of those are located on the European continent, {{rather than on the}} British Isles. Most of the 8th- and 9th-century texts of Bede's Historia come from the northern parts of the Carolingian Empire. This total does not include manuscripts with only a part of the work, of which another 100 or so survive. It was printed for the first time between 1474 and 1482, probably at Strasbourg, France. Modern historians have studied the Historia extensively, and a number of editions have been produced. For many years, early Anglo-Saxon history was essentially a retelling of the Historia, but recent scholarship has focused as much on what Bede did not write as what he did. The belief that the Historia was the culmination of Bede's works, the aim of all his scholarship, a belief common among historians in <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>is</b> no longer accepted by most scholars.|$|E

25|$|The {{poppy straw}} methods predominate in Continental Europe and the British Commonwealth, with the latex method in most common use in India.

For example, clicks can contain significant energy in frequencies greater than 110 kHz (for comparison, it is unusual for a human to be able to hear sounds above 20 kHz), requiring that equipment have a sampling rates of at least 220kHz; MHz-capable hardware is often used.|$|E
25|$|She {{developed}} a deep association with folksinger and social activist Utah Phillips throughout the mid-1990s, sharing her stage and her {{audience with the}} older musician {{until his death in}} 2008 and resulting in two collaborative albums: The Past Didn't Go Anywhere, 1996, and Fellow Workers,1999 (with liner notes by Howard Zinn). <b>The</b> <b>Past</b> <b>is</b> built around Phillips's storytelling, an important part of his art that had not previously been documented on recordings; on the album, DiFranco provides musical settings for his speaking voice. The followup, Fellow Workers, was recorded live in Daniel Lanois's Kingsway Studio in New Orleans and features Phillips fronting DiFranco's touring band for a collection of songs and stories.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{examples}} such as {{the case}} of Kennewick Man have illustrated the tensions between Native Americans and archaeologists, which can be summarized as a conflict between a need to remain respectful toward sacred burial sites and the academic benefit from studying them. For years, American archaeologists dug on Indian burial grounds and other places considered sacred, removing artifacts and human remains to storage facilities for further study. In some cases human remains were not even thoroughly studied but instead archived rather than reburied. Furthermore, Western archaeologists' views of the past often {{differ from those of}} tribal peoples. The West views time as linear; for many natives, it is cyclic. From a Western perspective, <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>is</b> long-gone; from a native perspective, disturbing the past can have dire consequences in the present.|$|E

25|$|Grimwood's {{impressive}} debut novel, Breakthrough (Ballantine, 1976), {{was heavily}} influenced by EC Comics, concluding its blend of science fiction, reincarnation and horror elements with a surprising and unpredictable twist ending. Cured of epilepsy by a breakthrough in medical technology, 26-year-old Elizabeth Austin has miniature electrodes implanted in her brain. She can control her seizures by pressing an external remote to activate the electrodes. Adjusting to a normal life, she is ready to patch up a troubled marriage and resume her abandoned career. However, {{as part of the}} implant operation, Elizabeth gave her consent for the insertion of extra electrodes, featuring experimental functions unknown to science. When one of those electrodes is stimulated, Elizabeth experiences memories which are not her own. She discovers the remote has given her the ability to eavesdrop on her previous life 200 years in the past, and she keeps this a secret from her doctor. Intrigued, she finds the earlier existence appealing and begins to spend more and more time there. Eventually, she discovers that the woman in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>is</b> a murderess who is plotting to kill Elizabeth's husband in the present.|$|E

25|$|How {{far south}} {{the area of}} Sami {{population}} in Norway extended in <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>is</b> an uncertain topic, and is currently debated among historians and archeologists. The Norwegian historian Yngvar Nielsen was commissioned by the Norwegian government in 1889 to determine this question in order to settle the contemporary question of Sami land rights. He concluded that the Sami had lived no further south than Lierne in Nord-Trøndelag county until around 1500, when they had started moving south, reaching the area around Lake Femunden in the 18th century. This hypothesis is still accepted among many historians, but {{has been the subject}} of scholarly debate in the 21st century. In favour of Nielsen's view, it is pointed out that no Sami settlement to the south of Lierne in medieval times has left any traces in written sources. This argument is countered by pointing out that the Sami culture was nomadic and non-literary, and as such would not be expected to leave written sources. In recent years, the number of archaeological finds that are interpreted as indicating a Sami presence in Southern Norway in the Middle Ages, has increased. These include foundations in Lesja, in Vang in Valdres and in Hol and Ål in Hallingdal. Proponents of the Sami interpretations of these finds assume a mixed populations of Norse and Sami people in the mountainous areas of Southern Norway in the Middle Ages.|$|E
25|$|Tuten spent 15 years {{heading the}} {{graduate}} program in creative {{writing at the}} City College of New York, which he co-founded. In that capacity, he championed the work of students Walter Mosley, Oscar Hijuelos, Philip Graham, Aurelie Sheehan, Salar Abdoh, Ernesto Quiñonez, and many others.

Tuten's short fiction has appeared in Granta, Conjunctions, Fence, Fiction, The New Review of Literature, Tri-Quarterly, and Harper's Magazine. In 1973, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Writing and in 2001 was given the Award for Distinguished Writing from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In describing his usage of the past in his novels (where many of them are set), Tuten once stated:The fact that I don’t write about contemporary life doesn’t mean I’m any less taken up with it. I find it too limiting to write about contemporary life just in contemporary diction, however. I don’t think there's enough flexibility. I can imagine writing about characters who feel passion for one another in a contemporary setting but I don’t, as yet, hear the language for that. But I’m always thinking about contemporary life vis a vis the way it looks in the past. I mean how it looks in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>is</b> a reflection of what it is today. That's what interests me. I think I’m always talking about present-day life, not only political life but about the quality of passion, the quality of all relationships and love.|$|E
