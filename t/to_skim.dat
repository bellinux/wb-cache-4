They would do this by filling in the first three tiers (with one, two, and four people) with phony names, ensuring they get the first seven payouts, at eight times the buy-in sum, without paying a single penny themselves. So if the buy-in were $5,000, they would receive $40,000, paid for by the first eight investors. They would continue to buy in underneath the real investors, and promote and prolong the scheme {{for as long as possible}} to allow them <b>to</b> <b>skim</b> even more from it before it collapses.|$|E

The Fred role was played by William Frawley, who was actually 22 years her senior. Despite their exceptional chemistry, comedic timing, and musical prowess together onscreen, Vance and Frawley did not get along offscreen. According to some reports, things first went sour when Frawley overheard Vance complaining about his age, stating that he should be playing her father instead of her husband.

2500|$|In 2013, Yvyes Bigerel and Mark Waid of Marvel Comics {{launched}} an initiative {{to create and}} publish digital comics under the title Marvel ReEvolution. While creating these webcomics, Bigerel and Waid were inspired by {{the manner in which}} time is experienced within comics, as the passage of time in a comic book is ultimately controlled by its reader. Rather than to allow readers <b>to</b> <b>skim</b> through the images on a whim or to increase the space between panels as McCloud suggested, the duo stacked the panels up [...] "like a PowerPoint slideshow," [...] forcing the reader to look at one panel at a time. According to Comic Book Resources, this design directly affects how a comic is created and read, as surprises can be better controlled and a letterer could directly control the reading order of text balloons. Rachel Edidin of Wired said of Wolverine: Japan's Most Wanted and Iron Man: Fatal Frontier that [...] "these are comics that truly feel native to the digital format." ...|$|E
