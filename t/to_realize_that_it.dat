5|$|Emerging {{technologies}} such as X-rays gave physicians new diagnostic tools, revealing the intervertebral disc {{as a source for}} back pain in some cases. In 1938, orthopedic surgeon Joseph S. Barr reported on cases of disc-related sciatica improved or cured with back surgery. As a result of this work, in the 1940s, the vertebral disc model of low back pain took over, dominating the literature through the 1980s, aiding further by the rise of new imaging {{technologies such}} as CT and MRI. The discussion subsided as research showed disc problems to be a relatively uncommon cause of the pain. Since then, physicians have come <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is unlikely that a specific cause for low back pain can be identified in many cases and question the need to find one at all as most of the time symptoms resolve within 6 to 12 weeks regardless of treatment.|$|E
25|$|It {{had seemed}} like the {{beginning}} of happiness, and Clarissa is still sometimes shocked, {{more than thirty years}} later, <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was happiness; that the entire experience lay in a kiss and a walk, the anticipation of dinner and a book...What lives undimmed in Clarissa's mind more than three decades later is a kiss at dusk on a patch of dead grass, and a walk around a pond as mosquitoes droned in the darkening air. There is still that singular perfection, and it's perfect in part because it seemed, at the time, so clearly to promise more. Now she knows: That was the moment, right then. There has been no other. p98, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{expanding}} Siegfried's Tod {{into a series}} of two or more operas would have been particularly appealing to Wagner, as he had now come <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be impossible to say all that he wanted to in a single opera without an inordinate number of digressions. The political events {{of the past few years}} and his recent discovery of the philosophy of Ludwig Feuerbach had greatly enlarged the scope of ideas which he hoped to explore in his new opera. He also wished to incorporate various ideas that he had been mulling over in the works on Jesus, Frederick, Achilles and Wieland (all four of which had been effectively abandoned by now). These ideas ranged over the politics of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Mikhail Bakunin and the philosophy of Hegel and the Young Hegelians.|$|E

500|$|The Wrath of Khan {{features}} several recurring themes, including death, resurrection, {{and growing}} old. Upon writing his script, Meyer hit upon {{a link between}} Spock's death {{and the age of}} the characters. [...] "This {{was going to be a}} story in which Spock died, so it was going to be a story about death, and it was only a short hop, skip, and a jump <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was going to be about old age and friendship," [...] Meyer said. [...] "I don't think that any of [...] scripts were about old age, friendship, and death." [...] In keeping with the theme of death and rebirth symbolized by Spock's sacrifice and the Genesis Device, Meyer wanted to call the film The Undiscovered Country, in reference to Prince Hamlet's description of death in William Shakespeare's Hamlet, but the title was changed during editing without his knowledge. Meyer disliked Wrath of Khan, but it was chosen because the preferred Vengeance of Khan conflicted with Lucasfilm's forthcoming Revenge of the Jedi (renamed Return of the Jedi late in production).|$|E

Months before this, Madonna noticed changes in her mother's {{behavior}} and personality from the attentive homemaker she was, but did not understand the reasons. Mrs. Ciccone, at a loss to explain her dire medical condition, would often begin to cry when questioned by Madonna, at which point Madonna would respond by wrapping her arms around her mother tenderly. [...] "I remember feeling stronger than she was", Madonna recalled, [...] "I was so little and yet I felt like she was the child." [...] Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying. [...] "There was so much left unsaid, so many untangled and unresolved emotions, of remorse, guilt, loss, anger, confusion.... I saw my mother, looking very beautiful and lying as if she were asleep in an open casket. Then I noticed that my mother's mouth looked funny.

Although unhappy with the arrangement, Mao agreed to go through with the marriage, with the wedding taking place in 1907 or 1908. According to his later account however, he never consummated the marriage and refused to live with Luo. Instead, he claimed that he made use of connections with his maternal family to leave his parental home and move into the house of an unemployed student in Shaoshan, where he lived for a year. There, he continued his reading, enjoying tales of ancient Chinese rulers such as Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian and Ban Gu's History of the Former Han Dynasty. He was also influenced by Feng Guifen's Personal Protests from the Study of Jiao Bin, which had been compiled in 1861. Like Guanying's book, it called on China to adopt foreign techniques to strengthen itself, and to use them to defend itself from foreign aggression. Mao also read a pamphlet by the Chinese revolutionary Chen Tianhua, which recounted China's loss of sovereignty to Japanese and European imperialists; [...] Mao claimed that this was a great influence on him, for after reading it [...] "I felt depressed about the future of my country and began <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was the duty of all the people to help save it." [...] Meanwhile, Luo was locally disgraced and eventually died of dysentery in 1910, while Qimei moved to live with her brother's family in her native village of Xiangxiang.|$|E

Tina Charles of TV Guide {{was happy to}} see Jim Beaver become more involved in the storyline, and praised Ackles for his [...] "amazing job" [...] during the confrontation between the two Deans. She described the latter scenes as [...] "seamless, yet painful to watch". Although Charles {{was happy to see}} the Colt get stolenshe thought the weapon was [...] "too easy" [...] and had lost its mystiqueshe noted her annoyance that the brothers continue to [...] "look ridiculous" [...] because Bela is able to steal things from them. Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune gave the episode an A-. Despite the [...] "sluggish pacing" [...] of the first half, the [...] "paternal baggage" [...] and monster of the week [...] "built up enough emotional resonance to triumph". She noted the actors' performances, such as the [...] "great Winchester moment" [...] in which Sam discusses Dean's demonic pact; for Peterson, [...] "...the dark, wounded look in Jared Padalecki's eyes totally sells it". The [...] "brutally good character writing" [...] and [...] "truly impressive work" [...] done for Dean's dream-encounter with himself was also lauded, with Peterson writing, [...] "Ackles gives two of his best performances {{in the history of the}} show. At the same time." [...] Like Charles, however, she pointed out how [...] "uncharacteristically stupid about Bela" [...] the Winchesters have been. She commented, [...] "Bela appears to have eaten the writers' brains for breakfast." [...] The episode received a score of 7 out of 7 from TV Squad's Brett Love. Bobby's backstory at first was a [...] "bit of a shock" [...] for him, but he eventually came <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> [...] "fits very well".

Clarissa tries {{to be grateful for}} the moment she is inhabiting, cutting the stems off roses at the kitchen sink. She thinks of the holiday she had when she was eighteen with Louis and Richard, a time when [...] "it seemed anything could happen, anything at all" [...] (p95).

Clarissa (Vaughan) realizes without that holiday and the house where she, Richard and Louis spent it, so many events would not have occurred, including this moment now, standing in a kitchen cutting flowers for her best friend, Richard's, party. She remembers telling herself at the time she was not betraying Louis by sleeping with Richard, it was the free-wheeling 1960's, Louis was aware of what was going on. She wonders what might have happened if she had tried to remain with Richard. She imagines that other future, [...] "full of infidelities and great battles; as a vast and enduring romance laid over friendship so searing and profound it would accompany them to the grave...She could have had a life as potent and dangerous as literature itself." [...] "Or then again maybe not," [...] Clarissa thinks. She realizes that maybe there is nothing equal to the recollection of having been young.

2500|$|A visitor's {{commentary}} of this {{clock was}} given after his visit {{in the summer}} of 1855 by Theodore Nielsen, a Danish kleinsmith journeyman in his memoirs. As follows. [...] "Everybody knows about the cathedral which is called Munsteren. There is a unique clock in the tower. Surely {{the only one in the}} entire world. It shows all time changes, Sun and moon eclipses besides the ordinary times of day. On top of the clock is a niche in which stands Death with a bell in one hand and a crossbone in the other. With this bone he hits the bell each hour to count the time. A Christ figure stands in yet another niche. On each side is a door, and when the clock strikes twelve the left hand door opens and the twelve apostles appear, one at a time. Each one bows deeply before Jesus who in turn lifts his right hand in benediction. Each one then disappears through the door to the right. When Judas appears Jesus hides his face in a fold of his cape. Besides all this there is an enormous rooster that crows and flaps his wings at the same time the Death figure hits the bell with the bone. Above and to the right is a life sized figure, a replica of the man who made the clock. He sits and looks down on his handiworks and you have to look twice <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is not a living person sitting there. Parisians wanted a clock just like that for the Cathedral of Notre Dame. So the burghers of Strassburgh blinded the artist in order to make him unable to undertake the commission. He then asked to be taken up into the tower just once more and this was granted. While up there he put the mechanism out of commission, and the clock was stopped for many years. Several able watchmakers volunteered their entire time to try to get the clock to work again. Some of them became deranged of sheer frustration. But at last someone found the key and since then the clock performs perfectly once more." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, {{shortly after}} the Boston Globe {{disclosed}} that Bulger and Flemmi had been informants, Weeks met with retired agent John Connolly (later sentenced to 40 years in prison), who showed him a photocopy of Bulger's FBI informant file. In order to explain Bulger and Flemmi's status as informants, Connolly said, [...] "The Mafia was going against Jimmy and Stevie, so Jimmy and Stevie went against them." [...] According to Weeks, [...] "As I read over the files at the Top of the Hub that night, Connolly kept telling me that 90 percent of {{the information in the}} files came from Stevie. Certainly Jimmy hadn't been around the Mafia the way Stevie had. But, Connolly told me, he had to put Jimmy's name on the files to keep his file active. As long as Jimmy was an active informant, Connolly said, he could justify meeting with Jimmy and giving him valuable information. Even after he retired, Connolly still had friends in the FBI, and he and Jimmy kept meeting to let each other know what was going on. I listened to all that, but now I understood that even though he was retired, Connolly was still getting information, as well as money, from Jimmy. As I continued to read, I could see {{that a lot of the}} reports were not just against the Italians. There were more and more names of Polish and Irish guys, of people we had done business with, of friends of mine. Whenever I came across the name of someone I knew, I would read exactly what it said about that person. I would see, over and over again, that some of these people had been arrested for crimes that were mentioned in these reports. It didn't take long for me <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had been bullshit when Connolly told me that the files hadn't been disseminated, that they had been for his own personal use. He had been an employee of the FBI. He hadn't worked for himself. If there was some investigation going on and his supervisor said, 'Let me take a look at that,' what was Connolly going to do? He had to give it up. And he obviously had. I thought about what Jimmy had always said, 'You can lie to your wife and to your girlfriends, but not to your friends. Not to anyone we're in business with.' Maybe Jimmy and Stevie hadn't lied to me. But they sure hadn't been telling me everything." ...|$|E
