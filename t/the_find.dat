5|$|Leaders' ideological {{power was}} based on {{apparent}} access to deities and the supernatural. Evidence regarding Norte Chico religion is limited: {{an image of the}} Staff God, a leering figure with a hood and fangs, has been found on a gourd dated to 2250 BC. The Staff God is a major deity of later Andean cultures, and Winifred Creamer suggests <b>the</b> <b>find</b> points to worship of common symbols of gods. As with much other research at Norte Chico, the nature and significance of <b>the</b> <b>find</b> has been disputed by other researchers.|$|E
5|$|Mission {{managers}} {{called up}} to the crew to alert them of <b>the</b> <b>find,</b> advising Altman ("Scooter") {{that one of the}} orbiter's wing leading edge sensors recorded a debris event during ascent, around 104 – 106 seconds following liftoff, which may have been the cause of the damage seen in that area.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>finds</b> from Centuripe itself {{have all}} {{apparently}} come from graves, though most earlier finds were illicitly excavated and so lacked proper archaeological provenances.

5|$|A second {{specimen}} {{was obtained}} in 1966 and <b>the</b> <b>find</b> {{was published in}} 1971 by Hugh Genoways and Knox Jones, who noted that the species is closely similar to O.palustris. Later workers affirmed the relationship between O.dimidiatus, O.palustris and associated species like O.couesi. Fiona Reid reported in 1997 that a third specimen had been found. In 2006, Marcelo Weksler and coworkers removed most of the species formerly placed in Oryzomys from the genus, {{because they are not}} closely related to the type species O.palustris, but kept O.dimidiatus as an Oryzomys.|$|E
5|$|Balch's {{investigations}} into geomorphology and hydrology {{led to his}} decision {{to try to find}} the origins of the water that rose to the surface at Wookey Hole Caves, the source of the River Axe. In 1901, he led a team of miners and cavers to dig into Swildon's Hole, where he found the 'Forty Foot Pot' as well as chambers full of stalagmites. Despite the publicity around <b>the</b> <b>find,</b> Balch refused to disclose the location of the cave as he believed it was too dangerous for amateur explorers. The farmer who owned the land denied them entrance the following year, turning the valley into a fish farm, so the team headed upstream where they discovered Eastwater Cavern, one of Balch's personal favourites.|$|E
5|$|Cope {{travels with}} Knight to Europe; Knight with the {{intention}} of visiting Paris zoos, Cope with the intent of selling off much of his bone collection. Cope has also spent much of his money buying The American Naturalist, a paper in which he plans to attack Marsh's dealings. Hatcher arrives in New York to talk about <b>the</b> <b>find</b> Laelaps; in his speech, he subtly hints at the folly of Marsh's elitism and backstabbing, as well as Cope's collecting obsession.|$|E
50|$|Lorraine Copeland made a {{collection}} of mostly Heavy Neolithic flints from the site in 1966. Amongst <b>the</b> <b>finds</b> were massive trapezoidal axes, chisels, a chopper, points, a pick, rough scrapers, blades, cores and hammerstones. <b>The</b> <b>finds</b> led Andrew Moore to suggest that Bezez cave was a factory site for such tools.|$|R

5|$|During a {{field trip}} to an archeological dig, Cartman discovers a mysterious stone triangle, which he {{promptly}} throws away without interest. Shortly after Kyle picks it up, the guide identifies the writing on the triangle as Anasazi. Kyle appears on television to discuss <b>the</b> <b>find,</b> resulting in a jealous Cartman wanting the triangle back. Cartman constantly pesters Kyle until he returns the triangle to him. Meanwhile, Leonard Maltin comes to South Park and asks Chef whether he has seen Barbra Streisand. Maltin, having seen Kyle and the triangle on television, tells Chef the boys are in great danger.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{the early}} {{occupation}} of Ditton is scant. A Mesolithic tranchet axe, a sharpening flake, three microliths and 36 blades were found at Ditton, but the exact site of <b>the</b> <b>find</b> is now unknown.

5|$|Ground-based telescopes in California, Hawaii, the Canary Islands, Arizona, and Texas, {{as well as}} the Spitzer Space Telescope, {{were used}} to conduct these {{follow-up}} observations and verify Kepler-11b's existence. In particular, the detection of an orbital resonance effect between Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c confirmed <b>the</b> <b>find.</b> Kepler-11b's discovery was announced to the public on February 2, 2011. It is part of the first system discovered with more than three transiting planets, and is also part of the most compact and flat system yet discovered. Kepler-11's planetary system is the second known system to have multiple transiting planets, surpassing the three confirmed planets (two transiting) orbiting the star Kepler-9.|$|E

25|$|After <b>the</b> <b>finds</b> {{have been}} {{examined}} and conserved, {{it is expected that}} they will be claimed by the Crown as treasure trove which will enable museums to apply to keep and display them. The local Member of the Scottish Parliament, Dave Thompson, has called for <b>the</b> <b>finds</b> to be put on display at Ardnamurchan, and local tourism chief John Peel has suggested that a permanent historical exhibition could be established on the peninsula to boost tourism.

5|$|In 2001, a 50% {{complete}} {{skeleton of}} a juvenile Tyrannosaurus was discovered in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana, by a crew from the Burpee Museum of Natural History of Rockford, Illinois. Dubbed Jane, <b>the</b> <b>find</b> was initially considered the first known skeleton of the pygmy tyrannosaurid Nanotyrannus but subsequent research has revealed {{that it is more}} likely a juvenile Tyrannosaurus. It is the most complete and best preserved juvenile example known to date. Jane has been examined by Jack Horner, Pete Larson, Robert Bakker, Greg Erickson, and several other renowned paleontologists, because of the uniqueness of her age. Jane is currently on exhibit at the Burpee Museum of Natural History in Rockford, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{seventeen}} countries produced concentrated uranium oxides, with Canada (27.9% {{of world}} production) and Australia (22.8%) being the largest producers and Kazakhstan (10.5%), Russia (8.0%), Namibia (7.5%), Niger (7.4%), Uzbekistan (5.5%), the United States (2.5%), Argentina (2.1%), Ukraine (1.9%) and China (1.7%) also producing significant amounts. Kazakhstan {{continues to increase}} production and may have become the world's largest producer of uranium by 2009 with an expected production of 12,826tonnes, compared to Canada with 11,100t and Australia with 9,430t. In the late 1960s, UN geologists also discovered major uranium deposits and other rare mineral reserves in Somalia. <b>The</b> <b>find</b> was the largest of its kind, with industry experts estimating the deposits at over 25% of the world's then known uranium reserves of 800,000 tons.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, archaeologists {{found the}} remains of 44 submarines, {{including}} UB-17, off the United Kingdom's southern and east coasts, near the county of Suffolk. <b>The</b> <b>find</b> was made up mostly of vessels from the German Imperial Navy dating to World War I. Der Spiegel reported divers located 41 German U-boats, and three of English submarines, found at depths of up to 50 feet, off England's southern and eastern coasts.|$|E

5|$|Ten objects, {{among them}} {{one of the}} inscribed rings, were stolen shortly after <b>the</b> <b>find</b> was made, and when the {{remaining}} objects were recovered, {{it was discovered that}} the other ring had been cut into at least four pieces by a Bucharest goldsmith, whereby one of the inscribed characters had become damaged to the point of illegibility.

5|$|The Hoxne Hoard {{contains}} several {{rare and}} important objects, including a gold body-chain and silver-gilt pepper-pots (piperatoria), including the Empress pepper pot. The Hoxne Hoard is also of particular archaeological significance {{because it was}} excavated by professional archaeologists with the items largely undisturbed and intact. <b>The</b> <b>find</b> helped to improve the relationship between metal detectorists and archaeologists, and influenced a change in English law regarding finds of treasure.|$|E
5|$|The Texas oil boom, {{sometimes}} called the gusher age, {{was a period of}} dramatic change and economic growth in the U.S. state of Texas during the early 20th century that began with the discovery of a large petroleum reserve near Beaumont, Texas. <b>The</b> <b>find</b> was unprecedented in its size and ushered in an age of rapid regional development and industrialization that has few parallels in U.S. history. Texas quickly became one of the leading oil producing states in the U.S., along with Oklahoma and California; soon the nation overtook the Russian Empire as the top producer of petroleum. By 1940 Texas had come to dominate U.S. production. Some historians even define the beginning of the world's Oil Age as the beginning of this era in Texas.|$|E

50|$|Some days later, {{the metal}} {{detector}} indicated a third metal cache approximately 1.5 m from <b>the</b> first <b>find.</b> <b>The</b> archaeologists concentrated on uncovering <b>the</b> two first <b>finds</b> before {{starting with the}} third.

Only when they tried to lift <b>the</b> <b>finds</b> out of <b>the</b> soil did the archaeologists realize how heavy the hoards were. The smaller weighed 27 kg and the larger one 40 kg. An attempt to X-ray <b>the</b> <b>finds</b> at <b>the</b> local hospital failed because they contained so much silver that the X-ray plates remained blank.|$|R
