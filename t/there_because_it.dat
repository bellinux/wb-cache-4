25|$|Douglas {{set off a}} {{tremendous}} political upheaval with the Kansas–Nebraska Act in 1854. Nebraska Territory, west of Missouri, was then being settled, and Congress needed to provide territorial organization for the region. The Missouri Compromise prohibited slavery <b>there</b> (<b>because</b> <b>it</b> was north of the 36°30' compromise line), and the Compromise of 1850 had reaffirmed this.|$|E
25|$|The Ohio River is a climatic {{transition}} area, as {{its water}} {{runs along the}} periphery of the humid subtropical and humid continental climate areas. It is inhabited by fauna and flora of both climates. In winter, it regularly freezes over at Pittsburgh but rarely further south toward Cincinnati and Louisville. At Paducah, Kentucky, in the south, near the Ohio's confluence with the Mississippi, it is ice-free year-round. Paducah was founded <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is the northernmost ice-free reach of the Ohio.|$|E
25|$|The {{site of the}} Church {{had been}} a temple of Aphrodite before Constantine's edifice was built. Hadrian's temple had {{actually}} been located <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was the junction of the main north-south road {{with one of the}} two main east-west roads and directly adjacent to the forum (which is now the location of the (smaller) Muristan); the forum itself had been placed, as is traditional in Roman towns, at the junction of the main north-south road with the (other) main east-west road (which is now El-Bazar/David Street). The temple and forum together took up the entire space between the two main east-west roads (a few above-ground remains of the east end of the temple precinct still survive in the Alexander Nevsky Church complex of the Russian Mission in Exile).|$|E

50|$|Stow-on-the-Wold was {{prominently}} {{featured in}} the eleventh episode of series 6 of Top Gear, when Jeremy Clarkson reviewed the Ford F-Series there.

25|$|Ethiopia and Eritrea {{subsequently}} remobilized troops {{along the}} border, leading to {{fears that the}} two countries could return to war. On 7 December 2005, Eritrea banned UN helicopter flights and ordered Western members (particularly from the United States, Canada, Europe and Russia) of the UN peacekeeping mission on its border with Ethiopia to leave within 10 days, sparking concerns of further conflict with its neighbour. In November 2006 Ethiopia and Eritrea boycotted an Eritrea–Ethiopia Boundary Commission meeting at The Hague which would have demarcated their disputed border using UN maps. Ethiopia was not <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> does not accept the decision and as it will not allow physical demarcation it will not accept map demarcation, and Eritrea was not there because although it backs the commission's proposals, it insists that the border should be physically marked out.|$|E
500|$|Hurd's belief {{was that}} the ban would place the print and {{broadcast}} media on a level footing, but opponents of the restrictions argued they were affecting the quality of news reporting from Northern Ireland, and consequently people's understanding of the issues. The broadcaster Scarlett McGwire, one of those to challenge the regulations, said in 1989, [...] "The case {{is not just about}} journalists and being able to report Northern Ireland properly. It is about people not being able to understand what is happening <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is not reported properly". Marmaduke Hussey, Chairman of the BBC, called the ban a [...] "very dangerous precedent". A petition organised by the Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom, and including the signatures of 50 MPs, was presented at 10 Downing Street on the first anniversary of its commencement.|$|E
500|$|The fourth {{production}} block, {{consisting of}} [...] "The Hungry Earth" [...] and [...] "Cold Blood", was filmed in October and November 2009 with location filming done in Llanwynno, Wales. Scenes for [...] "Cold Blood" [...] were also filmed at the Plantasia botanical garden in Swansea on 13 November 2009 {{as well as}} in Cardiff's Temple of Peace and other locations and unusual sets for the Silurian city. [...] "The Vampires of Venice" [...] and [...] "Vincent and the Doctor" [...] were filmed mainly in the town of Trogir in Croatia, which was used as Venice and Paris respectively. However, a small crew did go to Venice to take wide shots of coastal buildings; the episode was not filmed <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> would take too long to cover up the modern shops in present-day Venice. Scenes in [...] "The Vampires of Venice" [...] were also filmed at Atlantic College, Caerphilly Castle, Castell Coch, the Town Hall of Trogir, and Llancaich Fawr Manor.|$|E

[...] "Whether they are angry at each other, whether they're happy or sad, we're showing the interaction of two men {{who are trying to}} do the best in life. If we never put one race issue into it, if we never said one word about it, the message is <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> showing how people ought to interrelate, how they ought to work together, how they ought to get along." ...|$|R
500|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature has {{listed the}} bignose shark as Data Deficient overall, due to {{inadequate}} population and fishery monitoring. The species {{is considered to}} be of concern, however, given it is slow-reproducing and faces widespread heavy fishing pressure. There is evidence that its numbers have recently declined in the Maldives. Furthermore, most bignose shark bycatch occurs in international waters, where a single stock may be affected by multiple fisheries. It is listed as a [...] "highly migratory species" [...] under the 1995 UN Agreement on the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, but thus far this has not led to significant conservation measures. Regionally, the IUCN has assessed the bignose shark as Near Threatened in the northwestern Atlantic. Though specific data are lacking, it is suspected to have declined <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is commonly misidentified as the sandbar shark, thus the known decline in sandbar shark numbers resulting from US longline fishing may represent a decline in bignose shark numbers, as well. This species has been assessed as Least Concern in Australian waters, where it faces no significant threats.|$|E
2500|$|Amos had {{initially}} planned {{to record the}} entire album in the American South because [...] "there's a hiddenness about the South, and I {{wanted to go back}} <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was similar to how I felt in my relationships with men," [...] but the bulk of the record was recorded in a church in County Wicklow, Ireland, as well as in New Orleans, Louisiana. Given her religious upbringing, Amos was drawn to record in a church, not in anger, but [...] "with the intention of wholeness and of bringing a fragmented woman back to freedom." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, former Intel Corporation Chairman and CEO Andrew Grove {{looked to}} energy resilience, arguing that {{complete}} independence is unfeasible given {{the global market}} for energy. He describes energy resilience {{as the ability to}} adjust to interruptions in the supply of energy. To that end, he suggests the U.S. make greater use of electricity. Electricity can be produced from a variety of sources. A diverse energy supply will be less affected by the disruption in supply of any one source. He reasons that another feature of electrification is that electricity is [...] "sticky" [...] – meaning the electricity produced in the U.S. is to stay <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> cannot be transported overseas. [...] According to Grove, a key aspect of advancing electrification and energy resilience will be converting the U.S. automotive fleet from gasoline-powered to electric-powered. This, in turn, will require the modernization and expansion of the electrical power grid. As organizations such as The Reform Institute have pointed out, advancements associated with the developing smart grid would facilitate the ability of the grid to absorb vehicles en masse connecting to it to charge their batteries.|$|E
5000|$|Shaw further {{elaborated}} on {{the ideas}} behind the album {{in a career}} retrospective for THUMP: [...] "It's club music. Right now, I feel it's really great how quite functional techno and noise--the kind of stuff I would have played in a bar in 2006 just to annoy people--seems to be this fruitful area of music that is really adventurous and is challenging the idea of what music can be. The appeal of all those noise guys is that, you don't go <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> going to press all of your pleasure buttons, you go <b>there</b> <b>because</b> you get this hypnotic sensation from texture. It works at Berghain, but also at a church in London, or at the Jazz Cafe." ...|$|R

2500|$|In April 2013, Womack {{said that}} she would not rule out a return to EastEnders, and even though Maslen was due to leave, she said Ronnie would still have reasons to return with Roxy still being there. She said, [...] "I think she could go back if Jack wasn't <b>there,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was always the Mitchell sisters. I know Ronnie had a love affair and she got married, but what I loved about the {{character}} was her relationship with her sibling. It was nice being with another woman and doing most of our scenes together. That was a relationship on the show I really enjoyed. There are no plans [...] at the moment but I definitely wouldn't rule it out. I love the show and I love the character. I miss the character enormously." [...] On 17 May 2013, show bosses announced that Womack would return to EastEnders as Ronnie for six months. It was said that Ronnie's return will form a major part of summer and autumn storylines. Speaking of her comeback, Womack said: [...] "I am thrilled to be returning to the role of Ronnie for the next six months. Ronnie is coming out of prison and her reappearance in [...] Square is going to create havoc. I can't wait to be a Mitchell once again!" [...] EastEnders executive producer Lorraine Newman added: [...] "We're delighted to announce Samantha Womack's return to Albert Square. The Mitchell sisters are a fabulous pairing and it will be an absolute delight to have Ronnie and Roxy back together on screen. However, Ronnie's departure wasn't without controversy for many residents in Walford, and her return will be sure to ruffle quite a few feathers." ...|$|E

We found some difficulty in getting away from the corn, though we had selected this spot as one at which the open rolling prairie was specially attainable. As long as I could see a corn-field or a tree I was not satisfied. Nor, indeed, was I satisfied at last. To have been thoroughly on the prairie, and in the prairie, I should have been a day's journey from tilled land. But I doubt whether that could now be done in the State of Illinois. I got out into various patches and brought away specimens of corn--ears bearing sixteen rows of grain, with forty grains in each row, each ear bearing a meal for a hungry man.|$|E
