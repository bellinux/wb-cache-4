5|$|The Harlem Globetrotters invited Russell to {{join their}} {{exhibition}} basketball squad. Russell, who was sensitive to any racial prejudice, was enraged {{by the fact that}} owner Abe Saperstein would only discuss the matter with Woolpert. While Saperstein spoke to Woolpert in a meeting, Globetrotters assistant coach Harry Hanna tried to entertain Russell with jokes. The USF center was livid after this snub and declined the offer: he reasoned that if Saperstein was <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> to speak with him, then he was <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> to play for Saperstein. Instead, Russell made himself eligible for the 1956 NBA draft.|$|E
25|$|Rabinovich, is an archetypal Russian Jew. He is a crafty, cynical, {{sometimes}} bitter type, {{skeptical about}} the Soviet government, and often <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> for his own good. He is sometimes portrayed as an otkaznik ("refusenik"): someone who is refused permission to emigrate to Israel.|$|E
500|$|With his {{controversial}} {{revival of the}} character in 2008, Fabian Nicieza chose to portray the mantle of Anarky as being possessed by a villain other than Lonnie Machin {{on the grounds that}} Lonnie was too heroic to act out the part of a black hat: [...] "Since Lonnie is <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> to be immature and NOT a 'villain,' I wanted Anarky, but it couldn't be Lonnie without compromising who he is as a character." ...|$|E

6000|$|She brooded, {{not looking}} back. She warned {{herself that she}} was {{probably}} exaggerating; that no young man could have all these exalted qualities. Wasn't he <b>too</b> obviously <b>smart,</b> <b>too</b> glossy-new? Like a movie actor. Probably he was a traveling salesman who sang tenor and fancied himself in imitations of Newport clothes and spoke of [...] "the swellest business proposition that ever came down the pike." [...] In a panic she peered at him. No! This was no hustling salesman, this boy with the curving Grecian lips and the serious eyes.|$|R
500|$|In 1995, National Review {{included}} Forrest Gump in {{its list}} of the [...] "Best 100 Conservative Movies" [...] of all time. Then, in 2009, the magazine ranked the film number four on its 25 Best Conservative Movies of the Last 25 Years list. [...] "Tom Hanks plays the title character, an amiable dunce who is far <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> to embrace the lethal values of the 1960s. The love of his life, wonderfully played by Robin Wright Penn, chooses a different path; she becomes a drug-addled hippie, with disastrous results." ...|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. David Hinckley of the New York Daily News {{reported}} that the season premiere episode [...] "never quite [...] its rhythm." [...] Linda Stasi of the New York Post said that [...] "Season 4" [...] had [...] "some good laughs here, but there's also the threat that 30 Rock could easily turn into that thing the writers relentlessly make fun of – TV shows and stars that are too smug, <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> and too out-of-touch for their own good." [...] The Kansas City Stars Aaron Barnhart deemed it as [...] "one of the weakest 30 Rocks" [...] he has ever seen and that he found the episode boring.|$|E

As a prank, Frank and Toofer tell her that several {{people are going to}} be fired. Believing them, Jenna tries to seduce a NBC {{executive}} whom she sees talking to Jack. Liz later notifies Jenna that no one is going to be fired, and that the executive is actually an extra on the show. Jenna aims to get back at the pair, and although Toofer admits that he was <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> for Jenna's tactics, Frank is seen running around naked outside Jack's balcony. Jenna finally gets her chance to perform [...] "Muffin Top", unaware that the show has already ended and the number was scratched at the last moment, thanks to Liz.|$|E

500|$|Within {{a week of}} the episode's {{original}} broadcast, three deleted {{scenes from}} [...] "Beauty Pageant" [...] were made available on the official Parks and Recreation website. In the first 90-second clip, April seeks beauty contestant advice from Leslie, who tells her to act differently from her usual behavior. While awaiting the talent contest, April lists a number of her unusual talents, including inventing emoticons, convincing her mother she is adopted, instantly making security guards suspicious and determining if someone is fat or pregnant [...] "with 60 percent accuracy". In the second 1-minute and 15 second clip, Ann tries to explain to Mark she is not hinting at sex when she asks him to [...] "fix her shower", and Sanderson talks about his insecurities, including that Leslie might be <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> for him. In the final 90-second clip, Tom expresses anger that the swimsuit competition {{has been removed from}} the contest, and tries to convince the judges to reinstate it during their deliberations.|$|E
500|$|Justin Ravitz of PopMatters {{called the}} series a [...] "cleverly trashy postmodern soap" [...] and {{credited}} it for reviving {{the soap opera}} genre, which he felt had disappeared but still suited American culture. He compared the pilot to Sex and the City, declaring it [...] "could potentially replace the departed Sex as the TV Sunday ritual for women and gay men everywhere, although DH is the guiltier pleasure of the two." [...] However, he noted the contrasting tones and dynamics between the two series, and stated that the friendships between Desperate Housewives four leading women seemed [...] "tenuous," [...] opining, [...] "the sisterly, sugar-swapping connection between the surviving women is superficial, and clearly vulnerable to shifting alliances, acts of betrayal and crowd-pleasing cat-fights." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety called the pilot [...] "oodles of fun." [...] He complimented the cast, stating that while Hatcher provides [...] "the emotional core" [...] of the series, [...] "nearly everyone is intriguing {{in one way or}} another," [...] and predicted that Eva Longoria would become the show's breakout star. However, Lowry noted that Desperate Housewives may be [...] "a little <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> for its own good" [...] and expressed concern over the series' [...] "soapy elements." [...] Tom Shales of The Washington Post praised the pilot, assessing, [...] "In visual style, witty language, borderline surrealism and overall mad attitude, [...] stands on a mountaintop all its own, the best new drama of the season and perhaps the best new comedy, too." [...] He complimented Cross and Hatcher's performances, as well as the writing for the Mary Alice character's narrations. The Futon Critic selected the pilot as the 26th best television episode of 2004.|$|E
2500|$|Between this, {{several other}} scenes are shown—Lopez appears {{with very little}} {{clothing}} cavorting in wet sand, swishing her hair during the chorus of the song and dancing [...] "wildly" [...] in a gold outfit covered in glitter.

60|$|Ruth had sped {{home through}} the streets unattended, as she had come, heedless of the rude jostlings and ruder {{greetings}} she met with from those she passed; heedless, <b>too,</b> of the <b>smarting</b> of her injured hand, for the agony of her soul was such that it whelmed all minor sufferings of the flesh.|$|R

"I {{have little}} thought {{of such a}} thing, lady; the matter in hand is <b>too</b> serious for <b>smart</b> sayings," [...] and with another bow he sat himself down on a chair near the hearth, where a fire was burning.

2500|$|The {{book was}} favourably {{reviewed}} in other places, among them such American newspapers as the Los Angeles Times, Monsters and Critics, USA Today, Seattle Times, Chicago Sun-Times and Seattle Post-Intelligencer. However, some reviews were critical; Kirsten Garrett suggested in her review that, The Book of General Ignorance [...] "is {{in danger of}} being <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> for its own good. In fact, a bit smart-arse." [...] She also noted that [...] "It's a disgrace that in a book of this kind there is no index. It's not possible to look up a subject about which you are ignorant".|$|E
2500|$|Among {{those with}} whom Clarissa danced at that year's Liberal Ball was the future double agent Donald Maclean, who complained that she was <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> to be [...] "a proper Liberal girl like the Bonham-Carters or the Asquiths". She also knew Guy Burgess, who fled to Russia in 1951 when he and Maclean {{were about to be}} unmasked as traitors. A 2015 {{biography}} of Burgess, a homosexual, contained claims that, encouraged by his Soviet [...] "handlers", he had contemplated marriage to Clarissa. However, the latter, then aged 95, denied that they had been close. She described Burgess as [...] "courteous, amusing, nice and good company", but said that he had been [...] "standoffish" [...] towards her and did not wish any friendship to develop.|$|E
2500|$|The third verse {{features}} lyrics such as [...] "You wake up, flawless/ Post up, flawless/ Ride {{round in}} it, flawless/ I woke up like this/ I woke up like this." [...] The song ends with another sample from Star Search, in which McMahon announces that Knowles' group lost the competition. In a video commentary to the album, Knowles explained {{that in her}} mind , she would have never imagined losing as a possibility, {{and it was the}} best message for her. [...] "I feel like something about the aggression of 'Bow Down' and the attitude of 'Flawless'—the reality is, sometimes you lose. And you're never too good to lose, you're never too big to lose, you're never <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> to lose, it happens. And it happens when it needs to happen. And you have to embrace those things", she added.|$|E

2500|$|BevMo! employs Wilfred Wong, {{an expert}} taster and wine {{competition}} judge, who assigns bottles a wine rating {{based on his}} own version of Robert M. Parker, Jr.'s 50–100-point system. Wong, a veteran industry analyst and wine writer who has written regular columns for Vineyard & Winery Management magazine and Beverage Industry News, tastes some 8,000 bottles a year for BevMo!, and may taste 40 wines a day. A San Francisco native and resident who grew up working in his family's upscale grocery store in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, Wong was hired to work for BevMo! in 1995, when they had six stores. He told a New York Times reporter in 2006 that it can be tricky working as a wine critic inside a large retail chain that sells wine—there can be conflicts between appropriate scoring for a wine and business plans for that wine. He reported that he has, upon occasion, been encouraged by company management to give a high score to a wine, especially one that did not receive a high rating from other reviewers, or one that was purchased by BevMo! at a good price. Wong said, [...] "we have fights all the time." [...] Wong made assurances that he does not treat a wine to a good score based on company founders' wishes. Executive VP David Richards agrees: [...] "If we were to impinge on Wilfred's credibility, it would be very bad for our brand." [...] Wong reports only to Richards, to keep him from being influenced by wine sellers or BevMo!'s own buyers. Richards said, [...] "we have to give him independence within the organization." [...] Alder Yarrow, publisher of the wine blog Vinography.com, said of Wong, [...] "he is not a shill... He knows what he is talking about when it comes to wine." [...] Professor Emeritus Robert Smiley, Director of Wine Studies, Graduate School of Management, University of California, Davis, said about Wong's ratings: [...] "I {{think this is a good}} innovation and he's helpful to the consumer. It brings more people to BevMo and it probably moves them up in price because typically, the higher-price wines get the better scores." [...] Smiley said that shoppers were <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> to be fooled: [...] "If Wilfred and BevMo fix the ratings, people will catch on and go elsewhere." ...|$|E

50|$|In this much-anticipated prequel to Crown Duel, Vidanric Renselaeus, fifteen-year-old Marquis of Shevraeth, {{finds himself}} sent across the {{continent}} to a military academy in Marloven Hess, a kingdom known for its violent history. Vidanric is used to civilized life in pleasant Remalna—except that the evidence is increasingly clear that the civilization is only on the surface. <b>Too</b> many young, <b>smart</b> heirs have suffered accidents of late, and the evidence is beginning {{to point to the}} king, Galdran, who has grandiose plans for expansion.|$|R
60|$|Sciatica {{is a word}} {{employed}} much by Shakespeare in {{a certain}} connection. 'Tis true, he was no physician, but as I read, he had smarted in his day. I, <b>too,</b> do <b>smart.</b> And yet this keen soprano agony, these veins of fire and bombshell explosions in the knee, are as nothing to a certain dull, drowsy pain I had when my kidneys were congested at Nice; there was death in that; the creak of Charon's rowlocks, and the miasmas of the Styx. I may say plainly, much as I have lost the power of bearing pain, I had still rather suffer much than die. Not only the love of life grows on me, but the fear of certain odd end-seconds grows as well. 'Tis a suffocating business, take it how you will; and Tyrrel and Forest only bunglers.|$|R

I know that you are no niggard of your good things among your friends, {{and some of them are}} in much need of a slice. There, in my eye, is our friend Smellie; a man positively of the first abilities and greatest strength of mind, as well as one of the best hearts and keenest wits that I have ever met with; when you see him, as, alas! he <b>too</b> is <b>smarting</b> at the pinch of distressful circumstances, aggravated by the sneer of contumelious greatness--a bit of my cheese alone will not cure him, but if you add a tankard of brown stout, and superadd a magnum of bright Oporto, you will see his sorrows vanish like the morning mist before the summer sun.|$|R

I saw that I could never hit the Chambers with it, so I resigned in Marsh's favor, and he accomplished the task to my admiration.

50|$|In the {{beginning}} of his career, Roufus fought under the rule of Full contact where leg kicks, elbow strikes, and knee attacks were not allowed. He changed directions on 5 November 1988 when he challenged Changpuek Kiatsongrit in a non-title fight in Las Vegas. His kickboxing record stood at a perfect 28 wins, but the Thai proved to be <b>too</b> powerful and <b>smart.</b> Roufus knocked Changpuek down twice with punches in the first round, but lost by knockout in the fourth round due to the culmination of low kicks that he was unprepared for.|$|R
