500|$|As {{she struggles}} with her condition, doctors suggest to Karl that {{going back to}} {{familiar}} surroundings may trigger the return of her memories. Susan is brought to Ramsay Street, but nothing happens. Woodburne stated that Susan hates her hair and her clothes and wants to change everything. Karl takes her to Lyn Scully's salon and manages to persuade her to have her hair styled rather than cut short. While she is at the salon, Susan remembers her high school sweetheart, Craig Benson (Tim Hughes), and decides to find him. [...] Woodburne told Herbison [...] "As far as she's concerned, Craig is her boyfriend and they're in love. So she looks {{him up in the}} phone book and sets off to find him." [...] Woodburne added that there was a danger the storyline could cross a line and become silly, but the crew tried to portray the fear a person would feel when everything is suddenly unfamiliar. Susan falls in love with Karl and her memories return during their vow renewal service. During a 2012 interview, Woodburne told a What's on TV reporter that she and the writers initially joked about the storyline, but they found some truth in it. She explained [...] "It was actually based on a story of a woman who lived in England. The same thing happened to her. She fell over in a supermarket. Between leaving the supermarket and getting home, she'd lost 30 years. I don't think she recovered. She had a husband and grown-up children and she had no idea who they were. Imagine the terror and the fear of being surrounded by these people who <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are your family. But you feel nothing." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the time, Weber {{complained of}} both the control exerted by {{consolidated}} studios, {{as well as the}} ever more strenuous censorship of the Hays Code: [...] "I have received many offers, but in each case I'm hampered with too many conditions. ... The producers select the stories, select the cast, tell you how much you can pay for a picture and how long you can have to make it in. All this could be borne.

Or {{what is really going on}} in your partner's head when they say We need to talk or Do whatever you want ? And what about when your boss encourages you to think outside the square or <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> value your input ? Cliches are so much a part of our everyday communications that we rarely stop to think about the meaning behind the tumble of words. John Croucher grabs these expressions by the throat, shakes them about a bit, and then squeezes out the truth. With chapters on real estate, motor vehicles, law and order, business, retail, medicine and relationships, this is the perfect book for dipping into when you're looking for the truth - or a good chuckle. 175 page(s...|$|R

5000|$|James M. Honeycutt is a Distinguished Professor of Communication Studies at Louisiana State University at Baton Rouge, {{internationally known}} {{for his work in}} {{relationship}} scripts and daydreaming, particularly imagined interaction conflict-linkage theory which explains why it is hard to forget old arguments and relational scripts for the development and maintenance of interpersonal relationships. Instead, conflict may fester within the human mind as people imagine retribution {{that may or may not}} occur. One of the common attributes of imagined interactions is [...] "discrepancy" [...] where conversations that are imagined in the mind may be quite different from what actually happens in verbal discourse. For example, there is high discrepancy if <b>you</b> imagine <b>that</b> your boss will chastise you for being late in meeting a deadline; but then he/she <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> understand the delay because of other pending matters. Research has shown that discrepancy is associated with chronic loneliness and lack of satisfaction in interpersonal relationships.|$|R
