Athalie Range became a {{candidate}} for the vacant seat, the first African-American to run for the City Commission. She won a plurality in the primary election, although not a majority. In the runoff election, Range's opponent, a white man named Irwin Christie, sent a sound truck through white neighborhoods the day before the election broadcasting the message that if the white people did not get out and vote, they would have a black woman making laws for them. Athalie Range would later say, [...] "His campaign decided to play <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>card,</b> which took me out of contention." [...] Many black voters had been allowed to take time off from work to vote in the primary, but were not allowed to do so for the runoff. Range lost the runoff, receiving about 17,000 votes, while Christie received about 18,000. Christie later apologized to Range for the way he had run his campaign, and she accepted the apology.Dunn.

2500|$|The Queensland Labor Premier, Anna Bligh, {{described}} Andrews' {{criticism of}} Sudanese as [...] "disturbing".

During the controversy one criticism was that Andrews justified his decision based on [...] "concerns raised by the community", however no official report or inquest has been tendered, leading to the conclusion that any 'concerns' were both unofficial, undocumented and most probably belonging to a racially intolerant minority. The Howard government had before used <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>card</b> in an election year to distract the voters from its other failures. This was most significant in the 2001 election with the infamous Tampa affair, in which the government was badly trailing in the polls before vilifying middle-eastern [...] "boat people".

Andrews defended the system of having refugee quotas against the opinion expressed that intakes of refugees should be variated on the basis of global needs [...]" [...] In October 2007, Howard [...] "admitted breaking a promise to keep interest rates at record lows". During the 2004 campaign, Howard was also cited as giving the same promise, personally, on radio. Inflation figures released on 24 October indicated underlying inflation was higher than expected, which resulted in seven of eight financial companies believing there will be an interest rate rise when the reserve bank met in the middle of November, the first during an election campaign.|$|E
