5|$|A near-Earth {{supernova}} is {{a supernova}} {{close enough to}} the Earth to have noticeable effects on its biosphere. Depending upon the type and energy of the supernova, it could be as far as 3000light-years away. Gamma rays from a supernova would induce a chemical reaction in the upper atmosphere converting molecular nitrogen into nitrogen oxides, depleting the ozone layer enough <b>to</b> <b>expose</b> <b>the</b> surface to harmful ultraviolet solar radiation. This has been proposed as the cause of the Ordovician–Silurian extinction, which resulted in the death of nearly 60% of the oceanic life on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Despite having dark plumage in a {{tropical}} climate, frigatebirds have found ways not to overheat—particularly {{as they are}} exposed to full sunlight when on the nest. They ruffle feathers to lift them away from the skin and improve air circulation, and can extend and upturn their wings <b>to</b> <b>expose</b> <b>the</b> hot undersurface to the air and lose heat by evaporation and convection. Frigatebirds also place their heads in the shade of their wings, and males frequently flutter their gular pouches.|$|E

5|$|In {{her first}} year of service, Australia visited as many major Australian ports as {{possible}}, <b>to</b> <b>expose</b> <b>the</b> new navy to the widest possible audience and induce feelings of nationhood: naval historian David Stevens claims that these visits did more to break down state rivalries and promote the unity of Australia as a federated commonwealth than any other event. During late 1913, footage for the film Sea Dogs of Australia was filmed aboard the battlecruiser; the film was withdrawn almost immediately after first screening in August 1914 because of security concerns.|$|E
5|$|Most {{exploitation}} of oil shale involves mining followed by shipping elsewhere, after {{which one can}} burn the shale directly to generate electricity, or undertake further processing. The most common methods of surface mining involve open pit mining and strip mining. These procedures remove most of the overlying material <b>to</b> <b>expose</b> <b>the</b> deposits of oil shale, and become practical when the deposits occur near the surface. Underground mining of oil shale, which removes less of the overlying material, employs the room-and-pillar method.|$|E

5|$|Soft tissue reflection: An {{incision}} is {{made over}} the crest of bone, splitting the thicker attached gingiva roughly in half so that the final implant will have a thick band of tissue around it.

Flapless surgery is an alternate technique, where a small punch of tissue (the diameter of the implant) is removed for implant placement rather than raising flaps.|$|E

The trio are {{to drive to the}} Nuclear Plutonium Store, where isotopes for all Britain's power stations are housed, and plant explosives to detonate at 12:30p.m.; this will cause a nuclear explosion of unprecedented scale and devastate half of England. To ensure compliance, the charges, which have already been armed, are contained in wrist bracelets identical to Prescott's and are to be unlocked on retrieval of the key at the Plutonium Store.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of his}} {{endeavour}} <b>to</b> <b>expose</b> <b>the</b> {{public to}} more foreign-language works, Johnson facilitated the translation of educational texts, serious fiction, and philosophy (he was less interested in translating popular novels).

His publication of a translation of Constanin Volney's deistic Les Ruines, ou méditations sur les révolutions des empires (1791) quickly became a bestseller. Johnson also had some of the most prominent French children's literature translated, such as the works of Madame de Genlis.|$|E

5|$|Fruit bodies {{arise from}} the tips or the lateral {{branches}} or rhizomorphs. New fruit bodies are made of an exterior of thick hyphae {{similar to those found}} in the rhizomorph core; in contrast, the hyphae of the interior originate from the puffball's core. Unlike some other puffball species, the peridium does not differentiate into a distinct exoperidium and endoperidium; rather, the outer layer develops the features of a pseudoparenchyma (a tightly organised tissue where the tightly packed cells resemble plant parenchyma) as the radial and tangential hyphae become interweaved. In time, the peridium dries and falls off in flakes <b>to</b> <b>expose</b> <b>the</b> underlying gleba.|$|E
5|$|In most of {{the class}} Enopla ("armed"), the {{proboscis}} exits from a common orifice of the rhynchocoel and mouth. A typical member of this class has a stylet, a calcareous barb, with which the animal stabs the prey many times to inject toxins and digestive secretions. The prey is then swallowed whole or, after partial digestion, its tissues are sucked into the mouth. The stylet is attached about one-third of distance {{from the end of}} the ed proboscis, which extends only enough <b>to</b> <b>expose</b> <b>the</b> stylet. On either side of the active stylet are sacs containing back-up stylets to replace the active one as the animal grows or an active one is lost. Instead of one stylet, the Polystilifera have a pad that bears many tiny stylets, and these animals have separate orifices for the proboscis and mouth, unlike other Enopla. The Enopla can only attack after contacting the prey.|$|E
