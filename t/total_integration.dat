In March 1945 a Seabee battalion of 1,000 African-American men staged a hunger strike at their base, Naval Base Ventura County in Port Hueneme, California, in protest of discriminatory conditions. In the weeks following the latter incident, Fleet Admiral Ernest King and Secretary Forrestal worked with civilian expert Lester Granger on a plan for <b>total</b> <b>integration</b> of the races within the Navy.

5|$|On a {{surprise}} visit to Damascus {{to celebrate the}} union on 24 February, Nasser was welcomed by crowds {{in the hundreds of}} thousands. Crown Prince Imam Badr of North Yemen was dispatched to Damascus with proposals to include his country in the new republic. Nasser agreed to establish a loose federal union with Yemen—the United Arab States—in place of <b>total</b> <b>integration.</b> While Nasser was in Syria, King Saud planned to have him assassinated on his return flight to Cairo. On 4 March, Nasser addressed the masses in Damascus and waved before them the Saudi check given to Syrian security chief and, unbeknownst to the Saudis, ardent Nasser supporter Abdel Hamid Sarraj to shoot down Nasser's plane. As a consequence of Saud's plot, he was forced by senior members of the Saudi royal family to informally cede most of his powers to his brother, King Faisal, a major Nasser opponent who advocated pan-Islamic unity over pan-Arabism.|$|E
25|$|The building's most {{distinctive}} architectural {{feature is the}} fireplace, uncommon in office buildings, and the structure's only feature to incorporate Roman brick. The present-day structure consists of one open, interior space, while Wright's original design divided the building into two sections. One section was used as Smith's real estate office, the other as the bank. Wright also designed {{a full set of}} furniture for both offices, although much of it has been sold over the years. One of the pieces of Wright-designed furniture in the building was a round-backed chair. The chair was at least the second attempt at a round-backed chair by Wright; an earlier, more successful attempt was completed in the Darwin D. Martin House.

500|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of the Gleichschaltung policy pursued in these parts of occupied Europe was to destroy the very concepts of individual states and nationalities, just as {{the concept of a}} separate Austrian state and national identity was repressed after the Anschluss through the establishment of new state and party districts. The new empire was to no longer be a nation-state of the type that had emerged in the 19th century, but instead a [...] "racially pure community". It {{is for this reason that}} the German occupiers had no interest in transferring real power to the various far-right nationalist movements present in the occupied countries (such as Nasjonal Samling, the NSB, etc.) except for temporary reasons of Realpolitik, and instead actively supported radical collaborators who favored pan-Germanic unity (i.e. <b>total</b> <b>integration</b> to Germany) over provincial nationalism (for example DeVlag). Unlike Austria and the Sudetenland however, the process was to take considerably longer. Eventually these nationalities were to be merged with the Germans into a single ruling race, but Hitler stated that this prospect lay [...] "a hundred or so years" [...] in the future. During this interim period it was intended that the 'New Europe' would by run by Germans alone. According to Speer, while Himmler intended to eventually Germanize these peoples completely, Hitler intended not to [...] "infringe on their individuality" [...] (that is, their native languages), so that in the future they would [...] "add to the diversity and dynamism" [...] of his empire. The German language would be its lingua franca however, likening it to the status of English in the British Commonwealth.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{not exactly}} known how {{different}} languages are stored in the mind. A researcher, Vivian Cook, proposes that the languages are separated into distinct compartments. This is termed the separation model. An L2 speaker will speak one of the languages, but no connection is made between them in the mind (Cook 2003: 7). Another proposed model is the integration model, which suggests that rather than having two separate mental lexicons, an L2 speaker has one lexicon where words from one language are stored from one language alongside words from the other. Regarding phonology, {{it has been found}} that L2 speakers sometimes have one merged system for producing speech, not distinguished by L1 or L2. The integration model focuses on how there is a balance between the unique elements of both languages, and how they form one system. Though these two proposed models offering interesting perspectives, it is impossible to have total separation because both languages exist in the same mind. <b>Total</b> <b>integration</b> is impossible because we are able to keep the languages apart in our minds (Cook 2003: 7). Another proposed model is the link language model. This model illustrates the idea that two languages within the same mind are able to influence and interact with one another. Further, the partial integration model illustrates the idea of partial overlapping between two languages in one mind. It doesn't differentiate between the languages in the overlap, but it shows how it functions as a single, conjoined system. These systems illustrate the point that vocabulary, syntax, and other aspects of language knowledge can be shared or overlapped between different languages within one mind (Cook 2003: 8). Finally, all of the models function together to create the integration continuum, an illustration that shows the possible relationships in [...] "multi-competence" [...] (Cook 2003: 9).|$|E
