5|$|There {{are several}} defences to {{trespass}} to land; licence, justification by law, necessity and jus tertii. Licence is express or implied permission, {{given by the}} possessor of land, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> land. If a licence is lawfully revoked, a licence-holder becomes a trespasser if they remain on the land. Justification by law refers to those situations {{in which there is}} statutory authority permitting a person to go onto land, such as the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which allows the police to enter land for the purposes of carrying out an arrest. Jus tertii is where the defendant can prove that the land is not possessed by the claimant, but by a third party, as in Doe d Carter v Barnard. The exception to this defence is if the claimant is a tenant and the defendant a landlord who had no right to give the claimant his lease. Necessity is the situation in which it is vital to commit the trespass; in Esso Petroleum Co v Southport Corporation, the captain of a ship committed trespass by allowing oil to flood a shoreline. This was necessary to protect his ship and crew, however, and the defence of necessity was accepted.|$|E
25|$|Juan García Ábrego's {{business}} {{had grown to}} such length that the FBI placed him on the Top Ten Most Wanted in 1995. He was the first drug trafficker <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> list. On 14 January 1996, García Ábrego was arrested outside a ranch in Monterrey, Nuevo León. He was quickly extradited to the United States where he stood trial eight months after his arrest. García Ábrego was convicted for 22 counts of money laundering, drug possession and drug trafficking. Jurors also ordered the seizure of $350 million of García Ábrego’s assets— $75 million more than what was previously planned. Juan García Ábrego is currently serving 11 life terms in a maximum security prison in Colorado, U.S. In 1996, it was disclosed that García Ábrego's organization paid {{millions of dollars in}} bribes to politicians and law enforcement officers for his protection. It was later proven after his arrest that the deputy attorney general in charge of Mexico's federal Judicial Police had accumulated more than $9 million US dollars for protecting García Ábrego.|$|E
500|$|You {{know how}} many verses I did for that song. I did a version of that before her album [...] even came out. I did two verses. I love these verses too, but they ended up going with André's verse and André killed it. [...] Then [...] reached out to me and {{she wanted me to}} get on the remix. I did two more verses. Out of the second set that I did, she picked the first verse. But my second verse, I just gotta say for the record… It was just too long, I think she was looking for {{something}} shorter and more to the point. [...] It's just a blessing to even be able to work with [...] I'm on my defensive rapper, like yo man. When you follow in André's 3000's shoes, you're expected to really go in. Just the fact to even be on the song with her and shoot the video with her and just be in her presence. She's such a hard working, incredible artist. I’ll never forget that day we shot the video, I'll never forget being able <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> song, and hopefully we got more as time goes on[...]|$|E

Instead of their names being George, he called everybody by their first name. He always had like a piano in the car and they sang and danced and had a great time. He was just a fun person to be around." ...|$|E

It placed at number 9, its highest position so far. After another 4 weeks, the song reached an even higher position, jumping from number 27 to number 3. In March 2011, the single spent its 52nd week at number 49 on the German Singles Chart, making it her first single <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> chart for one year or longer, and the 41st single in general to do so.

2500|$|The {{title track}} [...] "Vice Verses" [...] was first {{performed}} by Jon Foreman at an acoustic benefit show on April 12, 2009.

I think it's the title of the next one." [...] On April 23, 2009, Switchfoot officially announced via Twitter that the album that would release following Hello Hurricane would be titled Vice Verses. This announcement came on the heels of a Twitter post in which the band said they had recorded four albums' worth of material during the Hurricane sessions and intended to release the records one by one. This plan was short-lived, however, with Foreman later stating that the band had [...] "already replaced a lot the songs on Vice Verses with new songs" [...] and that Vice Verses [...] was a departure from Hello Hurricane.|$|E
2500|$|Things {{changed for}} O'Brien in 1991, when in quick succession, an {{engagement}} fell through; Lookwell was not picked up; and, burned out, he quit Saturday Night Live. [...] "I told Lorne Michaels I couldn't {{come back to}} work and I just needed to do something else," [...] O'Brien recalled. [...] "I had no plan whatsoever. I was literally in this big transition phase in my life where I decided, I'll just walk around New York City, and an idea will come to me." [...] Mike Reiss and Al Jean, then dual showrunners of The Simpsons, called O'Brien and offered him a job. The series was notorious in the writing community at the time; O'Brien recalls [...] "everyone wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> show, but they never hired." [...] O'Brien {{was one of the first}} hires after the show's original crew. With the help of old Groundlings friend Lisa Kudrow, O'Brien purchased an apartment in Beverly Hills. He and Kudrow became involved as well, and Kudrow believed he should begin performing rather than writing. O'Brien disagreed, feeling that Kudrow was being overly flattering and that asserting he was happy as a writer. In his speech given at Class Day at Harvard in 2000, O'Brien credited The Simpsons with saving him, a reference to the career slump he was experiencing prior to his being hired for the show.|$|E
