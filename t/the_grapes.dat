5|$|Cremisan Wine, {{founded in}} 1885, is a winery run by monks in the Monastery of Cremisan. <b>The</b> <b>grapes</b> are grown {{mainly in the}} al-Khader district. In 2007, the monastery's wine {{production}} was around 700,000liters per year.|$|E
5|$|The first {{batches of}} vinegar {{produced}} by fermentation probably followed {{errors in the}} winemaking process. If must is fermented at too high a temperature, acetobacter will overwhelm the yeast naturally occurring on <b>the</b> <b>grapes.</b> As the demand for vinegar for culinary, medical, and sanitary purposes increased, vintners quickly learned to use other organic materials to produce vinegar in the hot summer months before <b>the</b> <b>grapes</b> were ripe and ready for processing into wine. This method was slow, however, and not always successful, as the vintners {{did not understand the}} process.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>grape</b> shares some {{morphological}} similarities with <b>the</b> Savoy wine <b>grape</b> Altesse and {{has been}} historically confused with <b>the</b> French wine <b>grape</b> variety. In Hungary, Furmint is sometimes confused with Kéknyelű while {{on the island of}} Korčula, in Croatia, <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> has been confused with Pošip. <b>The</b> Romanian wine <b>grape</b> Grasă de Cotnari and <b>the</b> Bosnian wine <b>grape</b> Žilavka also shares several synonyms with Furmint and are, thusly, often confused with <b>the</b> <b>grape.</b>|$|R
5|$|Families {{living in}} the area harvest <b>the</b> <b>grapes</b> {{in the spring and}} summer to produce a variety of {{products}} ranging from raisins, jams and a molasses known as dibs. The Bethlehem area, Beit Jala in particular, and the village of Jifna are known regionally for their apricots and apricot jam as is the Tulkarm area for its olives and olive oil.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>grapes</b> exhibit {{an uneven}} pattern of ripening: a single bunch may contain both raisin-like, {{over-ripe}} grapes and green, unripened grapes. Some winemakers choose to vinify the bunches with these {{varying levels of}} ripeness, while others hand-harvest the bunches, even by single berries, in multiple passes through the vineyards over several weeks. This extensively laborious practice is one component in {{the high cost of}} some Zinfandels.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>grapes</b> {{typically}} {{produce a}} robust red wine, {{although in the}} United States a semi-sweet rosé (blush-style) wine called White Zinfandel has six times as many sales as the red wine. The grape's high sugar content can be fermented into levels of alcohol exceeding 15 percent.|$|E
50|$|In Friuli, Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso vines {{are planted}} in both {{hillside}} and level terrain. Ripening {{is a concern}} and <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> requires sufficient access to warmth and sunlight, which {{play a major role}} in deciding where to plant <b>the</b> <b>grape.</b> Despite being a slow ripener, <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> does have good resistance to rot that can develop during autumn rains. The deeply colored wine produced from <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> tends to be full-bodied with high acidity levels and flavors of plum & almond notes. Since the renewed interest in <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> of <b>the</b> 1980s, winemakers have experimented with producing more internationally recognizable styles of <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> with techniques like malolactic fermentation and new oak aging to mix results.|$|R
50|$|There is {{confusion}} about <b>the</b> <b>grape's</b> exact origins with some wine experts describing <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> as being indigenous to Corsica while other theories report that <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> is of Italian origins {{and possibly even}} a genetically identical clone of <b>the</b> Tuscan wine <b>grape</b> Sangiovese that came to Corsica from Genoa.|$|R

5|$|The {{style of}} Cabernet Sauvignon is {{strongly}} influenced by the ripeness of <b>the</b> <b>grapes</b> at harvest. When more on the unripe side, <b>the</b> <b>grapes</b> are high in pyrazines and will exhibit pronounced green bell peppers and vegetal flavors. When harvested overripe the wines can taste jammy and may have aromas of stewed blackcurrants. Some winemakers choose to harvest their grapes at different ripeness levels in order to incorporate these different elements and potentially add some layer of complexity to the wine. When Cabernet Sauvignon is young, the wines typically exhibit strong fruit flavors of black cherries and plum. The aroma of blackcurrants {{is one of the}} most distinctive and characteristic element of Cabernet Sauvignon that is present in virtually every style of the wine across the globe. Styles from various regions and producers may also have aromas of eucalyptus, mint and tobacco. As the wines age they can sometimes develop aromas associated with cedar, cigar boxes and pencil shavings. In general New World examples have more pronounced fruity notes while Old World wines can be more austere with heightened earthy notes.|$|E
5|$|The {{taste of}} the red wine depends on the {{ripeness}} of <b>the</b> <b>grapes</b> from which it is made. Red berry fruit flavors like raspberry predominate in wines from cooler areas, whereas blackberry, anise and pepper notes are more common in wines made in warmer areas and in wines made from the earlier-ripening Primitivo clone.|$|E
5|$|When {{vineyards}} in the south-west Cape started letting weeds grow between vines {{to conserve}} moisture, around 1956, the Cape sparrow moved in. Cape sparrows quickly exhausted {{the seeds and}} started eating <b>the</b> <b>grapes.</b> The Cape sparrow is now a serious pest in vineyards. However, vineyards are not optimal habitat: some populations have had such a low reproductive success {{that they could not}} be maintained without immigration.|$|E
50|$|The exact {{origins of}} <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> are unknown, with early wine texts speculating that <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> may have {{originated}} in Spain. Today most ampelographers believe that <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> is indigenous to southern Italy, with Apulia {{believed to be}} the most likely home of <b>the</b> <b>grape.</b> In <b>the</b> 20th century DNA profiling has shown that while Bombino bianco is closely related to Bombino nero, <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> is not color mutation but its own distinct variety. Though Bombino bianco shares many synonyms with Trebbiano Toscano (also known as Ugni blanc), <b>the</b> two <b>grapes</b> are unrelated. DNA research has also shown that Bombino bianco {{may be one of the}} parent varieties of <b>the</b> Impigno <b>grape</b> of <b>the</b> Ostuni DOC in Apulia andof <b>the</b> Moscatello Selvatico <b>grape</b> that is also native to the same region.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>grape</b> has a {{tendency}} to ripen late, with harvests as late as November in some parts of southern Italy. If <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> is picked too early, or with excessive yields, <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> can be aggressively tannic. The vine seems to thrive in particularly volcanic soils.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>grape</b> {{was long}} {{believed}} to a dark-berried color mutation of Vermentino though some ampelographers believe that <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> may have Spanish origins and {{be related to}} Monastrell (known as Mourvèdre in France) or <b>the</b> Aragonese <b>grape</b> Parraleta used in the wines of Somontano. As of 2012, DNA profiling on <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> variety {{has not been able}} to confirm or deny either theory.|$|R
5|$|A {{significant}} portion of reviews drew parallels between Carnivàle and David Lynch's 1990s mystery TV series Twin Peaks, a show in which Carnivàle actor Michael J. Anderson had previously appeared. Knauf did not deny a stylistic link and made comparisons to John Steinbeck's novel <b>The</b> <b>Grapes</b> of Wrath. When Lost began to receive major critical attention, Carnivàle and its type of mythological storytelling were compared to Lost story approach in several instances.|$|E
5|$|In the Sauternes region, {{the grape}} is blended with Sémillon {{to make the}} late harvest wine, Sauternes. The {{composition}} of Sauvignon blanc varies from producer and can range from 5-50% with the Premier Cru Supérieur Château d'Yquem using 20%. A traditional practice often employed in Sauternes is to plant one Sauvignon Blanc vine at regular intervals among rows of Sémillon. However, Sauvignon blanc's propensity to ripen 1–2 weeks earlier can lead <b>the</b> <b>grapes</b> to lose some of their intensity and aroma as they hang longer on the vine. This has prompted more producers to isolate their parcels of Sauvignon blanc.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, ampelographers began to {{distinguish}} Sauvignon blanc from Sauvignonasse plantings in Chile. The character of non-blended Chilean Sauvignon blanc are noticeably less acidic than the wines of New Zealand and {{more similar to}} the French style that is typical of Chilean wines. The region of Valparaíso is the most notable area for Sauvignon blanc in Chile due to its cooler climate which allows <b>the</b> <b>grapes</b> {{to be picked up}} to six weeks later than in other parts of Chile. In Brazil, ampelographers have discovered that the vines called Sauvignon blanc planted in the region are really Seyval blanc.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>grape</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in 1760 by the Italian writer and traveler Domenico Sestini as {{growing in the}} foothills of Mount Etna where ampelographers believe that <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> originated from. <b>The</b> <b>grape's</b> name, Minella, is derived from the Sicilian minna which means breast and refers to the berries' shape.|$|R

25|$|Other {{theories}} for Furmint's origin note <b>the</b> <b>grape's</b> {{similarities to}} <b>the</b> Savoy wine <b>grape</b> Altesse and speculate that <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> may have originated there {{or even in}} Byzantium where, according to legend, Altesse was brought back to Savoy in 1367 by Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy. The Syrmia region with Serbia has also been listed as one potential birthplace for <b>the</b> <b>grape.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Sauvignon blanc vine often buds late but ripens early, {{which allows}} it to perform well in sunny climates when not exposed to {{overwhelming}} heat. In warm regions such as South Africa, Australia and California, the grape flourishes in cooler climate appellations such as the Alexander Valley area. In areas where the vine is subjected to high heat, the grape will quickly become over-ripe and produce wines with dull flavors and flat acidity. Rising global temperatures have caused farmers to harvest <b>the</b> <b>grapes</b> earlier {{than they have in}} the past.|$|E
5|$|The best decade for January movies, Burr writes, {{may well}} have been the 1940s. It began with what he {{suggests}} was best January in cinema history. <b>The</b> <b>Grapes</b> of Wrath, His Girl Friday and The Shop Around the Corner, all considered classics, were released in January 1940. Later in the decade, other classic films would first reach screens during January, such as Sullivan's Travels, Shadow of a Doubt and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.|$|E
5|$|The {{story was}} {{inspired}} by Florey's own experiences in Hollywood, {{as well as the}} George Gershwin composition Rhapsody in Blue. It {{was one of the first}} films shot by Gregg Toland, who later received acclaim for his work on such films as <b>The</b> <b>Grapes</b> of Wrath (1939) and Citizen Kane (1941). The film serves as a satire of the social conditions, dominant practices, and ideologies of Hollywood, as well as the film industry's perceived mistreatment of actors. Douglas Fairbanks assisted with the development of the film, and Charlie Chaplin and Joseph M. Schenck helped promote it.|$|E
50|$|Raisins are {{produced}} commercially by drying harvested grape berries. For a grape berry to dry, water inside <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> {{must be removed}} completely from {{the interior of the}} cells onto the surface of <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> where <b>the</b> water droplets can evaporate. However, this diffusion process is very difficult because <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> skin contains wax in its cuticle, which prevents the water from passing through. In addition to this, the physical and chemical mechanisms located on the outer layers of <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> are adapted to prevent water loss.|$|R
25|$|The small {{berries and}} thick skins of <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> {{contribute}} to high phenolic levels of Agiorgitiko which leads the wine needing very little maceration {{time in order}} to extract the deep, dark color associated with <b>the</b> <b>grape.</b> It also contribute to the tannin levels and <b>the</b> <b>grape's</b> ability to handle the effects of oak aging in the barrel.|$|R

5|$|Winemakers in New Zealand and Chile harvest <b>the</b> <b>grapes</b> {{at various}} {{intervals}} {{for the different}} blending characteristics that the grape can impart depending on its ripeness levels. At its most unripe stage, the grape is high in malic acid. As it progresses further towards ripeness the grape develops red & green pepper flavors and eventually achieves a balance of sugars. The flavors characteristic of Sauvignon blanc come from the chemicals methoxypyrazines. Grapes grown in Marlborough's Wairau Valley may exhibit different levels of ripeness over the vineyard, caused by slight unevenness in the land and giving a similar flavor profile to the resulting wine.|$|E
5|$|Zinfandel vines {{are quite}} {{vigorous}} and grow best in climates that are warm {{but not too}} hot, because grapes may shrivel in hot weather. Zinfandel's thin-skinned grapes grow in large, tight bunches that are sometimes prone to bunch rot. The fruit ripen fairly early and produce juice with high sugar content. If weather conditions permit, <b>the</b> <b>grapes</b> may be late-harvested to make dessert wine. Zinfandel is often praised {{for its ability to}} reflect both its terroir and its winemaker's style and skill.|$|E
5|$|A specimen-collecting {{expedition}} {{along the}} Pacific Coast {{and down into}} Mexico provided them {{with a chance to}} relax, and, for Steinbeck, a chance for a brief escape from the controversy mounting around <b>The</b> <b>Grapes</b> of Wrath. Ricketts, suffering {{as a result of the}} breakup of his long-term relationship with a married woman in Monterey, was glad to get away too. They planned to collect specimens from the rock and tide pools and the shore line uncovered between tides which would allow them build up a picture of the macro level ecosystem in the Gulf. The preserved specimens of the fauna they collected could be identified and catalogued or sold on their return.|$|E
