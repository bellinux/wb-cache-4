5|$|In October 2014, Twitter {{announced}} Fabric, a {{suite of}} mobile developer tools built around Crashlytics. Fabric brought together Crashlytics, Answers (mobile app analytics), Beta (mobile app distribution), Digits (mobile app identity and authentication services), MoPub, and TwitterKit (login with Twitter and Tweet display functionality) into a single, modular SDK, allowing developers <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> choose which features they needed while guaranteeing ease of installation and compatibility. By building Fabric on top of Crashlytics, Twitter {{was able to take}} advantage of Crashlytics' large adoption and device footprint to rapidly scale usage of MoPub and TwitterKit. Fabric reached active distribution across 1 billion mobile devices just 8 months after its launch.|$|E
5|$|On 19 February, Hausser's SS Panzer Corps {{was ordered}} to strike southwards, to provide a screen for the 4th Panzer Army's attack. Simultaneously, Army Detachment Hollidt {{was ordered to}} contain the {{continuing}} Soviet efforts to break through German lines. The 1st Panzer Army was ordered to drive north {{in an attempt to}} cut off and destroy Popov's Mobile Group, using accurate intelligence on Soviet strength which allowed the Wehrmacht <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> choose their engagements and bring about tactical numerical superiority. The 1st and 4th Panzer Armies were also ordered to attack the overextended Soviet 6th Army and 1st Guards Army. Between 20–23 February, the 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH) cut through the 6th Army's flank, eliminating the Soviet threat to the Dnieper River and successfully surrounding and destroying a number of Red Army units south of the Samara River. The 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich advanced in a northeastern direction, while the 3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf was put into action on 22 February, advancing parallel to the Das Reich. These two divisions successfully cut the supply lines to the Soviet spearheads. First Panzer Army was able to surround and pocket Popov's Mobile Group by 24 February, although a sizable contingent of Soviet troops managed to escape north. On 22 February, alarmed by the success of the German counterattack, the Soviet Stavka ordered the Voronezh Front to shift the 3rd Tank Army and 69th Army south, in an effort to alleviate pressure on the Southwestern Front and destroy German forces in the Krasnograd area.|$|E
25|$|Hirwani's debut was in {{the final}} Test of the series at Madras. The wicket was underprepared. India won an {{important}} toss and made 382. Hirwani took {{three of the five}} West Indian wickets to fall on the second day. On the third morning, Hirwani clean-bowled Vivian Richards with a googly which the batsman failed <b>to</b> <b>pick,</b> <b>and</b> dismissed the remaining four batsmen to finish with 8 for 61. This made him only the fourth bowler to take eight wickets in an innings on debut.|$|E

25|$|This is a {{book that}} contradicts itself a hundred times; {{but that is not}} a {{criticism}} of it, because its author thinks contradictions are a sign of intellectual ferment and vitality. This {{is a book}} that systematically distorts and selects historical evidence; but that is not a criticism, because its author thinks that all interpretations are biased, and she regards it as her duty <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> choose her facts to favor her own brand of politics. This is a book full of vaporous, French-intellectual prose that makes Teilhard de Chardin sound like Ernest Hemingway by comparison; but that is not a criticism, because the author likes that sort of prose and has taken lessons in how to write it, and she thinks that plain, homely speech is part of a conspiracy to oppress the poor.|$|E
25|$|Rise Up (Colors of Peace) was {{a musical}} project to turn Gülen's poems and {{writings}} in Turkish language into songs. A selection {{had already been}} published as English language translations under the title Broken Plectrum. A total of 50 poems were sent to various Muslim and non-Muslim artists from various countries, who were free <b>to</b> <b>pick,</b> <b>and</b> then compose and vocalize the poem chosen, record it {{in their own country}} and send it back for inclusion in the planned album. Reportedly, no restrictions were put on the artists in using instrumentation, despite reservations by stricter Muslim interpretations about music and use of musical instruments. The album Rise Up (Colors of Peace) turned into an album of world music encompassing various genres like jazz, pop, flamenco, rai, Indian music among others. The artists appearing (in order of appearance on the track list) were: The Good Morning Diary, Maher Zain, Faudel, Cristelo Duo featuring Bruno Gouveia, Ryan Shaw, Natacha Atlas, Bon Bon, KK & Reet, Mazachigno featuring Ely Bruna, Bahroma, Carmen Paris, Kobi Farhi & Ruba Shamshoum. The project took more than two years to realize and the album was released in 2013 by Nil Production and Universal Music.|$|E

500|$|Ramirez {{talked about}} how the second season would be {{different}} from the first, saying that the writers had spent the first season wondering [...] "if there was a place for dark and gritty content in superheroes" [...] and because of the positive fan reaction to that ("we got a loud answer of 'yes'"), approached the second season with the mindset, [...] "you wanted grounded and wanted dark, here’s Elektra and Punisher. You asked for it." [...] Petrie, talking about the potential use of flashbacks in the season, said that sometimes it is best to [...] "peel back the layer of the onion through flashback, or two people in a room talking can have all the power in the world.

500|$|Director David Silverman {{said that}} unlike the TV series where [...] "you [...] <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> choose", the film {{gave them the}} {{opportunity}} to [...] "lavish that attention [...] every single scene". The characters have shadows, unlike in the show. Silverman and the animators looked to films such as The Incredibles, The Triplets of Belleville, and Bad Day at Black Rock for inspiration, as they were [...] "a great education in staging because of how the characters are placed". They also looked for ideas for a dream sequence, in Disney films such as Dumbo and the Pluto cartoon Pluto's Judgment Day, and for crowd scenes in It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. Silverman looked at some of the Simpsons episodes he had directed, primarily his two favorites, [...] "Homie the Clown" [...] and [...] "Three Men and a Comic Book". Mike B. Anderson, Lauren MacMullan, Rich Moore, and Steven Dean Moore each directed the animation for around a quarter of the film under Silverman's supervision, with numerous other animators working on scenes.|$|E
500|$|As well as {{the scale}} of the response, critics {{questioned}} the criteria against which patients were selected for evacuation. At first the UK was challenged over its decision to include only children in the transports while tens of thousands of adults remained wounded in the city. Sylvana Foa, spokesperson for the UNHCR, commented that Sarajevo should not be regarded as a [...] "supermarket" [...] of photogenic potential refugees, asking [...] "Does this mean Britain only wants to help children? Maybe it only wants children under six, or blond children, or blue-eyed children?" [...] Patrick Peillod, head of the United Nations medical evacuation committee, said that the UK had treated Bosnian children [...] "like animals in a zoo" [...] and was trying <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> choose evacuees to suit a public relations agenda. When the government revised its approach and included adults on flights out of the city, claims were made that wounded combatants had been among those taken to the UK, Sweden, and Italy, and that patients had paid bribes {{to be included in the}} transports.|$|E

They also described her as having a [...] "warm heart" [...] and being [...] "family oriented". Charlie can be [...] "misunderstood" [...] at times, which makes her appear brash. On her character, Anderson said, [...] "Charlie is strong-willed with lots of guts and she is never afraid to show who she is, which makes her genuine and likeable". Whilst interviewed by the Llanelli Star, Anderson described Charlie's responsibilities stating: [...] "Charlie is very passionate about her work. She cares about Ruby more than life itself and is responsible for her, so these are priorities over a finding a man. I don't think it's a matter of need for her but she definitely would like someone to share her life with and that romantic element is a good balance in Charlie's somewhat serious life." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1954 Holloway {{joined the}} Old Vic theatre company to play Bottom in A Midsummer Night's Dream, with Robert Helpmann as Oberon and Moira Shearer as Titania. After {{playing at the}} Edinburgh Festival, the Royal Shakespeare Company took the {{production}} to New York, where it played at the Metropolitan Opera House and then on tour of the US and Canada. The production was harshly reviewed by critics {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic, but Holloway made a strong impression. [...] Holloway said of the experience: [...] "Out of the blue I was asked by the Royal Shakespeare Company to tour America with them, playing Bottom. ... From that American tour came the part of Alfred Doolittle in My Fair Lady and from then on, well, just let's say I was able <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> choose my parts and that was very pleasant at my age." [...] Holloway's film career continued simultaneously with his stage work; one example was the 1956 comedy Jumping for Joy. [...] American audiences became familiar with his earlier film roles when the films began to be broadcast on television in the 1950s.|$|E
500|$|Crackdown was {{critically}} acclaimed by game critics who praised the open-world approach. [...] Reviewers commented highly on the graphics of the game, both in its detailed city and large draw distances, and the cel-like shading of the characters; 1UP said that [...] "it's just better {{to let a}} game approach reality on its own aesthetic terms than to go hyperrealistic". X-Play stated, [...] "It's an absolute blast to play, and arguably {{one of the finest}} superhero games made thus far", and IGN stated, [...] "Overall the thrill of jumping like a mutant kangaroo from rooftop to rooftop is unrivaled!" [...] The co-op play feature over Xbox Live was well received; Eurogamer wrote, [...] "Being able <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> leap into any of your friends' or even complete strangers' cities is likely to keep that buzz going though", and 1UP agreed, remarking [...] "That it represents the best, if not the first, online multiplayer sandbox game on a console is just gravy". Reviews did critique the lack of any appreciable story within the game, and how short the core game itself may be; IGN argued [...] "Crackdown won't last that long, it's uneven, and the story and the music are weak sauce".|$|E

500|$|Davis gained {{international}} attention after her refusal to issue marriage licenses {{and the ensuing}} controversy her actions caused. Many legal experts asserted that Davis had no standing under the law to refuse to issue the licenses. Columbia Law School professor Katherine Franke said, [...] "Kim Davis has all sorts of religious liberty rights secured under the First Amendment and under other laws, {{but they are not}} at stake in this case. All she's asked to do with couples that come before her is certify that they've met the state requirements for marriage, so her religious opposition to same-sex marriage is absolutely irrelevant." [...] Professor Stephen Vladeck of American University's Washington College of Law said that Davis [...] "waived any right to have an objection to issuing same-sex marriage licenses when she ran for the job". Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin and others compared Davis' refusal to follow orders of the U.S. Supreme Court to Alabama Governor George Wallace's futile [...] "Stand in the Schoolhouse Door" [...] protest of desegregation in 1963. The Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT civil rights group, said, [...] "Ms. Davis has the fundamental right to believe what she likes... but as a public servant, she does not have the right <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> choose which laws she will follow or which services she will provide." [...] Attorney and author Roberta A. Kaplan, who argued for the plaintiffs in United States v. Windsor, wrote that [...] "Kim Davis is the clearest example of someone who wants to use a religious liberty argument to discriminate, yet she swore an oath to uphold the Constitution. It is laughable that she can then decide which laws to enforce, which is why every decision in her case has gone against her." ...|$|E
