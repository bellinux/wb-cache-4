40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the in vitro and in vivo function of hepatocytes after immortalization, cryopreservation, encapsulation, and xenotransplantation into mice with fulminant liver failure (FLF). METHODS: Rat and human hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion. Human hepatocytes were immortalized using lentiviral vectors. Rat and immortalized human hepatocytes (IHH) were encapsulated in 400 microm of alginate-poly-L-lysine (PLL; Sigma, Buchs, Switzerland) -alginate membranes and cryopreserved using a computerized device. In vitro, encapsulated hepatocytes (cryopreserved or noncryopreserved) were cultured; albumin secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Microencapsulated (cryopreserved or noncryopreserved) hepatocytes were transplanted intraperitoneally to mice with FLF: group 1 (n = 10) <b>transplantation</b> <b>of</b> empty capsules; group 2 (n = 12) <b>transplantation</b> <b>of</b> free primary rat hepatocytes; group 3 (n = 12) <b>transplantation</b> <b>of</b> cryopreserved encapsulated rat hepatocytes; group 4 (n = 10) <b>transplantation</b> <b>of</b> encapsulated rat hepatocytes; group 5 (n = 9) <b>transplantation</b> <b>of</b> cryopreserved encapsulated IHH; group 6 (n = 10) <b>transplantation</b> <b>of</b> encapsulated IHH. RESULTS: Compared with free primary hepatocytes, cryopreserved or noncryopreserved encapsulated rodent hepatocytes showed similar levels of continuous in vitro albumin secretion over 1 week. Cryopreserved or noncryopreserved encapsulated IHH showed minimal albumin secretion compared with free primary human hepatocytes. Fulminant liver failure, produced by a combination of acetaminophen and 30 % hepatectomy, resulted in a 20 % to 30 % host survival. In groups 1 and 2, survival was unmodified, compared with untreated mice. For groups 3 and 4, <b>transplantation</b> <b>of</b> cryopreserved or noncryopreserved encapsulated rat hepatocytes significantly increased survival rates to 66 % and 80 %, respectively (P <. 01). For groups 5 and 6, <b>transplantation</b> <b>of</b> cryopreserved or noncryopreserved encapsulated IHH improved host survival to 50 % and 55 %, respectively (P <. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Primary rodent hepatocytes maintained synthetic functions after encapsulation and cryopreservation. Immortalized human hepatocytes showed minimal albumin secretion in the absence of encapsulation and cryopreservation, suggesting that hepatocytes lose some specific functions after immortalization. After induction of FLF in mice, intraperitoneal <b>transplantation</b> <b>of</b> encapsulated (primary or immortalized, cryopreserved or noncryopreserved) xenogeneic hepatocytes significantly improved survival. These results indicate that naive and genetically modified hepatocytes can be successfully encapsulated, stored by cryopreservation, and transplanted into xenogeneic recipients with FLF to sustain liver metabolic functions...|$|R

40|$|The {{transplant}} experiments {{described in}} this work may help to shorten the generation interval for long maturing endangered fish species and their more effective reproduction. Further, {{it is possible to}} preserve the separated spermatogonia and oogonia using a cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen. We conserve both paternal and maternal DNA and the gene pool <b>of</b> endangered <b>fish</b> species will not be depleted of maternal part. It's because we can freeze only sperm in the preservation <b>of</b> mature gametes. <b>Fish</b> eggs and embryos would not survive freezing. The described methods will be applied in the future to more effective rescue of critically endangered sturgeons by the <b>transplantation</b> <b>of</b> their germ cells into a Sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus). These methods can be suitable for application on other species <b>of</b> endangered <b>fish</b> in case <b>of</b> finding an appropriate recipient. As an example <b>of</b> our <b>fish</b> species is a European eel (Anguilla Anguilla). The Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baeri) and the Sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus) were used as model organisms. For Siberian sturgeon the enzymatic dissociation technique, sorting of germ cells using Percoll gradient concentration and <b>transplantation</b> <b>of</b> sturgeon spermatogonia and oogonia were used. The results showed that the use of 0. 3 % of trypsin in PBS is optimal for dissociation of spermatogonia and oogonia, because this medium was dissociating the highest number of cells without reducing their viability. The separation of the early stages of germ cells has been successfully achieved by segregation in 10 to 30 % of Percoll gradient with the help <b>of</b> centrifugation.

In vitro experiments showed that different combinations of microencapsulated rat's hepatocytes and stromal cells survive, grow, and function better in three-dimensional conditions. The metabolic activity of rat hepatocytes co-microencapsulated with hFLSCs, particularly when engineered to produce bFGF (FLSCs/bFGF), is significantly higher than that of microcapsules with rat hepatocytes alone. Intraperitoneal <b>transplantation</b> <b>of</b> the encapsulated hepatocytes with FLSCs/bFGF increased the survival rate and improved liver function of an ALF mouse model induced by a 70 % partial hepatectomy in BALB/C mice. Moreover, dramatic liver regeneration was observed 2 days after transplantation in the group that received intraperitoneal <b>transplantations</b> <b>of</b> encapsulated hepatocytes with FLSCs/bFGF. Therefore, <b>transplantation</b> <b>of</b> encapsulated hepatocytes and hFLSCs/bFGF may be a promising strategy to treat ALF or related liver diseases...|$|R
