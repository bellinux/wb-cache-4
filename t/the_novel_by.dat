5|$|Kurosawa's next film, for Shochiku, was The Idiot, an {{adaptation}} of <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>by</b> the director's favorite writer, Fyodor Dostoyevsky.

It is widely considered today {{to be one of}} the director's least successful works. Contemporary reviews were very negative, but the film was a moderate success at the box office, largely because of the popularity of one of its stars, Setsuko Hara.|$|E
