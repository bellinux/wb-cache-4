40|$|This paper {{presents}} the mechanical and microstructural {{characteristics of a}} lightweight aggregate geopolymer concrete (LWAGC) synthesized by the alkali-activation of a fly ash source (FA) before and after being exposed <b>to</b> <b>elevated</b> temperatures, ranging from 100 to 800 °C. The {{results show that the}} LWAGC unexposed <b>to</b> the <b>elevated</b> temperatures possesses a good strength-to-weight ratio compared with other LWAGCs available in the published literature. The unexposed LWAGC also shows an excellent strength development versus aging times, up to 365 days. For the exposed LWAGC <b>to</b> the <b>elevated</b> temperatures of 100 to 800 °C, the results illustrate that the concretes gain compressive strength after being exposed <b>to</b> <b>elevated</b> temperatures of 100, 200 and 300 °C. Afterward, the strength of the LWAGC started to deteriorate and decrease after being exposed <b>to</b> <b>elevated</b> temperatures of 400 °C, and up to 800 °C. Based on the mechanical strength results of the exposed LWAGCs <b>to</b> <b>elevated</b> temperatures of 100 °C to 800 °C, the relationship between the exposure temperature and the obtained residual compressive strength is statistically analyzed and achieved. In addition, the microstructure investigation of the unexposed LWAGC shows a good bonding between aggregate and mortar at the interface transition zone (ITZ). However, this bonding is subjected to deterioration as the LWAGC is exposed <b>to</b> <b>elevated</b> temperatures of 400, 600 and 800 °C by increasing the microcrack content and swelling of the unreacted silicates...|$|R
40|$|Reproductive {{performance}} {{has been shown}} to be greatly affected by changes in environmental factors, such as temperature. However, it is also crucial to identify the particular stage of pregnancy that is most adversely affected by elevated ambient temperature. The aims of this study were to determine the effect on reproductive outcomes of exposure <b>to</b> <b>elevated</b> ambient temperature during different stages of pregnancy and to determine the effect of prenatal heat stress on offspring growth. Sixty pregnant rats were used in this study. The rats were divided equally into four groups as group 1 (control), group 2 (exposed <b>to</b> <b>elevated</b> temperature following implantation), group 3 (exposed <b>to</b> <b>elevated</b> temperature during pre- and periimplantation), and group 4 (exposed <b>to</b> <b>elevated</b> temperature during pre- and periimplantation and following implantation). Groups 3 and 4 had prolonged gestation periods, reduced litter sizes, and male-biased sex ratios. Moreover, the growth patterns of group 3 and 4 pups were adversely affected by prenatal exposure <b>to</b> <b>elevated</b> temperature. The differences between group 1 and group 3 and between group 1 and group 4 were highly significant. However, no significant differences were observed between groups 1 and 2 in the gestation length, sex ratios, and growth patterns. Thus, it can be concluded that exposure <b>to</b> <b>elevated</b> ambient temperature during pre- and periimplantation has stronger adverse effects on reproductive outcomes and offspring growth than postimplantation exposure...|$|R

40|$|It is {{essential}} to predict the impact of elevated Pco 2 on marine organisms and habitats to anticipate the severity and consequences of future ocean chemistry change. Despite the importance of carry-over effects in the evolutionary history of marine organisms, few studies have considered links between life-history stages when determining how marine organisms will respond <b>to</b> <b>elevated</b> Pco 2, and none have considered the link between adults and their offspring. Herein, we exposed adults of wild and selectively bred Sydney rock oysters, Saccostrea glomerata <b>to</b> <b>elevated</b> Pco 2 during reproductive conditioning and measured the development, growth and survival response of their larvae. We found that elevated Pco 2 had {{a negative impact on}} larvae of S. glomerata causing a reduction in growth, rate of development and survival. Exposing adults <b>to</b> <b>elevated</b> Pco 2 during reproductive conditioning, however, had positive carry-over effects on larvae. Larvae spawned from adults exposed <b>to</b> <b>elevated</b> Pco 2 were larger and developed faster, but displayed similar survival compared with larvae spawned from adults exposed to ambient Pco 2. Furthermore, selectively bred larvae of S. glomerata were more resilient <b>to</b> <b>elevated</b> Pco 2 than wild larvae. Measurement of the standard metabolic rate (SMR) of adult S. glomerata showed that at ambient Pco 2, SMR is increased in selectively bred compared with wild oysters and is further increased during exposure <b>to</b> <b>elevated</b> Pco 2. This study suggests that sensitive marine organisms may have the capacity to acclimate or adapt <b>to</b> <b>elevated</b> Pco 2 over the next century and a change in energy turnover indicated by SMR may be a key process involved. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Despite its relevance, {{few studies}} {{to date have}} {{analysed}} the role of harvest index (HI) in the responsiveness of wheat (Triticum spp.) <b>to</b> <b>elevated</b> CO 2 concentration ([CO 2]) under limited water availability. The goal of the present work was to characterise the role of HI in the physiological responsiveness of durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) exposed <b>to</b> <b>elevated</b> [CO 2] and terminal (i. e. during grain filling) water stress. For this purpose, the performance of wheat plants with high versus low HI (cvv. Sula and Blanqueta, respectively) was assessed under elevated [CO 2](700 m molmol- 1 vs 400 m molmol- 1 CO 2) and terminal water stress (imposed after ear emergence) in CO 2 greenhouses. Leaf carbohydrate build-up combined with limitations in CO 2 diffusion (in droughted plants) limited the responsiveness <b>to</b> <b>elevated</b> [CO 2] in both cultivars. Elevated [CO 2] only increased wheat yield in fully watered Sula plants, where its larger HI prevented an elevated accumulation of total nonstructural carbohydrates. It {{is likely that the}} putative shortened grain filling period in plants exposed to water stress also limited the responsiveness of plants <b>to</b> <b>elevated</b> [CO 2]. In summary, our study showed that even under optimal water availability conditions, only plants with a high HI responded <b>to</b> <b>elevated</b> [CO 2] with increased plant growth, and that terminal drought constrained the responsiveness of wheat plants <b>to</b> <b>elevated</b> [CO 2 Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|A {{possible}} {{relationship between}} protein kinase C activation and impaired receptor-mediated endothelium-dependent relaxation in diabetes mellitus was examined in isolated aorta from normal rabbit exposed <b>to</b> <b>elevated</b> glucose.

Relaxations to the receptor-independent endothelium-dependent vasodilator, A 23187, and those {{caused by the}} direct smooth muscle vasodilator, sodium nitroprusside, were unaffected by treatment with PMA or exposure <b>to</b> <b>elevated</b> glucose.
