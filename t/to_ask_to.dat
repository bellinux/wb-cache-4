5|$|Candidates for Freemasonry {{will have}} met most active {{members of the}} Lodge they are joining before they are initiated. The process varies between jurisdictions, but the {{candidate}} will typically have been introduced by a friend at a Lodge social function, or at some form of open evening in the Lodge. In modern times, interested people often track down a local Lodge through the Internet. The onus is on candidates <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>to</b> join; while candidates may be encouraged to ask, they are never invited. Once the initial inquiry is made, an interview usually follows to determine the candidate's suitability. If the candidate decides to proceed from here, the Lodge ballots on the application before he (or she, depending on the Masonic Jurisdiction) can be accepted.|$|E
5|$|Referring to this period, John Martyn (who in 1973 {{wrote the}} title song of his album Solid Air for and about Drake) {{described}} him as the most withdrawn person he had ever met. He would borrow his mother's car and drive for hours without purpose on occasion, until {{he ran out of}} petrol and had to ring his parents <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>to</b> be collected. Friends have recalled the extent to which his appearance had changed. During particularly bleak periods of his illness, he refused to wash his hair or cut his nails. Early in 1972, Drake had a nervous breakdown, and was hospitalized for five weeks.|$|E

They discuss Laura's death; Hurley and Hayward believe Laura hid a diary {{at her home}} and want Ferguson, who is now staying there, to look for it. They leave as Jennings and Shelly arrive; Hank is seated at another table and pulls Jennings aside <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>to</b> start working in order to regain her trust. Meanwhile, using a {{photograph}} from Renault's home and the clues from Cooper's dream, the investigators find a log cabin in the woods that {{they believe to be}} the scene of the murder; on the floor Cooper finds a fragment of a One Eyed Jacks casino chip that matches the piece found in Laura's stomach, and Truman finds Waldo, the caged myna bird.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the average}} {{duration}} of a Central Committee meeting decreased, and fewer meetings were held, many Central Committee members {{were unable to}} speak. Some members consulted the leadership beforehand, <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>to</b> speak during meetings. During the May 1966 Central Committee plenum, Brezhnev openly complained that only one member had asked him personally {{to be allowed to}} speak. The majority of speakers at Central Committee plenums were high-standing officials.|$|E
25|$|During 1952, Franklin {{also refused}} to {{participate}} in molecular modeling efforts and continued to work on step-by-step detailed analysis of her X-ray diffraction data (Patterson synthesis). By the spring of 1952, Franklin had received permission from Randall <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>to</b> transfer her fellowship {{so that she could}} leave King's College and work in John Bernal's laboratory at Birkbeck College, also in London. Franklin remained at King's College until the middle of March, 1953.|$|E
25|$|Turner was {{concerned}} {{also with the}} situation of Cyprus and in February 1958 declared that he would rejoin the Parliamentary Conservative Party if he got an undertaking that the Government would not weaken their attitude there. By June 1958, Turner and the remaining Independent Conservatives declared that they now agreed with the Government's foreign policy, and the five wrote <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>to</b> be readmitted to the Conservative whip. After seeing Edward Heath, his application was approved.|$|E

25|$|Cali {{is served}} by over 20 coach {{companies}} which gather in the Central Bus Station. The Station is centrally located near the old (now redundant) railway station, which serves now as Metrocali's headquarters. Depending on {{the company and the}} destination, the vehicles range from minibuses to large coaches. Recently, in their last float renovation wave, Colombian coaches operators have opted for Brazil's Marcopolo buses. Informal stops exist for the short destination rides all along the way from Central Station to the town of destination.

25|$|Hart spent a much of {{his free}} time during World War II {{performing}} and organising different sports events to raise funds to the war effort. As an active sailor and director of athletics Hart {{was the leader of}} all the sports teams available and a member of them as well, most notably the fastball team and the wrestling team. Hart originally wanted to leave the Navy when the war was over but the organisation considered him to be a great asset both as a trainer as well as showpiece and persuaded him to stay. He would attempt <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>to</b> be let go several times later but was told to stay again. Eventually Hart was given his disharge from the Navy in early 1946.|$|E
25|$|During the Geonic period (650–1250 CE), the Babylonian {{schools were}} the chief centers of Jewish learning; the Geonim, {{the heads of}} these schools, were {{recognized}} as the highest authorities in Jewish law. Despite difficulties that hampered the irregular communications of the period, Jews who lived even in most distant countries sent their inquiries concerning religion and law to these officials in Babylonia. It was common for Jews outside of Babylon <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>to</b> be sent {{a section of the}} Talmud along with “its explanation” or to ask the scholars in Babylon to settle Jewish arguments for which they could not find any precedent. The length of responsa from this period can span from less than a sentence to a large book. Many of the responsa are still being studied today in the Cairo Genizah. In the yeshiva during this time period, students and scholars would discuss these halakhic questions during kallah and then the head of the yeshiva would announce his decision and the leaders in the yeshiva would sign it. Another type of responsa were those that were more time-sensitive, so the gaon usually responded to them right away and with many different sections in order to answer multiple questions that were posed. Later Geonim also referred to the responsa and commentaries of earlier Geonim when writing responsa. In the latter centuries of the geonic period, {{from the middle of the}} tenth to the middle of the eleventh, their supremacy suffered, as the study of the Talmud received care in other lands. The inhabitants of these regions gradually began to submit their questions to the heads of the schools of their own countries. Eventually they virtually ceased sending their questions to Babylonian Geonim, so that during this period responsa of eminent rabbis of other lands appeared side by side with geonic rulings.|$|E
25|$|When Grant's nephew Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid) goes {{missing and}} Phil is {{reluctant}} to get the police involved, Sharon contacts Grant for help, but Courtney (now Alice Nokes) meets Sharon instead; Grant has not seen the messages. Sharon decides {{to go to the}} police and finds Grant outside the police station as a result of being drunk and disorderly. Grant goes to The Queen Vic where he flirts with Belinda Peacock (Carli Norris). Grant tells Courtney that Phil killed Peggy. When Courtney tells Grant that Sharon wanted to meet him, he goes to see Sharon and declares his love to her, but she is not interested. Grant accuses Phil of killing Peggy and asks for his money back, but Phil does not have it. Grant tries to persuade Sharon to go to Portugal with him but she declares her love for Phil. Grant telephones Courtney <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>to</b> stay with her but she refuses. Grant then meets Belinda again and they go to her home for sex but are interrupted by her family. Phil finds a letter in Sharon's bag that Michelle sent Peggy, revealing that Grant fathered Michelle's child, Mark Fowler (Ned Porteous) 21 years previously. Grant visits Jane where he learns that she has been paralysed by her adoptive son Bobby Beale (Eliot Carrington). He admits that he has lost his home and business in Portugal and is in debt. Grant and Jane both comfort each other, but Ian walks in on them and shouts at Grant for deserting his family. Grant leaves, ignoring Phil, who is attempting to tell him about Mark. Courtney calls Grant, who is staying with Sal due to losing his villa and bar in Portugal, for help after Ben and Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) are kidnapped by the men who attacked Ben and killed his boyfriend Paul Coker (Jonny Labey). Grant rushes to Courtney's aid and assumes Mark is attacking her, but Sharon tells him he is Michelle's son. Phil initially insists he does not need Grant's help but then accepts it. Phil collapses so Grant vows to rescue Ben. Mark gets in Grant's car to help him, and they find Ben and Grant scares off the men. Grant reconciles with Phil, admitting he no longer wants the money Phil borrowed from him, and Phil tells Grant that Mark is his son. Courtney is angry with Grant when he stops her kissing Mark. Grant confronts Ian about keeping the secret for so long and punches him after Ian insults his parenting skills. Sharon tells him the reasons Michelle did not want him involved and Grant agrees that Mark would be better off not knowing, but Jane convinces Grant otherwise, so Grant offers to take Mark for a drink. After a heart to heart, Grant realizes that Mark would be better off not knowing and decides to return to Portugal after seeing Phil. Phil gives him money, and he reunites with Courtney and the pair return to Portugal. Mark also works out who Grant is, but Sharon convinces him he is better off with his adopted father.|$|E
