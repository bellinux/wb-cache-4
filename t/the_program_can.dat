5|$|Woodward {{asserts that}} the U.S. is {{implementing}} a secret killing program in Iraq targeting designated terrorists and that this program in large parts accounts for the significant drop in violence in the country. This program may have been being carried out by Task Force 77. The secrecy surrounding <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>can,</b> according to Woodward, in some ways {{be compared to the}} Manhattan Project during World War II in which the atomic bomb was developed amidst an unprecedented veil of secrecy. Following the publication of the book, U.S. National security adviser Stephen Hadley acknowledged the existence of the described strategy.|$|E

25|$|Note {{that even}} though an {{uncaught}} exception may result in the program terminating abnormally (the program may not be correct if an exception is not caught, notably by not rolling back partially completed transactions, or not releasing resources), the process terminates normally (assuming the runtime works correctly), as the runtime (which is controlling execution of <b>the</b> <b>program)</b> <b>can</b> ensure orderly shutdown of the process.|$|E
25|$|The {{main purpose}} of the SSR is to house {{graduate}} students, undergraduate students of the ages 24 and older, and professional students. The third and fourth floors house undergraduate students of the ages of 21 through 23. The nursing house {{is located on the}} 16th floor. The fifth floor of the SSR has a pilot program for students with families. <b>The</b> <b>program</b> <b>can</b> house up to 15 families.|$|E
25|$|Performance {{bottlenecks}} can be due {{to language}} limitations rather than algorithms or data structures used in the program. Sometimes, {{a critical part of}} <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>can</b> be re-written in a different programming language that gives more direct access to the underlying machine. For example, it is common for very high-level languages like Python to have modules written in C for greater speed. Programs already written in C can have modules written in assembly. Programs written in D can use the inline assembler.|$|E

25|$|Lead-by-the-nose: {{this is a}} {{technique}} offered by many robot manufacturers. In this method, one user holds the robot's manipulator, while another person enters a command which de-energizes the robot causing it to go into limp. The user then moves the robot by hand to the required positions and/or along a required path while the software logs these positions into memory. <b>The</b> <b>program</b> <b>can</b> later run the robot to these positions or along the taught path. This technique is popular for tasks such as paint spraying.|$|E
25|$|AAST {{was founded}} on a charter school {{framework}} in 1992 with the mission of preparing students for careers {{in math and science}} by promoting a problem-solving, project-based, technical learning environment. AAST has departed from this model and has since become a more standard magnet school. The roots of <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>can</b> be seen in its unique science curriculum, which emphasizes and integrates chemistry, biology, and physics, and its hallmark Wednesday lab rotation for the first two years. This academy celebrated ten years of excellence in 2006-07. Much of the AAST model, including the 6-mod project period on Wednesday, has been adopted by the other academies.|$|E
25|$|Arguably, {{concurrent}} {{logic programming}} {{is based on}} message passing and consequently {{is subject to the}} same indeterminacy as other concurrent message-passing systems, such as Actors (see Indeterminacy in concurrent computation). Carl Hewitt has argued that, concurrent logic programming is not based on logic in his sense that computational steps cannot be logically deduced. However, in concurrent logic programming, any result of a terminating computation is a logical consequence of the program, and any partial result of a partial computation is a logical consequence of the program and the residual goal (process network). Consequently, the indeterminacy of computations implies that not all logical consequences of <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>can</b> be deduced.|$|E

25|$|On many systems, a program's {{virtual address}} may refer to data {{which is not}} {{currently}} in memory. The layer of indirection provided by virtual addressing allows the operating system to use other data stores, like a hard drive, to store what would otherwise have to remain in main memory (RAM). As a result, operating systems can allow programs to use more memory than the system has physically available. When a program needs data which is not currently in RAM, the CPU signals to the kernel that this has happened, and the kernel responds by writing the contents of an inactive memory block to disk (if necessary) {{and replacing it with}} the data requested by the program. <b>The</b> <b>program</b> <b>can</b> then be resumed from the point where it was stopped. This scheme is generally known as demand paging.|$|E
