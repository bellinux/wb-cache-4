One of the determinants that identifies who is likely to feel <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> point will be met is the bid itself.

5|$|One {{contentious}} {{point in}} Denholm-Young's article was his assertion {{that there was}} no mention of <b>the</b> <b>Provisions</b> of Oxford in the Mise of Lewes. This was an idea that John Maddicott strongly contested in an 1983 article. According to Maddicott, <b>the</b> <b>provisions</b> had been at the centre of Montfort's opposition over the last six years, and it was unlikely that he would give them up so easily. Nevertheless, Montfort showed willingness to negotiate the terms of <b>the</b> <b>provisions.</b> As such, the Mise of Lewes was a moderate document; Montfort wanted to avoid a repetition of the situation after the Mise of Amiens. Rather it was external circumstances outside of Montfort's control that led to the eventual failure of the negotiations between the royalists and the barons.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{investigation}} of the relationship of managerial compensation to <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> for loan losses. This study discusses the arguments that have made the relationship between managerial compensation and <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> for loan losses an intuitively appealing concept within the broad agency literature, and, based on these arguments, conducts empirical tests aimed at determining whether managerial compensation does relate to <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> for loan losses. ^ The most current means of studying the income-compensation relationship, the compensation coefficients, makes finding a good understanding of managerial compensation and <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> for loan loss reserves an important goal. <b>The</b> loan loss <b>provision</b> is hypothesized to be a function of loan quality and managerial compensation. If internal and external parties interested in bank performance and reporting better understand the relationship between managerial compensation and <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> for loan losses, more efficient labor contracts can be written and financial performance and reporting should be improved. ^ The structure of the empirical tests flows from the argument that earnings management represents a cost to shareholders. This argument rests on the assumption that <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> for loan losses specifically plays a central role in managerial compensation at financial institutions. Recent work in agency theory is utilized to construct the setting in which <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> for loan losses is tested for its ability to influence earnings. The empirical model constructed is a multiple regression equation with <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> for loan loss as the dependent variable, and asset equity, income and compensation item as independent variables. ^ The empirical results show that the relationship between managerial compensation and <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> for loan losses is much like the arguments would suggest. Although assets, equity and income are the dominant factors in explaining <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> for loan losses, managerial compensation plays a role in explaining <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> for loan losses. ...|$|R

5|$|By 1264, {{the reign}} of Henry III was deeply troubled by {{disputes}} between the king and his nobility. The conflict was caused by several factors: the influence of foreigners at court, a wasteful war over the crown of Sicily, and a personal dispute between King Henry and Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester. In 1258, Henry was forced to accept the so-called Provisions of Oxford, whereby he effectively surrendered control of royal government to a council of magnates. In 1259 the baronial program of reform was further elaborated upon in <b>the</b> <b>Provisions</b> of Westminster. <b>The</b> <b>provisions</b> remained in effect for three years; {{it was not until}} 1261 that Henry was able to move against the opposition. Receiving the papal annulment of <b>the</b> <b>provisions</b> his emissaries had campaigned for, he re-assumed control of government. Over the next two years, however, discontent re-emerged over Henry's style of government. He failed to be reconciled with Montfort, and he also alienated Gloucester's son and heir Gilbert. In April 1263 Montfort returned to England after a long stay in France, and reignited the reform movement. On 16 July Henry was surrounded by rebel forces in the Tower of London, and once more forced to accept the conditions of <b>the</b> <b>provisions.</b> Prince Edwardthe later King Edward I – now took control of the situation. In October Edward took Windsor Castle, and the baronial alliance started to break up.|$|E

30|$|We {{have shown}} how SDG-Pro {{provides}} API encapsulation {{of the most}} important aspects related to gateway provisioning and governance. A key advantage of this approach is that developers do not need to explicitly worry about the underlying infrastructure. Rather, they perceive the complex and heterogeneous IoT cloud infrastructure as a set of uniform APIs that enable programmatic management of such infrastructure. Our SDG-Pro framework supports the developers to declaratively provision IoT cloud systems and to automate most of <b>the</b> <b>provisioning</b> process. This improves general readability and maintainability of <b>the</b> <b>provisioning</b> logic and simplifies <b>the</b> <b>provisioning</b> process. Additionally, by encoding <b>the</b> <b>provisioning</b> directives as part of application’s source code, our framework makes <b>the</b> <b>provisioning</b> process easily repeatable. This reduces the potential errors, but more importantly enables continuous, automated enforcement of the configuration base line.|$|R
