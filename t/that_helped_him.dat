5|$|After {{a two-year}} {{career with the}} Penticton Panthers, {{in which he was}} named Canadian Junior A Player of the Year in 1992, Kariya joined the college ranks with the University of Maine's Black Bears men's ice hockey team. In his {{freshman}} year, he received the Hobey Baker Award while leading his team to the 1993 NCAA title. Selected fourth overall in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft by the Mighty Ducks, he joined the team in 1994–95 and was named to the NHL All-Rookie Team. During his nine-year tenure with Anaheim, Kariya formed an effective duo with fellow winger Teemu Selänne <b>that</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> to three NHL First All-Star Team distinctions, while also finishing as the first runner-up for the Hart Memorial Trophy in 1997. Not an aggressive player, he won back-to-back Lady Byng Trophies in 1996 and 1997 as the League's most gentlemanly player. Serving as a captain for seven seasons, he led the Mighty Ducks to the 2003 Stanley Cup Finals, where they lost to the New Jersey Devils in seven games. After a single-season stint with the Avalanche for the purpose of reuniting with Selänne, who had previously been traded away from Anaheim, Kariya signed with the Predators in August 2005. He played two seasons in Nashville, setting team records for assists and points scored in a single-season in 2005–06. Kariya then finished his career playing three seasons with the Blues.|$|E
5|$|Verity {{regained his}} place in the team for the third Test, {{replacing}} Bowes. The match was highly controversial owing to England's continued and increased use of Bodyline tactics. Verity's main contributions to the match came from his batting: he shared partnerships worth over 90 runs in both innings, scoring 45runs in the first innings and 40 in the second. He took one wicket in the game; after 16wicketless overs in the first innings, Verity dismissed Bradman in the second, his first Test wicket against Australia, and England won the match by 338runs. After the third Test, the MCC played New South Wales again. Rain before the beginning of the third day affected the pitch; Bradman, possibly irritated by a minor show of bravado from Verity, scored 71 in conditions which should have been perfect for the Yorkshireman, who took only two wickets. During the fourth Test, Verity took few wickets but Wisden noted that he kept a good length and prevented the Australian batsmen scoring quickly. His batting was important once more. In their first innings, England had lost eight wickets, and were still 76runs behind Australia's score when Verity joined Paynter, who had left a hospital bed where he had been confined with tonsillitis. The two men scored 92runs together, to give England a small lead. Verity scored 23 not out in two-and-three-quarter hours, although he was lucky not to be dismissed several times. Australia were bowled out in their second innings and Verity took two wickets; England scored the required runs to record a six-wicket win which ensured victory in the series—and the Ashes. Verity's bowling was most successful in the final Test, when Jardine allowed him to depart from his role of restricting the batsmen's scoring and bowl a more attacking line and length in an attempt to take wickets. Having taken three for 62 in Australia's first innings, he took five for 33 in the second, assisted by a worn pitch <b>that</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> to spin the ball. He dismissed Bradman for 71 and later took two wickets with successive deliveries.|$|E

25|$|Despite his {{financial}} difficulties, Ali Bourguiba dedicated {{a great deal}} of attention to his children's education. This was criticized by his brother Mohamed who reproached him for giving too much consideration to their instruction. But he succeeded in providing good education for his children with his military pension, which led to their ascent in important jobs. His first born child, Mohamed, worked in Tunis as a nurse in Sadiki Hospital. Ahmed and Mohamed worked in the state administration. When Bourguiba was born, his brother, Mahmoud, was pursuing his studies in Sadiki College. In that year, Ali became councilman of Monastir, a job <b>that</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> provide a modern education to Bourguiba.|$|E

25|$|Sa'id al-Dawla's father, Sa'd al-Dawla, {{had only}} with {{difficulty}} managed to first secure {{a measure of}} control over his domains, and then to maintain a precarious autonomy by manoeuvring between the Byzantine Empire, the Fatimids of Egypt, and the Buyids in Iraq, alternating between warfare and recognizing the suzerainty of each power in turn. The once-proud emirate, which under Sa'id al-Dawla's grandfather Sayf al-Dawla included all of northern Syria {{and much of the}} Jazira, had now shrunk to the region around Aleppo. Sa'd al-Dawla's domestic position was precarious, and his state was impoverished and militarily impotent. After the Byzantine–Fatimid peace of 987/8, he came to depend once more on the Byzantines, and it was Byzantine troops <b>that</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> defeat a Fatimid-sponsored attempt to seize Aleppo by the former Hamdanid governor Bakjur in April 991.|$|E
25|$|The man and {{the myth}} merge in this episode.

Nintendo Power editors told Joystiq that Suda considers Travis his favorite character. Suda states that No More Heroes 2 will be Travis' last appearance in the series, as his story will be completely finished.

25|$|Although Eugene {{was not of}} Austrian extraction, he {{did have}} Habsburg antecedents. His grandfather, Thomas Francis, founder of the Carignano line of the House of Savoy, {{was the son of}} Catherine Michelle—a {{daughter}} of Philip II of Spain—and the great-grandson of the Emperor Charles V. But of more immediate consequence to Leopold I was the fact that Eugene was the second cousin of Victor Amadeus, the Duke of Savoy, a connection that the Emperor hoped might prove useful in any future confrontation with France. These ties, together with his ascetic manner and appearance (a positive advantage to him at the sombre court of Leopold I), ensured the refugee from the hated French king a warm welcome at Passau, and a position in Imperial service. Though French was his favored language, he communicated with Leopold in Italian, as the Emperor (though he knew it perfectly) disliked French. But Eugene also had a reasonable command of German, which he understood very easily, something <b>that</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> much in the military.|$|E
25|$|When Ward {{was twelve}} years old, his mother died {{unexpectedly}} during childbirth and, in the ensuing chaos, the young man left home to travel around the United States by freight train. He headed north, supporting himself with occasional work as a boot-black, hotel bellboy, and barber-shop porter, but eventually ended up in jail for bootlegging in Salt Lake City, Utah. Ward rediscovered his love for writing, and eventually amassed an impressive corpus of poetry, short stories, and essays <b>that</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> to gain entry into an extension program at the University of Utah in 1930. While there, his professor, Louis Zucker, encouraged Ward {{to apply for the}} prestigious Zona Gale Fellowship in creative writing at the University of Wisconsin. Ward's essay won the prize, and he departed for the one-year program in Madison, where he studied literature and dramatic arts in addition to working as a script writer and voice actor for WIBA-Radio Madison. Although Zona Gale personally extended Ward's fellowship and arranged for him to stay and enter a degree program despite his lack of a high school education, the young man declined, citing the unendurable isolation suffered by a black man in an all-white school.|$|E
25|$|Aftab Ahmed, the batsman {{used as an}} all-rounder {{with his}} medium pace in ODIs, got a bit of {{movement}} in the conditions, and <b>that</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> to take two wickets - those of Tharanga and Kumar Sangakkara. However, he also bowled five wides in the process, {{and one of them}} even went to the boundary for four runs. Ahmed conceded 55 runs off his ten overs, and the two wickets did not help Bangladesh much, as Mahela Jayawardene and Russel Arnold helped themselves to boundaries as the innings neared a close. Spinner Mohammad Rafique toiled for Bangladesh, but could only get one wicket for plenty of runs, although a stumping chance went begging earlier on. Arnold was run {{out at the end of}} the 43rd over, though, and Manjural Islam Rana got a wicket with his very last delivery of the day, as the new batsman Tillakaratne Dilshan swept a top edge to Syed Rasel down the leg side. The wickets slowed Sri Lanka down somewhat, but only temporarily, as Jayawardene quickly got on top of the bowling again. In the final over of Sri Lanka's innings, three wickets fell, Jayawardene eventually being run out having added 50 runs in an hour. Sri Lanka closed on 269 for 9.|$|E
