500|$|The large maxillary fossae of Euchambersia {{have been}} continual {{subjects}} of debate regarding their function. However, most researchers {{agree that they}} held some sort of secretory gland. While Broom initially argued that the fossae may have contained the parotid salivary glands, this proposal was rejected by Boonstra and J.P. Lehman, who noted that the parotid glands tend to be placed behind the eye; they respectively suggested that the fossae held modified lacrimal glands and Harderian glands. However, the latter is also unlikely because Harderian glands are usually placed inside the eye socket. Franz Nopcsa suggested that the maxillary fossae housed venom glands (which may have been derived from lacrimal glands), with the ridged canines and <b>the</b> <b>notches</b> behind the canines allowing the venom to flow passively into the victim's bloodstream. This hypothesis was widely accepted throughout the 20th century and the characteristic morphology of Euchambersia was used to support possible venom-bearing adaptations among various other prehistoric animals, including the therocephalian Ichibengops.|$|E

2500|$|When it {{had been}} decided to {{transfer}} the Composites to the elevated division of the IRT in 1916, the cars' braking was modernized further. In AMRE schedule braking, the electric brake must be activated at all times by use of the electric brake key to synchronize the train's braking effort electrically. If it was not [...] "cut in" [...] or failed en route, the system could still be manipulated to apply the brakes pneumatically. This would still allow the train to stop, but deceleration would take longer such as on the older AM(P) schedule braking. However, in AMRE, <b>the</b> <b>notches</b> in the brake stand to cause this pneumatic application are completely separate from <b>the</b> <b>notches</b> to cause an electric application. Therefore, if a motorman with a defective or inactive electric AMRE brake were to electrically apply the brakes, nothing would happen! Valuable seconds would be lost while he realized his electric brake was inactive, before he could move to the pneumatic apply notch to begin slowing his train down (which would still take longer than usual without electric synchronization of the brakes). In a serious scenario, this could cause him to overshoot a station or an important stopping point, or overspeed. In a new braking schedule known as AMUE, however, the electric and pneumatic notches are joined together on the motorman's brake stand. Therefore, even if the electric brake is defective or inactive, his moving the brake handle to the apply position would still begin setting up a pneumatic application of the brakes, creating a much quicker response to the condition than possible under any other previous system. As part of the modifications for elevated service, the Composites were equipped with AMUE schedule braking from 1916 until their retirement.|$|E
2500|$|Hand axes can be {{made without}} {{subsequent}} reworking of the edges. A hammerstone {{was the most common}} percussive tool used during the Acheulean. The resulting artefact is usually easily recognizable given its size and irregular edges, as the removed flakes leave pronounced percussion bulbs and compression rings. A hammerstone produces a small number of flakes that are wide and deep leaving long edges on the tool as their highly concave form yields curving edges.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>The</b> <b>Notch</b> {{signaling}} pathway {{has been shown}} to be involved in the development of the nervous system. Recent studies showed that Notch receptors and ligands are also expressed in the nervous system of adult animals. However, whether <b>the</b> <b>Notch</b> {{signaling pathway}} has a function in adults is not fully understood. The present study is designed to investigate the function of <b>the</b> <b>Notch</b> signaling pathway in nociceptive transmission, especially during neuropathic pain in adult rats. Results We found that <b>the</b> <b>Notch</b> intracellular domain (NICD) is expressed in the DRG (Dorsal Root Ganglia), sciatic nerve and spinal cord in normal rats, and is upregulated in the sciatic nerve and spinal cord after spared nerve injury (SNI). Moreover, we used the γ-secretase (a key enzyme of <b>the</b> <b>Notch</b> signaling pathway) inhibitor DAPT to observe the effect of <b>the</b> <b>Notch</b> signaling pathway after SNI. We found that intrathecal DAPT significantly increased paw withdrawal thermal latency and mechanical threshold.

Conclusions These results suggest that <b>the</b> <b>Notch</b> signaling pathway participates in the induction and maintenance of neuropathic pain, which indicates that <b>the</b> <b>Notch</b> pathway maybe a potential drug target for neuropathic pain treatment. </p...|$|R
