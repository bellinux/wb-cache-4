5|$|If the plantar fascia {{continues}} to be overused {{in the setting of}} plantar fasciitis, the plantar fascia can rupture.

5000|$|Groberg {{really did}} have rats eat <b>the</b> <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> his feet while he slept. When he awoke that morning, they split open, {{and the members of}} his branch helped treat his feet.

Later in life, he was {{diagnosed}} with skin cancer on <b>the</b> <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> his feet due to exposure to the sun.

5|$|Standardized system: Boots and {{bindings}} have {{an integrated}} connection, typically a bar {{across the front}} end of <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> the boot, and platform on which the boot rests. Two families of standards prevail: NNN (New Nordic Norm) and SNS (Salomon Nordic System) Profil. Both systems have variants for skiing on groomed surfaces and in back country. These systems are {{the most common type of}} binding.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} is poorly understood and {{is thought to}} likely have several contributing factors. The plantar fascia is a thick fibrous band of connective tissue that originates from the medial tubercle and anterior aspect of the heel bone. From there, the fascia extends along <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> the foot before inserting {{at the base of}} the toes, and supports the arch of the foot.|$|E
5|$|Normal {{blood flow}} is {{anterograde}} (going to the heart), and from superficial to deep veins via perforator veins. However, {{there are two}} exceptions: firstly, the great saphenous vein (GSV) collaterals, (the veins that run parallel), drain the abdominal wall and have a flow {{from top to bottom}} so that when an examiner tests the sapheno-femoral junction, a false positive diagnosis might be made; secondly, in the flow from <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> the foot venous network around 10% drains to the dorsal venous arch of the foot, going therefore against the norm, from deep to superficial veins.|$|E

5|$|Plantar {{fasciitis}} {{is usually}} diagnosed by {{a health care}} provider after consideration of a person's presenting history, risk factors, and clinical examination. Tenderness to palpation along the inner aspect of the heel bone on <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> the foot may be elicited during the physical examination. The foot may have limited dorsiflexion due to tightness of the calf muscles or the Achilles tendon. Dorsiflexion of the foot may elicit the pain due to stretching of the plantar fascia with this motion. Diagnostic imaging studies are not usually needed to diagnose plantar fasciitis. However, in certain cases a physician may decide imaging studies (such as X-rays, diagnostic ultrasound or MRI) are warranted to rule out serious causes of foot pain.|$|E

25|$|A stone bruise affects <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> the horse's foot. It {{is often}} {{caused by a}} horse {{treading}} on a stone or sharp type of object, landings from high jumps and excessive exposure to snow. A major symptom is lameness.|$|E
25|$|First, {{each foot}} would be soaked {{in a warm}} mixture of herbs and animal blood; this was {{intended}} to soften the foot and aid the binding. Then, the toenails were cut {{back as far as}} possible to prevent in-growth and subsequent infections, since the toes were to be pressed tightly into <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> the foot. Cotton bandages, 3m long and 5cm wide (10ft by 2 in), were prepared by soaking them in the blood and herb mixture. To enable the size of the feet to be reduced, the toes on each foot were curled under, then pressed with great force downwards and squeezed into <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> the foot until the toes broke.|$|E
