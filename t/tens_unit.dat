50|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} {{for pain}} control {{was used in}} ancient Rome, 63 A.D. It was reported by Scribonius Largus that pain was relieved by standing on an electrical fish at the seashore. In the 16th through the 18th century various electrostatic devices were used for headache and other pains. Benjamin Franklin was a proponent of this method for pain relief. In the 19th century a device called the electreat, along with numerous other devices were used for pain control and cancer cures. Only the electreat survived into the 20th century, but was not portable, and had limited control of the stimulus. Development of modern <b>TENS</b> <b>unit</b> is generally credited to C. Norman Shealy.|$|E
50|$|Transcutaneous {{electrical}} {{nerve stimulation}} (TENS or TNS) {{is the use}} of electric current produced by a device to stimulate the nerves for therapeutic purposes. TENS, by definition, covers the complete range of transcutaneously applied currents used for nerve excitation although the term is often used with a more restrictive intent, namely to describe the kind of pulses produced by portable stimulators used to treat pain. The unit is usually connected to the skin using two or more electrodes. A typical battery-operated <b>TENS</b> <b>unit</b> is able to modulate pulse width, frequency and intensity. Generally TENS is applied at high frequency (>50 Hz) with an intensity below motor contraction (sensory intensity) or low frequency (<10 Hz) with an intensity that produces motor contraction. While the use of TENS has proved effective in clinical studies, there is controversy over which conditions the device should be used to treat.|$|E

40|$|Aim: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} effectiveness of transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) as a means of stimulating salivary function in healthy adult subjects. Materials and Methods: Fifty healthy adult subjects with no history of salivary gland disorder were enrolled in the protocol. The TENS electrode pads were placed externally on the skin overlying the parotid glands. Unstimulated saliva was collected for 5 min into graduated tubes. <b>TENS</b> <b>unit</b> was then activated and the stimulated saliva collected for an additional 5 min. Statistical Analysis Used: A paired "t" test was applied to look for statistically significant differences as a group between the amount of unstimulated and TENS-stimulated samples of saliva. Results: Forty-three out of 50 subjects demonstrated increased salivary flow when stimulated via the <b>TENS</b> <b>unit.</b> The mean unstimulated salivary flow rate was 0. 354 ml/min (SD 0. 19) and the mean stimulated salivary flow rate was 0. 49 ml/min (SD 0. 24). Statistical analysis of flow rates utilizing the paired t test demonstrated the difference to be statistically significant (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: The <b>TENS</b> <b>unit</b> was effective in increasing the salivary flow in two-thirds of healthy adult subjects.

40|$|Background and Objectives : Xerostomia and {{salivary gland}} hypofunction are {{associated}} with advancing age, autoimmune diseases such as Sjφgren′s syndrome, head and neck radiation, smoking and recreational drug usage. Palliative management of xerostomia includes topical agents such as ice chips, saliva substitutes, increasing water intake, paraffin and citric acid containing lozenges. Systemic agents have been used, but some drugs {{have been found to}} have unfavorable side effects. Therefore, this study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on whole salivary flow rate in healthy adult subjects. Study Design : One hundred healthy adult subjects (50 males and 50 females), with no history of salivary gland disorder, were enrolled in this study. TENS electrode pads were placed externally on the skin overlying the parotid glands. Unstimulated whole saliva was collected for five minutes in a graduated tube, using a standardized collection technique. The <b>TENS</b> <b>unit</b> was then activated and stimulated saliva was collected for an additional five minutes. Results : Eighty five of the 100 subjects demonstrated increased whole salivary flow when stimulated via the <b>TENS</b> <b>unit.</b> Eleven experienced no change and four experienced a decrease in the salivary flow. The mean unstimulated salivary flow rate was 0. 36 ml/min (SD 0. 16) and there was a 21 % increase in the salivary flow following TENS application. Statistical analysis of flow rates utilizing the paired ′t′ test showed the difference to be statistically significant (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Context: Xerostomia is {{a common}} sequel in {{patients}} undergoing irradiation of malignant tumors {{of the head and}} neck. Palliative treatments of xerostomia like topical agents such as ice-chips, saliva substitutes, systemic sialogogues like pilocarpine and cevimeline work well for some patients. Electrostimulation was studied in the past and showed moderate promise but never became part of the mainstream therapy for better management of xerostomia patients. Aims: The aim of the following study is {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (<b>TENS)</b> <b>unit</b> in stimulating the whole salivary flow rate in radiation induced xerostomia patients. Materials and Methods: A total of 40 subjects were included in the study. The study group consisted of 30 individuals and was divided into Group S 1 (n = 20), which was further subdivided into Group S 1 A (n = 10) subjects complaining of dry mouth who were undergoing head and neck radiotherapy with TENS stimulation during the commencement of radiotherapy, on the 3 rd, 6 th week and after a month of completion of radiotherapy and Group S 1 B (n = 10) with TENS stimulation daily during the full course of radiotherapy and Group S 2 (n = 10) subjects complaining of dry mouth who had undergone head and neck radiotherapy that ended 1 month prior to their entry into the study. The control group (n = 10) consisted of healthy individuals not complaining of dry mouth and who have not undergone head and neck radiotherapy. Whole saliva was collected without stimulation for 10 min and after electrostimulation with <b>TENS</b> <b>unit</b> for additional 10 min in a graduated test tube. The results were statistically analyzed using Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis′s test. Results: The data analysis revealed that control and S 1 B group showed increased salivary flow rate after stimulation by TENS therapy compared with the unstimulated salivary flow, whereas in S 1 A and S 2 group it was found to be statistically non-significant. Conclusion: The present study gave us an insight about the effectiveness of TENS therapy in stimulating salivary flow in healthy subjects and it is very effective when used in conjunction with radiation therapy by reducing the side-effects of radiation therapy. Hence, TENS therapy can be used as an adjunctive method for the treatment of xerostomia along with other treatment modalities...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{clinical}} report is to share procedures and results using {{transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation}} (TENS) in the management of pain associated with labor and delivery. Although favorable reports of the use of TENS during labor have been published in Europe, its application in the United States to the labor and delivery process has received little attention and is relatively unknown. We decided to use US equipment in the obstetric department of a US community hospital to verify the European studies. Fifteen patients selected by two obstetricians evaluated the effectiveness of a 3 M <b>TENS</b> <b>unit</b> Model 6240. The criteria for inclusion were willingness to try TENS and ability to understand the procedure. The patients served as their own control and turned the unit off for several contractions during the middle and late periods of the first stage of labor to judge the effectiveness of TENS. Twenty-four hours after delivery, a physical therapist recorded the subjective response of patients and obstetricians sepa-rately on a questionnaire, which gave a rating scale of poor, moderate, or excellent for relief.

40|$|AbstractTranscutaneous {{electrical}} {{nerve stimulation}} on acupoints (Acu-TENS) {{is associated with}} increased exercise duration in healthy individuals and improves forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) in those with respiratory illness. Whether a decrease in airway resistance (AR) is responsible for these respiratory system effects has not been investigated. This pilot study investigated {{the effect of a}} single session of Acu-TENS on AR in healthy people. Twenty individuals were invited to the laboratory twice, 1 week apart, to receive in random order either Acu-TENS or placebo-TENS (no electrical output from the <b>TENS</b> <b>unit)</b> over bilateral Lièquē (LU 7) and Dìnchuăn (EX-B 1), for 45 minutes before and during a submaximal treadmill exercise test following the Bruce protocol. AR, FEV 1, forced vital capacity, rate of perceived exertion and heart rate variability were recorded before, immediately after and 15 minutes after exercise. Immediately after exercise the percentage decrease in AR from baseline was greater in the Acu-TENS group (− 20. 10 ± 4. 00 %) compared to the placebo-TENS group (− 7. 99 ± 3. 43 %) (p= 0. 029). We conclude that the decrease in AR seen with Acu-TENS in healthy individuals could account for the immediate improvement in FEV 1. Acu-TENS may have a role in decreasing AR in patients with airflow limitation...|$|E

40|$|Aims and Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the effectiveness of}} {{transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation}} (TENS) in stimulating salivary flow in post-radiated oral cancer patients, and to compare the salivary flow rate between unstimulated saliva and saliva stimulated with TENS in post-radiated oral cancer patients. Materials and Methods: In 30 patients who underwent radiotherapy for oral cancer, unstimulated saliva was collected every minute for 5 min in a graduated test tube. The <b>TENS</b> <b>unit</b> was activated and stimulated saliva was collected for 5 min in a separate graduated test tube, and the flow rate was compared with the unstimulated salivary flow rate. Results: A statistically significant improvement was seen in saliva production during stimulation (P < 0. 001). In addition, statistically significant increase in TENS stimulated saliva was observed in patients aged ≥ 50 years compared to that in patients aged < 50 years (P < 0. 05). There {{was no significant difference in}} salivary flow rate between the two genders in both stimulated and unstimulated conditions, however, statistically significant increase in salivary flow rate was observed in males under stimulated condition (P < 0. 01).

40|$|To {{provide a}} safe, {{non-invasive}} method of pain relief {{for women in}} labour. BACKGROUND INFORMATION TENS is thought to assist in prevention of the perception of pain sensation {{which is based on}} the Gate Control theory. The small electrical sensations produced by the <b>TENS</b> <b>unit</b> stimulate the large peripheral nerve fibres, and pain sensations are blocked from reaching the brain. It is believed that 1, 2, 3 use of the TENS machine also stimulates the production of natural endorphins. Low level settings (2 - 5 Hz) are believed to stimulate the body to produce endorphins, while high pulse settings (90 - 130 Hz) trigger the ‘pain gate ’ to close preventing the pain stimuli reaching the brain. 4 The TENS machine consists of four electrodes and four flexes which connect these to the machine. The controls adjust the frequency and intensity of the impulse. 3 Use of the TENS appears to be more effective when used early in labour, and women feel it allows them more control over their labour and birth. 3 Limited current evidence indicates that while women would use TENS again in labour, it has not been consistent in proving beneficial for pain relief. However, it has no adverse effect for the woman or the fetus, therefore should be available for use to all women. ...|$|E
40|$|Somatosensory input {{is known}} to be {{essential}} for postural control. The present study examined the effects on postural sway of sensory input delivered via transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) applied to the knees during stance. Electrodes from a dual-channel portable <b>TENS</b> <b>unit</b> were adhered to the skin overlying the lateral and medial aspect of both knees of 20 young healthy volunteers (mean age 24. 0 years, standard deviation 4. 0). Postural sway parameters were obtained during static bipedal stance with an AMTI force platform. Four stimulation conditions were tested with eyes open and with eyes closed: no TENS; TENS applied bilaterally; and TENS applied to either the right or the left knee. Participants underwent two eight-trial blocks, with each trial lasting 30 seconds. The order of conditions was randomized for each participant. Stimulation consisted of a biphasic symmetrical stimulus delivered at the sensory detection level, with a pulse duration of 200 μsec and a pulse frequency of 100 Hz. The application of TENS induced significant reductions in mean sway velocity and in the medio-lateral dispersion of the center of pressure, with no corresponding effect on the anterior-posterior dispersion. These findings suggest that electrical stimulation delivered at the sensory detection level to the lateral aspects of the knees may be effective in improving balance control, and that this effect may be directionally specific...|$|E
