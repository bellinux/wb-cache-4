5|$|Wes grabs {{a can of}} {{gasoline}} and pours a trail from the Jeep to the woods. They lure the Grizzly Bear to it and then set the gasoline on fire. The Jeep explodes, but the bear is unharmed. They decide to try another plan and split up. Wes climbs a tree, leaving his blood covered clothes {{on the ground to}} fool the Bear. While the Bear is sniffing at the clothes, Wes accidentally drops a tire iron, calling the bear's attention up. The bear shakes him out of the tree but he escapes and goes to <b>the</b> <b>shack</b> where Lauren has built a trap. They lure the bear into <b>the</b> <b>shack,</b> and use a trigger to close the front door behind it, locking it in. They celebrate and start to leave but the bear breaks out of <b>the</b> <b>shack</b> and they both try to escape. Unfortunately, Wes stumbles and Lauren tries to get him back up, refusing to leave him behind despite his desperate insistence that she should run. The Bear catches up to them and presumably kills them both.|$|E

Bart and Lisa {{find their way into}} the cockpit of the Duff Blimp, where Bob, having lost his patience thanks to Krusty, tries to detonate the bomb, which {{turns out to be a}} dud. Lisa alerts the police to Bob's location, but Bob deflates the blimp and kidnaps Bart, before stealing the original Wright Brothers aircraft, which had been an exhibit at the air show. Bob attempts to carry out a kamikaze attack against the civil defense shack where Krusty is hiding, but the slow-moving plane ends up merely bouncing harmlessly off <b>the</b> <b>shack.</b> The authorities quickly arrest Bob and take him into custody while Bart is reunited with his family.|$|E
5|$|Hiding {{inside an}} oil field shack while police comb {{the area and}} set up roadblocks, Gil is {{discovered}} by young Suzy who offers to fetch him cookies. Hurrying back to her house, Suzy is caught hoarding cookies by her mother and is forced to reveal who they are for. While her mother calls the police, Suzy slips {{out of the door}} to return to Gil. Her mother chases after her into the oil field, and police cars soon arrive. Realizing Suzy is endangered by being with him, Gil carries the girl out of <b>the</b> <b>shack</b> into the sunlight where he lets her go. He soon transforms into the creature. In the ensuing police chase, Gil slaughters one of the officers and then climbs the stairs {{to the top of a}} tall natural gas tank, where the remaining officer chases after him. As Gil begins to strangle him, the officer shoots Gil in the neck. Mortally wounded, the mutated Gil falls several stories to his death while Buckell, Hoffman and a sobbing Ann watch in dismay.|$|E
60|$|I {{have made}} friends with the engine, but <b>the</b> <b>shacks</b> {{are still looking for}} me. At the next stop, <b>the</b> <b>shacks</b> ride out all three blinds, and as before, I let them go by and deck {{in the middle of the}} train. The crew is on its mettle by now, and the train stops. <b>The</b> <b>shacks</b> are going to ditch me or know the reason why. Three times the mighty {{overland}} stops for me at that station, and each time I elude <b>the</b> <b>shacks</b> and make <b>the</b> decks. But it is hopeless, for they have finally come to an understanding of the situation. I have taught them that they cannot guard the train from me. They must do something else.|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, she {{published}} an autobiography where she detailed how she met Constanzo and the group, her experiences {{when she was}} allegedly taken hostage by Constanzo, her mistreatment by authorities, and her versions of the story. Aldrete claimed she visited Constanzo in Mexico City and was then taken hostage after Constanzo decided to not let her go because he believed that {{she would go to}} the police and tell them where they were hiding. She claimed that Constanzo {{and the rest of the}} group were unaware of the killings that occurred in Matamoros until they found out that the police was looking for them, but went into hiding nonetheless because they feared for their lives. She detailed her alleged mistreatments in jail, and how she underwent beatings, psychological torture, rape, and an unfair trial. Her version of Constanzo's death was different than the official one; she stated that Constanzo was executed by the police when they raided the apartment. She also questioned the police's decision to burn down <b>the</b> <b>shack</b> in Santa Elena, since it was crucial for the investigation and probably contained the fingerprints of the murderers.|$|E

She claims that she helped him because he claimed that he was innocent. Tara notes that Cooper had phoned Tara, and told him to go to a payphone near his police station.
