5|$|Hamilton {{crossed the}} line to win his second race of the season, with Rosberg {{following}} him home in 2nd and Vettel completing the podium with 3rd. Pastor Maldonado had an eventful race. On lap 33, while running in seventh position ahead of teammate Romain Grosjean, he missed the pit entry and lost time, dropping several positions. He then proceeded to spin his car on lap 39 as he attempted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>lost</b> time, and on lap 48 he had a collision with Jenson Button following a long battle for position, damaging his car and retiring with rear brake failure a few laps later. The stewards later deemed Button to be at fault for the incident.|$|E

25|$|The {{speed and}} {{punctuality}} of many LB passenger services {{was the subject}} of widespread criticism in the technical and popular press during the 1890s. This was in part {{due in part to the}} complexity of the system between London and Croydon, with a large number of signals and junctions, the sharing of stretches of line with the SER, and the relatively short routes, which gave little opportunity <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>lost</b> time. The LB gradually began to rebuild its reputation during the twentieth century through improvements to main-line infrastructure and electrification of suburban services.|$|E
25|$|The {{top speed}} of {{some parts of the}} main lines allow trains to travel at 180km/h, these are however small {{sections}} of the main lines which are quickly passed onto slower sections around 140–160km/h. Most parts of the rail network are unelectrified - thus slowing acceleration and top speed. Since 2007 it has been common practice for the infrastructure provider Banedanmark to pad the timetables with extra time to a near European record, resulting in railway companies which only utilize the top speeds <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>lost</b> time.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol {{is often}} used {{as a form of}} {{self-treatment}} of insomnia to induce sleep. However, alcohol use to induce sleep can be a cause of insomnia. Long-term use of alcohol is associated with a decrease in NREM stage 3 and 4 sleep as well as suppression of REM sleep and REM sleep fragmentation. Frequent moving between sleep stages occurs, with awakenings due to headaches, the need to urinate, dehydration, and excessive sweating. Glutamine rebound also plays a role as when someone is drinking; alcohol inhibits glutamine, one of the body's natural stimulants. When the person stops drinking, the body tries <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>lost</b> time by producing more glutamine than it needs.|$|E

25|$|Workers obtain {{information}} about colony needs from the environment, and must respond {{to changes in}} colony structure. Activity in the colony seems to be decentralized, {{with the majority of}} interactions initiated by workers, not the queen. Workers that are more dominant tend to pressure subordinates to forage by dominance interactions, and thus subordinates do the majority of foraging. Those who are foragers must respond to intrinsic and extrinsic changes in colony need in order to maintain levels of food, water and building materials. The job of collecting water seems to belong to a small number of fixated foragers. When water foragers are removed from the nest, the remaining individuals will increase their search rate rather than recruit other workers to become water foragers. This indicates that foraging for water is a specialized job. Nectar collection, however, depends on a larger number of workers. When nectar foragers are removed from the nest, new individuals are recruited to replace them. This may be because the location of nectar is not always known, and nectar foragers are not able to increase their search rate <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>lost</b> workers.|$|E
25|$|At the 2017 Four Continents Championships, Hanyu placed {{third in}} the short program with a score of 97.04 points. He popped his quadruple Salchow-triple toe loop {{combination}} to a double Salchow-triple toe loop combination. Despite this, the Olympic champion was only 6 points behind Nathan Chen (in first) and less than 3.5 points behind Shoma Uno (in second). During his free skating, he started strong with a quadruple loop and a quadruple Salchow, followed by a triple flip, but then popped his second quadruple Salchow-triple toe loop combination attempt to a double Salchow. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>lost</b> points, Hanyu, {{in place of the}} planned triple Axel-double toe loop combination, performed a triple Axel-triple toe loop combination and also substituted the triple Axel-half loop-triple Salchow combination with a quadruple toe loop-double toe loop combination. The reigning Olympic champion also changed his final jumping pass from a triple Lutz to a triple Axel. In the free skating, he pulled up to first with a score of 206.67, but overall finished second behind Nathan Chen, by less than 4 points, and over bronze medalist Shoma Uno, by more than 15.|$|E
25|$|Korean {{courts have}} ruled {{that it may}} violate the {{constitution}} {{for the government to}} limit the amount of money hagwon can charge. In early 2008, the Seoul government was working on changes to the regulations to allow hagwons to set their own hours, citing individual choice as trumping regulation. However, the government reversed its position five days later. The regulations were criticized as ineffective because the city council possessed limited resources to monitor and enforce them. Along with these restrictions, hagwon also had to disclose their tuition amounts to the government so people could complain if the schools attempted to raise the tuition. The licenses of hagwon caught running false advertisements will be revoked. Hagwon are required to issue cash receipts. In July 2009, to help catch violators of these new regulations, the government started a program to reward people who reported them. The regulations were intended to reduce the cost of private education. However, some hagwon added weekend classes to compensate for shorter weekday classes. Other parents have sought out private tutors <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>lost</b> study time. Other hagwon simply ignored the regulations. It was reported in April 2009 that 67percent of hagwon sampled were found to have overcharged for tuition. Forty percent were found to have charged parents over two times the registered tuition amount.|$|E

[...] Another contemporaneous Arts Council report recommended that the RPO should supplement the LSO as resident orchestra at the Barbican Centre; neither proposal came to fruition. During the 1980s, the British government imposed strict constraints on public spending; <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>lost</b> revenue, the RPO, along with the other self-governing London orchestras, was forced into increased reliance on business sponsorship as a primary source of funds.

2500|$|The British {{government}} also threatened {{legal action against}} purchasers of oil produced in the formerly British-controlled refineries and obtained an agreement with its sister international oil companies not to fill in where the AIOC was boycotting Iran. The entire Iranian oil industry came to a virtual standstill, oil production dropping from [...] in 1950 to [...] in 1952. This Abadan Crisis reduced Iran's oil income to almost nothing, putting a severe strain on the implementation of Mosaddegh's promised domestic reforms.

2500|$|While {{lifeline}} utility rate {{programs are}} intended to protect low income individuals, many other utility customers who don’t qualify for lifeline programs are adversely impacted by significant utility fee and charge increases by local water agencies. [...] This is especially the case as many local water agencies are significantly raising water fees and charges <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>lost</b> revenues resulting from utility customers conserving water during the California drought. [...] Many local utility customers believe it is unfair that they are effectively penalized with higher utility fees and charges {{as a result of}} utility customers conserving water. [...] If a local water agency is not responsive to the needs of its customers and raises water utility fees and charges too much, the local initiative power under Proposition 218 provides a remedy that can generally be used to reduce or repeal those utility fee and charge increases.|$|E
