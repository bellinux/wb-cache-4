5000|$|With initial {{funding of}} £25,000 (£ in [...] ), the company tested the {{technology}} and constructed a pilot route at the Soho Foundry of Boulton and Watt in Birmingham. The first full-scale trial was at Battersea {{during the summer of}} 1861. A single tube was installed, 452 yards long, with curves of up to 300 ft radius and gradients of up to 1 in 22. [...] narrow gauge track was cast inside the <b>tube.</b> <b>Wheeled</b> capsules were fitted with vulcanised rubber flaps to make an air seal. Power was provided by a 30 horse-power steam engine with a 21 ft diameter fan. Single capsules weighed up to 3 tonnes, and achieved speeds up to 40 mph (60 km/h).|$|R
50|$|A spiral <b>tube</b> water <b>wheel</b> is {{a method}} of pumping water by using an {{undershot}} water wheel which has a scoop connected to a spiral <b>tube.</b> As the <b>wheel</b> turns the scoop will alternatively introduce either water or air into the spiral tube. The pressure generated from the column of water introduced by the scoop {{is added to the}} pressure from previous scoops and so as the wheel turns it will increase the water pressure with every turn of the spiral. These wheels have only one moving part and have been known to pump water with no maintenance for several years.|$|R
50|$|On the road, {{the easiest}} {{approach}} to a flat tire, should a spare inner tube be available, is to replace the <b>tube.</b> The <b>wheel</b> is removed, the tire levered from the rim and inspected for causes of damage, and the inner <b>tube</b> replaced and <b>wheel</b> inflated. Re-inflation {{can be carried out}} by the use of a frame mounted pump or a CO2 cartridge inflator. The CO2 cartridge is generally a single use item only while the pump can be used to inflate many flat tires. The inner tube may then be repaired at a later date.|$|R

The engine was mounted well forward and the rear shocks were angled to assist the traditional Packard fifth shock in controlling side-sway.

What is also significant is that Pembroke were using wheels, which were soon discarded by boat builders in favour of greased glass or steel grooves or <b>tubes,</b> but <b>wheels</b> were to return to favour again in 1885.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the {{frequency}} of researchers routing {{in and out of the}} testing site and ensure the fluency of the testing we design a new filter system applied to the streak cameras. This system promotes streak cameras&# 39; abilities on spatial discrimination and time resolution. This paper focuses on the instruction of the piezoelectric motor&# 39;s principle based on field-effect <b>tubes.</b> Filter <b>wheel</b> is driven by piezoelectric motor. It can effectively avoid the influences of high field produced by streak tube. Finally we achieve auto regulation at different gears and promote the efficiency of operations and guarantee the safety of researchers. CD 4046 introduces the driven clock of this system and we use an inverter to get two synchronous inverted signals. These signals are amplified by field-effect tubes to more than 300 V. The amplified ones are integrated at the output terminals to generate sinusoidal signal. The test shows that in this filter system piezoelectric motor operates at its resonance frequency under a control signal of 62. 5 KHz. Its working current is 1. 9 A and driving power is almost 10 W. By adjusting the gears, the filter wheel costs less than 2 seconds to calibrate. We accomplish the test in respected results. © COPYRIGHT SPIE 2015...|$|R

50|$|As with {{everything}} else, triathletes often strive {{to make their}} water bottles as aerodynamic as possible, and often to reduce the need to reach for a water bottle - which may interrupt pedaling and slow the racer down. Triathletes have tried placing water bottles in unusual locations, such as in a bracket behind the saddle, {{on the theory that}} the bottles are shielded from the wind by the body. However, a recent wind-tunnel study by Triathlete Magazine discovered that this approach is actually counterproductive because it interrupts the laminar flow of air down the athlete's curved back. A 2003, wind tunnel study by Dan Empfield found that the best configuration was a single water bottle on the bike's downtube (it smoothed airflow to the seat <b>tube</b> and rear <b>wheel).</b> This caused less drag than having no waterbottle at all. The most drag was 2 water bottles; one on the down tube and one on the seat tube.|$|R
50|$|On 18 October 2005, MCR-01 OB-1701 {{suffered}} a {{nose landing gear}} collapse while taxiing before takeoff for a training flight at Las Dunas airport (SPLH), Ica, Peru. Both pilots were uninjured. However, the aircraft suffered significant damage to the nose, engine and propeller. After investigation by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation of Peru {{it was found that}} the nose gear strut broke at a point where it was welded to the wheel bracket, and this was probably caused by a combination of fatigue, corrosion and a design fault. As a result, both MCR-01 aircraft registered in Peru were grounded by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation of Peru and declared unairworthy, until a satisfactory factory redesign of the nose landing gear was made available by Dyn'Aéro. Shortly after the accident, Dyn'Aéro published a Service Bulletin to encourage MCR owners to inspect the weld joint between the front leg <b>tube</b> and the <b>wheel</b> bracket. Finally, a nose gear reinforcement part was made available for mandatory installation by April 2008.|$|R

2500|$|Incendiary and flaming {{weapons were}} used in warfare for centuries prior to the {{invention}} of Greek fire. They included a number of sulfur-, petroleum-, and bitumen-based mixtures.

Furthermore, Thucydides mentions that in the siege of Delium in 424 BC a long <b>tube</b> on <b>wheels</b> was used which blew flames forward using a large bellows. The Roman author Julius Africanus, writing in the 3rd Century AD, records a mixture that ignited from adequate heat and intense sunlight, used in grenades or night attacks:Automatic fire also by the following formula. This is the recipe: take equal amounts of sulphur, rock salt, ashes , thunder stone, and pyrite and pound fine in a black mortar at midday sun. Also in equal amounts of each ingredient mix together black mulberry resin and Zakynthian asphault, the latter in a liquid form and free-flowing, resulting in a product that is sooty colored. Then add to the asphalt the tiniest amount of quicklime. But because the sun is at its zenith, one must pound it carefully and protect the face, for it will ignite suddenly. When it catches fire, one should seal it in some sort of copper receptacle; in this way you will have it available in a box, without exposing it to the sun. If you should wish to ignite enemy armaments, you will smear it on in the evening, either on the armaments or some other object, but in secret; when the sun comes up, everything will be burnt up.In naval warfare, the Byzantine Emperor Anastasius I (r. 491–518) is recorded by chronicler John Malalas to have been advised by a philosopher from Athens called Proclus to use sulfur to burn the ships of Vitalianus.

40|$|The {{organisational}} {{territory of}} academia has become heavily gridded by consuming requirements to produce publications that ‘count’. To survive, the scholar must plug herself into this machine – a heaving, monstrous academicwritingmachine. She must invest libidinal {{energy into the}} process of counting if she desires to be counted. This troubles us, who write for both ‘work’ and ‘pleasure’, who write to seek connections with one another, with our sense of unknowns, and with ways people learn in communities. Taking {{as a starting point}} the concept of the academicwritingmachine, in this paper we attempt to collectively explore and interrogate our own investment, our own repression, and our own desire to be produced within this machine. We seek to explore how this well-oiled machine captures flows of desire and how the vulnerability and sensuality of writing risks being flattened out to achieve ‘results’ that can be measured as ‘research outputs’. In a production of synergetic collaborative writing, we explore the innards of the academicwritingmachine, following the <b>tubes,</b> cogs, and <b>wheels,</b> the pulleys and levers, to examine the series of machinic arrangements that construct and constrict those moments of presenting, rewriting, reviewing, rejecting, resubmitting.

We take back the joy of writing, and make visible our shared attempt to open/break the machine through writing which experiments with ‘the openness required for the condition of constant becomings and the value of uncertainty and questioning’. </p...|$|R
