25|$|One {{concern of}} the pilots was that no {{airfield}} then in existence, in their view, could safely take an eight-ton aircraft. They also objected {{to the use of}} Hornet engines, because most pilots were accustomed to the less-powerful Wasps and would find Hornets overpowering. Pratt & Whitney's chief engineer, George Mead, knew that this thinking was misguided and that within a few years it would seem antiquated. P's president, Frederick Rentschler, faced with a <b>tough</b> <b>decision,</b> decided to acquiesce to the airline pilots' unanimous demand. The decision created a rift between Mead and Rentschler. Despite the bitter disagreements on design and engines, the 247 was still a remarkable achievement and was Boeing's showcase exhibit at the 1933 Chicago World's Fair.|$|E
25|$|Ricky Ponting was {{the first}} to go, beaten by one pushed quicker through the air. Gilchrist was adjudged lbw of a similar {{delivery}} but had cause to be aggrieved; replays showed the ball pitched well outside legstump and he had some bat on the ball. With Harbhajan on a hattrick, Shane Warne was surrounded by men around the bat, with Sadagopan Ramesh at short leg the man who would eventually claim the catch from a tentative prod. The on field umpires referred it to the third umpire, who took a long time making the <b>tough</b> <b>decision</b> before finally declaring Warne out. An emotional Harbhajan later remembered his father in the post match interview; his captain Sourav Ganguly would call it a performance that brought India back into the match.|$|E

And we also felt like college is so much about self-discovery and figuring out who you are." [...] He added, [...] "It felt like the perfect place to do this, but we had that line. So we tried versions where they met young and then we skipped ahead to college. And we knew we didn't want to make Monsters Elementary." [...] Scanlon said during pre-production that, [...] "Pete Docter, the original director, and John Lasseter…finally said to me, 'it's great that you're honoring that, but you have to do what's right for the story.' So we made a <b>tough</b> <b>decision</b> to just have them be in college and put that line aside."

In December 2010, she had an Achilles injury. [...] She sustained the injury playing in Australia. Between January 2011 and February 2012, she had surgeries to assist with Achilles and hip injuries. She had surgery on her left hip acetabular labrum in June 2011 in Vail, Colorado at the Richard Steadman Clinic. [...] She said of the surgery: [...] "This is a really, really <b>tough</b> <b>decision,</b> but after talking with my doctors and my family, we felt that immediate surgery is {{the best course of}} action. With something painful like this hip injury, I want to be especially proactive. I plan to stay in Seattle to be here with my team and try my best to be back on the court as soon as possible. My goal is to be at full strength {{by the end of the}} season." [...] She did rehab twice a day in an attempt to speed recovery. Afterwards, Jackson injured her right knee, requiring surgery in 2012. Another knee injury while playing in China in 2014 degraded into arthritis and required many surgical intervention in the following years, including a hospitalization in January 2016 once the operated knee joint got infected. All the consequences of this knee problem lead to Jackson's retirement in March. Jackson has expressed interest in undergoing a knee reconstruction, as [...] "I don't want to walk with a limp for the rest of my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{science fiction}} heroes have, Porter argues, [...] "grown greyer over time", Jack {{represents}} as of Children of Earth a culmination of this trend, {{resulting in a}} full [...] "devolution/deconstruction of the traditional hero". In Children of Earth, Jack has to sacrifice his own grandson to save the world. Barrowman was concerned that the storyline could have made the character unpopular. He believes however that Jack was given the <b>tough</b> <b>decision</b> on how to save humanity; the actor says [...] "when I read all of the stuff he had to do, I {{had to look at}} it {{from the point of view}} of 'I'm Jack Harkness and I'm right'." [...] For Lynnette Porter, Jack's actions in the serial make him [...] "a benchmark for [...] grey heroes"; some audiences may even view him, in light of his actions, as [...] "villainous or downright monstrous." [...] Although Jack ultimately saves the majority of the world's children and finds a way to foil the monstrous 456, the situation in which he is placed forces him to make a morally difficult (and to some viewers, reprehensible) decision. Such, Porter argues, is the mark of a grey hero. Davies stated in an interview with SFX that he [...] "loved" [...] the uproarious reaction to Jack's actions, defending the character in saying [...] "He saved every single child in the world! If you would fail to do that then you’re the monster, frankly. It’s this extraordinary treatment that only science fiction heroes get." [...] When Jack is departing Earth, the music playing is titled [...] "Redemption", signifying that his departure is also perhaps his redeeming act in the serial.|$|E
