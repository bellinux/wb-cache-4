The album {{is named after}} Ziryab, an 8th–9th century Shiraz-born poet/musician at the Umayyad court in Córdoba, credited with introducing to Spain the Persian lute, which evolved into the Spanish guitar—and according to some, established flamenco itself. One track on the album, a tarantas, is dedicated to Sabicas. The album was critically well-received; Jazz Times praised the passion and rhythm of the musicians featuring on the album.|$|E

Fox added, {{regarding}} {{the beginning of their}} relationship, [...] "It was a relationship that came out of nowhere, but the writers and the audience were so charmed by Nancy and Darren together that it's kept going". When asked if they were surprised at being initially paired up Dawson said, [...] "Yes, i was. The scene in which <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>together</b> was absolutely hilarious. Darren just looked up and there she was!" [...] before Fox added [...] "I never {{thought they were going to}} last, but we just went for it full throttle". Fox later explained that the pairing [...] "was only ever intended to be quite a short-term thing".|$|E
500|$|The {{writers and}} {{producers}} got together {{to discuss what}} direction they would take for the seventh series. They wanted to repeat the same style for series six, which was to add a serial element to be carried throughout {{the duration of the}} series. <b>They</b> <b>got</b> <b>together</b> to think about what they would believe to be a big political story that would affect politics in the United Kingdom in within twelve to eighteen months after their initial meetings early in 2008. They settled on using Russia, which was facing a resurgence in power after the Cold War, which the producers felt, in subtle ways, would threaten the security of the west. Sometime through the writing process, the producers set up a story-arc, Sugarhorse, to be a threat throughout the series and have it resolved by the finale. The writers enjoyed making the Sugarhorse storyline because {{it was one of the}} instances that [...] "really brings Harry to the edge" [...] and causing him to doubt everything he has done or achieved. The writing team took several meetings together to discuss what it is and how it should work into the storyline. Christian Spurrier noted it was [...] "kind of a headache" [...] to figure out how to [...] "weave it in" [...] to the series and work out what parts would be used in which episodes. The producers wanted to use a scene relating to Sugarhorse as the finale scene of every episode it was featured in, as the producers believed it would provide a [...] "right hook" [...] to the audience. Adding the new storyline would allow the series to return to the world of spying, truth, and who the characters should trust.|$|E
