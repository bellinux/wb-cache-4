5|$|In 2001, a {{quicksand}} predator trap {{was discovered}} containing multiple Utahraptor specimens {{ranging in age}} from fully grown adult to tiny 3 foot long baby. Some scientists have hypothesized this is evidence of family hunting behaviour, however the full sandstone block is yet to be opened and researchers are unsure as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> animals died at the same time or not.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} {{a tropical storm}} on August30, the subtropical ridge caused Leslie to turn west-northwestward. By the early on August31, the storm featured well-define outflow in all directions {{and the center of}} circulation was close to the main area of convection. Intensity estimates around that time indicated sustained wind speeds of 70mph (110km/h). However, intensification halted later on August31 as wind shear increased over the storm, causing convection to become displaced from the center. Early on September1, an eye-like feature appeared on satellite imagery; however, there was uncertainty as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> feature was displaced from the low-level center. The storm became increasingly disorganized, with the circulation displaced from the main convective area several hours later.|$|E
5|$|On 23 November, Allied bombers {{attacked}} the fortress at Sattelberg, {{as well as}} defensive positions around Kumawa. The 2/48th, nearing their objective, cautiously began to probe the outer positions, while to the north, three companies from the 2/24th managed to reach the saddle that lay below the north-eastern approach to the mission, although there was still uncertainty as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> Japanese had withdrawn from the 2,200 feature. To the south-west, the 2/23rd began skirting north around the main positions at Sattelberg, making for the 3,200 feature. After they had struck Turn-Off Corner, the infantry from the 2/23rd were accompanied by engineers from the 2/13th Field Company, who were tasked with laying down a makeshift road, over which the tanks that had been re-allocated to the 2/23rd would traverse.|$|E

5|$|The {{project was}} divided into three phases, {{expected}} to cost a total of $68million. Phase1 consisted of the prevention of erosion along the shorelines, improvements to the nearby drainage system, {{and the construction of}} dikes and aboiteaux; the work was carried out from 7 July 2008, to 14 April 2010. Phase2 consists of opening the gates to monitor river flow, both upstream and downstream, for two years. Phase3, commenced in 2012, consisted of the bridge's development and the removal of the causeway, and is anticipated to be completed in 2015. Confusion arose as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> project would be funded by the federal government. They refused, in spite of an earlier comment from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, which had hinted at a possible negotiation. Unwilling to wait, the provincial government came forward with an initial $20million on 7 July 2008, to begin the first phase.|$|E
5|$|By the 1994 NBA All-Star Game, {{speculation}} as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> Timberwolves {{would remain}} in Minneapolis following the 1994–95 season became an issue. On February 11, 1994, NBA commissioner David Stern announced {{that he and his}} representatives would serve as mediators in an effort to resolve issues related to the debt owed on the Target Center, the Timberwolves home arena. The Timberwolves ownership was seeking a public or private entity to purchase the $73 million remaining on the arena's mortgage, otherwise the team would be sold and in all likelihood moved from Minnesota. Although mediation talks were just beginning to keep the team in place, by the following week it was revealed that ownership had met with representatives from San Diego, Nashville and New Orleans to discuss the potential relocation of the franchise. By late February, New Orleans emerged as the likely city for the team to relocate to if a deal could not be reached to keep the team in Minneapolis. This became the case after the potential ownership group Top Rank signed a letter of intent to purchase the team and move it to New Orleans if debt issues at the Target Center were not resolved.|$|E

25|$|There is {{considerable}} debate among sources as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> Focke-Wulf Fw 190 influenced {{the design of}} the G-58. It is known that test pilots from Grumman examined and flew a captured Fw 190 in England in early 1943, and the G-58 has a number of design notes in common with the Fw 190 that the Hellcat did not, especially in the cowling and landing gear arrangements. However, no definitive evidence has been presented that these tests had a direct input to the G-58 design.|$|E
25|$|No pilot error or {{aircraft}} deficiency was found. Flight {{mass and}} centering were within norms. Owing to poor visibility, the crew could not detect the obstructions on the runway. While {{they did have}} some reasonable doubts as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> runway was occupied, these were allayed by the approach controller's reassurances. The crew {{had only a few}} seconds to avoid the collision on the ground; they took evasive action, but could not possibly save the aircraft. They were thus absolved of any blame.|$|E

25|$|There {{is another}} theory that states {{that instead of}} a mass {{migration}} from the Sahel of people who formed the Kintampo complex, it was formed by local Punpun foragers through interaction with peoples to the north. As the Punpun, who had long lived in the area, adopted the new traits, they ceased to be hunter gatherers, and adapted sedentism and horticulture. There is much speculation by Africanists as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> Kintampo tradition evolved from Punpun, {{but it appears that}} the two existed simultaneously for some time.|$|E

Usually as the couple see more of each other the shadchan backs away and lets the couple manage it themselves. It's expected that the couple keep the shadchan up-to-date on how the shidduch is going at regular intervals.|$|E

25|$|The EPR paradox {{refers to}} a famous thought {{experiment}} of Einstein, Podolski and Rosen that was realized experimentally {{for the first time}} by Alain Aspect in 1981 and 1982 in the Aspect experiment. In this experiment, the measurement of the state of one of the quantum systems of an entangled pair apparently instantaneously forces the other system (which may be distant) to be measured in the complementary state. However, no information can be transmitted this way; the answer <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> measurement actually affects the other quantum system comes down to which interpretation of quantum mechanics one subscribes to.|$|E
25|$|Rescue {{boats and}} {{helicopters}} searched the area, including four Egyptian frigates.

The United Kingdom diverted the warship HMS Bulwark which would have arrived in a day-and-a-half, but reports conflict as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> ship was recalled. Israeli sources report that an offer of search and rescue assistance from the Israeli Navy was declined. Egyptian authorities accepted a United States offer of a P-3 Orion maritime naval patrol aircraft after initially having said that the help was not needed.|$|E
25|$|While Ruffini and Abel {{established}} that the general quintic could not be solved, some particular quintics can be solved, such as (x1)5=0, and the precise criterion by which a given quintic or higher polynomial could be determined to be solvable or not was given by Évariste Galois, who showed that whether a polynomial was solvable or not was equivalent <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> permutation group of its roots – in modern terms, its Galois group – had a certain structure – in modern terms, {{whether or not it}} was a solvable group. This group was always solvable for polynomials of degree four or less, but not always so for polynomials of degree five and greater, which explains why there is no general solution in higher degree.|$|E

Nevertheless, each event is met with police interference due to a fear of the unsafe environments that large unattended crowds could create. In the past there has been friction between members of the student body and the UMass Police Department around their methods of crowd control; students have been displeased with what they see as unnecessary force.|$|E
25|$|The {{necessity}} for a cover name {{resulted from the}} need to avoid tensions between the UDA and the UVF, the organisation from which the LVF had broken away.

There has been debate as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> Red Hand Defenders have become an entity in their own right made up of dissident factions from both the UDA and the LVF (both of which have now declared ceasefires whilst the RHD has not), although much intelligence has been based on the claims of responsibility which, as has been suggested, are frequently misleading.|$|E
25|$|A local tale {{says that}} about 1938–41, when both {{boulders}} were in place, a farmer named James Reynolds often drove {{his horse and}} cart along this pathway. Several times, a hooded grey ghost would hide behind two boulders and would leap out from {{behind one of the}} stones at sunset, and try to grab the horse's reins before vanishing. This, although terrifying the animals, seems not to have perturbed the man unduly. However, he ordered that the stone in question be laid upon his grave after his death, in an attempt at 'laying' the apparition. James Reynolds died in 1941 and, in accordance with his wishes, the boulder now lies atop his grave, his wife Ann Elizabeth also being interred there in 1967. There is no record as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> 'exorcism' was successful, and indeed, a local woman who knew the Reynolds could not confirm the story. The other stone of the pair can now be seen lying against the north wall of the churchyard.|$|E
