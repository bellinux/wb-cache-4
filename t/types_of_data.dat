5|$|Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) allows data packets to be {{used for}} {{synchronous}} voice communications. The data packets are marked as voice type packets and can be prioritized by the network administrators so that the real-time, synchronous conversation is less subject to contention with other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> traffic which can be delayed (i.e. file transfer or email) or buffered in advance (i.e. audio and video) without detriment. That prioritization is fine when the network has sufficient capacity for all the VoIP calls taking {{place at the same time}} and the network is enabled for prioritization i.e. a private corporate style network, but the Internet is not generally managed in this way and so there can be a big difference in the quality of VoIP calls over a private network and over the public Internet.|$|E

30|$|The first <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> divides {{all family}} {{households}} into three categories—all members belong to ethnic minorities, members are {{a mixture of}} a minority group and Han, all members are Han—and counts the number of households and the various subordinate people in each household in each county, province, {{and all over the}} country. The second <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> divides all family households into four categories—single ethnic household, members of the household are from two ethnic groups, household members are from three ethnic groups, and household members are from four or more ethnic groups—and calculates the total number of households and the proportion in each category. The first <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> is provided by the 1990 census in a print edition and the 2000 census in a digital edition; the second <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> is provided by the 2000 and 2010 censuses, both in print editions. These two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> published <b>data</b> sets provide limited information for in-depth analysis since in the first <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> the category “all ethnic minority households” does not differentiate between “same ethnic minority households” (marriage within the same ethnic minority group) and “ households of intermarriage among different ethnic minorities.” Thus, the 55 ethnic minorities can only be viewed as a whole when analyzing their intermarriages with the Han majority. While the second <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> displays the number of ethnic minorities among household members, it neither displays the intermarriage situation between Han and other ethnic groups nor to which particular ethnic group intermarried members belong.|$|R

25|$|The {{cassette}} {{was adapted}} {{into what is}} called a streamer cassette, a version dedicated solely for data storage, and used chiefly for hard disk backups and other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>data.</b> Streamer cassettes look almost exactly the same as a standard cassette, with the exception of having a notch about one quarter-inch wide and deep situated slightly off-center at the top edge of the cassette. Streamer cassettes also have a re-usable write-protect tab on only one side of the top edge of the cassette, with {{the other side of the}} top edge having either only an open rectangular hole, or no hole at all. This is due to the entire one-eighth inch width of the tape loaded inside being used by a streamer cassette drive for the writing and reading of data, hence only one side of the cassette being used. Streamer cassettes can hold anywhere from 50 to 160 megabytes of data.|$|E
25|$|Integer factorization, which underpins the {{security}} of public key cryptographic systems, {{is believed to be}} computationally infeasible with an ordinary computer for large integers if they are the product of few prime numbers (e.g., products of two 300-digit primes). By comparison, a quantum computer could efficiently solve this problem using Shor's algorithm to find its factors. This ability would allow a quantum computer to decrypt many of the cryptographic systems in use today, in the sense {{that there would be a}} polynomial time (in the number of digits of the integer) algorithm for solving the problem. In particular, most of the popular public key ciphers are based on the difficulty of factoring integers or the discrete logarithm problem, both of which can be solved by Shor's algorithm. In particular the RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman algorithms could be broken. These are used to protect secure Web pages, encrypted email, and many other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>data.</b> Breaking these would have significant ramifications for electronic privacy and security.|$|E

MIDI is an opto-isolated serial interface and communication protocol. It provides for the transmission from one device or instrument to another of real-time performance data. [...] This data includes note events, commands for the selection of instrument presets (i.e. sounds, or programs or patches, previously stored in the instrument's memory), the control of performance-related parameters such as volume, effects levels and the like, as well as synchronization, transport control and other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>data.</b> [...] MIDI interfaces are now almost ubiquitous on music equipment and are commonly available on personal computers (PCs).|$|E
