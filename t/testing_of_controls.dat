40|$|Objectives: In this study, we {{investigated}} whether increasing stimulus duration could improve {{performance on a}} test of attention and short-term memory in cognitively impaired individuals. Methods: A computer-generated forward digit span test was administered to 65 patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia (28 intervention and 37 controls). After point of failure, testing in the intervention group was continued at the same rate, but with an average 150 % digit lengthening to 800 [*]ms. <b>Testing</b> <b>of</b> <b>controls</b> was continued using the standard digit span test. Results: In the intervention group, 13 / 28 (46. 4 %) improved their digit span test performance, compared to 2 / 37 (5. 4 %) {{in the control group}} (p[*]=[*] 0. 00005). Conclusion: Cognitively impaired elderly participants improved performance on a test of attention and short-term memory, when stimulus duration was increased in proportion to elongation of the finger tap touch-phase previously found in a similar cohort. A possible mechanism for the effect of increased stimulus duration on attention and short-term memory is discussed...|$|E

This testimony outlines the importance of internal control, summarizes the Congress's long-standing interest in internal control and the related statutory framework, discusses GAO's experiences and lessons learned from agency assessments since the early 1980 s, and provides GAO's views on the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) recent revisions to its Circular A- 123. GAO highlights six issues important to successful implementation of the revised Circular, specifically, the need for supplemental guidance and implementation tools; vigilance over the broader range of controls covering program objectives; strong support from managers throughout the agency, and at all levels; risk-based assessments and an appropriate balance between the costs and benefits of controls; management <b>testing</b> <b>of</b> <b>controls</b> in operation to assess if they are designed adequately and operating effectively; and management accountability for control breakdowns.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper used a qualitative approach with various focus groups and case studies, to elaborate and validate the developed model through methodological triangulation. Findings: The proposed assessment model has a matrix structure that facilitates the incorporation of checklists and narratives to ensure effective <b>testing</b> <b>of</b> <b>controls</b> and its structure allows targeting specific areas of risk in the identified KYC/AML processes. Research limitations/implications: The development of the model tended to be time consuming and could explain why matrix formats are used less often and the traditional limitations of a qualitative research apply. Practical implications: The model can be used to combine various reporting formats on internal control, hence the audit effectiveness can be increased and information asymmetries can be reduced.

40|$|Investigators {{commonly}} assess intra- and inter-assay {{coefficients of}} variation (CVs) {{to estimate the}} precision of salivary cortisol enzyme immunoassay (EIA). However, little guidance is available as to which samples to use for CV assessment. The purposes of this methodological study were to compare differences in intra- and inter-assay CVs (a) among controls, standards, and/or unknown samples; and (b) between fresh and previously frozen saliva. A total of 174 duplicates (controls 58, standards 48, and unknowns 68) were tested. The unknowns were from 34 students; all student saliva was assayed as both fresh and frozen samples. All samples were assayed in duplicate, using a commercial salivary cortisol EIA kit, by the same technician with the same equipment. A priori criteria for intra- and inter-assay CV, respectively, were ≤ 4 % and ≤ 7 %, and a was. 05 for CV differences. Mean intra-assay CVs for controls, standards, unknowns, and combined samples were ≤ 2. 5 %, and mean inter-assay CVs were ≤ 2. 8 %. Mean intra-assay CVs were 2. 2 % for fresh saliva and 1. 5 % for frozen samples. Comparisons showed {{no significant differences in}} intra- or inter-assay CV among controls, standards, and/or unknown samples. Inter-assay CV was sig-nificantly different between fresh and previously frozen saliva (p. 043), with fresh saliva CV higher than frozen; the difference was not meaningful because all evaluations showed minimal measurement error. In conclusion, results indicate that estimation of precision can be achieved by <b>testing</b> <b>of</b> <b>controls,</b> standards, or unknowns and with either fresh or frozen saliva in this population.

40|$|Summary. [...] If ad hoc wind-tunnel work on {{controls}} {{is to be}} {{of value}} {{it is essential that}} the same precautions should be taken as are necessary for fundamental research. For the model there must-be careful selection of material and accurate finish. Attention must be paid during the experiments to the observation and control of transition in the boundary layer; a suitable technique for doing this is outlined. Control power may be measured on complete models of reasonable size, but usually hinge moments can only be measured satisfactorily on partial models, which provide control surfaces large enough for accurate reproduction of contours and detailed features. The great care and time involved in the construction of models and <b>testing</b> <b>of</b> <b>controls</b> for design purposes are frequently not justified when the only purpose is {{to determine the effects of}} balance, gaps, or small changes of shape. On the model scale the main object of tests should be to determine the properties of the basic control shape chosen by the designer, recognising that there will in general he differences of detail in the actual aircraft for which a margin must be allowed. Some notes are included on the correction of tunnel measurements for Reynolds number. It is suggested that the basis of this correction should be the slope of the lift curve against incidence for the aerofoil section or sections used. For a given Reynolds number and position of boundary-layer transition the lift slope is related to its value in potential flow by a ratio which can be estimated from gelleralised charts. On this basis the prediction of Reynolds number effec...|$|E

When testing code, automated tests are preferred because it enables easy regression testing. For this purpose a testing tool using a customized script language has been developed.
