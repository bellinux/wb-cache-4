5|$|The {{assassination}} of Hanoi-based French labour recruiter Hervé Bazin on February 9, 1929, {{was a turning}} point that {{marked the beginning of the}} VNQDD's decline. A graduate of the École Coloniale in Paris, Bazin directed the recruitment of Vietnamese labourers to work on colonial plantations. Recruiting techniques often included beating or coercion, because the foremen who did the recruiting received a commission for each enlisted worker. On the plantations, living conditions were poor and <b>the</b> <b>remuneration</b> was low, leading to widespread indignation. In response, Vietnamese hatred of Bazin led to thoughts of an assassination. A group of workers approached the VNQDD with a proposal to kill Bazin. Học felt that assassinations were pointless because they would only prompt a crackdown by the French Sûreté, thereby weakening the party. He felt that it was better to strengthen the party until the time was ripe to overthrow the French, viewing Bazin as a mere twig on the tree of the colonial apparatus.|$|E

This goal acknowledges the glass ceiling that women face in careers in science and in obtaining resources from grant funding to salaries and laboratory space.

5|$|As at 31 December 2010, <b>the</b> <b>remuneration</b> of ministers {{depended}} on which ministerial grade – from the lowest to the highest, MR4, MR3, MR2 or MR1 – they were at. Each minister's pay package {{was made up}} of fixed components (a monthly salary for 12 months, a non-pensionable annual allowance of one month's salary, a special allowance of one month's salary, and a public service leadership allowance of two months' salary) and variable components (an annual variable component, a performance bonus, and a gross domestic product (GDP) bonus). The annual variable component of up to one and a half month's salary was paid based on Singapore's economic performance. In years where economic performance was exceptional, a special variable payment was also made. Each minister's performance bonus was determined by the Prime Minister and could be up to 14 months' salary, though most good performers received the equivalent of nine months' salary. The GDP bonus {{depended on}} the nation's GDP growth rate. No bonus was paid if the rate was below 2%, and a maximum bonus of eight months' salary was paid if the rate was 10% or greater. In addition, ministers received the same medical benefits as civil servants. In 2010, the benchmark annual remuneration for an MR4-grade minister was $2,598,004, while the actual salary paid was $1,583,900. An MR1-grade minister's salary was $2,368,500. The annual pay of the Prime Minister was set at a fixed ratio to the MR4 salary, and was $3,072,200 in 2010. This included a fixed service bonus in lieu of a performance bonus since {{there was no one to}} assess the Prime Minister's individual performance. The fixed service bonus was the same as the performance bonus paid to a good performer at the MR4 grade.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the structure and}} effectiveness of board <b>remuneration</b> committees. <b>The</b> study provides evidence on factors that determine the voluntary adoption of corporate governance recommendations regarding remuneration committees in 2008. The findings indicate that remuneration committee existence is significantly associated with insider share ownership, institutional shareholding and marginally associated with change in CEO. Composition of the committee is significantly explained by independent directors and marginally explained by company complexity measured by geographical segments. The results suggest that agency costs and board capacity are incrementally relevant to adoption of <b>the</b> ASX <b>remuneration</b> committee recommendations, after controlling for company characteristics related to company size, governance quality, {{the appointment of a}} big 4 auditor and leverage. The results also indicate that companies are less likely to adopt <b>the</b> ASX <b>remuneration</b> committee recommendations in response to shareholder dissent on <b>the</b> annual <b>remuneration</b> report. <b>The</b> analysis then considers the association between adoption of <b>the</b> ASX <b>remuneration</b> committee recommendations and executive remuneration. Contrary to theoretical predications, the results infer that adoption of <b>the</b> ASX <b>remuneration</b> committee recommendations does not universally lead to more effective remuneration practices. Particularly, adoption of <b>the</b> ASX <b>remuneration</b> committee recommendations is associated in some cases with excessive levels of <b>remuneration</b> of <b>the</b> top five ranked executives and does not generally result in a stronger alignment between executives’ remuneration and measures of company performance...|$|R

40|$|Background: Over {{the past}} decades, {{there has been}} a massive {{increase}} in the level of CEO remuneration, which has not been in line with the growth in company earnings and firm size. This massive increase in particularly variable remuneration {{was one of the main}} causes to the financial crisis during 2007 - 2008. As a result of the financial crisis, the issue of excessive CEO remuneration has become increasingly highlighted. Thus, the regulators have been striving to come up with new regulations to align the long-term interest of the banks with <b>the</b> variable <b>remuneration.</b> A regulation that has been implemented by the EU countries to combat this issue is the bonus cap that is an amendment to CRD IV. The bonus cap limits <b>the</b> variable <b>remuneration</b> to 100 % of <b>the</b> fixed <b>remuneration,</b> with <b>the</b> exception that it can be raised to 200 % if approved by shareholders. However, the bonus cap has not been as efficient as expected. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to examine how the bonus cap has affected <b>the</b> variable CEO <b>remuneration.</b> This will be done by analysing and comparing <b>the</b> total <b>remuneration</b> within <b>the</b> 20 largest banks in EU. The investigation is concentrated on the time period 2012 - 2015. Method:  A sample of 20 banks has been chosen based on three criterions, namely the banks with the largest amount of assets, banks with EU headquarters and banks that provide the information necessary for the research. When collecting the data needed to fulfil the purpose, quantitative data in form of numbers from the banks financial reports was retrieved from their respective website. Conclusion: The results show that <b>the</b> variable <b>remuneration</b> has increased since the implementation of the bonus cap. This increase is likely driven by the increase in fixed remuneration. Another consequence of the bonus cap is that <b>the</b> variable <b>remuneration</b> has become more constant in relation to <b>the</b> fixed <b>remuneration.</b> <b>The</b> last observed consequence is a diminished correlation between performance and pay, meaning that <b>the</b> variable <b>remuneration</b> has had a weakened dependence on the performance of the bank. The results of the development in variable remuneration provide an insight about the effectiveness of the bonus cap, what impact it has had and that an improvement of the bonus cap is desirable...|$|R
