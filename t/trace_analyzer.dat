30|$|Each of the {{primitive}} accepts two parameters. The first parameter is {{the address of}} the security-sensitive variable, which helps the <b>Trace</b> <b>Analyzer</b> distinguishes different recorded variables. The second parameter is the value of the variable. The primitives vary on supported data sizes and load/store events.|$|E
40|$|In the {{system-on-chip}} (SOC) debugging {{and performance}} analysis/optimization, monitoring the on-chip bus signals are necessary. But, such signals {{are difficult to}} observe since they are deeply embedded in a SOC and no sufficient I/O pins to access those signals. Therefore, we embed a bus tracer in SOC to capture the bus signals and store them. The stored trace memory can be loaded to the <b>trace</b> <b>analyzer</b> software for analysis. In this paper, we propose an embedded multi-resolution AMBA <b>trace</b> <b>analyzer</b> that provides the trade-off between the trace granularity and the trace depth. It consists of two major trace approaches: (1) the signal monitor/tracing which provides the levels of. Abstraction, and (2) the trace reduction. In the first approach, it allows designers to zoom-in/out to preferred level of abstraction to serve different debugging purposes In the second approach, the <b>trace</b> <b>analyzer</b> compresses the traced data according to signal characteristics {{and the cost of}} on-chip storage is reduced. The trace data will be decompressed on the host for further observation and debugging. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can reach a good compression ratio of 96 % and the trace depth is more than two thousand cycles at the higher abstraction level. The SOC can be verified in field-programmable gate array.

30|$|As {{configured}} by the Driver, Intel PT notifies the Driver via a Performance Monitoring Interrupt (PMI) {{when the}} Trace Buffer becomes overloaded (Step 6 a).

40|$|Abstract — Instruction-level traces {{are widely}} used for program and {{hardware}} analysis. However, program traces {{for just a few}} seconds of execution are enormous, up to several terabytes in size, uncompressed. Specialized compression can shrink traces to a few gigabytes, but <b>trace</b> <b>analyzers</b> typically stream the the decompressed trace through the analysis engine. Thus, the complexity of analysis depends on the decompressed trace size (even though the decompressed trace is never stored to disk). This makes many global or interactive analyses infeasible. This paper presents a method to compress program traces using binary decision diagrams (BDDs). BDDs intrinsically support operations common to many desirable program analyses and these analyses operate directly on the BDD. Thus, they are often polynomial {{in the size of the}} compressed representation. The paper presents mechanisms to represent a variety of trace data using BDDs and shows that BDDs can store, in 1 GB of RAM, the entire data-dependence graph of traces with over 1 billion instructions. This allows rapid computation of global analyses such as heap-object liveness and dynamic slicing. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} techniques which automatically detect data {{races in}} parallel programs by analyzing program traces. We view a program execution as a partial ordering of events, and define which executions {{are consistent with}} a given trace. In general, {{it is not possible}} to determine which of the consistent executions occurred. Therefore we introduce the notion of "safe orderings" between events which are guaranteed to hold in every execution which is consistent with the trace. The main result of the paper is a series of algorithms which determine many of the "safe orderings". An algorithm is also presented to distinguish unordered sequential events from concurrent events. A working <b>trace</b> <b>analyzer</b> has been implemented. The <b>trace</b> <b>analyzer</b> can report various data races in parallel programs by finding unordered pairs of events and variable access conflicts. Keywords: data race, time vector, program trace, parallel programming, debugging, distributed systems 1. Introduction...|$|E
30|$|To {{avoid any}} tracked {{corruption}} data access event missed due to ring buffer overwrite, we set the INT bit a few entries {{before the last}} entry in ToPA. The <b>Trace</b> <b>Analyzer</b> scans the buffer up to the current Intel PT write position. After the trace analysis, the Driver resets the current write position {{to the beginning of}} the Trace Buffer and Intel PT starts over. Figure  2 illustrates such settings. INT bit is set on Physical Page X which makes an interrupt is triggered when this page is fully filled. The Stop Position mark indicates the location that last packet resides when the processor jumps to the interrupt handler. It is a few packets above Page X Limit as the result of the interrupt event’s impreciseness. The shaded area in Fig.  2 indicates all packets. The <b>Trace</b> <b>Analyzer</b> will consume all packets within the shaded area without missing any packet generated after the interrupt.|$|E
30|$|DTrace sets up all jump {{tables in}} user mode before the {{application}} starts execution. The application then sends the base addresses of the jump tables to the <b>Trace</b> <b>Analyzer.</b> The user mode runtime talks with kernel to enable and stop Intel PT {{before and after}} application execution. These operations are implemented in constructor and destructor, declared with GCC constructor and destructor attributes and invoked automatically by C runtimes.|$|E

Over a two-day sea trial, peak daytime seawater CO concentrations were ~ 1. 5 nM and wind speeds were consistently 10 – 12 m s&minus; 1 . A clear diel cycle in CO flux with an early afternoon maximum was observed.

Results from these experiments, described in Section ‘Experimental results’, show that the algorithm offers similar or better performance when mappers and reducers are executed in a purely sequential fashion. This first result confirms that the proposed algorithm is not intrinsically penalizing a user over existing solutions.|$|E
30|$|DTrace emulates PTWRITE by {{orchestrating}} {{a serial}} of indirect jump instructions {{in a particular}} order.

The <b>Trace</b> <b>Analyzer</b> then extracts the payload, subtract B and gets the recorded value val.|$|E

As a main outcome, monomode fibres {{are characterized by}} nearly Gaussian far fields, which are essentially independent of the launching conditions.

Transmission levels for the "useful" modes are up to 60 per cent for fibre samples of some 10 cm. Under the same condition, optical backward reflection levels as low as 10 (exp - 6) were realized. Direct coupling of a fibre to t diode laser as a prerequisite for pigtailing can result in some 10 per cent of the total power launched to the fibre.
