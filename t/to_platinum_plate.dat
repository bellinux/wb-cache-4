30|$|Following Yerokhin [14], {{in order}} to perform the {{anodizing}} process, Ta sample surfaces were previously cleaned in ethanol and distilled water and then air-jet dried. Then, the samples were immersed in the electrolyte solution and connected to an open circuit, where Ta was the anode (connected to the positive pole), and <b>to</b> a <b>platinum</b> <b>plate</b> functioning as a cathode (connected to the negative pole). Samples were treated in a reactor, driven by an electric system consisting of the following components: AC power source with variable output voltage, a transformer, a rectifying circuit, a circuit breaker, an ammeter, and a voltmeter. An oscilloscope was used to verify the waveform after rectification [12]. The processing system is composed of the electrode support and the electrolyte tank [12].

40|$|An {{electrode}} system {{to study the}} mechanism of fine microgram powder sulfide mineral dissolution was developed by using a relatively simple method that enables the attachment of micrograms of fine powder <b>to</b> a <b>platinum</b> <b>plate</b> surface. This system yields highly reproducible results and is sensitive compared with conventional {{electrode system}}s for various sulfide minerals such as pyrite, chalcopyrite, chalcocite, enargite, and tennantite. The leaching behavior of chalcopyrite was re-examined in {{a test of the}} application of this electrode system. Chalcopyrite dissolution is enhanced in specific potential regions because it is believed to be reduced to leachable chalcocite, but this result is inconclusive because it is difficult to detect the intermediate chalcocite. Powder chalcopyrite in the new powder electrode system was held at 0. 45 V in the presence of copper ion and sulfuric acid media followed by an application of potential in the anodic direction. Besides the chalcopyrite oxidation peak, a small peak resulted at ∼ 0. 55 V; this peak corresponds to reduced chalcocite, because it occurs at the same potential as the chalcocite oxidation peak...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stronger {{cellular}} adhesion on {{the surface}} of endovascular devices promotes accelerated healing of aneurysms.
