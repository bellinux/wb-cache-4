40|$|Bi-axial {{testing of}} {{composite}} structures {{has been an}} important topic in the research community for some years now. Bi-axial test specimens in the past have typically been cruciform specimens with a tapered <b>thickness</b> <b>gage</b> section. This ensures that the specimen will fail under bi-axial loading rather than uni-axial loading due to high stress concentrations at the intersecting loading arms. To reduce the stress concentration in the loading arms the intersection points are rounded and curved inward {{toward the center of the}} specimen. By having the curvature of the intersecting arms come closer into the specimen it reduces the amount of uni-axial stress at that point. In order to reduce the stress even more, tapered <b>thickness</b> <b>gage</b> section milling is required to achieve adequate bi-axial failure. In the proposed research these specimens will be modified so that no milling of the gage section is required. The process of milling the gage section of the composite laminate could inflict initial damage to the specimen which would yield inaccurate results. The modified bi-axial specimen will instead have aluminum shims bonded to the rounded corner to ensure bi-axial failure. The location of the shims was determined using Finite Element Analyses which verified the location and magnitude of the stress concentrations. The use of the aluminum shims could allow the cruciform specimen to be completely unscathed of any initial damage. The specimens are thick woven carbon fiber/epoxy bi-axial specimens which previously haven’t been tested before. Two types of geometries were fabricated, one out of IM 7 /UF 3352 and one out of IM 7 /PATZ materials, both with a [(0 / 90) ]s lay-up. The first geometry had the aluminum shims. The second configuration consisted of a smaller composite laminate sandwiched in between two pre-fabricated G 10 glass/epoxy panels and only machining away the G 10 material, keeping the composite laminate unscathed. Both geometries had tapered <b>thickness</b> <b>gage</b> section counterparts for comparison purposes. The shimmed design showed undesirable failure modes but provided a reliable lower bound for bi-axial strength design. The sandwich panel design showed ideal failure conditions for all tests. This shows that a modified bi-axial composite specimen can be developed that limits the amount of machining and can still produce accurate results. Additional tests were conducted to study the effect of stress concentrations around holes of different diameter under biaxial load. Results were interpreted with the aid of Finite Element Analyses.

This paper discusses issues relating to material attenuation, transducer design and performance, and instrumentation design for ultrasonic imaging, <b>thickness</b> <b>gaging,</b> and flaw detection at 50 MHz and up.

40|$|Pneumatic {{conveying}} is {{a process}} of transp 01 tation of powdered and granular materials through pipeline using high pressure gas. It is a frequently used method of material transport particularly for in-plant transport over relatively short distances although, with innovative designs, materials can be transported to far longer distances. One of the major advantages of the system is the degree of flexibility it offers in terms of pipeline routine as well as dust minimization within the factory environment. A large percentage of industrial systems are traditionally dilute phase system, which use relatively large amounts of air which lead to high particle velocities. Slower dense phase systems account for the remainder if pneumatic conveying systems which are designed to operate at relatively low velocity regimes. Yet one problem remains as a major issue with these conveying systems which is wear. Service life of a pneumatic conveying is dictated primarily by the wear in pipelines and bends due to the interactions between the particles and the surfaces. Depending on the conveying conditions or modes of flow, wear mechanism can be abrasive or erosive or a combination of both. The locations of the high wear areas also varies, depending on the ratio of the solids mass flow rate and the air velocity within the pipeline. In this paper, the variations of bulk material flow structures in different bends have been studied for different modes of flow for three different particulate materials. Locations of the critical wear areas with respect to the flow modes, as well as the bulk materials properties, have been discussed. Short radius bends, long radius bends, tee bends and a barrel or "Botswana" bend have been considered.

The Neutron Scattering Facility will be utilized for advanced fields of Material and Life science using high intensity neutron generated by the spallation reaction of a 1 MW pulsed proton beam and mercury target. Design of the spallation mercury target system aims to obtain high neutron performance with high reliability and safety. Since the target system is using mercury as the target material and contains large amount of radioactive spallation products, it is necessary to estimate reliability for strength of instruments in a mercury flow system during lifetime of the facility. Piping and components in the mercury flow system would be damaged by erosion with mercury flow, since these components will be weak by thickness decreasing. This report presents experimental results of wall thickness change by erosion using a mercury experimental loop. In the experiments, an erosion test section and coupons were installed in the mercury experimental loop, and their wall thickness was measured with an ultra sonic <b>thickness</b> <b>gage</b> after every 1000 hours. As a result, under 0. 7 m/s of mercury velocity condition which is slightly higher than the practical velocity in mercury pipelines, the erosion is about 3 mu m in 1000 hours.

40|$|Abstract. Lack of fusion {{is a very}} {{dangerous}} weld defect in a welded structure. Because of the notch effect, a crack may further propagate under the smallest load applied. This type of defect is very difficult to detect with non-destructive testing methods.

These targets consist of {{many different types of}} materials glued together including low density foams, plastics, and metals. To verify models, the physicists need to know the exact thickness of the targets and target components to [plus-minus] 1. 0 [mu]m. The target components are typically 3 - 5 mm in diameter and 200 - 300 [mu]m thick and may have features such as moguls or two-dimensional sine waves machined onto them. As of yet, no commercial thickness measuring machine exists on the market capable of measuring thicknesses to [plus-minus] 1. 0 [mu]m. To solve this problem, an absolute thickness measuring machine was developed that uses a precision air-bearing XY stage to scan a target between two confocal displacement lasers that measure the profile of each side of the target. A NIST traceable gage block of known thickness is used to calculate the thickness of the target. This paper describes the design and qualification of the absolute thickness measuring machine.

However, a discussion and comparison to recent work by McDonald and Rettenmaier and Heister will be included, along with data generated by Strand, et. al. Suffice {{it to say that}} the search for a way to predict erosive burning in any size motor with formulas cleanly applicable to a typical 1 D ballistics analysis has been long thwarted. Some models were based on testing that failed to adequately simulate the solid rocket motor environment. In most cases, no realtime burn rate measurement was available. Two popular models, even when calibrated to recent motorlike realtime burn rate data obtained by Furfaro, were shown by McMillin to be inadequate at modeling erosive burning in the Space Shuttle Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM), the Space Launch Systems' FiveSegment RSRM (RSRMV), and the fivesegment Engineering Test Motor (ETM) 3.

40|$|In {{engineering}} practice, {{sheet metal}} often fails after complex strain paths that deviate substantially from the widely studied proportional loading paths. Different from previous {{works on the}} ductile fracture of sheet metal, this thesis research addresses the experimental and modeling {{issues related to the}} crack initiation in advanced high strength steels after loading direction reversal. The main outcome of the present work is a fracture initiation model for proportional and non-proportional loading. The starting point of this thesis is a first chapter on the development of a micromechanically-motivated ductile fracture initiation model for metals for proportional loading. Its formulation {{is based on the assumption}} that the onset of fracture is imminent with the formation of a primary or secondary band of localization. Motivated by the results from a thorough unit cell analysis, it is assumed that fracture initiates after proportional loading if the linear combination of the Hosford equivalent stress and the normal stress acting on the plane of maximum shear reaches a critical value. A comprehensive fracture initiation model is then obtained after transforming the localization criterion from the stress space to the space of equivalent plastic strain, stress triaxiality and Lode angle parameter using the material's isotropic hardening law. Experimental results are presented for three different advanced high strength steels. For each material, the onset of fracture is characterized for five distinct stress states, including butterfly shear, notched tension, tension with a central hole, and punch experiments. The comparison of model predictions with the experimental results demonstrates that the proposed Hosford-Coulomb model can predict with satisfactory accuracy the instant of ductile fracture initiation in advanced high strength steels. In a subsequent chapter, experimental methods are developed to perform compression tension experiments. In addition, a finite strain constitutive model is proposed combining a Swift-Voce isotropic hardening law with two Frederick-Armstrong kinematic hardening rules and a Yoshida-Uemori type of hardening stagnation approach. The plasticity model parameters are identified from uniaxial tension-compression stress-strain curve measurements and finite element simulations of compression-tension experiments on notched specimens. The model predictions are validated through comparison with experimentally-measured load-displacement curves up to the onset of fracture, local surface strain measurements and longitudinal thickness profiles. The extracted loading paths to fracture show a significant increase in ductility as a function of the compressive pre-strain. The Hosford-Coulomb model is therefore integrated into a non-linear damage indicator modeling framework to provide a phenomenological description of the experimental results for monotonic and reverse loading. Another extension of the modeling framework is presented in a third chapter inspired by the results from loss of ellipticity analysis. It is demonstrated that the Hosford-Coulomb model can also be expressed in terms of a stress-state dependent critical hardening rate. Moreover, it is shown that the critical hardening rate approach provides accurate predictions of the instant of fracture initiation for both proportional and non-proportional loading conditions. Enhancements of the finite strain constitutive model are also proposed to enable a fast identification of all model parameters. The plasticity model parameters are identified from stress-strain curve measurements from shear loading reversal on specimens with a uniform <b>thickness</b> reduced <b>gage</b> section. The model is used to estimate the local strain and stress fields in fracture experiments after shear reversal. The extracted loading paths to fracture show a significant increase in ductility as a function of the strain at shear reversal, a feature that is readily predicted by the prosed critical hardening rate model. by Stephane Marcadet.
