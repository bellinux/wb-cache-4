40|$|BaTiO 3 powders {{with various}} {{crystallite}} sizes, which were prepared through microemulsion-mediated synthesis, were thoroughly studied by Raman spectroscopy. Clear {{evidence for the}} presence of the tetragonal phase was found for ultrafine powders with an average crystallite size above 30 run. The lifetime of phonons that are specifically assigned to the tetragonal phase decreased with decreasing crystallite size below a critical size of 100 mn. In particles as fine as 100 nm, the short mean free path of phonons, mainly due to internal pressure, causes decoupling of the coupled A, (TO) phonons and a diffuse phase transition behaviour (T-c = 115 degrees C). Coupled A(1) (TO) phonons, which give a spectral dip at around 180 cm(- 1) and a lesser extent of diffuseness, were revealed for powders consisting of particles as large as 0. 17 gm (Tc = 123 degrees C). Further coarsening upon annealing induced the formation of aggregates, resulting in the shift of phase transition points to higher temperatures for the rhombohedral to orthorhombic and the orthorhombic to <b>tetragonal</b> <b>transitions</b> and to lower temperatures for the <b>tetragonal</b> to cubic <b>transition,</b> respectively.

From the energetic point of view, we have studied the possibility of the electronically stable alloys having a tetragonal phase lower in energy compared to the respective cubic phase. A large number of the magnetic alloys is found to have the cubic phase as their ground state. On the other hand, for another class of alloys, the tetragonal phase has been found to have lower energy compared to the cubic phase. Further, we find that the values of tetragonal shear constant show a consistent trend : a high positive value for materials not prone to <b>tetragonal</b> <b>transition</b> and low or negative for others.

40|$|We {{study the}} origin of the cubic to tetragonal and tetragonal to monoclinic {{structural}} transitions in KCrF 3, and the associated change in orbital order, paying particular attention to the relevance of super-exchange in both phases. We show that super-exchange is not the main mechanism driving these transitions. Specifically, it is not strong enough to be responsible for the high-temperature cubic to <b>tetragonal</b> <b>transition</b> and does not yield the type of orbital order observed in the monoclinic phase. The energy difference between the tetragonal and the monoclinic structure is tiny, and most likely results from the interplay between volume, covalency, and localization effects. The transition is rather driven by Slater exchange than super-exchange. Nevertheless, once the monoclinic distortions are present, super-exchange helps in stabilizing the low symmetry structure.

40|$|We demonstrate, using T= 0 first {{principles}} total energy calculations, that observed pressure-driven anomalies {{in the entire}} 122 -pnictides family (AFe_ 2 As_ 2; A = alkali earth element Ca, Sr, Ba) {{can be understood as}} consequences of Lifshitz transitions (LTs) Lifshitz 60. Our results for energy band dispersions and spectra, lattice parameters, enthalpies, magnetism, and elastic constants over a wide range of hydrostatic pressure provide a coherent understanding of multiple transitions in these compounds, namely, enthalpic, magnetic and tetragonal (T) - collapsed <b>tetragonal</b> (cT) <b>transitions.</b> In particular, the T-cT transition and anomalies in lattice parameters and elastic properties, observed at finite temperatures, are interpreted as arising from proximity to T= 0 Lifshitz transitions, wherein pressure causes non-trivial changes in the Fermi surface topology in these materials...|$|R
