500|$|A new freshman, David Banks, wrote {{a letter}} to his mother about his {{experience}} in trying out for the football team in the fall of 1901:"I am not sure whether I ought to play football or not. ... I put on Tom's suit one night and went down to the field to meet Yost and a few other men. They made me run around the track a couple times to <b>try</b> <b>my</b> wind. Then they rolled me around the ground and sat on me a while. I did not understand the necessity of all they did to me, but the boys say every great player must begin that way." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Winds of Winter" [...] was {{directed}} by Miguel Sapochnik. He previously directed the fifth season episodes [...] "The Gift" [...] and [...] "Hardhome", and the sixth season episode [...] "Battle of the Bastards". In an interview, Sapochnik spoke about the scenes {{at the beginning of}} the episode, which mostly lacked any dialogue, saying [...] "Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of smart and witty dialogue. This is something that Game of Thrones is probably quite famous for and rightly so, but I love non-verbal film making more than anything probably." [...] He continued by drawing a comparison to the film Heat starring Robert DeNiro, noting [...] "To me, this is truly wonderful filmmaking. And so any opportunity I can get to <b>try</b> <b>my</b> hand at that I welcome. From that perspective, I really hit the jackpot this year and I'm very grateful." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1991 Miguel {{released}} his eighth studio album, Romance, {{a collection of}} classic boleros, the oldest of which originated in the 1940s. The album, which was produced by Armando Manzanero and arranged by Bebu Silvetti, was a commercial success in Latin America and sold over seven million copies worldwide. It revived interest in the bolero genre {{and was the first}} record by a Spanish-speaking artist to be certified gold in Brazil, Taiwan, and the United States. In spite of the album's success, Miguel did not want to release a follow-up record that was similar to Romance. When asked why he chose not to record more boleros, he replied [...] "I wanted to <b>try</b> <b>my</b> music, just forgetting a little bit about those boleros that everyone knows". He began working with the composers for the album a year before recording in a studio in 1992; in Miguel's words, he wanted to [...] "discuss the works, the themes, and melodies;...The creation of an album has to be part of me or else I {{would not be able to}} interpret it, or sing in it".|$|E

500|$|Boyd is {{generally}} deployed as a winger, {{and has been}} used on the left-wing throughout {{the majority of his}} career. He has described himself as a winger, but has stated that he prefers to play [...] "in the hole" [...] because the position allows him to get more time on the ball. He has expressed his willingness to [...] "play anywhere" [...] to help the team, believing his versatility across the midfield and attacking areas to be one of his main strong-points. He said [...] "I have played {{on both sides of the}} park and will always <b>try</b> <b>my</b> best to do a good job regardless of where the manager plays me". Under former Peterborough United manager, Jim Gannon, Boyd was given a [...] "free-role", essentially playing across the midfield and behind the strikers. Gannon said [...] "if we can get him free in attacking areas he can be a great creative force". Gannon believes that Boyd is at his best when he [...] "is saved from doing defensive work that wingers may have to do", and as a result, during Gannon's short spell at Peterborough, was deployed just behind the strikers as part of a 3–4–1–2 formation. Boyd has also been used as a striker by manager Mark Stimson during the first half of Stevenage's 2006–07 campaign. He is predominantly left-footed, and scores the majority of his goals with his left-foot, but is also comfortable using his right. Kieran Trippier, Boyd's teammate at Burnley, said of Boyd: [...] "He's great to play with, with a good left foot and a great engine".|$|E
500|$|Jackson has had {{multiple}} injuries. In 2008, after the Olympics, she had surgery to fix her ankle. In 2009, {{she had two}} stress fractures in her back. In December 2010, she had an Achilles injury. [...] She sustained the injury playing in Australia. Between January 2011 and February 2012, she had surgeries to assist with Achilles and hip injuries. She had surgery on her left hip acetabular labrum in June 2011 in Vail, Colorado at the Richard Steadman Clinic. [...] She said of the surgery: [...] "This is a really, really tough decision, but after talking with my doctors and my family, we felt that immediate surgery is {{the best course of}} action. With something painful like this hip injury, I want to be especially proactive. I plan to stay in Seattle to be here with my team and <b>try</b> <b>my</b> best to be back on the court as soon as possible. My goal is to be at full strength {{by the end of the}} season." [...] She did rehab twice a day in an attempt to speed recovery. Afterwards, Jackson injured her right knee, requiring surgery in 2012. Another knee injury while playing in China in 2014 degraded into arthritis and required many surgical intervention in the following years, including a hospitalization in January 2016 once the operated knee joint got infected. All the consequences of this knee problem lead to Jackson's retirement in March. Jackson has expressed interest in undergoing a knee reconstruction, as [...] "I don't want to walk with a limp for the rest of my life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fred A. Cornell, a {{freshman}} football player {{and member of}} the Glee Club who was well known for his intellect, was called upon to write an Alma Mater for that December 11 concert. Although the story is often romanticized to include Cornell penning the lyrics {{on the back of a}} napkin during a train ride home after a particularly nasty defeat by the Michigan football team, in reality the creation of the composition was much more deliberate. Cornell recounts in a 1915 interview with the Ohio State Monthly: [...] "The Glee Club of 1903-1904 wanted an Alma Mater, as the most generally-sung college hymn is generally designated. [...] Howard Rector suggested that I <b>try</b> <b>my</b> hand." [...] In particular, the music, which was adapted from the well-known [...] "Spanish Hymn," [...] was carefully chosen: ...|$|E
2500|$|As a congressman, Durbin voted {{consistently}} {{to uphold}} existing restrictions on abortion or impose new limitations, including supporting a Constitutional {{amendment that would}} have nullified Roe v. Wade. He reversed his position in 1989 and has since voted to maintain access to abortion, including support for Medicaid funding of it, and opposition to any limitation that he considers a practical or potential encroachment upon Roe. Durbin has maintained that this reversal came about {{as a result of}} personal reflection and his growing awareness of potentially harmful implications of his previous policy with respect to women facing dangerous pregnancies. While visiting a home for abused children in Quincy, Illinois, the director, a friend, asked him to speak with two girls who were about to turn 18 and be turned out of state care. Talking with the girls, victims of gang rape and incest, made him reconsider his position on the subject. He says, [...] "I still oppose abortion and would <b>try</b> <b>my</b> best to convince any woman in my family to carry the baby to term. But I believe that ultimately the decision must be made by the woman, her doctor, her family, and her conscience." ...|$|E

And you know I know you stole that from me, right?" [...] Rico Love commented on the recording sessions of the song {{in an interview with}} magazine Rap-Up, saying that [...] "it was a really interesting situation because of the history that was in the room and the energy was so positive. It was electric. I really wanted to <b>try</b> <b>my</b> best to pull the most explosive vocals out of them. ´ It kinda carried on the next part of the story, just showing their growth and their maturity, and making it real and true to both singers. It was an amazing energy, an amazing vibe. The girls were all positive. It was just fun. We had a great time and I learned so much from both of them during the session." [...] Love also revealed that they did alternate versions of the song for both Monica and Brandy's albums. He noted that the changes were minimal.|$|E
2500|$|Lucy Benjamin {{told the}} Daily Star that keeping the secret that her {{character}} {{was responsible for}} the attempted murder had been the [...] "worst two months of her life". She commented to The Mirror, [...] "For two months I've carried this secret and it's been tough, really hard. I've had to lie to my colleagues— all the suspects were told to say it wasn't us. I've become very good at lying! The lies went on and on. The first person I told that it wasn't me was Todd Carty, who plays Mark [...] I thought he was a good chap to <b>try</b> <b>my</b> lies on to see if he believed it! And he did. I was delighted that it was me. I think Lisa had every reason to do it". At the time, Lucy Benjamin expressed fear that the high-profile storyline would spell the end of her character, who she had thought would be imprisoned. However, in a further plot twist, Phil framed Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass), for the shooting. Subsequent storylines involved in Lisa and Phil's narratives surrounded Lisa's pregnancy. In the storyline, Lisa, secretly expecting Phil's baby, married Mark Fowler (Todd Carty), and claimed the baby was his. This secret was blown in the Christmas Day 2001 episodes.|$|E
