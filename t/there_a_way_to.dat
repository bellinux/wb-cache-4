2500|$|If {{the values}} and prices of goods can vary {{independently}} {{in all kinds of}} ways, then the classical revolutionary orthodox Marxist principle that total production prices are equal to total product values cannot, realistically, be true; there exists no causal mechanism by which such price-value fluctuations perfectly compensate each other in aggregate, so that total product values equal total production prices. The principle can then be true only in an abstract theoretical model, but not in reality. Yet, if that classical revolutionary orthodox core principle is not true in reality, then it seems to follow there cannot be any systematic relationship in the real world between the Marxist labor-values and the actual price-levels for products – which was precisely what critics argued during the 20th century about the insolubility of the transformation problem. If the Marxian product values are really determinants of product-prices, is <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> express that relationship, other than as an accounting consolidation, or as a simultaneous input-output equation? There is no consensus about that issue among mathematicians and computer scientists, although the main trend is now toward probabilistic analysis and vector algebra. Many mathematical Marxists have abandoned Marx's analysis of the equalization of the rate of profit and Marx's concept of production prices, arguing that an analysis of input-output data can straightforwardly prove a strong, robust positive correlation between product-prices and employee hours worked. They argue, with Marx, that a uniform profit rate does not exist in reality, but against Marx that, therefore, a tendency for differences in profit rates to be levelled out by competition does not exist either. Since (they argue) the deviation of product-prices from product-values is not very great in reality, the law of value is an empirical law with predictive power. At least for output aggregates, this is quite easy to prove, since net value-added (gross labour compensation earned and paid + gross profits earned and paid, net of write-offs) is by definition strongly correlated with the total amount of labour hours worked. [...] This analysis does not, however, refer to foreign trade.|$|E
2500|$|Neuro-linguistic {{programming}} (NLP) is {{an approach}} to communication, personal development, and psychotherapy created by Richard Bandler and John Grinder in California, United States in the 1970s. NLP's creators claim {{there is a connection}} between neurological processes (neuro-), language (linguistic) and behavioral patterns learned through experience (programming), and that these can be changed to achieve specific goals in life. Bandler and Grinder also claim that NLP methodology can [...] "model" [...] the skills of exceptional people, allowing anyone to acquire those skills. They claim as well that, often in a single session, NLP can treat problems such as phobias, depression, tic disorders, psychosomatic illnesses, near-sightedness, GINA: [...] I have seen you demonstrate a technique that some people refer to as Dr. Bandler's Beauty treatment? Please tell us about that. RICHARD : [...] Basically what happened is that I noticed that when I hypnotically regress people repeatedly they looked younger. So I started first thinking, well isn't <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> maintain that. I noticed when I hypnotically regressed people to before the age of 5, who currently wore glasses, didn't need them to see. So I started leaving people's eyes young and growing the rest of them up to the present and it would change the prescription of their glasses radically {{to the point where they}} could see better. And done enough times, some of them could see without glasses. So I went a little step further, and did a DHE (Design Human Engineering™) treatment where we set up a mechanism in the back of their mind that repeatedly age regresses them hypnotically; when they sleep, when they blink, all kinds of things and in a state of time distortion. And it can take years off the way people look, it also ups their energy level and in some cases the bi product [...] has been they recovered spontaneously from very serious diseases. Because they were aged regressed to where before the disease started. Now I cannot prove that but I've seen it enough times that I'm impressed with it.}} allergy, common cold, and learning disorders.|$|E

5000|$|The {{people of}} the deep {{is meant to be}} a horror story. It begins some time before 2012 when earth decides to send a manned mission to Mars {{including}} means to start a terraforming. A special drug is created to hibernate the astronauts on their long voyage. The drug is dangerous and has grave side effects. In Germany [...] "Dokk" [...] is working illegally with inhuman experiments on {{a new version of the}} hibernation drug causing even worse side effects. After finally being hunted down he flees in a dictatorship in southern Africa and builds an underground layer. Meanwhile, the impact of Christopher-Floyd seems inevitable. So he teams up with a wealthy refugee and his servants. They all want to endure the centuries after the comet hits the earth unaging in hibernation until a new civilization can serve their needs. Dokk gives them the inadequate hibernation drug and himself a royal jelly version of it that should keep his mind intact. Before everybody can be put to sleep internal riots intruders and an outbreak of the Kilimanjaro (caused by the impact) cause chaos and finally the hideout is blocked to reach the surface. Centuries later a pioneer of air travelling Jean de Rozier has made a time travel to the Maddrax era. De Rozier builds a flying empire above Lake Victoria. He has met and befriended Maddrax and cares for the safekeeping of Matjunis. While emperor de Rozier is away his power hungry paladins, ignorant children and starving peasants begin to bring another version of the French revolution to life. But it always can come worse: From a new hole in the ground close to Kilimanjaro horrible people crawl to the light. The only word they can say is ‘Gruh’ and that’s what they’re named. The survivors of the hibernation show (except very low state of decay) all behavior of classical ‘slow zombies’, including the fact that minimal traces of the drug are sufficient to cause the side effects. So people bitten by the Gruh, become Gruh. It is even worse: Animals (even insects), who feed from the Gruh or their remains turn violent and spread the infection. But it still can come worse: Matjunis and his teacher manage to escape from prison. Is <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> stop the inferno? ...|$|E
