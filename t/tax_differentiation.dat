40|$|Abstract. The European Council has {{recently}} endorsed to achieve unilaterally {{at least a}} 20 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990 level. Using a multi-sector, multi-region CGE model framework and implementing selected competitiveness indicators, we investigate implications of alternative emission reduction targets and <b>tax</b> <b>differentiation</b> regimes on leakage rates, economy-wide and sectoral competitiveness, and efficiency. For a given emission reduction target, <b>tax</b> <b>differentiation</b> towards energy-intensive industries {{is a matter of}} priorities for improving EU-wide international competitiveness (terms of trade) or efficiency. Our results indicate also that competitiveness effects at the sectoral level are highly sensitive to the particular indicator chosen and strongly responding to the level of <b>tax</b> <b>differentiation.</b> In contrast, leakage rates are much more robust with respect to alternative <b>tax</b> <b>differentiation</b> regimes...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{develops}} a two-sector general equilibrium search model where "goods" are produced {{exclusively in the}} market and "services" are produced both {{in the market and}} within the households. We use the model to examine how unemployment and welfare are affected by labor taxes in general and sectoral <b>tax</b> <b>differentiation</b> in particular. We find that a tax cut on services reduces unemployment whereas a tax cut on goods has no effect. A reform involving <b>tax</b> <b>differentiation,</b> with lower taxes on services, is welfare improving.

The present paper argues that this <b>tax</b> rate <b>differentiation</b> is an optimal tax policy if there are problems of asymmetric information between investors and firms in the capital market. The reduction of the corporate tax rate below the personale tax rate encourages equity financing and thus mitigates the excessive use of debt financing induced by asymmetric information.

40|$|The basic {{purpose of}} the study is to find a metric-variable of {{competitiveness}} for each country's tax regime and {{to assess the impact of}} <b>tax</b> regime <b>differentiation</b> across the common market.

The methods applied consist of Least Square Dummy variable models and the results from the estimations for each one of the aforementioned taxes are integrated into a new total competitiveness taxation index (TCTI), following weighted hierarchical quantitative approaches. Our findings suggest that significant differences still exist between the countries examined and the application of diverse tax regime systems results in various tax performances. Using the above procedure, we also find that subgroups exist within the (27) EU countries and that EU lacks taxation policies with common rules or restrictions.

The central question concerns why the Swedish Parliament – in contrast to the intentions of the tax reform of 1990 / 91 - has chosen increased <b>tax</b> rate <b>differentiation</b> over a general reduction of the VAT tax rate. No clear differences are found with respect to the general ambition of political par-ties to differentiate the tax rate. It is however possible to detect differences with respect both to how political parties have prioritized between different areas of the economy and their arguments for differentiation. This supports a conclusion where politics matter in tax policy and where VAT policy is a contentious matter on how to redistribute re-sources within the economy. The reason why all parties have promoted differentiation is interpreted and discussed from an institutional point of view. In particular the interplay of the European VAT Directive and rules on how to account for tax expenditures in the budget process are discussed.

40|$|Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 is etiologically {{linked to}} the {{development}} of adult T-cell leukemia and various human neuropathies. The Tax protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type I has been implicated in cellular transformation. Like other oncoproteins, such as Myc, Jun, and Fos, Tax is a transcriptional activator. How it mechanistically dysregulates the cell cycle is unclear. Previously, it was suggested that Tax affects cell-phase transition by forming a direct protein-protein complex with p 16 (INK 4 a), thereby inactivating an inhibitor of G 1 -to-S-phase progression. Here we show that, in T cells deleted for p 16 (INK 4 a), Tax can compel an egress of cells from G 0 /G 1 into S despite the absence of serum. We also show that in undifferentiated myocytes, expression of <b>Tax</b> represses cellular <b>differentiation.</b> In both settings, Tax expression was found to increase cyclin D-cdk activity and to enhance pRb phosphorylation. In T cells, a Tax-associated increase in steady-state E 2 F 2 protein was also documented. In searching for a molecular explanation for these observations, we found that Tax forms a protein-protein complex with cyclin D 3, whereas a point-mutated and transcriptionally inert Tax mutant failed to form such a complex. Interestingly, expression of wild-type Tax protein in cells was also correlated with the induction of a novel hyperphosphorylated cyclin D 3 protein. Taken together, these findings suggest that Tax might directly influence cyclin D-cdk activity and function, perhaps by a route independent of cdk inhibitors such as p 16 (INK 4 a) ...|$|R
40|$|Prepared for {{presentation}} at the Congress of the International Institute of Public Finance (IIPF) in Seville, Spain, 28 – 31 August 2000, for the session on the opportunity-equalising effects of fiscal systems. University education is nowadays provided as public goods in the Czech Republic. Due to economic pressure on public finance the trend of the 90 s became the internalisation of costs associated with university education. The generally accepted hypothesis is that nowadays the returns from the costs of university education are achieved in a shorter time than before economic transition. Additionally, {{it is thought that}} the return on university education is differentiated by professions. We aim to test these hypotheses. That is why the cornerstone of our study is the deeper analysis of the differentiation of selected professions in the current state in comparison to the period before transition. After 1989, due to the economic transition and development of the market economy, wage differentiation accelerated in the Czech Republic. An important factor in differentiation seems to be the level of human capital, represented above all by university education. Education significantly increased the chance of finding a job, as another analysis has proven. However, these positive effects of education have been paid for by considerable monetary and non-monetary costs. The paper provides an economic analysis at the level of an individual and his point of return between costs and revenues from university education. To achieve an exact but still simple analysis we take into account only quantifiable monetary costs and revenues. The calculation of the point of return is done {{with the use of the}} construction of a cumulated whole-life income and its interpolation.

40|$|Abstract. The European Council has {{recently}} claimed to consider ambitious emission reduction targets (15 to 30 percent by 2020 {{as compared to}} 1990 levels) to limit global climate change. In {{the light of the}} coexistent EU priorities under the Lisbon process, we analyse alternative unilateral EU emission control policies against their effects on EU (sectoral and economy-wide) competitiveness using a multi-sector, multi-region computable general equilibrium (CGE) model framework. For a given emission reduction target, our simulations show that alternative implementation rules (uniform versus sectorally differentiated carbon taxes) induce ambiguous impacts on sectoral competitiveness: For a uniform tax, relatively carbon-intensive EU industries face competitiveness losses, while carbon-extensive sectors improve their ability to compete internationally. Losses and gains are reinforced by the stringency of unilateral emission reduction targets. Thus, the implementation of an (economically efficient) uniform carbon tax induces structural change which inevitably goes at the expense of carbon-intensive industries. Vice versa, we find that more pronounced <b>tax</b> <b>differentiation</b> in favor of carbon-intensive industries can largely neutralize the negative impacts of emission constraints on their competitiveness, but goes a...|$|E

40|$|Micro-economic {{reform is}} a primary {{objective}} of modern Australian socio-economic policy. The key outcome targetted by this reform is increased efficiency, measured by a range of factors, including cost reduction, increased savings, and a more facilitative environment for business activity. These benefits are sought by the proponents of reform {{as part of a}} push to increase national prosperity, but concerns that social equity is undermined by it are expressed by opponents of that reform. The debate between efficiency and equity is raging in current Australian tax policy, a key site for micro-economic reform. As Government Budget restructuring occurs in Australia, demographic change (eg, the ageing population) undermines the ability of public funded welfare to provide retirement benefits. Responsibility for self-funded retirement is an important contributor to increasing private savings. Investment in growth assets such as corporate stock is increasing in Australia, however concerns about volatility of asset values and yield stimulate the importance of investment risk management techniques. Financial contract innovation utilising financial derivatives is a dominant mechanism for that risk management. Synthetic equity products which are characterised by capital protection and enhanced yield are popular and efficient equity risk management vehicles, and are observed globally, particularly in the North American market. Financial contract innovation, risk management using financial derivatives, and synthetic equity products suffer from an adverse tax regulatory response in Australia, which deprives Australian investors from access to important savings vehicles. The negative Australian tax response stems from anachronistic legislation and jurisprudence, which emphasises tax outcomes based on legal form. The pinnacle of this approach is the tax law insistence on characterisation of financial contracts as either debt or equity, despite some important financial similarities between these two asset types. Since derivatives produce transactions with novel legal forms this approach is unresponsive to innovation. The negative tax result also stems from a perception that the new products are tax arbitrage vehicles, offering tax benefits properly available to investment in stocks, which is thought to be inappropriate when the new products resemble debt positions (particularly when they are capital protected and yield enhanced). The negative tax response reflects administrative concerns about taxpayer equity and revenue leakage. This approach seeks to impose tax linearity by proxy: rather than utilising systemic reform to align the tax treatment of debt and equity, the current strategy simply denies the equity tax benefits to a variety of innovative financial contracts. It deprives Australians of efficiency enhancing savings products, which because of an adverse tax result are unattractive to investors. The weakness of the current approach is illustrated by critical analysis of three key current and proposed tax laws: the debt dividend rules in sec. 46 D Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (the Tax Act); the 1997 Budget measures (which seek to integrate related stock and derivative positions); and the proposals in the Taxation of Financial Arrangements Issues Paper (which include a market value tax accounting treatment for traded equity, and propose a denial of the tax benefits for risk managed equity investments). The thesis develops a model for financial analysis of synthetic equity products to verify the efficiency claims made for them. The approach is described as the Tax ReValue model. The Tax ReValue approach isolates the enhanced investment returns possible for synthetic equity, and the model is tested by application to the leading Australian synthetic equity product, the converting preference share. The conclusions reached are that the converting preference share provides the key benefits of enhanced investment return and lower capital costs to its corporate issuer. This financial efficiency analysis is relied upon to support the assertion that a facilitative tax response to such products is appropriate. The facilitative response can be delivered by a reformulation of the existing tax rules, or by systemic reform. The reformulation of the existing tax rules is articulated by a Rule of Reason, which is proposed in the thesis {{as the basis for the}} allocation and retention of the equity tax benefits. To avoid concerns about taxpayer equity and revenue leakage the Rule of Reason proposes a Two Step approach to the allocation of the equity tax benefits to synthetics. The financial analysis is used to quantify non-tax benefits of synthetic equity products, and to predict whether and to what extent the security performs financially like debt or equity. This financial analysis is overlayed by a refined technical legal appraisal of whether the security contains the essential legal Badges of Equity.  The resulting form and substance approach provides a fair and equitable control mechanism for perceived tax arbitrage, whilst facilitating efficient financial contract innovation. The ultimate source of non-linearity in the taxation of investment capital is the differential tax benefits provided to equity and debt. To promote <b>tax</b> linearity the <b>differentiation</b> needs to be removed, and the thesis makes recommendations for systemic reform, particularly concerning the introduction of a system of Franked Debt.  The proposed system of Franked Debt would align the tax treatment of debt and equity by replacing the corporate interest deduction tax benefit with a lender credit in respect of corporate tax paid. This credit would operate mechanically like the existing shareholder imputation credit. The interface of this domestic tax credit scheme with the taxation of International investment capital, and the problems occasioned by constructive delivery of franking credits to Australian taxpayers via synthetics, are resolved by the design and costings of the new system, which has the potential to be revenue positive...|$|R

This paper describes the main forms of noncompliance distinctive to a VAT, considers {{how they can be}} addressed, and assesses evidence on their extent in high-income countries. While the practical significance of current difficulties in the EU should not be over-stated, administrative measures alone may prove insufficient to deal with them, and a fundamental redesign of the VAT treatment of intra-community trade required. The current difficulties in the EU largely reflect circumstances that would not apply in the United States.

40|$|Environmental {{policies}} typically {{combine the}} identification of a goal with some means to achieve that goal. This chapter focuses exclusively on the second component, the means [...] the "instruments" [...] of environmental policy, and considers, in particular, experience {{around the world with}} the relatively new breed of economic-incentive or market-based policy instruments. I define these instruments broadly, and consider them within four categories: charge systems; tradable permits; market friction reductions; and government subsidy reductions. Within charge systems, I consider effluent charges, deposit-refund systems, user charges, insurance premium taxes, sales taxes, administrative charges, and <b>tax</b> <b>differentiation.</b> Within tradeable permit systems, I consider both credit programs and cap-and-trade systems. Under the heading of reducing market frictions, I examine market creation, liability rules, and information programs. Finally, under reducing government subsidies, I review a number of specific examples from around the world. By defining market-based instruments broadly, I cast a large net for this review of applications. As a consequence, the review is extensive. But this should not leave the impression that market-based instruments have replaced, or have come anywhere close to replacing, the conventional, command-and-control approach to environmental protection. Further, even where these approaches have been used in their purest form and with some success, such {{as in the case of}} tradeable-permit systems in the United States, they have not always performed as anticipated. In the final part of the chapter, I ask what lessons can be learned from our experiences. In particular, I consider normative lessons for design and implementation, analysis of prospective and adopted systems, and identification of new applications. ...|$|E
