2500|$|The Turbo-Hydramatic {{heavy-duty}} three-speed {{automatic transmission}} became available during {{development of the}} Toronado. Called the TH425 in FWD form, the transmission's torque converter was separated from its planetary gearset, with the torque converter driving the gearset through a [...] wide silent chain-drive called Hy-Vo, riding on two [...] sprockets. The Hy-Vo chain drive was developed by GM's Hydra-Matic Division and Morse Chain Division of Borg-Warner. The chains were made from a very strong hardened steel and required no <b>tensioners</b> or idler pulleys because they were pre-stretched on a special machine at the factory. Although the rotation direction of the transmission's gearing had to be reversed, {{a large number of}} components were shared with the conventional TH400. Use of the automatic also obviated the need to devise a workable manual-shift linkage; no manual transmission was ever contemplated, as engineers deemed performance to be adequate with the automatic transmission and because virtually all U.S.-built luxury cars during this period came with automatic transmissions as standard equipment. With this, the [...] time was clocked in 9.5seconds.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Dynamic {{model of}} the moving belt system with <b>tensioner</b> pulley is studied in this paper. Belt is {{considered}} elastic continuous element, and pulley and <b>tensioner</b> arm are discrete element. Considering the geometrical nonlinearity and Kelvin viscoelastic constitutive model, the kinetic energy, potential energy and work done by external forces of moving belt system with <b>tensioner</b> pulley are given respectively. Then, the nonlinear equations of motion for the moving viscoelastic belt system with <b>tensioner</b> pulley are obtained by using the Hamilton’s principle.

The hydraulic <b>tensioner,</b> chain guides, idler wheel and rear lower chain case have all been updated to resolve mechanical wear problems experienced in the early {{versions of the}} M42.

50|$|A <b>tensioner</b> is {{a device}} that applies a force to create or {{maintain}} tension. The force may be applied parallel to, {{as in the case}} of a hydraulic bolt <b>tensioner,</b> or perpendicular to, {{as in the case of}} a spring-loaded bicycle chain <b>tensioner,</b> the tension it creates. The force may be generated by a fixed displacement, as in the case of an eccentric bicycle bottom bracket, which must be adjusted as parts wear, or by stretching or compressing a spring, as in the case of a spring-loaded bicycle chain tensioner; by changing the volume of a gas, as in the case of a marine riser tensioner; by hydraulic pressure, as in the case of a hydraulic bolt tensioner; or by gravity acting on a suspended mass, as in the case of a chair lift cable <b>tensioner.</b>|$|R

A first experimental study with deflection imposed on the <b>tensioner</b> is carried out to identify hysteresis loop parameters for the two models.

50|$|The {{guidelines}} {{act as a}} {{guidance for}} equipment and tools that must be lowered to the template. If there was no tensioner and the platform moved, the guidelines would become slack and could be broken. For this reason a number of guideline <b>tensioners</b> are mounted between the platform and riser. Each of these guideline <b>tensioners</b> consists of a hydraulic cylinder with sheaves at both sides. The cylinder is connected {{to one or more}} high pressure gas bottles via a medium separator. A wire rope is rigged in the cylinder; one end is connected to the fixed part of the tensioner, the other end to the template.|$|E
50|$|Within {{hand tools}} there are manual and {{automatic}} tools. Manual <b>tensioners</b> and crimping systems {{are available for}} low volume applications. Automatic hand tools are used for higher volume applications. Automatic tools are available using a battery power source or compressed air. Both manual and automatic tools are available as combination tools, which perform the tensioning, sealing and cutting, or as separate <b>tensioners,</b> sealers, and cutters. Manual sealers for plastic strap always use a seal and a compression (serrated seals) or crimp joint (smooth faced seals). Manual and automatic hand sealers for steel can use a seal or a seal-less joint. Automatic hand tools for plastic strap use a friction weld.|$|E
