25|$|Habitability for {{hypothetical}} planets orbiting {{brown dwarfs}} has been studied. Computer models suggesting conditions for these bodies to have habitable planets are very stringent, the habitable zone being narrow and decreasing with time, {{due to the}} cooling of the brown dwarf. The orbits <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of extremely low eccentricity (of the order of 10−6) to avoid strong tidal forces that would trigger a greenhouse effect on the planets, rendering them uninhabitable.|$|E

25|$|In July 2010, whilst seeking cuts {{of up to}} 25 {{per cent}} in {{government}} spending to tackle the deficit, Osborne insisted the £20billion cost of building four new Vanguard-class submarine to bear Trident missiles had to be considered {{as part of the}} Ministry of Defence's core funding, even if that implied a severe reduction {{in the rest of the}} Ministry's budget. Liam Fox, the Secretary of State for Defence, warned that if Trident were to be considered core funding, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> severe restrictions in the way that the UK operated militarily.|$|E

5|$|Several {{conclusions}} {{were drawn}} from discussions between Patel and the CPS, Starmer said: (a) because Patel had not retained or sampled the three litres of fluid, no firm conclusions could be drawn {{about the nature of}} it; (b) for Tomlinson's death <b>to</b> <b>have</b> resulted so quickly from blood loss, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been a significant internal rupture; (c) Patel found no such rupture; (d) the later postmortems also found no visible rupture; and (e) because Patel was the only person <b>to</b> <b>have</b> examined Tomlinson's intact body, he was {{in the best position to}} judge the nature of the fluid, and whether there was a rupture that could have caused it. This meant that Patel's evidence would significantly undermine the evidence of the second and third pathologists.|$|R
25|$|For such iron-rich {{rocks to}} be {{deposited}} <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> anoxia in the ocean, so that much dissolved iron (as ferrous oxide) could accumulate before it met an oxidant that would precipitate it as ferric oxide. For {{the ocean to}} become anoxic it must have limited gas exchange with the oxygenated atmosphere. Proponents of the hypothesis argue that the reappearance of BIF in the sedimentary record {{is a result of}} limited oxygen levels in an ocean sealed by sea-ice, while opponents suggest that the rarity of the BIF deposits may indicate that they formed in inland seas.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, it is {{theorized that}} {{contamination}} could also {{result from the}} capillary migration of deep residual hyper-saline water and hydraulic fracturing fluid, slowly flowing through faults and fractures until finally making contact with groundwater resources; however, many researchers argue that the permeability of rocks overlying shale formations are too low to allow this to ever happen sufficiently. To ultimately prove this theory, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> traces of toxic trihalomethanes (THM) since they are often associated {{with the presence of}} stray gas contamination, and typically co-occur with high halogen concentrations in hyper-saline waters. Besides, highly saline waters are a common natural feature in deep groundwater systems.|$|E
25|$|There can be {{some issues}} of undetected {{behaviors}} {{in the case of}} behaviors that many people keep secret presently or in their earlier lives. They may not be as willing to reveal behaviors that are discriminated against or stigmatized. If environment played no role in the actual behavior, skewed detection would still make it look like it played a role. For environment to appear to have no role in such cases, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> either a counterproductivity of intolerance in the sense of intolerance causing the behavior it is bigoted against, or a flaw in the study that makes the results scientifically useless. Even if environment does play a role, the numbers would still be skewed.|$|E
500|$|The {{subject of}} {{aperiodic}} tilings received {{new interest in}} the 1960s when logician Hao Wang noted connections between decision problems and tilings. In particular, he introduced tilings by square plates with colored edges, now known as Wang dominoes or tiles, and posed the [...] "Domino Problem": {{to determine whether a}} given set of Wang dominoes could tile the plane with matching colors on adjacent domino edges. He observed that if this problem were undecidable, then <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> exist an aperiodic set of Wang dominoes. At the time, this seemed implausible, so Wang conjectured no such set could exist.|$|R

25|$|Grant {{initially}} {{intended to}} cross the river at Grand Gulf, but the two Confederate batteries <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> eliminated before his soldiers could go ashore. Porter's gunboats attempted to do this on 29 April. Mound City and three of her sisters were assigned the task of reducing the lower battery, known as Fort Wade. Once this was accomplished, the four gunboats moved upstream to join three {{other members of the}} Mississippi River Squadron in the bombardment of the upper battery, Fort Cobun. The latter, being more favorably sited on high ground, could not be put out of action. One man was killed on Mound City, the only casualty the ship suffered during the gunfight. At the end of the day, Fort Cobun had only a single gun still operational, but it was sufficient to cause Grant to decide not to make his river crossing at Grand Gulf. He continued down the river and made an unopposed landing at Bruinsburg, Mississippi.|$|E

The design staff considered triple turrets, but these were discarded when it was decided that the standard 280mm twin turret was sufficient.|$|E

Instead, the use of tilting technology was proposed to allow higher speeds on existing lines. In 1992, the Parliament of Norway voted to build Oslo Airport, Gardermoen and connect it to the capital with the high-speed Gardermoen Line. It was decided that the service should take 19 minutes—and not one minute more. When issuing invitations to tenders, NSB specified this time limit as a criterion, which was also the reason the line was dimensioned for [...]|$|E
500|$|Under Bruce the Australian {{government}} also moved {{to its new}} permanent home in the planned federal city of Canberra. Plans for a new federal capital had been circulated {{since the time of}} Federation, and a site on the Molonglo River was selected in 1913. Design and construction had proceeded slowly due to World War I as well as funding and management problems. Bruce was a committed advocate of the new capital, however, stating: [...] "For the purposes of Federation it was essential that there should be some central point of nationhood, suitable to Australia as a nation... and sooner or later <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a national capital, overriding State boundaries and State prejudices." [...] This came to pass on 9 May 1927 when the Federal Parliament moved to its new premises in Canberra; Bruce had moved himself and his wife to The Lodge a few days earlier. At the Federal Parliament's opening ceremony, Bruce decided that voices of the clerks of the House of Representatives and the Senate were too heavily accented, and determined that he would personally welcome the Duke of York and co-open the new building a move that was criticised by several parliamentarians. The business of transferring government and cabinet operations to the new capital proceeded slowly over 1927 and 1928. This was an administrative task that occupied a significant proportion of the government's time in those years, with many departments only very gradually transferring from Melbourne, much to Bruce's consternation.|$|E

2500|$|Although Iran has {{repeatedly}} denied supporting militant attacks abroad, {{a report by}} the New York City Police Department's intelligence analysts said that the suicide bombing in Burgas was the second plot unmasked there this year that is suspected to be perpetrated by Hezbollah and/or Iran. The report linked nine plots in 2012 in various countries to Iran or its proxies. That same day, Tsvetanov denied media reports that it was a local Hezbollah cell, saying that the possibility was not discussed.
