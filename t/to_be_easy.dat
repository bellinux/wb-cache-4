5|$|COBOL syntax {{has often}} been criticized for its verbosity. Proponents {{say that this was}} {{intended}} to make the code self-documenting, easing program maintenance. COBOL was also intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> for programmers to learn and use, while still being readable to non-technical staff such as managers.|$|E
5|$|According to Anthony S. Cheke and Julian Hume, {{the anatomy}} of the Mascarene grey parakeet {{suggests}} that its habits were largely terrestrial. Like the extinct Mauritian duck and the Mascarene coot, {{it appears that the}} Mascarene grey parakeet inhabited both Mauritius and Réunion. Both populations were said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> to hunt by capturing one individual and making it call out, which would summon an entire flock.|$|E
5|$|Ng's main {{characters}} are generally female. These characters {{generally do not}} hold the same employment; some occupations held by her characters include office worker, animal nursery employee, and automotive repair shop owner. Her children's stories are written simply, illustrated, and deal with children's feelings; {{they are intended to}} give children more empathy. The characters' names are chosen <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> to remember.|$|E

5|$|As the Game Boy Advance {{was able}} to handle newer, {{enhanced}} graphics, Ruby and Sapphire were the first games in the series that allowed up to four people to share information at one time, {{as opposed to the}} previous limit of two. However, the development team used a more basic graphics engine {{in order to keep the}} game simple and not overly confusing. The team wanted the games to appeal to a large audience, so the game was designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> enough for younger generations of children to play, but new features were added to bring the veteran gamers back.|$|E
5|$|Bulkers are {{designed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> {{to build and}} to store cargo efficiently. To facilitate construction, bulkers are built with a single hull curvature. Also, while a bulbous bow allows a ship to move more efficiently through the water, designers lean towards simple vertical bows on larger ships. Full hulls, with large block coefficients, are almost universal, and as a result, bulkers are inherently slow. This is offset by their efficiency. Comparing a ship's carrying capacity in terms of deadweight tonnage to its weight when empty {{is one way to}} measure its efficiency. A small Handymax ship can carry five times its weight. In larger designs, this efficiency is even more pronounced: Capesize vessels can carry more than eight times their weight.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the game}} was handled {{by a team of}} seven people over the course of ten months. It was {{directed}} and written by Shu Takumi, and was originally planned to be a Game Boy Color game about a private investigator. The game was designed to be simple, as Takumi wanted it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> enough for even his mother to play. While the original version {{of the game}} takes place in Japan, the localization is set in the United States; this became an issue when localizing later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious.|$|E

5|$|The Mascarene grey parakeet was grey, {{had a long}} tail, and {{was larger}} than other species of the Psittacula genus, which are usually green. The grey parrots were said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> to hunt, as the capture of one would result in its calling out to summon the whole flock. They were also {{considered}} to be crop pests and being such easy prey meant that they were extensively hunted. Coupled with deforestation, this pushed them into extinction. This had happened by the 1730s on Réunion and by the 1760s on Mauritius.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the game}} was planned to be {{released}} for the Game Boy Color, but after the development team were shown the Game Boy Advance system's screen and footage of Mega Man Battle Network, Takumi felt that the Game Boy Advance would be perfect for Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. The game {{was designed to be}} simple, as Takumi wanted it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> enough for even his mother to play. As it was less common at the time to use professional voice actors, the game's voice clips were provided by the development team: each staff member recorded every sample that was needed for the game, and then the best ones were used. Takumi used his privilege as a director to cast himself as Phoenix, however, while Edgeworth was voiced by Iwamoto, and von Karma by Sugimori.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} created by Shu Takumi, who wrote and {{directed}} the first three games. The first game was conceived in 2000 when Takumi's boss at the time, Shinji Mikami, gave him six months to create any type of game he wanted to; Takumi had originally joined Capcom wanting to make mystery and adventure games, and {{felt that this was}} a big chance for him to make a mark as a creator. The game was designed to be simple, as Takumi wanted it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> enough for even his mother to play. It was originally going to be a detective game, with Phoenix being a private investigator, but at one point Takumi realized that finding and taking apart contradictions was not related to detective work, and felt that the main setting of the game should be courtrooms.|$|E

25|$|As {{off-road}} racing {{has traditionally}} taken place on dirt track, artificial turf in off-road racing is considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> to set up, durable {{and easier to}} maintain and thus became a choice surface over dirt, with manufacturers producing parts and cars designed for racing on this type of high-grip surface.

25|$|In 811, the Byzantine Emperor {{organised}} a large {{campaign to}} conquer Bulgaria {{once and for}} all.

The conquest was supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy,</b> and most of the high-ranking officials and aristocrats accompanied him, including his son Stauracius and his brother-in-law Michael I Rangabe.

Due to the performance of many of the Gazelle's subsystems, features pioneered upon the Gazelle such as the fenestron would appear upon later Aerospatiale designs.|$|E
