5|$|Many American {{pilots who}} took part in World War II grew up during the 1930s enthusiastically reading flying pulps such as Flying Aces, and were captivated by the {{adventure}} stories, an experience that no doubt played a part in their decision to become military aviators themselves. Joseph W. Rutter, a pilot in the Army Air Force in 1944, recalls this vividly in his book Wreaking Havoc: A Year in an A-20, as does First Blue, <b>the</b> <b>biography</b> <b>of</b> Roy Marlin Voris, World War II ace and two-time commander of the Blue Angels.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>biography</b> <b>of</b> Galawdewos' {{brother and}} {{successor}} Menas of Ethiopia (r. 1559–1563) {{is divided into}} two parts, one dedicated to his life before taking the throne and the other to his troubled reign fighting against rebels. His chronicle was completed by the biographers of his successor Sarsa Dengel (r. 1563–1597). The latter's chronicle can be considered an epic cycle for its preface describing events in previous eras mixed with biblical allusions. It also describes conflicts against rebel nobility allied with the Ottomans as well as a military campaign against Ethiopian Jews.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>biography</b> <b>of</b> Macrinus is {{notoriously}} unreliable, {{and after a}} partial reversion to reliability in the Life of Elagabalus, the Alexander Severus, {{one of the longest}} biographies in the entire work, develops into a kind of exemplary and rhetorical fable on the theme of the wise philosopher king. Clearly the author's previous sources had given out, but also his inventive talents were developing. He still makes use of some recognized sources – Herodian up to 238, and probably Dexippus in the later books, for the entire imperial period the Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte as well as Aurelius Victor, Eutropius, Ammianus Marcellinus and Jerome – but the biographies are increasingly tracts of invention in which occasional nuggets of fact are embedded.|$|E

5|$|The {{first people}} {{to write about the}} May Revolution were {{participants}} who wrote memoirs, biographies and diaries. However, their works were motivated by purposes other than historiographic ones, such as to explain the reasons for their actions, clean their public images, or express their support or rejection of the public figures and ideas of the time. For example, Manuel Moreno wrote <b>the</b> <b>biography</b> <b>of</b> his brother Mariano as propaganda for the revolutions in Europe, and Cornelio Saavedra wrote his autobiography at a moment when his image was highly questioned, to justify himself to his sons.|$|E
5|$|Zacharias Rhetor studied law at Beirut between 487 and 492, {{then worked}} as a lawyer in Constantinople until his {{imperial}} contacts won him the appointment as bishop of Mytilene.

Another late 5th-century student was John Rufus, an anti-Chalcedonian priest who moved to Maiuma after the expulsion of his master, Peter the Fuller. In Maiuma, John Rufus authored the Plerophoriae and the Life of Peter the Iberian.|$|E
