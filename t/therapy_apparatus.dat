40|$|Two {{questions}} {{form the}} basis of this qualitative study: Do Cartesian notions of mind/body dualism influence the meanings therapists attribute to the body? How do therapists' ideas about the body influence the possibilities of body-oriented therapies? Research continues to show the value of body-oriented approaches to therapy, and combination therapies, for adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse. This study investigates notions of the body and the application of body-oriented techniques in talk therapy with clients with childhood sexual abuse history. Fifteen talk therapists, representing a range of disciplines including, psychotherapy, counselling, psychology and social work, participated in semi-structured interviews. Analysis of data clearly indicates that therapists consider the body and body-oriented techniques in their work, and that they are influenced by Cartesian notions of mind/body dualism. Therapists notice bodily behaviour and encourage their clients to be mindful of bodily responses. They advocate holistic mind-body practice while employing concepts that perpetuate the mind/body split. They are limited in their use of active body-oriented techniques and are careful to avoid physical contact with their clients. They want to include body-oriented techniques in their work but grapple with the idea that bodywork approaches are alternative and potentially dangerous. From their interviews three main themes were identified: safety, threat, and regulation. The first theme shows that therapists are enjoined to create safety for clients with childhood sexual abuse history. The second theme is linked to the concepts of the absent body and the threatening body. Phenomenological studies as proposed by Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Drew Leder are used to theorise the body as absent until disruption. Therapists employ a variety of body-oriented techniques at times of disruption—affective responses—to the otherwise absent body. Disruptions bring the body out of absence and contribute to the notion of the body as threat. In their performance of safety therapists are self-regulating according to explicit and implicit rules of safety in therapy practice. Michel Foucault’s work related to power and regulation is used to examine these practices. Karen Barad’s posthumanist theory of agential realism is used to theorise <b>therapy</b> as an <b>apparatus,</b> which in intra-active relationship with discourse, matter and meaning-making co-produces the phenomena of bodies. This relational theory collapses binary distinctions between object and subject, rendering Cartesian mind/body dualism redundant. The study finds that corporeality comes to matter in every aspect of talk therapy, and that how abuse, bodies, safety, and other phenomena are conceived, and intra-act with the material-discursive practices of talk therapy, co-produces the materialisation of bodies. It also argues that the particular iterative material-discursive practices and intra-actions of talk therapy result in various exclusions, namely the use of physically active body-oriented techniques. This study adds to the scholarship and literature in the field by identifying influencing factors in therapists’ considerations of the body and body-oriented practice in therapy. Its main contribution is the illumination of possibilities for conceiving therapy practice with clients with abuse history.

40|$|Purpose: The {{results of}} studies of the {{effectiveness}} effects {{on the body of}} women with reproductive dysfunction and hyperprolactinemia matched set of methods of physical rehabilitation. Material/Methods: The study involved 24 women aged 18 - 38 years who were equally divided into study and control groups. Women in both groups received complex rehabilitation measures, which included intravenous laser irradiation of blood on the combined laser <b>therapy</b> <b>apparatus</b> "MIT- 1. " The procedure was performed every day, the course of 10 sessions, duration - 20 min. The patients of the main group along with radiation listened relaxing sounds (classical music, the noise of the sea, rain) and performed their own range of therapeutic exercise, aimed at speeding up the metabolism. Results: The study found that patients in both groups of women (91. 7 %) under the influence of rehabilitation measures significantly reduced the level of prolactin in the blood, which almost returned to normal. Intravenous laser irradiation of blood goes well with listening to relaxing music and the use of therapeutic exercise.

In light of the effects of CO 2 on the microcirculation recently described in the literature, we expected this gas, which we administered subcutaneously, to positively affect the physiological oxidative lipolytic process. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of this therapy on localized adiposities. As such, we describe the method we used and report the results observed in the areas treated (in terms of reduction in maximum circumference) as well as side effects. Furthermore, we assessed the effect of subcutaneous administration of CO 2 on the microcirculation by showing changes in the Laser Doppler signal and in the concentration of transcutaneous oxygen tension (tcPO 2). Pre- and posttreatment biopsies of tissues were performed in seven patients in order to study the changes induced by the use of CO 2 on both adipose and connective tissues.

40|$|In 1932, Zinsser and Castaneda (1) {{described}} {{a method of}} obtaining large amounts of Mexican typhus Rickettsiae, utilizing the peritoneal suspension obtained by washing the scraped peritoneum of white male rats with a 0. 2 per cent formalinized citrate solution. In order to lower {{the resistance of the}} animals, they were irradiated previous to inoculation, using a high voltage Roentgen <b>therapy</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The following factors were employed: 170 kv. peak constant potential (equivalent to 190 kv. peak pulsating current); 80 cm. distance; ~ ram. copper filter; 8 ma. With this setting, 10 Roentgen units per minute, measured in air, was obtained. The most suitable exposure for the rats was found to be 600 r; that is, a 60 minute treatment time. Immediately after irradiation, the rats were inoculated intraperitoneally with a suspension of Mexican typhus virus from a guinea pig's infected tunica vaginalis, which was not richer in Rickettsiae than the average obtained in routine transfer. By this technique, the authors mentioned developed a sure and practical method of obtaining a highly concentrated suspension of specific Mexican typhus Rickettsiae which they used principally in the preparation of typhus vaccine and specific immune horse serum. The use of this vaccine in Mexico by Varela and Parada (2) and by Sanchez Casco (3) and the study of the therapeutic value of the serum by the Mexican Commission headed by Dr. Landa have given such promising results that it would seem advisable to recommend the extension of this method to those countries affected by the disease. * At the time of doing this work, Dr. MacchiaveUo held a fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation...|$|E
40|$|Objective : to {{evaluate}} the laboratory and clinical effects of combined intravenous laser therapy in young children with thermal injuries in the acute period of burn disease. Subjects and methods. Forty children whose mean age was 2. 67 ± 0. 35 years were examined; thermal injuries accounted for 25. 05 ± 1. 01 % of the total body surface area; of them degrees IIIaIIIb was  19. 04 ± 0. 85 %. A comparison group (n= 15) received conventional therapy without taking into account and correcting baseline and current hemostasiological disorders. On day 1, a study group (n= 25) had programmed anticoagulant therapy and intravenous laser therapy at different radiation frequencies with a Mustang 20002 + laser <b>therapy</b> <b>apparatus</b> (patent for invention No. 2482894) {{in addition to the}} conventional therapy. The laser therapy cycle was 6 to 16 sessions. The investigators estimated and compared the following examined parameters: white blood cell count; leukocytic index of intoxication; plasma average mass molecules at a wavelength of 254 nm; toxogenic granularity of neutrophils; wound exudate discharge time; surgical plasty area; and hospitalization time. Results. The positive laboratory and clinical effects of the performed combined intravenous laser therapy in the combined therapy of burn disease in young children were comparatively shown in the study group patients.  The significant decrease in the level of an inflammatory response and endogenous intoxication led to a rapider burn wound cleansing, active epithelization, and reduced surgical plasty volumes. Conclusion. Combined intravenous laser therapy signif icantly exerts antiinflammatory and detoxifying effects in young children with 40 % thermal injuries in the acute period of burn disease. Abolishing a systemic inflammatory response by combined intravenous laser therapy initiated early regenerative processes in the burn wound and caused reductions in surgical plasty volumes and hospitalization time, which optimizes ther apy for burn disease. </p...|$|E
40|$|Aesthetic Plast Surg. 2004 Jul-Aug; 28 (4) : 222 - 5. Carbon dioxide therapy: {{effects on}} skin {{irregularity}} {{and its use}} as a complement to liposuction. Brandi C, D'Aniello C, Grimaldi L, Caiazzo E, Stanghellini E. Source Plastic Surgery Unit of Siena, University of Siena, Italy. brandices@unisi. it Abstract For a successful conventional or superficial liposuction, {{it is necessary to}} consider the competence of the surgeon who is to administer the procedure necessary for this type of surgery as well as the physical and psychological evaluation of the determined patient. A poor result often is related to the persistence of adipose tissue irregularity in the form of fatty tissue accumulation. This complication, common to this type of surgery, has called for research to determine methods for its treatment. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) therapy refers to the transcutaneous and subcutaneous administration of CO 2 for therapeutic purposes. This treatment originated at the Royal Spas of France in 1932 with the treatment of patients affected by obliteration of arteriopathies. Recent studies have demonstrated the effect of subcutaneous CO 2 therapy performed to improve local parameters of circulation (performed by Doppler, laser-Doppler, and trans-cutaneous partial pressure of oxygen determination), and to reduce localized adiposities (verified reporting variations in maximum circumference and performing histologic studies). With these results, the absence of toxicity, and the relevant side effects related to this treatment taken into consideration, the Plastic Surgery Unit of Siena has been committed to researching the role that CO 2 therapy can play in the treatment of skin irregularity and as a complement to liposuction. The authors report their experience using Carbomed programmable automatic CO 2 <b>therapy</b> <b>apparatus</b> and 30 GA 1 / 2 0, 3 X 13 microlance needles for the treatment of patients with adipose tissue accumulations located on the thighs and knees. In their study, 42 patients were divided into three groups: A, B, and C. In Group A, only liposuction was performed. In group B 3 weeks after liposuction CO 2 therapy was administered in two weekly subcutaneous applications of CO 2 for 10 consecutive weeks. In group C, CO 2 therapy alone was administered with the same contingencies used for group B (two weekly subcutaneous applications of CO 2 for 10 consecutive weeks). The objective was to assess the effectiveness of CO 2 therapy for skin irregularity and as a complement to liposuction for adipose tissue accumulation by reporting variations in circumference and skin elasticity monitored by the Cutometer SEM 474 in all treated areas. The data obtained were analyzed statistically. Values of p less than 0. 05 were considered significant. The authors report their experience and the results achieved from the stud...|$|E
