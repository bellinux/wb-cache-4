5|$|Birdy {{builds a}} new aviary {{in his bedroom}} and {{purchases}} two canaries. He names the female Perta and the male Alfonso after his friend. Upon returning to school, Birdy encounters a classmate, Doris Robinson, and Al encourages him to ask her out on a date. At the prom, Birdy dances unenthusiastically with Doris, leaving her confused and humiliated. Afterwards, Doris drives him to a secluded spot, where Birdy lightly rejects her sexual advances. Birdy returns home to his bedroom and lies down naked in the aviary. In a semi-conscious state, he expresses {{that he wants to}} die and be born again as a bird. He then imagines himself flying like a bird around his room, <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and outside in the neighborhood.|$|E

50|$|Housing {{taxation}} {{was rather}} low in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania compared to <b>the</b> EU average <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> bubble period. In addition, transfer taxes were almost absent in Estonia and Lithuania; {{while the average}} tax of real estate in EU constituted 1.0% of its GDP, the average tax in the Baltic States is far lower than its EU counterparts. Taxation on real estate constituted 0.2-0.3% of GDP in Estonia, while Lithuania (0.4-0.7% of its GDP) and Latvia (0.3%) <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> bubble period. Given that the taxation on real estate in the Baltic States is far lower than the majority EU Area, this has created a strong incentive on speculation of real estate in the Baltic States.|$|R

5|$|The {{design of}} the house {{modelled}} on the 12th-century convent-orphanage in Aubazine, {{in the department of}} Corréze, which Chanel spent her childhood. A stone staircase leads up from the main entrance hall and a cloister encloses a courtyard. A design of five windows is repeated <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> in tribute to Chanel's perfume, Chanel No. 5. Chanel ordered more than 20,000 curved handmade tiles to be handmade for the roof, and furnished the house sparsely in shades of white and beige. Each bathroom has a servants entrance. Chanel would take Le Train Bleu from Paris every month to inspect the progress of the building. If Chanel was unable to make the trip, local craftsmen would be sent to Paris to meet her.|$|E
5|$|The register's {{nomination}} gives {{details of}} the paneling and molding <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> Entering through {{the front of the}} house leads to the central hall with a paneled wainscot below the chair rail, forward of the rising stairwell on the left. There is cornice molding and a molded chair rail with runners for the inside shutters. The woodwork in the west front room has a paneled fireplace and is wainscoted below the chair rail. The east rear room is divided in two, with one of the divisions being a bathroom. The upstairs rooms have molded chair rails and cased flair posts. However, the east front room lacks a fireplace while the western one is paneled as the first floor's front west room. The roof of the house is framed by sawn collar beams that were pegged to rafters which were hewn. The chimney stacks are angled so that they emerge symmetrically from the roof.|$|E
5|$|After {{a tour of}} the home, {{the girls}} leave the {{watermelon}} in a well to keep it cold. Mac later goes to retrieve the watermelon and does not return. When Fantasy goes to retrieve the watermelon from the well, she finds Mac's head, which flies in the air and bites Fantasy's buttocks before she escapes. The other girls also begin to encounter other supernatural traps <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> The aunt disappears after entering the broken refrigerator, and the girls are attacked or possessed by a series of items in the house, such as Gorgeous becoming possessed after using her aunt's mirror and Sweet disappearing after being attacked by mattresses. These attacks cause the girls to try to escape the house. As soon as Gorgeous walks out the door, the rest of the girls find themselves locked in. The girls try to find the aunt to unlock the door but only find Mac's severed hand in a jar. Melody begins to play the piano to keep the girl's spirits up as the girls hear Gorgeous singing upstairs. As Prof and Kung Fu go to investigate, Melody's fingers are bitten off by the piano, and it ultimately eats her whole.|$|E

Many governors also welcomed local children and other such groups on tours from time to time.|$|R
5|$|Although The Human Centipede {{is set in}} Germany, {{principal}} photography {{took place}} in the Netherlands due to the neighboring countries' similar landscapes. Heiter's home, where most of The Human Centipede takes place, was a villa in the Netherlands found by the production team. The property was in a residential area and not surrounded by woodland as it appears in the film, but by other houses. This meant the filmmakers had some difficulty ensuring that the other houses did not appear in shot. Some conversion of the property took place prior to filming, for example, a cinema room was converted to form Heiter's basement operating theatre, with real hospital beds and intravenous drips rented from a local hospital. The paintings of conjoined twins that were displayed <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> were painted by Tom Six, which he felt contributed to the atmosphere in the house. The hotel room scene near the beginning of the film was filmed in a hotel suite at a location near Amsterdam. The film was shot almost entirely in sequence, which Yennie stated helped the actors to develop their characters throughout the film. The opening scene, which only featured Laser and de Wit, was shot {{on the last day of}} filming.|$|E
5|$|Nettlecombe Court {{has several}} emblems and carvings bearing {{the image of}} a horse rising from the sea, which are the Trevilian family arms, found <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> The source story of the arms is the Lyonesse legend of Trevilian, as follows: Lyonesse were the lands, now submerged, on the west coast that was said to be the lands of Camelot of King Arthur and the site of the final mortal battle between King Arthur and Mordred. Tennyson's Idylls of the King claims Lyonesse as the final resting place of King Arthur himself. Perhaps this is why the grave of the king cannot be found, as it lies beneath the sea. Roman {{writings}} also speak of a Leonis, now submerged off the coast. Lyonesse was also the home of Tristan and Isolde. Legend relates that when Lyonesse suddenly sank, it was inundated as sea levels rushed in. The sole surviving knight of King Arthur's Lyonesse was said to be only one knight, Trevilian, who escaped by riding his white horse through the rising waters to higher ground before Lyonesse was submerged. Trevilian urged the other knights to join him in his attempt to escape, who counter-urged Trevilian to stay put and wait for the floodwaters to pass. The sedentary knights jovially bet wagers amongst themselves around the supper table, {{as to whether or not}} Trevilian and his white horse could survive swimming through the incoming flooding and make it to higher ground. None of the other Arthurian knights of Lyonesse, except Trevilian, was said to have survived the great sinking and inundation of Lyonesse. Submerged Medieval church bells of the lost land of Lyonesse were later said to be heard ringing, muffled under the water, when turbulent storms created rough seas. The surviving Trevilian became the founder of the current British Trevilian-Trevelyan family, whose coat of arms still bears a white horse issuing forth from the sea. In some cases the Trevilian white horse arms may be seen combined at Nettlecombe with other related family arms, indicating marriages to Raleigh, Luttrell, Wyndham, Chichester and Strode.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the house}} is assumed to have been {{thoroughly}} cleaned by the night before Passover, there is some concern that making a blessing over the search for chametz will be in vain (bracha l'vatala) if nothing is found.

25|$|Throughout the house’s interior, painted Elmslie-designed stencils repeat {{along the}} upper border of walls, with designs differing {{from room to}} room.

A wood decoration of semicircular design, decorated with art glass and sawed wood decoration, partially frames the painted scene.|$|E
25|$|Despite the Camarillo Ranch House’s ideal {{location}} in Southern California, {{back in the}} early 1900s the home struggled to stay warm. Almost every room in the house has a fireplace in it. Adolfo looked to technology as a way to remedy problems that would arise on the ranch. He was the first farmer to ever purchase a refrigerator, which at that time, would take up an entire room in the house. However, he was able to safely store perishables {{for the first time in}} his life. He also had multiple heaters installed <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> in hopes of providing more warmth to his family. The most beautiful room in the Camarillo Ranch house belonged to Adolfo's middle daughter Carmen. Carmen was an avid equestrian who learned how to care for and maintain the horses from the Ranch Manager, Meliton Ortiz. Up until Meliton Ortiz’ death in 2010, he would visit the Camarillo Ranch House frequently to provide stories and details about his life growing up on the ranch. The home was remodeled in 1914, when the oldest daughter Carmen married. They opened many rooms by taking down walls and changing the stair design. The grand parlor had the greatest changes from this, causing it to go from multiple to rooms to one giant open grand parlor. This was in the hopes that it would open up the house more.|$|E
25|$|Jeffreys {{was born}} into a middle-class family in Oxford, where he spent the first six years of his life until 1956, when the family moved to Luton, Bedfordshire. He {{attributes}} his curiosity and inventiveness to having been gained from his father, as well as his paternal grandfather, who held a number of patents. When he was eight, his father gave him a chemistry set, which he enhanced {{over the next few years}} with extra chemicals, even including a small bottle of sulfuric acid. He says he liked making small explosions, but an accidental splash of the sulfuric acid caused a burn, which left a permanent scar on his chin (now under his beard). His father also bought him a Victorian-era brass microscope, which he used to examine biological specimens. At about 12, he made a small dissecting kit (including a scalpel, crafted from a flattened pin) which he used to dissect a bumblebee, but he got into trouble with his parents when he progressed to dissecting a larger specimen. One Sunday morning he found a dead cat on the road while doing his paper round and took it home in his bag. He relates that he started to dissect it on the dining room table before Sunday lunch, causing a foul smell <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> after he ruptured its intestines.|$|E
50|$|The second {{indicator}} {{also show that}} <b>the</b> <b>house</b> price-to-rent ratio dynamics imbalance began in 2004, before broadly adjusted back to pre-housing prices bubble levels in 2011. House price growth clearly outpaced the growth rates of house rates and disposable income in Latvia <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> price bubble crisis. The impact of <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> prices crash in Latvia far worse than Estonia and Latvia during <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> price crash - as <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> prices outstrips <b>the</b> growth of rent rate. In Lithuania, <b>the</b> <b>house</b> price-to-rent even fall below the reference point in between {{the third quarter of}} 2009 up to the first quarter of 2010.
