25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, a British {{television}} documentary accused {{the company of}} targeting a competitor, Canadian company AES Wordplex, {{in an attempt to}} <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> market. However, the documentary came to no conclusion regarding this.|$|E
2500|$|... 1 The Green {{team would}} have {{received}} the Samadhi, but the Orange team decided to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the {{explicit}} {{shots in the}} final photo slide show in which his character is seen receiving fellatio in an elevator, Galifianakis confirmed that a prosthesis {{was used for the}} scene, and that he had been more embarrassed than anyone else during the creation of the shot. [...] "You would think that I wouldn't be the one who was embarrassed; I was extremely embarrassed. I really didn't even want it in there. I offered Todd's assistant {{a lot of money to}} convince him to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movie. I did. But it made it in there." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{a strong}} {{advocate}} for animal rights, Linda lent her support to many organizations such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), the Council for the Protection of Rural England, and Friends of the Earth. She was also a patron of the League Against Cruel Sports. She narrated a TV advertisement for PETA, in which she said: [...] "Have {{you ever seen a}} fish gasping for breath when you <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water? They’re saying, ‘Thanks a lot for killing me. It feels great, you know.’ No! It hurts!" [...] After her death, PETA created the Linda McCartney Memorial Award.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Jack did; he was {{wonderful}} that way. Mr. Turnbull {{has never been}} able to find any giants, but he means to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blacks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be so good as to {{continue}} the service of my dinner," [...] he ordered. [...] "The champagne is a trifle too chilled. You can <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cooler." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing {{like a good}} sleep, Jack, {{when you}} have had a hard day's work; and {{yesterday}} was enough to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> anyone." ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her hand, {{opened it}} {{with a kind of}} {{professional}} carelessness, barely glanced at the signature and seals, and returned it.|$|R
60|$|This, <b>it</b> appeared, had <b>taken</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> him a bit, and I was not displeased. I {{was feeling}} the strain myself, and welcomed a lull.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I'm sure I wouldn't; I'm sure I'd {{take care}} and not hurt myself. I shouldn't <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sheath much, but I could ground arms with it, and all that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I couldn't {{let you do}} that, Mrs. Maze," [...] Gaites protested. [...] "Besides, I don't suppose they'd {{allow us}} to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> freight, here, unless we had the bill of lading." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's only me," [...] said Gorman, [...] "getting {{you your}} physic. I almost upset {{it in the}} dark. Here now, drink it off. I can't find the cup, but you can <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bottle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If we {{can live}} through this quarter," [...] said The Maltese Cat, [...] "I sha'n't care. Don't <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> yourselves. Let them do the lathering." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is wonderful," [...] said Mr. Dashwood, all expert admiration; [...] "she {{has gone}} into the rehearsals tooth and nail. But nothing <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, really, it's impossible!' Ursula would reply distinctly. And so the {{two girls}} <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their {{universal}} enemy. But their father {{became more and more}} enraged.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, {{but what}} right had he {{to say my}} missus shouldn't <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parish?" [...] said Jim Parsons. [...] "We'd a {{made a couple of}} pounds more, if she'd been free to go her rounds, as Betty Blake did." ...|$|E
60|$|CRICHTON. If I might venture, my lady, {{would you}} kindly show it by {{becoming}} more like Lady Mary. That disdain {{is what we}} like from our superiors. Even so do we, the upper servants, disdain the lower servants, while they <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> odds and ends.|$|E
6000|$|The {{handsome}} Mrs. Camelford laughed good-naturedly. [...] "The artist," [...] remarked Mrs. Camelford, [...] "from what I {{have seen}} of him {{would never know}} {{the inside of his}} shirt from the outside if his wife was not there to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drawer and put it over his head." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be silly!" [...] she rejoined. [...] "He MAY {{not become}} unhappy--God grant NOT!" [...] she developed. [...] "But {{if he does}} he'll <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Nanda." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I will <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> box then,' said Arundel; and he fetched it. 'Here is the letter,' said he on his return: 'pardon me if I impress {{upon you}} its importance. Excuse this emotion, but, indeed, this letter decides my fate. My {{happiness}} for life {{is dependent on}} its reception!' ...|$|E
6000|$|Madame {{threw up}} her hands, laughing. [...] "No, no, I shall not take your little black doll {{of the four}} {{thousand}} years. Keep it for a mascot. A great singer always needs a mascot. But do not, I command you, <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> box till I am gone, for if I were to see it again, I {{might not be able}} to resist the temptation. Some day I shall show you my dolls, but there is not such a gem among them." ...|$|E
6000|$|There was a {{time when}} I was the newly {{appointed}} occupant of a college chair and had to address the Owl's Club. It is a penalty that all new professors pay; and the Owls batten upon them like bats. It is one of the compensations of age that I am free of the Owl's Club forever. But in the days when I still had to address them, I used to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Owls in a speech, delivered, in imagination only and not out loud, to the assembled meeting of the seventeen Owls, after the chairman had made his concluding remarks. It ran as follows: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I {{suppose they}} <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the bag at St. Gian, and forgot to pack it again. It was {{probably}} flung away as of no account." ...|$|R
60|$|LIZA [who has {{disposed}} of the chocolate after being nearly choked by it] I wouldn't have ate it, only I'm too ladylike to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my mouth.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll soon tell you," [...] said John. [...] "First, however, let's {{get this}} {{business}} of the kid's rent settled. <b>Take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this and give me the receipt." ...|$|R
60|$|It is true, {{people used}} all {{possible}} precaution. When any one bought a joint of {{meat in the}} market, they[132] would not <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> butcher's hand, but took it off the hooks themselves.[132] On the other hand, the butcher would not touch the money, but have it put into a pot full of vinegar, which he kept for that purpose. The buyer carried always small money to make up any odd sum, that they might take no change. They carried bottles for scents and perfumes in their hands, and all the means {{that could be used}} were employed; but then the poor could not do even these things, and they went at all hazards.|$|E
60|$|The {{professor}} {{decided to}} take a chance: and he failed miserably. As I was on the green with my third, and, unless I putted extremely poorly, was morally certain to be down in five, which is bogey for the hole, there was not much practical use in his continuing to struggle. But he did in a spirit of pure vindictiveness, {{as if he were trying}} to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ball. It was a grisly sight to see him, head and shoulders above the ditch, hewing at his obstinate colonel. It was a similar spectacle that once induced a lay spectator of a golf match to observe that he considered hockey a silly game.|$|E
60|$|When the bathing master {{reached a}} point {{opposite}} the imperilled swimmers, he was obliged to wait a little for the life-line, {{but as soon as}} it reached him he tied one end of it around his waist and plunged into the surf. The men who had brought the line did not uncoil it nor even <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> box, and very soon it was seen that the bathing-master was not only making his way bravely through the breakers, but was towing after him the coil of rope, and the box in which it had been entangled. As soon as he perceived this, the man stopped for an instant, jerked the line from his waist and swam away without it.|$|E
6000|$|MAGISTRATE. [Hissing, with {{protruded}} neck.] You <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> spite? Well now, that's something! But do {{you imagine}} {{you can go}} about the town taking things <b>out</b> <b>of</b> spite? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, at {{all events}} there's some comfort in that. If I {{am going to}} be done <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my night's rest, I should like to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> someone.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Briskly.] Well, at {{all events}} that's some comfort. If I {{am going to}} be done <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my night's rest, I should like to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> some one.|$|R
