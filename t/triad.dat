30|$|This article {{argues for}} the {{importance}} of forbidden <b>triads</b> – open <b>triads</b> with high-weight edges – in predicting success in creative fields. Forbidden <b>triads</b> had been treated as a residual category beyond closed and open <b>triads,</b> yet I argue that these structures provide opportunities to combine socially evolved styles in new ways. Using data on the entire history of recorded jazz from 1896 to 2010, I show that observed collaborations have tolerated the openness of high weight <b>triads</b> more than expected, observed jazz sessions had more forbidden <b>triads</b> than expected, and the density of forbidden <b>triads</b> contributed to the success of recording sessions, measured by the number of record releases of session material. The article also shows that the sessions of Miles Davis had received an especially high boost from forbidden <b>triads.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Lisica and Mardesic {{introduced}} {{the notion of}} coherent ex-pansion of a space to develop a strong shape theory for arbitrary topologi-cal spaces. Mardesic then {{introduced the}} notion of strong ANR-expansion of a space, which is an intermediate notion between ANR-resolution and ANR-expansion, and showed that this notion {{can be used to}} dene the same strong shape category. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to generalize those notions to <b>triads</b> of spaces and show that resolutions of <b>triads</b> are strong expansions of <b>triads</b> and that strong expansions of <b>triads</b> are co-herent expansions of <b>triads.</b> Hence the strong shape theory for <b>triads</b> is well-de ned, and all notions and results on strong expansions generalize to <b>triads</b> of spaces. As an invariant, strong homotopy groups for <b>triads</b> are de ned, and the excision property with respect to strong homotopy groups and Mayer-Vietoris sequences for strong homology groups are discussed. 1...|$|R

5|$|The {{second most}} studied <b>triad</b> is the Cysteine-Histidine-Aspartate motif. Several {{families}} of cysteine proteases use this <b>triad</b> set, for example TEV protease and papain. The <b>triad</b> acts similarly to serine protease triads, {{with a few}} notable differences. Due to cysteine's low pKa, {{the importance of the}} Asp to catalysis varies and several cysteine proteases are effectively Cys-His dyads (e.g. hepatitis A virus protease), whilst in others the cysteine is already deprotonated before catalysis begins (e.g. papain). This <b>triad</b> is also used by some amidases, such as N-glycanase to hydrolyse non-peptide C-N bonds.|$|E
30|$|The {{coefficient}} {{of the first}} power of forbidden <b>triads</b> density is positive and significant, while the second power is negative and significant. This suggests that – compared to open <b>triads</b> – an increase in forbidden <b>triads</b> can initially be more beneficial {{for the number of}} releases. The density of closed <b>triads</b> is not different from open <b>triads</b> with regards to releases. These findings are consistent across all four models, with or without band leader fixed effects, and with OLS and NB specifications.|$|R
30|$|Both in the {{observed}} and simulated data about 9 % of <b>triads</b> are forbidden ones: <b>triads</b> with high edge weights without closure. In {{the observed}} data {{it seems that}} the number of forbidden <b>triads</b> is limited {{by the fact that the}} edge weights are relatively high, and high edge weight is correlated with closure as well. In the rewired data the number of forbidden <b>triads</b> seems to be limited by the fact that while most <b>triads</b> are open, the average edge weight is small.|$|R

5|$|The <b>triad</b> of {{cytomegalovirus}} protease uses histidine as {{both the}} acid and base <b>triad</b> members. Removing the acid histidine results in only a 10-fold activity loss (compared to >10,000-fold when aspartate is removed from chymotrypsin). This <b>triad</b> has been interpreted as a possible way of generating a less active enzyme to control cleavage rate.|$|E
5|$|A {{catalytic}} <b>triad</b> {{refers to}} the three amino acid residues that function together at {{the centre of the}} active site of some hydrolase and transferase enzymes (e.g. proteases, amidases, esterases, acylases, lipases and β-lactamases). An Acid-Base-Nucleophile <b>triad</b> is a common motif for generating a nucleophilic residue for covalent catalysis. The residues form a charge-relay network to polarise and activate the nucleophile, which attacks the substrate, forming a covalent intermediate which is then hydrolysed to regenerate free enzyme and release the product. The nucleophile is most commonly a serine or cysteine amino acid, but occasionally threonine. Because enzymes fold into complex three-dimensional structures, the residues of a catalytic <b>triad</b> can be far from each other along the amino-acid sequence (primary structure), however, they are brought close together in the final fold.|$|E

40|$|Golay <b>triads</b> were {{introduced}} by Frank in 1980, but {{have since been}} largely overlooked. This thesis gives the first complete counts of 3 -phase Golay sequence <b>triads</b> of length at most 22.

The existence pattern revealed is surprisingly rich, and leads to the conjecture: there are no 3 -phase Golay sequence <b>triads</b> of length congruent to 4 modulo 6. This thesis also studies the structure of 3 -phase Golay sequence <b>triads.</b> Four transformations are defined that induce an equivalence relation {{on the set of}} 3 -phase Golay sequence <b>triads</b> of a given length. Moreover, a construction for Golay sequence <b>triads</b> due to Frank is generalized to multiple dimensions.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of a reflexivity manipulation on the performance of dyads and <b>triads</b> working on an intellective task known as letters-to-numbers. Past research has shown <b>triads</b> consistently outperforming dyads on this task. The current study sought to determine whether giving dyads an opportunity to reflect on strategy would close this gap in performance. Participants performed a computerized version of two letters-to-numbers problems in dyads or <b>triads.</b> Between problems, half of the groups performed a reflexivity task designed to facilitate strategy improvements. Experimental sessions were videotaped. It was predicted that <b>triads</b> would outperform dyads, reflexivity groups would outperform control groups, and that this improvement would be greater for dyads than for <b>triads.</b> Results contradicted expectations. <b>Triads</b> in the reflexivity condition performed worse than those in the control condition.

5|$|The acidic <b>triad</b> member forms a {{hydrogen}} {{bond with the}} basic residue. This aligns the basic residue by restricting its side-chain rotation, and polarises it by stabilising its positive charge. Two amino acids have acidic side chains at physiological pH (aspartate or glutamate) {{and so are the}} most commonly used for this <b>triad</b> member. Cytomegalovirus protease uses a pair of histidines, one as the base, as usual, and one as the acid. The second histidine is not as effective an acid as the more common aspartate or glutamate, leading to a lower catalytic efficiency. In some enzymes, the acid member of the <b>triad</b> is less necessary and some act only as a dyad. For example, papain uses asparagine as its third <b>triad</b> member which orients the histidine base but does not act as an acid. Similarly, hepatitis A virus protease contains an ordered water in the position where an acid residue should be.|$|E
5|$|The {{enzymology}} of proteases {{provides some}} of the clearest known examples of convergent evolution. The same geometric arrangement of <b>triad</b> residues occurs in over 20 separate enzyme superfamilies. Each of these superfamilies is the result of convergent evolution for the same <b>triad</b> arrangement within a different structural fold. This is because there are limited productive ways to arrange three <b>triad</b> residues, the enzyme backbone and the substrate. These examples reflect the intrinsic chemical and physical constraints on enzymes, leading evolution to repeatedly and independently converge on equivalent solutions.|$|E
5|$|This unusual <b>triad</b> occurs only in one {{superfamily}} of amidases. In this case, the lysine acts to polarise {{the middle}} serine. The middle serine then forms two strong hydrogen bonds to the nucleophilic serine to activate it (one {{with the side}} chain hydroxyl {{and the other with}} the backbone amide). The middle serine is held in an unusual cis orientation to facilitate precise contacts with the other two <b>triad</b> residues. The <b>triad</b> is further unusual in that the lysine and cis-serine both act as the base in activating the catalytic serine, but the same lysine also performs the role of the acid member as well as making key structural contacts.|$|E
