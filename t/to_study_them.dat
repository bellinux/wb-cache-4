25|$|The above {{fact about}} {{existence}} of nonconstant meromorphic functions {{can be used}} to show that any compact Riemann surface is a projective variety, i.e. can be given by polynomial equations inside a projective space. Actually, it can be shown that every compact Riemann surface can be embedded into complex projective 3-space. This is a surprising theorem: Riemann surfaces are given by locally patching charts. If one global condition, namely compactness, is added, the surface is necessarily algebraic. This feature of Riemann surfaces allows one <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>them</b> with either the means of analytic or algebraic geometry. The corresponding statement for higher-dimensional objects is false, i.e. there are compact complex 2-manifolds which are not algebraic. On the other hand, every projective complex manifold is necessarily algebraic, see Chow's theorem.|$|E

25|$|When a young Roman {{inadvertently}} {{fell through}} a cleft in the Esquiline hillside {{at the end}} of the 15th century, he found himself in a strange cave or grotta filled with painted figures. Soon the young artists of Rome were having themselves let down on boards knotted to ropes to see for themselves. The fourth style frescoes that were uncovered then have faded to pale gray stains on the plaster now, but the effect of these freshly rediscovered grottesche decorations was electrifying in the early Renaissance, which was just arriving in Rome.

After a long wait he was able to get a job in the film developing department of Shinkō Kinema, which he joined because he was too short to join the lighting department. He was one of eleven workers in the developing department, but only three of them actually worked, the others being members of the company baseball team. At this time he learned that films were based on scripts because old scripts were used as toilet paper. He would take the scripts home <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>them.</b> His job involved drying 200-foot lengths of film on a roller three metres long and two metres high, and he learned the relationship between the pieces of film he was drying and the scripts he read.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{argues that}} the {{relatively}} new field of personnel economics holds strong potential {{as a tool for}} studying public sector workforces. This sub-field of labor economics is based on a strong foundation of microeconomics which provides a robust theoretical foundation for studying workforce and organizational design issues. Personnel economics has evolved on this foundation to a strong practical emphasis, with theoretical insights designed for practical use, and with strong focus on empirical research. The field is also characterized by creative data entrepreneurship. The types of datasets that personnel economists use are described. If similar datasets can be obtained for public sector workforces, personnel economics should be a very useful approach <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> <b>them...</b>|$|R

This paper presents a unified Markov chain approach <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> <b>them.</b> Using the approach, the sufficient and necessary conditions of convergence in distribution are established. Then the average convergence rate is introduced to randomised search heuristics and its lower and upper bounds are derived. Finally, novel average drift analysis and backward drift analysis are proposed for bounding the expected hitting time. A computational study is also conducted to investigate the convergence, convergence rate and expected hitting time. The theoretical <b>study</b> belongs <b>to</b> a prior and general study while the computational <b>study</b> belongs <b>to</b> a posterior and case study...|$|R
40|$|We {{suggest that}} {{interest}} in the new times of the knowledge economy may privilege attention to new organizational forms and new approaches <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> <b>them</b> {{at the expense of}} those from the past. Arguing that concerns with representation are not necessarily related either to postmodern epistemology or to postmodern epoch, we show how the modernist movement of cubism was an earlier complication of representation that has much to contribute to both the form and content of contemporary organizational studies. We identify some of the main tenets of a cubist approach to organizational analysis and argue that cubism offers an extension to current interest in aesthetics within organizational studies. Cubism, we argue, offers an aesthetic contribution that may supplement contemporary approaches <b>to</b> small-scale organizational <b>studies</b> by slowing <b>them</b> down: by allowing attention to repetition, to the mundane and to the taken for granted...|$|R
25|$|Once {{the novelty}} of the Seventh Symphony had worn away, {{audience}} interest in the West quickly dissipated. One reason {{may have been the}} work's length. At about 70 minutes, it was longer than any previous Shostakovich symphony. While {{it could be argued that}} he could have made the symphony 30 minutes shorter by condensing his message, the long passages of sparsely accompanied solos for wind instruments present listeners with the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>them,</b> appreciate the inner character of the music as each instrument soliloquises on a given mood. To utilize this to the extent that Shostakovich did, combined with a wordless narrative style of mood-painting, necessitated an expansive time frame. Even so, this extended time span may have seemed excessive to some critics, especially since Western critics were unaware of the anti-Stalinist subtext hidden in the work. Hearing it only in the context of wartime propaganda, Western critics dismissed the symphony as a series of bombastic platitudes, and as such not worth serious consideration. The critic Ernest Newman famously remarked that, to find its place on the musical map, one should look along the seventieth degree of longitude and the last degree of platitude.|$|E
25|$|Mitigating {{damage to}} the {{environment}} was a concern, as part of creating an authentic experience of the landscape, which was to unroll like a movie from the motorist's perspective. The median strip was therefore relatively narrow; trees were retained close to the highway and sometimes, for example in the oak forest near Dessau, in the median. In fact the driver's experience of the forest, assigned symbolic importance in German Romanticism and particularly under the Nazis, was maximized by avoiding straightaways in forested areas so that the driver remained enclosed by the trees as long as possible. To some extent the autobahn landscapers were influenced in this emphasis on the natural environment by the American parkways; Todt had a 1934 USDA bulletin on Roadside Improvement reprinted for his planners' use, and Nazi designers visited Westchester County <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>them,</b> {{about the same time}} that the Westchester County Parks Commission (WCPC) was partly overseeing the construction of what is today the Taconic State Parkway's southern stretches. But the Reichsautobahn aimed for a more natural, less parklike view from the road, and although in both countries using natively occurring plants in highway landscaping was important, the Americans selectively emphasized those with an attractive appearance. Also, the autobahn was at the time presented, by Todt and others, as an improvement to the natural landscape; Todt refused to avoid the Siebengebirge, a protected conservation area, arguing not only that the area should be opened up for visits but that the road would make it more beautiful. This was not the policy in the U.S., where, most famously, the Blue Ridge Parkway was designed to be narrow and unobtrusive. Cost had the opposite effect with respect to plantings than it did with respect to curves: the Reichsautobahn landscapers had performed pioneering analyses of local ecosystems that led them to plant intensively in order to reconstruct what they determined would have been naturally present at the site, but at the end of 1936, as a result of cost overruns as well as his personal philosophy, Todt severely curtailed plantings, calling for an emphasis on open views.|$|E
