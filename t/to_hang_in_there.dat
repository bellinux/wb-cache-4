2500|$|After {{losing his}} {{re-election}} bid for Mayor to George Voinovich in 1979, Kucinich initially kept {{a low profile}} in Cleveland politics. He criticized a tax referendum proposed by Voinovich in 1980, which voters eventually approved. He also struggled to find employment and moved to Los Angeles, California, where he stayed with a friend, actress Shirley MacLaine. During the next three years, Kucinich worked as a radio talk-show host, lecturer, and consultant. It was a difficult period for Kucinich financially. Without a steady paycheck, Kucinich fell behind in his mortgage payments, nearly lost his house in Cleveland, and ended up borrowing money from friends, including MacLaine, to keep it. On his 1982 income tax return, Kucinich reported an income of $38. When discussing this period, Kucinich stated, [...] "When I {{was growing up in}} Cleveland, my early experience conditioned me <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and not to quit... It's one thing to experience that as a child, but when you have to as an adult, it has a way to remind you how difficult things can be. You understand what people go through." ...|$|E

[...] Lisa Alspector of the Chicago Reader also gave the film a negative review, writing [...] "Geek-triumphs-after-all comedies can be charming, but in this one the triumphing begins so early it's hard to feel for the geek." [...] Michael O'Sullivan of the Washington Post described the movie as [...] "Another film about [...] [...] [...] a cretinous, grating loser." ...|$|E

I found a Teen People magazine with me on the cover of [...] "The New It Girls", and it was me, Jessica Biel, Scarlett Johansson and Kirsten Dunst. I was in that company at one point in my career - I had just done Daylight with Sylvester Stallone 1996. And then somewhere along the line, I don’t know what happened. It was not for a lack of trying - they got that one movie after that that really pushed them, and I feel like I'm always looking for that movie. I've just managed <b>to</b> barely <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> by the skin of my teeth, but I think that’s why I'm still working is because I've hung <b>in</b> <b>there.</b> With Rob Zombie bringing me back for Halloween, it's ironic that the same movie that started my career reinvented it again."

50|$|The {{bell tower}} in Russian Revival style {{is now the}} most notable {{building}} in the modern monastery complex; it {{also serves as a}} portal into the monastery. The bell tower was erected in 1903 - 1903 in line with the last abbess' Lyudmila intention to replace an existing old, shabby bell tower with a new one. The construction, to a design by Theodor Vorontsov, a city architect, was entirely funded from donations. The main bell was cast {{at the expense of the}} duchess Anna Orlova-Сhesmenskaya. There is a suggestion that about 18 bells are <b>to</b> be <b>hanged</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> 1922.|$|R
5000|$|Having {{converted}} to Catholicism during their tenure {{in the county}} jail, [...] the outlaws asked for their bodies to be delivered to the local Roman Catholic priest, Father Gallagher. Their hats were then taken from them and black hoods pulled down over their heads. The nooses were subsequently adjusted around their necks. It was then Daniel [...] "York" [...] Kelly, his voice muffled by the hood which covered his features, said, [...] "Let her go!" [...] On March 28, 1884, at 1:18 p.m. James [...] "Tex" [...] Howard, Dan [...] "Big Dan" [...] Dowd, William Delaney (or DeLaney), Omer W. [...] "Red" [...] Sample, and Kelly were executed. They were dropped together and, except for Dowd, died quickly. Dowd's body was seen to twitch and jerk for several minutes as he strangled to death. The bodies of the Bisbee bandits were allowed <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the early spring air for a full half-hour before they were officially pronounced dead. Then, at 1:45 p.m. the corpses were cut down and “placed in neat but plain coffins” and conveyed to the city morgue, where they were each identified in turn by Gallagher.|$|R
5000|$|Many of Seton's novels {{focus on}} [...] "affluent, middle-aged women" [...] who are {{dissatisfied}} with their lives as wives and mothers. Seton did not use feminist rhetoric, but instead adopted [...] "a graceful and ironic style laced with compassion for women struggling to find expression and for the men in their lives". She explained in an interview:I want to write about husbands who may be obtuse, but who are not brutes, and remind their wives {{that there is a}} great deal <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> for. And I want to take the middle-aged woman and evoke her refusal to be demeaned, to honor it with a serious acknowledgement.|$|E

5000|$|Brown {{enrolled}} at the University of Maryland, and served a redshirt season in 2009. In 2010, he saw action in four plays against Morgan State. On his first snap, he gained 12 yards on an option run, and lowered his shoulder into two opposing tacklers. He suffered a broken collarbone on the run, but remained in the game for three more plays. The injury ended his season. During his convalescence, head coach Ralph Friedgen said, [...] "I just told him he has <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> he has {{to sit in the}} meetings and learn as much as you can. That's an area where he was coming on. I still think he's got {{the potential to be a}} very, very good quarterback. He's very mobile and he has a strong arm and is a smart guy. He's just further behind because of his high school development." [...] During the season, fellow redshirt sophomore Danny O'Brien captured the starting position and finished with ACC Rookie of the Year honors. Friedgen was fired after the season and replaced by Connecticut head coach Randy Edsall, who selected Gary Crowton as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach.|$|E

5000|$|Doubts {{were raised}} about the stadium again in August 2014 after it emerged that Rovers had issued a writ against Sainsbury's, alleging that the {{supermarket}} chain was attempting to terminate its contract to buy the Memorial Stadium site. At a six-day High Court hearing in May 2015, Sainsbury's argued it had [...] "lawfully terminated" [...] the contract when planning conditions were not met before the [...] "cut-off date" [...] in the agreement. On 13 July 2015, Mrs Justice Proudman ruled in favour of Sainsbury's saying the way the deal was structured was an [...] "insuperable barrier to the club". Rovers chairman Nick Higgs {{described it as a}} [...] "huge disappointment" [...] and stated “We will be asking them UWE <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> with us as it’s not over yet. We have looked at a number of other options to still bring this new stadium to fruition, even without the help of Sainsbury’s, {{and we will continue to}} do that. We have an obligation to explore options and it would be remiss of us not to do so for the sake of the fans, and for this club.” The club were granted leave to appeal later the same month and confirmed Sainsbury's had made an out of court cash offer to end the litigation, which was rejected being described as 'derisory'. The appeal, held in January 2016, saw the club's lawyers claim Mrs Justice Proudman made a [...] "fundamental error" [...] in agreeing with the supermarket chain. The verdict from the two-day appeal came on 17 March 2016 and upheld the high court decision.|$|E
5000|$|The fall {{began with}} Ray's trip to Missoula, Mont., in '72 to fish with friend and {{literary}} helpmate Bill Kittredge. That summer Ray {{fell in love}} with Diane Cecily, an editor at the University of Montana, whom he met at Kittredge's birthday party. [...] "That's when the serious drinking began. It broke my heart and hurt the children. It changed everything.""By fall of '74", writes Carver, [...] "he was more dead than alive. I had {{to drop out of the}} Ph.D. program so I could get him cleaned up and drive him to his classes". Over the next several years, Maryann's husband physically abused her. Friends urged her to leave Raymond."But I couldn't. I really wanted <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> for the long haul. I thought I could outlast the drinking. I'd do anything it took. I loved Ray, first, last and always."Carver describes, without a trace of rancor, what finally put her over the edge. In the fall of '78, with a new teaching position at the University of Texas at El Paso, Ray started seeing Tess Gallagher, a writer from Port Angeles, who would become his muse and wife near the end of his life. [...] "It was like a contretemps. He tried to call me to talk about where we were. I missed the calls. He knew he was about to invite Tess to Thanksgiving." [...] So he wrote a letter instead."I thought, I've gone through all those years fighting to keep it all balanced. Here it was, coming at me again, the same thing. I had to get on with my own life. But I never fell out of love with him." ...|$|E

40|$|First of all, {{my thanks}} {{go to my}} parents and all the great {{teachers}} that I had throughout my life.

I am very grateful to the Department of Chemistry and the Graduate School of the University of New Orleans for offering me the great chance to study and work at this great place. I am full of appreciation to my supervisor, Dr Richard B. Cole. During the four-year research, I learned a lot from him. Two of my projects stalled at the very beginning. I struggled for a long time, but made little progress. He always helped me and encouraged me <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> <b>there.</b> Because of that, we finally found hope from despair.

40|$|Everyone thinks. Keeping five {{themes in}} mind {{will ensure that}} every learner thinks skillfully. How {{do you know that}} your {{students}} {{need to learn how to}} think? When I have posed this question to teachers of all grade levels in countries around the world, teachers have given surprisingly similar and consistent descriptions of their students ' thinking: They just blurt out answers. They should think before they respond. They depend on me for their answers. I wish they would think for themselves. They give up so easily on difficult tasks. I'd like them <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> <b>there.</b> They can't seem to work in groups. They must learn to cooperate and work together. They don't apply their knowledge. I want them to use what they know in other situations. They are afraid to take risks. I'd like them to be more creative, more adventuresome. Such comments reflect teachers ' awareness that to function in school, at work, and in life, students must persist when faced with adversity, solve cognitively complex problems, draw on vast reservoirs of knowledge, and work collaboratively. To strengthen these skills, instruction must become more reflective, complex, and relevant (Commission on the Whole Child, 2007).
