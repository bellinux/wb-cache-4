25|$|Design of the CVTR began around 1955. CVTR had a <b>thermal</b> <b>output</b> {{of about}} 65 MWth and a gross {{electrical}} output of 19 MW.

25|$|The plant {{design was}} {{essentially}} the same as Calder Hall comprising four 180 MW(th) graphite moderated, carbon dioxide cooled nuclear reactors fuelled by natural abundance uranium (0.71% 235U) enclosed in magnesium-alloy cans, the principal difference being in plant layout. Since Chapelcross was commissioned from the outset as a four-reactor site (the option for a further four reactors was not exercised) rather than separate two-reactor sites as at Calder ‘A’ and ‘B’ stations, the site layout was more compact. There is a single turbine hall housing all eight turbines which were originally rated at 23 MW(e) but progressively uprated to 30 MW(e) as the reactor <b>thermal</b> <b>output</b> was uprated to nominally 265 MW(th).|$|E
500|$|The early fusion-fission {{designs were}} not well {{developed}} and only schematic {{outlines of the}} concept were shown. These systems looked like a scaled down version of NIF, with beamlines about [...] long {{on either side of}} a target chamber and power generation area. The laser produced 1.4MJ of UV light 13 times a second. The fusion took place in a [...] target chamber that was surrounded by [...] of unenriched fission fuel, or alternately about [...] of Pu or highly enriched uranium from weapons. The fusion system was expected to produce Q on the order of 25 to 30, resulting in 350 to 500MW of fusion energy. The fission processes triggered by the fusion would add an additional energy gain of 4 to 10 times, resulting in a total <b>thermal</b> <b>output</b> between 2000 and 5000MWth. Using high efficiency thermal-to-electric conversion systems like Rankine cycle designs in combination with demonstrated supercritical steam generators would allow about half of the <b>thermal</b> <b>output</b> to be turned into electricity.|$|E

40|$|This Master’s Thesis {{revolves}} around energy harvesting technologies from asphalt pavements. Standalone Photovoltaic and Thermal energy production technologies, {{as well as}} a hybrid design, have been modelled in several environments, using MATLAB. These environments were a combination of data measured on 9 different location in the Netherlands in 2014, and traffic scenarios which were created. The results indicate that the thermal energy generation results is energetically the most productive, whereas the Vlissingen location is the best location for all technologies to perform due to the high solar irradiation and wind speeds. For the development of a hybrid design there is found that mixing in of thermal conducting materials and reducing asphalt thickness can enhance both photovoltaic and <b>thermal</b> <b>outputs...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Large {{operating}} margins - the {{operating margins}} are typically {{the measure of}} a value compared to what that value {{would have to be}} to fail the fuel. [...] IRIS effectively gets much lower operating margins by having a core with a much lower power density, while the core is mostly the same size as a current PWR, the <b>thermal</b> <b>output</b> is much smaller, making it much less likely to reach film boiling and fail in an accident.|$|E

2500|$|Kerosene {{is used as}} a fuel in {{portable}} stoves, {{especially in}} Primus stoves invented in 1892. Portable kerosene stoves earn a reputation of reliable and durable stove in everyday use, and perform especially well under adverse conditions. In outdoor activities and mountaineering, a decisive advantage of pressurized kerosene stoves over gas cartridge stoves is their particularly high <b>thermal</b> <b>output</b> and their ability to operate at very low temperature in winter or at high altitude. [...] Wick stoves like Perfection's or wickless like Boss continue to be used by the Amish and off grid living and in natural disasters where there is no power available.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{exemplary}} 10 MWth biomass CHP {{plant with}} a FICFB (Fast Internally Circulating Fluidised Bed) gasifier and Jenbacher type 6 gas engine was simulated {{to estimate the}} power and <b>thermal</b> <b>outputs.</b> The biomass-fuelled CHP plant was modified for carbon capture using either adsorption or amine process. It was found that a two-stage, two-bed PVSA (Pressure Vacuum Swing Adsorption) unit applied to syngas stream for pre-combustion capture spent less specific energy per captured CO 2 than a conventional amine process for post-combustion carbon capture. In particular, adsorptive carbon capture is very promising for this application since, in comparison to amine process, adsorption process is economical for small-to-medium scale gas separations, the capital cost is relatively low {{and it does not}} require the evaporating, corrosive amine solvents...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{building}} upon studies [1 ‐ 8] {{describes a}} subset of the High Pressure Water (HPW) descaling strategy developed at Tata Steel UK to optimise descaling set-ups for range of steel grades prone to adherent primary scale such as in high alloy steels (Si, Ni, Cr). Effective primary descaling, i. e. descaling post furnace discharge via washbox or alternative technologies is imperative to obtain good surface quality and conditioning of the surface state as well as the morphology, growth and behaviour of the secondary/tertiary scale. This paper primarily focuses on analytical descaling concepts for both mechanical and <b>thermal</b> <b>outputs</b> for flat jet nozzle and process factors.

The haptic display combined torque and <b>thermal</b> <b>outputs,</b> and we used it in intimate relation with an auditory display in order to extend its expressive range.
