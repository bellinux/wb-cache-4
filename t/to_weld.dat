5|$|A {{variation}} of the spray transfer mode, pulse-spray {{is based on the}} principles of spray transfer but uses a pulsing current to melt the filler wire and allow one small molten droplet to fall with each pulse. The pulses allow the average current to be lower, decreasing the overall heat input and thereby decreasing the size of the weld pool and heat-affected zone while making it possible <b>to</b> <b>weld</b> thin workpieces. The pulse provides a stable arc and no spatter, since no short-circuiting takes place. This also makes the process suitable for nearly all metals, and thicker electrode wire can be used as well. The smaller weld pool gives the variation greater versatility, making it possible <b>to</b> <b>weld</b> in all positions. In comparison with short arc GMAW, this method has a somewhat slower maximum speed (85mm/s or 200in/min) and the process also requires that the shielding gas be primarily argon with a low carbon dioxide concentration. Additionally, it requires a special power source capable of providing current pulses with a frequency between 30 and 400 pulses per second. However, the method has gained popularity, since it requires lower heat input and can be used <b>to</b> <b>weld</b> thin workpieces, as well as nonferrous materials.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} airway {{response}} and its mechanism <b>to</b> <b>welding</b> fumes in six welders with respiratory symptoms. METHODS: Methacholine and welding challenge tests {{were carried out}}. The concentration of welding fumes during the exposure test was measured. On two subjects who developed bronchoconstricition <b>to</b> <b>welding</b> challenge, additional tests were carried out including prick, patch, and inhalation challenges with metal salt solutions. RESULTS: Three subjects developed immediate bronchial reaction <b>to</b> exposure <b>to</b> <b>welding</b> fume; one <b>to</b> mild steel and stainless steel <b>welding,</b> another <b>to</b> mild steel and galvanised welding, and one only <b>to</b> galvanised <b>welding.</b> They all had a moderate to pronounced degree of non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The concentration of fumes during <b>welding</b> tests, particularly <b>to</b> galvanised <b>welding,</b> was high. An inhalation challenge test with zinc chloride salt solution in two subjects who reacted <b>to</b> galvanised <b>welding</b> was negative.

5|$|The {{composition}} of the electrode core is generally similar and sometimes identical {{to that of the}} base material. But even though a number of feasible options exist, a slight difference in alloy composition can strongly impact the properties of the resulting weld. This is especially true of alloy steels such as HSLA steels. Likewise, electrodes of compositions {{similar to those of the}} base materials are often used for welding nonferrous materials like aluminium and copper. However, sometimes it is desirable to use electrodes with core materials significantly different from the base material. For example, stainless steel electrodes are sometimes used <b>to</b> <b>weld</b> two pieces of carbon steel, and are often utilized <b>to</b> <b>weld</b> stainless steel workpieces with carbon steel workpieces.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{versatility}} of {{the process}} and the simplicity of its equipment and operation, shielded metal arc welding is one of the world's first and most popular welding processes. It dominates other welding processes in the maintenance and repair industry, and though flux-cored arc welding is growing in popularity, SMAW continues to be used extensively in the construction of heavy steel structures and in industrial fabrication. The process is used primarily <b>to</b> <b>weld</b> iron and steels (including stainless steel) but aluminium, nickel and copper alloys can also be welded with this method.|$|E
5|$|GTAW is most {{commonly}} used <b>to</b> <b>weld</b> thin sections of stainless steel and non-ferrous metals such as aluminum, magnesium, and copper alloys. The process grants the operator greater control over the weld than competing processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding, allowing for stronger, higher quality welds. However, GTAW is comparatively more complex and difficult to master, and furthermore, it is significantly slower than most other welding techniques. A related process, plasma arc welding, uses a slightly different welding torch {{to create a more}} focused welding arc and as a result is often automated.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the modelling and simulation of welding process {{based on the}} finite element method (FEM) in order <b>to</b> predict the <b>welding</b> distortion of tractor wheel blades. Two FEM modellings are needed <b>to</b> obtain the <b>welding</b> distortion models, namely thermal and elasto-plastic. The effect of welding thermal is assumed as tendon force and {{to be used as}} input of the analysis of elasto-plastic modelling. Welding distortion simulation results were verified using the experimental data. The verification results have shown similar shape of the welding deformation between simulations and experimental. Also, deviation value of displacement distortion between simulation and experimental is small. Hence, the simulation of welding deformation modelling using thermal elasto-plastic FEM can be used <b>to</b> predict the <b>welding</b> distortion of tractor wheel blades. Based on simulation results, the shape of radial and axial displacement distortion due <b>to</b> <b>welding</b> the blade with serial sequence was larger than that of the shape distortion due <b>to</b> <b>welding</b> of the blade with a recommended sequence. After welding simulation of those of 16 wheels tractor blades, the predicted value of displacement distortion due <b>to</b> <b>welding</b> of the blade with serial sequence is equal to 3, 393 mm, which was larger than that of 1, 440 mm due <b>to</b> <b>welding</b> of the blade with recommended sequence...|$|R
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} is {{most commonly used}} <b>to</b> <b>weld</b> stainless steel and nonferrous materials, such as aluminum and magnesium, {{but it can be}} applied to nearly all metals, with a notable exception being zinc and its alloys. Its applications involving carbon steels are limited not because of process restrictions, but because of the existence of more economical steel welding techniques, such as gas metal arc welding and shielded metal arc welding. Furthermore, GTAW can be performed in a variety of other-than-flat positions, depending on the skill of the welder and the materials being welded.|$|E
5|$|Shallow penetration, another {{detriment}} <b>to</b> <b>weld</b> strength, can {{be addressed}} by decreasing welding speed, increasing the current or using a smaller electrode. Any of these weld-strength-related defects can make the weld prone to cracking, but other factors are involved as well. High carbon, alloy or sulfur content in the base material can lead to cracking, especially if low-hydrogen electrodes and preheating are not employed. Furthermore, the workpieces should not be excessively restrained, as this introduces residual stresses into the weld and can cause cracking as the weld cools and contracts.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} types of glass, and it is most common <b>to</b> <b>weld</b> using the same types. Different glasses often have {{different}} rates of thermal expansion, which can cause them to crack upon cooling when they contract differently. For instance, quartz has very low thermal expansion, while soda-lime glass has very high thermal expansion. When welding different glasses to each other, it is usually important to closely match their coefficients of thermal expansion, to ensure that cracking does not occur. Also, some glasses will simply not mix with others, so welding between certain types may not be possible.|$|E

40|$|Background & Aims of the Study: Welder’s {{exposure}} <b>to</b> <b>welding</b> fumes {{can cause}} occupational diseases. The current {{study sought to}} examine exposure <b>to</b> <b>welding</b> fumes among welders {{who work in the}} repair shop of Sarcheshmeh Copper Complex and design a local exhaust ventilation system to control exposure <b>to</b> <b>welding</b> fumes. 			Materials & Methods: This applied analytical study was conducted in the summer of 2016 among welders working in the repair shop of Sarcheshmeh Copper Complex. The study comprised three phases; in the first one, welders’ exposure <b>to</b> <b>welding</b> fumes was assessed {{at the beginning of the}} study. After that, a local exhaust ventilation system was designed and installed in the aforementioned repair shop. In the final stage, welders’ exposure <b>to</b> <b>welding</b> fumes was assessed again after installation of the ventilation system. The procedure recommended by NIOSH (method number 7300) was used for individual sampling of welders. 			Results: Based on the obtained findings, before installing the ventilation system, welding technicians were exposed to 0. 3 mg/m 3 of copper fumes and 0. 04 mg/m 3 of chromium fumes. Journeyman welders were also exposed to 2. 16 mg/m 3 of manganese fumes, while stellar welders were exposed to 6. 9 mg/m 3 of iron fumes. In the light of these measurements, a local exhaust ventilation system was designed and installed. Subsequently, measurement of exposure <b>to</b> <b>welding</b> fumes showed a significant reduction. That is, welding technicians were exposed to 0. 17 mg/m 3 and 0. 015 mg/m 3 of copper and chromium fumes respectively. Additionally, journeyman welders were exposed to 0. 86 mg/m 3 of manganese fumes, whereas stellar welders were exposed to 4. 3 mg/m 3 of iron fumes. 		 	 Conclusions: A comparison of standard limits of exposure <b>to</b> <b>welding</b> fumes and the results obtained from measurements in sampling stations before and after the installation of the local exhaust ventilation system reveals that this controlling measure was very effective in the repair shop of Sarcheshmeh Copper Complex...|$|R

5|$|GMAW with {{globular}} {{metal transfer}} {{is considered the}} least desirable {{of the three major}} GMAW variations, because of its tendency to produce high heat, a poor weld surface, and spatter. The method was originally developed as a cost efficient way <b>to</b> <b>weld</b> steel using GMAW, because this variation uses carbon dioxide, a less expensive shielding gas than argon. Adding to its economic advantage was its high deposition rate, allowing welding speeds of up to 110mm/s (250in/min). As the weld is made, a ball of molten metal from the electrode tends to build up {{on the end of the}} electrode, often in irregular shapes with a larger diameter than the electrode itself. When the droplet finally detaches either by gravity or short circuiting, it falls to the workpiece, leaving an uneven surface and often causing spatter. As a result of the large molten droplet, the process is generally limited to flat and horizontal welding positions, requires thicker workpieces, and results in a larger weld pool.|$|E
5|$|The hull is {{constructed}} from a high-tensile micro-alloy steel, developed by Swedish steel manufacturer SSAB, and improved by BHP of Australia, which was lighter and easier <b>to</b> <b>weld</b> than the HY-80 or HY-100 nickel-alloy steel used in contemporary submarine construction projects, while providing better results in explosion bulge testing. The submarines {{are covered in}} a skin of anechoic tiles to minimise detection by sonar: Collins was retrofitted with the tiles after the standard sonar signature of the submarine had been established, while the other five boats were covered during construction. These tiles were developed by the Australian DSTO: as the United States and United Kingdom would not share their information on the tiles used on their nuclear submarines, Australian researchers had to develop the tiles from scratch. The tiles were moulded {{in the shape of}} the hull, and are secured by a commercial adhesive normally used to fix cat's eyes to road surfaces: although British and American submarines are often seen with missing tiles, as of March 2007, none have been lost from a Collins-class boat.|$|E
5|$|While the {{aerospace}} industry {{is one of the}} primary users of gas tungsten arc welding, the process is used {{in a number of other}} areas. Many industries use GTAW for welding thin workpieces, especially nonferrous metals. It is used extensively in the manufacture of space vehicles, and is also frequently employed <b>to</b> <b>weld</b> small-diameter, thin-wall tubing such as those used in the bicycle industry. In addition, GTAW is often used to make root or first-pass welds for piping of various sizes. In maintenance and repair work, the process is commonly used to repair tools and dies, especially components made of aluminum and magnesium. Because the weld metal is not transferred directly across the electric arc like most open arc welding processes, a vast assortment of welding filler metal is available to the welding engineer. In fact, no other welding process permits the welding of so many alloys in so many product configurations. Filler metal alloys, such as elemental aluminum and chromium, can be lost through the electric arc from volatilization. This loss does not occur with the GTAW process. Because the resulting welds have the same chemical integrity as the original base metal or match the base metals more closely, GTAW welds are highly resistant to corrosion and cracking over long time periods, making GTAW the welding procedure of choice for critical operations like sealing spent nuclear fuel canisters before burial.|$|E
