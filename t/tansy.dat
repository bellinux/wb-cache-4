5|$|A 2009 {{study of}} <b>tansy</b> beetle {{occupancy}} amongst 1305 patches (stems separated by {{no more than}} 50cm) of the <b>tansy</b> plant {{on the banks of the}} River Ouse (York, UK) intended to establish data on the distribution of <b>tansy</b> plants and relate this to existing <b>tansy</b> beetle populations in order to contribute to the conservation effort of the species. The results were analysed using generalised additive models to conclude that the <b>tansy</b> patches should be managed towards volumes of 3m and that these patches should be targeted within 200m of existing beetle subpopulations on the same river bank in order to help the beetle population disperse and survive.|$|E
5|$|The <b>tansy</b> plant {{naturally}} {{contains a}} number of volatile components including 1,8-cineole, trans-thujone, camphor and myrtenol, with the quantities and proportions of each varying seasonally and from plant to plant. 1,8-cineole is a toxin believed to defend the plant leaves against attacks by herbivores. The <b>tansy</b> beetle is resistant to these chemicals. However, <b>tansy</b> is a repellent to other Chrysomelid beetles. For example, the steam distillate of fresh leaves and flowers of <b>tansy</b> contains high levels of camphor and umbellulone and is strongly repellent to the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata).|$|E
5|$|Within the York {{distribution}} {{the beetles}} {{are dependent on}} <b>tansy</b> as their sole food source; if a clump disappears the beetles are forced to walk to a new location as they rarely fly, despite having fully working wings and being capable of doing so. The loss of habitat impacts upon {{the ability of the}} <b>tansy</b> beetle to find an alternative source of the host plant. Additionally, <b>tansy</b> is a ruderal species and thus has a naturally high rate of turnover of plants, forcing beetles to regularly seek out new <b>tansy</b> patches to colonise.|$|E

5|$|The <b>tansy</b> beetle (Chrysolina graminis) is {{a species}} of leaf beetle. It {{measures}} 7.7–10.5mm in length and has a characteristic bright metallic green colouration. The common name derives from the <b>tansy</b> plant on which they often feed as both larvae and adults. In addition to the nominotypical subspecies, which repeats the specific name, C. graminis graminis, there are five further distinct subspecies of <b>tansy</b> beetle, which, collectively, have a Palearctic distribution, although {{in the majority of}} countries where it is found the species is declining. In the United Kingdom it is designated as 'Nationally Rare' and this localised population, centred on York, North Yorkshire, {{has been the subject of}} much recent research.|$|E
5|$|All <b>tansy</b> beetles are small, rounded beetles {{approximately}} 7–12mm in length. There {{are both}} internal and external morphological differences between the six subspecies.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} {{formally}} designated as 'Nationally Rare' in the United Kingdom and categorised as a 'Species of Principal Importance' {{in accordance with}} the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006. The <b>Tansy</b> Beetle Action Group was set up in 2008 to initiate and oversee conservation efforts and comprises representatives from the University of York, North Yorkshire County Council, City of York Council, Environment Agency and the National Trust. A recovery programme started, involving annual surveys of both <b>tansy</b> and beetles, control of tree shading and invasive plants that compete with <b>tansy,</b> such as Himalayan balsam, and limited re-introductions within the current species range. New clumps of <b>tansy</b> have been planted, particularly between isolated existing patches which may be beyond the 200m walking range of the beetle. In order to publicise the conservation project Rachael Maskell, the Member of Parliament for the constituency of York Central became a 'Tansy Beetle Species Champion' in 2016. That same year, a team of 30 volunteers surveyed a 90km stretch of the banks of the River Ouse. The surveying has identified an upward trend in population numbers, rising over 60% between 2015 and 2016 to 40,000 individuals.|$|E

5|$|The <b>tansy</b> beetle has a Palearctic distribution. Evidence from archaeological {{excavation}} {{has shown}} that its presence in western Europe is confirmed at least {{as early as the}} Neolithic period. The beetles may be found on <b>tansy</b> (Tanacetum vulgare) and water mint (Mentha aquatica) in fen land and the banks of rivers with broad floodplains in Britain. Larvae are also recorded from other host plants: Achillea ptarmica (sneezewort) in France and various plants of the genus Artemisia in Russia. Adults and larvae feed on the leaves of their host plants.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{its range}} is {{currently}} restricted to about 45km {{of the banks}} of the River Ouse centred on York, North Yorkshire. Although there are scattered records from across England some of these may represent mis-identifications of the mint beetle, a more widespread species. <b>Tansy</b> beetles had previously been recorded from Wicken Fen, Cambridgeshire, where species of mint (Mentha spp.), not <b>tansy,</b> acted as the host plant. The last accurate record for the beetle at this site was in 1981. In August 2014 a new sighting was made nearby at Woodwalton Fen, following which a relocation programme involving hundreds of adult beetles from Yorkshire to this site was undertaken. As of 2006 there were 19 British hectads (10km squares) with records of the <b>tansy</b> beetle, but it has only been seen in 11 of these since 1970, six of which are centred around York. In 2015, the total number of individuals estimated from a survey of this area on {{the banks of the}} River Ouse was 24,000. In 2016 this number increased significantly to 40,000.|$|E
5|$|Larvae {{of other}} Chrysomelids are predated by birds, coccinellids, predatory bugs, {{lacewing}} larvae, syrphid larvae, carabids, ants, wasps, spiders and harvestmen, {{all of which}} are common on the <b>tansy</b> around the York population. The pupal stage may be directly predated by the European mole.|$|E

5|$|Both {{adults and}} larvae {{use the same}} host plant during their life cycle. As <b>tansy</b> often grows in {{discrete}} clumps, {{the total population of}} C. graminis in an area may be divided and individuals may spend their entire life cycle within an area of a few square metres.|$|E
5|$|The <b>tansy</b> beetle {{was first}} {{described}} by Linnaeus in 1758 in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae as Chrysomela graminis {{and was later}} transferred to the genus Chrysolina. The genus Chrysolina currently contains 39 subgenera. C. graminis (with its several subspecies) {{is located in the}} subgenus Euchrysolina which contains only one other species – C. virgata; this subgenus was first established in 1950.|$|E
5|$|A few adult beetles may {{overlap between}} {{the spring and}} summer populations, but most adults from the earlier {{emergence}} die before the end of summer. Both adult and larval <b>tansy</b> beetles are unble to detect their host plant, or each other, at a distance, either by smell, sight or a combination of the two. Starvation is thus likely to be a major contributor to mortality when beetles wander away from their host and become lost.|$|E

5|$|Bacterial {{insecticides}} can {{be effective}} if application is targeted towards the vulnerable early-instar larvae. Two strains of the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis produce toxins which kill the larvae. Other forms of pest control, through non-pesticidal management are available. Feeding can be inhibited by applying antifeedants, such as fungicides or products derived from Neem (Azadirachta indica), but these may have negative effects on the plants as well. The steam distillate of fresh leaves and flowers of <b>tansy</b> (Tanacetum vulgare) contains high levels of camphor and umbellulone and these chemicals are strongly repellent to L. decemlineata.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} {{is covered}} predominantly by temperate coniferous forest, which makes up approximately 64 {{percent of the}} total area. The primary species in these areas are Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, madrone, and incense-cedar. Buckbrush and manzanita grow in the drier chaparral regions. Several rare plants including Gentner's fritillary, oblongleaf stonecrop, Siskiyou lewisia, clustered lady's slipper, and splithair Indian paintbrush also grow in the watershed. Seven species of noxious weeds have been identified: three species of thistles, medusahead rye, Scotch broom, St. Johns wort, and <b>tansy</b> ragwort.|$|E
5|$|There are six {{subspecies}} of <b>tansy</b> beetle. The nominate subspecies C. graminis graminis {{was established}} via the original {{description of the}} species in 1758. C. graminis santonici (named after the Italian name, Santonico, for its host plant Artemisa caerulescens) was described by N. B. Contarini in 1847. In 1860 Motschulsky described two subspecies – C. graminis artemisiae and C. graminis auraria. These were added to in the 20th century with C. graminis christianae (Mallet, 1933) and C. graminis mediterranea Bechyné, 1950.|$|E
5000|$|Golowan [...] (sometimes also Goluan or Gol-Jowan) is the Cornish {{language}} {{word for}} the Midsummer celebrations in Cornwall, UK: widespread prior to the late 19th century and most popular in the Penwith area and in particular Penzance and Newlyn. The celebrations were conducted from 23 June (St John's Eve) to 28 June (St Peter's Eve) each year, St Peter's Eve being the more popular in Cornish fishing communities. The celebrations were centred on the lighting of bonfires and fireworks {{and the performance of}} associated rituals. The midsummer bonfire ceremonies (<b>Tansys</b> Golowan in Cornish) were revived at St Ives in 1929 by the Old Cornwall Society and since then spread to other societies across Cornwall, as far as Kit Hill near Callington. Since 1991 the Golowan festival in Penzance has revived many of these ancient customs and has grown to become a major arts and culture festival: its central event 'Mazey Day' now attracts {{tens of thousands of people}} to the Penzance area in late June.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tansies</b> {{are mainly}} {{perennial}} herbs, {{but some are}} annuals and subshrubs. Some are a few centimeters tall and some reach 1.5 m. They vary in form, {{with one or more}} branching stems growing erect or prostrate, usually from rhizomes. They are hairy to hairless in texture, and most are aromatic. The leaves are alternately arranged, the blades sometimes borne on petioles. They are usually deeply lobed and may have toothed edges. Most species have flowers in loose or dense inflorescences. The flower has layers of distinct phyllaries around its base and may be flat to hemispheric in shape. The flower has many yellow disc florets, sometimes over 300. Some species have ray florets in shades of yellow, or white with yellowish bases. Some species lack true ray florets but have flat yellowish disc florets that look like rays. The fruit is a ribbed, glandular cypsela, usually with a pappus on the end.|$|R
60|$|Having {{passed the}} New Hampshire line {{and reached the}} Horseshoe Interval in Tyngsborough, {{where there is a}} high and regular second bank, we climbed up this in haste to get a nearer sight of the autumnal flowers, asters, golden-rod, and yarrow, and blue-curls (Trichostema dichotoma), humble {{roadside}} blossoms, and, lingering still, the harebell and the Rhexia Virginica. The last, growing in patches of lively pink flowers {{on the edge of the}} meadows, had almost too gay an appearance for the rest of the landscape, like a pink ribbon on the bonnet of a Puritan woman. Asters and golden-rods were the livery which nature wore at present. The latter alone expressed all the ripeness of the season, and shed their mellow lustre over the fields, as if the now declining summer's sun had bequeathed its hues to them. It is the floral solstice a little after midsummer, when the particles of golden light, the sun-dust, have, as it were, fallen like seeds on the earth, and produced these blossoms. On every hillside, and in every valley, stood countless asters, coreopses, <b>tansies,</b> golden-rods, and the whole race of yellow flowers, like Brahminical devotees, turning steadily with their luminary from morning till night.|$|R

5|$|Artificial {{freshwater}} ponds (often called stews) held carp, pike, tench, bream, eel, and other fish. Poultry {{was kept in}} special yards, with pigeon and squab being reserved for the elite. Game was highly prized, but very rare, and included venison, wild boar, hare, rabbit, and birds. Kitchen gardens provided herbs, including some, such as <b>tansy,</b> rue, pennyroyal, and hyssop, which are rarely used today. Spices were treasured and very expensive at that time – they included pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and mace. Some spices used then, but no longer today in French cuisine are cubebs, long pepper (both from vines similar to black pepper), grains of paradise, and galengale. Sweet-sour flavors were commonly added to dishes with vinegars and verjus combined with sugar (for the affluent) or honey. A common form of food preparation was to finely cook, pound and strain mixtures into fine pastes and mushes, something believed to be beneficial {{to make use of}} nutrients.|$|E
5|$|Beetle remains bearing what {{appeared}} to be the marks of bird attacks have been found by the River Ouse and hardened adults often bear symmetrically indented elytra, interpreted as 'pinch marks' inflicted by a beak whilst newly emerged adults are still hardening. Dead beetles have also been found in the webs of spiders in a captive population. The accidental predation of C. graminis by livestock consuming the <b>tansy</b> plant is also possible. Predation of a larva by the scorpionfly Panorpa germanica has been observed in the field. The tachinid genus Macquartia exclusively parasitizes Chrysolmelid beetles and one species of which, Macquartia dispar, may parasitise C. graminis directly. The adult fly deposits fully incubated eggs or newly hatched larvae into the vicinity of the host larvae.|$|E
5|$|Beetles' flight {{wings are}} crossed with veins and are folded after landing, often along these veins, and stored below the elytra. A fold (jugum) of the {{membrane}} {{at the base}} of each wing is characteristic. Some beetles have lost the ability to fly. These include some ground beetles (Carabidae) and some true weevils (Curculionidae), as well as desert- and cave-dwelling species of other families. Many have the two elytra fused together, forming a solid shield over the abdomen. In a few families, both the ability to fly and the elytra have been lost, as in the glow-worms (Phengodidae), where the females resemble larvae throughout their lives. The presence of elytra and wings does not always indicate that the beetle will fly. For example, the <b>tansy</b> beetle walks between habitats despite being physically capable of flight.|$|E
5|$|Before mating, {{males and}} females may stridulate, or vibrate the objects they are on. In the Meloidae, the male climbs onto the dorsum of the female and strokes his {{antennae}} on her head, palps, and antennae. In Eupompha, the male draws his antennae along his longitudinal vertex. They may not mate at all {{if they do not}} perform the precopulatory ritual. This mating behaviour may be different amongst dispersed populations of the same species. For example, the mating of a Russian population of <b>tansy</b> beetle (Chysolina graminis) is preceded by an elaborate ritual involving the male tapping the female's eyes, pronotum and antennae with its antennae, which is not evident in the population of this species in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Mesa Verdeans {{supplemented}} {{their diet}} by gathering {{the seeds and}} fruits of wild plants, searching large expanses of land while procuring these resources. Depending on the season, they collected piñon nuts and juniper berries, weedy goosefoot, pigweed, purslane, tomatillo, <b>tansy</b> mustard, globe mallow, sunflower seeds, and yucca, as well as various species of grass and cacti. Prickly pear fruits provided a rare source of natural sugar. Wild seeds were cooked and ground up into porridge. They used sagebrush and mountain mahogany, along with piñon and juniper, for firewood. They also smoked wild tobacco. Because the Ancestral Puebloans considered all material consumed and discarded by their communities as sacred, their midden piles were viewed with reverence. Starting during the Basketmaker III period, , Mesa Verdeans often buried their dead in these mounds.|$|E
