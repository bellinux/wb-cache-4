"It {{starts off}} {{with a bit of}} {{keyboards}} that lead to a series of rapid but somewhat quiet beats over which she sings softly, almost whispering, until she reaches the chorus and fulminating beats drop. [...] "What is life?" [...] she asks during the bilingual chorus, which simply ends with the word [...] "contrail." [...] After the chorus the beats quiet down again and she once again whisper-sings. It's really quite intoxicating, the way her airy vocals gently glide over the hypnotic but subtle beats. [...] "I didn't know <b>then,</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> know now," [...] a loud, robotic voice sings -- well, it's more like it just says the words about two thirds into the song. And that somehow makes it more intense when Namie sings the chorus again and asks [...] "What is life?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Dan Rather stated, [...] "if I knew <b>then</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{know now}} — I {{would not have}} gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and I {{certainly}} would not have used the documents in question." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jones {{called on}} President George W. Bush to {{apologize}} for misinforming Congress to win authorization for the war. Jones said, [...] "If I had known <b>then</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> know today, I wouldn't have voted for that resolution." ...|$|E

2500|$|On September 20, CBS {{retracted}} the story. Rather stated, [...] "If I knew <b>then</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> know now, I {{would not}} have gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and I certainly {{would not have}} used the documents in question."

2500|$|Next, Henslow {{called upon}} Admiral Robert FitzRoy, {{who had been}} Darwin's captain and {{companion}} on the voyage of the Beagle twenty-five years earlier. FitzRoy denounced Darwin's book and, [...] "lifting an immense Bible first {{with both hands and}} afterwards with one hand over his head, solemnly implored the audience to believe God rather than man". He was believed to have said: [...] "I believe that this is the Truth, and had I known <b>then</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> know now, I would not have taken him [...] aboard the Beagle." ...|$|E
2500|$|Goldstone {{wrote that}} [...] "If I had known <b>then</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> know now, the Goldstone Report {{would have been}} a {{different}} document." [...] He said that the lack of Israeli cooperation had meant that no Israeli officers were interviewed during the writing of the report. In hindsight, incidents that had been interpreted as the deliberate targeting of civilians may have had other explanations, such as poor intelligence information. Goldstone also praised Israel for investigating claims of war crimes while faulting Hamas for its failure to launch any investigations of its own forces. Goldstone commended Israel for responding to his report by revising military procedures e.g. to discontinue the use of white phosphorus (including as a smokescreen) in or near civilian areas.|$|E

2500|$|Wallenda briefly {{considered}} {{becoming a}} doctor, and was accepted into college. [...] However, his plans changed in 1998. [...] At age 19, {{he participated in}} a re-creation of Karl Wallenda's seven-person pyramid on the high-wire in Detroit, Michigan, alongside his father, mother, and other family members. [...] Afterwards, he {{decided to make a}} career of it. [...] "I knew <b>then</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was born to do," [...] he later said. [...] "We were on every TV show around the world and I said, 'if there is this much attention on what I do, then I need to carry on this legacy'".

2500|$|While many of {{her books}} were best sellers, critics were most appreciative of her murder mysteries. Rinehart, in The Circular Staircase (1908), is {{credited}} with inventing the [...] "Had-I-But-Known" [...] school of mystery writing. In The Circular Staircase [...] "a middle-aged spinster is persuaded by her niece and nephew to rent a country house for the summer. The gentle, peace-loving trio is plunged {{into a series of}} crimes solved {{with the help of the}} aunt." [...] The Had-I-But-Known mystery novel is one where the principal character (frequently female) does things in connection with a crime that have the effect of prolonging the action of the novel. Ogden Nash parodied the school in his poem Don't Guess Let Me Tell You: [...] "Sometimes the Had I But Known <b>then</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> know now I could have saved at least three lives by revealing to the Inspector the conversation I heard through that fortuitous hole in the floor." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{authenticity}} of the documents was challenged within hours on Internet forums and blogs, with questions initially focused on alleged anachronisms in the documents' typography. [...] Content soon spread to the mass media. Although CBS and Rather defended the authenticity and usage of the documents for a two-week period, continued scrutiny from other news organizations and independent analysis of the documents obtained by USA Today and CBS raised questions about their validity {{and led to a}} public repudiation on September 20, 2004. Rather stated, [...] "if I knew <b>then</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> know now – I would not have gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and I certainly would not have used the documents in question," [...] and CBS News President Andrew Heyward said, [...] "Based on what we now know, CBS News cannot prove that the documents are authentic, which is the only acceptable journalistic standard to justify using them in the report. We should not have used them. That was a mistake, which we deeply regret." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1980, having {{signed with}} Columbia, the group reunited with their old Motown {{collaborators}} Ashford & Simpson, recording and releasing the album, About Love, {{which included the}} charted singles [...] "Taste of Bitter Love", [...] "Bourgie, Bourgie" [...] and [...] "Landlord". They continued the collaboration with the duo on their 1981 follow-up, Touch, which included the single [...] "I Will Fight", and a cover of [...] "I Will Survive".
