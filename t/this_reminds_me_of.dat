2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1904, KR became {{somewhat}} {{attached to}} an attractive young {{man by the name}} of Yatsko. [...] "I sent for Yatsko and he came this morning. I easily persuaded him to be candid. It was strange for me to hear him describe the familiar characteristics: he has never felt drawn to a woman, and has been infatuated with men several times. I did not confess to him that I knew these feelings from my own personal experience. Yatsko and I talked for a long time. Before leaving he kissed my face and hands; I should not have allowed this, and should have pushed him away, however I was punished afterwards by vague feelings of shame and remorse. He told me that, ever since the first time we met, his soul has been filled with rapturous feelings towards me, which grow all the time. How <b>this</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> my own youth." [...] A few days later, KR and Yatsko met again, and a relationship developed between the two.|$|E
6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a circumstance. Just {{after we}} left Julesburg, on the Platte, I was sitting with the driver, and he said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is encouraging," [...] said he. [...] "It is my {{dread of}} the water that has {{prevented}} me from returning to Sangoa, or even visiting my yacht. And <b>this</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a favor I wish to ask." ...|$|E
6000|$|We found Hans, {{who had not}} {{accompanied}} us, being {{a little}} shy of appearing in public just then, engaged in cleaning the rifles, and <b>this</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> something. Taking the double-barrelled gun of which I have spoken, I called Mavovo {{and handed it to}} him, saying: ...|$|R

60|$|Look at {{the rapid}} {{manner in which}} the news of the Galveston {{disaster}} was made known to the entire world. <b>This</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> an episode which occurred fifteen years ago when I was at church in Hartford, Connecticut.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here, Jack, is a lady inquiring {{after your}} health. Betts, <b>this</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the time Isaac came home wounded, after his {{escape from the}} Hurons. Strikes me he and his Indian bride should be about due here on a visit." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a remark, I have {{elsewhere}} made {{respecting the}} expediency of separating the arguments addressed to, and valid for, a believer, from the proofs and vindications of Scripture intended {{to form the}} belief, or to convict the Infidel.|$|E
5000|$|I {{recall a}} faculty party at Cornell, {{the day after}} the annual Fourth of July celebration at the {{university}} football stadium with fireworks. The wife of an economics professor, when asked if she had enjoyed the fireworks, replied, [...] "Yes, but I could have done without all the flag-waving." [...] <b>This</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> that familiar old song—familiar in some circles, at least—"If you don't like my peaches, why do you shake my tree?" ...|$|R
60|$|I suggested, {{a little}} warmly, {{that if she}} allowed her father to leave her alone at night with {{delicate}} children, she {{had no right to}} choose WHO should assist her in an emergency. It struck me afterwards that this was not very complimentary to him, and I added hastily that I wondered if she expected some young lady to be passing along the trail at midnight! But <b>this</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Johnson's style of argument, and I stopped.|$|R
6000|$|Father Brown laughed. [...] "I am only on my holiday," [...] he said. [...] "I haven't got any theories. Only <b>this</b> place <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> fairy stories, and, if you like, I'll {{tell you}} a story." ...|$|R
60|$|THE STATUE. Good. [Reflectively] All the same, the Superman {{is a fine}} conception. There is {{something}} statuesque about it. [He places himself on the grave trap beside The Devil. It begins to descend slowly. Red glow from the abyss]. Ah, <b>this</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> old times.|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Shakespeare’s “Aroint thee, witch!” I find {{in several}} books of that age the words aloigne and eloigne—that is,—“keep your distance!” or “off with you!” Perhaps “aroint” was a {{corruption}} of “aloigne” by the vulgar. The common etymology from ronger to gnaw seems unsatisfactory.|$|E

5000|$|The timbre of {{your voice}} on <b>this</b> tune <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> George Harrison’s sound, the tune {{as a whole}} is very Beatle inspired. Did you write it with that {{intention}} or did it just develop that way? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No trouble, I assure you, and <b>this</b> book <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> what I {{was about}} to say. Have you an hour to spare for my little niece? Her mother wants her to begin, and desired me to make the inquiry." ...|$|R
60|$|Thereon all {{the lower}} part of the hall went away and the little tables at which we ate were removed by servants, leaving us only wine-cups in our hands which a butler filled from time to time, mixing the wine with water. <b>This</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> something, and having asked leave, I beckoned to Bes, who still lingered near the door, and took from him that splendid, golden goblet which the Great King had given me, that by my command he had brought wrapped up in linen and hidden beneath his robe. Having undone the wrappings I bowed and offered it to the Prince Peroa.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha!" [...] cried Gaston, [...] "what means this? {{is there}} a tilt towards? <b>This</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the good old days, ere the Prince fell ill. The lists, the galleries, the ladies, the Prince's own chair of state, too! Oh, Sir Eustace, I could tear my hair that you cannot yet use your sword arm!" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> {{the remark}} made to myself once by a lady in {{reference}} to this same Coral Island. [...] "There is one thing, Mr Ballantyne," [...] she said, [...] "which I really {{find it hard to}} believe. You make one of your three boys dive into a clear pool, go to the bottom, and then, turning on his back, look up and wink and laugh at the other two." ...|$|E
6000|$|A great {{portion of}} this vast machinery--these {{hundreds}} of men and coaches, and thousands of mules and horses--was {{in the hands of}} Mr. Ben Holliday. All the western half of the business was in his hands. <b>This</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> an incident of Palestine travel which is pertinent here, so I will transfer it just in the language in which I find it set down in my Holy Land note-book: ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I’ve {{been working}} with the new {{keyboards}} and ultimately developing one sound. So, in a way, <b>this</b> record <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the experience that I had on From the Choirgirl Hotel, where technology and keyboards and the Bösendorfer were working together in an advanced way.|$|R
6000|$|My casual friend, Shakings, the holder, {{happened}} to be by at the time. Touching my arm, he said, [...] "White-Jacket, <b>this</b> here <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Sing-Sing, when a draft of fellows in darbies, came on from the State Prison at Auburn {{for a change of}} scene like, you know!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Melancholy hole <b>this,</b> Major. <b>Remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Westminster Abbey in London fog, {{where your}} uncle of blessed mem'ry often take me pray {{and look at}} fusty tomb of king. S'pose we go back Gold House and see what happen. Anything better than stand about under cursed old cedar tree." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a {{conversation}} I once over heard. [...] "How a statement so injurious to Mr. A. and so {{contrary to the}} truth, should {{have been made to}} you by Mr. B. I do not pretend to account for;--only I know of my own knowledge that B. is an inveterate liar, and has long borne malice against Mr. A.; and I can prove that he has repeatedly declared that in some way or other he would do Mr. A. a mischief." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> {{an absurd}} episode in my life, now many years ago, when I got first {{the command of}} an iron barque, loading then in a certain Eastern seaport. It was also the capital of an Eastern kingdom, lying up a river as might be London lies up this old Thames of ours. No more need {{be said of the}} place; for this sort of thing might have {{happened}} anywhere where there are ships, skippers, tugboats, and orphan nieces of indescribable splendour. And the absurdity of the episode concerns only me, my enemy Falk, and my friend Hermann.|$|E
6000|$|At every hotel we stop at {{we always}} have to send out for soap, at the last moment, when we are {{grooming}} ourselves for dinner, and they put it in the bill along with the candles and other nonsense. In Marseilles they make half the fancy toilet soap we consume in America, but the Marseillaise only have a vague theoretical idea of its use, which they have obtained from books of travel, just as they have acquired an uncertain notion of clean shirts, and the peculiarities of the gorilla, and other curious matters. <b>This</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> poor Blucher's note to the landlord in Paris: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It is unimportant," [...] she said. [...] "Nobody understands them, of course, but we {{all look}} as though we did. Something about <b>this</b> woman rather <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> our hostess." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If I {{had thought}} of it, Amy,' said Mr Dorrit, with a {{patronage}} as magnificent as that of Lord Decimus himself, 'you should have despatched a note to them, asking them to dine to-day. Some of our people could have--ha--fetched them, and taken them home. We could have spared a--hum--gondola for that purpose. I am sorry to have forgotten <b>this.</b> Pray <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> them to-morrow.' ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{not without}} regret that I took {{a last look at}} the tiny flag (it was thirty-five feet long and ten feet wide) {{fluttering}} like a lady's handkerchief from the topmost peak of Mount Davidson, two thousand feet above Virginia's roofs, and felt that doubtless I was bidding a permanent farewell to a city which had afforded me the most vigorous enjoyment of life I had ever experienced. And <b>this</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> an incident which the dullest memory Virginia could boast at the time it happened must vividly recall, at times, till its possessor dies. Late one summer afternoon we had a rain shower.|$|E
6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the {{incident}} I {{set out to}} narrate when I wrote [...] "Dimples" [...] {{at the head of}} this note. I was standing at a busy corner in a Kensington thoroughfare waiting for a bus, when a group of three ladies appeared and came to a stand a yard or two from me and waited, too, for the traffic to pass before attempting to cross to the other side. One was elderly and feeble and was holding the arm of another of the trio, who was young and pretty. Her age was perhaps twenty; she was of medium height, slim, with a nice figure and nicely dressed. She was a blonde, with light blue-grey eyes and fluffy hair of pale gold: there was little colour in her face, but the features were perfect and the mouth with its delicate curves quite beautiful.|$|E
60|$|And <b>this</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> {{one great}} {{advantage}} {{which the people}} of Holland enjoy {{on account of the}} low and level condition of their country; and that is, it is extremely easy to make canals there. There are not only no mountains or rocks in the way to impede the digging of them, but, what is perhaps a still more important advantage, there is no difficulty in filling them with water. In other countries, when a canal is to be made, the very first question is, How is it to be filled? For this purpose the engineer explores the whole country through which the canal is to pass, to find rivers and streams that he can turn into it, when the bed of it shall have been excavated; and sometimes he has to bring these supplies of water for a great distance in artificial channels, which often cross valleys by means of great aqueducts built up to hold them. Sometimes a brook is in this way brought across a river,--the river itself not being high enough to feed the canal.|$|E
6000|$|... "Industrial speculations in <b>this</b> {{province}} <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a game {{we have in}} England. Perhaps {{you have}} seen it," [...] he said, reflectively. [...] "You bet a shilling or half-a-crown that when you lift up a thimble {{you will find a}} pea you have seen a man place under it. It is not very often that you accomplish it. Still, in that case--there is--a pea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's the problem," [...] said Jolnes. [...] "My wife tied that on <b>this</b> {{morning to}} <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> {{something}} I was to send {{up to the}} house. Sit down, Whatsup, and excuse me for a few moments." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Miriam, {{it began}} with a desire for a replica <b>of</b> <b>this</b> lamp, which <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a spot {{familiar}} to my childhood. Do you remember it? Now that I have found who is the lamp's maker----" ...|$|R
