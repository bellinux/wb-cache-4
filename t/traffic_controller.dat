5|$|On 26 October 2010, a {{military}} court convicted air <b>traffic</b> <b>controller</b> Sgt. Jomarcelo Fernandes dos Santos, sentencing him to 14 {{months in jail}} for failing to take action {{when he saw that}} the Embraer's anti-collision system had been turned off. Santos will remain free pending the outcome of the appeal process. Four other controllers were acquitted for lack of proof. On 17 May 2011, Judge Mendes sentenced air <b>traffic</b> <b>controller</b> Lucivando Tiburcio de Alencar to a term of up to three years and four months but ruled he is eligible to do community service in Brazil instead and acquitted Santos on charges of harming Brazil's air transport safety.|$|E
5|$|The {{crash of}} Flight 1907 precipitated a major crisis in Brazil's civil {{aviation}} system, which included massive flight delays and cancellations, air <b>traffic</b> <b>controller</b> work-to-rule slowdowns and strikes, and public safety concerns about Brazil's airport and air traffic infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Airspace {{is shared}} by CAT, {{military}} and GA users. It is divided into controlled airspace, in which aircraft must always be {{under the control of}} an air <b>traffic</b> <b>controller,</b> and uncontrolled airspace, in which aircraft can operate autonomously. Although GA flights can under certain conditions enter controlled airspace, they operate mainly outside of it.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the National Air <b>Traffic</b> <b>Controllers</b> Association, two organizations now claim the name and part {{or all of the}} jurisdiction of the original PATCO: Professional Air <b>Traffic</b> <b>Controllers</b> Organization (AFSCME) and Professional Air <b>Traffic</b> <b>Controllers</b> Organization (2003).|$|R

5|$|Robert Kerman had {{years of}} {{experience}} working in adult films under the pseudonym R. Bolla, including the well-known Debbie Does Dallas. Kerman was recommended to Deodato for his previous film, The Concorde Affair, in which Kerman played an air <b>traffic</b> <b>controller.</b> Kerman went on to star in the Italian cannibal films Eaten Alive! and Cannibal Ferox, both directed by Umberto Lenzi. Kerman's girlfriend {{at the time was}} cast as one of the station executives, as the production needed an actress to be available in both New York City and Rome.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel {{taps into}} their {{connection}} and reveals {{that he has}} located McClane's estranged daughter, Lucy, and intends to kidnap her. McClane and Farrell race to the Woodlawn facility, where Farrell discovers that Gabriel's men are downloading all the information. He manages to encrypt the data just in time before he is captured. Gabriel kidnaps Farrell and takes him as well as Lucy, who had been kidnapped earlier, with him as his team flees from Woodlawn. McClane pursues Gabriel, hijacking his semi and enlisting Warlock to trace Gabriel's vehicle. Gabriel accesses the communication system of a U.S. Marine Corps F-35B Lightning II and, impersonating an air <b>traffic</b> <b>controller,</b> orders the pilot to attack the truck McClane is driving. McClane barely escapes, then {{makes his way to}} a nearby warehouse where Warlock has tracked Gabriel. There, Gabriel is installing the remaining files and holding Lucy and Farrell. Although McClane kills most of Gabriel's remaining henchmen, Emerson shoots him in the right shoulder.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{emergency}} personnel {{responded to the}} crash site and helped save victims. Many of those who survived were severely injured and required months or years to physically recover. NTSB investigators looked at various factors {{that contributed to the}} crash. The failures of the flight crew were cited as the probable cause of the crash, but the weather, air <b>traffic</b> <b>controller</b> performances, and FAA traffic management were also cited as contributing to the events that led to the accident. This conclusion was controversial, with disagreement between investigators, passengers, and Avianca as to who was ultimately responsible. Eventually, the U.S. government joined with Avianca and settled to pay for the damages to the victims and their families. The crash was also portrayed in a variety of media.|$|E

5000|$|Most notably, {{he was the}} {{administrator}} during an en-masse calling-in sick strike of air <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers</b> during 1969. In the summer of that year, Shaffer himself testified {{in front of a}} congressional committee, reporting that air <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers</b> were neither overworked nor underpaid. Shaffer's testimony, coupled with increased pressure on individual controllers to return to their jobs, Francis Lee Bailey of the Professional Air <b>Traffic</b> <b>Controllers</b> Organization stated [...] "This guy Shaffer has got to go." [...] The FAA and Shaffer were both later attacked by the PATCO for continuing to operate despite the low number of air <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Some {{countries}} have implemented [...] "RA downlink" [...] which provides air <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers</b> {{with information about}} RAs posted in the cockpit. Currently, there are no ICAO provisions concerning the use of RA downlink by air <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers.</b>|$|R

50|$|International Federation of Air Traffic Controllers' Associations (IFATCA) unites the {{professional}} associations of air <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers</b> {{from around the}} world.

50|$|On 3 August 1981, 12,500 air <b>traffic</b> <b>{{controllers}},</b> {{members of}} the Professional Air <b>Traffic</b> <b>Controllers</b> Organization (PATCO), walked off their jobs with the Federal Aviation Administration. President Ronald Reagan vowed to fire the controllers {{if they did not}} return to work within 48 hours. On {{the first day of the}} strike 85 percent of union controllers were out. Two days later, Reagan fired the striking controllers -- 12,000 air <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers</b> were fired on August 5.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to determin the potential genetic damage of occupational exposure to EM field. The studied subjects are engineers and air <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers</b> exposed to radio frequency emitted from different instruments. Lymphocytes of exposed and control individuals were analyzed for structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations, sister chromatid exchanges, mitotic activity and cell kinetics. Cells with structural chromosomal aberrations were significantly increased in both engineers and air <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers</b> (P< 0. 001). Also, The number of aberrant cells with total numerical aberrations increased significantly in both exposed groups (P< 0. 001). Numerical aberrations were mainly hypodiploidy. The frequencies of SCEs in engineers and air <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers</b> were slightly increased over the control but this increase was not statistically significant. A decrease in mitotic activity was reported in EM field exposed engineers and air <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers</b> at statistically significant levels of P< 0. 01 and P< 0. 001, respectively. Exposure to EM field did not affect the cell kinetics in engineers and air <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers...</b>|$|R
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} explosion, the {{aircraft}} banked {{hard to the}} right, but the autopilot quickly corrected the bank. After the blast, Captain Reyes asked Systems Engineer Dexter Comendador to survey the blast site to check for damage. Reyes placed the Mayday call, requesting landing at Naha Airport, Okinawa Island, Okinawa Prefecture. The Japanese air <b>traffic</b> <b>controller</b> experienced difficulty in trying to understand Reyes' request, so an American air <b>traffic</b> <b>controller</b> from a United States military base on Okinawa took over and processed Reyes' landing. The American air <b>traffic</b> <b>controller</b> directed a USAF Lear jet towards PAL 434 to visually check for damage of the outer fuselage and to verify that the landing gear was in place. The autopilot had stopped responding to Reyes' commands and the aircraft flew past Okinawa.|$|E

50|$|In {{conjunction}} with the slated {{construction of a new}} ATC tower at PBIA, the Federal Aviation Administration intended to transfer all of PBIA's air <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers</b> whose assigned sector is between 5 and 40 mi from the airport to a remote facility at Miami International Airport. Ground <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers,</b> and approach controllers whose sector is within 5 mi of the runway would have remained at PBIA. The FAA cited the move as a cost-cutting measure, but critics say that it creates a risk to South Florida air traffic if the Miami facility is damaged in a hurricane, or terrorist attack. The National Air <b>Traffic</b> <b>Controllers</b> Association opposed the move. The remote facility at Miami International Airport houses air <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers</b> for Miami and Fort Lauderdale international airports.|$|R
