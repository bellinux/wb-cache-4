She counts Australian Elle Macpherson and the multiracial model China Machado, the first non-White model {{to appear on the}} cover of a US fashion magazine, as her role models. She dined with Perth native and friend Heath Ledger in New York <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> died.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> died, Vainio {{had become}} friends with ice hockey coach Juhani Tamminen and dined with his family. According to Tamminen, Vainio {{had been in}} good {{condition}} at the time. The following week Tamminen learned of Vainio's death from {{a friend who had}} read about it in a Finnish newspaper.|$|E

6000|$|... “Who was Lost Face?” {{he could}} hear, in anticipation, some insolent young buck demand, “Oh, Lost Face,” {{would be the}} answer, “he who once was Makamuk in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> cut off <b>the</b> fur-thief’s head.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Haydn {{last saw}} Mozart in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> {{departed}} for London in December 1790.

5|$|Martin wakes up, having {{moved back}} to <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before.</b> <b>He</b> rushes home to try and save his wife. Martin admits to {{evidence}} suppression and that Hector Ocampo’s brother is out for revenge. Wells and his wife hide. Suddenly, they hear someone else at the door. Ocampo appears and accosts Wells. Vicky Wells comes out of hiding but is thrown through the coffee table. As Ocampo prepares to slit her throat, he is shot dead by timely arriving Doggett. Wells eventually goes to prison for his evidence suppression, a punishment he feels he deserves.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by co-creator Ian Brennan and {{directed}} by Paris Barclay, and began filming on January 5, 2012, with Martin in attendance; he had recorded his songs <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before.</b> <b>He</b> finished filming his scenes that week, ending {{early in the morning}} of January 7, 2012. The previous episode—the Michael Jackson tribute—had not yet completed, and the two episodes continued in parallel until the final Michael Jackson number was shot on January 13, 2012, the same day that the thirteenth episode commenced filming.|$|E
5|$|In his will, written <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> died, Baltimore beseeched {{his friends}} Wentworth and Cottington {{to act as}} guardians and {{supervisors}} to his first son Cecil, who inherited the title of Lord Baltimore and the imminent grant of Maryland. Baltimore's two colonies in the New World continued under the proprietorship of his family. Avalon, which remained a prime spot for the salting and export of fish, was expropriated by Sir David Kirke, with a new royal charter which Cecil Calvert vigorously challenged, and it was finally absorbed into Newfoundland in 1754. Although Baltimore's failed Avalon venture {{marked the end of}} an early era of attempts at proprietary colonisation, it laid the foundation upon which permanent settlements developed in that region of Newfoundland.|$|E

60|$|The hermit {{walked back}} to the hermitage. At the door stood Bob Binkley, his old friend and {{companion}} of <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> had renounced <b>the</b> world--Bob, himself, arrayed like the orchids of the greenhouse in the summer man's polychromatic garb--Bob, the millionaire, with his fat, firm, smooth, shrewd face, his diamond rings, sparkling fob-chain, and pleated bosom. He was two years older than the hermit, and looked five years younger.|$|R
60|$|She {{was very}} peculiar--that was very true; yet Bernard held to his {{declaration}} of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before</b> that <b>he</b> now understood her a little.|$|R
5|$|More {{problems}} ensued during filming: Paul Le Mat {{was sent}} to the hospital after an allergic reaction to walnuts. Le Mat, Harrison Ford and Bo Hopkins were claimed to be drunk most nights and every weekend, and had conducted climbing competitions {{to the top of the}} local Holiday Inn sign. One actor set fire to Lucas's motel room. Another night, Le Mat threw Richard Dreyfuss into a swimming pool, gashing Dreyfuss' forehead on <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was due to have his close-ups filmed. Dreyfuss also complained over the wardrobe that Lucas had chosen for the character. Ford was kicked out of his motel room at the Holiday Inn. In addition, two camera operators were nearly killed when filming the climactic race scene on Frates Road outside Petaluma. Principal photography ended on August 4, 1972.|$|E
5|$|The divorce {{meant that}} Skelton {{had lost his}} married man's deferment; he was once again {{classified}} as 1-A for service. He was drafted into the army in early 1944; both MGM and his radio sponsor tried to obtain a deferment for the comedian, but to no avail. His last Raleigh radio show was on June 6, 1944, <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was formally inducted as a private; he was not assigned to Special Services at that time. Without its star, the program was discontinued, and the opportunity presented itself for the Nelsons to begin a radio show of their own, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet.|$|E
5|$|The {{gains of}} the North Koreans {{in the east}} on September 4 caused Walker to shift still more troops to that area. <b>The</b> <b>day</b> <b>before,</b> <b>he</b> had ordered the US 24th Infantry Division to move from its reserve {{position}} near Taegu to the lower Naktong River to relieve the US 1st Provisional Marine Brigade in the Naktong Bulge area of the US 2nd Infantry Division front. It bivouacked that night {{on the banks of}} the Naktong near Susan-nil. On the morning of the 4th, before it could begin relief of the US Marine Corps forces there, the 24th Infantry Division received a new order to proceed to Kyongju. The assistant division commander, Brigadier General Garrison H. Davidson, proceeding at once by jeep, arrived at Kyongju that evening. Division troops and the US 19th Infantry Regiment started at 13:00 the next day, September 5, and, traveling over muddy roads, most of them arrived at Kyongju just before midnight. Major General John H. Church, the 24th Division commander, had arrived there during the day. All division units had arrived by 07:00, September 6.|$|E
5000|$|On February 5, 2010, the Alaska Court of Appeals {{overturned}} Linehan's conviction. The court concluded it was improper for {{the trial}} court to allow two pieces of evidence into the trial: testimony about the movie The Last Seduction, and a letter written by Leppink in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> died. <b>The</b> letter, which Leppink wrote to his parents, said Linehan, Carlin, or Scott Hilke were [...] "probably" [...] responsible if he died under [...] "suspicious circumstances".|$|R
50|$|From June 1944 {{he worked}} on Talk Between Ships (TBS). On <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before</b> D-Day, <b>he</b> had worked on HMS Bulolo, which had {{directed}} the landings off Gold Beach.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{remember}} Prince Rosmaran?" [...] {{she said}} to Bellamy. [...] "He left Servia only <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before</b> yesterday. <b>He</b> has come to England on a special mission to the King." ...|$|R

25|$|On 2 October 2012, Saakashvili {{admitted}} {{defeat in}} Georgia's parliamentary election against Bidzina Ivanishvili {{in the election}} <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before.</b> <b>He</b> was barred from seeking a third term in the 2013 presidential election. Saakashvili left Georgia shortly after the election.|$|E
25|$|A 31-year-old Geelong man {{was charged}} with the assault. However, he was {{reported}} to have committed suicide on 10 July 2006 by jumping from a Melbourne high rise apartment block, <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was due to appear before the Geelong Magistrates court to defend the assault charges.|$|E
2500|$|Slightly– Slightly is {{the most}} {{conceited}} because he believes <b>he</b> remembers <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was [...] "lost". He is the only Lost Boy who [...] "knows" [...] his last name– he says his pinafore had the words [...] "Slightly Soiled" [...] written on the tag. He cuts whistles from the branches of trees, and dances to tunes he creates himself. Slightly is, apparently, a poor make-believer. He blows big breaths when he feels he is in trouble, and he eventually leads to Peter's almost-downfall.|$|R
6000|$|Martin {{laid down}} the letter and worked a problem in mental arithmetic, finding the product of fifteen cents times sixty {{thousand}} to be nine thousand dollars. He signed the new contract, inserting [...] "The Smoke of Joy" [...] in the blank space, and mailed {{it back to the}} publishers along with the twenty storiettes he had written in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> discovered <b>the</b> formula for the newspaper storiette. And promptly as the United States mail could deliver and return, came Singletree, Darnley & Co.'s check for five thousand dollars.|$|R
60|$|March {{told him}} what he had {{forgotten}} to tell him <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before,</b> though <b>he</b> had been trying, all through their excited talk, to get it in, that the Dryfooses were going abroad.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> died, Labre {{collapsed}} in the church of Santa Maria ai Monti, blocks from the Colosseum, and despite his protestations was charitably taken to a house behind the church at Via dei Serpenti 2. He died there of malnutrition on 16 April 1783, during Holy Week, and {{was buried in the}} Church of Santa Maria ai Monti.|$|E
25|$|Holmes listens {{carefully}} to Helen’s story and agrees {{to take the}} case. He plans {{a visit to the}} manor later in <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> <b>Before</b> <b>he</b> can leave, however, he is visited by Dr. Roylott himself, who threatens him should he interfere. Undaunted, Holmes proceeds, first to the courthouse, where he examines Helen’s late mother’s will, and then to the countryside.|$|E
25|$|In April 2017, the zoo's male Rothschild giraffe Zabulu, {{had to be}} euthanised. 19-year-old Zabulu {{had been}} unwell, but {{deteriorated}} rapidly <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> died. Despite the efforts of all involved, Zabulu's welfare {{and quality of life}} could not be maintained and he was euthanised. Zabulu fathered 15 giraffe calves in his life. This leaves Auckland Zoo with a single-sex giraffe herd of three females.|$|E
50|$|Gaddie died on Monday, November 13, 1911. He preached at Sunday {{services}} <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before</b> when <b>he</b> took ill. Physicians pronounced his {{trouble to}} be acute indigestion. Gaddie {{was buried in}} Eastern Cemetery in Louisville.|$|R
60|$|Philip {{had known}} the passage {{perfectly}} <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before,</b> but now <b>he</b> could remember nothing.|$|R
50|$|Hatab was {{in custody}} {{for only a}} few days. Hatab was interrogated by a {{military}} intelligence officer <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was killed. He was also looked at by a medic who stated that Hatab appeared to have suffered a mild heart attack. The medic also suggested Hatab might be faking it. In <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> died Hatab was observed being unsteady on his feet. He was observed spontaneously falling over and landing on a bale of razor wire. He appeared dazed. He had completely lost control of his bowels, and his clothes were covered in excrement.|$|R
25|$|Long {{rumored to}} have Presidential ambitions, O'Malley {{publicly}} announced his candidacy in the 2016 presidential election on May 30, 2015, in Baltimore, after filing his candidacy forms seeking the Democratic Party presidential nomination with the Federal Election Commission <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before.</b> <b>He</b> struggled to attract significant support as one of three major party candidates, however, and eight months later on February 1, 2016, he suspended his campaign after finishing third in the Iowa caucuses.|$|E
25|$|The court {{heard that}} the Goughs' {{contract}} required them to bring up Dennis O'Neill {{as one of their}} own children in return for £1 per week. The court heard much the same testimony as in the committal hearings. However, it appeared that Terence had initially been somewhat confused about the sequence of events. The prosecution claimed that Dennis was tied to a bench and beaten with a stick for eating a swede <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> died.|$|E
25|$|Showgirl June Brice {{had been}} seen talking to Crater <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> disappeared. A lawyer acting for Crater's wife {{believed}} that Brice {{had been at the}} center of a scheme to blackmail Crater (thus explaining why Crater had taken cash out of the bank) and that a gangster boyfriend of Brice had killed the judge. Brice disappeared the day that a grand jury was to convene on the case. In 1948, she was discovered in a mental hospital.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was from}} a live Motortown Revue {{performance}} that Little Stevie Wonder got his first big hit, the 1963 #1 hit [...] "Fingertips (Pt. 2)". Motown CEO Berry Gordy, Jr. noted in his biography, To Be Loved, that the Revue was used to showcase Stevie Wonder in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> had his first hit. Also, Smokey Robinson and the other Miracles composed songs such as [...] "The Way You Do the Things You Do" [...] and [...] "My Girl" [...] while on the road, which later became hits for The Temptations. The Miracles, Motown's first star act, always closed the show.|$|R
60|$|But, strive as he would, Smoke {{could get}} no clew to Snass's history in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> {{came to live}} in the {{northern}} wilds. Educated he was, yet in all the intervening years he had read no books, no newspapers. What had happened in the world he knew not, nor did he show desire to know. He had heard of the miners on the Yukon, and of the Klondike strike. Gold-miners had never invaded his territory, for which he was glad. But the outside world to him did not exist. He tolerated no mention of it.|$|R
50|$|Robin Söderling {{was forced}} to {{withdraw}} from the tournament on <b>the</b> second <b>day,</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was due to face Russia's Evgeny Korolev on day three. He was replaced by Frenchman Marc Gicquel who entered the tournament as a lucky loser.|$|R
