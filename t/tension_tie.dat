40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} research, {{performed}} at McGill University, on the experimental responses of four deep beams forming {{part of a}} larger research program involving eight deep beams. The other four beams are reported by BouSaleh (2006). The beams reported in this thesis were tested in an attempt to obtain crushing at the support nodal zones through the provisions of inadequate bearing area for beams with different <b>tension</b> <b>tie</b> anchorage details. In order to study the influence of different anchorages of the main <b>tension</b> <b>tie,</b> the beams were designed with the same strut-and-tie model in accordance with the CSA Standard (2004). The four full-scale simply supported deep beams had similar dimensions of 1000 mm in height, 350 mm in thickness, and a span of 2000 mm centre-to-centre between the supports. The four beams contained two layers of five 15 M reinforcement. However, the length of each specimen varied according to the different anchorage details. The <b>tension</b> <b>tie</b> reinforcement anchored by straight bar embedment resulted in the longest beam. Identical overall lengths were provided for the specimens anchored using 90 ° standard hooks and friction-welded headed bars of head size 1. 5 in. (38 mm). Finally, the shortest beam was anchored using friction welded headed bars of 2 in. (50 mm) head size. The beam containing hooked anchorages performed better than the beam with straight bar embedment, with higher capacity and ductility. The reduced head size friction-welded headed bars, further anchored with a lead-in length, resulted in a higher nodal zone bearing stresses, better confinement for the concrete and higher ductility compared to the straight bar embedment and the hooked anchorage. The friction-welded headed bars having heads with an area equal to ten times the bar area not only reduced the length of the beam significantly and were capable of developing the full yield strength of the bar at the inner side of the head. The beam with full size heads achieved a higher capacity than the beam with the straight bar embedment and reached about the same capacity as the beam with hooked end anchorage. This research also demonstrates the beneficial effect of the confining transverse pressure provided at the support nodal zones by the support reactions, in improving the bond. This effect resulted in higher bar stresses than those predicted using the CSA and ACI code development length expressions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Future {{reusable}} launch vehicles may be lifting {{bodies with}} non-circular cross section like the proposed Lockheed-Martin VentureStarª. Current {{designs for the}} cryogenic tanks of these vehicles are dual-lobed and quad-lobed tanks which are packaged more efficiently than circular tanks, but still have low packaging efficiencies with large gaps existing between the vehicle outer mold line and the outer surfaces of the tanks. In this study, tanks that conform to the outer mold line of a non-circular vehicle were investigated. Four structural concepts for conformal cryogenic tanks and a quad-lobed tank concept were optimized for minimum weight designs. The conformal tank concepts included a sandwich tank stiffened with axial tension webs, a sandwich tank stiffened with transverse tension webs, a sandwich tank stiffened with rings and <b>tension</b> <b>ties,</b> and a sandwich tank stiffened with orthogrid stiffeners and <b>tension</b> <b>ties.</b> For each concept, geometric parameters (such as ring frame spacing, the number and spacing of <b>tension</b> <b>ties</b> or webs, and tank corner radius) and internal pressure loads were varied and the structure was optimized using a finite-element-based optimization procedure.

40|$|On May 6, 2010, NASA {{launched}} {{the first successful}} integrated flight test, Pad Abort- 1, of the Orion Project from the White Sands Missile Range in Las Cruces, New Mexico. This test demonstrated the ability to perform an emergency pad abort of a full-scale 4. 8 m diameter, 8200 kg crew capsule. During development of the critical separation mechanisms for this flight test, various challenges were overcome related to environments definition, installation complications, separation joint retraction speed, thruster ordnance development issues, load path validation and significant design loads increases. The Launch Abort System retention and release (LAS R&R) mechanism consisted of 6 discrete structural connections between the LAS and the crew module (CM) simulator, each of which had a preloaded <b>tension</b> <b>tie,</b> Superbolt torque-nut and frangible nut. During the flight test, the frangible nuts were pyrotechnically split, permitting the CM to separate from the LAS. The LAS separation event was the driving case in the shock environment for many co-located hardware items. During development testing, {{it was necessary to}} measure the source shock during the separation event so the predicted shock environment could be validated and used for certification testing of multiple hardware items. The Lockheed Martin test team measured the source separation shock due to the LAS R&R function, which dramatically decreased the predicted environment by 90 % at 100 Hz. During development testing a hydraulic tensioner was used to preload the joint; however, the joint relaxation with the tensioner proved unsatisfactory so the design was modified to include a Superbolt torque-nut. The observed preload creep during lab testing was 4 % after 30 days, with 2. 5 % occurring in the first 24 hours. The conversion of strain energy (preload) to kinetic energy (retraction) was measured to be 50 - 75 %. Design features and careful monitoring of multiple strain gauges on each <b>tension</b> <b>tie</b> allowed a pure tensile load to be applied after stacking at the launch pad. Following installation, preload in each joint was monitored for 24 hours. Due to unforeseen complications and the influence of temperature on the portable data acquisition system, the team encountered difficulty in tracking the joint relaxation.

40|$|The shear {{capacity}} of reinforced concrete pier caps in existing bridge support {{systems can be}} a factor which limits the {{capacity of}} an existing bridge. In their usual configuration, pier caps behave as deep beams and {{have the ability to}} carry load through tied arch action after the formation of diagonal cracks. Externally bonded fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcement has been shown to increase the shear capacity of reinforced concrete members which carry load through beam action. However, there is an insufficient amount of research to make it a viable strengthening system for beams which carry load through arch action, such as pier caps. Accordingly, this research was aimed at investigating the behavior of reinforced concrete pier caps through a coordinated experimental and analytical program and to recommend an external strengthening method for pier caps with perceived deficiencies in shear strength. The experimental study was performed on laboratory specimens based on an existing bridge in Georgia. A number of factors were examined, including size, percentage longitudinal reinforcement and crack control reinforcement. The results showed that increasing the longitudinal tension reinforcement increased the beam capacity by changing the shape of the tied arch. In contrast, the presence of crack control reinforcement did not change the point at which diagonal cracking occurred, but it did increase the ultimate capacity by reinforcing the concrete against splitting. The results of the experimental study were used in conjunction with a larger database to examine different analytical methods for estimating the ultimate capacity of deep beams, and a new method was developed for the design of external strengthening. Two specimens were tested with externally bonded FRP reinforcement applied longitudinally to increase the strength of the <b>tension</b> <b>tie.</b> The test results correlated well with the proposed method of analysis and showed that increasing the strength of the longitudinal <b>tension</b> <b>tie</b> is an effective way to increase the strength of a reinforced concrete deep beam.

Four beams were tested by Li (2003) and this thesis reports on the testing of the remaining four beams. The deep beams reported in this thesis were 2000 mm long by 400 mm thick. Two beams had an overall depth of 520 mm {{and the other two}} beams had an overall depth of 810 mm. Two beams were reinforced with main <b>tension</b> <b>tie</b> reinforcement only, while the other two contained both vertical and horizontal uniformly distributed reinforcement. These beams were tested under concentrated load to investigate the influence of span-to-depth ratio and the influence of uniformly distributed horizontal and vertical reinforcement. The presence of uniformly distributed steel resulted in higher capacities, better crack control and also served to control bond splitting failures near the supports. Four approaches were used to predict the capacities: a plane-section model, a simplified strut-and-tie model, a model based on the 1996 FIP Recommendations and a refined strut-and-tie model. The 1996 FIP (Federation Internationale de la Precontrainte) Recommendations gave conservative predictions suitable for design.

40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to report on the comparison between different nondestructive test (NDT) methods applied for the detection of defects in welds. NDT methods such as Ultrasonic Testing (UT), Magnetic Particle Testing (MT) and Radiographic Testing (RT) may be applied for the detection of surface and subsurface defects in steel bridge members. However, each of these technologies may have a different response to the same defect, based on the physics of the technology. As a result, test results may vary between each of the techniques. Critical defects such as cracks may be detected by one technology, but not by another, leading to inconsistent results and undermining confidence in the test results. Inconsistencies between MT, UT and RT were identified in the study. In this research, MT, RT, and UT results from the inspection of the Sherman Minton Bridge were compared with physical test results obtained from cores taken at 21 different locations across the bridge. Comparisons for surface breaking cracks and subsurface defects (including cracks) were provided. This research also evaluated the limitations of MT, RT, and UT methods regarding defect types and disposition in welds and their locations on the <b>tension</b> <b>tie</b> chord of the bridge. It was presented through the study that RT missed many planar flaws compared with UT and laboratory results. The number of flaws detected by UT at the core locations was higher than any other method.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} program was to study the behaviour of full-scale deep beams with realistic reinforcement details. In the overall research program, a total of eight deep beams were tested. A companion study by Li (2003) {{presents the results of}} four of these beams. This research examines the other four beams, two without uniformly distributed crack control reinforcement and two with distributed horizontal and vertical reinforcement. The specimens' dimensions were 2000 mm long and 400 mm thick, with two specimens having heights of 1160 mm and the other two heights of 1840 mm. The specimens were loaded with a central loading plate 300 mm long and 400 mm wide. The end bearing plates were 250 mm long and 400 mm wide. All specimens contained seven 15 M bars forming the main <b>tension</b> <b>tie</b> reinforcement. The test results provided information on the influence of the uniformly distributed reinforcement and the crack and strain development up to failure. The ductility of the specimens containing only the main tension ties was limited due to the formation of splitting cracks along the anchorages of the main tension ties during the later stages of testing. The uniformly distributed reinforcement provided additional tension ties that increased the capacity and the ductility. Strut-and-tie models were developed to predict the capacities. The FIP Recommendations (FIP 1996) were used to determine the contributions of the two major mechanisms, direct strut action and indirect strut action. This approach gave very conservative strength predictions. More refined strut-and-tie models were developed for the specimens with uniformly distributed reinforcement.

40|$|Project (M. S., Civil Engineering (Structural Engineering)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. This report, Development of Preliminary Strut-Tie Models for Precast Bent Cap Connections (Cast-in-place and Grouted Duct), {{develops}} strut-tie models (STM) for precast bent cap-column connections {{using the}} NCHRP 12 - 74 Grouted Duct (GD) and Cast-in-Place (CIP) specimens. In {{development of these}} STM???s, the bent cap bar strains from the specimens were compared against three theoretical models: beam theory, 2 D strut-tie models, and 3 D strut-tie models. 	The beam theory analysis used statics, moment-curvature analysis, and actual material properties of the specimens to determine the theoretical bent cap bar strains. The 2 D STM, based on the modified external strut force transfer model (EFTM) proposed in the literature, was established using the computer aided strut-and-tie (CAST) program. Through an iterative process, a refined 2 D STM was developed for both the push and pull test directions by comparing specimen strain data to CAST output. An important modification to the EFTM-based STM was {{the addition of a}} <b>tension</b> <b>tie</b> at the bottom cap face (as tested) for the pull direction. This corresponded to tension strain present in test data and made the CAST model stable. Based on the 2 D STM, the 3 D STM was created in the SAP 2000 structural analysis program. The 3 D STM incorporates out-of-plane effects related to actual column bar positions and allows a more accurate representation of the two primary mechanisms assumed in anchoring column tension forces: clamping mechanism and splice transfer mechanism. 	The beam theory results included limited comparisons of actual-to-theoretical flexural strains for two locations adjacent to the joint, top vs. bottom bars, and CIP vs. GD specimens. The average percent differences of the actual to the theoretical strains for the CIP was 49 and 146 for the compression bar, 12 inches away from the cap face and at the cap face, respectively. Over the entire range of loading stages, differences in actual-to-theoretical strains were generally larger for locations closer to the joint, indicating a more pronounced local disturbance compared to locations further away from the joint. Bars that were in compression for most of the loading sequences exhibited a much closer match to theoretical strains than bars that were primarily subjected to tension. Local cracking and other effects are believed to have influenced gage readings. CIP and GD strains for the same locations generally displayed similar trends and values, especially for bars in compression. 	Compared to beam theory, results of the 2 D STM analysis indicated a closer correlation between actual and theoretical strain. The difference between actual and theoretical strains for the CIP specimen were limited to 28 percent and averaged approximately 16 percent for both push and pull directions. For the GD specimen, the differences were as large as 44 percent except for one location, which reached a 98 percent difference. On average, the differences averaged 27 percent in the push direction and the 45 percent in the pull direction. This increased accuracy reflects the more realistic representation of the flow of forces within a joint and their effects. 	The 3 D STM showed the closest correlation between the test data and theoretical analysis. Actual to theoretical strains for the 3 D STM???s differed by no more than 42 percent and only 14 percent on average. These values were smaller than for any other analytical method. The reason is because the 3 D mechanisms associated with anchoring the column tension force were more accurately detailed and accounted for in the 3 D model. 	Conclusions from these analyses include: 1) beam theory does not accurately represent strains that develop in longitudinal reinforcement at the face of CIP and precast bent cap joints; 2) the limit of the disturbed (D) region appears to extend a distance of approximately half of the bent cap depth (hb/ 2) {{from the face of the}} joint; 3) the developed 2 D STM, including the additional <b>tension</b> <b>tie,</b> provides a reasonably simple and accurate model for the flow of forces through a bent cap joint using CIP or GD connections; 4) the modified EFTM requires an additional <b>tension</b> <b>tie</b> in the pull direction to accurately represent tension that develops in the exterior face of bent caps; 5) the developed 3 D STM is the most complicated yet accurate model for analyzing joint forces and associated reinforcement strain in a CIP or precast bent cap joint; 6) the presence of ducts in the GD specimen did not noticeably affect specimen strain values compared to the CIP specimen nor affect the development or results of the 2 D or 3 D STM???s; and 7) analytical results from this study do not indicate the need for any changes to existing NCHRP 12 - 74 recommendations for non-integral precast bent caps using CIP or GD connections. 	Based on results of this analysis, the following are recommended for future study: 1) perform finite element analysis (FEA) of the CIP and GD specimens in the pull direction to confirm the need for the additional tension tie; 2) further develop the 2 D STM, with special focus on determination of strains in the joint hoops and joint stirrups (interior and exterior) and comparison to test data; 3) perform FEA for CIP and GD precast bent caps to validate the three splice transfer mechanisms and their impact on joint behavior; and 4) incorporate data from the CSUS Preliminary Grouted Duct specimen to supplement these analytical results.

All of the deep beams had a centre-to-centre spacing of 2000 mm between the two supports, 1000 mm in height, and 350 mm in thickness. They were simply supported with an application of a single point load at midspan. The total length of the four beams varies {{depending on the type of}} anchorage being used. The four anchorage details that were considered in this study include a straight development length, a standard 90 degree hook, friction-welded 1. 5 in.

KramerStrut-and-Tie {{models are}} useful in {{designing}} reinforced concrete structures with discontinuity regions where linear stress distribution is not valid. Deep beams are typically short girders with a large point load or multiple point loads. These point loads, {{in conjunction with the}} depth and length of the members, contribute to a member with primarily discontinuity regions. ACI 318 - 08 Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete provides a method for designing deep beams using either Strut-and-Tie models (STM) or Deep Beam Method (DBM). This report compares dimension requirements, concrete quantities, steel quantities, and constructability of the two methods through the design of three different deep beams. The three designs consider the same single span deep beam with varying height and loading patterns. The first design is a single span deep beam with a large point load at the center girder. The second design is the deep beam with the same large point load at a quarter point of the girder. The last design is the deep beam with half the load at the midpoint and the other half at the quarter point. These three designs allow consideration of different shear and STM model geometry and design considerations. Comparing the two different designs shows the shear or cracking control reinforcement reduces by an average 13 % because the STM considers the extra shear capacity through arching action. The tension steel used for either flexure or the <b>tension</b> <b>tie</b> increases by an average of 16 % from deep beam in STM design. This is due to STM taking shear force through tension in the tension reinforcement through arching action. The main advantage of the STM is the ability to decreased member depth without decreasing shear reinforcement spacing. If the member depth is not a concern in the design, the preferred method is DBM unless the designer is familiar with STMs due to the similarity of deep beam and regular beam design theory...|$|E

Non-linear finite element analyses {{have been made to}} gain a better understanding ofthe 'mechanisms of tension stiffening in tension members and slabs. Laboratory tests have been carried out to gather information on the cracking moment, the mean moment resisted by cracked concrete (derived from strain measurements and back analysis of deflecti~n data) and influence ofpeak construction loading on deflection. Nine tests on slabs have provided data on the cracking moment of slab compared with companion beams. Mean surface strains were measured' in the constant moment region of the slabs with a Demec gauge. These strains were used to determine the position of neutral axis and the curvature which was also determined from a back analysis of deflection data measured by transducers. The mean strain in the reinforcement over the constant moment region is obtained by assuming it equals the mean surface strain at the level of reinforcement. An improved method is developed for taking account of construction loading in deflection calculations with EC 2. Crack spacing and crack width were two phenomena which were measured and taken into account for non-linear fInite element analysis made in parallel with experiment. Numerical investigation into mechanisms Jor tension stiffening has been carried out with non linear fInite element analys'is 'of tension spec'imens and beams with discrete cracks and bond slip. The output from the one-dimensional analys~s includes crack spacings, distribution of bond stress, slip, tensile stress in concrete, tensile stress in reinforcement and load-displacement.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of an investigation into the evaluation of a selected test bridge using instrumentation to obtain site-specific factors contributing to the evaluation, with the ultimate objective of improving the estimate of the bridge’s reliability in order to assess allowable loading more accurately. The experimental portion of the research program involved instrumenting the test bridge with strain gauges, and recording field measurements using two forms of loading. The analytical portion of the research program involved the analysis of the bridge in the as-designed state, based on the design drawings and specification, followed by a re-analysis of the bridge using the site-specific factors measured on-site. The bridge was evaluated using methods outlined in the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code CAN/CSA-S 6 - 00 (CSA 2000). The test bridge is located near the community of Hudson Bay, Saskatchewan. The bridge is constructed of steel-reinforced concrete, and there are three, three-span arch-shaped girders. There are also external steel bars added after initial construction to increase the midspan bending moment resistance. In total, 45 strain gauges were placed on the middle spans of the three girders to record strain induced by two forms of loading: controlled loading, in which a truck of known weight and dimensions was driven over the bridge in a number of pre-determined configurations, and in-situ loading, in which normal truck traffic was used. The current allowable loading on the bridge is a gross vehicle weight of 62. 5 t, although increasing the allowable loading to 110 t has been proposed, along with two strengthening alternatives to make this increased loading feasible. To provide a base-line analysis for comparison purposes, the bridge was first evaluated based strictly on information taken from the design drawings and specifications. The evaluation was performed using the load and resistance factor method, in which load and resistance factors were used to account for uncertainty, {{as well as by the}} mean load method, in which statistical properties of the variable’s parameters included in the design were used to account for uncertainty. The result of the load and resistance factor method was a live load capacity factor, indicating the overall “rating” of the bridge. In addition to the live load capacity factor, the mean load method was also used to determine the reliability index. The results of the as-designed analysis showed that the mean load method gave more conservative estimates of the bridge capacity. Furthermore, it was determined that, based on these assessments, the bridge would not have sufficient capacity to carry the proposed 110 t truck loads. The bridge was re-evaluated using site-specific factors with the mean load method. Using the measured strains, statistical parameters were determined for live load effects, distribution factors, dynamic load allowance, and resistance. Statistical parameters that could not be obtained readily through testing were obtained from the literature. The results indicated that code-predicted estimates of a number of factors were highly conservative. Flexural and shear load effects in the girders were found to be less than 15 % of the theoretical predictions, as a result of apparent arching action in the girders, generating significant axial forces. For this arching action to occur, horizontal restraint was required at the supports, either through unanticipated restraint in the bearings, or <b>tension</b> <b>tie</b> action of the tensile girder reinforcement. Furthermore, the dynamic amplification was found to be less than 1. 0. The resulting reliability indices indicated that the bridge would be safe under the proposed increased allowable loading (110 t). Finite element models were used to confirm the dynamic amplification observations and examine the effects of different degrees of bearing restraint. The model showed results similar to those measured for dynamic amplification. It was found that if the bearings were to become completely fixed against horizontal translation, the bridge would become overloaded as a result of increased shear effects, demonstrating the need for proper bearing maintenance. An analysis of relative costs was completed to determine the most cost-effective solution for hauling logs. Assumptions were made regarding truck and maintenance and operating costs. The results indicated that the most economic solution was to use the method outlined in the research to increase the allowable loading on the bridge to 110 t, over the strengthening alternatives and simply leaving the bridge in the current state...|$|E

He had under-designed the {{structure}} and used brittle cast iron for critical components, especially the lugs which held <b>tensioned</b> <b>tie</b> bars in the towers. It was these lugs which fractured first and destabilised the towers in the high girders section. The bolt holes in the lugs were cast, and had a conical section, so all the load was concentrated at a sharp outer edge. Such conical bolt holes were used for critical horizontal strut lugs as well, and weakened the structure substantially. The towers of the high girder section were heavily loaded and were very top heavy, making then susceptible to toppling. The towers failed during the storm as the train was travelling over, and a chain reaction followed as each of the towers in the high girders section collapsed. In 1887 the bridge was replaced by William Henry Barlow with a much more substantial bridge, which {{was at that time}} the longest railway bridge in Europe, at just over 2 mi long (Europe's longest bridge today is the Oresund Bridge).|$|R
40|$|AbstractNowadays, the {{strengthening}} of existing buildings {{represents one of the}} most innovative fields within current research in civil engineering. Among the developed techniques, a recent solution consists in the use of FRCM composites (Fabric Reinforced Cementitious Matrix), which are obtained by placing a dry grid of fibers inside a cement-based material (mortar). In comparison with traditional systems, the use of FRCM seems to provide some advantages; however, a full understanding of the mechanical properties of each component (mortar and fibers) and of their interaction, as well as their effect on the strengthened structure, still represents an open research topic. This work aims to be a first attempt to numerically simulate the global behavior of FRCM composites through the development of a macroscopic constitutive model subsequently implemented into a Non-Linear Finite Element (NLFE) procedure. The effectiveness of the proposed procedure is verified through comparisons with significant experimental results available in technical literature, relative to FRCM <b>tension</b> <b>ties.</b> The influence exerted by the adoption of different materials (such as Poliparafenilenbenzobisoxazolo (PBO) and carbon) for the internal fiber grid on the global behavior is also analyzed and discussed...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of various}} {{parameters}} governing bond behavior is investigated {{in this paper}} {{taking advantage of a}} simple but efficient finite-element model, whose fundamental aspects are briefly recalled. Several well-documented test results on bond are examined in order to clarify the relevance of some aspects of bond phenomenological behavior, and to study a few bond situations where testing has been scarce in the past, {{as in the case of}} push-in tests. Parametric studies are performed as well, with reference to the loading mode (pull-out and push-in), to bar elastic and strain-hardening moduli, to steel yield strength and to bar lateral contraction/expansion, both in the elastic and in the plastic domain. Beside contributing to a better understanding of the role of the above-mentioned parameters, the paper confirms at the same time the uniqueness of the local bond stress-slip law, and the necessity of introducing a corrective factor, in order to take care of the damage to bond caused by the cone-shaped microcracks radiating from the bar close to the transverse cracks in <b>tension</b> <b>ties</b> and to the flexural cracks in R/C beams subjected to bending...|$|R
40|$|The {{dramatic}} rise in AIDS-related {{deaths in}} South Africa {{in recent years}} is making funerals a prominent part of the cultural and economic landscape. In rural communities such as Hamburg, in the Eastern Cape, they tend to cost at least five times the monthly income of the entire household. Based on seven months of fieldwork, this thesis explores how funerals are conducted in Hamburg, as well as many people's ambivalence about the seemingly necessary expense involved. Funerals are found to be a site of <b>tension</b> <b>tied</b> to gender, inter-generational relations and material inequalities. They also reveal the extent to which HIV/AIDS is still taboo. At the same time, they perform an important cohesive role, helping to keep the community together in the face of difficult realties. Using the twinned cultural norms of 'helping each other' and `building the homestead,' the thesis examines the ways in which funerals are materially and symbolically engaged in a complex choreography that both contains and explores the potentially disruptive aspects of the present. Finally, it is shown how local practices and understandings related to funerals speak to broader issues in the building of a new South Africa...|$|R

40|$|Because of {{nonlinear}} strain distributions caused {{either by}} abrupt changes in geometry or in loading in deep beam, the approach for conventional beams is not applicable. Consequently, strut-and-tie model (STM) {{has been applied}} as the most rational and simple method for strength prediction and design of reinforced concrete deep beams. A deep beam is idealized by the STM as a truss-like structure consisting of diagonal concrete struts and <b>tension</b> <b>ties.</b> There have been numerous works proposing the STMs for deep beams. However, uncertainty and complexity in shear strength computations of deep beams {{can be found in}} some STMs. Therefore, improvement of methods for predicting the shear strengths of deep beams are still needed. By means of a large experimental database of 406 deep beam test results covering a wide range of influencing parameters, several shapes and geometry of STM and six state-of-the-art formulation of the efficiency factors found in the design codes and literature, the new STMs for predicting the shear strength of simply supported reinforced concrete deep beams using multiple linear regression analysis is proposed in this paper. Furthermore, the regression diagnostics and the validation process are included in this study. Finally, two numerical examples are also provided for illustration. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of the concrete floor {{presented in this paper}} consists of a thin funicular vault, quadrilateral in plan, supported on its four corners, and stiffened by a system of “ribs ” walls on its extrados. The structural prototype is completed with <b>tension</b> <b>ties,</b> which link the supports and absorb the horizontal thrusts of the funicular shell. It is a prototype for the NEST-HiLo project to be realized late 2015 in Dübendorf, Switzerland. The solution is inspired by built examples in tile vaulting in which thin vaults are stiffened by diaphragms, also called spandrel walls. In the presented structure, this structural system is implemented and constructed in high-performance concrete to achieve an extreme thinness (2 cm in the case of this prototype for both vault and ribs) and to resist asymmetrical loading. This floor would thus save more than 70 % of weight compared to traditional, 25 - 30 cm thick concrete floor slabs used in the construction of framed buildings. This directly lowers the requirements for the foundations (often a dominant resource and cost factor), but also enables lightweight building extensions and a reduction of total floor height, offering possibilities to address, among other issues, the vertical densification of cities. A form-finding and analysis procedure for the design of such floor systems is presented, which consists of consecutive topology, shape and size optimizations...|$|R

40|$|Full-scale {{exterior}} beam-column-slab sub-assemblages {{were tested}} under reversed cyclic loading {{to investigate the}} role or the spandrel beam in the overall response. Results from specimens having different spandrel beam sizes and different amounts of torsional reinforcement in the spandrel beams provided {{a better understanding of}} their behaviour. The test specimens were heavily instrumented to enable detailed strain measurements in the slab bars, the joint region and the spandrel beam. These strains together with the crack pattern provide some insight into the flow of forces from the slab and spandrel beam into the joint region. The tests show that the effective width of the slab contributing to the negative bending of the main beam is affected by the torsional yielding of the spandrel beam. However, after this yielding, a different force mechanism, involving concrete compressive struts, and <b>tension</b> <b>ties</b> in the slab and spandrel beam bars, provides means of transferring additional forces from the slab bars to the joint region. It is important to consider the effect of these forces since they increase the negative moment capacity of the beams, and hence, they may affect the hierarchy of yielding between the columns and the beams. This effect may in turn alter the failure mode of the structure. Tentative design proposals, accounting for the flow of forces through the spandrel beam, are presented. The application of these proposals are illustrated for a number of different specimens having varying spandrel beam dimensions...|$|R
