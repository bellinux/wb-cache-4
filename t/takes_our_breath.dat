As poet and critic Gregory Woods wrote on this book, [...] "his first person is singularly hard to pin down, apparently detached while involved, precise while vague, inventing stuff while accurately recording memory. The voices he adopts comment wryly on {{a world in which}} nothing could surprise us, even while everything <b>takes</b> <b>our</b> <b>breath</b> away. The reader finds she has to check the ground beneath her feet." ...|$|E

We like to look at every different way of making it, it can be very simple or very complicated, but we don't feel satisfied until we've both given it a good going over." ...|$|R

The aim of this thesis was to study the effects of a model of antenatal education, {{focusing}} on natural childbirth preparation by including psychoprophylaxis, breathing and relaxation techniques to cope with labour pain, and the actual use of psychoprophylaxis during labour. Satisfaction with antenatal education and experiences of a subgroup of men with antenatal fear of childbirth were also explored. The principal design was a randomised controlled trial where the new model, ―natural birth‖, was compared with standard antenatal education, ―standard care‖, as practised in Sweden at the commencement of the trial.

No sign of any castle could be seen (though we were evidently close up to the Medway) till we turned a corner, and there it was near at hand. Its walls and five visible towers were buried in ivy. Most of its moat had been filled in, but its {{reflection}} lay upon the calm face of the remaining fragment. ... The beauty of it all was entrancing.

40|$|Christians {{believe that}} the world had never {{experienced}} such an expression of personal care, forgiveness and love until the God of all creation intervened into the history to introduce Jesus Christ {{to act as a}} counselor, guardian, educator, and mentor. God, Himself, pressed through the clouds of doubt to offer Himself through His Son and then offered the Holy Spirit to be our daily guide, our teacher, one like the Father and Son. From the time we <b>take</b> <b>our</b> first <b>breath,</b> to the time we <b>take</b> <b>our</b> last <b>breath,</b> we are educated and guided by the Spirit of love, our personal gift from God. This becomes the bedrock of our spirituality. The Holy Spirit is the model or patron for all educators and parents.

60|$|In {{spite of}} all the splendours and the {{elaborated}} convenience, he washed himself in good hot water, and wished he were having a bath, chiefly because of the wardrobe of marvellous Turkish towels. Then he clicked his way back to his bedroom, changed his shirt and combed his hair in the blue silk bedroom with the Greuze picture, and felt a little dim and superficial surprise. He had fallen into country house parties before, but never into quite such a plushy sense of riches. He felt he ought to have his breath taken away. But alas, the cinema has <b>taken</b> <b>our</b> <b>breath</b> away so often, investing us in all the splendours of the splendidest American millionaire, or all the heroics and marvels of the Somme or the North Pole, that life has now no magnate richer than we, no hero nobler than we have been, on the film.

[...] Later on, Corbusier came once again to Niemeyer and asked him to reposition the Assembly Hall back to the center of the site. Such modification would destroy Niemeyer’s plans for a large civic square. However, he finally decided to accept the modification: [...] "I felt [...] would like to do his project, and he was the master. I do not regret my decision." [...] Together, they submitted the scheme 23–32, which was built and is what can be seen today.

Open the teahouse of experience. -From the Sufi tale, “The Story of Tea” 3 The only way in which to apprehend reality’s thickness is either to experience it directly by being a part of reality one’s self, or to evoke it in imagination by sympathetically divining some one else’s inner life.

The company had been prodigiously entertained by the tale, and clamoured for more, and when Horry had done I told how you had fought me at Annapolis, and had saved my life.

40|$|Sepietta sp. is a {{so-called}} bobtail squid {{that lives in}} the open water of the East Atlantic {{and can be found}} in the Mediterranean as well as in the cold waters of Scandinavia. The animal grows to about five centimeters in length and belongs to the group Cephalopoda which means “head foot ” animals. Cephalopods are found in all oceans on our planet, anywhere between the warm water of the tropics and the near freezing water at the poles. They can also reach down to the darkest parts of our oceans – the deep sea. Today there are around 800 species of cephalopods known, but many new species have very recently been discovered and there are still many that need to be described. This and many other marine organisms are studied at Kristineberg Marine Research Station on the West coast of Sweden. In order to advance the study of minute marine animals Kristineberg and Leica Microsystems have assembled an image centre with the purpose to acquire and analyze microscopic images of these organisms. The image centre currently runs with a number of stereo- and compound microscopes as well as a confocal laser scanning microscope. Many of the images produced here are not only of high scientific value; they are also very well suitable to communicate modern marine research to the public. Please see page 6 for further details.

60|$|On {{the brow}} of this precipice stood a great {{building}} of the same granite that formed the cliff, built on three sides of a square, the fourth side being open, save {{for a kind of}} battlement pierced at its base by a little door. This imposing place we afterwards discovered was the palace of the queen, or rather of the queens. At the back of the palace the town sloped gently upwards to a flashing building of white marble, crowned by the golden dome which we had already observed. The city was, with the exception of this one building, entirely built of red granite, and laid out in regular blocks with splendid roadways between. So far as we could see also the houses were all one-storied and detached, with gardens round them, which gave some relief to the eye wearied with the vista of red granite. At the back of the palace a road of extraordinary width stretched away up the hill for a distance of {{a mile and a half}} or so, and appeared to terminate at an open space surrounding the gleaming building that crowned the hill. But right in front of us was the wonder and glory of Milosis -- the great staircase of the palace, the magnificence of which <b>took</b> <b>our</b> <b>breath</b> away. Let the reader imagine, if he can, a splendid stairway, sixty-five feet from balustrade to balustrade, consisting of two vast flights, each of one hundred and twenty-five steps of eight inches in height by three feet broad, connected by a flat resting-place sixty feet in length, and running from the palace wall on the edge of the precipice down to meet a waterway or canal cut to its foot from the river. This marvellous staircase was supported upon a single enormous granite arch, of which the resting-place between the two flights formed the crown; that is, the connecting open space lay upon it. From this archway sprang a subsidiary flying arch, or rather something that resembled a flying arch in shape, such as none of us had seen in any other country, and of which the beauty and wonder surpassed all that we had ever imagined. Three hundred feet from point to point, and no less than five hundred and fifty round the curve, that half-arc soared touching the bridge it supported for a space of fifty feet only, one end resting on and built into the parent archway, and the other embedded in the solid granite of the side of the precipice.|$|R
2500|$|Three downtempo ballads follow, called [...] "the kind {{of songs}} you wouldn't {{want to listen}} to at all: the lyrics are boring at best and {{completely}} cliché at worst" [...] by one reviewer. The first, [...] "Don't Forsake Me" [...] is a torch song that was frequently compared to [...] "Too Hurt to Dance" [...] due to its lyrics about heartache. The song follows the retro sound Duffy had been previously known for and was called [...] "indebted to the pre-Beatles era". It was received negatively for [...] "paint too much of a resemblance" [...] to [...] "Warwick Avenue". The title song, which follows, is a love song that was again said to contain 1950s music references. The song features vinyl sounds and is sung to the accompaniment of an acoustic guitar. The final song in the trio of ballads is [...] "Breath Away", a 1960s-inspired ballad about love. Contactmusic.com [...] implied that the song is boring, saying that [...] " [...] hardly does anything to <b>take</b> <b>our</b> <b>breath</b> away", although it was said to [...] "showcase" [...] her vocal talents. Endlessly continues with two more up-tempo songs with a dance-orientated sound: [...] "Lovestruck" [...] and [...] "Girl", both called [...] "sassy" [...] and [...] "playful". The former is a disco song described as having [...] "the brashness of a Bond theme", with [...] "tragic undertones" [...] of a [...] "haunting creation". Lyrically, the song speaks of being so in love you are [...] "sleepless all night long", with the song opening [...] "It's a physical thing we got and I'm in paradise". The lyrical sentiment of [...] "My Boy" [...] is echoed in the latter, with the song being sung [...] "Girl, girl/Stay away, girl/Come back another day, girl/Better still don't come back ever stay away from here forever." [...] The album's final song, the string-led [...] "Hard for the Heart" [...] continues the soul pop sound of Rockferry and was described as a [...] "soulful pop confection" [...] by Uncut, whilst being labelled as the stand-out song on the album by many reviewers. The song's climax was compared to the song [...] "Hey Jude" [...] (1968) by The Beatles, whilst a reviewer for the BBC asserted that it [...] "unconsciously borrows from Coldplay's [...] "The Scientist"." [...] Entertainment Focus, on the other hand called it a [...] "lost Burt Bacharach classic", and Hammond's production skills were also praised on the song. It also received praise concerning Duffy's voice, something that was a feature of many critics' reviews, with Sputnik Music noting, [...] ""Hard for the Heart" [...] has the singer in an intensely emotional and surprisingly restrained moment. Her beautiful timbre finally gets to shine without choking out the sophisticated and apotheotic production, giving pulse and strength to a strikingly poetic composition." ...|$|R
