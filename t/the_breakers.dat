25|$|The maximum {{short-circuit}} current that a breaker can interrupt {{is determined by}} testing. Application of a breaker in a circuit with a prospective {{short-circuit current}} higher than <b>the</b> <b>breaker's</b> interrupting capacity rating may result in failure of <b>the</b> <b>breaker</b> to safely interrupt a fault. In a worst-case scenario <b>the</b> <b>breaker</b> may successfully interrupt the fault, only to explode when reset.|$|R
50|$|Zinsco {{electrical}} equipment is considered obsolete, {{due to a}} design flaw in which <b>the</b> circuit <b>breaker's</b> connection to <b>the</b> bus bar becomes loose, causing arcing and subsequent overheating. Long term exposure to this heat can cause <b>the</b> <b>breaker</b> to fuse to the bus bar, {{making it impossible to}} remove. Even worse, it can cause <b>the</b> <b>breaker's</b> contacts to fuse together, thus preventing <b>the</b> <b>breaker</b> from tripping even in an overcurrent situation, thereby causing a potential fire hazard.|$|R
5|$|Likewise, {{there was}} also severe wind damage in Palm Beach. A few {{buildings}} constructed by Henry Flagler, such as <b>The</b> <b>Breakers,</b> the Royal Poinciana Hotel, and Whitehall were damaged. At the Royal Poinciana, the hotel's botanical garden, which contained hundreds of exotic trees and plants, was almost completely destroyed. The golf club suffered severe roof damage, while the course was flooded with several inches to several feet of water. Waves inundated and swept away the foliage and trees {{at the house of}} J.

The Nassau and s were left in Germany. Following the scuttling of the German fleet in June 1919, all four ships were allotted to the victorious Allied powers as replacements for the scuttled ships. Nassau was ceded to Japan, Britain received Westfalen and Posen, and Rheinland was sold directly to <b>the</b> <b>breakers</b> at Dordrecht. Between 1920 and 1924, Westfalen was scrapped at Birkenhead and the remaining ships were scrapped at Dordrecht.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{surrender}} of the High Seas Fleet {{at the end of}} the war, Princess Royal and the 1st BCS made up part of the guard force in Scapa Flow. Princess Royal was reassigned to the Atlantic Fleet in April 1919. The battlecruiser was placed in reserve in 1920, and an attempt to sell her to Chile later that year was unsuccessful. She became the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief of the Scottish Coast on 22 February 1922. She was sold for scrap in December 1922 to meet the tonnage limitations set on the Royal Navy by the Washington Naval Treaty, and arrived at <b>the</b> <b>breakers</b> on 13 August 1923.|$|E

5|$|Harris made 11 {{appearances}} for the U-19 team in 2001, {{she started}} nine of those matches recording four shutouts. Of the 11 appearances, {{two of them}} were international matches. Harris started off 2001 with the U-19 team during a WUSA preseason exhibition match on March 25 against the Boston Breakers in Chula Vista, California. She allowed one goal during the match for a 1–0 victory for <b>the</b> <b>Breakers.</b> Harris then made appearances in two matches against the Canadian U-19 national team on June 30 and July 2. Harris joined the U-19 national team for an eight-day training camp in December 2001 at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in San Diego, California.|$|E
5|$|Hildebrand {{returned}} to the fleet after her modernization was completed, assigned to the II Squadron, alongside Heimdall, , and Beowulf. She remained in the fleet where she remained until the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, when she was mobilized into the VI Battle Squadron for coastal defense, along with her sister ships. On 31 August 1915, the VI Battle Squadron was demobilized, and Hildebrands crew was transferred to other warships. She was then used as a barracks ship in Windau. On 17 June 1919, she was stricken from the naval register. She was sold to the Netherlands for scrapping, but ran aground while en route to <b>the</b> <b>breakers.</b> In 1933, her wreck was blown up and subsequently broken up in situ.|$|E

50|$|Blue Coal's Huber Breaker was a {{landmark}} {{located in the}} borough of Ashley, Hanover Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, USA. <b>The</b> <b>breaker</b> was built in 1939 to replace <b>the</b> Maxwell <b>Breaker</b> which was located at the colliery. Run-of-mine coal arriving at <b>the</b> <b>breaker</b> was washed and cleaned to remove impurities, principally slate. It was crushed and screened to specific sizes desired by customers. Considered an ultra-modern plant when constructed, it used Menzies Cones to separate coal from waste. <b>The</b> <b>breaker</b> was operated by the Blue Coal Corporation, {{a subsidiary of the}} Glen Alden Coal Company. It processed 7,000 tons of Anthracite coal per day. The final product was sprayed with a blue dye and sold as “Blue Coal.” Railcars were loaded underneath <b>the</b> <b>breaker</b> and shipped to markets. The long decline of the anthracite industry after World War II caused Blue Coal to declare bankruptcy and cease operations in 1976.|$|R

5|$|Stricken {{from the}} naval {{register}} on 2 August 1947, the ship remained as a training vessel until August 1951, {{when she was}} sold to the Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain. After preparing from 5 to 18 September, São Paulo was given an eight-man caretaker crew and taken under tow by two tugs, Dexterous and Bustler, in Rio de Janeiro on 20 September 1951 for one last voyage to Greenock and <b>the</b> <b>breakers.</b> When north of the Azores in early November, the two lines snapped during a strong storm. American B-17 Flying Fortress bombers and British planes were launched to scour the Atlantic for the missing ship. The ship was reported as found on the 15th, but this proved to be false. The search was ended on 10 December without finding São Paulo or her crew.|$|E

5|$|The three {{survivors}} escorted troop convoys from French North Africa to France {{for several}} months after the beginning of World War I in August 1914. Unlike her sisters, Bruix {{was transferred to the}} Atlantic to support Allied operations against the German colony of Kamerun in September 1914 while Amiral Charner and Latouche-Tréville were assigned to the Eastern Mediterranean. where they blockaded the Ottoman-controlled coast, and supported Allied operations. Amiral Charner was sunk in early 1916 by a German submarine. Latouche-Tréville became a training ship in late 1917 and was decommissioned in 1919. Bruix was decommissioned in Greece at the beginning of 1918 and recommissioned {{after the end of the}} war in November for service in the Black Sea against the Bolsheviks. She returned home in 1919 and was sold for scrap in 1921. Latouche-Tréville followed her to <b>the</b> <b>breakers</b> five years later.|$|E

They attempt {{to go to the}} airport but are trapped by the hurricane. Elsewhere at <b>the</b> <b>Breakers</b> Condominiums, Deputy Greer encounters the creature after finding a dead man covered in a slimy substance on a toilet. Mulder and Scully later find the deputy's vehicle parked outside the apartments. Searching the building, they discover Greer on the ground, his neck covered with red welts. Mulder goes around the complex to find {{the rest of the people}} and warn them that the thing is in the plumbing. He encounters Dougie, a looter, Walter Suarez whose girlfriend Angela Villareal is nine months pregnant, and George Vincent, an anti-government Second Amendment activist. Mulder attempts to get Vincent to come out and join them for his own protection. Vincent refuses but, after being attacked by the creature in his apartment, relents. Mulder hypothesizes that the entity attacking them was driven from the bottom of the sea by the hurricane into the city's water system.|$|E
