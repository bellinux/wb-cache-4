40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} a tensor transform for Boolean functions {{that covers the}} algebraic normal and Walsh transforms but which also allows for the definition of new, probabilistic and weight transforms, relating a function to its bias polynomial and to the weights of its subfunctions respectively. Our approach leads to easy proofs for some known results and to new properties of the aforecited transforms. Several new results about algebraic and correlation properties that depend on the weight transform of Boolean functions are proved. Finally, we present a new probabilistic characteristic of a Boolean function that is defined by its algebraic normal and probabilistic transforms over <b>the</b> <b>reals.</b> <b>Key</b> words: cryptography, key-stream generator, Boolean function, tensor transform, Walsh transform, correlation, probabilistic properties...|$|R
50|$|Among the 20 franc pieces, the 1926 coin {{with its}} mintage of only 50,000 pieces is the {{ostensible}} key to that series. However, the 1926 is relatively fairly common and <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>keys</b> to <b>the</b> series {{are said to}} be the 1903 and the 1904. This is based upon the fact that the major coin grading services have graded less than 10 coins of each date in all grades, while the 1926 has a graded population of over 200. Of course, populations depend upon the numbers of coins actually submitted by collectors which is inexorable tied to the popularity of a coin series, or lack thereof among collectors. For a critique of population reports see Doug Winter's essay, February 2002.|$|R
