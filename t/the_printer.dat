5|$|After {{voting in}} favor of the {{resolution}} of independence, Congress turned its attention to the committee's draft of the declaration. Over several days of debate, they made a few changes in wording and deleted nearly a fourth of the text and, on July 4, 1776, the wording of the Declaration of Independence was approved and sent to <b>the</b> <b>printer</b> for publication.|$|E

50|$|During {{this period}} <b>the</b> <b>printers</b> were still working under very {{difficult}} conditions. Like <b>the</b> <b>printers</b> before them, many of <b>the</b> <b>printers</b> and publishers were still plagued by debt {{and had to}} work tirelessly to earn enough to support their political careers and keep the newspapers running. These men continued the difficult work of liberating the Canadian press {{and it is in}} the stories of these men that we start to see some success along with the difficulty.|$|R
5|$|In 1892 Lasker {{founded the}} first of his chess magazines, The London Chess Fortnightly, which was {{published}} from August 15, 1892 to July 30, 1893. In the second quarter of 1893 there was a gap of ten weeks between issues, allegedly because of problems with <b>the</b> <b>printer.</b> Shortly after its last issue Lasker traveled to the US, where he spent the next two years.|$|E

5|$|Wyn died in 1967, and {{the company}} grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably.

5|$|Barley himself {{published}} {{four books}} under his patent. In March 1612, one of Barley's servants died, possibly from plague. After receiving charitable remuneration from the Stationers' Company, Barley moved, {{first to the}} parish of St Katherine Cree, and later to a house on Bishopsgate. Records from St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate indicate his burial on 11 July 1614. His widow, Mary, and their son, William, were legatees of the will of Pavier. Mary Barley, who later remarried, transferred five of her husband's patents to printer John Beale. Some of Barley's remaining copyrights may have also been passed to <b>the</b> <b>printer</b> Thomas Snodham.|$|E
5|$|Day's {{origins and}} the events of his early life remain obscure. Scholars have assumed that Day {{was born and raised}} in Dunwich, but there is no direct {{evidence}} that proves this claim. He may have been in London by 1540, as his name is mentioned in a city deposition as being a former servant of <b>the</b> <b>printer</b> and physician Thomas Raynalde. In 1546, he was probably one of twenty men who were granted the freedom of the city by redemption to work for the Stringers' Company of London.|$|E
5|$|Eddy copyrighted her book, {{then called}} The Science of Life, in July 1874. Three of her students, George Barry, Elizabeth Newhall and Daniel Spofford, paid a Boston printer, W. F. Brown and Company, $2,200 {{to produce the}} first edition. <b>The</b> <b>printer</b> began work in September 1874, but stopped {{whenever}} the advance payment ran out, so progress was slow. The book—Science and Health by Mary Baker Glover, with eight chapters and 456 pages—finally appeared on October 30, 1875, published {{in the name of}} the Christian Science Publishing Company.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> ZX <b>Printer</b> used special 4 in wide {{black paper}} which was {{supplied}} {{coated with a}} thin layer of aluminium. To mark the paper, one of <b>the</b> <b>printer's</b> two styluses passed a current through a small area of the aluminium layer, causing the aluminium to evaporate and reveal the black under-surface. <b>The</b> <b>printer's</b> horizontal resolution was the same as the ZX81's video display, i.e. 256 dots (pixels) or 32 characters (using the standard character definition).|$|R

5|$|Jonathan Swift, then Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, {{was already}} {{known for his}} concern for the Irish people and for writing several {{political}} pamphlets. One of these, Proposal for the Universal use of Irish Manufacture (1720), had so inflamed the British authorities that <b>the</b> <b>printer,</b> John Harding, was prosecuted, although the pamphlet had done little more than recommend that the Irish use the materials they produce rather than export them to England. It was also known by the Irish authorities that Swift's political pamphleteering had been employed by the Tory government of Queen Anne, {{and that he would}} use his abilities to undermine the Whig government of Walpole.|$|E
5|$|Miss Malini marked Narayan's {{earliest}} use {{of story}} elements that would recur {{in some of}} his later novels. It was later rewritten by him as the 1949 novel Mr. Sampath– <b>The</b> <b>Printer</b> of Malgudi, which in turn was adapted into the Hindi film Mr. Sampat (1952) directed by S. S. Vasan, and a 1972 Tamil film directed by Cho Ramaswamy. Although no print of Miss Malini is known to survive, which makes it a lost film, surviving artefacts include its songs, along with a few stills and newspaper advertisements.|$|E
5|$|Morison was {{interested}} {{in the history of the}} 15th century Italian printing, and had discussed the topic with his correspondent, <b>the</b> <b>printer</b> Giovanni Mardersteig, in correspondence with whom he wrote a series of letters discussing Bembo's development. He also discussed the project in his letters with the Poet Laureate Robert Bridges, who had some interest in printing. For the project Morison bought a copy of De Aetna which he then sold to Monotype as a model.|$|E

5|$|Poliphilus {{is named}} after the book Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, one of Manutius's most famous books in the Latin alphabet, which was printed with the same roman as De Aetna but recut capitals; it was made for the Medici Society, who planned to create an English translation. Blado {{is named after}} <b>the</b> <b>printer</b> Antonio Blado, a {{colleague}} of Arrighi. Morison preferred Bembo's roman and was somewhat dismissive of Poliphilus. Unlike Bembo, both in metal featured a Greek-influenced Y with a curving head, as in the original.|$|E
5|$|Special {{consideration}} {{was given}} during filming {{to allow for}} integration of the planned special effects. Television monitors standing in for computer displays were specially calibrated so that their refresh rate {{did not result in}} banding on film. Due to a loss of resolution and quality resulting from rephotographing an element in an optical printer, live action sequences for effects were shot in 65mm or VistaVision formats to compensate. When the larger prints were reduced through an anamorphic lens on <b>the</b> <b>printer,</b> the result was a Panavision composite.|$|E

The revolutionaries countered this move with a similar one, so that most people would be against Cisneros instead. <b>The</b> <b>printer</b> Agustín Donado, supporting the revolutionaries, printed nearly 600invitations instead of the 450requested, and distributed the surplus among the criollos.

5|$|While imprisoned and {{awaiting}} execution, Beauchamp wrote a confession. He accused Patrick Darby {{of perjury}} {{with regard to}} the alleged 1824 meeting between them. Many believed Beauchamp's accusation was meant to curry favor with New Court governor Joseph Desha – who considered Darby a political enemy – and to secure a pardon from him. When Beauchamp finished the confession in mid-June 1826, his uncle, Senator Beauchamp, took it to the state printer for immediate publication. An Old Court supporter, <b>the</b> <b>printer</b> refused to publish it.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of World War II, both Parker Brothers and Waddington stockpiled {{materials}} they could use for further game production. During the war, Monopoly was produced with wooden tokens in the U.S., and the game's cellophane cover was eliminated. In the UK, metal tokens were also eliminated, and a special spinner was introduced {{to take the place}} of dice. The game remained in print for a time even in the Netherlands, as <b>the</b> <b>printer</b> there was able to maintain a supply of paper. Elizabeth Magie's second patent on The Landlord's Game expired in September, 1941, and it is believed that after the expiration, she was no longer promoted as an inventor of Monopoly. The game itself remained popular during the war, particularly in camps, and soldiers playing the game became part of the product's advertising in 1944.|$|E
