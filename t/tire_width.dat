50|$|In 1983 Honda {{was facing}} a {{challenge}} in the marketplace from a new full-dress tourer, the Yamaha Venture XVZ 1200 with its DOHC four valve per cylinder V4 engine (as Yamaha's XS Eleven Venturer had challenged the GL1100 two years earlier). Honda hit back at the Milan motorcycle show late that year by announcing a new 1984 Gold Wing that pushed its four-cylinder engine design to its limits. The bored and stroked boxer produced more power and torque; a new final drive ratio gave the GL1200 taller gearing {{in order to reduce}} noise and vibration. The four Keihin 32 mm CV carburetors were larger than those on the GL1100 engine, on the other hand, they were {{the same size as the}} '75-'76 GL1000 carbs. Incorporating hydraulic actuation for the clutch, in addition to hydraulic tappets for the valves, made the new engine virtually maintenance-free. In order to make the Gold Wing more nimble, front and rear wheel diameters contracted (and <b>tire</b> <b>widths</b> expanded) one more time. The GL1200 was built on a new, stronger frame and despite all the improvements, the claimed dry weight of the naked bike remained unchanged at 599 lb, and it was priced at $4,800 for the 1984 model year.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Streetcar or {{train tracks}} {{in urban areas}} are {{difficult}} for bicyclists to negotiate and are a cause of crashes and injuries. This study used mixed methods to identify measures to prevent such crashes, by examining track-related crashes that resulted in injuries to cyclists, and obtaining information from the local transit agency and bike shops. Methods We compared personal, trip, and route infrastructure characteristics of 87 crashes directly involving streetcar or train tracks to 189 crashes in other circumstances in Toronto, Canada. We complemented this with engineering information about the rail systems, interviews of personnel at seven bike shops about advice they provide to customers, and <b>width</b> measurements of <b>tires</b> on commonly sold bikes. Results In our study, 32  % of injured cyclists had crashes that directly involved tracks. The vast majority resulted from the bike tire being caught in the rail flangeway (gap in the road surface alongside rails), often when cyclists made unplanned maneuvers to avoid a collision. Track crashes were more common on major city streets with parked cars and no bike infrastructure, with left turns at intersections, with hybrid, racing and city bikes, among less experienced and less frequent bicyclists, and among women. Commonly sold bikes typically had <b>tire</b> <b>widths</b> narrower than the smallest track flangeways. There were no track crashes in route sections where streetcars and trains had dedicated rights of way. Conclusions Given our results, prevention efforts might be directed at individual knowledge, bicycle tires, or route design, but their potential for success is likely to differ. Although {{it may be possible}} to reach a broader audience with continued advice about how to avoid track crashes, the persistence and frequency of these crashes and their unpredictable circumstances indicates that other solutions are needed. Using tires wider than streetcar or train flangeways could prevent some crashes, though there are other considerations that lead many cyclists to have narrower tires. To prevent the majority of track-involved injuries, route design measures including dedicated rail rights of way, cycle tracks (physically separated bike lanes), and protected intersections would be the best strategy...|$|R
40|$|Car {{tires are}} {{supposed}} to be constructed for safe, economical, pleasant and environmentally friendly driving. Three performance measures that would quite well represent the major operational characteristics of tires within the mentioned topics would be noise emission, wet friction and rolling resitance. Since the latter affects fuel consumption it also affects economy and exhaust emissions. It is sometimes claimed that when trying to reduce exterior noise emission, there is a conflict with friction and perhaps also with rolling resistance. The implication would be that one could not reduce tire/road noise any further without sacrificing safety or economy. A European Union directive with noise emission limits for tires is underway. It has been suggested that tires should meet certain limits also with regard to friction; assuming a conflict between requirements for low noise and high friction. Consequently, it is important to study this matter further. Earlier studies have indicated that there is no consistent conflict between friction and noise characteristics with respect to road surfaces. For 12 tires tested on 5 surfaces Denker found no significant noise-friction correlation, until he normalized friction values in an unusual way, in which case he found weak conflicts between noise and friction. Tests in 1992 by Nelson for 16 car and 9 truck tires indicated weak noise-safety correlations, suggesting a conflict between the parameters, but this could well have been biased by the inclusion {{of a wide range of}} <b>tire</b> <b>widths.</b> According to Ejsmont, a general conflict between noise and rolling resistance properties could not be found. A recent and quite comprehensive study in Germany, made on 48 car tires, concluded that neither was there any correlation between noise and rolling resistance, nor between noise and "wet braking". The same was found between noise and aquaplaning speed. These authors conducted a pilot study in 1997 with the purpose to establish relations between exterior tire/road noise, wet friction and rolling resistance of current car tires. The first conclusions suggested that there is no significant conflict between friction and noise or between rolling resistance and noise. This study was limited to 28 tires so it was decided to continue with testing in order to get higher confidence of the results and to examine altogether about 100 modern car tires of similar size. The results of this study, which is believed to be the most comprehensive study of these relations so far, are presented here...|$|R

The sediment disturbance that {{is caused by}} ORVs {{is believed to have}} a large impact on erosion (by wind or waves), which there by affects the morphology of the foredunes. With greater knowledge of ORV impacts, the NPS can better manage ORV use and minimize anthropogenic affects to the coastal environment. There remains considerable uncertainty about the disturbance and its larger-scale impact. This study quantifies the sediment disturbance made by tire tracks, as well as the <b>tire</b> track form, <b>width,</b> depth, and evolution with relation to the number of vehicle passes and location on the beach at Assateague Island National Seashore (ASIS), Maryland. To measure ORV impact, ground-based LiDAR was used to collect detailed profiles across a three by three meter test plot at each site. Based on the quantification of the displaced sediment and redistribution of that sediment from the tracks, a recommendation to the NPS can be made as to where along the beach traffic should be limited to, in order to minimize impact to the physical environment at ASIS. Tire tracks were found to widen after the first pass, {{as a result of the}} imperfections of driving. Compaction of the sediment in the center of the tire track accounts for only a minimal amount of the sediment lost from the tire tracks. Sediment removal accounted for greater than 75 % of the sediment lost from the tire tracks at all sites. It was concluded that sediment removal is the most dominant factor in the creation and evolution of a <b>tire</b> track. The <b>width,</b> depth, and evolution of a tire track were also found to be controlled by the imperfections of driving. Despite the amount of sediment disturbance, it is found that there is no net downslope displacement of sediment. This conclusion counters previous ORV impact studies and suggests that ORVs are not directly responsible for beach erosion. It is also recommended that to minimize the impact of OVRs on the beach at ASIS, the NPS should limit driving to the backshore...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Rolling {{resistance}} {{is one of}} the most substantial energy losses when the wheel moves on soft soil. Rolling resistance value optimization will help to improve energy efficiency. Accurate modeling of the interaction soil-tire is an important key to this optimization and has eliminated the need for costly field tests and has reduced the time required to test. Rolling resistance will change because of the tire and wheel motion parameters and characteristics of the ground surface. Some tire design parameters are more important such as the <b>tire</b> diameter, <b>width,</b> <b>tire</b> aspect ratio, lugs form, inflation pressure and mechanical properties of tire structure. On the other hand, the soil or ground surface characteristics include soil type; moisture content and bulk density have an important role in this phenomenon. In addition, the vertical load and the wheel motion parameters such as velocity and tire slip are the other factors which impact on tire rolling resistance. According to same studies about the rolling resistance of the wheel, the wheel is significantly affected by the dynamic load. Tire inflation pressure impacted on rolling resistance of tires that were moving on hard surfaces. Studies showed that the rolling resistance of tires with low inflation pressure (less than 100 kPa) was too high. According to Zoz and Griss researches, increasing the tire pressure increases rolling resistance on soft soil but reduces the rolling resistance of on-road tires and tire-hard surface interaction. Based on these reports, the effect of velocity on tire rolling resistance for tractors and vehicles with low velocity (less than 5 meters per second) is usually insignificant. According to Self and Summers studies, rolling resistance of the wheel is dramatically affected by dynamic load on the wheel. Artificial Neural Network {{is one of the}} best computational methods capable of complex regression estimation which is an advantage of this method compared with the analytical and statistical methods. It is expected that the neural network can more accurately predict the rolling resistance. In this study, the neural network for experimental data was trained and the relationship among some parameters of velocity, dynamic load and tire pressure and rolling resistance were evaluated. Materials and Methods: The soil bin and single wheel tester of Biosystem Engineering Mechanics Department of Urmia University was used in this study. This soil bin has 24 m length, 2 m width and 1 m depth including a single-wheel tester and the carrier. Tester consists of four horizontal arms and a vertical arm to vertical load.
