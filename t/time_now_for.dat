6000|$|... "You can {{go if you}} choose, but {{you will}} learn nothing. I told Mr Slow that I would bid you wait till I heard from him again. It is <b>time</b> <b>now</b> <b>for</b> us {{to get ready for}} dinner." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Never {{mind about}} the others. I hold a winning hand, but what that is I'll let <b>time</b> show. <b>Now,</b> <b>for</b> the last <b>time,</b> {{are you willing to}} let me take charge or not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will think}} it over, Master Jim. It {{is a long}} <b>time</b> ago <b>now,</b> <b>for</b> I was not above six-and-twenty when it happened. But I will think it over, and see if I can call back {{something}} worth telling." ...|$|R
60|$|We have no <b>time</b> <b>now</b> <b>for</b> these, {{we must go}} on to the humblest {{group of}} all, yet the most wonderful, that of the grass which has given us our bread; and from that we will go back to the herbs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go along home," [...] {{said a voice}} inside him, [...] "there {{is hardly}} <b>time</b> <b>now</b> <b>for</b> you to get there before the Black Shadows arrive. Don't waste any more time here. What may happen to those silly Ducks is no {{business}} of yours, {{and there is nothing}} you can do, anyway. Go along home." ...|$|E
60|$|Cornelius and his friends, however, {{gave him}} no <b>time</b> <b>now</b> <b>for</b> further reflection. All the {{thinking}} out {{would have to}} be done presently--no doubt on the way between Haarlem and Houdekerk, and probably in a mist of driving snow--for the nonce he had to stand under the fire of unstinted eulogy hurled at him from every side.|$|E
50|$|In between {{there are}} scores of novelettes, plays, essays, poems, reviews and many short stories. Many {{of his works}} have been {{translated}} to English and other languages.

60|$|The <b>time</b> <b>now</b> {{approached}} <b>for</b> Lady Russell's return: the day {{was even}} fixed; and Anne, being engaged to join her {{as soon as she}} was resettled, was looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch, and beginning to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it.|$|R
60|$|The <b>time</b> had <b>now</b> come <b>for</b> {{speaking}} plainly. Father Benwell {{no longer}} advanced to his end {{under cover of}} a cloud of words.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you;--thank you; {{that will}} do, my dear. Shut it up," [...] said the sick woman. [...] "It's <b>time</b> <b>now</b> <b>for</b> the draught." [...] Then Dorothy moved quietly about the room, and did her nurse's work with soft hand, and soft touch, and soft tread. After that her aunt kissed her, and bade her {{sit down and}} sleep.|$|E
6000|$|I was dumbfounded. In what manner had the Chief Commissary of Police been already apprised of this affair? The {{whole thing}} was, of course, a swift and vengeful blow dealt {{to me by}} that cowardly Rochez. But how, {{in the name of}} thunder, had he got to work so quickly? But, of course, there was no <b>time</b> <b>now</b> <b>for</b> reflection. The gruff voice was going on more peremptorily and more insistently: ...|$|E
6000|$|James had {{accumulated}} sixpences, {{and made a}} little space in his shop. He had desisted from [...] "creations." [...] <b>Time</b> <b>now</b> <b>for</b> a new flight. He decided {{it was better to}} be a manufacturer than a tradesman. His shop, already only half its original size, was again too big. It might be split once more. Rents had risen in Woodhouse. Why not cut off another shop from his premises? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, {{tomorrow}} morning, we {{will start}} in earnest. We shall have plenty of opportunities to talk over our plans, so let us lose no <b>time,</b> <b>now,</b> in looking <b>for</b> a bed." ...|$|R

6000|$|He turn'd his lip to hers, {{and with}} his hand [...] Call'd back the tangles of her {{wandering}} hair; [...] Even then their love they could not all command, [...] And half forgot their danger and despair: [...] Antonia's patience now was at a stand-- [...] 'Come, come, 't is no <b>time</b> <b>now</b> <b>for</b> fooling there,' [...] She whisper'd, in great wrath--'I must deposit [...] This pretty gentleman within the closet: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon, my lord--but {{there is not}} <b>time,</b> <b>now,</b> <b>for</b> me to reach the ship before the sun set. I have a signal {{prepared}} in the boat, it is true; but the frigate may not come round Campanella before the last moment, and then all these pains will be lost. Does not Captain Cuffe speak of some guns to be fired from the flag-ship, my lord?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Dolly {{herself was}} {{disposed}} {{to be silent}} for some <b>time</b> <b>now,</b> <b>for</b> she had spoken {{from the depths of}} her own simple belief, and was much concerned to know whether her words would produce the desired effect on Silas. He was puzzled and anxious, for Dolly's word [...] "christened" [...] conveyed no distinct meaning to him. He had only heard of baptism, and had only seen the baptism of grown-up men and women.|$|E
60|$|If {{the poor}} girl's {{life had been}} miserable before, it was ten <b>times</b> worse <b>now,</b> <b>for</b> the moment her father's back was turned the others teased and tormented her from morning till night; and their fury was {{increased}} {{by the sight of}} her wreath, which the doves had placed again on her head.|$|R
5000|$|Arthur Christopher Benson. An {{academic}} at Oxford University, {{author of}} popular books in his <b>time,</b> and <b>now</b> remembered <b>for</b> his lyrics to Elgar's [...] "Land of Hope and Glory".|$|R
5000|$|June 20 - Following {{a warning}} {{from the state}} Department of Environmental Quality {{threatening}} Flint with legal action if a water contract is not approved by June 26, Weaver called {{a press conference in}} her office where she said the <b>time</b> is <b>now</b> <b>for</b> the council to approve a 30-year contract with the Great Lakes Water Authority.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{will be here}} directly, miss," [...] Groves remarked, as he {{completed}} the finishing touches {{which he had been}} putting to the table, and stepped back a little to view the effect. So {{far as he was concerned}} they might come any <b>time</b> <b>now.</b> <b>For</b> once his subordinates had not failed him. Nothing had been forgotten; and, on the whole, he felt that he had reason to be proud of his handiwork.|$|E
60|$|By-and-by, the scurvy came (I have no <b>time</b> <b>now</b> <b>for</b> details, {{my hands}} are so cramped with cold), and then we began to run short of provisions. Soon I had them all down upon my hands, and {{presently}} we had to place Paterson's corpse beside Lemarchant's on the little headland. Then they sank, one after another--sank of cold and hunger, as you will read in the log--till I alone, who wanted least to live, was the last left living.|$|E
60|$|There was no <b>time</b> <b>now</b> <b>for</b> {{explanations}} or for any {{story to}} be told, and Burke gave orders that the yacht {{should be kept}} away from the sinking steamer and her boats. Suddenly Burdette, from the pilot house, sung {{out that there was}} a steamer astern, and the eyes which had been so steadfastly fixed upon the Dunkery Beacon now turned in that direction. There they saw, less than a mile away, a large steamer coming down from the north.|$|E
5000|$|Fashion {{designer}} Giorgio Armani {{has given}} {{support to the}} effort to eliminate ultra-thin models. [...] "The <b>time</b> has <b>now</b> come <b>for</b> clarity. We all {{need to work together}} against anorexia." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had no <b>time</b> <b>now</b> to waste, <b>for</b> I {{knew that}} your brother would give {{information}} {{that might be}} bad for me, so I asked the nurse to write down, while I repeated it, the lawyer's address.|$|R
5000|$|Ford {{was also}} one of the leading scorers in the game. She set the NCAA single-season scoring record with 919 points in 1986 (<b>now</b> eighth all <b>time).</b> [...] Her average of 30.6 points per game in 1986 was the second highest at that <b>time</b> (<b>now</b> fifth all <b>time).</b> [...] She also scored 54 points in a February 22, 1986 game against Missouri State, which was the second highest single-game scoring total up to that <b>time</b> (<b>now</b> tied <b>for</b> seventh all time).|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} have seen how poor, how very poor they were. His wife is such a nice, quiet, hardworking woman, and has two such pretty children. I went to see them and carry them Christmas things yesterday, but it's no good doing {{anything}} if John can't get work. She told me how the poor fellow had been walking {{the streets in the}} cold, day after day, trying everywhere, and nobody would take him. It's a dreadful <b>time</b> <b>now</b> <b>for</b> a man to be out of work, and it isn't fair his poor wife and children should suffer. Do try him again, papa!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Papa is busy, but Miss Bat {{ought to}} see to us; she is paid for it, and {{goodness}} knows she has an easy <b>time</b> <b>now,</b> <b>for</b> if I ask her to do anything, she groans over her bones, and tells me young folks should wait on themselves. I take all the care of Boo off her hands, but I can't wash my own things, and he hasn't a decent trouser to his blessed little legs. I'd tell papa, but it wouldn't do any good; he'd only say, 'Yes, child, yes, I'll attend to it,' and never do a thing." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{lost some}} <b>time,</b> <b>now,</b> <b>for</b> these big children, their fears gone, became so ravished with wonder over my awe-compelling {{fireworks}} that I {{had to stay}} there and smoke a couple of pipes out before they would let me go. Still the delay was not wholly unproductive, for it took all that time to get Sandy thoroughly wonted to the new thing, she being so close to it, you know. It plugged up her conversation mill, too, for a considerable while, {{and that was a}} gain. But above all other benefits accruing, I had learned something. I was ready for any giant or any ogre that might come along, now.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor old fellow!" [...] said I, [...] "the only comfort I {{can offer}} him is what I take myself,--that this sad world will last out our <b>time</b> at least. <b>Now</b> <b>for</b> the next." ...|$|R
60|$|Shortly {{afterward}} Mr. Hardy {{suggested that}} the <b>time</b> had <b>now</b> come <b>for</b> improving the house, and laid before his assembled family his plans for so doing, which were received with great applause.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004 another {{symbol of}} now {{vanished}} Jewish district appeared in Lublin. An original street lantern on Podwale St. that has remained there since the prewar <b>times</b> (<b>now</b> adapted <b>for</b> electricity) embodies Jewish {{presence in the}} area. It was lit as a commemoration token during the second mystery of memory [...] "Poem of the Place" [...] and has been on ever since, night and day.|$|R
