40|$|Sudden {{breakage}} of a tap {{is frequently}} encountered during tapping small diameter internal threads on titanium alloys. This work therefore presents an extensive experimentation to investigate mechanism {{and performance of}} tapping in titanium alloys {{in the presence of}} axial and, axial and torsional vibration assisted tapping (AVAT and ATVAT). Tapping cycles based on the variation in thrust and torque in tapping have been established, which illustrate subtle differences in the tapping phenomena as a consequence of vibrations. AVAT and ATVAT were found to reduce tapping torque, axial force and temperature over that of the conventional tapping (CT) without compromising the thread quality. Between ATVAT and AVAT, ATVAT gives improved performance. The ATVAT and AVAT processes generate elastic recovery-free superior surfaces as against the heavily recovered surfaces in CT. Microstructure of the tapped surfaces shows a reduction in <b>tapping</b> affected <b>zone</b> in ATVAT and AVAT than that of in CT. (C) 2016 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

50|$|The goal of {{the game}} is to clear each stage without the enemy {{reaching}} the player's safe <b>zone.</b> <b>Tapping</b> one unit into the enemy allows it to attack and if the stage is cleared, the player can move to the next stage until it reaches the boss. If the one of the enemies reaches the safe zone, the game is over. However, each unit has its own skill that can counter against enemies and easily clear each stage. If all stages are cleared, the player is awarded with money, special arcana and Arcana Coins. Players can also summon allies by using either Prysma or Arcana Coins, which are earned during gameplay. Each unit has its own story, which can be completed to obtain more Prysma or to unlock its special skill. Events are also in the game, allowing players to get special items and Arcanas.|$|R
40|$|Intact {{and root}} tip-decapitated {{seedlings}} of Pinus pinea {{were treated with}} [8 - 14 C]zeatin. In intact plants, most of the applied radioactivity remained in the roots. Root tip removal resulted in greater transport of radioactivity to the shoot. The relative distribution of radioactivity along the tap root was non-linear. High amounts of radioactivity associated with zeatin-like compounds were recovered in the elongation <b>zone</b> of intact <b>tap</b> roots. HPLC separation of extracts from the different sections from intact roots showed that the applied zeatin was rapidly metabolized. Very little radioactivity was detected in the upper sections of the root where lateral root formation and lateral root elongation occurred. This radioactivity {{was not associated with}} the retention times of authentic cytokinin standards. In the <b>tap</b> root elongation <b>zone,</b> peaks of radioactivity which co-chromatographed with authentic zeatin and iso-pentenyladenine were detected. The uneven distribution of applied cytokinins in the tap root, and particularly the higher levels recovered from the root elongation zone, could explain why lateral roots do not develop in this region...|$|R
40|$|Intelligent {{development}} of groundwater resources {{is a process}} that requires a thorough understanding of the availability and movement of groundwater. In northern Arkansas knowledge of the deep aquifers is fairly limited, perhaps because economic factors and uncertain yields have discouraged exploitation. The {{development of}} these deeper aquifers to their fullest potential as reliable water sources depends on the delineation of high yield areas, a process that may be facilitated by linear trend analysis as outlined in this study. Satellite and photolineament maps of the 13 counties were prepared by use of LANDSAT images and Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service photo indexes. The lineaments and fracture traces on aerial photographs and LANDSAT images are natural linear features such as aligned stream segments, soil tonal and vegetal alignments, and topographic sags. These features are the surface manifestation of subsurface fracture zones of undermined origin, which are areas where increased solutioning of carbonate rocks has taken place. The results of statistical testing of well yields in the study area show that the fracture trace-lineament method of well location can result in improved well yields. The fact that higher yields are obtained from wells on lineaments shows that these linear features are indeed surface manifestations of increased solutioning in the subsurface. These zones of fracture, enlarged by groundwater circulation, are capable of transmitting a greater volume of water at a faster rate than rocks between lineaments. Wells <b>tapping</b> these <b>zones</b> consequently show higher yields than those drilled randomly. In northern Arkansas where shallow groundwater supplies soon may not meet the demands of a growing population, linear trends interpreted from LANDSAT can be useful in the search for more reliable groundwater sources. Their use will help the development of the deep aquifers of the area as reliable sources for domestic, municipal and industrial water supplies...|$|R
30|$|Ground water {{occurs in}} almost all {{geological}} formations, and its potential depends upon the nature of geological formations, geographical set up, incidence of rainfall, recharge, and other hydrogeological characters of the aquifer. Among the consolidated formations, gneisses are relatively good aquifers. Schistose formations also form potential aquifers when the wells <b>tapping</b> the contact <b>zones</b> with intrusives. Quartzites and shales of Cuddapah group are of little significance from the ground water point of view as they are restricted to the hilly terrain in the western margin of the district. In the consolidated formations, ground water occurs under unconfined to semiconfined conditions. Ground water is developed in these formations by dug wells, dug cum bore wells, and bore wells tapping weathered and fractured zones. The yield of the dug wells is {{in the range of}} 15 – 35 m 3 /day and reduces considerably during peak summer periods. The occurrence of fractures in these formations is limited to 40 – 60  m bgl and occasionally extends down to 70 – 80  m bgl. The bore wells in these formations generally tap the weathered and fractured zones.|$|R
30|$|Under World Bank {{assisted}} Hydrology Project (Phase-I) purpose-built piezometers were drilled by the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) in {{hard rock}} terrain of the Peninsular India to depths of 30, 60, and 90  m. The depth range selected was to <b>tap</b> weathered <b>zone</b> or shallow fracture/fracture zone down to 30  m, between 30 and 60  m {{and in the}} range of 60 – 90  m depth separately. Groundwater level data and well information were collected. Many of these wells were fitted with a pressure transducer type high frequency digital automatic water level recorder (DWLR) scheduled to record six hourly data to obtain a continuous groundwater level spectrum. Further, these DWLRs also had the capability to automatically record any extreme event (anomalous rise or fall) that may occur intermittently in groundwater levels outside of defined interval. The data so obtained from each piezometer was downloaded onto a computer. Dedicated software “GEMS” (“Groundwater Estimation and Management software” developed by CGWB) was used to store and retrieve these data along with its well information and to generate a hydrograph for a requisite period from all over the country. This was to ensure measurement of the undistorted piezometric head at the desired frequency, which was larger than the traditional frequency. In fact, the frequency is so high that the resulting piezometric hydrograph may almost be continuous. The GEMS can also incorporate corresponding daily rainfall of the piezometer site. More than 250 representative true hydrographs so obtained in uniform format, having time series data of more than one annual cycle, were compared and analyzed. Selected hydrograph were from hard rock area of eight Indian States namely Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Tamilnadu (Fig.  1). Based on identified marked similarities in the crest and trough shape of true hydrographs and by comparison of apparent line thickness of curves representing different litho-type which were spatially distributed over about 1.7  million km 2 area, the hard rock aquifers of the Peninsular India have been classified into genetic groups.|$|R
40|$|Carbon Dioxide (CO 2) {{laser beam}} cutting (LBC) process {{involves}} several parameters. These parameters {{need to be}} optimized {{in order to get}} the best quality output. Researchers had applied various types of optimization methods which are used for single or multi-objectives problems. One of the methods is Grey-Taguchi method. However, there is a disadvantage of these methods. This study focuses on improving the Grey-Taguchi method in order to optimize machining parameters for CO 2 LBC. The Variable Weight Grey-Taguchi method is proposed which considering all possible weights to be assigned to the control and noise factors. The considered control factors are stand-off distance, cutting speed and laser power. This study also considers surrounding temperature as noise factor. The superior of these methods is merely depending on the response factors which are Surface Roughness (SR), Kerf Taper Angle (<b>TAP),</b> Heat Affected <b>Zone</b> (HAZ) and Kerf Width (KW). Results from Matlab assisted physical experiment shows there is an effect on weight assigning to the factors. Results also show that the proposed method successfull improved all the response factors. Surface roughness had improved by 49. 4 %, taper 52 %, Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) 9. 3 % and kerf width 46. 2 %. As conclusion, this study had successfully proposed an improved optimization method for LBC process...|$|R
40|$|Water {{samples were}} {{collected}} by the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) from six production wells in 2001 in the Lawrenceville area, Georgia, for analysis of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) to estimate the apparent age of groundwater in a crystalline-rock aquifer (Fig. 1). Apparent CFC ages were calculated by comparing CFCs in groundwater samples to atmospheric CFCs-mixing ratios measured in Niwot Ridge, Colorado, after adjust-ment for recharge elevation (Plummer and Busenberg, 1999; U. S. Geological Survey, 2004). The apparent CFC age is the time since the recharge water was isolated from air in the unsaturated zone and may provide an estimate of groundwater residence time. The apparent CFC ages obtained from the samples ranged from mid- 1950 s to modern (post 1995) (Table 1). The oldest groundwater ages were from samples collected from well 13 FF 21, which derives most of its yield from a single high-yield (120 gallons per minute) water-bearing zone that shows no interconnection with the regolith. The youngest groundwater age was from a sample collected from well 14 FF 55, located about 4, 000 feet from an operating municipal production well; well 14 FF 55 <b>taps</b> multiple water-bearing <b>zones</b> ranging in depth from about 65 feet to about 420 feet. Some of the samples are inter-preted, using the ratios of the CFCs, to represent a binary mixture of young (less than 60 years) and old (greater than 60 years) waters (Plummer and Busenberg, 1999). Using a simple binary mixing model for CFC- 113 /CFC- 12, most of the samples are interpreted to be mixtures of young and old waters, probably derived from different water-bearing zones in each well. Plots of CFC- 113 versus CFC- 12 indicate that {{about one-third of the}} samples lie on or near the piston flow line, indicating groundwater flow can be described in terms of a simple piston-flow system (Fig. 2) Sponsored by: Georgia Environmental Protection Division U.

40|$|The various origins {{proposed}} for intercrater plains on Mercury and the Moon lead to divergent thermal, tectonic, and bombardment histories. Relative ages of geologic units and structures place tight constraints on their origin {{and on the}} planet's geologic history. Crater statistics, lunar geologic map analysis, and geologic mapping of a quarter of Mercury's surface based on plains units dated relative to crater degradation classes {{were used to determine}} relative ages. Such studies provided the basis for deducing the origin of intercrater plains and their role in terrestrial planet evolution. Mercury's extensive intercrater plains span a range of ages contemporaneous with the period of heavy bombardment. Most intercrater plains predate scarp formation and the formation of the hilly and lineated terrain. The age of the latter is identical to that of its probable progenitor, the Caloris basin impact. Post-Caloris plains [...] smoother in texture, less extensive, and confined to crater depressions [...] formed as cratering waned and scarp formation progressed. This research indicates that mercurian intercrater plains are volcanic deposits interbedded with ballistically emplaced ejecta and reworked by basin secondaries and smaller impacts. A greater proportion of ejecta may comprise lunar intercrater plains. Neither the lunar nor mercurian intercrater surface is primordial because each preserves pre-plains crateriforms. Ancient volcanism on Mercury is evidenced by widespread plains distribution, structurally controlled deposition, embayment of craters and basins, associated (but tentative) volcanic landforms, losses of small craters, and uncorrelated plains and crater coverage. The limited range of mercurian ejecta reduces the resurfacing potential relative to that of lunar craters. Crater densities are affected by intercrater plains emplacement, additions of secondaries, ancient basin impacts, and target physical properties. "One-plate" thermo-tectonic models best explain the geologic characteristics recognized in this study. Thermal expansion during core formation causes global extension and widespread volcanic extrusions; subsequent cooling and radial contraction form compressional scarps. Younger plains-forming materials issue from magma reservoirs in subsurface tensional <b>zones</b> <b>tapped</b> by impact fractures. The age and stress environment of these volcanic plains suggest a source greater than 40 km depth and a composition {{different from that of the}} intercrater plains...|$|R
40|$|The area {{described}} {{is almost}} wholly in Nebraska {{and is the}} drainage basin of Lodgepole Creek from the Wyoming State line to the Colorado State line, a distance along the stream valley of about 95 miles. It covers about 1, 950 square miles. The purposes {{of the study were}} to ascertain the characteristics, thickness, and extent of the water-bearing formations and to obtain and interpret data on the origin, quality, quantity, movement, availability, and use of ground water in the area. The rocks exposed in the drainage basin are the Brule formation of Oligocene (Tertiary) age, the Ogallala formation of Pliocene (Tertiary) age, and alluvium of Pleistocene and Recent (Quaternary) age. The Brule formation is mainly a siltstone, which yields an average of 950 gallons per minute (gpm) to irrigation wells <b>tapping</b> its fractured <b>zones</b> or reworked material; the maximum reported discharge is 2, 200 gpm. The Ogallala formation underlies most of the area. It consists of lenticular beds of clayey, silty, sandy, and gravelly materials and supplies water to all wells on the upland, including a few large-discharge wells, and to many irrigation and public-supply wells in the valley of Lodgepole Creek. The yield of irrigation wells tapping the Ogallala formation ranges from 90 to 1, 600 gpm and averages about 860 gpm. The alluvium is present in the valleys of Lodgepole Creek and its tributaries and consists mainly of heterogeneous. mixtures of silt, sand, and gravel, and lenticular bodies of these materials. Between the Colorado State line and Chappell, Nebr., irrigation wells derive most of their water from the alluvium. However, between Chappell and Sidney most of the irrigation wells tap both the alluvium and permeable zones in the underlying Brule formation, and in much of the valley west of Sidney, where the water table is beneath the bottom of the alluvium, irrigation wells derive water from the underlying Brule or Ogallala formations. Irrigation wells obtaining water chiefly from the alluvium have a yield ranging from 130 to 1, 200 gpm, averaging about 770 gpm. In the Lodgepole Creek valley below Sidney the depth to water generally is less than 20 feet and, in many places, less than 10. In much of this part of the area the water table extends to the land surface or to the root zone of the vegetation, and discharge by evapotranspiration is high. In the valley of Lodgepole Creek between Sidney and the Wyoming State line, the depth to water generally ranges from less than 10 feet near the stream to more than 100 {{along the edge of the}} valley. In the upland the depth to water ranges from about 80 to about 300 feet...|$|R
