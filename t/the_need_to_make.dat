5|$|A third frigate {{was visible}} on the horizon. Emerald {{immediately}} set off in pursuit but Duckworth recalled her and instead ordered her to locate the merchant ships; she secured four of the largest vessels by nightfall. <b>The</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the two captured frigates ready to sail delayed Leviathan, {{and by the time}} this was completed the third frigate had made her escape. Leviathan then returned to rendezvous with Emerald, managing to take a further enemy brig before night fell. The following day, both British vessels sailed for Gibraltar with their prizes. On arrival, they encountered Incendiary, which had made port the previous day with two captured vessels of its own. The small British squadron managed to secure nine merchant vessels and two frigates in total.|$|E
5|$|As the {{prospect}} of war with Japan became more likely, so also did <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> appropriate arrangements for leading the defence of Australia. In 1935, Lavarack had recommended that {{in the event of}} war, the Military Board be abolished and its powers vested in a Commander-in-chief. In April 1941, the Minister for the Army, Percy Spender, recommended that this now be done, with Sturdee becoming Commander in Chief of the Australian Military Forces. Instead, the government elected to adopt the British system, in which the Military Board (or Army Council as it was called there) continued to operate, with a separate GOC Home Forces. On 5 August 1941, Major General Sir Iven Mackay was appointed to this newly created post. However, the idea of a Commander in Chief did not go away and editorials in the Sunday Telegraph and The Sydney Morning Herald advocated the appointment.|$|E
5|$|The {{first signs}} of Meyerbeer {{breaking}} with the Italian traditions {{in which he had}} trained are in Il crociato in Egitto. Amongst other notable features of the opera were its lavish orchestral forces (extending to two onstage military bands in the final act). The grandiosity of the work reflected <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an impact on the sophisticated and technologically advanced stages of London and Paris, for which it was extensively rewritten. Meyerbeer's contribution was revealed at this stage to be the combination of Italian vocal lines, German orchestration and harmony, and the use of contemporary theatrical techniques, ideas which he carried forward in Robert and his later works. However Meyerbeer's background in the Italian operatic traditions can be clearly seen as late as 1859 in the 'mad scene' in Dinorah (the virtuoso aria Ombre légère).|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the jockey {{creature}} was not explored in the film, but Scott later theorized {{that it might have}} been the ship's pilot, and that the ship might have been a weapons-carrier capable of dropping alien eggs onto a planet so that the aliens could use the local lifeforms as hosts. In early versions of the script, the eggs were to be located in a separate pyramid structure which would be found later by the Nostromo crew and would contain statues and hieroglyphs depicting the alien reproductive cycle, contrasting the human, alien, and space jockey cultures. Cobb, Foss, and Giger each created concept artwork for these sequences, but they were eventually discarded due to budgetary concerns and <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the film shorter. Instead, the egg chamber was set inside the derelict ship and was filmed on the same set as the space-jockey scene; the entire disc piece supporting the jockey and its chair were removed and the set was re-dressed to create the egg chamber. Light effects in the egg chamber were created by lasers borrowed from English rock band The Who. The band was testing the lasers for use in their stage show on the sound-stage next door.|$|E

25|$|After the Second World War, there {{began to}} be an {{unprecedented}} demand for telephone services. In addition, there was <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> comprehensive repairs, and upgrades to a network which had been severely degraded by war, and lack of investment. Waiting lists for new telephone lines quickly emerged, and persisted for several decades. To alleviate the situation, the Post Office began to provide shared service lines, each known as a party line.

25|$|The Luftwaffe did {{end up with}} an {{air force}} {{consisting}} mainly of relatively short-range aircraft, {{but this does not}} prove that the German air force was solely interested in ’tactical’ bombing. It happened because the German aircraft industry lacked the experience to build a long-range bomber fleet quickly, and because Hitler was insistent on the very rapid creation of a numerically large force. It is also significant that Germany's position in the centre of Europe to a large extent obviated <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a clear distinction between bombers suitable only for ’tactical’ and those necessary for strategic purposes {{in the early stages of}} a likely future war.|$|E

25|$|Two {{facets of}} the result came under {{particular}} scrutiny within the neutrino community: the GPS synchronization system, and {{the profile of the}} proton beam spill that generated neutrinos. The second concern was addressed in the November rerun: for this analysis, OPERA scientists repeated the measurement over the same baseline using a new CERN proton beam which circumvented <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> any assumptions about the details of neutrino production during the beam activation, such as energy distribution or production rate. This beam provided proton pulses of 3nanoseconds each with up to 524 nanosecond gaps. This meant a detected neutrino could be tracked uniquely to its generating 3 nanoseconds pulse, and hence its start and end travel times could be directly noted. Thus, the neutrino's speed could now be calculated without having to resort to statistical inference.|$|E

Cross-platform languages can reduce <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> this tradeoff, though potentially at the expense of high performance on any given node (due to run-time interpretation or lack of optimization for the particular platform).

The coronation took place {{more than a year later}} because of the tradition that holding such a festival is inappropriate during the period of mourning that follows the death of a monarch and also on account of <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> preparations for the ceremony.

500|$|Tiga Dara was {{directed}} and produced by Usmar Ismail for his National Film Company (Perusahaan Film Nasional, {{better known as}} Perfini). Although Ismail had wanted to [...] "not consider commercial aspects" [...] of filmmaking when he established Perfini in 1950, {{he was forced to}} recognise <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a profitable film as Perfini continued to lose money. Following the failures of Lagi-Lagi Krisis (More Crises, 1955) and Tamu Agung (Exalted Guest, 1955), the company's financial situation was bleak, and Ismail fired a number of his staff. With only some leftover government credit to finance his next production, Ismail collaborated with M. Alwi Dahlan to write a film which would be popular with audiences. The resulting story, which may have been inspired by the 1936 musical comedy Three Smart Girls, was Tiga Dara.|$|E

500|$|The Act of March3, 1845 {{authorized}} the first United States postage stamps {{and set the}} rate for local prepaid letters at five cents. [...] In the years following, this rate was seen as too high and an impediment to commerce. [...] Accordingly, Congress on March3, 1851 authorized both a three-cent stamp and a three-cent silver coin. [...] Kentucky Representative Richard Henry Stanton believed that <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> change from a silver half dime with large copper cents might defeat the new scheme, writing to Mint Director Robert M.Patterson that [...] "reduced postage [...] depended on a three-cent coin for use in those states where copper does not circulate."

500|$|As a stop-gap measure, the {{fortified}} vaults in {{the basement}} of the United States Treasury Building were converted into living quarters for the president and his family, to be used in the event an attack came prior to the bunker's completion.

The ten-room presidential suite sat two floors below the cash room behind a steel bank door and was described as [...] "every bit as nice as a suite at the Mayflower Hotel".

Deprived of the original reason for the denomination's existence, no three-cent pieces were struck for circulation in 1886 (though several thousand proof coins were produced), and in the three remaining years of the piece's life, a total of less than 60,000 circulation strikes were minted. As the production of three-cent pieces dwindled, the other non-specie coins prospered, with record numbers of cents being struck in the 1880s to address <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> change, and for penny arcade machines. The nickel proved popular in slot machines and street railways, which often set fares at five cents. With silver again circulating, the three-cent piece became more unpopular because it was almost the same diameter as the dime, leading to confusion and small frauds.|$|E
