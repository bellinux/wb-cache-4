5|$|Although the {{increase}} in jobs for women has had benefits in policy changes for families with working parents, there has been debates about {{the conditions of the}} work places. In Mexico, there is an influx of the maquila industry, which produces products that will be sold in the developed nations. The mostly female workforce is often exploited by having unsafe working conditions, and stress is a major cause of many illnesses of <b>these</b> <b>women.</b>|$|E
5|$|Amnesty International {{called the}} {{conviction}} “a bitter blow {{for freedom of}} expression”. Hugh Williamson, of Human Rights Watch, stated that the “charges and verdict … distort both {{the facts and the}} law.... <b>These</b> <b>women</b> should never have been charged with a hate crime and should be released immediately.” ARTICLE 19, Freedom House, and the International Federation for Human Rights also issued statements condemning the sentence. On September 21, 2012, the Feminist Press published an e-book entitled Pussy Riot! A Punk Prayer for Freedom to raise funds for the legal defense team.|$|E
5|$|Black women {{played a}} minor role in units {{such as the}} Rhodesia Native Regiment, {{accompanying}} the black soldiers into the operational area and performing domestic tasks like washing and cooking. Many of these were local East African women who had formed attachments with RNR soldiers.

Initially, wax and even rice starch were used for printing on fabrics.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the century, some of {{the most}} widely read Russian {{literary}} figures focused on feminist motifs in their works. In his later years, Leo Tolstoy argued against the traditional institution of marriage, comparing it to forced prostitution and slavery, a theme that he also touched on in his novel Anna Karenina. In his plays and short stories, Anton Chekhov portrayed a variety of working female protagonists, from actresses to governesses, who sacrificed social esteem and affluence for the sake of financial and personal independence; in spite of this sacrifice, <b>these</b> <b>women</b> are among the few Chekhovian characters who are truly satisfied with their lives.|$|E
5|$|Bhikshatana {{is often}} {{accompanied}} by women and bhuta-gana (goblin attendants of Shiva). One of the attendants placed {{to the left of}} Bhikshatana should carry a large bowl used for storing the food alms of Shiva. The women, often seven in number, are variously pictured as enamoured of Shiva, eager to embrace him, blessing him, or serving him food in his begging bowl with a ladle. The clothes of some of <b>these</b> <b>women</b> are slipping from their loins, symbolising their lust. The woman giving Bhikshatana alms is also interpreted as Annapurna, the goddess of grain. Various gods, celestial beings, and sages bow to him with folded hands. In some scenes, the sages are depicted as angry and trying to beat Bhikshatana, alluding to the Deodar Forest legend.|$|E
5|$|But it {{was also}} during the mint's second tour of duty that women began to find work at the New Orleans Mint. Several women workers were sent from the Philadelphia Mint to teach those in New Orleans how to adjust money. About this time, the mint {{employed}} forty-four women. Thirty-nine worked as adjusters – employees who weighed the unstamped coin planchets {{to make sure they}} were the proper weight before coining. <b>These</b> <b>women</b> would sit at long narrow tables, filing the planchets down to the proper weight, wearing special aprons with pouches attached to the sleeves and the waist to catch the excess dust. Five women served as counters and packers before the coins were shipped to Washington, D.C. Some women were eventually employed at the coining presses.|$|E

C.J. later sadly relates to Toby how deeply she regretted sleeping with Hoynes. Distressed and in need of comfort, she decides to finally call her college boyfriend Ben, who has been trying to get in touch with her (and been ignored or shunted aside) for quite a while.|$|E
5|$|From Cozumel, {{the fleet}} looped around {{the north of}} the Yucatán Peninsula and {{followed}} the coast to the Grijalva River, which Cortés named in honour of the Spanish captain who had discovered it. In Tabasco, Cortés anchored his ships at Potonchán, a Chontal Maya town. The Maya prepared for battle but the Spanish horses and firearms quickly decided the outcome. The defeated Chontal Maya lords offered gold, food, clothing and a group of young women in tribute to the victors. Among <b>these</b> <b>women</b> was a young Maya noblewoman called Malintzin, who was given the Spanish name Marina. She spoke Maya and Nahuatl and became the means by which Cortés was able to communicate with the Aztecs. From Tabasco, Cortés continued to along the coast, and went on to conquer the Aztecs.|$|E

5|$|On May 7, 1950, Monson {{became an}} LDS bishop at age 22, serving {{for five years}} in two wards. He had {{previously}} served as ward clerk, ward Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association superintendent. At the time, Monson's Salt Lake City ward contained over 1,000 people, including 85 widows whom he visited regularly, and he continued visiting to these widows after completing his service as bishop. He brought them gifts during the Christmas season, including poultry he had raised himself. Monson eventually spoke at the funerals of each of <b>these</b> <b>women.</b> Also during his time as bishop, 23 men from his ward served in the Korean War. He wrote weekly personal letters to each serviceman. At {{least one of these}} men became fully involved with the church as a result of Monson's communication. During his service as bishop of the 6th-7th Ward, sacrament meeting attendance in the ward quadrupled.|$|E
5|$|The Indiana Woman's Suffrage Association {{was founded}} in 1851 by {{important}} suffrage leaders such as Agnes Cook, Mary B. Birdsall, Amanda M. Way, and Mary F. Thomas.

In 1854 Birdsall had purchased The Lily, the first U.S. newspaper edited by and for women, from its founder, Amelia Bloomer, and moved it to Richmond, Indiana. The newspaper had begun as a temperance newspaper but was later used to campaign for women's suffrage and rights.|$|E
5|$|The choreography for {{the ballet}} was {{elaborated}} by the ballerina's father, Filippo Taglioni.

What {{a pleasure to see}} these light women... The set for the ballet was an innovative and striking design by Henri Duponchel and Pierre-Luc-Charles Ciceri. Duponchel had also introduced technical innovations for the staging, including 'English traps' for the sudden appearance and disappearance of the ghosts. (Meyerbeer was led to complain that the spectacle was too much and was pushing his music into the background). Taglioni danced the Abbess only six times in Paris; she was replaced by Louise Fitzjames, (who danced the role 232 times).|$|E

One of <b>these</b> <b>women</b> was fired from a strip club because she started attending Sandals Church, but she continued attending the church, saying that Brown's preaching helped her get through the week.|$|E
5|$|A fairly {{comprehensive}} demographic {{study was}} done by historian John Demos for his seminal 1970 work on the Pilgrims A Little Commonwealth. He reports that the colony's average household grew from 7.8 children per family for first-generation families to 8.6 children for second-generation families, and to 9.3 for third-generation families. Child mortality also decreased over this time, with 7.2 children born to first-generation families living until their 21st birthday. That number increased to 7.9 children by the third generation. Life expectancy was higher for men than for women. Of the men who survived {{until the age of}} 21, the average life expectancy was 69.2 years. Over 55 percent of these men lived past 70; less than 15 percent died before the age of 50. For women, the numbers are much lower, owing to the difficulties inherent in childbearing. The average life expectancy of women at the age of 21 was only 62.4 years. Of <b>these</b> <b>women,</b> less than 45 percent lived past 70, and about 30 percent died before the age of 50.|$|E
