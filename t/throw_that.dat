5|$|Prior to {{the final}} week of the regular season, it {{appeared}} that circumstances might indeed <b>throw</b> <b>that</b> plan into confusion. North Carolina, the ACC's second-place team, had risen to No. 5 in the USA Today Coaches Poll and No. 7 in the Associated Press college football poll, and {{was considered to be}} a candidate for an at-large Bowl Alliance selection. If North Carolina was selected for a higher-tier bowl game, the door would be opened for Notre Dame to play in the 1998 Gator Bowl—a circumstance provided for if neither the first nor second-place ACC team was available to play. In the end, however, ACC runner-up North Carolina was bypassed by Bowl Alliance officials, leaving the team available for the Gator Bowl. Facing the Tar Heels were the Virginia Tech Hokies, second-place finishers in the Big East Conference. Gator Bowl officials considered inviting Big East third-place West Virginia due to its reputation for bringing large numbers of fans to bowl games, but decided against inviting the Mountaineers out of recognition that North Carolina and West Virginia played each other in the 1997 Gator Bowl.|$|E
5|$|With 9:28 {{remaining}} in the quarter, Nebraska's second possession of the game mirrored its first. The Cornhuskers picked up a first down on a Scott Frost throw, but were unable to gain another after being stopped for a loss on one play and had to punt. Following the kick, Virginia Tech took over at its 28-yard line. The Hokies performed better than their first possession, picking up a quick first down on two rushes by Oxendine. Druckenmiller then completed a first-down <b>throw</b> <b>that</b> pushed the Hokies into Nebraska territory for a second time. Druckenmiller rushed for eight yards on the next play, then ran an option with Oxendine that saw the players combine for 20 yards and a first down. Now at the Nebraska 20-yard line, Oxendine ran for a yard, pushing the Hokies into the red zone. On the first play inside the Nebraska red zone, Druckenmiller completed a 19-yard pass to Marcus Parker for a Virginia Tech touchdown—the game's first points. Virginia Tech placekicker Shayne Graham kicked the extra point, and Virginia Tech took a 70 lead with 3:14 {{remaining in}} the first quarter. The drive covered 72 yards and had taken eight plays and 4:06 of game time.|$|E
25|$|After {{the ensuing}} kickoff, Brunell's 52-yard {{completion}} to Chris Cooley moved {{the ball to}} Seattle's 24-yard line. Three plays later, he threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to Santana Moss, a <b>throw</b> <b>that</b> bounced off the shoulder of Seattle cornerback Andre Dyson into Moss' arms. Washington got the ball back when Hall recovered a fumble from Josh Scobey at the Seahawks 40-yard line on the ensuing kickoff. But the Redskins drive stalled at the 18-yard line and ended with no points when Hall missed a 36-yard field goal attempt.|$|E

25|$|Yet law was {{not simply}} a matter of codes and procedures. Law was {{understood}} to reflect the moral universe, and a criminal or civil offense would <b>throw</b> <b>that</b> universe out of balance in a way that only just punishment could restore. The official Five Punishments (wu xing) prescribed under the Qing Code included beating with the light bamboo, beating with the heavy bamboo, penal servitude, exile, and execution. In calibrating punishment, the magistrate had to take into account not only the nature of the offense but the relation between the guilty party and the victim. An offense by a son against a father was far more serious than one by a father against a son, likewise an offense by a wife or other member of the family.|$|E
25|$|The 2013 season {{proved to}} be more {{successful}} for the Eagles. A hamstring injury took Michael Vick out after a 1–3 start, but his backup, Nick Foles, led the team to a 10–6 regular season record, and its seventh NFC East title in 13 seasons. Before throwing his first interception in Week 14, Foles threw 19 touchdowns, which was just one shy of the all-time NFL record of consecutive touchdowns without an interception to start a season, set earlier in the season by Peyton Manning. Foles also tied Manning for most touchdown passes in a single-game with seven against the Oakland Raiders which also made him the youngest player in NFL history to <b>throw</b> <b>that</b> many touchdowns in a game. Foles finished the regular season with 27 touchdown passes and only 2 interceptions, giving him the then-best TD-INT ratio in NFL history. (That record was later broken by Tom Brady, in the 2016 season.) He also finished with a 119.0 passer rating, third highest in league history behind only Aaron Rodgers in 2011 and Peyton Manning in 2004. He was also only the second quarterback in NFL history to have a game in which he topped 400 passing yards and a perfect passer rating. LeSean McCoy finished his Pro Bowl season as the league's top rusher with 1,607 rushing yards (also a franchise record) and 2,146 total yards from scrimmage, also best in the NFL. As a whole, the Eagles offense scored 51 touchdowns, most in franchise history passing the previous season high set back in 1948.|$|E
25|$|Iowa {{started the}} second half with the ball but they would punt the ball to Wisconsin after three plays. Wisconsin {{would do the same}} as they punted the ball back to Iowa. The Hawkeyes drive the ball to the Badgers 35-yard line. On fourth-and-one, Iowa decided to go for it and failed as the Badgers defense stuffed the run up the middle. Still the Badgers {{struggled}} to move the ball on the Iowa defense and punted it back to the Hawkeyes. The Wisconsin punt was downed at the Iowa 1-yard line. On the first play, Iowa tried to pass out of their own end zone. The pass was intercepted by CB Darius Hillary at the Iowa 20-yard line. During that play Iowa starting QB Jake Rudock was injured and would not return to the game. On the very next play, Joel Stave connected with WR Jared Abbrederis on a 20-yard touchdown pass. Jared Abbrederis was injured on the touchdown catch and he would not return to the game. Iowa's backup QB C.J. Beathard would come in but failed to pick up a first down so they punted. Wisconsin tried to move the ball but two holding penalties forced them to punt. Wisconsin punting into the wind again forced a 23-yard punt and Iowa took over at their own 40-yard line. Iowa would again get into the red zone at the Wisconsin 12-yard line but once again they were forced to settle for a 29-yard field goal. Wisconsin would have the ball as the third quarter came to a close with the Badgers holding onto a slight 14–9 lead. The Badgers got to midfield put punted the ball back to the Hawkeyes. The Badgers would get pressure on the Iowa backup QB and forced a bad <b>throw</b> <b>that</b> hit off an Iowa helmet, popped {{up in the air and}} was intercepted by DE Pat Muldoon at the Iowa 25-yard line. Three plays later, RB James White scored on an 11-yard touchdown run. The Badgers defense would again force another Hawkeye punt. Wisconsin took over at their own 24-yard line and on the second play of the drive, James White broke loose for a 59-yard run down to the Iowa 17. The Iowa defense tried to hold Wisconsin but finally James White punched it in with a 2-yard touchdown run giving the Badgers a 28–9 lead. With about and three and a half minutes left in the game, Iowa would again drive into the Wisconsin red zone but failed on fourth down and the Badgers closed out the game with a kneel down.|$|E

Cricket agreed, submitting that due to Fred Morley's absence from the England team due to injury, Crossland was the obvious choice to replace him, as he was the best fast bowler in the country. Despite this, they said that his non-selection showed that his action was not deemed fair by the selection panel. The Morning Post went a step further, and claimed that as Crossland had demonstrated he was England's best fast bowler, he should be selected to play in the Test match if his action was deemed fair, but that if it was not considered fair, he should not be allowed to continue to play for Lancashire either. An article written for The Argus, an Australian daily newspaper, by an unnamed member of the Australian side in 1882 reported that Crossland bowled; [...] "with a delivery so like a <b>throw</b> <b>that</b> I feel sure it would not be allowed in Australia; but, as we all know, throwing in England is just as common as bowling – more's the pity", and it was speculated that the Australian team would have protested had Crossland been chosen for the Test match.|$|E
