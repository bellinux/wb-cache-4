40|$|Both the {{downtown}} and South Tucson areas have {{high rates of}} poverty, unemployment and lack of health insurance. Each of these contributes to a category known as a medically underserved area, and {{is directly related to}} behavioral health issues. These issues include {{but are not limited to}} anxiety, bipolar disorder, substance abuse, depression, eating disorders, personality disorders, schizophrenia, trauma, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. My investigations into this topic have led me to understand that because of the increased amount of care‐seeking patients and shortage of physicians; further healthcare providers are needed to fill the gap. PAs are filling it, particularly because they have the unique ability of working in different fields of medicine without extra schooling. They also have the ability to fill positions in the three different categories in which I organized the patients in South Tucson and downtown Tucson. The categories include wellness and prevention, acute care and chronic health issues. The testimonies and information I received from healthcare providers, patients and public officials are all the patchwork of different people, places and programs that help patients overcome or cope with issues.

40|$|The damage {{tolerance}} of composite laminates can be significantly improved {{by the addition}} of through-the-thickness fibrous reinforcement such as stitching. However, there are numerous stitching parameters which can be independently varied, and their separate and combined effects on mechanical properties need to be determined. A statistically designed experiment (a 2 (sup 5 - 1) fractional factorial, also known as a Taguchi L 16 test matrix) used to evaluate five important parameters is described. The effects and interactions of <b>stitch</b> <b>thread</b> material, <b>stitch</b> <b>thread</b> strength, <b>stitch</b> row spacing and stitch pitch are examined for both thick (48 ply) and thin (16 ply) carbon/epoxy (AS 4 /E 905 L) composites. Tension, compression and compression after impact tests are described. Preliminary results of completed tension testing are discussed. Larger threads decreased tensile strength. Panel thickness was found not to be an important stitching parameter for tensile properties. Tensile modulus was unaffected by stitching...|$|R
40|$|Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining 2014. Mode II {{delamination}} {{properties of}} Vectran stitched composites were investigated, and tabbed end notch flexural specimen testing {{was used to}} prevent premature failure. The effects of stitch density and <b>stitch</b> <b>thread</b> thickness were explored, and fibre compaction due to the stitching process was also verified. The results show that, in moderately stitched laminates (low stitch density), the improvement in GIIC was negligible. Crack bridging by the <b>stitch</b> <b>threads</b> at the crack zone were mostly compensated for the effect of fibre compaction, which reduced the GIIC values. Conversely, in densely stitched laminates (high stitch density), GIIC values were improved significantly (2 · 4 times {{higher than those of}} unstitched laminates). The effects of <b>stitch</b> <b>thread</b> thickness appeared to be negligible in moderately stitched laminates. For densely stitched laminates, thicker <b>stitch</b> <b>thread</b> (500 denier) possessed GIIC values that were 45 · 7 % higher than thinner <b>stitch</b> <b>thread</b> (200 denier) ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{factors that}} {{influence}} in-plane mechanical responses and mode I interlaminar fracture toughness of stitched unidirectional sisal/epoxy laminates were studied in this paper. It was found that in-plane strength and stiffness of the laminates were not significantly affected by the <b>stitching</b> <b>threads,</b> while the interlaminar toughness was greatly improved, especially at higher sisal content. Unlike {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} composites, sisal laminates have a rather high tolerance against the damages induced by stitching process. In addition, stitching expanded the fiber bridging zone and determined the R-curve profiles of sisal laminates. Factors including stitching density, diameter and species of <b>stitching</b> <b>thread,</b> continuity of <b>stitching,</b> and modification methods of sisal, were proved to greatly influence the delamination resistance of the laminates...|$|R
5000|$|The short black lines {{woven into}} the blanket just above the bottom set of stripes are {{referred}} to as [...] "points." [...] About four inches in length (except in the case of half points, which are two inches), they indicate the finished overall size (area) of a blanket and allow a blanket's size to be easily determined while remaining folded. The [...] "point" [...] system was invented by French weavers in the mid-18th-century since then, as now, blankets were shrunk as part of the manufacturing process. The word point derives from the French empointer, meaning [...] "to make <b>threaded</b> <b>stitches</b> on cloth." [...] Although the company had been selling blankets since its founding in 1670, the first Hudson's Bay [...] "pointed" [...] blankets appeared in 1780.|$|R
50|$|Rallis {{are made}} from scraps of cotton fabric dyed to the desired color. The most common colors are white, black, red, and yellow or orange with green, dark blue, or purple. For the bottoms of the rallis, the women use old pieces of tie-dye, ajrak, or other shawl fabric. Ralli quilts have a few layers of worn fabric or cotton fibers between {{the top and bottom}} layers. The layers are held {{together}} by thick colored <b>thread</b> <b>stitched</b> in straight lines. The women sit on the ground and do not use a quilting frame. Another kind of ralli quilt is the sami ralli, used by the samis and jogis. This type of ralli quilt is popular due to the many colors and the extensive hand-stitching employed in its construction.|$|R

40|$|With the {{collapse}} of the TMT bubble and a number of high-profile scandals of corporate governance around the world, the language of finance is being re-written to include market inefficiency. Not surprisingly, there is an increasing premium on market information - national and international. As a consequence, the argument in favour of global standards has gained force, encouraged by new institutions such as the IASB. Co-existence of reporting standards seems a most unlikely prospect just as harmonisation may be less important than convergence to a set of standards deemed to be best practice in terms of global financial performance. With the increasing global significance of institutional investors and their portfolio managers, common standards set within well-defined parameters are clearly on the agenda; convergence {{is the name of the}} game rather than a tapestry of multi-coloured <b>threads</b> <b>stitched</b> together for the sake of expediency. In this paper, we develop these observations paying particular regard to the interests of institutional investors as well as the burgeoning market for global metrics not just national reporting standards...|$|R
40|$|Seam {{quality in}} terms of {{appearance}} and strength were investigated for very light weight fabrics (weight less than 80 g m"). Seams were constructed with different sewing parameters, which included types of <b>thread,</b> <b>stitch</b> densities and needle size. Before constructing the seam for appearance and strength evaluation the mechanical properties of all fabrics were determined. The mechanical properties of 48 fabrics were determined using the Kawabata Evaluation System (KES-F), the Fabric Assurance Simple Test (FAST) and an Instron Tensile Tester. Evaluation of seam quality was performed with respect to all the sewing parameters and the seams were ranked accordingly. The same evaluation ranking for seam appearance and strength was used for further analysis using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) under AMOS. SEM was used to establish the relationship between seam quality with respect to appearance and strength, and fabric mechanical properties. SEM was adopted to perform confirmative analysis to identify the fabrics mechanical properties that influence seam quality. From the experimental work, it was established that seams constructed with 100...|$|R

40|$|Both {{within the}} {{introductory}} essay {{and elsewhere in}} this new collection Karen Warren’s (2000) metaphor of a patchwork quilt, ‘made up of different “patches”, constructed by different quilters in particular social, historical and materialist contexts’, is introduced to describe ecofeminism and the metaphor is extended {{to suggest that the}} collection itself {{can be thought of as}} ‘a selection of “patches” that represent contemporary thinking in ecofeminism’ (1 - 2). If ecofeminism is indeed best represented by the motif of a patchwork then this collection is a fitting contribution, since it brings together a range of very different voices, discursive styles, critical approaches, topics, and perspectives. As in a patchwork, the coherence of the piece is reliant primarily on the linking threads rather than on any innate patterning or similarity of approach within the various ‘patches’. What might be perceived as the <b>threads</b> <b>stitching</b> the various elements together are the urgency of climate change (what one contributor refers to as ‘climate chaos’, 114) and the need to find ways of challenging the mind set of global capitalism, the dualistic Western worldview, and the inertia of governments in finding effective ways of responding to the current crisis...|$|R
50|$|Before {{the advent}} of {{computer}} technology, patches were made by hand. The general process, however, remains the same today. First, a fabric backing is cut to shape.

Some designs incorporate the backing as the background of the patch, while others completely cover the backing with stitches. To finish the patch, iron-on adhesive may be applied to the reverse—a step that was not originally done.|$|R
