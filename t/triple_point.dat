5|$|A report {{published}} in 2007 by the Consultative Committee for Thermometry (CCT) to the CIPM noted that their current definition of temperature {{has proved to}} be unsatisfactory for temperatures below 20 kelvins and for temperatures above 1300 kelvins. The committee was of the view that the Boltzmann constant provided a better basis for temperature measurement than did the <b>triple</b> <b>point</b> of water, as it overcame these difficulties.|$|E
5|$|The {{melting point}} of gallium, at 302.9146K (29.7646°C, 85.5763°F), is just above room temperature, and is {{approximately}} {{the same as the}} average summer daytime temperatures in Earth's mid-latitudes. This melting point (mp) is one of the formal temperature reference points in the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) established by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM). The <b>triple</b> <b>point</b> of gallium, 302.9166K (29.7666°C, 85.5799°F), is used by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in preference to the melting point.|$|E

5|$|Xenon has {{atomic number}} 54; that is, its nucleus {{contains}} 54 protons. At standard temperature and pressure, pure xenon gas has a density of 5.761kg/m3, about 4.5 times {{the density of}} the Earth's atmosphere at sea level, 1.217kg/m3. As a liquid, xenon has a density of up to 3.100g/mL, with the density maximum occurring at the <b>triple</b> <b>point.</b> Liquid xenon has a high polarizability due to its large atomic volume, and thus is an excellent solvent. It can dissolve hydrocarbons, biological molecules, and even water. Under the same conditions, the density of solid xenon, 3.640g/cm3, is greater than the average density of granite, 2.75g/cm3. Under gigapascals of pressure, xenon forms a metallic phase.|$|E
5|$|An {{occluded}} front is formed {{during the process}} of cyclogenesis when a cold front overtakes a warm front. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the <b>triple</b> <b>point</b> in meteorology. It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is not as cool as the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air. A wide variety of weather can be found along an {{occluded front}}, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas.|$|E
5|$|The allotropes {{of carbon}} include graphite, {{one of the}} softest known substances, and diamond, the hardest {{naturally}} occurring substance. It bonds readily with other small atoms including other carbon atoms, and is capable of forming multiple stable covalent bonds with suitable, multivalent atoms. Carbon is known to form almost ten million different compounds, {{a large majority of}} all chemical compounds. Carbon also has the highest sublimation point of all elements. At atmospheric pressure it has no melting point as its <b>triple</b> <b>point</b> is at 10.8 ± 0.2MPa and 4,600 ± 300 K (~4,330°C or 7,820°F), so it sublimes at about 3,900K. Graphite is much more reactive than diamond at standard conditions, despite being more thermodynamically stable, as its delocalised pi system is much more vulnerable to attack. For example, graphite can be oxidised by hot concentrated nitric acid at standard conditions to mellitic acid, C6(CO2H)6, which preserves the hexagonal units of graphite while breaking up the larger structure.|$|E
40|$|In {{this note}} we {{consider}} two configurations of twelve lines with nineteen <b>triple</b> <b>points</b> (i. e., points where three lines meet). Both {{of them have}} the same combinatorial features. In both configurations nine of twelve lines have five <b>triple</b> <b>points</b> and one double point, and the remaining three lines have four <b>triple</b> <b>points</b> and three double points. Taking {{the ideal of the}} <b>triple</b> <b>points</b> of these configurations we discover that, quite surprisingly, for one of the configurations the containment I^(3) ⊂ I^ 2 holds, while for the other it does not. Hence for ideals of points defined by configurations of lines the (non) containment of a symbolic power in an ordinary power is not determined alone by combinatorial features of the arrangement. Moreover, for the configuration with the non-containment I^(3) ⊈ I^ 2 we examine its parameter space, which {{turns out to be a}} rational curve, and thus establish the existence of a rational non-containment configuration of points. Such rational examples are very rare. Comment: 7 page...|$|R

5|$|The {{melting point}} of iron is {{experimentally}} well defined for pressures less than 50GPa. For greater pressures, studies put the γ-ε-liquid <b>triple</b> <b>point</b> at pressures that differ by tens of gigapascals and 1000K in the melting point. Generally speaking, molecular dynamics computer simulations of iron melting and shock wave experiments suggest higher melting points {{and a much}} steeper slope of the melting curve than static experiments carried out in diamond anvil cells. The melting and boiling points of iron, along with its enthalpy of atomization, are {{lower than those of}} the earlier 3d elements from scandium to chromium, showing the lessened contribution of the 3d electrons to metallic bonding as they are attracted more and more into the inert core by the nucleus; however, they are higher than the values for the previous element manganese because that element has a half-filled 3d subshell and consequently its d-electrons are not easily delocalized. This same trend appears for ruthenium but not osmium.|$|E

At temperatures below the <b>triple</b> <b>point,</b> solid acetylene can change directly to the vapour (gas) by sublimation. The sublimation point at atmospheric pressure is −84.0°C.|$|E

25|$|The International System of Units (SI) {{defines a}} scale and unit for the kelvin or {{thermodynamic}} temperature {{by using the}} reliably reproducible temperature of the <b>triple</b> <b>point</b> of water as a second reference point (the first reference point being 0K at absolute zero). The <b>triple</b> <b>point</b> is a singular state with its own unique and invariant temperature and pressure, along with, for a fixed mass of water in a vessel of fixed volume, an autonomically and stably self-determining partition into three mutually contacting phases, vapour, liquid, and solid, dynamically depending only on the total internal energy {{of the mass of}} water. For historical reasons, the <b>triple</b> <b>point</b> temperature of water is fixed at 273.16 units of the measurement increment.|$|E
25|$|The phase {{transitions}} {{in which a}} SAM forms depends on {{the temperature of the}} environment relative to the <b>triple</b> <b>point</b> temperature, the temperature in which the tip of the low-density phase intersects with the intermediate-phase region. At temperatures below the <b>triple</b> <b>point</b> the growth goes from phase 1 to phase 2 where many islands form with the final SAM structure, but are surrounded by random molecules. Similar to nucleation in metals, as these islands grow larger they intersect forming boundaries until they end up in phase 3, as seen below.|$|E

25|$|The {{boiling point}} {{corresponds}} to the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the surrounding environmental pressure.

Boiling points may be published with respect to the NIST, USA standard pressure of 101.325 kPa (or 1 atm), or the IUPAC standard pressure of 100.000 kPa. At higher elevations, where the atmospheric pressure is much lower, the boiling point is also lower. The boiling point increases with increased pressure up to the critical point, where the gas and liquid properties become identical. The boiling point cannot be increased beyond the critical point. Likewise, the boiling point decreases with decreasing pressure until the <b>triple</b> <b>point</b> is reached. The boiling point cannot be reduced below the <b>triple</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
