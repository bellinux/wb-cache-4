This shifts the original focus of feminism away from victimization, and towards harboring understanding, appreciation, and tolerance for all genders and sexes so that all are in control of their own destinies, uncontrolled by patriarchal, capitalist tyrants.|$|E

A decrease is seen from middle age to old age with varying findings on {{whether it is a}} small or large decrease. Reasons for the variability could be because of differences in health, cognitive ability, and socioeconomic status in old age. No differences have been found between males and females in their development of self-esteem.

25|$|It was {{hypothesized}} that interactions between neurotrophic factors could alter the optimal concentrations of each factor. While cell survival and phenotype maintenance are important, the emphasis of evaluation was on neurite extension. A combination of NGF, glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) was presented to Dorsal root ganglion cultures in vitro. One factor from each neurotrophic family was used. It was determined <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> difference in individual optimal concentration and combinatorial optimal concentration; however, around day 5 or 6 the neurites ceased extension and began to degrade. This {{was hypothesized}} {{to be due to}} lack of a critical nutrient or of proper gradients; previous studies have shown that growth factors are able to optimize neurite extension best when presented in gradients. Future studies on neurotrophic factor combinations will need to include gradients.|$|E
25|$|There is no unified or {{centrally}} cleared {{market for}} the majority of trades, and there is very little cross-border regulation. Due to the over-the-counter (OTC) nature of currency markets, there are rather a number of interconnected marketplaces, where different currencies instruments are traded. This implies <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> single exchange rate but rather a number of different rates (prices), depending on what bank or market maker is trading, and where it is. In practice, the rates are quite close due to arbitrage. Due to London's dominance in the market, a particular currency's quoted price is usually the London market price. Major trading exchanges include Electronic Broking Services (EBS) and Thomson Reuters Dealing, while major banks also offer trading systems. A joint venture of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters, called Fxmarketspace opened in 2007 and aspired but failed to the role of a central market clearing mechanism.|$|E

500|$|Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir {{has been}} {{described}} as possibly Bach's first surviving cantata.

It seems likely that Bach was composing choral music at Arnstadt.

In July 2011, Langford revealed that he had seen some comments from people thinking that Lucas and Chris should be paired up. He opined <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> hint of romance between the two and wondered why people assumed that if a gay character shares a scene with another guy, they must get together. Langford revealed that he liked Chris and Lucas's mentor and mentee relationship as it is. The writer also commented on the introduction of Chris's father and said that he was [...] "delighted" [...] that Chris was finally getting his own drama, that was [...] "pretty realistic." [...] He added [...] "It's nice to see the father/son dynamic play out. I have the feeling that a lot of Chris's dad's issues stem from the fact that his son is gay and I hope the show will delve into those unresoved issues." ...|$|E

[...] reviewer gave the opinion that it introduces innovations that add to the game's interest.

Ed Lomas of Sega Saturn Magazine compared the track editor to the MS-DOS version's, and thought it [...] "severely limited" [...] and not as comprehensive, and also criticised Codemasters for releasing the game as a standalone title rather than an add-on cartridge.

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from July 30, 1910. It states: [...] "John Gary runs a summer hotel at a charming spot on the seashore, {{but he has been}} unable to induce people to stop there, and {{at the opening of the}} picture he is seen lamenting the fact <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> single guest name on his hotel register. At this juncture his daughter Ethel returns from school. Ethel is an expert swimmer, and on reading in the paper the rumor that a mermaid has made several appearances in the water of the Atlantic, he decides to have his daughter pose as the mysterious lady of the sea. He wisely conjectures that a handy mermaid will bring guests. With Ethel clad in appropriate costume, and seated upon the rocks in true mermaid fashion, her father persuades the reporter of the local paper to take a look at the phenomenon. The newspaper man is greatly impressed with the spectacle and obtains a photo of the mermaid, which he publishes. The mermaid gains wide publicity - and vacationists arrive from near and far to see her. Tom, Dick and Harry, a trio of city sports, jump into bathing suits and the water, each bent on capturing the mermaid. She eludes them all, however, and the mystery is not cleared up until Ethel, in a pre-tailored suit, presents herself to the guests and explains the joke. By this time Gary's hotel is famous and the owner is certain of a big summer business." ...|$|E
500|$|The Britten scholar Donald Mitchell has written, [...] "It is easy, {{because of}} the scope, stature, and sheer volume of the operas, and the wealth of vocal music of all kinds, to pay {{insufficient}} attention to the many works Britten wrote in other, specifically non-vocal genres." [...] Maw said of Britten, [...] "He {{is one of the}} 20th century's great orchestral composers... His orchestration has an individuality, incisiveness and integration with the musical material only achieved by the greatest composers." [...] Among Britten's best-known orchestral works are the Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge (1937), the Sinfonia da Requiem (1940), the Four Sea Interludes (1945) and The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (1945). The Variations, an affectionate tribute to Britten's teacher, range from comic parodies of Italian operatic clichés and Viennese waltzes to a strutting march, reflecting the rise of militarism in Europe, and a Mahlerian funeral march; the piece ends with an exuberant fugal finale. The Sinfonia moves from an opening Lacrymosa filled with fear and lamentation to a fierce Dies irae and then to a final Requiem aeternam, described by the critic Herbert Glass as [...] "the most uneasy 'eternal rest' possible". Mason considers the Sinfonia a failure: [...] "less entertaining than usual, because its object is not principally to entertain but to express symphonically. It fails because it is neither picturesquely nor formally symphonic". The Sea Interludes, adapted by Britten from the full score of Peter Grimes, make a concert suite depicting the sea and the Borough in which the opera is set; the character of the music is strongly contrasted between [...] "Dawn", [...] "Sunday Morning", [...] "Moonlight" [...] and [...] "Storm". The commentator Howard Posner observes <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> bar in the interludes, no matter how beautiful, that is free of foreboding. The Young Person's Guide, based on a theme by Purcell, showcases the orchestra's individual sections and groups, and gained widespread popularity from the outset. Christopher Headington calls the work [...] "exuberant and uncomplicated music, scored with clarity and vigour [...] fits well into Britten's oeuvre." [...] David Matthews calls it [...] "a brilliant educational exercise." ...|$|E
