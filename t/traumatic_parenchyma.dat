40|$|Kino {{veins and}} /or pockets are a {{characteristic}} defect of some Eucalyp-tus species and {{have long been}} recognized as sources of degrade in eucalypt timber. In a comparative study, the course of both histochemi-cal and anatomical responses of three juvenile Eucalyptus species (E. nitens, E. globulus and E. obliqua) to treatment with an ethylene-releas-ing compound, 2 -chloroethyl phosphonic acid (CEPA), were examined. Kino veins were induced in both E. obliqua and E. globulus. The hor-mone treatment failed to induce kino vein formation in E. nitens. The <b>traumatic</b> <b>parenchyma</b> (that later differentiated into kino veins) was not always derived from the initials of the vascular cambium as reported in previous studies of E. globulus. Instead, the <b>traumatic</b> <b>parenchyma</b> ap-peared to be produced from the meristematic activity of the inner phloem parenchyma. In addition, kino veins found in 2 - to 3 -year-old E. globulus were mostly included in the phloem {{and not in the}} xylem as generally observed in mature E. globulus.

30|$|An {{increase}} in girth within the treated area (Figure 4) {{was similar to}} that reported for balsam fir Abies balsamea (L.) Mill. (Eklund and Little [1996]), indicating that the effect of the ethylene generated from ethephon is limited to the area of application. The thickened cortex displayed deep fissures that did not extend to the xylem. Stereomicroscopic examination of the cut stem revealed that most of the increased growth was due to increased amounts of phloem and cortex rather than the woody portion of the stem. This confirms a previous report (Yamamoto and Kozlowski [1987 a]) where a 1 % ethephon dose, which is approximately equal to the 1 mg ethephon treatment in this study, was shown to elicit the most bark growth. No significant {{increase in}} diameter in the xylem portion of the stem cross sections was observed (see Figure 4) and the increased growth on the xylem side of the mucilaginous xylem consisted of <b>traumatic</b> <b>parenchyma</b> rather than xylem tissue. There was no evidence of increased lignification or increased volume in the woody cross sections. In fact, stems exposed to 1 mg ethephon exhibited an abnormal layer of unlignified tissue in the outer xylem (asterisk in Figure 4 B). This corroborates the down-regulation of a cohort of genes identified via the microarray that are associated with lignin biosynthesis in the xylem which is consistent with a previous claim that ethephon reduced lignification of tracheids in compression wood that developed on the underside of tilted stems of Pinus densiflora (Yamamoto and Kozlowski [1987 b]).|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Scrotal blunt trauma {{may result}} in injuries, such as {{testicular}} rupture, dislocation, torsion, hematoma, spermatic cord injury or contusion, and epididymal, scrotal, and urethral injuries. Ultrasonography (US) has {{a crucial role in}} the evaluation of those kinds of pathologies. Early diagnosis of testicular rupture may lead to the salvaging of the testicle by prompt surgical exploration within 72 h. CASE REPORT: A 21 -year-old male with right scrotal swelling and pain complaints was admitted to another hospital one month ago. Epididymo-orchitis was diagnosed and the patient was given medical treatment. The patient was admitted to our emergency service with ongoing complaints. The patient stated that the pain and swelling suddenly developed after prolonged marching. On US, a large hematoma was detected between the leaves of the tunica vaginalis, and rupture from the lower pole was diagnosed. On color Doppler US, no vascularity was observed in the heterogeneous testicular <b>parenchyma.</b> <b>Traumatic</b> torsion was primarily suggested. Intraoperatively, an extratesticular hematoma, hematocele, and rupture were confirmed but torsion was not found. Because the hematoma entirely replaced the normal parenchyma, orchiectomy was performed. CONCLUSIONS: Testicular rupture may occur even after moderate sportive action such as prolonged marching. If any delay occurs in diagnosis and/or operation, the coagulum may replace the entire parenchyma. We think that US and clinical findings may sometimes mislead the physicians and cause misdiagnoses, such as inflammation or torsion. In this paper, we present a complex delayed diagnosed example case of testicular rupture clinically mimicing epididymo-orchitis and radiologically mimicing traumatic testicular torsion...|$|R
