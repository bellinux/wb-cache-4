5|$|Rodimus, {{being given}} {{half of the}} Matrix, decides to lead {{a search for the}} fabled Knights of Cybertron in the hope that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> restore order to Cybertron. Taking to the stars on board the ship called the Lost Light, Rodimus is joined by Ultra Magnus and Drift as his second-and-third-in-commands, Ratchet, Chromedome, Rewind, Swerve, Brainstorm, Rung, Whirl and a {{reformed}} Cyclonus, among several others. Following an unexpected quantum jump upon launch, the Lost Light is hurled off into the depths of space, where the crew is joined by Skids and contends with a stowaway Sparkeater. A visit to Delphi by Ratchet to help cure a plague introduces the threat of the Decepticon Justice Division, who then feature in a Decepticon-dedicated story menacing a band of misfit Decepticons, and also brings the facility's surviving patients and staff onto the ship—including Fortress Maximus, whose post-traumatic stress causes him to snap and nearly kill Rung. Hoping to cure Rung's damaged brain, Rewind gathers a small group together to recount a shared story from their past about Orion Pax foiling a Senate plot to discredit the burgeoning Decepticon movement in the days of Functionism. Chromedome is manipulated by Drift into carrying out a plan laid out by Prowl: using his mnemosurgery skills to tap the memories and learn the secrets of mass-murdering Decepticon Overlord, secretly hidden on board the Lost Light. Unfortunately, Chromedome accidentally allows Overlord to escape, and Rewind has to sacrifice himself to jettison the monster from the ship before the section of the ship is blown up. Drift admits to responsibility for Overlord's actions, resulting in his exile, even though Rodimus later reveals he {{was a part of the}} plot as well. Ultra Magnus is also fatally wounded in the battle, but when his body disappears from the ship's Medibay, the crew track it to Luna 1, where they discover and foil a twisted plot by Chief Justice Tyrest to wipe out all those Transformers he sees as tainted by original sin.|$|E

25|$|The {{intervention}} of {{artists in the}} design process has been criticized by experts such as anthropologist Victoria Novelo, who claims {{that many of these}} artists “interfere” in the craft process by introducing ideas even though they have no studies in the cultural traditions behind these crafts. She also claims that many college-educated designers believe that with innovative designs, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> the artisan get out of poverty, without knowing why the artisan is poor in the first place.|$|E

25|$|Medical {{trials have}} {{demonstrated}} that vitamin D supplements do not prevent or treat hypertension or cardiovascular disease, although <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> in skeletal metabolism. Epidemiological and observational studies show indications that exposure to ultraviolet radiation, particularly sunlight, might reduce all-cause mortality and can help reduce cardiovascular disease and hypertension. One hundred years of scientific data has demonstrated {{that the effect of}} ultraviolet radiation on human skin is carcinogenic. There is a lack of evidence that this carcinogenic effect, like risks such as smoking or alcohol, is responsible for higher mortality. There are significant archives of studies demonstrating that ultraviolet radiation from sunlight provides measurable health benefits, independent of vitamin D.|$|E

25|$|Because R. romandi nests {{can often}} be found on buildings, {{it is common for}} wasp nests to be built in heavily human {{populated}} areas. Their nests do not cause any structural damage, so if the nests are located in out of the way areas, they are best left alone. Attempting to knock them down will induce the aggressive behavior described above, and R. romandi tend to rebuild nests in similar spots. Additionally, paper wasps feed their young on caterpillars, so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> eliminate common garden and agricultural pests. If one does {{have to get rid of}} a nest, it is recommended that the job is done by a professional exterminator, or with a fast acting can of insecticide. The best time to get rid of an R. romandi nest is at dawn or after dark when the wasps are most docile.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} of marshland to upland for agriculture {{has in the}} past century been overshadowed by conversion for urban development. Coastal cities worldwide have encroached onto former salt marshes and in the U.S. the growth of cities looked to salt marshes for waste disposal sites. Estuarine pollution from organic, inorganic, and toxic substances from urban development or industrialisation is a worldwide problem and the sediment in salt marshes may entrain this pollution with toxic effects on floral and faunal species. Urban development of salt marshes has slowed since about 1970 owing to growing awareness by environmental groups that they provide beneficial ecosystem services. They are highly productive ecosystems, and when net productivity is measured in g m−2 yr−1 they are equalled only by tropical rainforests. Additionally, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> reduce wave erosion on sea walls designed to protect low-lying areas of land from wave erosion.|$|E

500|$|The medical {{approach}} to consciousness is practically oriented. [...] It derives from {{a need to}} treat people whose brain function has been impaired {{as a result of}} disease, brain damage, toxins, or drugs. [...] In medicine, conceptual distinctions are considered useful to the degree that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> to guide treatments. [...] Whereas the philosophical {{approach to}} consciousness focuses on its fundamental nature and its contents, the medical approach focuses on the amount of consciousness a person has: [...] in medicine, consciousness is assessed as a [...] "level" [...] ranging from coma and brain death at the low end, to full alertness and purposeful responsiveness at the high end.|$|E
500|$|In the end, {{many critics}} agree {{that at least}} part of Nancy Drew's {{popularity}} depends on {{the way in which the}} books and the character combine sometimes contradictory values, with Kathleen Chamberlain writing in The Secrets of Nancy Drew: [...] "For over 60 years, the Nancy Drew series has told readers that they can have the benefits of both dependence and independence without the drawbacks, that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> the disadvantaged and remain successful capitalists, that they can be both elitist and democratic, that they can be both child and adult, and that they can be both 'liberated' women and Daddy's little girls." [...] As another critic puts it, [...] "Nancy Drew 'solved' the contradiction of competing discourses about American womanhood by entertaining them all." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{deals with}} the Book of Revelation, {{particularly}} verse 1:18, [...] "I am he that liveth, and was dead; and behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys to Hell and of death". The Millennium Group believes that the four chosen members are the prophesied Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse; although the group believes that fate is predetermined, they believe <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> by [...] "making it happen themselves". Thus, they commit suicide {{in order to be}} resurrected as the Four Horsemen. Donaldson argues that Johnson and the Millennium Group have taken Jesus' promise of eternal life and resurrection too literally, resulting in [...] "a recreated cycle in this life rather than escape into the next". This is further proved when the four Millennium Group members return as zombies; they have achieved life after death, but only physically—not spiritually—by [...] "abusing Jesus's words to take their fate into their own hands".|$|E

500|$|Inside Soap editor, Steven Murphy, {{said that}} the fact Pauline has been such an [...] "enduring staple" [...] will {{make it hard for}} fans to cope with her departure. [...] "It's huge in soap terms... She's a {{character}} people love to hate—you just assumed she would be there forever." [...] When addressing the repercussions that Pauline's exit would have on the soap, Murphy had this to say: [...] "characters like Pauline are like glue, because they're connected to so many other characters and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> hold stories together. In terms of that [...] has very few of those now." [...] Jonathan Hughes, editor of All About Soap magazine, added [...] " [...] an absolute legend... You can't imagine the show without her... People will miss her because she's been such an important part of EastEnders for so many years." [...] However, not all viewers were sorry to hear of the character's retirement, with one commenting [...] "How can you have someone like Pauline Fowler on the television for 21 years? It's the best thing that's ever happened to television [...] Kill her off? I would have blown her up years ago".|$|E

The Others arrive, and while Sayid and Bernard detonate their tents, Jin misses his target, which results in their capture. After hearing only two explosions, James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway) and Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) turn back to see if <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>help.</b> Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia), who was not allowed to accompany Sawyer and Juliet because of his weight, drives the van he found onto the beach, and the captives gain the upper hand, killing the remaining Others with the help of Sawyer and Juliet. Tom (M.C. Gainey) surrenders but Sawyer shoots him anyway.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Wijnberg {{and colleagues}} {{reported}} {{the presence of}} several structurally related antifungal compounds called benzoxepines in the latex of Mycena galopus. One of these compounds, 6-hydroxypterulone, is a derivative of pterulone, a potent antifungal metabolite first isolated from submerged cultures of Pterula species in 1997. The antifungal activity of pterulone is based on selective inhibition of the NADH dehydrogenase enzyme of the electron transport chain. A 2008 publication reported that fatty acid esters of benzoxepine serve as precursors to wound-activated chemical defense. When the fruit body is injured and the latex is exposed, an esterase enzyme (an enzyme that splits esters into an acid and an alcohol in a chemical reaction with water called hydrolysis) presumably cleaves the inactive esterified benzoxepines into their active forms, where <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> defend the mushroom against yeasts and parasitic fungi. In nature, the mushroom is rarely attacked by parasitic fungi, however, it is prone to infection by the [...] "bonnet mold" [...] Spinellus fusiger, which is insensitive to the benzoxepines of M.galopus. In an English field study, where the two fungi M.galopus and Marasmius androsaceus made up over 99% of the fruit bodies in a site under Sitka spruce, the fungivorous collembolan arthropod Onychiurus latus preferred to graze on the mycelium of M.androsaceus. This selective grazing influences the vertical distribution of the two fungi in the field.|$|E
