5|$|A jury {{consultant}} helped pick <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> O. J. Simpson murder trial. Criminologist Jo-Ellan Dimitrius used surveys {{to determine}} the ideal defense juror demographic (black women) and analyzed and judged the prospective jurors' answers to a questionnaire and response and body language during voir dire (the stage of jury selection where lawyers are permitted to directly question the jury). Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi gives more credit to the traditional change of venue. He argues that transferring the case to a section of Los Angeles with more blacks in the jury pool was most detrimental to {{the selection of a}} prosecution-friendly jury. Incidentally, the prosecutor fired her court-appointed jury consultant early in the process.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Sarria {{found himself}} {{at the center of}} a legal {{controversy}} over his role on <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1991 murder trial of Clifford Bolden. Bolden had been sentenced to death in 1991 for the 1986 murder of Henry Michael Pederson, whom Bolden allegedly picked up in a bar in San Francisco's Castro district. Bolden's attorneys claimed that Sarria, who was not on the jury that convicted Bolden but was seated as an alternate for the penalty phase, had known Bolden's lover, Pederson and another of the jurors. They alleged that he had concealed this knowledge in order to remain on the jury and push for a death sentence. Sarria acknowledged having spoken occasionally with the other juror but denied the rest of the allegations. Sarria was cleared of wrongdoing in February 2008.|$|E
5|$|On 18 March 1994, six prisoners {{appeared}} in court {{on charges of}} escaping from custody during the second riot trial. Five of them pleaded guilty to escaping from custody on one occasion, and Mark Azzopardi pleaded guilty to escaping on two occasions. Each was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment for escaping from Manchester Crown Court, and Azzopardi received an additional two-year sentence for escaping from the van transporting him from HM Prison Hull to the court. In July 1994, David Bowen was convicted of attempting to pervert the course of justice by attempting to influence <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first riot trial, {{and was sentenced to}} three years imprisonment. Paul Taylor, who had already pleaded guilty to the same charge, also received a three-year sentence.|$|E

5|$|The {{screening}} of Underbelly in Victoria {{was put into}} jeopardy after last-minute legal proceedings were instituted by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Jeremy Rapke, QC. Rapke secured an urgent viewing of the series, after which he decided to seek an injunction stopping its broadcast in Victoria. A Supreme Court judge called prosecutors and defence lawyers together after serious concerns were raised about whether the show could prejudice <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trial of Evangelos Goussis, who had {{pleaded not guilty to}} the 2004 gangland killing of Lewis Moran. Although Goussis was not named in the series, there were concerns the show could hurt his chance of a fair trial.|$|E
5|$|At the hearing, new {{evidence}} was heard, that heavy rain {{had fallen on}} the ship {{on the second day}} of the killings, but a third batch of slaves was killed after that. This led Mansfield to order another trial, because the rainfall meant that the killing of those slaves, after the water shortage had been eased, could not be justified in terms of the greater necessity of saving the ship and the rest of its human cargo. One of the justices in attendance also said that this evidence invalidated the findings of <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first trial, as the jury had heard testimony that the water shortage resulted from the poor condition of the ship, brought on by unforeseen maritime conditions, rather than from errors committed by its captain. Mansfield concluded that the insurers were not liable for losses resulting from errors committed by Zong crew.|$|E
5|$|Lay and Skilling went {{on trial}} for their part in the Enron scandal in January 2006. The 53-count, 65-page {{indictment}} covers {{a broad range of}} financial crimes, including bank fraud, making false statements to banks and auditors, securities fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, conspiracy, and insider trading. United States District Judge Sim Lake had previously denied motions by the defendants to have separate trials and to relocate the case out of Houston, where the defendants argued the negative publicity concerning Enron's demise would make it impossible to get a fair trial. On May 25, 2006, <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lay and Skilling trial returned its verdicts. Skilling was convicted of 19 of 28 counts of securities fraud and wire fraud and acquitted on the remaining nine, including charges of insider trading. He was sentenced to 24 years and 4 months in prison. In 2013 the United States Department of Justice reached a deal with Skilling, which resulted in ten years being cut from his sentence.|$|E

25|$|Following Judge Hawkins' {{denial of}} the motions for new trial, {{attorney}} George W. Chamlee filed an appeal and was granted a stay of execution. Chamlee was joined by Communist Party attorney Joseph Brodsky and ILD attorney Irving Schwab. The defense team argued that their clients had not had adequate representation, had insufficient time for counsel to prepare their cases, had their juries intimidated by the crowd, and finally, that it was unconstitutional for blacks to have been excluded from <b>the</b> <b>jury.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> question of procedural errors, the state Supreme Court found none.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the book}} Who Killed Karen Silkwood, the {{assassination}} scene in the movie The China Syndrome, in which the character Hector's car is run off the road, {{is based on a}} theorized version of Silkwood's death. In the film, the power plant's agents come up behind Hector's vehicle and ram him, repeatedly, from behind until a device on their front bumper engages his rear bumper and lets them lift the rear end of his vehicle off the road, thereby pushing his car over a cliff. Subsequently, police officers remove the evidence from his vehicle and hand it to the villains because their company's name is on the documents. This could be construed as an attempt by the film's producers to influence <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Silkwood case. According {{to the book}}, it was for this reason that the jury was forbidden from seeing that then-new movie while they were hearing the case and deliberating.|$|E

25|$|At the age {{of twenty}} Penley made his stage debut in 1871 at the Court Theatre, London as Tim, the porter, in a revival of John Maddison Morton's farce, My Wife's Second Floor. The {{following}} year he played in T. F. Plowman's burlesque Zampa at the Court, and performed at the Holborn Theatre in Herv√©'s operetta Doctor Faust. Among the cast of Zampa was Selina Dolaro, whose company Penley joined under the management of Richard D'Oyly Carte at the Royalty Theatre in London and on tour, in 1875. He played {{one of the two}} notaries in Offenbach's La P√©richole, and was in the chorus of its companion piece, Gilbert and Sullivan's Trial by Jury. In November of that year he was promoted {{to the role of the}} Foreman of <b>the</b> <b>Jury</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> latter work when it returned to the Royalty. He continued in the part when the opera played on another tour and in London, at the Opera Comique and the Royal Strand Theatre in 1876‚Äì77. Penley was considered to be an important addition in the small role, with his malleable comic features.|$|E
25|$|The hegemon (·º°Œ≥ŒµŒºœéŒΩ) of {{the court}} was {{responsible}} for the registration of the suits and complaints. After holding a preliminary investigation, he also had to subpoena the litigant parties and the witnesses before <b>the</b> <b>jury.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> morning of the day of hearings, the hegemon had to determine by lot the jury that would judge the case as well as the place where it would convene. After the formation of the jury, the hegemon had to submit the conclusions of his preliminary investigation, announcing and defining the litigation on which the court should decide. Then it was the time for the plaintiff, the defendant and the witnesses to be heard. The arguments were exposed by the litigants themselves, without the legal support of a lawyer, {{in the form of an}} exchange of single speeches timed by water clock. In a public suit each litigant had three hours to speak, whereas they had much less in private suits (though here it was in proportion to the amount of money at stake). In this way the judicial cases became a vehement fight of impressions, since the jurors did not constitute a little group of mature citizens, such as the Court of Areios Pagos, which was interested only in the correct application of the law. Additionally, before the Chambers of Heliaia each citizen had to become an effective orator and to act solely in his capacity as citizen, in order to protect his interests and to enforce his views.|$|E

500|$|In 1993, Andrew Wilson {{was granted}} a new {{judicial}} hearing in his civil case against Burge by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Hastings argued that Mr Justice Channell had misdirected <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> initial case, and that therefore their decision was void. Lord Alverstone dismissed the appeal without hearing {{the other side of the}} argument, saying that he could find no evidence of misdirection.
