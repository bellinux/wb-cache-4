5|$|The {{accessory}} nerve is a cranial nerve that supplies the sternocleidomastoid and <b>trapezius</b> muscles. It {{is considered the}} eleventh of twelve pairs of cranial nerves, or simply cranial nerve XI, as {{part of it was}} formerly believed to originate in the brain. The sternocleidomastoid muscle tilts and rotates the head, while the <b>trapezius</b> muscle, connecting to the scapula, acts to shrug the shoulder.|$|E
5|$|The {{accessory}} nerve is tested by evaluating {{the function of}} the <b>trapezius</b> and sternocleidomastoid muscles. The <b>trapezius</b> muscle is tested by asking the patient to shrug their shoulders with and without resistance. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is tested by asking the patient to turn their head to the left or right against resistance.|$|E
5|$|Injury to the {{accessory}} nerve {{can result in}} neck pain and weakness of the <b>trapezius</b> muscle. Symptoms will depend on at what point along its length the nerve was severed. Injury to the nerve can result in shoulder girdle depression, atrophy, abnormal movement, a protruding scapula, and weakened abduction. Weakness of the shoulder girdle can lead to traction injury of the brachial plexus. Because diagnosis is difficult, electromyogram or nerve conduction studies {{may be needed to}} confirm a suspected injury. Outcomes with surgical treatment appear to be better than conservative management, which entails physiotherapy and pain relief. Surgical management includes neurolysis, nerve end-to-end suturing, and surgical replacement of affected <b>trapezius</b> muscle segments with other muscle groups.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} skull, the cranial {{component}} detaches from the spinal component. The spinal accessory nerve continues alone and heads backwards and downwards. In the neck, the accessory nerve crosses the internal jugular vein around {{the level of}} the posterior belly of digastric muscle. As it courses downwards, the nerve pierces through the sternocleidomastoid muscle while sending it motor branches, then continues down until it reaches the <b>trapezius</b> muscle to provide motor innervation to its upper part.|$|E
5|$|Among {{investigators}} {{there is}} disagreement regarding the terminology {{used to describe}} the type of information carried by the accessory nerve. As the <b>trapezius</b> and sternocleidomastoid muscles are derived from the pharyngeal arches, some investigators believe the spinal accessory nerve that innervates them must carry specific special visceral efferent (SVE) information. This is in line with the observation that the spinal accessory nucleus appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla. Others, consider the spinal accessory nerve to carry general somatic efferent (GSE) information. Still others believe it is reasonable to conclude that the spinal accessory nerve contains both SVE and GSE components.|$|E
25|$|When the clavicular origin is broad, it is {{occasionally}} {{subdivided into}} several slips, separated by narrow intervals. More rarely, the adjoining {{margins of the}} sternocleidomastoid and <b>trapezius</b> are in contact. This would leave no posterior triangle.|$|E
25|$|Variations {{occur in}} the {{extension}} over the face and over the clavicle and shoulder; it may be absent or interdigitate with the muscle of the opposite side {{in front of the}} neck; attachment to clavicle, mastoid process or occipital bone occurs. A more or less independent fasciculus, the occipitalis minor, may extend from the fascia over the <b>trapezius</b> to fascia over the insertion of the sternocleidomastoideus.|$|E
25|$|The {{superior}} {{angle of}} the scapula or medial angle, is covered by the <b>trapezius</b> muscle. This angle is formed by the junction of the superior and medial borders of the scapula. The superior angle {{is located at the}} approximate level of the second thoracic vertebra. The superior {{angle of the}} scapula is thin, smooth, rounded, and inclined somewhat lateralward, and gives attachment to a few fibers of the levator scapulae muscle.|$|E
25|$|The sternocleidomastoid {{is within}} the {{investing}} fascia of the neck, along with the <b>trapezius</b> muscle, with which it shares its nerve supply (the accessory nerve). It is thick and thus serves as a primary landmark of the neck, as it divides the neck into anterior and posterior cervical triangles (in front and behind the muscle, respectively) which helps define the location of structures, such as the lymph nodes for the head and neck.|$|E
25|$|The upper {{region of}} the body (thorax, neck, shoulders, and upper arm) {{seems to be more}} {{susceptible}} for AAS than other body regions because of predominance of ARs in the upper body. The largest difference in muscle fiber size between AAS users and non-users was observed in type I muscle fibers of the vastus lateralis and the <b>trapezius</b> muscle as a result of long-term AAS self-administration. After drug withdrawal, the effects fade away slowly, but may persist for more than 6–12 weeks after cessation of AAS use.|$|E
25|$|During the 2017 season, Kelley {{was among}} the {{relievers}} manager Dusty Baker tried as closer, with Opening Day closer Blake Treinen being demoted due to ineffectiveness early in the season. Kelley himself lost the role by late May, with Baker moving rookie Koda Glover into the position due to Kelley's lack of durability. Kelley experienced dramatic increases in his rates of walks and home runs allowed over {{the first half of}} the season, landing on the disabled list twice (with a lower back strain in May and a right <b>trapezius</b> strain in June) as he struggled to a 7.00 ERA and 4.5 home run rate per nine innings.|$|E
25|$|Abnormal {{scapular}} {{function is}} called scapular dyskinesis. One action the scapula performs during a throwing or serving motion is {{elevation of the}} acromion process {{in order to avoid}} impingement of the rotator cuff tendons. If the scapula fails to properly elevate the acromion, impingement may occur during the cocking and acceleration phase of an overhead activity. The two muscles most commonly inhibited during this first part of an overhead motion are the serratus anterior and the lower <b>trapezius.</b> These two muscles act as a force couple within the glenohumeral joint to properly elevate the acromion process, and if a muscle imbalance exists, shoulder impingement may develop.|$|E
25|$|Pettitte re-signed {{with the}} Yankees for the 2013 season, agreeing to a one-year, $12 million contract. On May 17, 2013, Pettitte {{was put on}} the 15-day {{disabled}} list due to a strained left <b>trapezius</b> muscle. He was activated on June 3, 2013. On June 8, 2013, Pettitte recorded his 250th career win against the Seattle Mariners, becoming the 47th pitcher in Major League history to achieve as many wins. On July 1, 2013, in a game against the Minnesota Twins, Pettitte struck out Justin Morneau, thereby passing Whitey Ford as the Yankees all-time strikeout leader with 1,958. He struck out his 2,000th batter as a Yankee on September 6.|$|E
25|$|The scapula is a wide, flat bone {{lying on}} the {{thoracic}} wall that provides an attachment for three different groups of muscles. The intrinsic muscles of the scapula include {{the muscles of the}} rotator cuff—the subscapularis, teres minor, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus. These muscles attach {{to the surface of the}} scapula and are responsible for the internal and external rotation of the shoulder joint, along with humeral abduction. The extrinsic muscles include the biceps, triceps, and deltoid muscles and attach to the coracoid process and supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, infraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, and spine of the scapula. These muscles are responsible for several actions of the glenohumeral joint. The third group, which is mainly responsible for stabilization and rotation of the scapula, consists of the <b>trapezius,</b> serratus anterior, levator scapulae, and rhomboid muscles and attach to the medial, superior, and inferior borders of the scapula.|$|E
25|$|On June 18, Kelley {{was placed}} on the {{disabled}} list with a <b>trapezius</b> strain amid a dismal stretch that saw him post a rate of 4.5 home runs per nine innings, and right-handed pitcher A. J. Cole was called up from Syracuse to take his place on the roster. Cole did not appear in a game before the Nationals optioned him back to Syracuse on June 22. Difo was recalled the following day for a series against the Cincinnati Reds, with center fielder Michael A. Taylor reportedly dealing with an undisclosed injury. Difo made his first career start in the outfield on June 23, playing center field, but after multiple defensive misplays that led to Cincinnati runs, he was lifted from the game in favor of Raburn. The Nationals defeated the Reds 6–5 behind Goodwin's first career two-homer game and a walk-off single by right fielder Bryce Harper. Taylor returned to the starting lineup on June 24, notching four hits with two home runs in an 18–3 rout of the Reds.|$|E
25|$|The {{spine of}} a horse's back is {{supported}} by muscles, three ligaments, and abdominal muscles. The Spinalis Dorsi originates on the fourth cervical vertebra and inserts beneath the thoracic section of the <b>Trapezius.</b> The Longissimus dorsi originates from the last four cervical vertebrae, and courses along the spine, inserting eventually into the ilium and sacrum. This muscle contracts the spine and also raises and supports the head and neck, and is the main muscle used for rearing, kicking, jumping, and turning. It is the longest and strongest muscle in the body, and is the muscle the rider sits on. The Intercostal muscles begin at the spaces between the ribs and aid in breathing. The external and internal abdominal obliques {{are attached to the}} ribs and pelvic bones, and support the internal organs. The Supraspinous ligament begins at the poll and ends at the croup (sacral vertebrae). It supports the head and neck, and its traction force aids in supporting the weaker thoracic and lumbar areas. It spreads out and attaches to the spines of the cervical vertebrae. In the wither and neck area, it is called the nuchal ligament.|$|E
25|$|On August 28, Scherzer and outfielder Jayson Werth {{were both}} {{activated}} from the disabled list, as Bautista and Stevenson were optioned back to Class-AAA Syracuse and infielder Stephen Drew {{was transferred to}} the 60-day disabled list as he remained sidelined with an abdominal strain. In his return to action, Scherzer threw seven innings of one-hit ball against the visiting Marlins to record the 11–2 win, with Werth contributing with a two-run home run as part of a 2-for-4 day. Sánchez was optioned to Syracuse and outfielder Ryan Raburn moved to the 60-day disabled list with a <b>trapezius</b> injury as the Nationals activated shortstop Trea Turner, out since late June with a broken wrist, from the 60-day disabled list on August 29. Turner led off and doubled in his first game back, an 8–3 victory for the Nationals behind a quality start from Jackson and a strong offensive performance by the second baseman Daniel Murphy and the third baseman Rendon, who combined for seven RBIs in the August 29 contest. The Nationals completed their three-game sweep of Miami on August 30 as Strasburg threw his first complete game shutout since the 2013 season while also hitting a go-ahead home run off Marlins starter Adam Conley, his second of the year. The Nationals tacked on three more runs in the game to win 4–0.|$|E
25|$|The Arizona Diamondbacks led {{off what}} would {{ultimately}} be a 6–5 victory on July 21 over the visiting Nationals with back-to-back-to-back home runs off Scherzer, {{the first time}} in Nationals history that an opponent had blasted three consecutive home runs in a game and the first time it had happened to Scherzer. The Nationals rallied to win the second game of the series behind a revamped pitch arsenal from starter Roark, who befuddled Diamondbacks batters by ditching his four-seam fastball and mixing in a heavier-than-usual dose of curveballs. Facing rookie starting pitcher Anthony Banda in his major league debut, Harper crushed a 467-foot home run onto the Chase Field concourse in right-center field — the longest home run of his career to that point — to extend his hitting streak to a career-best 15 games. Heisey suffered a groin injury while legging out a pivotal triple in the 4–3 contest and was placed on the 10-day disabled list. Left fielder Ryan Raburn was also assigned to the bereavement list, taking leave to attend his grandfather's funeral. Washington recalled catcher Pedro Severino and selected the contract of outfield prospect Andrew Stevenson to take Heisey and Raburn's roster spots. Stevenson made his major league debut in the July 23 rubber game, being inserted mid-game to replace Wilmer Difo in left field and going 0-for-2 at the plate. The Nationals won 6–2, but Strasburg exited the game just two innings into his start with forearm tightness, with Blanton picking up the win in relief. The Nationals announced July 25 that Strasburg had been treated for a nerve impingement. He was placed on the 10-day disabled list, with top pitching prospect Erick Fedde tabbed to make a spot start in his place. Raburn was transferred from the bereavement list to the disabled list with a <b>trapezius</b> strain on July 26. The Nationals recalled Solis to give them an extra reliever the next day, bringing the bullpen up to a total of five left-handed relievers. First base coach Davey Lopes returned the same day after an extended leave of absence.|$|E
500|$|The spinal {{component}} of the accessory nerve provides motor control of the sternocleidomastoid and <b>trapezius</b> muscles. The <b>trapezius</b> muscle controls the action of shrugging the shoulders, and the sternocleidomastoid the action of turning the head. Like most muscles, control of the <b>trapezius</b> muscle arises from {{the opposite side of}} the brain. [...] Contraction of the upper part of the <b>trapezius</b> muscle elevates the scapula.

500|$|Traditional {{descriptions}} of the accessory nerve divide it into a spinal part and a cranial part. The cranial component rapidly joins the vagus nerve, and there is ongoing debate about whether the cranial part should be {{considered part of the}} accessory nerve proper. Consequently, the term [...] "accessory nerve" [...] usually refers only to nerve supplying the sternocleidomastoid and <b>trapezius</b> muscles, also called the spinal accessory nerve.|$|E
500|$|The {{glossopharyngeal}} (IX), vagus (X) and {{accessory nerve}} (XI) all leave the skull via the jugular foramen {{to enter the}} neck. The glossopharyngeal nerve provides innervation to the upper throat {{and the back of}} the tongue, the vagus provides innervation to the muscles in the voicebox, and continues downward to supply parasympathetic innervation to the chest and abdomen. [...] The accessory nerve controls the <b>trapezius</b> and sternocleidomastoid muscles in the neck and shoulder.|$|E
500|$|One-sided {{weakness}} of the <b>trapezius</b> may indicate injury to the nerve {{on the same side}} of an injury to the spinal accessory nerve on the same side (...) of the body being assessed. Weakness in head-turning suggests injury to the contralateral spinal accessory nerve: a weak leftward turn is indicative of a weak right sternocleidomastoid muscle (and thus right spinal accessory nerve injury), while a weak rightward turn is indicative of a weak left sternocleidomastoid muscle (and thus left spinal accessory nerve).|$|E
500|$|Damage to the {{accessory}} nerve (XI) {{will lead to}} ipsilateral weakness in the <b>trapezius</b> muscle. This can be tested by asking the subject to raise their shoulders or shrug, upon which the shoulder blade (scapula) will protrude into a winged position. [...] Additionally, if the nerve is damaged, weakness or an inability to elevate the scapula may be present because the levator scapulae muscle is now solely able to provide this function. Depending on {{the location of the}} lesion there may also be weakness present in the sternocleidomastoid muscle, which acts to turn the head so that the face points to the opposite side.|$|E

2500|$|From {{this type}} of {{research}} it has been inferred that whiplash symptoms might not always have any pathological (injury) explanation. [...] However, over the last decade, academic surgeons in the UK and US have sought to unravel the whiplash enigma. [...] A 1000-case, four-year observational study published in 2012 said that the [...] "missing link" [...] in whiplash injuries is the <b>trapezius</b> muscle which may be damaged through eccentric muscle contraction during the whiplash mechanism described above and below. [...] Another study suggested that [...] "shneck pain" [...] was in the nearby supraspinatus muscle and this resulted from a seemingly asymptomatic form of shoulder impingement. Shoulder impingement is commonly asymptomatic and the shoulder may be injured along with the neck in a motor vehicle accident. [...] Whiplash due to The Referred Shoulder Impingement Syndrome was successfully treated using conventional treatments for shoulder impingement including anti inflammatory steroids and non steroids, and by avoiding the overhead position of shoulder impingement {{during the day and}} night time. [...] All of this work demonstrates that historically and indeed presently whiplash patients' pain sources may be missed if it is outside of the neck. [...] Hence the pathology in whiplash may have been missed and the treatment ineffective.|$|E
2500|$|The {{signaling}} {{process to}} contract or relax the sternocleidomastoid begins in Cranial Nerve XI, the accessory nerve. The accessory nerve nucleus {{is in the}} anterior horn of the spinal cord around C1-C3, where lower motor neuron fibers mark its origin. The fibers from the accessory nerve nucleus travel upward to enter the cranium via the foramen magnum. The internal carotid artery to reach both the sternocleidomastoid muscles and the <b>trapezius.</b> After a signal reaches the accessory nerve nucleus in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, the signal is conveyed to motor endplates on the muscle fibers located at the clavicle. Acetylcholine (ACH) is released from vesicles and is sent over the synaptic cleft to receptors on the postsynaptic bulb. The ACH causes the resting potential to increase above -55mV, thus initiating an action potential which travels along the muscle fiber. Along the muscle fibers are t-tubule openings which facilitate {{the spread of the}} action potential into the muscle fibers. The t-tubule meets with the sarcoplasmic reticulum at locations throughout the muscle fiber, at these locations the sarcoplasmic reticulum releases calcium ions that results in the movement of troponin and tropomyosin on thin filaments. The movement of troponin and tropomyosin is key in facilitating the myosin head to move along the thin filament, resulting in a contraction of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.|$|E
