30|$|A <b>tanned</b> {{appearance}} can {{be achieved}} through three different methods: sunbathing, <b>tanning</b> beds, and sunless <b>tanning</b> product use. As a result of increased public awareness of skin cancer, the sunless <b>tanning</b> product market has grown considerably (Stryker et al. 2007). Sunless <b>tanning</b> products are defined as Non-UV induced <b>tanning</b> methods which refers to over-the-counter lotions or spray <b>tans</b> applied in the home or at salons (Paul et al. 2011). The Center for Disease and Control Prevention promoted the use of sunless <b>tanning</b> products as a safer alternative to UV-induced tanning; therefore, sunless <b>tanning</b> products have emerged as a practical and healthy alternative to UV-induced <b>tanning.</b>|$|R

The popularity of sunless <b>tanning</b> has risen since the 1960s after health authorities confirmed links between UV exposure (from sunlight or <b>tanning</b> beds) and the incidence of skin cancer.|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{identify}} indoor <b>tanning</b> {{patterns with}} relevance for health screening and prevention efforts. Design We collected data on indoor <b>tanning</b> patterns from January 17, 2006, through April 14, 2006. By cluster analysis, 4 patterns of indoor <b>tanning</b> were identified: special event, spontaneous or mood, mixed, and regular year-round <b>tanning.</b> These 4 types of indoor <b>tanning</b> were compared by demographic, behavioral, and psychosocial variables for clinically significant differences. Setting Midsized (ie, approximately 12 000 students) southeastern university. Participants A total of 168 women who <b>tanned</b> indoors. Main Outcome Measures Self-reported attitudes, intentions and <b>tanning</b> behaviors, and <b>tanning</b> dependence. Results Event tanners <b>tanned</b> the least, started <b>tanning</b> the latest, and scored lowest {{on measures of}} attitudes, social norms, and <b>tanning</b> dependence measures. Regular year-round tanners started the earliest, <b>tanned</b> at the highest levels, and scored the highest on the attitude, social norms, and <b>tanning</b> dependence measures. Spontaneous or mood tanners were similar to event tanners but with a mood component to their <b>tanning.</b> Mixed tanners, as the name implies, exhibited behavior {{that appeared to be}} a mixture of the regular and event <b>tanning</b> types. Conclusions The results of this study emphasize the fact that "one size fits all" does not apply when it comes to indoor <b>tanning.</b> <b>Tanning</b> behavioral types, which can be clinically assessed, can serve as a guide to physicians so that they can tailor their skin cancer prevention messages to be more effective...|$|R

30|$|Sunless <b>tanning</b> {{products}} {{have become more}} readily available since the first sunless <b>tanning</b> lotion {{was introduced in the}} 1960 s (Owens 2007). Some argue that use of a sunless <b>tanning</b> product has a negative correlation with the use of UV-induced <b>tanning.</b> A recent pilot survey with 121 individuals who used a spray sunless <b>tanning</b> treatment revealed that most respondents reported that they would not change their time spent in the sun or sunscreen use as a result of using sunless <b>tanning.</b> However, 73 % of those who had reported using <b>tanning</b> beds stated that they had or would decrease <b>tanning</b> bed use (Sheehan and Lesher 2005). Building on the current literature, {{the results of the study}} will serve in the following ways: first, understanding the attitudes toward sunless <b>tanning</b> products will establish alternative <b>tanning</b> methods that healthcare providers can suggest to individuals who actively engage in UV-induced tanning; second, understanding positive attitudes toward sunless <b>tanning</b> products can aid in the development of new marketing strategies.|$|R
40|$|DOI: 10. 1177 / 1359105306063325 This study {{investigated}} cognitive predictors of <b>tanning</b> salon use, based on Jaccard’s Theory of Alternative Behavior. A total of 164 undergraduates completed questionnaires that assessed <b>tanning</b> salon use, attitudes toward <b>tanning</b> salon use {{and attitudes toward}} behavioral alternatives for enhancing appearance, relaxing and socializing. Results indicated that attitudes toward alternatives for enhancing appearance were not significantly related to <b>tanning</b> salon use. However, favorable attitudes toward engaging in a hobby to relax {{and going to the}} gym to socialize were inversely related to frequency of <b>tanning</b> salon use. Findings suggest that interventions for reducing skin cancer risk should focus not only on decreasing favorable attitudes toward <b>tanning,</b> but also on increasing favorable attitudes toward healthier alternatives to <b>tanning</b> salon use.

40|$|The leather {{industry}} transforms raw {{hides and skins}} into high-performance leather products. This transformation requires a high usage of chemicals. About 90 % of all leather products are <b>tanned</b> by basic chromium sulphate <b>tanning</b> agents. The use of large quantities of <b>tanning</b> agent causes elevated chromium and sulphate concentrations in the wastewater of conventional tanneries. This article focuses on the reduction of <b>tanning</b> agent consumed by the chromium <b>tanning</b> procedure. Compressed carbon dioxide is used to intensify the process. Carbon dioxide-intensified <b>tanning</b> at 60 bar allows the production of high-quality leather by using about 50 wt% less of <b>tanning</b> agent compared to the conventional <b>tanning</b> process.
