Supporters pointed to his efforts to raise <b>the</b> <b>salaries</b> <b>of</b> teachers and improve educational test scores.|$|E

The Persian Gulf states, led by Kuwait, raised money for them through a 5% tax on <b>the</b> <b>salaries</b> <b>of</b> their {{tens of thousands of}} resident Palestinian workers, and a fund drive in Lebanon raised $500,000 from Beirut alone. The Palestinian organizations began to guarantee a lifetime support for the families of all guerrillas killed in action.

5|$|Despite all {{receiving}} equal billing in the credits, {{the original}} principal cast members were paid different salaries {{in the first}} few years; Baxendale and Nesbitt were the most well-known, so received more than Ripley, Thomson, Norris and Bathurst, who were comparatively less well-known to audiences. Prompted by the continued success of the show, Andy Harries reviewed the salaries in 2000 and decided to pay all six actors the same amount. The amount was not publicly disclosed but was believed to be £20,000 per episode, plus repeat broadcast royalties. Another pay deal for the fourth series in 2001 increased <b>the</b> <b>salaries</b> <b>of</b> the cast to £50,000. For the final series in 2003, they each received £75,000 an episode.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated {{by their}} defeats in the judiciary, the Relief Party turned its {{attention}} to the gubernatorial election of 1824, where they backed General Joseph Desha. Desha's election by the overwhelming vote of 38,37822,499 was seen by the party as a mandate to pursue the relief agenda. An early proposal to reduce <b>the</b> <b>salaries</b> <b>of</b> the Court of Appeals justices to 25 cents per year was discarded without a vote, but the House of Representatives mustered the votes to remove the offending justices. The justices were spared removal when the Senate failed to pass the measure with a two-thirds majority. The vote was 2312.|$|E

5|$|Life in Nelson {{was hard}} for the colonists. The company had limited {{finances}} and tightened its expenditure which affected <b>the</b> <b>salaries</b> <b>of</b> its employees. In 1844, it had to halt its operations for a time. Although Nelson had 300 landowners, nearly two thirds were absentee owners and only 80 actually lived in the town. Brunner lived at Riwaka, a nearby village, and, in addition to carrying out survey work along the Motueka River, helped {{in the design and}} building of houses in the area. He ended his service with the company in August 1844.|$|E
5|$|Sledd's {{advocacy}} {{of social change}} and an evolving understanding of biblical texts came at a high personal price. Given his chosen career of minister and professor, he never accumulated much personal wealth. Sledd died deep in debt, having lost the family home to foreclosure after <b>the</b> <b>salaries</b> <b>of</b> Candler professors were cut when financial support of the school fell during the Great Depression in the 1930s. His creditors obtained a deficiency judgment for the unpaid portion of his debt after the foreclosure and, following his death, forced the sale {{of some of his}} furniture and parts of his personal library in partial satisfaction of his remaining debts.|$|E
5|$|The College {{is almost}} entirely self-financed, {{and is not a}} {{recipient}} of any regular public funding. Its officers do have official salaries, which {{are paid for by the}} Crown. <b>The</b> <b>salaries</b> <b>of</b> the officers were raised during the reign of King James I, but were reduced under William IV. These salaries per annum reflected the living costs of the day; however today the amount is seen only as nominal payment. In addition to their official duties, the heralds have for many centuries undertaken private practice in heraldry and genealogy, for which professional fees are charged.|$|E

5|$|The {{estimation}} that 300 senators were proscribed {{was presented}} by Appian, although his earlier contemporary Livy asserted that only 130 senators had been proscribed. This decree {{issued by the}} triumvirate was motivated {{in part by a}} need to raise money to pay <b>the</b> <b>salaries</b> <b>of</b> their troops for the upcoming conflict against Caesar's assassins, Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger and Gaius Cassius Longinus. Rewards for their arrest gave incentive for Romans to capture those proscribed, while the assets and properties of those arrested were seized by the triumvirs.|$|E
5|$|The federal {{government}} paid <b>the</b> <b>salaries</b> <b>of</b> the governor, legislature, and judicial council, {{but did not}} provide funds for any additional governmental offices. At first, the territory had very limited revenue and {{could not afford to}} fund a large government. As the population increased, and revenues grew, so did the size and scope of the government with new offices being created at different times. The territory's primary source of revenue was from the sale of federal lands; the territory collected 3% of the proceeds of each sale. Property tax and trading ventures with the Native American tribes also provided lesser revenues.|$|E

The Friends of SCPA (commonly known as The Friends), a nonprofit {{organization}} led by parents and members of the business and arts communities, had been a vital source of funding since the school's inception. In 1984, The Friends raised over $400,000 to pay <b>the</b> <b>salaries</b> <b>of</b> the artistic director, technical director, costume designer, and dance, strings, and production teachers. In later years, The Friends raised up to $1million each year through special events, corporate gifts and sponsorships, advertising sales, and other programs to support the artistic needs of the school including staff salaries, production expenses, scholarships for private lessons, and artists in residence.|$|E
5|$|A {{struggle}} over {{the power of the}} purse brought Adams back into the political limelight. Traditionally, the Massachusetts House of Representatives paid <b>the</b> <b>salaries</b> <b>of</b> the governor, lieutenant governor, and superior court judges. From the Whig perspective, this arrangement was an important check on executive power, keeping royally appointed officials accountable to democratically elected representatives. In 1772, Massachusetts learned that those officials would henceforth be paid by the British government rather than by the province. To protest this development, Adams and his colleagues devised a system of committees of correspondence in November 1772; the towns of Massachusetts would consult with each other concerning political matters via messages sent through a network of committees that recorded British activities and protested imperial policies. Committees of correspondence soon formed in other colonies, as well.|$|E
5|$|After taking office, Booker voluntarily reduced his own salary twice, {{reducing}} {{his salary}} by 8% {{early in his}} first year as mayor. He also raised <b>the</b> <b>salaries</b> <b>of</b> many city workers. However, his administration imposed one-day-a-month furloughs for all non-uniformed employees from July through December 2010, as well as 2% pay cuts for managers and directors earning more than $100,000 a year. In 2008 and 2009 the City of Newark received the Government Finance Officers Association's Distinguished Budget Presentation Award. In an effort to make government more accessible, Booker held regular open office hours during which city residents can meet with him personally to discuss their concerns. In 2010, Booker was among the finalists for the World Mayor prize, ultimately placing seventh. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the 2012 award.|$|E

5|$|Combs {{created a}} merit system for state {{government}} workers, ensuring that officials {{could not be}} hired or fired for political reasons. This provision attracted more well-qualified people to public service careers. Such careers were made even more attractive when, in 1962, the state courts declared that <b>the</b> <b>salaries</b> <b>of</b> state employees, the amounts of which were specified in the state constitution, could be adjusted for inflation. Combs demanded that state employees stick strictly to the rules governing their offices. In one instance, Combs ordered a state audit of Carter County superintendent Heman McGuire, who was known to use his office for political gain. While Combs {{did not have the}} authority to remove McGuire directly, the audit showed McGuire's misappropriation of funds and abuse of power. The state school board investigated these findings and removed the county school board members from office; the replacement board members then ousted McGuire.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{believed}} that Congressional business was too slow and tedious, {{and that the}} per diem system of compensation encouraged delays {{on the part of}} members. To remedy this, he sponsored the Compensation Act of 1816. The measure proposed paying annual salaries of $1,500 to congressmen rather than a $6 per diem for the days the body was in session. (At the time, this had the effect of increasing the total compensation from about $900 to $1500. Johnson noted that congressmen had not had a pay increase in 27 years, and that $1500 was less than <b>the</b> <b>salaries</b> <b>of</b> the 28 clerks employed by the government.) Johnson's bill provided that if a congressman was absent, his salary would be reduced proportionally.|$|E
5|$|The Cabinet {{generally}} directs {{and controls}} the Government and is collectively responsible to Parliament. It also has significant influence over lawmaking. Ministers may be {{designated by the}} Prime Minister {{to be in charge}} of particular ministries, or as Ministers in the Prime Minister's Office. Singapore's ministers are among the best paid in the world. Prior to a salary review in 2011, the Prime Minister's annual salary was S$3.07 million, while the pay of ministerial-grade officers ranged between S$1.58 million and S$2.37 million. On 21 May 2011, a committee was appointed by the Prime Minister to review <b>the</b> <b>salaries</b> <b>of</b> the Prime Minister as well as the President, political appointment holders, and Members of Parliament. Following the recommended wage reductions by the committee which were then debated and subsequently accepted in Parliament, the Prime Minister's salary was reduced by 36% (includes the removal of his pension) to S$2.2 million (then about US$1.7 million). Nonetheless, the Prime Minister remains the highest-paid political leader in the world.|$|E
