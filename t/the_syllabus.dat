40|$|The aim of {{this essay}} was to {{investigate}} how <b>the</b> <b>syllabuses</b> of religious education have changed from 1970 – 2011. To do this the following questions were answered: How have <b>the</b> <b>syllabuses</b> of religious education changed from 1970 – 2011 ? What has been removed and what has been added? How have the training course objectives changed? How has the content of <b>the</b> <b>syllabuses</b> changed? <b>The</b> method used in this essay is content analysis. The results of this essay show that the content of <b>the</b> <b>syllabuses</b> has not changed, although it is now described in further detail. <b>The</b> modern <b>syllabuses</b> are far more detailed then <b>the</b> oldest <b>syllabus.</b> One conclusion was that Christianity was the only expressly named religion...|$|R
40|$|The thesis takes {{a closer}} look at the {{foundation}} course in English with particular interest in textbook activities. The main objective is to see if and to what extent changes in <b>the</b> <b>syllabuses</b> are reflected in the types of activities in the textbooks. A hypothesis is presented initially: the gradual increased focus on the communicative approach in teaching has resulted in a shift from reproductive exercises and drills to more functional and open-ended activities. The thesis discusses briefly the theoretical background to teaching English as a foreign language, as well presenting and discussing <b>the</b> <b>syllabuses</b> from 1976 and 1994. Based on this theoretical presentation the thesis puts forth a system of classifying activities. This typology is used in order to analyse two textbooks, namely Scope which is based on <b>the</b> 1976 <b>syllabus</b> and Passage which is based on <b>the</b> 1994 <b>syllabus.</b> <b>The</b> results are seen both in relation to <b>the</b> <b>syllabuses</b> and <b>the</b> prevalent TEFL theories. The development and changes of the textbook activities are discussed. The thesis' main findings verified the hypothesis, although the number of open-ended activities did not form the majority expected. The findings can be explained with current reading theories, the Reader-Response theory, schema theory and theories and hypotheses of interaction and interactional activities...|$|R

5|$|David Margoliouth (professor 1889–1937) taught <b>the</b> <b>syllabus</b> for {{the final}} {{examinations}} in lectures over two years, forcing some students to tackle the more difficult texts {{in their first year}} of study. Successive professors had few students until after the Second World War, when numbers increased because of the reputation of the then professor, Gibb, and because some British students became interested in Arabic culture while serving in the Middle East during the war. Julia Bray, the Laudian Professor , was appointed in 2012 and is the first woman to hold the position. She is a member of Oxford's Faculty of Oriental Studies, based at the Oriental Institute.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to demands for more aircrew to fulfil Australia's commitments to the Korean War and Malayan Emergency, flying training underwent {{major changes in}} 1951–52, <b>the</b> <b>syllabus</b> at No.1 FTS being split among three separately located units. No.1 Initial Flying Training School (No.1 IFTS) was raised at RAAF Station Archerfield, Queensland, to impart students with general aeronautical and military knowledge, after which they received their flight grading during twelve hours on Tiger Moths. Graduate pilots of No.1 IFTS {{went on to the}} newly formed No.1 Basic Flying Training School (No.1 BFTS) at Uranquinty, where they underwent a further 90 hours of aerial instruction that included instrument, formation and night flying, first on Tiger Moths and then on Wirraways. Successful students finally transferred to No.1 FTS, which was renamed No.1 Applied Flying Training School (No.1 AFTS) in March 1952. There they undertook 100 flying hours of advanced weapons and combat training on Wirraways, before graduating as sergeant pilots. RAAF College, formed at Point Cook in 1947, was to be the Air Force's primary source of commissioned officers. The Tiger Moths and Wirraways of No.1 BFTS were subsequently replaced by the CAC Winjeel, first delivered in 1955.|$|E
5|$|The {{professorship}} {{was suspended}} for {{two years after the}} death of Robert Gandell in 1887. The electoral board had met to select a successor, but were unable to make a suitable appointment, and so obtained the permission of the university authorities to adjourn. When the board resumed in 1889, one of the previous applicants, David Margoliouth, re-applied for the position and was successful, even though none of the people recommending him made any mention of whether he knew any Arabic. As professor, Margoliouth taught <b>the</b> <b>syllabus</b> for the final examinations in lectures over two years, regardless of the stage that students had reached, and regarded it as bad luck if a student had to tackle the more difficult texts in one year and the easier texts in the next.|$|E
30|$|Even though <b>the</b> <b>syllabuses</b> {{prescribe}} {{a significant}} number of goals and skills, the findings suggest that a number of these skills are not acquired by the students during their participation in the project. At the same time, this study shows that students develop other kinds of competence that are not necessarily reflected within <b>the</b> course <b>syllabuses.</b> So, there are differences between the types of competence stated by <b>the</b> course <b>syllabuses</b> and what <b>the</b> students actually are able to learn from this project. For the purposes of reporting the findings below, the stated areas of competence are divided into course-based goals and complementary competence.|$|R

5|$|When No.1 BFTS {{formed at}} Uranquinty on 1December 1951, it had 377 staff, 37 Tiger Moths and 37 Wirraways, and {{came under the}} control of Headquarters Southern Area (Training Command from 1October 1953). The first pilots' course {{commenced}} on 1April 1952, and graduated on 1August. The first course of graduates from No.1 IFTS transferred in the same month. As well as RAAF pilots, No.1 BFTS trained students from the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Navy's Fleet Air Arm. In February 1953, a prototype CAC Winjeel, designed and manufactured in Australia, arrived at the school to undergo trials. From January 1956 to February 1957, the Winjeel gradually replaced both the Tiger Moth and the Wirraway as No.1 BFTS's training aircraft. As well as these aircraft, Link Trainer instrument flying simulators were employed at the school. By November 1954, following the end of the Korean War, the RAAF's need for further aircrew to fulfill its international obligations had eased and {{the decision was made to}} combine <b>the</b> <b>syllabus</b> of No.1 IFTS with No.1 BFTS starting in January 1955, after which No.1 IFTS was disbanded.|$|E
5|$|Wrigley {{travelled}} to England in 1928 {{to attend}} RAF Staff College, Andover, {{becoming one of}} the first RAAF officers to complete the course. Remaining in England, he was appointed Australian Air Liaison Officer to the Air Ministry in 1929. That October, he initiated correspondence with the British Air Council to discuss a proposal for the RAAF to adopt as its own the Royal Air Force's motto Per Ardua Ad Astra; informal approval was granted by letter to Wrigley in March 1930. Returning to Australia, he became Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters in October 1930, and Director of Organisation and Staff Duties in December 1931. He was promoted to wing commander in December 1932. In 1935 he published his history of No.3 Squadron, The Battle Below, which was considered an authoritative treatment on the subject of army co-operation. He was promoted group captain in July 1936, and that October took over as commanding officer of RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, from Group Captain McNamara. Wrigley handed over the station's command to Group Captain Adrian Cole in February 1939. In May 1939, Wrigley served as the senior expert assessor on the panel of an inquiry into three recent accidents involving Avro Ansons; the full report handed down in October found that training on the type followed <b>the</b> <b>syllabus,</b> but that pilots needed more practical experience in dealing with in-flight incidents, as human error was the likely explanation for at least one crash.|$|E

40|$|African Traditional Religion, ATR, forms part of African Indigenous Knowledge. The {{two senior}} {{secondary}} school Religious Education syllabuses in Zambia have {{a component of}} African traditional religion or beliefs which the learners are supposed to understand and compare with other religious traditions in <b>the</b> <b>syllabuses.</b> <b>The</b> other religions in <b>the</b> <b>syllabuses</b> are Christianity, Hinduism and Islam. This study sets out to explore how ATR is actually taught and learned in class so as to ascertain whether traditional beliefs are appreciated and given space in the Western hegemonic kind of education. To get full understanding {{of the position of}} ATR in <b>the</b> Religious Education <b>syllabuses,</b> a mixed data collection strategy was employed to allow for methodological triangulation to achieve greater validity and reliability. Document analysis of pupils’ text books and teachers’ handbooks was done. In addition, semi-structured interviews were carried out with teachers, pupils and the Religious Education subject specialist. A questionnaire was also administered to some pupils to augment the responses obtained through semi-structured interviews with pupils. Lastly, classroom ethnography was done to observe the actual teaching of ATR in Religious Education. Findings of the study show that African Traditional Religion is not given due attention in <b>the</b> <b>syllabuses.</b> To begin with, most of the content of ATR in the pupils’ textbooks is presented in a manner which suggests that the religion or belief is dead and no longer applicable in present day Zambia. Secondly, some teachers are not conversant and willing enough to teach this body of knowledge to the pupils. On the other hand, while a small proportion of the pupils in the study did not see the need to learn this part of <b>the</b> Religious Education <b>syllabus,</b> <b>the</b> majority acknowledged that ATR would be beneficial to their lives if it was properly taught to them.
