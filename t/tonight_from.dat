25|$|Leno's Tonight Show started rocky; {{prior to}} Letterman's move, NBC {{considered}} matching CBS's offer to allow Letterman {{to take over}} from Leno. Letterman beat Leno {{for nearly two years}} until August 1995, when Leno welcomed British actor Hugh Grant, who had recently been arrested for soliciting a prostitute ("What the hell were you thinking?", Leno asked, to applause), to a previously-booked appearance on <b>Tonight.</b> <b>From</b> that point on, Letterman slipped below Leno in the ratings, and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno remained number one for the rest of its run.|$|E
25|$|Though Leno was {{the first}} to move the entire five-day-a-week late night talk show to prime time, he was not the first Tonight alumnus to move from late night to a prime time talk show. Steve Allen hosted Tonight Starring Steve Allen from 1954 to 1957; while still hosting that show, he began hosting the prime-time The Steve Allen Show in 1956 on NBC, and the latter show would run until 1960. Jack Paar, who hosted <b>Tonight</b> <b>from</b> 1957 to 1962, next hosted a weekly talk show known as The Jack Paar Program that ran until 1965, also on NBC.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Abby West {{expressed}} {{praise for}} an episode that [...] "restored balance and order to our favorite paper-pushers while still nicely forwarding the storylines of TV's plainest super-non-couple." [...] West was also pleased [...] "to have Michael {{back to his}} usual insanity", and wrote that Pam [...] "was priceless <b>tonight,</b> <b>from</b> the spot-on reaction shots to the movie-plotlines-as-my-pain gag she started to the almost-believably tender eulogy she delivered for the singing, er, impressionist bird, complete with the most tricked-out pencil-case coffin you've ever seen." [...] Television Without Pity graded the episode with a B–. Michael's monologue about the five stages of grief has also been isolated for praise; Michael Sciannamea called it [...] "the best line of the night," [...] and in 2011, IGN's Cindy White selected {{it as one of}} the series' best.|$|E

500|$|On 6 September 2007, {{the tabloid}} current affairs program Today <b>Tonight</b> <b>from</b> the Seven Network aired a story headed [...] "Dangerous Fools", {{specifically}} {{devoted to the}} APEC stunt. Host Anna Coren asserted that The Chaser were wasting taxpayers' money, and will [...] "need more of those funds [...] to defend their actions in court". Coren claimed that the ABC chiefs were too arrogant to reply to the program's inquiries. A media commentator interviewed in the report condemned the APEC stunt as [...] "over the top", and {{said he could not}} see the humour of it. A security expert presented his view, saying that there was a serious risk of injury, not just to the crew members, but to onlookers outside the security zone, even though the breach was discovered by police officers well inside the prohibited area.|$|E
500|$|Jennifer Armstrong of Entertainment Weekly also {{praised the}} pairing, {{especially}} in [...] "Elevator Love Letter", saying: [...] "As good as they've been at amping up the romance crackling between Owen and Cristina, Kevin McKidd and Sandra Oh brought the Emmy consideration <b>tonight</b> <b>from</b> scene 1." [...] She also added: [...] "I loved seeing Cristina {{at least try}} to stand by her man." [...] Of Yang and Owen's wedding, Armstrong said: [...] "Glad we made a clean disposal of the Teddy-Owen-Cristina love triangle, though, when he quipped to Teddy, [...] "I heard there's a guy," [...] and she said she was happy for him." [...] She also praised Owen's proposal scene, giving it an [...] "A". Later, she praised their marriage, saying: [...] "I am absolutely loving the stronger-than-ever lady-bond between these two this season. Is it because they're both married now? Just growing up? Whatever, it's the opposite of Blair and Serena's annoyingly fickle frenemy status on Gossip Girl, and I can’t get enough." ...|$|E

2500|$|The German press jubilantly {{announced}} that [...] "one great {{cloud of smoke}} stretches <b>tonight</b> <b>from</b> the middle of London {{to the mouth of}} the Thames." [...] Reports reflected the briefings given to crews before the raids – [...] "Everyone knew about the last cowardly attacks on German cities, and thought about wives, mothers and children. And then came that word 'Vengeance!'" [...] Pilots reported seeing ruined airfields as they flew towards London, appearances which gave intelligence reports the impression of devastated defences. Göring maintained that the RAF was close to defeat, making invasion feasible.|$|E
2500|$|NBC {{announced}} in 2004 that Jay Leno would leave The Tonight Show in 2009, with Conan O'Brien as his replacement. Leno—who {{wanted to avoid}} an acrimonious transition like what he experienced when he inherited <b>Tonight</b> <b>from</b> Johnny Carson—said at the announcement, [...] "You can do these things until they carry you out on a stretcher, or {{you can get out}} when you’re still doing good." [...] He began to regret his decision to retire in 2007, and several networks and studios including ABC, Fox, Sony, and Tribune expressed interest in his services after leaving Tonight.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly afterwards, Dobbs {{announced}} that he would broadcast two episodes of Lou Dobbs <b>Tonight</b> <b>from</b> the [...] "Hold Their Feet to the Fire" [...] conference in Washington, D.C., organized by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), an anti-illegal immigration advocacy group. Media Matters also criticized this move, citing FAIR founder John Tanton's history of making racist remarks and supporting white supremacist organizations. Media Matters president, Eric Burns, issued an open letter to CNN vice president Jonathan Klein, asking that the network [...] [...] "Mr. Dobbs represents an ongoing threat to CNN's credibility as a serious news organization, in no small part because of his polemical coverage of immigration issues and his continued use of his CNN show to lend prominence to groups such as FAIR", wrote Burns. [...] "The attention and legitimacy he gave to the 'birther' movement—and CNN's condoning of his actions—did real damage to that credibility. His participation in the upcoming FAIR rally would do further, serious damage. We urge you to finally acknowledge that Mr. Dobbs' actions in this and other contexts are inconsistent with the reputation that CNN strives to maintain." ...|$|E
