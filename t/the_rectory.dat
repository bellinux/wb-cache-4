5|$|On 9 June, Pembroke left Gaveston at <b>the</b> <b>rectory</b> at Deddington in Oxfordshire, {{while he}} himself left {{to visit his}} wife. When Warwick found out about Gaveston's whereabouts, he {{immediately}} rode out to capture him.

Pembroke, whose honour had been affronted, appealed for justice both to Gaveston's brother-in-law Gloucester and to the University of Oxford, but to no avail. At Warwick, Gaveston was condemned to death for violating the terms of the Ordinances, before an assembly of barons, including Warwick, Lancaster, Hereford and Arundel. On 19 June, he was taken out on the road towards Kenilworth as far as Blacklow Hill, which was on the Earl of Lancaster's land. Here, two Welshmen ran him through with a sword and beheaded him.|$|E

5|$|The Lower Parsonage, {{attached}} to Chesham Woburn, stood immediately {{east of the}} church, between {{the church and the}} Old Town.
