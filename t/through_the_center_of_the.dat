5|$|Chambersburg's {{settlement}} {{began in}} 1730 when water mills were {{built at the}} confluence of Conococheague Creek and Falling Spring Creek that now run <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town. Its history includes episodes relating to the French and Indian War, the Whiskey Rebellion, John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, and the American Civil War. The borough was the only major northern community burned down by Confederate forces during the war.|$|E
5|$|In November 1883, the Oregon and California Railroad {{was built}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rogue Valley, {{bypassing}} Jacksonville, the county seat. The railroad company also constructed a train depot halfway between Central Point and Phoenix, and platted 82 city blocks around it. The townsite was named Medford in December. In 1884, residents celebrated the town's first Independence Day by firing 38 cannon blasts—one for each U.S. state—from Roxy Ann Peak's summit. Medford grew quickly, and was incorporated on February 24, 1885.|$|E

5|$|U.S. Route 50 (US-50) in Utah {{crosses the}} center of the state. The highway serves no major {{population}} centers in Utah, with the largest city along its path being Delta. Most of the route passes through desolate, remote areas. Through the eastern half of the state the route is concurrent with Interstate 70 (I-70). US-50 both enters and exits Utah concurrent with US-6, however the two routes are separate <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state.|$|E
5|$|A {{topographic}} map {{shows that the}} majority of the interconnected complex of tightly packed lakes with their valley-and-ridge landscape is primarily in Minnesota; the border of the landscape is the Canada–US border. This border is composed of the Pigeon River, and these Rove Formation lakes (going east to west): South Fowl, North Fowl, Moose, Mountain, Watap, Rose, South, Little North and Gunflint. The border runs approximately <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lengths of these lakes. The only Rove-typical east-west oriented lakes lying in Ontario are Arrow and North lakes.|$|E
5|$|East of the mall, {{the route}} passes through {{increasingly}} rural areas, {{with the exception}} of the hamlet of Egypt midway between NY250 and the Wayne County line. NY31 progresses onward into Wayne County, where the Rochester suburbs end as the route heads eastward through the mostly rural town of Macedon to the village of the same name. Prior to exiting the village, NY31 meets the southern terminus of NY350 and the eastern terminus of NY31F. The highway continues on, exiting the village and proceeding eastward through the town of Macedon, bordered by the Erie Canal to the north and Ganargua Creek to the south. In Palmyra, NY31 joins NY21 <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village.|$|E

The {{southern}} terminus of I-805 at I-5 in San Ysidro is less than a mile north of the Mexican border. I-805 then traverses the cities of Chula Vista and National City before reentering San Diego. The freeway passes though the San Diego neighborhoods of North Park, Mission Valley, Clairemont, and University City before terminating at I-5 in the Sorrento Valley neighborhood near the Del Mar city limit.|$|E
5|$|NY410 {{begins at}} a rural {{intersection}} with NY26 {{in the town}} of Denmark. The two-lane route heads eastward from the junction, winding to the north and south across open, rolling terrain with several cultivated fields. After , the highway meets County Route19 (CR19, named East Road) and turns to the northeast toward the village of Castorland. The open fields gradually give way to homes as NY410 enters the village limits as Main Street. The route passes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village, serving four lightly developed residential blocks before crossing the Mohawk, Adirondack and Northern Railroad at the northeastern edge of the community. At the rail crossing, the highway passes south of what was once the New York Central Railroad's Castorland passenger station.|$|E

5|$|New York State Route252 (NY252) is an east–west {{state highway}} south of Rochester in Monroe County, New York, in the United States. The western {{terminus}} {{of the route}} is at an intersection with NY33A in Chili and the eastern terminus is at a junction with NY64 and NY96 {{in the village of}} Pittsford. NY252 passes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town of Henrietta's commercial district, where it intersects NY15. The route passes through three distinct areas: a lightly populated, rural area of Chili west of the Genesee River, the heavily developed commercial district centered on NY252's intersections with NY15 and NY15A, and a mostly residential area of the town of Pittsford.|$|E
5|$|SR 139 runs {{northwest}} and north over mostly flat terrain <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national forest and {{the communities of}} Ambrose and Perez before turning northwest. The route continues through Copic, Newell, Stronghold, Homestead, and Tuber before cutting across the intermittent Tule Lake as the Lava Beds Highway through the city of Tulelake. During this segment, SR 139 passes directly through the former Tule Lake Segregation Unit, used to house Japanese-Americans during WWII. After passing through the former internment camp, SR 139 continues to the Oregon state line at Hatfield. At an intersection right on the state line, SR 161 begins to the west, and Oregon Route 39 continues northwest towards Klamath Falls.|$|E
5|$|The global {{definition}} of the Earth's field {{is based on a}} mathematical model. If a line is drawn <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth, parallel to the moment of the best-fitting magnetic dipole, the two positions where it intersects the Earth's surface are called the North and South geomagnetic poles. If the Earth's magnetic field were perfectly dipolar, the geomagnetic poles and magnetic dip poles would coincide and compasses would point towards them. However, the Earth's field has a significant non-dipolar contribution, so the poles do not coincide and compasses do not generally point at either.|$|E

5|$|The natural {{terrain of}} the area has been {{modified}} in the urban core of the city by grading, but maintains its gentle rolling character in the outlying areas. Numerous small creeks are found throughout the city and small lakes and woodlands lie in {{the northern and southern}} portions of the city. Sowashee Creek runs through the southern portion of the city and branches off into Gallagher's Creek, which flows <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city. Loper's Creek runs through the far-western part of the city while smaller creeks including Shearer's Branch, Magnolia Creek, and Robbins Creek are dispersed throughout the city.|$|E
5|$|The route {{proceeds}} west {{into the}} town of Owasco and the hamlet {{of the same name}} within, the first community of any significant size along the route since it left Moravia. It heads westward <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> community before reentering rural surroundings and coming within view of Owasco Lake. The route curves northward at the waterbody and follows the eastern shore of Owasco Lake toward Auburn. Southeast of Auburn, NY38A crosses a small stream and serves the Lakeview Golf and Country Club and the Owasco Country Club as it curves westward around the northern end of the lake.|$|E
5|$|NY5 {{enters the}} city of Utica on a {{concurrency}} with NY12 heading in a northeast direction. It shortly picks up NY8, and all three cross the city together. NY5 also intersects with the terminus of NY840 at this point. Just south of the New York State Thruway, I-790 begins as a short expressway, also including NY5, NY8, and NY12. After crossing out of the city, they meet the Thruway, with NY8 and12 continuing northeast, while I-790 and NY5 turn to the east-south-east, picking up the tail-end of NY49. These three, still as an expressway, straddle {{each side of the}} Thruway for a short way, with I-790 technically ending at the ramps for I-90. NY5 continues {{to the end of the}} expressway, only a few hundred feet later, dropping to Leland Avenue. A few hundred feet to the north of the Thruway, NY5 turns eastward again to continue down Herkimer Road. It closely parallels the Thruway all the way to Herkimer, where NY5 moves slightly northward <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village, becoming State Street, while I-90 crosses the Erie Canal and goes south for a short distance.

5|$|The tornado became violent as {{it entered}} Cullman, being tracked and {{broadcast}} live via several tower cameras, including one operated by ABC 33/40 for several minutes; that camera captured {{the destruction of}} a communications tower belonging to Cullman area low-power television station WCQT-LP as the tornado ripped through the city. Radio stations in downtown Cullman also reported on the tornado and some even captured it passing over until power was knocked out. Downtown Cullman was badly damaged by the tornado, with the major damage being along a two-block area <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> downtown business district. Numerous well-built brick buildings and storefronts in downtown Cullman were heavily damaged or completely destroyed, along with multiple churches. The courthouse and nearby emergency management building took a direct hit from the tornado, sustaining considerable damage, and two school buildings were heavily damaged as well. Many well-known businesses, such as Vincent's Furniture, The Cullman Times, and the Busy Bee Cafe, were also severely damaged/destroyed. Many homes were damaged or destroyed in residential areas of the city, with extensive tree and power line damage noted as well. In all, a total of 867 residences and 94 businesses within the city of Cullman were damaged or destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Fort Donelson {{was named}} for Brig. Gen. Daniel S. Donelson, who {{selected}} its site and began construction in 1861. It was considerably more formidable than Fort Henry. Fort Donelson rose about 100 feet (30m) on approximately 100 acres of dry ground above the Cumberland River, which allowed for plunging fire against attacking gunboats, an advantage Fort Henry did not enjoy. The river batteries included twelve guns: ten 32-pounder smoothbore cannons, two 9-pounder smoothbore cannons, a 8-inch howitzer, a 6.5-inch rifle (128-pounder), and a 10-inch Columbiad. There were three miles (5km) of trenches in a semicircle around the fort and {{the small town of}} Dover. The outer works were bounded by Hickman Creek to the west, Lick Creek to the east, and the Cumberland River to the north. These trenches, located on a commanding ridge and fronted by a dense abatis of cut trees and limbs stuck into the ground and pointing outward, were backed up by artillery and manned by Buckner and his Bowling Green troops on the right (with his flank anchored on Hickman Creek), and Johnson/Pillow on the left (with his flank near the Cumberland River). Facing the Confederates, from left to right, were Smith, Lew Wallace (who arrived on February 14), and McClernand. McClernand's right flank, which faced Pillow, had insufficient men to reach overflowing Lick Creek, so it was left unanchored. <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Confederate line ran the marshy Indian Creek, this point defended primarily by artillery overlooking it on each side.|$|E
