5|$|After the military, {{the second}} largest and most {{important}} industry for Hampton Roads and Norfolk based on economic impact are the region's cargo ports. Headquartered in Norfolk, the Virginia Port Authority (VPA) is a Commonwealth of Virginia owned-entity that, in turn, owns and operates three major port facilities in Hampton Roads for break-bulk and container type cargo. In Norfolk, Norfolk International Terminals (NIT) represents one of <b>those</b> <b>three</b> facilities and {{is home to the}} world's largest and fastest container cranes. Together, the three terminals of the VPA handled a total of over 2 million TEUs and 475,000 tons of breakbulk cargo in 2006, making it the second busiest port on the east coast of North America by total cargo volume after the Port of New York and New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the 2006 season, Sanchez competed for the {{starting}} quarterback position; once Booty, a junior, suffered severe back spasms caused by a pre-existing back condition, surgery was required and Sanchez was promoted to run the first-team offense during the spring as Booty recovered. Coaches stated Booty would be considered the starting quarterback when he returned for fall practice. During the 2006 season, Sanchez saw limited playing time in games against Arkansas, Stanford and Oregon. Through <b>those</b> <b>three</b> games, Sanchez completed 3 of his 7 pass attempts for 63 yards and one interception. He also saw additional action against Arizona, Michigan, and Notre Dame but he did not attempt a pass in those contests.|$|E

Quarterback Manuel completed two of <b>those</b> <b>three</b> pass attempts, gaining 37 yards and advancing deep into Virginia Tech territory. A pass interference penalty against Virginia Tech advanced the Seminoles to the Tech 11-yard line, and three rushing plays later, running back Ty Jones crossed the goal line for a touchdown.

5|$|French {{casualties}} {{are hard}} to calculate, as the best available source is the vague totals submitted by Duckworth in his account to the Admiralty. He estimates, apparently based on reports by the senior remaining French officers on Alexandre, Jupiter and Brave, that <b>those</b> <b>three</b> ships suffered 760 casualties in total. These accounts were subsequently called into question by historian William James, who considered them too high. James also criticised the assumed totals for Impérial and Diomède, which are even less certain but reportedly totalled 500 and 250 respectively. In addition to those killed and wounded, the entire surviving crews of Alexandre, Jupiter and Brave were taken prisoner, as were 150 men from Diomède and six from Impérial seized by British boarding parties on 8 February.|$|E

5|$|More recently, Gavin Naylor's 1992 phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} {{allozyme}} sequence data, {{found that the}} silky shark {{is part of a}} group containing large sharks with a ridge between the dorsal fins.

5|$|The 1930 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the second}} least active Atlantic {{hurricane season}} on record – behind only 1914 – with only three systems reaching tropical storm intensity. Of <b>those</b> <b>three,</b> two reached hurricane status, both of which also became major hurricanes, Category3 or higher storms on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The first system developed in the central Atlantic Ocean on August21. Later that month, a second storm, the Dominican Republic hurricane, formed on August29. It peaked as a Category4 hurricane with winds of 155mph (250km/h). The third and final storm dissipated on October21.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic {{hurricane}} season officially began on June1, and an unnamed subtropical storm developed {{on the same}} day. 1997 was the least active {{hurricane season}} in above average era of tropical cyclogenesis, which began in 1995.

There was only one tropical cyclone to reach major hurricane status, which was slightly below the 1950–2005 average of two per season. Only Danny made landfall at hurricane strength during the season, although Hurricane Erika and Tropical Storm Grace also caused damage and fatalities. <b>Those</b> <b>three</b> cyclones collectively caused 11deaths and $111.46million in damage.

5|$|The First Partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth {{took place}} in 1772 as {{the first of three}} {{partitions}} that ended the existence of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth by 1795. Growth in the Russian Empire's power, threatening the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg Austrian Empire, was the primary motive behind this first partition. Frederick the Great engineered the partition to prevent Austria, jealous of Russian successes against the Ottoman Empire, from going to war. The weakened Commonwealth's land, including what was already controlled by Russia, was apportioned among its more powerful neighbors—Austria, Russia and Prussia—so as to restore the regional balance of power in Central Europe among <b>those</b> <b>three</b> countries. With Poland unable to effectively defend itself, and with foreign troops already inside the country, the Polish parliament (Sejm) ratified the partition in 1773 during the Partition Sejm convened by the three powers.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the copper shark as Near Threatened worldwide. While the global population is unknown, the long maturation time and low reproductive rate {{of this species}} render it highly susceptible to overfishing.

Reported catches by New Zealand have steadily declined {{from a peak of}} 40 tons in 1995/96 to 20 tons 2001/02, though it is uncertain whether this reflects a genuine decline or changing fishing habits.|$|E
