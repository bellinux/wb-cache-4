50|$|The {{original}} books seem to {{have been}} bought in Cambridge, since there are some second-hand volumes whose provenance has been traced to that town and a number whose bindings have been linked to Cambridge binders of the 16th century. One of them, Garrett Godfrey, used his initials in the design he often stamped on the leather; another was Thomas Thomas, a binder who later became printer to the university. He probably added two of the books, which have <b>Trigge's</b> signature in a neat italic hand, at the time. Twenty volumes were added to the library from his own books under the terms of his will when he died in 1606.|$|R
2500|$|Grantham has {{a variety}} of churches of {{different}} denominations. The main local landmark is the parish church of St Wulfram's, which has the sixth highest spire among English churches at [...] It is the second tallest church in Lincolnshire, after St James' Church in Louth. It is also home to England's first public library, dating from 1598, when Francis <b>Trigge,</b> rector of Welbourn, gave £100 for a small chained library of books for the clergy and literate laity of Grantham. Two hundred and fifty of the original volumes remain and are kept in a small room above the South Porch. From October 1974 the church was permanently floodlit at night.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 August 1799, a British force {{under the}} command of Lieutenant-General Thomas <b>Trigge</b> and Vice Admiral the Right Honourable Lord Hugh Seymour {{captured}} the Dutch colony of Suriname. Among the various items of booty was the French corvette Hussar. [...] The American ships [...] (24) and [...] (12), searching for French vessels that had been preying on American merchantmen, had blockaded Hussar for two months in the Suriname River. Eventually, Hussar surrendered to the Americans, who removed her crew. Shortly thereafter the British arrived and captured Suriname. The Americans agreed that the British had rights to Hussar herself as she had been in inland waters upon the surrender of Suriname. (The British also captured the Dutch brig-sloop Kemphaan, which they took into service under the name Camphaan.) The letter reporting the corvette's capture describes her as [...] "The French Corvette L'Hussar, a very fine Vessel, only Seven Months old; mounts Twenty Nine-Pounders". The British renamed her Surinam and Lieutenant Christopher Cole, of [...] was appointed to command her.|$|E

500|$|With {{the end of}} the war Eyre {{returned}} to England with King aboard , but soon rejoined the Resistance and went out to Halifax to join Sir Charles Douglas. As Douglas' flagship spent most of her time in port, Eyre was sent out to cruise on other ships, including [...] under Captain Stanhope, and [...] under Captain Thomas Foley. Eyre {{returned to}} Britain with Resistance in 1786, and the following year joined the 44-gun [...] under Captain Francis Parry. Parry went out as commodore to Guinea, but ill-health obliged him to resign his command, and Eyre went to Newfoundland aboard Captain <b>Trigge's</b> [...] Eyre joined Admiral Lord Howe's flagship [...] during the Spanish Armament, and in November 1790 was promoted to lieutenant. He then joined [...] under Captain Edward Thornbrough, and after Scipio was paid off, [...] under Captain Robert Stopford, in which he sailed to the Mediterranean.|$|R
30|$|Another {{prominent}} {{feature in}} CBIR is texture. Variance and mean {{values of the}} wavelet coefficients {{have been used to}} describe texture features in image retrieval by Smith and Chang (1996). Ahmadian and Mostafa (2003) devised the wavelet transform to classify the texture. Subrahmanyam et al. (2011) modified the concept of correlogram using wavelets and rotated wavelets (WC + RWC). A spatial computation method called local binary pattern (LBP) was introduced by Ojala et al. (1996) and later local binary patterns have been enhanced for rotational invariant texture classification (Ojala et al. 2002). Pietikainen et al. (2000) proposed the rotational invariant texture classification using feature distributions. Zhao and Pietikainen (2007) applied LBP in face recognition and analysis. Heikkil and Pietikainen (2006) used LBP for background modeling and detection by using LBP. Li and Staunton (2008) proposed a combination of LBP and Gabor filter for texture segmentation. By considering LBP as a non-directional 1 st order spatial pattern, Zhang et al. (2010) presented local derivative pattern for face recognition areas. A modified version of LBP called center-symmetric LBP, combined with scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) has been used to describe interest region in Heikkil et al. (2009). An extension of LBP concept based on edge responses named Local directional pattern was proposed by Jabid et al. (2010). Subrahmanyam et al. (2012) designed different types of spatial pattern based feature descriptors, local tetra patterns (LTrP) local maximum edge patterns (LMEBP) (Subrahmanyam et al. 2012), directional local extrema patterns (DLEP) (Subrahmanyam et al. 2012) for natural or texture image retrieval. Directional binary wavelet patterns (DBWP) (Subrahmanyam et al. 2012), local mesh patterns (LMeP) (Subrahmanyam and Wu 2014) and local ternary co-occurrence patterns (LTCoP) (Subrahmanyam and Wu 2013) for biomedical image retrieval. Reddy and Reddy (2014) added magnitude information to DLEP to enhance the performance of retrieval system. To address few issues of LBP, Hussain and <b>trigges</b> (2012) introduced local quantized patterns (LQP) for visual recognition. Verma et al. (2015) proposed an integrated approach based on local patterns to natural, biomedical images (Koteswara Rao and Venkata Rao 2015). Vipparthi et al. integrated Local patterns and Gabor feature to propose a feature descriptor (Verma et al. 2015).|$|R
30|$|Texture {{is another}} {{important}} feature for CBIR. Smith et al. used the mean and variance of the wavelet coefficients as texture features for CBIR [15]. Moghaddam et al. proposed the Gabor wavelet correlogram (GWC) for CBIR [16]. Ahmadian et al. used the wavelet transform for texture classification [17]. Subrahmanyam et al. have proposed the correlogram algorithm for image retrieval using wavelets and rotated wavelets (WC + RWC) [18]. Ojala et al. proposed the local binary pattern (LBP) features for texture description [19] and these LBPs are converted to rotational invariant LBP for texture classification [20]. Pietikainen et al. proposed the rotational invariant texture classification using feature distributions [21]. Ahonen et al. [22] and Zhao et al. [23] used the LBP operator facial expression analysis and recognition. Heikkila et al. proposed the background modeling and detection by using LBP [24]. Huang et al. proposed the extended LBP for shape localization [25]. Heikkila et al. used the LBP for interest region description [26]. Li et al. used the combination of Gabor filter and LBP for texture segmentation [27]. Zhang et al. proposed the local derivative pattern for face recognition [28]. They have considered LBP as a nondirectional first order local pattern, which are the binary results of the first-order derivative in images. The block-based texture feature which use the LBP texture feature {{as the source of}} image description is proposed in [29] for CBIR. The center-symmetric local binary pattern (CS-LBP) which is {{a modified version of the}} well-known LBP feature is combined with scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) in [30] to describe the regions of interest. Yao et al. [31] have proposed two types of local edge patterns (LEP) histograms, one is LEPSEG for image segmentation, and the other is LEPINV for image retrieval. The LEPSEG is sensitive to variations in rotation and scale, on the contrary, the LEPINV is resistant to variations in rotation and scale. The local ternary pattern (LTP) [32] has been introduced for face recognition under different lighting conditions. Subrahmanyam et al. have proposed various pattern based features such as local maximum edge patterns (LMEBP) [33], local tetra patterns (LTrP) [34] and directional local extrema patterns (DLEP) [35] for natural/texture image retrieval and directional binary wavelet patterns (DBWP) [36], local mesh patterns (LMeP) [37] and local ternary co-occurance patterns (LTCoP) [38] for biomedical image retrieval. Reddy et al. [39] have extended the DLEP features by adding the magnitude information of the local gray values of an image. Hussain and <b>trigges</b> [40] have proposed the local quantized patterns (LQP) for visual recognition.|$|R
