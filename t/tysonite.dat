Strong near-infrared luminescence, peaked at 1. 54 mym, was observed from such films under electron beam excitation. This cathodoluminescence arises from the intra- 4 f-shell transitions.

Investigations of chemical interactions indicate the formation of Sisingle bondHo bonds and suggest the creation of a volatile fluoride.

40|$|The {{structure}} of BaThF(6) {{has been investigated}} {{as a function of}} temperature and pressure with single-crystal X-ray diffraction using synchrotron radiation. The compound crystallizes in the <b>tysonite</b> structure, space group P 6 (3) /mmc (a = 4. 296 (1) Å and c = 7. 571 (1) Å at ambient conditions). It is stable at least down to 150 K and up to 4 GPa. In the entire range of pressures and temperatures studied here, the compound is characterized by a high degree of disorder, both on the cationic and anionic positions. Despite the different valence states and sizes, both cations occupy the same crystallographic site in the ideal <b>tysonite</b> structure. The cationic disorder is described by two alternative approaches. The first model corresponds to a split-atom position model in which Ba(2 +) is maintained on a special position with site symmetry 6 m 2, while Th(4 +) is slightly displaced from the respective position. In the second model, both cations are maintained on the ideal position and anharmonic displacement parameters using a tensor of third order are introduced. Anharmonic displacement parameters have been refined from high-pressure single-crystal X-ray data measured in situ in a diamond anvil cell for the first time. The feasibility and general problems of anharmonic refinements of high-pressure X-ray data are further commented...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePure <b>tysonite</b> Sm 1 –xCaxF 3 –x solid {{solutions}} for 0. 05 ≤ x ≤ 0. 17 {{have been prepared}} by the solid-state route. For the first time, the partial Sm 1 –xCaxF 3 –x solid solution is investigated {{on the basis of}} structural features and ionic conductivity measurements. Powder X-ray diffraction Rietveld refinements show an unexpected decrease of the hexagonal unit cell volume related to the creation of fluorine vacancies. The local environment of F 1, which is mainly responsible for the ionic conductivity, changes with the Ca content: the distortion of the F 1 (Sm,Ca) 4 tetrahedral site decreases with the Ca content. Fluoride ion exchanges have been qualitatively probed on two Sm 1 –xCaxF 3 –x (x = 0. 05 and x = 0. 15) samples thanks to 19 F magic angle spinning NMR experiments at various spinning frequencies and temperatures. At room temperature, the ionic conductivity decreases exponentially with the Ca content and the activation energy increases monotonously with the Ca content. The highest conductivity is found for the lowest Ca content or the smallest fluorine vacancy content stabilized in the Sm 1 –xCaxF 3 –x <b>tysonite</b> network corresponding to Sm 0. 95 Ca 0. 05 F 2. 95 (10 – 4 S·cm– 1, Ea = 0. 36 eV at room temperature). For this composition, the largest dispersions of F 2 –(Sm,Ca) and F 3 –(Sm,Ca) distances as well as (Sm,Ca) –F 1 –(Sm,Ca) angles are observed. The buckling of F 2 /F 3 sheets around the z = 1 / 4 coordinate for low Ca content affects the large F 1 tetrahedral site with the strongest distortion. The higher the buckling effect into the F 2 /F 3 sheets, the higher the F 1 local site distortion and the higher the ionic mobility and conductivity...|$|E

The nanocrystalline powders are studied by X-ray and TEM analyses and by 19 F solid state NMR and impedance spectroscopies.

Fluorine environments and mobilities are discussed {{on the basis of}} 19 F solid state NMR data, both prior and after thermal treatment. The ionic conductivity, evaluated from sintered pellets, is compared at different thermal treatment temperatures.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of twinning {{can often be}} related to higher symmetrical structures. Fluorides are frequently twinned due to their close relation to high symmetry structures like fluoride, <b>tysonite</b> or pyrochlores. The series of compounds CsLn$_ 2 $F$_ 7 $ is no exception. We refined the structures of the twinned compounds with Ln=Nd, Gd, Tb, Er, Yb in space group P 112 $_ 1 $/b.

Several other compounds ALn$_ 2 $F$_ 7 $, which have been described in the literature, show a similar cation array. The diversity of different space groups which have been reported for ALn$_ 2 $F$_ 7 $ compounds can be better understood using group-subgroup relationships assuming the hypothetical structure of the cation array with space group P 6 $_ 3 $/mmc as aristotype. Furthermore, the twinning is easily understood {{on the basis of the}} lost symmetry operations in the symmetry reduction from point group 6 /mmm, e. g. to 2 /m in the case of the CsLn$_ 2 $F$_ 7 $ compounds...|$|E

The absorption band at 3. 75 eV with half width of 1. 1 eV is observed in X-irradiated LaF 3, {{similar to the}} Vk-centre-bands observed in other fluorides. No such band is observed in X-irradiated CeF 3. In additively colored CeF 3 absorption bands at 1. 7 eV, 2. 15 eV are observed. These bands {{can be attributed to}} F centres. Additive coloration upon heating in calcium vapor did not produce any new absorption band in LaF 3 crystals while formation of metallic inclusions, most likely La precipitates were observed.
