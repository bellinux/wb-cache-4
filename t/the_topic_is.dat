5|$|The text of {{the short}} work was written by Georg Christian Lehms, for two arias and a {{connecting}} recitative. <b>The</b> <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> to resist sin, based on the Epistle of James. The text was published in a 1711 collection, dedicated to the Sunday Oculi. It is not known when Bach composed the work but is assumed that he performed {{it as part of}} his monthly cantata productions in 1714 on the seventh Sunday after Trinity, 15 July. The solo voice is accompanied by strings: two violin parts, two viola parts and continuo. The composition begins with a striking dissonant chord.|$|E
5|$|While English is a subject-prominent language, at the {{discourse}} level {{it tends to}} use a topic-comment structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally {{has to be the}} grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> not the grammatical subject of the sentence, frequently <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, the girl was stung by the bee. Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there, e.g. it was the girl that the bee stung, there was a girl who was stung by a bee. Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., it is raining) or in existential clauses (there are many cars on the street). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.|$|E
5|$|Tanasescu {{explores the}} idea of rights for nature, an idea which, though unorthodox, has seen success in implementation. He first {{introduces}} the concept, {{with a focus on}} the differences between moral and legal rights, before examining the particular case of Ecuador's entrenchment of rights for nature in its 2008 constitution, which is compared with other real-world cases. He finally addresses what can be learnt from these theoretical and practical considerations. He concludes that much work on <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> left to be done, but the key lesson to be learnt is the significance of innovation; environmental politics, he claims, should remain both inventive and optimistic.

5|$|The changes seen {{in series}} VII were {{seen by some}} as a disappointment; while much slicker and higher-budget in appearance, the shift away from {{outright}} sitcom and into something approaching comedy drama was seen as a move in the wrong direction. Furthermore, the attempt to shift back into traditional sitcom format for series VIII was greeted with a response that was similarly lukewarm. There was criticism aimed at the decision to resurrect the entire crew of Red Dwarf, as it was felt this detracted from the series' central premise of Lister being the last human being alive. There are other critics who feel that series VII and VIII are no weaker than the earlier series, however, and <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> the subject of constant fervent debate among the show's fanbase.|$|E
5|$|The {{decline in}} {{amphibian}} populations {{is an ongoing}} mass extinction of amphibian species worldwide. Since the 1980s, decreases in amphibian populations, including population crashes and mass localized extinctions, have been observed in locations all over the world. These declines are {{known as one of}} the most critical threats to global biodiversity, and several causes are believed to be involved, including disease, habitat destruction and modification, exploitation, pollution, pesticide use, introduced species, and ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B). However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> currently a subject of much ongoing research. Calculations based on extinction rates suggest that the current extinction rate of amphibians could be 211 times greater than the background extinction rate and the estimate goes up to 25,000–45,000 times if endangered species are also included in the computation.|$|E

50|$|In {{traditional}} BBS, <b>the</b> <b>topics</b> <b>are</b> usually broadly covered, {{which may}} contain {{a wide range}} of information. For example, in traditional BBS, 'Singer' can <b>be</b> a <b>topic.</b> However, in Tieba, <b>the</b> <b>topics</b> <b>are</b> actually very specific: a <b>topic</b> can <b>be</b> a pop star's name, an online game, and even your own name.

25|$|Offending {{content is}} usually deleted. Sometimes if <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} {{the source of}} the problem, it is locked; often a poster may request a topic expected to draw problems to be locked as well, although the moderators decide whether to grant it. In a locked thread, members cannot post anymore. In cases where <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> considered a breach of rules it – with all of its posts – may be deleted.|$|E

25|$|Cognitive load is an {{important}} predictor of formulaic language. More disfluency is found in longer utterances and when <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> unfamiliar.

25|$|There is {{much debate}} {{on the topic of}} {{euthanasia}} in Judaic theology, ethics, and general opinion (especially in Israel and the United States).
