40|$|Sugar beets (Beta vulgaris L.) {{and navy}} beans (Phaseoulus vulgaris L.) have been {{important}} target crops in the crop rotation systems of many Michigan growers, particularly in the Saginaw Valley and the Thumb region. The recent decline in sugar beet yields combined with the erratic navy bean yields have led to concern about the optimal crop rotation for the East Central region in Michigan. Risk is an important consideration in a farmer's choice of cropping systems. This study uses 20 years of experimental data from the Michigan State University Saginaw Valley Research Farm to determine the risk efficiency of alternative sugar beet- and navy bean- based crop rotations that included corn (Zea mays L.), oats (Avena sativa L.), and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) as rotational crops. The crop rotations differed in rotation length and crop sequence. Stochastic dominance analysis showed that the two-year rotation of sugar beets followed by navy beans was first-degree stochastic (FSD) and second-degree dominant (SSD) over 11 other crop rotation alternatives. Crop rotations that included sugar beets in two-year rotations and both sugar beets and navy beans in <b>three-year</b> <b>rotations</b> were the next stochastic dominant systems.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesAfrica {{has been}} slow to respond to {{biotechnology}} even as its pest management grows increasingly obsolete and insects remain a major adversary of its farming. Opponents of biotechnology cite concerns over the scientific boundaries and potential North-South domination that transgenic crops could bring. This paper reports on the positive aspects of introducing biotechnology in Africa. An economic model was developed to predict the economic impacts to consumers and producers from the introduction of Bt crops in the smallholder cotton farms of Mali. Since farmers rotate cotton and maize in <b>three-year</b> <b>rotations,</b> the analysis considered the introduction of both Bt cotton and Bt maize. Results from an economic model indicate that the potential economic impacts to West African consumers and producers would be significant, potentially reaching $ 89 million in an average year. For Bt cotton, the benefits would primarily accrue to producers. At a technology premium of $ 60 per hectare, where seed company revenue is maximized, Malian producer would capture 74 % of the benefits and the seed company would capture the other 26 %. The model found that the adoption of Bt maize was weaker than Bt cotton. If Malian maize producers were charged the same technology premium as South African producers, the model found that adoption would be less than 10 %. The introduction of Bt maize in the region is likely to require complementary changes in maize markets and technology in order to boost profitability...|$|R

In this study the CERES-Wheat and CROPGRO-Tomato models {{were used to assess}} the effects of climate change on winter wheat (Triticum durum L.) and processing tomato (Lycopersicon aesculentum Mill.) in one of most productive areas of Italy, located {{in the northern part of}} the Puglia region. In particular we have compared three different General Circulation Models (HadCM 3, CCSM 3, ECHAM 5) subjected to a statistical downscaling under two future IPCC scenarios (B 1 and A 2). The analysis was carried out at regional scale repeating the simulations for seven homogeneous area characterizing the spatial variability of the region. In the second part of the study, considering only HadCM 3 data set, climate change impact on long-term sequences of the two crops combined in three crop rotations were evaluated in terms of yield performances and soil fertility as indicated by the soil organic content of carbon and nitrogen. The comparison between GCMs showed no significant differences for winter durum wheat yield, while noticeable differences were found for yield and irrigation requirements of tomato. Under future scenarios, the production levels were reduced for tomato, whereas positive yield effects were observed for winter durum wheat. For winter durum wheat the simulation indicated that two- and <b>three-year</b> <b>rotations,</b> including one year of tomato cultivation, improved the cereal yield and this positive effect maintained its validity also in future scenarios.

40|$|Potato crops {{generally}} require high {{amounts of}} phosphorus (P) fertilizer to reach economically acceptable yields. However, high inputs of P not only increase production cost, but also {{may increase the}} environmental risk of P runoff. We evaluated soil test P and sequentially-extracted P in soil samples from 10 potato fields which had <b>three-year</b> crop <b>rotations</b> with or without irrigation. Whereas soil test (Olsen) P was not significantly influenced by crop rotation and irrigation, P levels in sequentially-extracted fractions were impacted by management. The impact of crop rotation was mainly expressed on water extractable P. Irrigation had greater influence on stable P extracted in NaOH and HCl fractions. Higher levels of NaOH extractable inorganic P were observed in soil from irrigated fields, while higher levels of HCl extractable P were observed insoils under rainfed management. Our data indicate that crop management practice may eventually affect P availability and runoff potential in these potato soils over the long term. However, more field data from longer experimental periods are needed to confirm this hypothesis...|$|R

50|$|Peanuts grow best in light, {{sandy loam}} soil with a pH of 5.9-7. Their {{capacity}} to fix nitrogen means that, providing they nodulate properly, peanuts benefit little {{or not at}} all from nitrogen-containing fertilizer, and they improve soil fertility. Therefore, they are valuable in crop rotations. Also, the yield of the peanut crop itself is increased in rotations, through reduced diseases, pests and weeds. For instance, in Texas, peanuts in a <b>three-year</b> <b>rotation</b> with corn yield 50% more than nonrotated peanuts. Adequate levels of phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and micronutrients are also necessary for good yields. To develop well, peanuts need warm weather throughout the growing season. They can be grown with as little as 350 mm of water, but for best yields need at least 500 mm. Depending on growing conditions and the cultivar of peanut, harvest is usually 90 to 130 days after planting for subspecies A. h. fastigiata types, and 120 to 150 days after planting for subspecies A. h. hypogaea types. Subspecies A. h. hypogaea types yield more, and are usually preferred where the growing seasons are long enough.|$|E

40|$|This work {{is aimed}} at demonstrating the {{advantages}} of on-field oil extraction and protein cake exploitation from biomasses produced by a <b>three-years</b> crop <b>rotation.</b> The rotation that has been taken into account is rapeseed-sunflowerflax, suitable for most Mediterranean climatic zones. The process is divided in differents phases: extraction of pure vegetable oil (PVO) from seeds, gasification of the protein cake remaining from oil extraction and trans-esterification of the PVO using the methanol obtained by conversion of part of the syngas from gasification. In this way, instead of selling the seeds to the market, {{it is possible to}} sell the biodiesel and the electrical energy obtained from an IC engine operating with the excess of syngas. The effectiveness evaluation of this approach has been obtained through energetic and economical modeling of the whole system. The system has been simulated using ASPEN PLUSTM and MATLABTM codes. The results show the advantages related to the installation of micro power plants of 10 kWel, involving little surfaces tilled.

In a long-term experiment a conventional system, characterized by traditional agricultural practices (as deep tillage and chemical input) was compared with an organic one, including minimum tillage, green manure and organic fertilizers. Both systems have a <b>three-year</b> crop <b>rotation</b> including pea – durum wheat – tomato; the organic system is implemented {{with the introduction of}} common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) and sorghum (Sorghum vulgare bicolor) as cover crops. In the year 2006 (5 years after the experimentation beginning) was determined the soil C content and was measured the CO 2 emissions from soil. The first results showed a trend of CO 2 production higher in organic soils in comparison with conventional one. Among the two compared cropping systems the higher differences of CO 2 emission were observed in tomato soil respect to the durum wheat and pea soils, probably due to the vetch green manuring before the tomato transplanting. These results are in agreement with the total organic carbon content and water soluble carbon (WSC), which showed the highest values in organic soil. The first observations suggest a higher biological activity and CO 2 emission in organic soil than conventional one, likely due to a higher total carbon soil content...|$|R
