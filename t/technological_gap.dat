In the 1960s and early 1970s, to counter the increasing insurgency of FRELIMO forces and show to the Portuguese people and the world that the territory was totally under control, the Portuguese government accelerated its major development program to expand and upgrade the infrastructure of Portuguese Mozambique by creating new roads, railways, bridges, dams, irrigation systems, schools and hospitals to stimulate an even higher level of economic growth and support from the populace.|$|E
5|$|STRAT-X, or Strategic-Experimental, was a U.S. government-sponsored study {{conducted}} during 1966 and 1967 that comprehensively analyzed the potential {{future of the}} U.S. nuclear deterrent force. At the time, the Soviet Union was making significant strides in nuclear weapons delivery, and also constructing anti-ballistic missile defenses to protect strategic facilities. To address a potential <b>technological</b> <b>gap</b> between the two superpowers, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara entrusted the classified STRAT-X study to the Institute for Defense Analyses, which compiled a twenty-volume report in nine months. The report looked into {{more than one hundred}} different weapons systems, ultimately resulting in the MGM-134 Midgetman and LGM-118 Peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missiles, the s, and the Trident submarine-launched ballistic missiles, among others. Journalists have regarded STRAT-X as a major influence on the course of U.S. nuclear policy.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{over the}} sale of the Su-35 proved {{protracted}} due to concerns over intellectual property rights. Since China had reverse engineered the Su-27SK and Su-33 to create the J-11B and J-15, respectively, there were concerns that China would copy the airframe and offer the copied design on the export market. At one stage Rosoboronexport demanded that China provided a legally-binding guarantee against copying. However, industry sources believed that Chinese industry was interested in the AL-41FS1 engine and Irbis-E radar. According to The Diplomat, China was specifically interested in the engine of the Su-35, as the country was already test flying the J-11D. While the aircraft reportedly has less range, payload and manoeuvrability than the Su-35, the J-11D has an active electronically-scanned array radar, instead of the less-advanced PESA radar as found on the Su-35. Various reports have drawn attention to the need for Chinese industry to close the <b>technological</b> <b>gap</b> between its engine industry and those of the US, Europe and Russia.|$|E

During the period of slavery, the populations of Europe and the Americas grew exponentially, while the population of Africa remained stagnant. Rodney contended that the profits from slavery were used to fund economic growth and technological advancement in Europe and the Americas. Based on earlier theories by Eric Williams, he asserted that the industrial revolution was at least in part funded by agricultural profits from the Americas. He cited examples such as the invention of the steam engine by James Watt, which was funded by plantation owners from the Caribbean.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the relation between}} the quality and quantity indicators of physical capital and modernisation. While international academic literature emphasises the role of intangible factors enabling technology generation and absorption rather than that of physical capital accumulation, this paper argues that {{the quantity and quality of}} physical capital are important modernisation factors, particularly in the case of small, undercapitalised countries that recently integrated into the world economy. The paper shows that in Hungary, as opposed to developed countries, the technological upgrading of capital assets was not necessarily accompanied by the upgrading of human capital i. e. the thesis of capital skill complementarity did not apply to the first decade of transformation and capital accumulation in Hungary. Finally, the paper shows that there are large differences between the average technological levels of individual industries. The dualism of the Hungarian economy, which is also manifest in terms of differences in the size of individual industries' <b>technological</b> <b>gaps,</b> is a disadvantage from the point of view of competitiveness. The increasing differences in the size of the <b>technological</b> <b>gaps</b> can be explained not only with industry-specific factors, but also with the weakness of technology and regional development policies, as well as with institutional deficiencies...|$|R

The main catalyst behind this study is attempting to answer the question of why PC sales have shrunk recently. We started conducting our research by applying the macroeconomics forces at the macro scale to have a clear vision of the exerted forces on PC industry—namely the impact of tablets, Ultrabook, laptops, and smartphones on PCs. Accordingly, we conducted an intensive literature review followed by a survey to understand the trends of PC industry as well as the end users’ needs. Based on the knowledge extracted from the literature and the survey, we constructed the Technology Roadmap of the next hybrid PC generations.

Data collected through individual interview using semi-structured questioner and field observation, and analyzed using SPSS statistical software version 15. Majority (91. 4 %) of the respondents had less than 21 year mango production experiences. Further, 54. 3 % of the respondents did not attend formal education. Only 1. 4 % of the respondents can do mango grafting. Majority of the respondents did not apply inorganic fertilizer, did not spray pesticides and fungicides to control pests and diseases, and did not prune their mango trees. These depict mango production knowledge and skill gaps of smallholder farmers. There is no site specific recommendation on irrigation interval, fertilizer rate, spacing, pruning season, scion and rootstock varieties, and insect pest and disease control methods for mango production. About 66 % of the mango trees of the respondents are developed from seedlings and need to be converted into improved varieties through top-working.

40|$|Bentonite-based {{materials}} (BBM) in {{the form}} of blocks or rings have been commonly proposed as buffer materials for high-level radioactive waste disposal. In a real repository, hydraulic fracturing is likely to be present when the ground water pressure exceeds to hydraulic resistance, the existence of <b>technological</b> <b>gaps</b> increases the risk of hydraulic fracturing. Based on the previous studies of hydraulic fracturing of BBM technological interfaces, the present work systematically analyzes the experimental achievements. Results show that the fracturing pressure of BBM interfaces increases with hydration time, initial dry density, bentonite content overburden pressure, while it decreases with initial water content gap thickness. The temperature effect on hydraulic fracturing depends on the predominant cation of bentonite. For Na-bentonite, the higher temperature leads to the larger swelling pressure, thus the stronger hydraulic resistance. Tensile failure, shear failure synthesis failures are increasingly accepted for hydraulic fracturing mechanism. The hydraulic fracturing of highly compacted BBM is mainly controlled by tensile failure, while the initial shear failure can be found for BBM with a low enough density. Since hydraulic fracturing is expected to occur several times during the repository operation, the long-time monitoring of hydro-mechanical behavior is of vital importance until the <b>technological</b> <b>gaps</b> are completely sealed. Furthermore, the failure mechanism of hydraulic fracturing of BBM should be further researched, as well as the sealing properties of interfaces under thermohydro-mechanically coupled conditions are proposed to be studied thoroughly...|$|R
