5|$|On August 2 {{as many as}} 3,000 {{troops of}} the Pennsylvania National Guard First Division arrived from Pittsburgh {{under the command of}} Major General Robert Brinton, and imposed martial law. The troops had arrested an {{estimated}} 70 activists en route, and forced those apprehended to repair places where <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks</b> between the cities had been destroyed.|$|E
5|$|After he is accosted by Doerachman, Mardjan {{reveals that}} the letter which Doerachman signed was {{actually}} a statement granting Mardjan all of the hadji's wealth. Furious at Mardjan's behaviour, Asmadi attacks him while Rachmat restrains the others. After a lengthy knife fight, Mardjan's foot is caught in <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks,</b> and he is soon killed by a passing train. Doerachman, pleased {{with the return of}} his wealth, destroys the letter and grants Rachmat permission to marry Atikah.|$|E
5|$|On {{the weekend}} of April 28, 1979, more than 15,000 people {{demonstrated}} against the Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant. The protest was coordinated with other anti-nuclear demonstrations across the country. Daniel Ellsberg and Allen Ginsberg were among the 284 people who were arrested. The demonstration followed {{more than six months}} of continuous protests that included an attempted blockade of <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks</b> leading to the site. Large pro-nuclear counter demonstrations were also staged that year.|$|E

5|$|Plans for {{the park}} were officially {{announced}} in March 1998 and construction began in September of that year. Initial construction was {{under the auspices of}} the Chicago Department of Transportation, because the project bridges <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks.</b> However, as the project grew and expanded, its broad variety of features and amenities outside the scope of the field of transportation placed it under the jurisdiction of the city's Public Buildings Commission.|$|E
5|$|The railroad's Purdy's {{station is}} a short {{distance}} west of the next junction, NY116, after which NY22 crosses under I-684, remaining between it and <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks.</b> Turning left onto Hardscrabble Road, it follows the tracks away from the interstate {{to the site of}} the next station, North Salem's hamlet of Croton Falls. Just north of the hamlet, Route22 crosses under the tracks, and is joined by US202. Immediately afterward, the road crosses back under the railroad again and enters Putnam County, following the Croton River north past the spillway of East Branch Reservoir.|$|E
5|$|After {{one block}} of Main Street, NY32 and NY212 turn onto Market Street, then east onto Ulster Avenue after another block. As it crosses <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks</b> {{and leaves the}} village, the road widens and becomes a {{commercial}} highway just before reaching a Thruway exit. This, the fourth time NY32 has crossed the Thruway, {{is the first time}} it does so at an exit. Beyond the overpass, the concurrency ends when NY32 turns and heads north once again. A tight nearby on-ramp provides access to the southbound Thruway. NY32 does not enter the Catskills but provides access to them along this stretch.|$|E

Designers used high visual screens along the roadway - to calm horses, livestock, and to keep drivers focused on the roadway and not distracted by trains.|$|R
5|$|Although Brunner died on February 14, 1925, {{elements}} of his plans were still completed, {{except for his}} People's Court, which became a parking lot. Brunner planned a bridge to cross <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks</b> and connect the capitol with the highest point in the city at 13thStreet. Brunner had also originally planned to have another bridge span the Susquehanna River, {{on the west side}} of the capitol. After his death, parts of the bridge were redesigned and became the current State Street Bridge, which was completed in 1930. The Education Building, or Forum Building, was completed in 1931.|$|E
5|$|Amanda caused heavy {{damage in}} the {{northeast}} Gulf of Mexico and the Florida Panhandle. In addition to sinking the USS Amanda, several other ships encountered the storm or were also capsized. At least 38deaths occurred at sea. In St. Marks, Florida, strong winds destroyed homes and fences, {{as well as the}} salt works, ruining about 40,000bushels of salt. Storm surge inundated crops and <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks.</b> A total of 40people and 48mules and oxen drowned. An additional 32people drowned at Dickerson Bay and Goose Creek. Some coastal forts were damaged, while tents and equipment used by Confederate troops were lost. In Tallahassee, heavy rainfall and severe gales were reported, damaging homes and other properties. The hurricane caused upward of 110fatalities.|$|E
5|$|On {{the east}} side of River Street, south from the Ypsilanti Automotive Heritage Museum across <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks,</b> the Mill Works Building, {{originally}} a foundry, contains the Ypsilanti Food Co-op and the River Street Bakery, owned by the co-op. On the roof of the Mill Works Building, Solar Ypsi installed 12 solar panels for the co-op in April 2009, followed by 30 panels for the bakery in 2010, producing a total of 8.3kilowatts during peak sunlight. Data from the meters can be viewed at the Solar Ypsi website, allowing anyone to compare generation from different sites.|$|E

5000|$|The {{turn of the}} 20th century saw {{the layout}} of the initial town streets. While [...] "Old County Road" [...] east of <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> <b>track</b> had been in use as a stage line since at least 1850, the present-day layout west of <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> <b>track</b> was {{constructed}} {{in the first years of}} 1900.

5|$|Past MS25, MS172 passes several {{businesses}} in Iuka {{as it comes}} to the MS25 Business junction. The route continues east through wooded residential neighborhoods prior to making a turn to the southeast. MS172 leaves Iuka and heads back into forests as an unnamed road, running a short distance to the southwest of a Norfolk Southern railroad line. Further southeast, the route draws closer to US72 and curves to the east, passing a few fields. MS172 makes a sharp turn south away from <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks</b> and comes to its eastern terminus at US72 immediately west of the Alabama border near Oldham. MS172 is legally defined in Mississippi Code § 65-3-3.|$|E
5|$|The bridge ends at a four-way {{intersection}} where US 5 turns left on Washington Avenue, Route 22 continues straight on Clintonville Road, and Route 103 begins {{on the right}} along Washington Avenue. The four-lane Washington Avenue runs through the commercial areas of North Haven still paralleling <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks,</b> crosses under I-91 (at exit 12) and continues into Wallingford as South Colony Street. At the town line is the Wharton Brook State Park just north {{of which is a}} short expressway connector (Wharton Brook Connector) to I-91 (at exit 13). South Colony Street narrows to two lanes within the Wallingford town center.|$|E
5|$|The highway follows <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks</b> into Beekmantown {{until it}} bears left at a fork, {{trending}} further west to Beekmantown Corners, where another short local road, County Route 58, formerly NY456, comes to its western end. After crossing {{into the next}} town, Chazy, NY22 bears left again at another fork to drift further to the west. The terrain around the road becomes increasingly wooded, with long unbroken stretches of pine, in the northern portion of the town. This is briefly broken at another western terminus of a short local road, County Route 23, formerly NY191, in the hamlet of Sciota.|$|E

5|$|US 5 {{begins on}} State Street at exit 5 of Interstate 91 in New Haven. State Street {{continues}} southwest into downtown as a local, unnumbered street. US 5 starts {{out as an}} undivided four-lane road becoming two lanes just before crossing into Hamden. State Street continues north through Hamden and the industrial section of North Haven, closely paralleling the Amtrak railroad tracks {{on the west side}} of the Quinnipiac River. It has an interchange with Route 40 in this area. US 5 then turns right at the intersection with Bishop Street in North Haven and crosses the Quinnipiac River, <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks,</b> and I-91 (at exit 11) overlapped with Route 22 on a four-lane wide road.|$|E
5|$|After another {{supermarket}} {{strip to}} the east, a long, gentle divided {{bend in the}} road almost a mile long ends with an overpass where NY55 comes in from the west. It joins NY22 as the two routes, returning to two lanes, pass through the eastern fringe of the village of Pawling and then by Trinity-Pawling School. Past the village, <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks</b> edge closer to the highway as NY22 enters the scenic Harlem Valley, which lends {{its name to the}} railroad line. The road curves more gently and takes longer straightaways, with lower density of residential and commercial development. Two miles from Pawling, the Appalachian Trail crosses the road next to the line's Appalachian Trail station. The flag stop allows hikers access to the nearby Pawling Nature Preserve.|$|E
5|$|Also {{close to}} the 35thparallel was the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. Its opening in the early 1880s led to the {{founding}} of towns like Holbrook and Adamana. Visitors could stop at the Adamana train station, book a hotel room, and take a tour of what was then called the Chalcedony Forest. Over the years, the line changed hands, becoming the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, and then the BNSF. More than 60 BNSF trains, mostly carrying freight, pass through the park every day. U.S. Route66, a former transcontinental auto highway developed in 1926 from part of the National Old Trails Road, ran parallel to <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks</b> until it was decommissioned in 1985. The park has preserved within its boundaries a small grassy section of the road. Interstate40, which crosses the park, replaced the older highway.|$|E
50|$|On April 5, the NTSB {{released}} {{a preliminary report}} about the accident. It focused on the apparent collision of the feed truck into <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> <b>track.</b> Tire tracks in the ground by <b>the</b> displaced <b>railroad</b> <b>track</b> matched <b>the</b> tires on a 2004 Kenworth International truck at a local feed lot owned by Cimarron Crossing Feeders, LLC.|$|R

5|$|Downtown Flagstaff lies {{immediately}} {{to the east of}} Mars Hill, the location of Lowell Observatory. Streets in the downtown area are laid out in a grid pattern, parallel to Route 66 and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Rail Line, running east–west through the city. Milton Road branches off from Route 66 west of downtown, and travels south, adjacent to the Northern Arizona University campus, to the junction of Interstate 17 and Interstate 40. Milton Road becomes I-17. A road called Beulah Boulevard, which also runs south, becomes State Route 89A, and travels through Oak Creek Canyon to Sedona. Traveling north from downtown, Fort Valley Road (U.S. 180) connects with the Museum of Northern Arizona, Arizona Snowbowl, and Grand Canyon National Park. Traveling east from downtown, Route 66 and the railroad run in parallel toward East Flagstaff (and beyond), at the base of Mount Elden. Much of Flagstaff's industry is located east of downtown, adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks,</b> as well as in East Flagstaff.|$|E
5|$|In the {{commercial}} {{center of the}} community, NY117 serves the Bedford Hills Metro-North station before widening to four lanes as it crosses <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks</b> and connects to exit39 of the Saw Mill River Parkway. For the next mile (1.6km), NY117 runs alongside {{the northern edge of}} the Saw Mill River Parkway as it heads through another residential part of Bedford Hills as a two-lane road. At Harris Road, the route turns southeastward, crossing the parkway and the adjacent railroad tracks again as it intersects with the parkway's exit42. NY117's southeastward run on Harris Road ends just past the railroad crossing, where the highway turns northeast onto an unnamed road leading to a commercial and industrial area south of the hamlet of Katonah. After turning onto the highway, NY117 serves various businesses before the route ends at the southbound-only exit43 of the Saw Mill River Parkway. NY117 northbound feeds into the northbound direction of the parkway, while exit43 serves as the start of NY117 southbound.|$|E
5|$|MD 410 {{continues}} east on Riverdale Road {{then turns}} southeast onto Veterans Parkway, a four-lane divided highway, while Riverdale Road continues toward New Carrollton. The highway briefly enters {{the city of}} New Carrollton around its intersection with MD 450 (Annapolis Road). MD 410 continues south and intersects Ellin Road before passing through a diamond interchange with US 50 (John Hanson Highway). The highway crosses over the Amtrak Northeast Corridor, MARC's Penn Line, and the Washington Metro's Orange Line. South of <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks,</b> MD 410 reaches its eastern terminus at Pennsy Drive, which leads to Ardwick Ardmore Road and the primary entrance to New Carrollton Station, which serves as the eastern terminus of the Orange Line and hosts MARC and Amtrak service. Secondary access to the station is provided by Ellin Road north of US 50.|$|E
