50|$|The {{transmission}} X-ray tube {{could deliver}} the X-ray beam {{more efficiently than}} a tube with a solid e-beam target. The thin target sheet has limited thermal capacity, and must be attached to a thicker, <b>thermally-conductive</b> material transparent to X-rays. Several mm of beryllium is used for end-window material which conducts heat, seals the vacuum and positions the target layer.|$|E
5000|$|To {{be able to}} {{transfer}} heat well, the tube material should have good thermal conductivity. Because heat is transferred from a hot to a cold side through the tubes, there is a temperature difference through {{the width of the}} tubes. Because of the tendency of the tube material to thermally expand differently at various temperatures, thermal stresses occur during operation. This is in addition to any stress from high pressures from the fluids themselves. The tube material also should be compatible with both the shell and tube side fluids for long periods under the operating conditions (temperatures, pressures, pH, etc.) to minimize deterioration such as corrosion. All of these requirements call for careful selection of strong, <b>thermally-conductive,</b> corrosion-resistant, high quality tube materials, typically metals, including aluminium, copper alloy, stainless steel, carbon steel, non-ferrous copper alloy, Inconel, nickel, Hastelloy and titanium. [...] Fluoropolymers such as Perfluoroalkoxy alkane (PFA) and Fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) are also used to produce the tubing material due to their high resistance to extreme temperatures. Poor choice of tube material could result in a leak through a tube between the shell and tube sides causing fluid cross-contamination and possibly loss of pressure.|$|E

40|$|This work {{reports the}} {{performance}} of an energy converter characterized by an emitting parallelepiped element with inside two, three, or five swirling connected combustion chambers. In particular, {{the idea is to}} adopt the heat released by H 2 /air combustion, occurring in the connected swirling chambers, to heat up the emitting surfaces of the <b>thermally-conductive</b> emitting parallelepiped brick. The final goal consists in obtaining the highest emitting surface temperature and the highest power delivered to the ambient environment, with the simultaneous fulfillment of four design constraints: dimension of the emitting surface fixed to 30 × 30 mm 2, solar mode thermal efficiency greater than 20 %, emitting surface peak temperature T > 1000 K, and its relative ∆T 99. 9 %, and high peak temperature, but the emitting surface ∆T is strongly sensitive to the geometrical configuration.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the synthesis of}} a low modulus, thermally conductive thermal interface materials (TIM) using metal decorated nanotubes as fillers. TIMs are very important in electronics because they act as a <b>thermally-conductive</b> medium for thermal transfer between the interface of a heat sink and an electronic package. The performance of an electronic package decreases with increasing operating temperature, hence, there exists a {{need to create a}} TIM which has high thermal conduction to reduce the operating temperature. The TIM in this study is made from metal decorated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and Vinnapas?BP 600 polymer. The sample was functionalized using mild oxidative treatment with nitric acid (HNO 3) or, with N-Methly- 2 -Pyrrolidone (NMP). The metals used for this experiment were copper (Cu), tin (Sn), and nickel (Ni). The metal nanoparticles were seeded using functionalized MWCNTs as templates. Once seeded, the nanotubes and polymer composites were made with or without sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS), as a surfactant. Thermal conductivity (k) measurement was carried out using ASTM D- 5470 method at room temperature. This setup best models the working conditions of a TIM. The TIM samples made for this study showed promise in their ability to have significant increase in thermal conduction while retaining the polymer?s mechanical properties. The highest k value that was obtained was 0. 72 W/m-K for a well dispersed aligned 5 wt percent Ni@MWCNT sample. The Cu samples underperformed both Ni and Sn samples for the same synthesis conditions. This is because Cu nanoparticles were significantly larger than those of Ni and Sn. They were large enough to cause alloy scattering and too large to attach to the nanotubes. Addition of <b>thermally-conductive</b> fillers, such as exfoliated graphite, did not yield better k results as it sunk to the bottom during drying. The use of SDBS greatly increased the k values of the sample by reducing agglomeration. Increasing the amount of metal@MWCNT wt percent in the sample had negative or no effect to the k values. Shear testing on the sample shows it adheres well to the surface when pressure is applied, yet it can be removed with ease...|$|E
40|$|Laser {{confocal}} microscopy {{is used to}} non-invasively {{investigate the}} steady and unsteady evolution of viscous microdroplets on solid substrates. Three characteristic dynamical regimes of spreading drops (viscous-capillary, viscous-inertia-capillary, and inertia-capillary) are studied using this non-invasive optical technique. It is shown that the dynamics of each regime depend on the Ohnesorge number, Oh=/(R) 1 2, and on the relative magnitudes of the droplet height, radius, compared with the capillary length, lcap=/g. The power-law relationships between the extent of spreading and elapsed time that are extracted from the experiments are in excellent agreement with available analytical results. We also study the onset and evolution of surface instabilities of the slightly volatile liquid films as they spread across the <b>thermally-conductive</b> surfaces. When the fluid droplet is a volatile silicone oil and the surface is a smooth silicon wafer, an evaporatively-driven thermocapillary instability leads to onset of a time-dependent free surface motion. Below a certain critical thickness (20 m), waves can be observed on the free surface of the film, and the confocal technique is {{used to measure the}} amplitude, the frequency, and non-linear evolution of these waves. We interpret these waves in terms of evaporatively-driven Marangoni instabilities induced by surface tension gradient...|$|E
40|$|Pool boiling heat {{transfer}} of water saturated at atmospheric pressure was investigated experimentally on Cu surfaces with high-temperature, <b>thermally-conductive,</b> microporous coatings (HTCMC). The coatings were created by sintering Cu powders on Cu surfaces in a nitrogen gas environment. A parametric study {{of the effects of}} particle size and coating thickness was conducted using three average particle sizes (APSs) of 10  μm, 25  μm, and 67  μm and various coating thicknesses. It was found that nucleate boiling {{heat transfer}} (NBHT) and critical heat flux (CHF) were enhanced significantly for sintered microporous coatings. This is believed to have resulted from the random porous structures that appear to include reentrant type cavities. The maximum NBHT coefficient was measured to be approximately 400 kW/m 2 k with APS 67  μm and 296  μm coating thicknesses. This value is approximately eight times higher than that of a plain Cu surface. The maximum CHF observed was 2. 1  MW/m 2 at APS 67  μm and 428  μm coating thicknesses, which is approximately double the CHF of a plain Cu surface. The enhancement of NBHT and CHF appeared to increase as the particle size increased in the tested range. However, two larger particle sizes (25  μm and 67  μm) showed a similar level of enhancement...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{potential}} benefits of using thermally-enhanced polymers in high-performance seawater heat exchangers are assessed. The thermal and mechanical properties of commercially available, <b>thermally-conductive</b> resins are reviewed and compared with those of polymer heat exchangers described in the literature, {{as well as those of}} metals commonly used in compact heat exchangers, including in seawater-based cooling systems (i. e., Cu-Ni alloys, stainless steel, and titanium). This survey reveals that engineered thermoplastics have sufficiently high thermal conductivities to compete with their metal counterparts. The thermo-fluid performance of a conceptual, doubly-finned plate liquid-liquid heat exchanger module, is analytically evaluated using the ε-NTU method. The heat transfer rate and coefficient of performance (COP) of this heat exchanger are parametrically assessed for various fin spacings, wall thicknesses, and a near 3 orders-of magnitude range of wall thermal conductivities. This analysis shows that the thermal conductivities achievable with enhanced thermoplastics, 20 W/mK, can provide approximately half the heat transfer rate of an aluminum heat exchanger operating under the same conditions, and 80 % of the heat transfer rate provided by a corrosion-resistant, metallic heat exchanger. This study indicates that thermally conductive thermoplastics offer a promising alternative to the use of conventional and/or corrosion-resistant metals in compact, high performance heat exchangers in seawater-cooled applications. ...|$|E
40|$|This work reports results {{related to}} the “EU-FP 7 -HRC-Power” project aiming at {{developing}} micro-meso hybrid sources of power. One {{of the goals of}} the project is to achieve surface temperatures up to more than 1000 K, with a ∆T ≤ 100 K, in order to be compatible with a thermal/electrical conversion by thermo-photovoltaic cells. The authors investigate how to reach that goal adopting swirling chambers integrated in a <b>thermally-conductive</b> and emitting element. The converter consists of a small parallelepiped brick inside two separated swirling meso-combustion chambers, which heat up the parallelepiped, emitting material by the combustion of H 2 and air at ambient pressure. The overall dimension is of the order of cm. Nine combustion simulations have been carried out assuming detailed chemistry, several length/diameter ratios (Z/D = 3, 5 and 11) and equivalence ratios (0. 4, 0. 7 and 1); all are at 400 W of injected chemical power. Among the most important results are the converter surfaces temperatures, the heat loads, provided to the environment, and the chemical efficiency. The high chemical efficiency, h > 99. 9 %, is due to the relatively long average gas residence time coupled with the fairly good mixing due to the swirl motion and the impinging air/fuel jets that provide heat and radicals to the flame...|$|E
40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{reports the}} latest investigations about a miniaturized hybrid energy power source, compatible with thermal/electrical conversion, by a thermo-photovoltaic cell, and potentially useful for civil and space applications. The converter is a <b>thermally-conductive</b> emitting parallelepiped element {{and the basic}} idea is to heat up its emitting surfaces by means of combustion, occurred in swirling chambers, integrated inside the device, and/or by the sun, which may work simultaneously or alternatively to the combustion. The current upgrades consist in examining whether the device might fulfill specific design constraints, adopting hydrocarbons-feeding. Previous papers, published by the author, demonstrate the hydrogen-feeding effectiveness. The project’s constraints are: 1) emitting surface dimensions fixed to 30 × 30 mm, 2) surface peak temperature T > 1000 K and the relative ∆T < 100 K (during the combustion mode), 3) the highest possible delivered power to the ambient, and 4) thermal efficiency greater than 20 % when works with solar energy. To this end, a 5 connected swirling chambers configuration (3 mm of diameter), with 500 W of injected chemical power, stoichiometric conditions and detailed chemistry, has been adopted. Reactive numerical simulations show that the stiff methane chemical structure obliges to increase the operating pressure, up to 10 atm, and to add hydrogen, to the methane fuel injection, {{in order to obtain}} stable combustion and efficient energy conversion...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLattice-matched II–VI {{selenide}} {{quantum well}} (QW) structures grown on InP substrates {{can be designed}} for emission throughout the visible spectrum. InP has, however, strong visible-light absorption, so that a method for epitaxial lift-off and transfer to transparent substrates is desirable for vertically-integrated devices. We have designed and grown, via molecular beam epitaxy, ZnCdSe/ZnCdMgSe multi-QW gain regions for vertical emission, with the QWs positioned for resonant periodic gain. The release of the 2. 7 μm-thick ZnCdSe/ZnCdMgSe multi-QW film is achieved via selective wet etching of the substrate and buffer layers leaving only the epitaxial layers, which are subsequently transferred to transparent substrates, including glass and <b>thermally-conductive</b> diamond. Post-transfer properties are investigated, with power and temperature-dependent surface- and edge-emitting photoluminescence measurements demonstrating no observable strain relaxation effects or significant shift in comparison to unprocessed samples. The temperature dependent QW emission shift is found experimentally to be 0. 13 nm/K. Samples capillary-bonded epitaxial-side to glass exhibited a 6 nm redshift under optical pumping of up to 35 mW at 405 nm, corresponding to a 46 K temperature increase in the pumped region; whereas those bonded to diamond exhibited no shift in QW emission, and thus efficient transfer of {{the heat from the}} pumped region. Atomic force microscopy analysis of the etched surface reveals a root-mean-square roughness of 3. 6 nm. High quality optical interfaces are required to establish a good thermal and optical contact for high power optically pumped laser applications...|$|E
