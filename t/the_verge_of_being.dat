5|$|By 2004, {{the owners}} were {{claiming}} that player salaries had grown far faster than revenues, {{and that the}} league as a whole lost over US$300 million in 2002–03. As a result, on September 15, 2004 Gary Bettman announced that the owners again locked the players out {{before the start of}} the 2004–05 season. On February 16, 2005, Bettman announced the cancellation of the entire season. As with the 1994–95 lockout, the owners were again demanding a salary cap, which the players were unwilling to consider until the season was on <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> lost. The season's cancellation led to a revolt within the union. NHLPA president Trevor Linden and senior director Ted Saskin took charge of negotiations from executive director Bob Goodenow. By early July, the two sides had agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement. The deal featured a hard salary cap, linked to a fixed percentage of league revenues and a 24% rollback on salaries.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} mobilization, the Life Guards arrived at their {{assigned}} position near the Belgian border. Strachwitz and his platoon volunteered for a mounted, long-distance reconnaissance patrol, which would penetrate far behind Belgian lines. His orders were to gather intelligence on rail and communications connections and potentially disturb them, {{as well as}} report on the war preparations being made by their opponents. If the situation allowed, he was to destroy railway and telephone connections and to derail trains, causing as much havoc as possible. His patrol ran into many obstacles and they were constantly on <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> detected by either British or French forces. Their objective was the Paris–Limoges–Bordeaux train track. Strachwitz dispatched a messenger, who broke through to the German lines and delivered the intelligence they had gathered. The patrol blew up the signal box at the Fontainebleau railway station, and tried to force their way through to presumed German troops at the Marne near Châlons. However, the French forces were too strong and {{they were unable to}} get through. After six weeks behind the lines their rations were depleted and they had to resort to stealing or begging. Strachwitz then decided to head for Switzerland, hoping that the French–Swiss border was not as heavily protected. After a brief skirmish with French forces, one of Strachwitz's men was seriously wounded, which forced them to seek medical attention. During many weeks of outdoor living their uniforms had deteriorated, so Strachwitz took that opportunity to buy new clothes for his men. Their progress was slowed by the wounded man, and the group was caught in civilian clothes by French forces.|$|E

40|$|Organic {{photovoltaic}} (OPV) {{devices are}} on <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> commercialization <b>being</b> long-term stability a key challenge. Morphology evolution during lifetime {{has been suggested}} {{to be one of}} the main pathways accounting for performance degradation. There is however a lack of certainty on how specifically the morphology evolution relates to individual electrical parameters on operating devices. In this work a case study is created based on a thermodynamically unstable organic active layer which is monitored over a period of one year under non-accelerated degradation conditions. The morphology evolution is revealed by compositional analysis of ultrathin cross-sections using nanoscale imaging in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) coupled with electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). Additionally, devices are electrically monitored in real-time using the non-destructive electrical techniques capacitance–voltage (C–V) and Impedance Spectroscopy (IS). By comparison of imaging and electrical techniques the relationship between nanoscale morphology and individual electrical parameters of device operation can be conclusively discerned. It is ultimately observed how the change in the cathode contact properties occurring after the migration of fullerene molecules explains the improvement in the overall device performance.

25|$|By {{the late}} 18th century, the combat ability of Zaporozhia was greatly reduced, {{especially}} after the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca and the Russian annexation of Crimea, when {{the need for the}} Host to guard the borders was removed.

It is impossible to distinguish Fellini from his fictional director and so Fellini's faults coincide with Guido's spiritual doubts. The osmosis between art and life is amazing.

25|$|Neither {{side was}} able to achieve a decisive {{advantage}} during {{the first years of}} the war; the Empress came to control the south-west of England and much of the Thames Valley, while Stephen remained in control of the south-east. The castles of the period were easily defensible, and much of the fighting was attritional in character, comprising sieges, raiding and skirmishing between armies of knights and footsoldiers, many of them mercenaries.
