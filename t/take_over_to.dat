5|$|The {{potential}} redevelopment of Sembawang Hot Spring into {{a national}} park is currently being explored. The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) said on 23 April 2016 that it is prepared to return the land occupied by the hot spring to the Singapore Land Authority. MINDEF hopes a public agency such as the National Parks Board (NParks) can <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> improve and maintain the place, while constructing amenities such as toilets and adding more greenery. The ministry added that putting the place under a public agency means the land need not be tendered out {{to the highest bidder}} and become commercialised.|$|E
5|$|Celtic's league title win in 1998 {{gave the}} club their first {{opportunity}} {{to compete in the}} rebranded UEFA Champions League in 1998–99. Two qualifying rounds had first to be negotiated, however. St Patrick's Athletic were knocked out, but Celtic were then paired up against a strong Croatia Zagreb side comprising several players who had helped Croatia to third place at the 1998 World Cup. The first leg took place in Glasgow amidst a row between Celtic players and the club bosses over bonuses. A Darren Jackson goal gave Celtic a 10 win to <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Zagreb, but an insipid second leg performance in match dominated by Robert Prosinečki saw Celtic beaten 30 to go out on aggregate. Only a fine showing from Jonathan Gould in goal saved Celtic from a more emphatic defeat. The club dropped into the UEFA Cup. Portuguese side Vitória de Guimarães were defeated 21 in both legs in the first round, but Celtic crashed out in the second round against Zürich 53 on aggregate as a public row between captain Paul Lambert and managing director Jock Brown raged behind the scenes.|$|E

Of her departure, Bower told Colin Vickery of the Herald Sun, [...] "I love Neighbours, it is a wonderful show and because of this I felt it was important that fresh eyes and brains <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> keep this Australian icon contemporary.

Then she asked what horse he was going to put to it, and he told her old Ripstaver.

Peter agreed to this, and so it happened that when I went to the barn the next morning, as soon as I had seen Peter drive away in the buggy, I found the only horse in the stable was old Ripstaver. I was mad enough, I can tell you; for if Rebecca made any noise and woke her father he could overtake that old mare long before she could get to the village.
