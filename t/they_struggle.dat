5|$|A {{particular}} critical {{success was}} The Year of the Sex Olympics, broadcast {{as part of}} BBC2's Theatre 625 series in July 1968. Kneale's first television work {{to be made in}} colour—although only a black-and-white copy now survives—the story was based in a future where {{the majority of the population}} are kept in a docile state by constant broadcasts of pornography and other low-brow reality television programming. The Live Life Show, in which a family are watched twenty-four hours a day as <b>they</b> <b>struggle</b> to live on an isolated rural island, becomes a massive success, especially when a murderer is introduced into the set-up.|$|E
5|$|Although Buffy and {{her friends}} deal with death every week, often in very gruesome and fantastic ways, in this episode they are bewildered by the natural death of Joyce Summers, the {{divorced}} mother of Buffy and her sister Dawn and occasionally a mother figure to their friends. <b>They</b> <b>struggle</b> to comprehend what the loss means {{to each of them}} and to the group. Buffy must begin to face her life and her duties as the Slayer without parental support and comfort. The episode was stripped of all music—a regular staple of the Buffy series—and disorienting effects were included to convey the sense of displacement and loss associated with the death of a close family member.|$|E

Catching up to the boat, Tintin finds that Alonso and Ramón are aboard, and <b>they</b> <b>struggle</b> for the possession of the fetish. It smashes on the deck, with the diamond falling into the sea. Tintin, Alonso and Ramón struggle, and fall overboard. Tintin is rescued, but Alonso and Ramón drown and are shown en route to Hell. Goldbarr gives Tintin the stolen fetish {{to return to the}} museum, where it is repaired and put back on display.|$|E

25|$|O'Neill's plays {{were among}} the first to include speeches in American vernacular and involve {{characters}} on the fringes of society. <b>They</b> <b>struggle</b> to maintain their hopes and aspirations, but ultimately slide into disillusionment and despair. Of his very few comedies, only one is well-known (Ah, Wilderness!). Nearly all of his other plays involve some degree of tragedy and personal pessimism.|$|E
25|$|Although {{a monster}} movie, {{the central theme}} explores what {{ordinary}} people will be driven to do under extraordinary circumstances. The plot revolves around members of {{the small town of}} Bridgton, Maine who, after a severe thunderstorm causes the power to go out the night before, meet in a supermarket to pick up supplies.

25|$|The Arctic Ocean has {{relatively}} little plant life except for phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are {{a crucial part}} of the ocean and there are massive amounts of them in the Arctic, where they feed on nutrients from rivers and the currents of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. During summer, the sun is out day and night, thus enabling the phytoplankton to photosynthesize {{for long periods of time}} and reproduce quickly. However, the reverse is true in winter when <b>they</b> <b>struggle</b> to get enough light to survive.|$|E
25|$|The jungle {{world of}} Monthax is {{the setting for}} the end of Ghostmaker, when Gaunt and his men {{encounter}} the alien Eldar as <b>they</b> <b>struggle</b> to wipe out a Chaos infestation. The Ghosts have to co-operate once again with the Royal Volpone 50th, and with an inquisitor who had accused Brin Milo of witchcraft. They discover an ancient portal leading to one of the Eldar's craftworlds, self-sustaining cities in space, which the inquisitor, Lilith Abferquan, closes after the alien Farseer guarding the portal dies. At the end of this battle, the Ghosts lost an excellent leader, Sergeant Lerod.|$|E

25|$|The {{changing}} {{economic environment}} {{has a significant}} impact on banks and thrifts as <b>they</b> <b>struggle</b> to effectively manage their interest rate spread in the face of low rates on loans, rate competition for deposits and the general market changes, industry trends and economic fluctuations. It has been a challenge for banks to effectively set their growth strategies with the recent economic market. A rising interest rate environment may seem to help financial institutions, but the effect of the changes on consumers and businesses is not predictable and the challenge remains for banks to grow and effectively manage the spread to generate a return to their shareholders.|$|E
25|$|After the Earth removes an iron shard from Schaffa's brain, dooming him to {{an early}} death, Nassun decides to use the Gate to {{transform}} everyone on Earth into stone eaters, rather than destroying the Earth and Moon outright. Essun arrives and attempts to seize control of the Gate using the central control obelisk in order to return the Moon to orbit, end the Seasons, and save Nassun from certain death. <b>They</b> <b>struggle,</b> but neither can gain an upper edge, and Essun gives up to allow her daughter to complete her task, rather than risk her destruction. She releases control of the Gate and is completely turned to stone. Nassun, moved by the sight, decides to complete her mother’s task and use the Gate to return the Moon to orbit.|$|E
25|$|The {{boys are}} still trapped in 1867, Fergus is still {{busy in the}} gold fields, and Daniel tries {{to find a way}} to help Constance.

25|$|Rivers {{are major}} point sources of {{sediment}} {{contribution to the}} coastal sedimentary budget, this being particularly true of coasts with a steep gradient, where rivers directly dump their sediments at the coast. Coasts with a low gradient may lose river sediment to estuaries. Sediment delivery to the shoreline can be very intermittent mostly occurring during floods {{with the increase in}} flow typically creating an increase in sediment supplied to the coast. Some rivers are referred to as ‘large’ because they produce high amounts of sediment for which to nourish the coastal environment. For example, the Waimakariri River on the coast of Canterbury, New Zealand produces 77% of sediment supplied to the Pegasus Bay coastline. This is not always the case with some rivers referred to as ‘small’ because <b>they</b> <b>struggle</b> to supply enough sediment to keep their coastlines from eroding, for example, the Rakaia River South of Banks Peninsula in Canterbury, New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Labour is {{different}} for textile production than for agricultural commodities because textile production {{takes place in}} a factory, not on a farm. Children provide a source of cheap labor, and child labor is prevalent in Pakistan, India, and Nepal. Fair trade cooperatives ensure fair and safe labor practices, including disallowing child labor. Fair trade textile producers are most often women in developing countries. <b>They</b> <b>struggle</b> with meeting the consumer tastes in North America and Europe. In Nepal, textiles were originally made for household and local use. In the 1990s, women began joining cooperatives and exporting their crafts for profit. Now handicrafts are Nepal's largest export. It is often difficult for women to balance textile production, domestic responsibilities, and agricultural work. Cooperatives foster the growth of democratic communities in which women have a voice despite being historically in underprivileged positions. For fair trade textiles and other crafts to be successful in western markets, World Fair Trade Organizations require a flexible workforce of artisans in need of stable income, links from consumers to artisans, and a market for quality ethnic products.|$|E
25|$|Buck's next {{owners are}} {{a trio of}} stampeders (Hal, Charles, and a woman named Mercedes from the United States), who are inexperienced at {{surviving}} in the Northern wilderness. <b>They</b> <b>struggle</b> to control the sled and ignore warnings that the spring melt poses dangers. They overfeed the dogs and then starve them when the food runs out. On their journey they meet John Thornton, an experienced outdoorsman, who notices the dogs have been poorly treated and are in a weakened condition. He warns the trio against crossing the river, but they ignore his advice and order Buck to move on. Exhausted, starving, and sensing the danger ahead, Buck refuses and continues to lie unmoving in the snow. After Buck is beaten by Hal, Thornton recognizes {{him to be a}} remarkable dog. Disgusted by the driver's treatment of Buck, Thornton hits Hal with the butt of his axe, cuts Buck free from his traces, and tells the trio he is keeping him, much to Hal's displeasure. After some argument, the trio leaves and tries to cross the river, but as Thornton warned, the ice breaks, and the three fall into the river and drown, along with the sled and neglected dogs.|$|E
