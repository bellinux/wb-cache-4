5|$|Antibiotics are {{frequently}} applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> or taken orally to treat acne and {{are thought to}} work due to their antimicrobial activity against P. acnes {{and their ability to}} reduce inflammation. With the widespread use of antibiotics for acne and an increased frequency of antibiotic-resistant P. acnes worldwide, antibiotics are becoming less effective, especially macrolide antibiotics such as topical erythromycin. Commonly used antibiotics, either applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> or taken orally, include clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, sulfacetamide, and tetracyclines such as doxycycline and minocycline. When antibiotics are applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> they are typically used for mild to moderately severe acne. Antibiotics taken orally are generally considered to be more effective than topical antibiotics, and produce faster resolution of inflammatory acne lesions than topical applications. Topical and oral antibiotics are not recommended for use together.|$|E
5|$|Frequently used topical retinoids include adapalene, isotretinoin, retinol, tazarotene, and tretinoin. They often {{cause an}} initial {{flare-up}} of acne and facial flushing, {{and can cause}} significant skin irritation. Generally speaking, retinoids increase the skin's sensitivity to sunlight and are therefore recommended for use at night. Tretinoin is the least expensive of the topical retinoids and is the most irritating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> whereas adapalene is the least irritating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> but costs significantly more. Tazarotene {{is the most effective}} and expensive topical retinoid, but is not as well-tolerated. Retinol is a form of vitamin A that has similar but milder effects, and is used in many over-the-counter moisturizers and other topical products.|$|E

5|$|The glands deposit sebum on the hairs, {{and bring}} it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> surface along the hair shaft. The {{structure}} consisting of hair, hair follicle, arrector pili muscles, and sebaceous gland is an epidermal invagination known as a pilosebaceous unit.|$|E
5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} of COPD {{is defined}} as increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, {{a change in the}} color of the sputum from clear to green or yellow, or an increase in cough in someone with COPD. This may present with signs of increased work of breathing such as fast breathing, a fast heart rate, sweating, active use of muscles in the neck, a bluish tinge <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> and confusion or combative behavior in very severe exacerbations. Crackles may also be heard over the lungs on examination with a stethoscope.|$|E
50|$|At higher {{concentrations}} (10-50%) {{the effects}} of GA are more pronounced, but application must be limited.

5|$|Clindamycin is an {{antibiotic}} {{useful for the}} treatment of a number of bacterial infections. This includes middle ear infections, bone or joint infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, strep throat, pneumonia, and endocarditis among others. It can be useful against some cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It may also be used for acne and in addition to quinine for malaria. It is available by mouth, intravenously, and as a cream to be applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> or in the vagina.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the appearance and distribution of the rash, specific medical signs may be used by medical practitioners to assist with diagnosis. These may include Auspitz's sign (pinpoint bleeding when scale is removed), Koebner phenomenon (psoriatic skin lesions induced by trauma <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin),</b> and itching and pain localized to papules and plaques.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{spitting}} cobras, {{this species}} {{is known for}} its ability to project venom at a potential threat. The venom is an irritant <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> and eyes. If it enters the eyes, symptoms include extreme burning pain, loss of coordination, partial loss of vision, and permanent blindness. N. nigricollis {{is known for its}} tendency to liberally spit venom and bite with only the slightest provocation.|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{mechanism}} of tapered piles and evidence of small scale model tests, the cylindrical cavity expansion theory has been proposed <b>to</b> evaluate <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> friction of tapered piles by introducing stress-dilatancy relationship. Generally, either {{angle of internal friction}} or dilatancy angle was assumed to be constant <b>to</b> compute <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> friction. In this research this drawback has been removed and adopted both properties <b>to</b> evaluate <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> friction at each depth iteratively. The test result and proposed model show that a slight increase in tapering angle of the pile results in higher skin friction comparing with conventional straight piles on different types of sands at different relative densities. The parametric studies on different types of model tests, prototype tests and real type pile tests have been assessed <b>to</b> evaluate <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> friction and predict the proposed model. The proposed model validates <b>the</b> determination of <b>skin</b> friction using stress-dilatancy relation with reference to cavity expansion theory...|$|R
5|$|Midbody {{there are}} 21 dorsal scales rows (rarely 19, 20, 22, or 23). These are {{strongly}} keeled scales, {{except for those}} bordering the ventral scales. These scales seem loosely attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> and lower rows become increasingly wide; those closest to the ventral scales are twice {{as wide as the}} ones along the midline. The ventral scales number 132-150 in males and 132–158 in females. The anal plate is single. The subcaudals are paired, numbering 32–46 in males and 23–38 in females.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis is a {{long-lasting}} {{autoimmune disease}} characterized by patches of abnormal skin. These skin patches are typically red, itchy, and scaly. Psoriasis varies in severity from small, localized patches to complete body coverage. Injury <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> can trigger psoriatic skin changes at that spot, {{which is known}} as the Koebner phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|Spilled hot {{cooking oil}} {{can also cause}} severe third degree burns, In the {{worst-case}} scenario, severe burns can be fatal. The higher temperatures and tendency of oil to stick <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> make spilled hot cooking oil far more dangerous than spilled hot water. Children can accidentally place their hands {{on top of the}} stove, playing with the materials while being cooked, or accidentally pull the pot down, which can cause significant injury. The utmost care should be used when deep frying when children are present, to protect their safety at all times.|$|E

5|$|Tesla {{noted the}} hazards of working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices. In his many notes on the early {{investigation}} of this phenomenon, he attributed the skin damage to various causes. He believed early on that damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> was not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by the ozone generated {{in contact with the}} skin, and to a lesser extent, by nitrous acid. Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in waves in plasmas. These plasma waves can occur in force-free magnetic fields.|$|E
5|$|The {{filaments}} {{are preserved}} with {{a gap between}} the bones, which several authors have noted corresponds closely to the expected amount of skin and muscle tissue that would have been present in life. The feathers are closest to the bone on the skull and end of the tail, where little to no muscle was present, and the gap increases over the back vertebrae, where more musculature would be expected, indicating that the filaments were external <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> and do not correspond with subcutaneous structures.|$|E

5|$|Two sets {{of muscles}} are {{associated}} with the outer ear: the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. In some mammals, these muscles can adjust the direction of the pinna. In humans, these muscles have little or no effect. The ear muscles are supplied by the facial nerve, which also supplies sensation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> of the ear itself, {{as well as to the}} external ear cavity. The great auricular nerve, auricular nerve, auriculotemporal nerve, and lesser and greater occipital nerves of the cervical plexus all supply sensation to parts of the outer ear and the surrounding skin.|$|E
5|$|Unlike fruit bats, {{the vampire}} bats have short, conical muzzles. It also lacks a nose leaf, instead having naked pads with U-shaped grooves at the tip. The common vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus, also has {{specialized}} thermoreceptors on its nose, which aid the animal in locating {{areas where the}} blood flows close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> of its prey.

5|$|A 1951 letter {{showed that}} Bradner clearly {{understood}} that the insulation in such a suit was not provided by the water between the suit and the skin, but rather that this layer of water next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> if trapped, would quickly heat to skin temperature, if the material in the suit were insulative. Thus, the suit only needed to limit purging by fresh cold water, {{and it did not}} need to be dry to work. He applied for a U.S. patent for the wetsuit, but his patent application was turned down due to its similar design with the flight suit. The United States Navy also did not adopt the new wetsuits because of worries that the neoprene in the wetsuits might make its swimmers easier to spot by underwater sonar and, thus, could not exclusively profit from his invention.|$|E
