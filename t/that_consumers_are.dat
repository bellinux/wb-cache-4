25|$|Scores {{are based}} on RI's seven {{dimensions}} of reputation: products/services, innovation, workplace, citizenship, governance, leadership and performance. RI said the 2008 survey indicates <b>that</b> <b>consumers</b> <b>are</b> most influenced by a company's high-quality products and services {{as well as its}} governance and citizenship.|$|E
25|$|In human economics, {{a typical}} demand curve has {{negative}} slope. This means {{that as the}} price of a certain good increases, the amount <b>that</b> <b>consumers</b> <b>are</b> willing and able to purchase decreases. Researchers studying the demand curves of non-human animals, such as rats, also find downward slopes.|$|E
25|$|In {{many cities}} using {{reclaimed}} water, {{it is now}} in such demand <b>that</b> <b>consumers</b> <b>are</b> only allowed to use it on assigned days. Some cities that previously offered unlimited reclaimed water at a flat rate {{are now beginning to}} charge citizens by the amount they use.|$|E
50|$|The amount <b>that</b> a <b>consumer</b> <b>is</b> {{ready to}} pay for a {{particular}} good minus the amount <b>that</b> the <b>consumer</b> actually pays. The amount <b>that</b> the <b>consumer</b> <b>is</b> willing to pay has to be greater.|$|R

5000|$|Most {{sales are}} {{concentrated}} in developed nations. In 2008, 69% of Americans claimed to occasionally buy organic products, down from 73% in 2005. One theory for this change <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>consumers</b> <b>were</b> substituting [...] "local" [...] produce for [...] "organic" [...] produce.|$|R
25|$|Several {{studies have}} shown <b>that</b> <b>consumers</b> <b>are</b> likely {{to spend more money}} when they pay by credit card. Researchers suggest that when people pay using credit cards, they do not {{experience}} the abstract pain of payment. Furthermore, researchers have found that using credit cards can increase consumption of unhealthy food.|$|E
25|$|Shelf {{life is not}} {{significantly}} studied during drug development, and drug manufacturers have economic and liability incentives to specify shorter shelf lives so <b>that</b> <b>consumers</b> <b>are</b> encouraged to discard and repurchase products. One major exception is the Shelf Life Extension Program (SLEP) of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), which commissioned a major study of drug efficacy from the FDA starting in the mid-1980s. One criticism is that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) refused to issue guidelines based on SLEP research for normal marketing of pharmaceuticals even though the FDA performed the study. The SLEP and FDA signed a memorandum that scientific data could not be shared with the public, public health departments, other government agencies, and drug manufacturers. State and local programs {{are not permitted to}} participate. The failure to share data has caused foreign governments to refuse donations of expired medications. One exception occurred during the 2010 Swine Flu Epidemic when the FDA authorized expired Tamiflu based on SLEP Data. The SLEP discovered that drugs such as Cipro remained effective nine years after their shelf life, and, as a cost-saving measure, the US military routinely uses a wide range of SLEP tested products past their official shelf life if drugs have been stored properly.|$|E
500|$|Other {{consumer}} advocacy groups, {{notably the}} National Consumers League, expressed dismay at the popular reaction against the product, {{and especially the}} plant closures [...] "because of business the company has lost to very serious misinformation, widely disseminated by the media, about its product, lean finely textured beef (LFTB)". Similarly, the Consumer Federation of America said the plant closures were [...] "unfortunate" [...] and {{expressed concern that the}} product might be replaced in ground beef with [...] "something that has not been processed to assure the same level of safety". U.S. consumers have expressed concerns that ground beef which contains the product is not labeled as such, and <b>that</b> <b>consumers</b> <b>are</b> currently unable to make informed purchasing decisions due to this lack of product labeling. Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey called upon the USDA to institute mandatory labeling guidelines for ground beef sold in supermarkets, so consumers can make informed purchasing decisions.|$|E

50|$|Unpakt {{was founded}} in November 2010 after observing the {{complicated}} process of searching for a moving company. Ben-Harosh also founded FlatRate Moving in 1991. Overcome by inaccurate or misleading information on the internet, he found <b>that</b> <b>consumers</b> <b>were</b> unable to verify which moving companies were credible and trustworthy.|$|R
50|$|The philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre {{asserted}} {{that almost all}} of Marcuse's key positions are false and that his generalizations were based upon the total absence of any account of contemporary social structure. Featherstone criticized his portrayal of modern consumerism: it falsely assumed <b>that</b> <b>consumers</b> <b>were</b> completely passive, uncritically responding to corporate advertising.|$|R
500|$|Hayek {{created the}} Austrian {{business}} cycle theory, which synthesizes Menger's capital theory and Mises's {{theory of money}} and credit. The theory proposes a model of inter-temporal investment in which production plans precede the manufacture of the finished product. The producers revise production plans to adapt to changes in consumer preferences. Producers respond to [...] "derived demand," [...] which is estimated demand for the future, instead of current demand. If consumers reduce their spending, producers believe <b>that</b> <b>consumers</b> <b>are</b> saving for additional spending later, so that production remains constant. Combined with a market of loanable funds (which relates savings and investment through the interest rate), this theory of capital production leads to {{a model of the}} macroeconomy where markets reflect inter-temporal preferences. Hayek's model suggests that an economic bubble begins when cheap credit initiates a boom where resources are misallocated, so that early stages of production receive more resources than they should and overproduction begins; the later stages of capital are not funded for maintenance to prevent depreciation. Overproduction in the early stages cannot be processed by poorly maintained later stage capital. The boom becomes a bust when a lack of finished goods leads to [...] "forced saving" [...] since fewer finished goods can be produced for sale.|$|E
2500|$|About {{six months}} after release, Nintendo {{reported}} their usage statistics for the Switch. Using statistics collected by the system for the primary player on the console, they found that 30% of users operate the console in Handheld/Tabletop mode more than 80% of the time, slightly more than 50% of users operate the console in both TV mode and Handheld/Tabletop mode equally, with the remaining users preferring TV mode. Nintendo stated [...] "We can clearly see <b>that</b> <b>consumers</b> <b>are</b> playing to suit their own play styles." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most {{consumers}} {{agree that}} while achieving business targets, companies should do CSR {{at the same}} time. Most consumers believe companies doing charity work will receive a positive response. Somerville also found <b>that</b> <b>consumers</b> <b>are</b> loyal and willing to spend more on retailers that support charity. Consumers also believe that retailers selling local products will gain loyalty. Smith (2013) shares the belief that marketing local products will gain consumer trust. However, environmental efforts are receiving negative views given the belief that this would affect customer service. Oppewal et al. (2006) found that not all CSR activities are attractive to consumers. They recommended that retailers focus on one activity. Becker-Olsen (2006) [...] found that if the social initiative done by the company is not aligned with other company goals {{it will have a}} negative impact. Mohr et al. (2001) and Groza et al. (2011) also emphasise the importance of reaching the consumer.|$|E

5000|$|Consumer-to-{{business}} (C2B) is {{a business}} model in which consumers (individuals) create value and businesses consume that value.

40|$|Are young {{consumers}} {{easier to}} attract? We {{shed some light}} on the presumption <b>that</b> younger <b>consumers</b> <b>are</b> less loyal to brands and more willing than older consumers to try new brands. Analysis of 230 brands from 12 categories revealed a tendency for new and growing brands to skew towards younger <b>consumers.</b> This suggests <b>that</b> younger <b>consumers</b> <b>are</b> slightly easier for brands to attract. The most plausible explanation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> younger <b>consumers</b> <b>are</b> more likely to be new buyers of the category. We therefore caution that our results do not support a marketing strategy strongly targeting younger consumers. If a brand grows, then it is likely to attract a slightly disproportionate number of younger consumers. However, it does not follow that, if it seeks largely to attract younger consumers, it will grow. ...|$|R
