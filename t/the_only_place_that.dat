25|$|Rumiko Takahashi {{stated that}} Ranma ½ was {{conceived}} to be a martial arts manga that connects {{all aspects of}} everyday life to martial arts. Because her previous series had female protagonists, the author decided that she wanted a male this time. However, {{she was worried about}} writing a male main character, and therefore decided to make him half-female. Before deciding on water for initiating his changes, she considered Ranma changing every time he was punched. It was after deciding this that she felt Jusenkyo had to be set in China, as it is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> could have such mysterious springs. She drew inspiration for Ranma ½ from a variety of real-world objects. Some of the places frequently seen in the series are modeled after actual locations in Nerima, Tokyo (both the home of Takahashi and the setting of Ranma ½).|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} allocator proposal incorporated some language {{features that}} had not yet been accepted by the committee, namely the ability to use template arguments that are themselves templates. Since these features could not be compiled by any existing compiler, there was, according to Stepanov, [...] "an enormous demand on Bjarne 's and Andy 's time trying to verify that we were using these non-implemented features correctly." [...] Where the library had previously used pointer and reference types directly, it would now only refer to the types defined by the allocator. Stepanov later described allocators as follows: [...] "A nice feature of STL is that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> mentions the machine-related types (...) is encapsulated within roughly 16 lines of code." ...|$|E

Ballard swiftly gathered his squadron, the frigate HMS Thetis under Captain George Miller and the sloops [...] and , and positioned them in the channel between Guadeloupe and the Îles des Saintes, through which Roquebert's ships would have to pass.

500|$|Crocodilians are [...] reptiles, {{spending}} part {{of their}} time in water and part on land. The last surviving fully terrestrial genus, Mekosuchus, became extinct about 3000 years ago after humans had arrived on its Pacific islands, making the extinction possibly anthropogenic. Typically they are creatures of the tropics; the main exceptions are the American and Chinese alligators, whose ranges extend as far north as the south-eastern United States and the Yangtze River, respectively. Florida, in the United States, is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> crocodiles and alligators live side by side. Most crocodilians live in the lowlands, and few are found above , where the temperatures are typically about 5°C (9°F) lower than at the coast. None of them permanently reside in the sea, though some can venture into it, and several species can tolerate the brackish water of estuaries, mangrove swamps, and the extreme salinity of hypersaline lakes. The saltwater crocodile has the widest distribution of any crocodilian, with a range extending from eastern India to New Guinea and northern Australia. Much of its success is due to its ability to swim out to sea and colonise new locations, but it is not restricted to the marine environment and spends much time in estuaries, rivers, and large lakes.|$|E
500|$|Some of Fishing Creek is stocked by the Fishing Creek Sportsman's Association and {{contains}} populations of brook trout, rainbow trout, and brown trout. Many {{of them are}} sizable; the largest one caught in Fishing Creek weighed [...] and was [...] long. All streams in the watershed are suitable for trout habitation according to the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. An 1887 book stated that Fishing Creek and its tributaries may have once been [...] "alive with trout". In {{the upper part of}} the watershed, wild brook trout are most common in West Branch Fishing Creek and fish in general are least common in East Branch Fishing Creek. West Creek has higher fish diversity than any other stream in {{the upper part of the}} watershed and is also <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> is inhabited by wild brown trout. In addition, sculpin and cutlips minnow have been observed in large numbers in the creek and its tributaries. Less commonly observed fish in the upper part of the watershed include johnny darters, white suckers, and black-nosed dace. It is difficult for fish to spawn in the creek because of poor water quality near Benton, a lack of food, and dry headwaters for part of the year. The fish diversity in East Branch Fishing Creek and West Branch Fishing Creek is also significantly affected by episodic acidification, which is caused by acid rain falling in areas with no limestone in the bedrock. The main stem experiences similar problems but to a lesser extent, and the tributaries Coles Creek and West Creek experience the problems even less.|$|E

His relationship with the other Noldor princes seemed to mirror that of his older brother Maedhros who desired to unify against Morgoth. Maglor was present with many warriors from east Beleriand at the [...] "Feast of Reuniting", Mereth Aderthad, hosted by Fingolfin in [...] near the Pools of Ivrin. Daeron, the greatest bard of the elves was also there, but nothing is said of the meeting of Maglor and Daeron. Finrod, son of Finarfin, hunted with Maedhros and Maglor in Estolad just before he met the Edain for the first time.

2500|$|After {{securing}} press credentials {{for herself}} and a photographer, and after visiting Peru's Congress to interview some of its members and attend sessions where she took notes and sketched a seating plan, Berenson was arrested on a public bus along with the photographer. Her photographer {{turned out to be}} the wife of a top MRTA leader, a fact which Berenson stated she was unaware of at that time. The MRTA is alleged to have intended to use the information to seize lawmakers and exchange the hostages for imprisoned MRTA members. The house she rented in Lima was found to contain an arsenal of weapons and ammunition, together with armed guerrillas who violently resisted capture. She denied knowing of the presence of either the weaponry or the guerillas, and she also denied knowing that the documents she prepared would be used for terrorism. In 2011 she admitted that she had known that her associates were MRTA members and she said: [...] "It might not have been intentional, but the bottom line is: I did collaborate with them." [...] In the same interview she maintained that she had not been aware that weapons were being amassed in the upper floors of her house which she had sublet to the MRTA members, and she also maintained that she was unaware that violent actions were being planned at the Congress, stating that [...] "at that time in Fujimori’s dictatorship, Congress was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> there was some sort of democratic process." ...|$|E
