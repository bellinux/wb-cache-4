40|$|The use of photosensitizing drugs {{associated}} with {{different types of}} delivery vehicle has received strong interest {{within the field of}} the photodynamic therapy of tumours. Lipid-based delivery vehicles, such as liposomes and oil emulsions, allow the administration of water-insoluble photosensitizers, widening the choice of photosensitizers potentially useful for treating tumours. In some cases, these delivery vehicles increase the selectivity of <b>tumour</b> <b>targeting</b> by favouring photosensitizer uptake in tumour tissue. However, a higher selectivity of <b>tumour</b> <b>targeting</b> could be obtained through the association of photosensitizers with delivery vehicles which can interact preferentially or specifically with tumour cells. With this aim in mind, low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) and monoclonal antibodies, in particular, are regarded as the most promising delivery systems for anticancer drugs. Some pharmacokinetic studies with LDL-associated photosensitizers have demonstrated a higher tumour uptake compared with the same photosensitizers delivered with other formulations. Monoclonal antibody-coupled photosensitizers have been tested mainly in vitro, and have shown a high selectivity towards cells expressing specific antigens. Only a limited number of reports are available on the biodistribution of immunoconjugated photosensitizers and on their selectivity in vivo, so that their importance for the selectivity of <b>tumour</b> <b>targeting</b> has not yet been defined...|$|E

40|$|Background:Radiolabelled {{antibody}} {{targeting of}} cancer {{is limited by}} slow blood clearance. Pretargeting with a non-radiolabelled bispecific monoclonal antibody (bsMAb) followed by a rapidly clearing radiolabelled hapten peptide improves tumour localisation. The primary goals of this first pretargeting study in patients with the anti-CEACAM 5 x anti-hapten (HSG) bsMAb, TF 2, and the radiolabelled hapten-peptide, IMP 288, were to assess optimal pretargeting conditions and safety in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods:Different dose schedules were studied in four cohorts of five patients: (1) shortening the interval between the bsMAb and peptide administration (5 days vs 1 day), (2) escalating the TF 2 dose (from 75 to 150 mg), and (3) reducing the peptide dose (from 100 to 25 mug). After confirmation of <b>tumour</b> <b>targeting</b> by (111) In-IMP 288, patients were treated with a bsMAb/(177) Lu-IMP 288 cycle. Results:Rapid and selective <b>tumour</b> <b>targeting</b> of the radiolabelled peptide was visualised within 1 h, with high tumour-to-tissue ratios (> 20 at 24 h). Improved <b>tumour</b> <b>targeting</b> was achieved with a 1 -day interval between {{the administration of the}} bsMAb and the peptide and with the 25 -mug peptide dose. High (177) Lu-IMP 288 doses (2. 5 - 7. 4 GBq) were well tolerated, with some manageable TF 2 infusion reactions, and transient grades 3 - 4 thrombocytopaenia in 10 % of the patients who received (177) Lu-IMP 288. Conclusion:This phase I study demonstrates {{for the first time that}} pretargeting with bsMAb TF 2 and radiolabelled IMP 288 in patients with CEA-expressing CRC is feasible and safe.

Consequently, <b>tumour</b> <b>targeting</b> is {{required in order to}} confine this toxicity within the locality of the tumour. Bacteria have a natural capacity to grow within tumours and deliver therapeutic molecules in a controlled fashion. The non-pathogenic E. co/istrain MG 1655 was investigated as a <b>tumour</b> <b>targeting</b> system in order to produce TNF alpha specifically within murine tumours. In vivo bioluminescence imaging studies and ex vivo immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated rapid targeting dynamics and prolonged survival, replication and spread of this bacterial platform within tumours. An engineered TNF alpha producing construct deployed in mouse models via either intra-tumoural (i. t.) or intravenous (i. v.) administration facilitated robust TNF alpha production, as evidenced by ELISA of tumour extracts. Tumour growth was impeded in three subcutaneous murine tumour models (CT 26 colon, RENCA renal, and TRAMP prostate) as evidenced by tumour volume and survival analyses. A pattern of pro inflammatory cytokine induction was observed in tumours of treated mice vs. controls. Mice remained healthy throughout experiments.

In this study we used pharmacologic inhibitors to investigate the role of protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) and protein kinase C (PKC) in this process. The PTK-inhibitors herbimycin A, genistein, and methyl 2, 5 -dihydroxycinnamate blocked anti-CD 3 -activated killer T (AK-T) lymphocyte-mediated killing of <b>tumour</b> <b>target</b> cells. The PKC-inhibitors staurosporine, calphostin C, and myristoylated PKC pseudosubstrate peptide, as well as PKC desensitization by phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate pretreatment, also suppressed the cytolytic effector function of AK-T lymphocytes. Lack of tumoricidal activity was not due to reduced AK-T lymphocyte binding to <b>tumour</b> <b>target</b> cells but was associated with the abrogation of granule exocytosis, indicating that PTK and PKC are involved in the postbinding process which results in delivery of the `lethal hit' by AK-T lymphocytes. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.
