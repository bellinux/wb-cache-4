5|$|The GRC scheme {{has also}} been criticized for raising the bar for the {{opposition}} in elections. First, opposition parties may find it harder to find competent candidates, including minority candidates, to form teams to contest GRCs. Goh Chok Tong has acknowledged that the GRC scheme benefits the PAP as <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> together stronger teams. With the GRC system the threshold for votes for the opposition is also increased, and opposition parties {{have to take a}} gamble and commit huge proportions of their resources to contest GRCs. Each candidate in a GRC is required to deposit a sum equal to 8% of the total allowances payable to an MP in the calendar year preceding the election, rounded to the nearest S$500. At the 2011 general election, the deposit was $16,000. Unsuccessful candidates have their deposits forfeited if they do not receive at least one-eighth {{of the total number of}} votes polled in the GRC. Critics have noted that the number of walkovers has generally increased since the introduction of GRCs. To date, only one opposition party, the Workers' Party, has won a GRC: Aljunied, in the 2011 general election.|$|E

First, the sneakers do not need their own territories, indicating {{that they do not}} need to spend energy in protecting territories, as most other males do. Most male gobies need their own territories, since females do not choose to mate with a male that does not own his own territory. Secondly, the sneakers do not provide parental care to their eggs. The paired males provide parental care instead of the sneakers. Therefore, the sneakers can save energy, and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> more effort into finding new targets for cheating.|$|E
500|$|Speaking to The Times {{about the}} ending of the show in 1989, Curtis hinted that the {{collaborative}} writing process caused tensions amongst the cast: [...] "Everybody on the show thinks <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> in good jokes, despite the fact that Ben Elton and I think there are already quite a few good ones in there to start with. It does usually end up funnier, but it's time to do something over which I have more control." [...] Twenty years on, Curtis recalled in the documentary Blackadder Rides Again that: [...] "They would literally sit around for the entire time discussing the script...sometimes we would just say to them [...] "if you stood up and tried to act this script out, you would find out things about it." [...] Ben Elton stated that by opening it up, they allowed the cast to question every aspect of the script.|$|E

500|$|With The Legend of Zelda, Miyamoto {{wanted to}} take the idea of a game [...] "world" [...] even further, giving players a [...] "miniature garden that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> inside their drawer." [...] He drew his {{inspiration}} from his experiences as a boy around Kyoto, where he explored nearby fields, woods, and caves, and through the Zelda titles he always tries to impart to players some of the sense of exploration and limitless wonder he felt. [...] "When I was a child," [...] he said, [...] "I went hiking and found a lake. It was quite a surprise for me to stumble upon it. When I traveled around the country without a map, trying to find my way, stumbling on amazing things as I went, I realized how it felt to go on an adventure like this." [...] The memory of being lost amid the maze of sliding doors in his family's home in Sonobe was recreated in Zeldas labyrinth dungeons.|$|E
500|$|The Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System, {{referred}} to as V.A.T.S., is a new element for the Fallout series and plays {{an important part in}} combat within Fallout 3. The system was introduced by Bethesda's developers, who described it as a hybrid between timeturn-based and real-time combat, so much in that while using V.A.T.S., real-time combat is paused and action is played out from varying camera angles in a computer graphics version of [...] "bullet time". Using the system costs action points (AP), the amount of which depends on the weapon being used and thus limiting the actions of the player's combat during a turn. Through the system, the player can not only switch between multiple targets (if {{there is more than one}} around at any time), but also target specific areas of them to inflict damage – a player could either target the head for a quick kill, go for the legs to slow an enemy's movements, or shoot at their weapons to disarm them; for some enemies, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> them into a berserker rage by hitting specific parts. The chance of striking a different area, displayed as a percentage ratio, is dependent on the weapon being used, and the distance between the character and the target; a character who is a higher level when using V.A.T.S is also more likely to hit an enemy with the system than a lower level character. The use of V.A.T.S. does confer a negative effect, in that it eliminates most of the first-person shooter elements of the game; aiming is taken over by the computer, and the player is unable to move as a means of avoiding attacks. Furthermore, ranged weapons are capable of hitting limbs, while melee weapons focus on the target in whole when using V.A.T.S.|$|E

2500|$|As Nintendo {{released}} its first home video game console, the Family Computer (rereleased in North America as the Nintendo Entertainment System), Miyamoto made {{two of the}} most momentous titles for the console and in the history of video games as a whole: Super Mario Bros. (a sequel to Mario Bros.) and The Legend of Zelda (an entirely original title). In both games, Miyamoto decided to focus more on gameplay than on high scores, unlike many games of the time. Super Mario Bros. largely took a linear approach, with the player traversing the stage by running, jumping, and dodging or defeating enemies. By contrast, Miyamoto employed nonlinear gameplay in The Legend of Zelda, forcing the player to think their way through riddles and puzzles. The world was expansive and seemingly endless, offering [...] "an array of choice and depth never seen before in a video game." [...] With The Legend of Zelda, Miyamoto sought to make an in-game world that players would identify with, a [...] "miniature garden that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> inside their drawer." [...] He drew his inspiration from his experiences as a boy around Kyoto, where he explored nearby fields, woods, and caves; each Zelda title embodies this sense of exploration. [...] "When I was a child," [...] Miyamoto said, [...] "I went hiking and found a lake. It was quite a surprise for me to stumble upon it. When I traveled around the country without a map, trying to find my way, stumbling on amazing things as I went, I realized how it felt to go on an adventure like this." [...] He recreated his memories of becoming lost amid the maze of sliding doors in his family home in Zeldas labyrinthine dungeons. In February 1986, Nintendo released the game as the launch title for the Nintendo Entertainment System's new Disk System peripheral.|$|E
