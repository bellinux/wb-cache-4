5|$|Within {{the field}} of neurobiology, there are many subdisciplines that are {{concerned}} with the relations between mental and physical states and processes: Sensory neurophysiology investigates the relation between the processes of perception and stimulation. Cognitive neuroscience studies <b>the</b> <b>correlations</b> between mental processes and neural processes. Neuropsychology describes the dependence of mental faculties on specific anatomical regions of the brain. Lastly, evolutionary biology studies the origins and development of the human nervous system and, in as much as this is the basis of the mind, also describes the ontogenetic and phylogenetic development of mental phenomena beginning from their most primitive stages. Evolutionary biology furthermore places tight constraints on any philosophical theory of the mind, as the gene-based mechanism of natural selection does not allow any giant leaps in the development of neural complexity or neural software but only incremental steps over long time periods.|$|E

25|$|The field H {{is defined}} as the long {{wavelength}} Fourier components of the spin variable, in the limit that the wavelengths are long. There are many ways to take the long wavelength average, depending on the details of how high wavelengths are cut off.

Once <b>the</b> <b>correlations</b> in H are known, the long-distance correlations between the spins will be proportional to the long-distance correlations in H.|$|E
25|$|The {{variability}} of production {{from a single}} wind turbine can be high. Combining any additional number of turbines (for example, in a wind farm) results in lower statistical variation, {{as long as the}} correlation between the output of each turbine is imperfect, and <b>the</b> <b>correlations</b> are always imperfect due to the distance between each turbine.

25|$|As we {{have thus}} seen, any {{correlations}} {{seen in the}} wavefunction of each observer's minds are only concrete after interaction between the different polarizers. Even though <b>the</b> <b>correlations</b> {{on the level of}} individual minds correspond to the appearance of non-locality (or equivalently, violation of Bell's inequality). However, since the interactions only take place in individual minds they are local, since there is no real interaction between space-like separated events that could influence the minds of observers at two distant points. This, like the many worlds theory, makes the many-minds theory completely local.|$|E
25|$|For {{very high}} temperatures, the {{magnetization}} is zero, {{as it is}} at infinite temperature. To see this, note that if spin A has only a small correlation ε with spin B, and B is only weakly correlated with C, but C is otherwise independent of A, the amount of correlation of A and C goes like ε2. For two spins separated by distance L, the amount of correlation goes as εL {{but if there is}} more than one path by which <b>the</b> <b>correlations</b> can travel, this amount is enhanced by the number of paths.|$|E
25|$|From the {{description}} {{in terms of}} independent tosses, the statistics of the model for long lines can be understood. The line splits into domains. Each domain is of average length exp(2β). The length of a domain is distributed exponentially, since {{there is a constant}} probability at any step of encountering a flip. The domains never become infinite, so a long system is never magnetized. Each step reduces the correlation between a spin and its neighbor by an amount proportional to p, so <b>the</b> <b>correlations</b> fall off exponentially.|$|E

This difference favored males. In the three high ability samples, males scored higher than females in mental rotation ability.

In order for such a term to alter the finite order correlation functions, which only introduce a few new random walks into the fluctuating environment, the new paths must intersect.

But the intersection probability of random walks depends on the dimension, and random walks in dimension higher than 4 do not intersect.|$|E

25|$|Conventional {{temporal}} probabilistic models such as {{the hidden}} Markov model (HMM) and conditional random fields (CRF) model directly model <b>the</b> <b>correlations</b> between the activities and the observed sensor data. In recent years, increasing evidence has supported the use of hierarchical models which {{take into account the}} rich hierarchical structure that exists in human behavioral data. The core idea here is that the model does not directly correlate the activities with the sensor data, but instead breaks the activity into sub-activities (sometimes referred to as actions) and models the underlying correlations accordingly. An example could be the activity of preparing spaghetti, which can be broken down into the subactivities or actions of cutting vegetables, frying the vegetables in a pan and serving it on a plate. Examples of such a hierarchical model are Layered Hidden Markov Models (LHMMs) and the hierarchical hidden Markov model (HHMM), which have been shown to significantly outperform its non-hierarchical counterpart in activity recognition.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{a new approach}} for enhancing the discrimination performance of the VanderLugt correlator.
