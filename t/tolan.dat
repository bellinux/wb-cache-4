5|$|On December 31, 2008, Bellaire police {{officers}} confronted Robbie <b>Tolan,</b> {{the son of}} former Major League Baseball player Bobby <b>Tolan,</b> in the driveway of his house at the 800 block of Woodstock. Officers suspected <b>Tolan,</b> who was unarmed, of stealing a sports utility vehicle in the driveway and shot <b>Tolan</b> in the chest; Tolan's family owned the vehicle. <b>Tolan</b> was hospitalized with injuries to one lung and a liver. The incident sparked allegations of racial profiling. Members of minority groups reported that Bellaire police racially profiled people. In 2002, José Cruz, Jr., son of baseball player José Cruz, was stopped since his vehicle was missing a front license plate. He was arrested by Bellaire police and spent one night in jail after Bellaire law enforcement {{told him that he}} had a warrant for his arrest. The Houston Chronicle said that the Bellaire police decision to arrest Cruz was a mistake. In January 2009, Cruz accused the police of racial profiling. Mayor Cindy Siegel said that she was unaware of racial profiling by police. Siegel announced that the city will investigate racial profiling and hire an independent consultant to look at traffic stop data. The local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) branch said that it established a pact with the City of Bellaire; people may report civil rights violations from Bellaire Police to the branch if the people do not wish to contact the City of Bellaire. However, the NAACP branch has not yet provided the city with any civil rights violations. On April 6, 2009, a Harris County grand jury indicted Sergeant Jeffrey Cotton, the police officer, for aggravated assault by a public servant. If convicted, Cotton could face up to life in prison. In addition the family sued the police department and the police officer. The upcoming trial in Harris County District Court on criminal felony charges against Cotton began on January 25, 2010. Jury selection was scheduled to begin on May 3, 2010. The officer was found not guilty in his criminal trial in May 2010.|$|E

Their phase behavior was characterised by tplm; only the <b>tolans</b> in series 3 show liquid crystalline phases. The melting {{points of the}} <b>tolans</b> decrease with increasing chain length due to {{a higher degree of}} flexibility of the terminal chain. An odd-even effect is clearly observed for the clearing point of the nematic phase upon both heating and cooling, with the higher temperature for even and low temperature for odd number carbon chains for series 3. Monomeric and dimeric palladium dichloride complexes containing the monodentate thioureas, tetramethyl thiourea (tmtu) and a chiral C(_ 2) symmetric thiourea were synthesized. Their structures were obtained from single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The structures of the mono-palladium complexes are the trans-isomers, whereas the dimer complexes present cis-configurations, and are also the first examples of palladium complexes with sulfur-bridging thiourea ligands. NMR studies of the monomeric and dimeric complexes with tmtu reveal that, in solution, the dimeric complexes are interconverting with mono-palladium complexes, which suggests that the systems are labile. A dynamic equilibrium in solution was also observed between the rac- and meso-dipalladium complexes with the C(_ 2) -symmetric ligand. The energy barrier to exchange was obtained from a variable temperature NMR study. It is proposed that this equilibrium results from the monomer-dimer interconversion. S,N-bidentate ß-dimethyl and ß-monomethyl oxazoline thiourea ligands and α-isoquinoline thiourea ligands and their palladium complexes have been obtained. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses allow us to distinguish between some of their atropoisomers and diastereomers. Most of the Pd complexes were shown to be monomers in the solid state, although one ligand with a cyclohexyl group formed exclusively dimers, and one formed a trimer, as well as a monomer, depending on the solvent mixture that the crystals were grown from. The ligands were found to coordinate through their S and N atoms. All of the mono-palladium complexes and most of the dimers have cis-configurations at the Pd centers; however, we also found a trans-configuration in the trimer and the dimer of one of the palladium complex of the ß-monomethyl ligands. The structures show that the ß- monomethyl oxazoline and a-isoquinoline thiourea complexes appear to be more weakly coordinated than the ß-dimethyl oxazoline ones which may be responsible for their lower stabilities in solution. The structure of the ligands (in particular the 'up' or 'down' conformation of the atropoisomers) is intimately related to their enatioselectivities in bis(methoxycarbonylation) reactions of styrene using palladium complexes. The ß-dimethyl ligands were, in general, found to be more selective in this reaction than the ß -monomethyl oxazoline ones, with palladium complexes of the latter generally found to be less stable in NMR studies. Several bis(phosphine) monosulfide and disulfide ligands and their palladium complexes have been synthesized and analyzed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The reaction with 1 : 1 molar ratios of Pd source to monosulfide ligands were found to produce monomeric palladium complexes with chelating ligands, apart from the reaction with is(diphenylphosphino) butane monosulfide, which was found to result in a dimer being formed. The reactions with 1 : 2 molar ratios of Pd source to monosulfide ligand gave complexes which were coordinated only through the phosphine groups, except for that with bis(diphenylphosphino) methane monosulfides which formed cafionic palladium complexes with two chelating ligands. Analogous reactions with the disulfide ligands and the Pd source [Pd(CH(_ 3) CN) (_ 4) ](BF(_ 4)) (_ 2) also resulted in cationic Pd complexes incorporating two chelating ligands. In some cases, in solution, the complexes showed dynamic equilibria between cis- and trans- isomers which suggests that the phosphine sulfide ligands are labile. The Pd-S-P angles in the complexes were found to be variable but, since there are none less than 90, it is unlikely that there is any ƞ(^ 2) -π bonding involving the P=S bond. Preliminary results show that the activities of phosphine sulfide palladium complexes in the oxidative homo-coupling of phenylacetylene are comparable to that of the commonly used pre-catalyst, PdCl(_ 2) (PPh(_ 3)) (_ 2) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} -substituted- 4 -(4 -trimethylsilanylethynyl-phenylethynyl) benzenes (4 a-e) have been {{prepared}} via Pd(^ 1 ’") /Cu(^ 1) -catalysed cross-coupling of 1 -iodo- or bromo-p-substituted benzenes with l-(trimethylsilylethynyl) - 4 -ethynyl benzene (3). Deprotection by removal of the TMS from compounds (4 a-e) was used to obtain p-ethynyl <b>tolans</b> with different functional groups (5 a-e) at the other para position. A number of new symmetrical conjugated diynes (6 a-e) were formed by homocoupling of the terminal alkynes (5 a-e). A Harnett plot λ(_masx) (Abs) versus Hammet constants Cp for compounds (4 a-e), (5 a-e) and (6 a-e) showed that both donors and acceptors red shift absorption. Also, diynes have been synthesised from esters containing a long chain aliphatic group to improve solubility. Thus, 4 -bromobenzoic acid was reacted with octan- 1 -ої to obtain 4 - bromobenzoic acid octyl ester, 7, which has a Cg chain and a Br group in the preposition for subsequent coupling reactions. Then compound 7 was used in two pathways. In path A, compound 7 was coupled with TMSA to obtain the protected alkyne, 8. Then the TMS protecting group was removed under mild condition to give the terminal alkyne, 9, which was oxidatively homocoupled to give diyne, 10. In path B， compound 7 was coupled with compound 3 to give 4 -(4 - trimethylsilanylethynylphenylethynyl) benzoic acid octyl ester, 11. The next step was deprotection of 11 to form the terminal alkyne 12.

40|$|This work investigates {{two main}} areas of interest. The {{first is the}} {{synthesis}} and study {{of a variety of}} Lewis acid-Lewis base adducts of general formula X(_ 3) B-PR(_ 3) (X = CI, Br; R= alkyl or aryl). The (^ 11) B-P and (^ 10) B-P NMR coupling phenomena are investigated. The partial dissociation of some of these compounds in solution is probed by (^ 31) P and (^ 11) B NMR. The crystal structures of many of these compounds are presented and analysed for correlations between the properties of the phosphines and B P bond length. It was found that only the Tolman cone angle gave a good correlation to B P bond length. A compound containing a novel B 2 O 2 ring was synthesised during these studies, and theoretical calculations performed to gain an insight into the planarity of this unusual 4 - membered ring. The first crystallographically characterised example of the tri(o-toly) phosphonium cation is also presented. The related compounds X(_ 3) B pyridine, X(_ 3) B- 2 -picoline and X(_ 3) B 4 -picohne (X = CI, Br) are investigated by various analytical methods. Crystal structures of these B-N adducts are presented. It is found that the structure of CI 3 B 4 -picoline exhibits an interesting phase transition from orthorhombic Pnma at higher temperatures to monoclinic space group P 2 i/n below ca. 170 K. The second area of work involves crystal structure analyses of a variety of co-crystals of his(phenylethynyl) benzene compounds, of general type R-Ph-CC-Ph-CC-Ph-R, with R = H, F, MeO, MeS, CH 3 and CF 3 and a varying fluorinadon pattern on the phenyl rings. The effect of these para substituents on the arene-peifluoroarene interaction was investigated. The effect of each substituent was found to be subtle. In most cases, the co-crystallisation induced an arene-perfluoroarene interaction that was not present in the individual components. Starting materials for the bis(phenylethynyl) benzene compounds often include halogenated <b>tolans</b> of the form Ph-CC-Ph-X (X = CI, Br, I), with either the halogenated or the non-halogenated ring fluorinated. Crystal structures of PhF(_ 5) -CC-Ph-X (X = I, Br, CI), Ph-CC-PhF 4 -I and Ph-CC-PhF 4 -CC-SiMe 3 are presented and the arene- perfluoroarene interaction investigated. It is found that the PhPg-CC-Ph-X (X = I and Br) compounds show no evidence of the interaction. The dominating intermolecular force is a Type n halogen -halogen short contact. In contrast, the structure of the chloro analogue is dominated by the arene-perfluoroarene interaction, with no halogen -halogen short contacts. Neither intermolecular force is present in the Ph-CC- PhF(_ 4) -I or Ph-CC-PhF(_ 4) -CC-SiMe(_ 3) structures...|$|R

The compounds absorb {{strongly in the}} range 453 - 544 nm, and are photoluminescent, in solution at room temperature, emitting in the range 496 - 631 nm with singlet lifetimes and quantum yields of 3 - 18 %. The photophysical properties are strongly influenced {{by the nature of}} R, but appear to be almost independent of the acetylide used; the latter is related to unfavourable steric interactions. Acceptor R groups red-shift both absorption and emission much more significantly than donor groups. A number of the structures have been solved by single crystal X-ray diffraction and the structures are compared and contrasted. Analogous compounds with X = Me and СІ have also been prepared. The absorbance properties are similar to the acetylide-substituted derivatives, although absorption maxima are slightly shifted to lower energy. Also correlated with this are the values of J(_Rh-P) for the sets of compounds which surprisingly suggest better donating ability of both Me and СІ over the acetylides. The СІ compound is luminescent, its emission maximum again shifted to lower energy from that of the acetylide examples. In stark contrast to the acetylide and СІ rhodacycle derivatives, the Me compounds are not emissive at room temperature in solution. The rhodacycles react slowly, with additional diyne only under forcing conditions, to form highly substituted benzenes. It is shown that the rhodacycles can catalyse the regiospecific cyclotrimerisation of 1, 4 -bis(4 -R-phenyl) buta- 1, 3 -diynes to give l, 2, 4 -tris(4 - R-phenylethynyl) - 2, 5, 6 -tri(4 -R-phenyl) benzenes exclusively. The activity of the rhodacycles as catalysts for trimerisation are low, but due to the 2, 5 - selectivity of the rhodacycle formation, the reaction is regiospecific. The cyclotrimers are luminescent and the photophysical properties have been studied. The single-crystal X-ray structure for the parent cyclotrimer, l, 2, 4 -tris(phenylethynyl) - 2, 5, 6 -tri(phenyl) benzene, has been obtained and is discussed. The mechanism for rhodacycle formation has been probed. A number of Rh-diyne π-complexes, in which one of the diyne C≡C bonds is coordinated to Rh, which were observed as intermediates during rhodacycle syntheses, have been isolated and characterised. 1 H, (^ 19) F{(^ 1) H} and (^ 31) P{(^ 1) H} NMR spectroscopy has been used to propose a general structure, and several related Rh- π -complexes of symmetrical and unsymmetrical <b>tolans</b> have been prepared to support this, some of which have been characterised by X-ray diffraction and are discussed. The crystal structures of two solvates of the unusual centrosymmetric bimetallic complex, [Rh(PMe(_ 3)) (_ 3) (Cl) ](μ-(1, 2 -ƞ(^ 2)) :(3, 4 - ƞ(^ 2)) - 4 -F (_ 3) C-C(_ 6) H(_ 4) -C≡C-C≡C-C(_ 6) H(_ 4) - 4 -CF(_ 3)) have also been obtained.

She also alleges that the Quran associates Jews with interconfessional strife and rivalry (...) , the Jewish belief that they alone are beloved of God (...) , and that only they will achieve salvation (...) [...] According to the Encyclopedia Judaica, the Qur'an contains many attacks on Jews and Christians for their refusal to recognize Muhammad as a prophet. In the Muslim view, the crucifixion of Jesus was an illusion, and thus the Jewish plots against him ended in failure. In numerous verses the Qur'an accuses Jews of altering the Scripture. [...] Karen Armstrong {{claims that the}}re are [...] "far more numerous passages in the Qur'an" [...] which speak positively of the Jews and their great |prophets, than those which were against the [...] "rebellious Jewish tribes of Medina" [...] (during Muhammad's time). Sayyid Abul Ala believes the punishments were not meant for all Jews, {{and that they were}} only meant for the Jewish inhabitants that were sinning at the time. According to historian John <b>Tolan,</b> the Quran contains a verse which criticizes the Christian worship of Jesus Christ as a God, amongst other critiques of Jewish and Christian practices and doctrines. Despite this, the Quran has high praise for these religions, regarding them as the other two parts of the Abrahamic trinity.|$|E
