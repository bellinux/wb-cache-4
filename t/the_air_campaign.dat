5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>campaign</b> continued, the Coalition's {{expectations}} of an Iraqi offensive decreased. As a result, the United States redeployed the XVIII Airborne Corps and the VII Corps 480kilometers (300mi) to the west. The Coalition's leadership believed that should an Iraqi force {{go on the}} offensive, it would be launched from the al-Wafra oil fields, in Southern Kuwait.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{debate over the}} {{morality}} of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>campaign</b> against Japan since World WarII. During the war the American public approved of the bombing of Germany and Japan, and {{the few people who}} criticized the raids were seen as unrealistic or even traitors. Some United States government and military personnel believed that the bombing campaign was morally ambiguous, however, but rarely voiced their views publicly.|$|E
5|$|Despite these Iraqi threats, the Coalition {{launched}} a 38-day aerial campaign on 17 January 1991. Flying an estimated 2,000 sorties a day, Coalition aircraft rapidly crippled the Iraqi air defense systems and effectively destroyed the Iraqi Air Force, whose daily sortie rate plummeted from a prewar level {{of an estimated}} 200 per day to almost none by 17 January. On {{the third day of}} the campaign, many Iraqi pilots fled across the Iranian border in their aircraft rather than be destroyed. <b>The</b> <b>air</b> <b>campaign</b> also targeted command-and-control sites, bridges, railroads, and petroleum storage facilities.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>campaign,</b> {{a small number}} of Australians took part in special operations ahead of the invasion. In January 1944, RANVR officer Lieutenant Ken Hudspeth, who commanded the midget submarine , transported a party of specialist personnel to inspect and collect soil samples from French beaches being considered for the invasion. This operation was successful, and earned Hudspeth his second Distinguished Service Cross (DSC). Nancy Wake, an Australian serving with the British Special Operations Executive, was parachuted into France in April 1944 and subsequently helped to organise the French Resistance in the Auvergne region.|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{argued that}} among the Vietnamese forces {{involved}} {{in the civil war}} there were nationalists opposed to foreign military intervention. He opposed many of the strategies associated with troop escalation, notably <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>campaign</b> over North Vietnam, which he saw as an aggressive measure causing civilian casualties that could draw the People's Republic of China or the Soviet Union into the conflict. He also feared that other American interests, including the economy, were suffering through U.S. involvement in the war, and that the U.S. was losing prestige internationally.|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffe was to {{spearhead}} {{the aerial}} {{battle in the}} low countries. Its first task was {{the elimination of the}} Belgian air contingent. Despite an overwhelming numerical superiority of 1,375 aircraft, 957 of which were serviceable, <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>campaign</b> in Belgium had limited success overall on the first day. At roughly 04:00, the first air raids were conducted against airfields and communication centres. It still had a tremendous impact on the AéMI, which had only 179 aircraft on 10 May.|$|E

5|$|The USAAF {{assessed}} {{that the}} firebombing campaign had been highly successful, {{and noted that}} American losses during these attacks were much lower than those incurred during day precision raids. Accordingly, the Joint Target Group (JTG), which was the Washington, D.C.-based organisation responsible for developing strategies for <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>campaign</b> against Japan, developed plans for a two-stage campaign against 22 Japanese cities. The JTG also recommended that precision bombing attacks on particularly important industrial facilities continue in parallel to the area raids, however. While this campaign was intended to form part of preparations for the Allied invasion of Japan, LeMay and some members of Arnold's staff believed that it alone would be sufficient to force the country's surrender.|$|E
5|$|The {{end result}} of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>campaign</b> against Britain in 1940 and 1941 was a decisive failure to end the war. As Hitler {{committed}} Germany to ever increasing military adventures, the Wehrmacht became increasingly overstretched {{and was unable to}} cope with a multi-front war. By 1944, the Allies were ready to launch Operation Overlord, the invasion of Western Europe. The Battle of Britain ensured that the Western Allies had a base from which to launch the campaign and {{that there would be a}} Western Allied presence on the battlefield to meet the Soviet Red Army in central Europe at the end of the war in May 1945.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 28 January, the Coalition {{received}} {{a number of}} warnings suggesting an impending Iraqi offensive. The Coalition was flying two brand-new E-8A Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS) aircraft, which picked up the deployment and movement of Iraqi forces to the area opposite of Khafji. Observation posts 2, 7 and 8 also detected heavy Iraqi reconnoitering along the border, and their small teams of air-naval gunfire liaison Marines called in air and artillery strikes throughout the day. Lieutenant Colonel Richard Barry, commander of the forward headquarters of the 1st Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Intelligence Group, sent warnings about an impending attack to Central Command. CentCom leaders were too preoccupied with <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>campaign</b> to heed them however, and so the Iraqi operation came as a surprise.|$|E

5|$|Having {{failed to}} defeat the RAF, the Luftwaffe adopted a {{different}} and clearer strategy of strategic bombing known as The Blitz. However, as with the campaign against the RAF, the types of targets differed radically and no sustained pressure was put under any one type of British target. Disputes among the OKL staff revolved more around tactics than strategy. This method condemned the offensive over Britain to failure before it had even begun. The end result of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>campaign</b> against Britain in 1940 and 1941 was a decisive failure to end the war.

5|$|The {{squadron}} re-equipped with CAC Sabres at Williamtown in November 1956. Two {{years later}} it transferred to RAAF Butterworth in Malaya to join <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>campaign</b> against communist guerrillas {{in the last}} stages of the Emergency. The squadron remained at Butterworth during the 1960s, providing regional air defence during the Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia. It returned to Williamtown in early 1969 to re-equip with Dassault MirageIII supersonic jet fighters. No.77 Squadron began converting to Hornets in June 1987. It supplied a detachment of four aircraft to the American base on Diego Garcia in 2001–02, supporting the war in Afghanistan, and deployed to the Middle East {{as part of the}} military intervention against ISIL in 2015–16. Along with its Hornets, the squadron briefly operated Pilatus PC-9s in the forward air control role in the early 2000s. The RAAF plans to replace its Hornets with Lockheed Martin F-35 LightningII fighters commencing in 2018, and No.77 Squadron is scheduled to convert to the new type in 2021.|$|E
5|$|From early April 1965, Ubon {{became an}} {{important}} base for United States Air Force (USAF) attacks on North Vietnam during the Vietnam War, and No.79 Squadron became part of an integrated air defence system controlled by the USAF on 25June. This changed {{the status of the}} squadron's presence in Thailand, and RAAF Headquarters assessed that the North Vietnamese would be justified in regarding it as forming part of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>campaign</b> against their country. Due to the threat of counter-attacks on Ubon, the base's ground defences were upgraded during 1966; this included the construction of defensive positions for No.79 Squadron's aircraft and personnel as well as the deployment of a detachment of RAAF airfield defence guards. While the squadron did not play {{an active role in the}} war, it supported the US effort by providing air defence for Ubon and taking part in exercises with USAF aircraft in which the Sabres adopted tactics used by North Vietnamese MiG-17 fighters. In December 1965 the commander of the United States Pacific Air Forces, General Hunter Harris, Jr., wrote to the chief of the RAAF, Air Marshal Alister Murdoch, to suggest that No.79 Squadron join the USAF operations against the Ho Chi Minh trail in southern Laos which were being covertly conducted by Ubon-based aircraft. The Thai Government indicated that it would allow the squadron to be used for this purpose as long as the Australian operations were conducted without a formal agreement or any public announcement. On 2March 1966 the Australian Cabinet decided to reinforce the Army and RAAF force in South Vietnam, but rejected the option of expanding the scope of RAAF operations in Thailand. This decision was made on the grounds that the expanded force in South Vietnam and existing deployments to Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore represented the maximum forces Australia could commit to the region.|$|E
