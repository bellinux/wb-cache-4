Its range extends into Siberia, China and southwest Asia {{in the mountains of}} northern Turkey, the Caucasus and northern Iran.

5|$|Both {{real and}} fictitious plants play {{a wide variety}} of roles in {{literature}} and film. Plants' roles may be evil, as with the triffids, carnivorous plants with a whip-like poisonous sting as well as mobility provided by three foot-like appendages, from John Wyndham's 1951 science fiction novel The Day of the Triffids, and subsequent films and radio plays. J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth makes use of many named kinds of plant, including the healing herb athelas the yellow star-flower elanor which grows in special places such as Cerin Amroth in Lothlórien, and the tall mallorn tree of the elves. Tolkien names several individual trees of significance in the narrative, including the Party <b>Tree</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire with its happy associations, and the malevolent Old Man Willow in the Old Forest.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to higher}} {{elevation}} and precipitation, {{the ecology of}} the Black Hills differs significantly from that of the plains. The mountains are thickly blanketed by coniferous needleleaf evergreens: various types of pines—including ponderosa (covering , or 80% of the Black Hills forest), lodgepole, white, and timber—as well as western red cedar and spruces. Western yellow ponderosa is the most important lumber <b>tree</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. The South Dakota state tree is the Black Hills spruce. The Red Valley is home to blue-joint and bluegrasses, and wild plum, Juneberry, and chokecherry shrubs grow in the Hills. Violets, thistles, and horse mint are prevalent herbs. Vines grow widely: the woodbine, bittersweet, and wild grape, which is the pattern for Black Hills gold jewelry.|$|E
