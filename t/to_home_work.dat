30|$|The {{accuracy}} of both the Gravity Model and the Radiation Model depends {{on the ability to}} accurately model, for a given time epoch, movement from any region to any other region, and lack of movement to another region. Inter-region movements are driven by opportunities and resources, which are reflected in the population of region, and constrained by distance. Intra-region affinities, such as physical proximity <b>to</b> <b>home,</b> <b>work,</b> family, and friends, tend to limit movement from a given region. Improperly partitioning a region to account these affinities results in over or under predicting flux, and therefore, poor model performance.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine a}} very {{large-scale}} data set {{of more than}} 30 bil-lion call records made by 25 million cell phone users across all 50 states of the US and attempt to determine to what extent anonymized location data can reveal private user in-formation. Our approach is to infer, from the call records, the “top N ” locations for each user and correlate this in-formation with publicly-available side information such as census data. For example, the measured “top 2 ” locations likely correspond to home and work locations, the “top 3 ” <b>to</b> <b>home,</b> <b>work,</b> and shopping/school/commute path locations. We consider the cases where those “top N ” locations are measured with different levels of granularity, ranging from a cell sector to whole cell, zip code, city, county and state. We then compute the anonymity set, namely the number o...|$|E
40|$|Accessibility to {{gambling}} {{has been}} linked to gambling behaviour but remains poorly understood. This study used data from semi-structured focus groups and interviews with 38 participants (Median age 42 years) to explore wider aspects of accessibility. People preferred venues which were open long hours and located close <b>to</b> <b>home,</b> <b>work</b> or regular routes, i. e., geo-temporal accessibility. This was particularly influential for problem gamblers. Social and personal accessibility related to venues as safe, social, easy entertainment experiences, and as an accessible retreat from life issues. The attraction of an accessible retreat was restricted to problem gamblers. Finally, low outlay games and easy access to money increased financial accessibility. Accessibility should therefore be considered multidimensional. Further, results suggested that while gambling as safe, social entertainment may be relatively harmless, the attraction of geo-temporal accessibility and a retreat from problems may encourage excessive gambling in some individual...|$|E

40|$|Based on {{in-vehicle}} GPS travel {{data in the}} Minneapolis - St. Paul Metropolitan Area, {{this research}} investigates how land use, road network structure, and route familiarity influence home-based single-destination choice. We propose a new choice set formation approach which combines survival analysis and random selection. Our empirical findings reveal that: (1) Walkable opportunities and diversity of services at the destination influence destination choice. (2) Route-specific network measures such as turn index and speed discontinuity display statistically significant effects on destination choice. (3) The familiarity factors reflected by distance <b>to</b> <b>home,</b> <b>work,</b> and downtown also plays a role. A destination closer to home and work, all else equal, {{is more likely to}} be selected. A destination farther away from downtown is more attractive for auto users. This research contributes to methodologies in modeling destination choice using GPS data. The results enhance our understanding of non-work travel behavior and have implications for transportation and land use planning...|$|E
30|$|Results from time-series {{studies in}} {{developed}} economies also support the U-shaped hypothesis. Goldin found initial {{evidence of the}} U-shape relation in {{a study on the}} US (Goldin, 1995). These results were confirmed in more recent studies (Goldin, 2004, 2006, Olivetti, 2013) that were also able to pinpoint five distinct phases characterizing the evolution of FPRs in the US. The first phase (“The independent female worker”, up to the 1920 s) saw the entrance of young and low educated women into the labor force, mostly in poorly paid or non-paid occupations followed by a subsequent exit from the labor force explained by marriage and the shift <b>to</b> <b>home</b> <b>work.</b> In a second phase (1930 s- 1950) married women start to join the labor force due to the increased demand in clerical jobs and the increased level in female education. In the third phase (1950 s- 1970 s), FPRs go through a real revolution, with rapid increases explained by better education of women, rising wages and the introduction of more flexible working arrangements such as part-time work.|$|E
40|$|This study quantifies the {{motivators}} {{and barriers}} to bikeshare program usage in Australia. An online survey {{was administered to}} a sample of annual members of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s two bikeshare programs based in Brisbane and Melbourne, to assess motivations for joining the schemes. Non-members of the programs were also sampled in order to identify current barriers to joining bikeshare. Spatial analysis from Brisbane revealed residential and work locations of non-members were more geographically dispersed than for bikeshare members. An analysis of bikeshare usage in Melbourne showed a strong relationship between docking stations in areas with relatively less accessible public transit opportunities. The most influential barriers to bikeshare use related to motorized travel being too convenient and docking stations not being sufficiently close <b>to</b> <b>home,</b> <b>work</b> and other frequented destinations. The findings suggest that bikeshare programs may attract increased membership by ensuring travel times are competitive with motorized travel, for example through efficient bicycle routing and priority progression and, by expanding docking station locations, and by increasing the level of convenience associated with scheme use. Convenience considerations may include strategic location of docking stations, ease of signing up and integration with public transport...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} examine from an {{employee}} perspective, the promises made {{on behalf of}} telework as a new work practice. We are especially concerned with the relationship between gender and telework in relation <b>to</b> <b>home</b> <b>work</b> boundaries, since gender roles in society are largely shaped by home and family. Drawing on management and organisation studies, {{in the first half}} of the paper we develop a critique of proposed advantages for women home workers by deconstructing the set of benefits which are said to be delivered by this new socio-technological ensemble. Having once outlined the problems to which teleworking is posed as the solution, an alternative set of issues are generated by recourse to existing literature on women and information technology. In the second part of the paper, we then move to construct an alternative research agenda which is focused to provide a more thorough-going review of concerns faced by employee’s working at home, using information and communication technologies, and at a distance from the host organization. The re-orientation on employee-centred priorities is enhanced by engaging with current writings on the changing nature of work identities in the risk society. In conclusion, we underline the contribution of this paper and the research agenda for IS research and for those agencies engaged in ameliorating employees rights a...|$|E
40|$|Policymakers {{devote a}} great deal of {{attention}} to short-run fluctuations in the labor market. Central banks monitor indicators of labor market tightness in the conduct of monetary policy due to the potential implications for inflation. And fiscal authorities are concerned with the budget consequences of fluctuations in the labor market because they affect both revenues and expenditure programs. More generally, these fluctuations may be associated with significant losses in welfare.; This article stems from a striking empirical observation about long-run variations in labor market outcomes: Long-run changes in total hours of work in OECD countries exceed the variation of hours worked over the business cycle in a representative country (say, the United States) by almost an order of magnitude. If understanding changes in hours of work of the magnitude of business cycle fluctuations is an important policy concern, then understanding the sources of these trend differences is also crucial. Surprisingly, the academic and policy debates have focused on the business cycle movements in the labor market, almost ignoring low frequency changes.; Lee Ohanian, Andrea Raffo, and Richard Rogerson describe the steep decline in average hours worked and the large variation across countries in the magnitude of this decline. Next, they find that changes in labor taxes account for a large share of the trend differences. Finally, they find that countries with high tax rates devote less time to market work, but more time to home activities, such as cooking and cleaning. Moreover, this reallocation of time from market work <b>to</b> <b>home</b> <b>work</b> is much stronger for females than for males. Taxation; Labor market; Hours of labor...|$|E
