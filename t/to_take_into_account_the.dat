5|$|Events of {{the later}} years of the reign showed that Constantinople itself was not safe from barbarian incursions from the north, and even the {{relatively}} benevolent historian Menander Protector {{felt the need to}} attribute the Emperor's failure to protect the capital to the weakness of his body in his old age. In his efforts to renew the Roman Empire, Justinian dangerously stretched its resources while failing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>the</b> changed realities of 6th-century Europe.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 the State Historic Preservation Board {{considered}} a boundary adjustment that removes {{a small area}} at the northeast corner but adds far more, primarily at the southeast. It would include a total of 200 new contributing properties and extend the district's period of significance to 1978, <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>the</b> city's urban renewal era. Most of the new areas had {{been found to be}} consistent with those already included in the district or accidentally excluded when the district was originally designated. Two years later the National Park Service officially approved the expansion.|$|E
5|$|Primarily {{starting}} in the mid-1960s, London became a centre for the worldwide youth culture, exemplified by the Swinging London subculture associated with the King's Road, Chelsea and Carnaby Street.

5|$|The breed {{is popular}} for {{recreational}} and competitive driving, {{to which it}} is well suited in temperament. In 1997, the rules of driving events in France were modified <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>the</b> speed of execution of the course, which made lighter, faster horses more competitive. The Norman Cob and the lighter type of Boulonnais were particularly affected. The Norman Cob's gaits, calm temperament and willingness to master technical movements make it an excellent competitor, and in 2011, {{more than a third of}} the horses represented in the French driving championships were Norman Cobs. Many Norman Cobs represent France in driving events at the international level.|$|E
5|$|These {{computations}} all {{assume that}} the white dwarf is non-rotating. If the white dwarf is rotating, the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium must be modified <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>the</b> centrifugal pseudo-force arising from working in a rotating frame. For a uniformly rotating white dwarf, the limiting mass increases only slightly. If the star is allowed to rotate nonuniformly, and viscosity is neglected, then, as was pointed out by Fred Hoyle in 1947, there is no limit to the mass {{for which it is}} possible for a model white dwarf to be in static equilibrium. Not all of these model stars will be dynamically stable.|$|E
5|$|When Freddy Mike's {{statement}} {{became known}} to the public, various petitions and campaigns to free Williams were organised throughout the country. A petition containing 35,000 signatures requesting a reprieve {{was sent to the}} Home Secretary. As soon as the House of Commons opened on 23 January 1913, McKenna was questioned by Labour, Conservative, and Liberal MPs. Robert Munro, MP for Wick Burghs, made a speech asking the Home Secretary <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>the</b> conflicting accounts, lack of any direct evidence, and the way the judge had directed the jury, and pardon Williams. In this he was supported by Will Crooks, the Marquess of Tullibardine, and Ian Macpherson.|$|E

5|$|Although {{absolute}} {{in theory}} and in principle, the sultan's powers were limited in practice. Political decisions had <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>the</b> opinions and attitudes of important members of the dynasty, the bureaucratic and military establishments, as well as religious leaders. Beginning in the last decades of the sixteenth century, {{the role of the}} Ottoman sultans in the government of the empire began to decrease, in a period known as the Transformation of the Ottoman Empire. Despite being barred from inheriting the throne, women of the Imperial Harem—especially the reigning sultan's mother, known as the Valide Sultan—also played an important behind-the-scenes political role, effectively ruling the empire during the period known as the Sultanate of Women.|$|E
5|$|International {{treaties}} may {{be necessary}} for such objectives as the setting up of marine reserves. Another international agreement, the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, protects animals that migrate across the globe and need protection {{in more than one}} country. However, the protection of habitats needs <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>the</b> needs of the local residents for food, fuel and other resources. Even where legislation protects the environment, a lack of enforcement often prevents effective protection. Faced with food shortage, a farmer is likely to plough up a level patch of ground despite it being the last suitable habitat for an endangered species such as the San Quintin kangaroo rat, and even kill the animal as a pest. In this regard, it is desirable to educate the community on the uniqueness of their flora and fauna and the benefits of ecotourism.|$|E
5|$|Other Marxists, such as George Derwent Thomson and Neil Faulkner, {{have argued}} that Childe's archaeological work should not {{correctly}} be considered Marxist because he failed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>the</b> existence of class struggle {{as an instrument of}} social change, something which was a core tenet of Marxist thought. While class struggle was not a factor he considered in his archaeological work, Childe did accept that historians and archaeologists typically interpreted the past through their own class interests, and that most of his contemporaries were producing studies with an innate bourgeois agenda. Childe also diverged from orthodox Marxism by not employing dialectics in his methodology. Furthermore, he denied Marxism's ability to predict the future development of human society, and did not consider humanity's development into pure communism to be inevitable, instead opining that society could fossilize or become extinct instead.|$|E

5|$|Scholarship in {{the area}} of Jewish Christian studies has tended to be based on {{artificial}} constructs similar to those developed by the early Christian heresiologists, with the underlying assumption that all of the beliefs and practices of these groups were based on theology. This has led to the perpetuation of ideological definitions that fail <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>the</b> pluriformity of these groups, reflecting differences in geography, time periods in history, and ethnicity. With respect to Epiphanius, and the Ebionites in particular, insufficient {{attention has been paid to}} the highly speculative nature of his theological constructs and his mixing together of disparate sources, including his use of a gospel harmony that may have had nothing to do with the Ebionite sect known to Irenaeus. In the end, he presents an enigmatic picture of the Ebionites and their place in early Christian history.|$|E
5|$|The Bulgarians, using {{information}} from escaped prisoners of war, determined that Entente forces would engage in hostile actions west of lake Ohrid, in Monastir, Dobro Pole or Human. On 27 August, the 2nd and 3rd Bulgarian divisions stationed at Dobro Pole {{were ordered to}} make emergency preparations, as new evidence indicated a frontal assault on Dobro Pole along with a secondary attack on Human. By 7 September, Dobro Pole was reinforced by one machine gun company, six battalions and ten heavy howitzers, General Friedrich von Scholtz then stated that the defensive measures made {{the defense of the}} front feasible. Von Scholtz had, however, failed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>the</b> departure of Bulgarian chief of staff Nikola Zhekov and his subsequent replacement by Georgi Todorov. Widespread insubordination and desertions also plagued the Bulgarian troops who refused to participate in fortification works. Poor rations and fatigue contributed to the low morale.|$|E
5|$|While these {{specific}} failings {{came back to}} haunt the Empire in subsequent decades, perhaps the greatest weakness of the Peace of Augsburg was its failure <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>the</b> growing diversity of religious expression emerging in the evangelical (Lutheran) and Reformed traditions. Other confessions had acquired popular, if not legal, legitimacy in the intervening decades and by 1555, the reforms proposed by Luther were no longer the only possibilities of religious expression: Anabaptists, such as the Frisian Menno Simons (1492–1559) and his followers; the followers of John Calvin, who were particularly strong in the southwest and the northwest; and the followers of Huldrych Zwingli were excluded from considerations and protections under the Peace of Augsburg. According to the Augsburg agreement, their religious beliefs remained heretical.|$|E

5|$|The first {{project to}} {{describe}} {{the shape of the}} Milky Way and the position of the Sun was undertaken by William Herschel in 1785 by counting the number of stars in different regions of the sky. He produced a diagram of the shape of the galaxy with the Solar System close to the center. Using a refined approach, Kapteyn in 1920 arrived at the picture of a small (diameter about 15kiloparsecs) ellipsoid galaxy with the Sun close to the center. A different method by Harlow Shapley based on the cataloguing of globular clusters led to a radically different picture: a flat disk with diameter approximately 70kiloparsecs and the Sun far from the center. Both analyses failed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>the</b> absorption of light by interstellar dust present in the galactic plane, but after Robert Julius Trumpler quantified this effect in 1930 by studying open clusters, the present picture of our host galaxy, the Milky Way, emerged.|$|E
5|$|When {{the shuffle}} format was introduced, the Hot Seats and {{corresponding}} monitors were {{replaced with a}} single podium, and as a result, the contestant and host stand throughout the game and are also able {{to walk around the}} stage. Also, two video screens were installed–one that displays the current question in play, and another that displays the contestant's cumulative total and progress during the game. In September 2012, the redesigned set was improved with a modernized look and feel, in order <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>the</b> show's transition to high-definition broadcasting, which had just come about the previous year. The two video screens were replaced with two larger ones, having twice as many projectors as the previous screens had; the previous contestant podium was replaced with a new one; and light-emitting diode (LED) technology was integrated into the lighting system to give the lights more vivid colors and the set and gameplay experience a more intimate feel.|$|E
