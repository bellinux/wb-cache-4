5|$|The rough idea {{of these}} inapproximability results is {{to form a}} graph that {{represents}} a probabilistically checkable proof system for an NP-complete problem such as the Boolean satisfiability problem. In a probabilistically checkable proof system, a proof is represented as a sequence of bits. An instance of the satisfiability problem should have a valid proof {{if and only if}} it is satisfiable. <b>The</b> <b>proof</b> is checked by an algorithm that, after a polynomial-time computation on the input to the satisfiability problem, chooses to examine a small number of randomly chosen positions of <b>the</b> <b>proof</b> string. Depending on what values are found at that sample of bits, the checker will either accept or reject <b>the</b> <b>proof,</b> without looking at the rest of the bits. False negatives are not allowed: a valid proof must always be accepted. However, an invalid proof may sometimes mistakenly be accepted. For every invalid proof, the probability that the checker will accept it must be low.|$|E

25|$|It {{is common}} for a theorem to be preceded by {{definitions}} describing the exact meaning of the terms used in the theorem. It is also common for a theorem to be preceded {{by a number of}} propositions or lemmas which are then used in <b>the</b> <b>proof.</b> However, lemmas are sometimes embedded in <b>the</b> <b>proof</b> of a theorem, either with nested proofs, or with their proofs presented after <b>the</b> <b>proof</b> of the theorem.|$|E
