5|$|Following {{the final}} orchestral crescendo, the song ends {{with one of}} the most famous final chords in music history. Overdubbed in place of the vocal {{experiment}} from 10 February, this chord was added during a session at EMI's Studio Two on 22 February. Lennon, McCartney, Starr and Evans shared three different pianos, with Martin on a harmonium, and all played an E-major chord simultaneously. The chord was made to ring out for over forty seconds by increasing the recording sound level as <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> faded out. Towards the end of the chord the recording level was so high that listeners can hear the sounds of the studio, including rustling papers and a squeaking chair.|$|E

Prototype #9 also received an upgraded transmission and drivetrain, and a hinged rear canopy in place of the original sliding canopy around 1970. The new transmission allowed the T64-GE-16 turboshaft engine output to be increased from a derated 3,435horsepower (2,561kW) to 3,925horsepower (2,927kW). The new canopy eliminated the canopy vibrations.|$|E
5|$|Sound that {{travels through}} the outer ear {{impacts on the}} eardrum, and causes it to vibrate. The three {{ossicles}} bones transmit this sound to a second window (the oval window) which protects the fluid-filled inner ear. In detail, the pinna of the outer ear helps to focus a sound, which impacts on the eardrum. The malleus rests on the membrane, and receives <b>the</b> <b>vibration.</b> This vibration is transmitted along the incus and stapes to the oval window. Two small muscles, the tensor tympani and stapedius, also help modulate noise. The two muscles reflexively contract to dampen excessive vibrations. Vibration of the oval window causes vibration of the endolymph within the vestibule and the cochlea.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} {{derailments}} {{in the mid-1970s}} shattered Amtrak's confidence in the locomotive, and many railroads banned it from their tracks. Multiple investigations pointed to issues with the locomotive's trucks, {{the weight of the}} water and steam generators used for train heating, or <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> of baggage cars behind the locomotive. In 1977 Amtrak decided to move on from the SDP40F in favor of the EMD F40PH, which was already in use on short-distance routes. Amtrak traded most of its fleet into EMD; the components were incorporated into new F40PHs. The remainder were traded to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF) for use in freight service. The Santa Fe rebuilt the locomotives and designated them SDF40-2. The Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway (BNSF), successor to the Santa Fe, retired them in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Japanese temple bells are struck {{externally}} {{with either}} a hammer or a suspended beam rather than with an internal clapper. The sound of the bell {{is made up of}} three parts. First is the atari, the impact of the strike. A well-made bell should produce a clean, clear tone. The initial sound of the strike is immediately followed by the prolonged oshi, the reverberation that continues to sound after the bell is struck. This is higher in pitch and is a low rumble with a sorrowful air, rich in harmonics; it lasts for up to ten seconds. Finally comes the okuri or decay, the resonance that is heard as <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> of the bell dies away, which can last up to a minute. There are also continuous harmonic overtones heard throughout the tolling of the bell. These multiple tones create a complex pitch profile.|$|E

The method for defeating Mantis was also changed from using the second controller to simply using the keyboard (regardless of whether the player was using a game controller or not up to that point). Other omissions include {{the removal of}} the eighth Codec frequency (140.07), which featured written commentaries by the developers, Meryl's alternate sneaking suit outfit, and the mission logs when loading a save file. However, the PC version adds the option to toggle moving and shooting in first-person view mode at any time regardless of difficulty setting, and players can now save their progress at any point without contacting Mei-Ling through the use of quick saves.

5|$|Soon {{after the}} railway opened, {{complaints}} about vibrations from passing trains {{began to be}} made by occupiers of buildings along the route. The vibrations were caused by the heavy, largely unsprung locomotives which weighed 44tons (44.7tonnes). The Board of Trade set up a committee to investigate the problem, and the CLR experimented with two solutions. For the first solution, three locomotives were modified to use lighter motors and were provided with improved suspension, so the weight was reduced to 31tons (31.5tonnes), more of which was sprung to reduce vibrations; for the second solution, two six-carriage trains were formed that had the two end carriages converted and provided with driver's cabs and their own motors so they could run as multiple units without a separate locomotive. The lighter locomotives did reduce the vibrations felt at the surface, but the multiple units removed it almost completely and the CLR chose to adopt that solution. The committee's report, published in 1902, also found that the CLR's choice of 100lb/yard (49.60kg/m) bridge rail for its tracks rather than a stiffer bullhead rail on cross sleepers contributed to <b>the</b> <b>vibration.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} {{vibrations}} in bikes includes its causes, such as engine balance, wheel balance, ground surface, and aerodynamics; its transmission and absorption; {{and its effects}} on the bike, the rider, and safety. An important factor in any vibration analysis is a comparison of the natural frequencies of the system with the possible driving frequencies of <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> sources. A close match means mechanical resonance that can result in large amplitudes. A challenge in vibration damping is to create compliance in certain directions (vertically) without sacrificing frame rigidity needed for power transmission and handling (torsionally). Another issue with vibration for the bike is the possibility of failure due to material fatigue Effects of vibration on riders include discomfort, loss of efficiency, Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome, a secondary form Raynaud's disease, and whole body vibration. Vibrating instruments may be inaccurate or difficult to read.|$|E

25|$|Classical {{conditioning}} {{is described}} as the pairing of a conditioned stimulus (CS) (such as a vibration) with an unconditioned stimulus (US) (such as a loud noise) to evoke a conditioned response (CR) (agitation).

50|$|The USDC {{is driven}} by a Piezoelectric stack {{actuator}} that creates <b>the</b> <b>vibrations.</b> <b>The</b> actuator vibrates at an extremely high frequency, making it ultrasonic, and it is these waves of vibration that are transmitted by the horn of the actuator {{all the way to}} the bit itself. <b>The</b> <b>vibrations</b> are created at the actuator and are transferred by the horn to a free mass. The free mass vibrates between the drill stem and the horn of the actuator to transmit <b>the</b> <b>vibrations</b> down <b>the</b> drill stem.

25|$|Other properties, however, {{although}} usually {{described in}} terms of origin, may be generalized to all waves. For such reasons, wave theory represents a particular branch of physics that is concerned with the properties of wave processes independently of their physical origin. For example, based on the mechanical origin of acoustic waves, a moving disturbance in spaceâtime can exist if and only if the medium involved is neither infinitely stiff nor infinitely pliable. If all the parts making up a medium were rigidly bound, then they would all vibrate as one, with no delay in the transmission of <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> and therefore no wave motion. On the other hand, if all the parts were independent, then there would not be any transmission of <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> and again, no wave motion. Although the above statements are meaningless in the case of waves that do not require a medium, they reveal a characteristic that is relevant to all waves regardless of origin: within a wave, the phase of a vibration (that is, its position within <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> cycle) is different for adjacent points in space because <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> reaches these points at different times.|$|E
