6000|$|In a {{few minutes}} they were near {{enough to see the}} mast of the [...] "Nancy" [...] dimly in the dark.

60|$|It seemed {{probable}} {{that when the}} first of the Frenchmen gained the schooner's deck, after the fury of the tempest had forced them to retreat from the stockade, the wild tossing of the craft as the waves were beginning to rise induced them <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> every <b>anchor</b> on board, under the belief that she could be held at moorings until the storm had subsided sufficiently to admit of her clawing away from the shore.|$|R
6000|$|There were no charts {{covered with}} {{soundings}} {{to guide the}} mariner in those days, {{but it did not}} require much experience to convince a seaman that land was probably too near, with such a sudden change from twenty to fifteen fathoms. Arkal was, however, not unprepared for it, and quickly gave orders to stand by <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> the <b>anchors.</b> At that moment the voice of little Maikar was heard shouting, in stentorian tones, [...] "Land ahead!" ...|$|R
50|$|For {{distinguished}} {{conduct in}} the line of his profession, extraordinary courage, and disregard of his own safety during the attack on the Fleet in Pearl Harbor, by Japanese forces on December 7, 1941. During the height of the strafing and bombing, Chief Boatswain Hill led his men of the linehandling details of the U.S.S. Nevada to the quays, cast off the lines and swam back to his ship. Later, while on the forecastle, attempting <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> the <b>anchors,</b> he was blown overboard and killed by the explosion of several bombs.|$|R
6000|$|Then we {{struck a}} disappointment, {{for one of}} them early morning fogs started up, and it warn't no use to sail over the top of it, because we would go by Egypt, sure, so we judged it was best to set her by compass {{straight}} for the place where the pyramids was gitting blurred and blotted out, and then drop low and skin along pretty close to the ground and keep a sharp lookout. Tom took the hellum, I stood by <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> the <b>anchor,</b> and Jim he straddled the bow to dig through the fog with his eyes and watch out for danger ahead. We went along a steady gait, but not very fast, and the fog got solider and solider, so solid that Jim looked dim and ragged and smoky through it. It was awful still, and we talked low and was anxious. Now and then Jim would say: ...|$|R
60|$|After {{this the}} sea began to fall, only to grow rough {{again for a}} while as they crossed some bar, to find {{themselves}} in calm water, and {{on either side of}} them what appeared in the dim, uncertain light to be the bush-clad banks of a river. For a while they ran on, till Lozelle called in a loud voice to the sailors <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the <b>anchor</b> <b>go,</b> and sent a messenger to say that all might rest now, as they were safe. So they laid them down and tried to sleep.|$|R
60|$|Notwithstanding these {{sudden and}} {{alarming}} losses, the work went on. Hillson seemed suddenly to become {{conscious of the}} necessity of exertion, and by giving his utmost attention to hoisting out the launch, that boat was got safely into the water. By this time the ship had beaten so far over the reef, as scarcely to touch at all, and Mark had everything ready for <b>letting</b> <b>go</b> his <b>anchors,</b> the instant he had reason to believe she was in water deep enough to float her. The thumps grew lighter and lighter, and the lead-line showed a considerable drift; so much so, indeed, as to require its being hauled in and cast anew every minute. Under all the circumstances, Mark expected each instant, to find himself in four fathoms' water, and he intended <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> the <b>anchor</b> the moment he was assured of that fact. In the mean time, he ordered the carpenter to sound the pumps. This was done, and the ship was reported with only the customary quantity of water in the well. As yet her bottom was not injured, materially at least.|$|R
50|$|Damage to the Blackthorn {{from the}} initial impact was not extensive. However, Capricorns anchor was ready <b>to</b> be <b>let</b> <b>go.</b> The <b>anchor</b> became {{embedded}} in the Blackthorns hull and ripped open the port side above the water line. Then as the two ships backed away from each other, the chain became taut. The force of the much larger ship pulling on it, caused Blackthorn to tip on her side until she suddenly capsized. Six off-duty personnel who had mustered {{when they heard the}} collision alarm were trapped inside the ship. Several crew members who had just reported aboard tried to escape and in the process trapped themselves in the engine room. Although 27 crewmen survived the collision, 23 perished.|$|R
60|$|A heavy gulf {{thunderstorm}} was raging, when {{after a long}} {{passage and}} at the end of a sultry calm day, wasted in drifting helplessly in sight of his destination, Lingard, taking advantage of fitful gusts of wind, approached the shores of Wajo. With characteristic audacity, he held on his way, closing in with a coast to which he was a stranger, and on a night that would have appalled any other man; while at every dazzling flash, Hassim's native land seemed to leap nearer at the brig--and disappear instantly as though it had crouched low for the next spring out of an impenetrable darkness. During the long day of the calm, he had obtained from the deck and from aloft, such good views of the coast, and had noted the lay of the land and the position of the dangers so carefully that, though at the precise moment when he gave the order <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> the <b>anchor,</b> he had been for some time able to see no further than if his head had been wrapped in a woollen blanket, yet the next flickering bluish flash showed him the brig, anchored almost exactly where he had judged her to be, off a narrow white beach near the mouth of a river.|$|R
60|$|The {{remainder}} of the time I spent in making feverish preparations for arriving and seeing my dear comrades. I remembered {{that they were not}} in the habit of rising before six, and as it was now only three, I hoped to arrive before they were awake. Moreover, I set about making ready <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> the <b>anchor,</b> resolving in my own mind that as I knew the depth of water in the passage of the reef and within the lagoon, I would run the schooner in and bring up opposite the bower. Fortunately the anchor was hanging at the cat-head, otherwise I should never have been able to use it. Now I had only to cut the tackling, and it would drop of its own weight. After searching among the flags, I found the terrible black one, which I ran up to the peak. While I was doing this a thought struck me. I went to the powder-magazine, brought up a blank cartridge, and loaded the big brass gun, which, it will be remembered, was unhoused when we set sail; and as I had no means of housing it, there it had stood, bristling alike at fair weather and foul all the voyage. I took care to grease its mouth well, and before leaving the fore part of the ship, thrust the poker into the fire.|$|R
60|$|The boat now {{returned}} to the ship, which it met at the distance of {{half a mile from}} the inlet. The current setting southwardly, her progress had been more rapid than when heading north, and her drift had been less towards the land. Still there was so little wind, so steady a ground-swell, and it was possible to carry so little after-sail, that great doubts were entertained of being able to weather the rocks sufficiently to turn into the inlet. Twenty times in the next half hour was the order <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> the <b>anchor,</b> on the point of being given, as the wind baffled, and as often was it countermanded, to take advantage of its reviving. These were feverish moments, for the ship was now so near the reef as to render her situation very insecure in the event of the wind's rising, or of a sea's getting up, the sand of the bottom being too hard to make good holding-ground. Still, as there was a possibility, in the present state of the weather, of kedging the ship off a mile into the offing, if necessary, Captain Truck stood on with a boldness he might not otherwise have felt. The anchor hung suspended by a single turn of the stopper, ready to drop at a signal, and Mr. Truck stood between the knight-heads, watching the slow progress of the vessel, and accurately noticing every foot of leeward set she made, as compared with the rocks.|$|R
60|$|There was, now, but one opinion among us, {{and that}} was this:--we thought the ship had entered one of the {{passages}} that intersect Terra del Fuego, {{and that there was}} the chance of soon finding a lee, as these channels were known to be very irregular and winding. To run in the night seemed impossible; nor was it desirable, as it was almost certain we should be compelled to return by the way we had entered, to extricate ourselves from the dangers of so intricate a navigation. Islands began to appear, moreover, and we had indications that the main passage itself, was beginning to diminish in width. Under the circumstances, therefore, it was resolved to get everything ready, and <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> two <b>anchors,</b> as soon as we could find a suitable spot. Between the hours of two and four, the ship passed seventeen islets, some of them quite near; but they afforded no shelter. At last, and it was time, the sun beginning to fall very low, as we could see by the waning light, we saw an island of some height and size ahead, and we hoped it might afford us a lee. The tide had changed too, {{and that was}} in our favour. Turning to windward, however, was out of the question, since we could carry no sail, and the night was near. Anchor, then, we must, or continue to drive onward in the darkness, sheered about in all directions by a powerful adverse current. It is true, this current would have been a means of safety, by enabling us to haul up from rocks and dangers ahead, could we carry any canvass; but it still blew too violently for the last. To anchor, then, it was determined.|$|R
