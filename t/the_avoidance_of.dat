40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Avoidance</b> <b>of</b> {{activity}} is hypothesized {{to lead to}} muscle weakness and consequently, to physical disability. This study was undertaken to validate <b>the</b> <b>avoidance</b> model by providing evidence for the mediating role of muscle weakness in <b>the</b> relationship between <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity and physical disability in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. METHODS: Data on <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity, observed physical disability, and muscle strength of the knee in 107 patients with knee OA were analyzed. A series of regression analyses was performed to establish the mediating role of muscle weakness. First, <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity on <b>the</b> level of disability was assessed. Next, <b>the</b> relationship between <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity and muscle strength was established. Finally, the mediating role of muscle strength could be established if <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity on disability decreased when muscle strength was taken into account. RESULTS: Initially, <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity accounted for 21. 5 % of variance in disability. <b>Avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity also accounted for 3. 9 % of variance in muscle strength. After muscle strength was taken into account, the variance in disability accounted for by <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity was reduced from 21. 5 % to 15. 7 %. Thus, the criteria for establishing the mediating role of muscle strength were met. CONCLUSION: The {{results of this study}} provide evidence for the mediating role of muscle weakness in <b>the</b> relationship between <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity and disability in patients with knee OA.

5|$|In recent decades, {{substantial}} numbers of central European birds have taken to wintering in gardens in Great Britain, and, to a lesser extent, Ireland, where the blackcap was formerly just a summer visitor. Although the British climate is sub-optimal, compensatory factors include the ready availability of food, (particularly from bird tables), a shorter migration distance, and <b>the</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> the Alps and the Sahara Desert. These wintering birds come from Germany, and isotope analysis (which enables the wintering location to be determined) showed that the German birds wintering in Britain tend to mate only among themselves, and do not usually interbreed with those wintering in the Mediterranean or western Africa. This is because the British migrants arrive back on the breeding grounds earlier than blackcaps wintering around the Mediterranean, and form pairs before the southern birds arrive. Mixed pairings are also selected against because the hybrid young would migrate in an intermediate direction, which would take them into the Bay of Biscay.|$|E

Still, US Secretary of State Upshur vigorously courted Texas diplomats to begin annexation talks, finally dispatching an appeal to President Sam Houston in January 1844.

5|$|To {{transport}} the raiders to the island, two tugs, Vulcan and Nuneaton, {{were provided by}} the Governor of Nigeria, Sir Bernard Bourdillon. The raiding force would consist of 32 men, four SOE agents, 11 commandos from the SSRF and 17 men recruited from the local population to crew the two tugs. The mission suffered a blow when the British General Officer Commanding (GOC) West Africa Command, General Sir George Giffard refused to support the mission and would not release the 17 men required, stating it would compromise some unnamed plans {{he had in mind}} and the act of piracy would have repercussions. Responding to the concerns of the GOC West Africa, the Admiralty suspended the operation. The Foreign Office was also not in favour of the operation, and neither was the British Embassy in Madrid, which was concerned about the possible reactions of the Spanish government. The final go ahead, eventually supported by the Foreign Office, was not given until 6 January 1942, on the grounds that suspicion of British involvement in the raid was inevitable; what counted was <b>the</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> any tangible proof. As a safeguard the Admiralty also dispatched , a , to intercept the vessels at sea, which would provide the cover story that they had been intercepted while trying to make their way home to Europe.|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} the mediating role of reduced muscle strength in <b>the</b> relationship between <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity and limitations in activities {{in patients with}} knee or hip osteoarthritis (OA). MethodsA longitudinal cohort study with 5 years follow-up was conducted. Patients with knee or hip OA (n =  288) were recruited at rehabilitation centers and hospitals. Self-reported and performance based limitations in activities, <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity and muscle strength were assessed at baseline, 1, 2, 3 and 5 years follow-up. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) analyses were used to evaluate mediation. ResultsIn patients with knee OA, reduced knee extensor muscle strength mediated <b>the</b> relationship between <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity and limitations in activities. In patients with hip OA reduced hip abductor muscle strength mediates <b>the</b> relationship between <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity and limitations in activities. ConclusionThe results of this longitudinal study support <b>the</b> theory that <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity leads to deterioration of muscle strength and consequently to more limitations in activities in patients with knee and hip OA...|$|R
