A panel of variables among which trophic and microbial (enzyme activities, abundance of hetetrophic bacteria and of bacterial pollution indicators) parameters, were selected. Particulate organic carbon (POC) and nitrogen (PON) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) contents defined the trophic state, while microbial hydrolysis rates and abundance gave insights on microbial community efficiency in organic matter transformation and on allochthonous inputs. To classify the trophic state of examined waters, the synthetic trophic state index (TRIX) was calculated. Microbial hydrolysis rates correlated positively with POC and Chl-a, which increased along the eutrophication gradient. The significant relationships among TRIX, trophic and microbial parameters suggested the use of leucine aminopeptidase, alkaline phosphatase and POC as suitable parameters to implement the Water Framework Directive when assessing the ecological status of <b>transitional</b> <b>water</b> systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires evaluation of the ecological status (ES) of benthic communities in coastal and <b>transitional</b> <b>water</b> systems, and the intercalibration of assessment methodologies therefore becomes a research challenge. Our aim was to test the suitability of applying the M-AMBI index to assess {{the status of the}} Eo estuary (northern coast of Spain). Our results showed that M-AMBI was influenced by the natural variability of benthic communities, and presented an apparent dependence on habitat characteristics. Consequently, the definition of homogeneous areas in <b>transitional</b> <b>water</b> systems should be based on the salinity gradient combined with other factors. To achieve an accurate ES assessment, habitat-specific reference conditions should then be defined prior to the application of M-AMBI; this necessitates dividing an estuary into several sections, which may be classified as different ESs. From this perspective, a novel approach to integrate habitat heterogeneity in a global ES assessment was tested. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Estuaries, rias, fjords and lagoons (collectively called <b>transitional</b> <b>waters,</b> TW) {{are highly}} {{important}} ecosystems both for their high productivity {{but also as}} sites of urban and industrial development, supporting many major cities and ports.

We have thus revisited the fundamental properties and paradigms of these systems in the light of recent ecological theory. The analysis has produced a unifying approach to <b>transitional</b> <b>waters,</b> by adopting and expanding the concept of ecotone to whole ecosystems, rather than ecosystem boundaries.

40|$|Knowledge on the {{structure}} and functioning variability of <b>transitional</b> <b>water</b> fish assemblages may help in finding out the main descriptors for identifying different water body types for which specific biological reference conditions can be reliably derived. Fish assemblages from 19 Mediterranean lagoons were therefore investigated by evaluating the variability of their structure and functioning, and by relating it to the lagoons’ environmental features. Fish assemblage structure was measured by its species richness. Functioning was measured by categorizing fish species into functional categories (or guilds) according to their use of lagoon habitat, feeding and reproduction, and by defining the functional structure of fish assemblages as the relative number of species per guild in each lagoon. Mediterranean lagoons’ fish assemblages {{were found to be}} more similar to each other in their functional structure than in the taxonomical composition, thus confirming a shared functional role of these environments for biological communities. Lagoon local features, such as the lagoon area, its habitat heterogeneity and average salinity, significantly affected the total species richness and the different use that fish make of the lagoon environment, hence playing a primary role in the assessment of these water body types. Latitude also influenced the variability of fish assemblages in the Mediterranean lagoons investigated, with particular regard to their functioning as feeding and reproductive grounds for fish. These results are compared with previous studies and, although this limited the investigation to structural aspects only, were found to confirm in part the previous results and also added new insights about the key factors affecting the functioning of <b>transitional</b> <b>water</b> systems...|$|R

40|$|Fish fauna is an {{important}} component of <b>transitional</b> <b>waters</b> biodiversity. Different ways of using these systems and their resources can be identified, and fish fauna of <b>transitional</b> <b>waters</b> can be categorized accordingly into several functional groups (or guilds). These functional groups are presented and described in this paper, with regard to fish adaptations to Northern Adriatic transitional water environments, and the Venice lagoon in particular. The temporal and spatial dynamics of fish fauna in such a variable and heterogeneous system is also reviewed, by taking into consideration both the taxonomical and functional (guilds) characteristics of the lagoon assemblage. The use of guilds, in fact, highlights the functional structure of complex ecosystems, such as estuaries and coastal lagoons, by accounting for availability of ecological niches within the overall physical– chemical functioning of transitional water systems...|$|E

The high incidence of protective breeders in estuaries, as a mechanism to prevent the flushing out of young, has also been identified.

40|$|On October 23 th 2000, the EU Water Framework Directive {{was finally}} adopted. The Directive was {{published}} in the Official Journal on December 22 th 2000 and entered into force the same day. The Water Framework Directive expands the scope of water protection of all waters and sets clear objectives that a 'good status' must be achieved for all European waters by 2015 and that water use must be sustainable throughout Europe. According to the Directive, the individual member states are obligated to describe ecological objectives orgoals for different waters. The aim of this project was to define ecological objectives for different biological quality elements for the Flemish <b>transitional</b> <b>waters.</b> In this document quality indices for benthos and phytoplankton have been presented. This document includes a study about the different approaches and methods used in Europe to define these ecological objectives. None of the existing indices was satisfactory and applicable on the Flemish <b>transitional</b> <b>waters,</b> neither forbenthos nor for phytoplankton. This {{has to do with the}} complexity of transitional water systems. For the Flemish <b>transitional</b> <b>waters</b> no temporal or spatial reference is available. The reference is therefore based on the available knowledge about the ecological functioning of estuaries. Concerning phytoplankton, separate indices have been established for the salt and fresh water zones of an estuary. For brackish water, a natural mortality zone for plankton, indices would be pointless. The scoring system for phytoplankton takes into account the trophic status (including the important element silica), the photic status and the danger of flushing. This scoring system has a simple design and determination of the coefficients requires minimal effort. After evaluation by specialists and comparison with other scoring systems, we can state that the proposed phytoplankton index is promising. Nevertheless the index needs testing, because the available data of the Flemish <b>transitional</b> <b>waters</b> were used for its compilation. For benthos indices have been established for fresh water and for salt and brackish water together. These indices are derived from the marine index of Borja et al. (2000), which takes into account the response of species to organic load. For salt and brackish water the 'Borja'- index was combined with an index based on sensitivity/tolerance for current velocity. The 'Borja'-index and the proposed index were tested on the sediments of the Scheldt estuary. Although the proposed indices showed improvement in comparison with application of 'Borja', they, still are not fully satisfying. The lack of any score for absolute density - or biomass values proved to be a shortcoming. The sensitivity/tolerance of species to organic pollution needs to be further examined, especially for estuarine fresh water species. For macro-algae and angiosperms no indices have been established. At present the role of macro algae in the Flemish <b>transitional</b> <b>waters</b> is nihil, and most probably this will not change in the future, so indices would be pointless. The only angiosperms occurring in the Flemish <b>transitional</b> <b>waters</b> are tidal flat vegetation, the discussion whether tidal flat vegetation must be incorporated in the quality index still exists...|$|E

40|$|Water wave {{breaking}} is {{a dominant}} dynamical {{process of the}} upper ocean, inducing strong flow-turbulence-wave interactions and air-sea exchanges. A fundamental and long-standing gap {{in the understanding of}} wave breaking is how to characterise and predict the onset of breaking. The threshold for the onset of breaking proposed by Barthelemy et al. (arXiv: 1508. 06002 v 1, 2015) has been investigated intensively in the laboratory for different classes of two- and three-dimensional wave groups in deep and <b>transitional</b> <b>water</b> in the absence and presence of wind. Thermal Image Velocimetry was used to compare measurements of the wave crest surface water particle velocity with the wave crest speed determined by an array of closely-spaced wave gauges. For the first time, a threshold crest point surface energy flux ratio (Bx) that distinguishes maximum group recurrence from marginal group breaking has been established for gravity waves. The critical value of Bx was found to be 0. 835 ± 0. 005 with an experimental uncertainty of each data point of ± 0. 020. The breaking threshold is robust for different types of unidirectional and directional wave groups. Very weak dependence on wind forcing and group bandwidth is demonstrated. No dependence on relative water depth was observed. If there is a dependence on peak spectral wavenumber, it is weak and negligible for the scales achievable in a large-scale laboratory. This study provides more robust and universal characterisation of breaking in <b>transitional</b> <b>water</b> than the empirical non-dimensionalisation of Nelson (1994). The effect of wave grouping can generate marginally breaking waves in shallower water that are at least 30 % greater than the limit proposed by Nelson. The study supports use of a limit at least that recommended by McCowan (1894) /Miche (1944) for coastal engineering design in <b>transitional</b> and shallow <b>water</b> until it is demonstrated that there is negligible risk of strongly breaking group waves achieving higher breaker indices...|$|R

40|$|According to the Water Framework Directive (WFD), {{the status}} of European surface waters is {{assessed}} using aquatic organism groups. Here we present an overview of 297 assessment methods, based on a questionnaire survey addressing authorities in all countries implementing the WFD. Twenty-eight countries reported on methods applied to rivers (30 %), coastal waters (26 %), lakes (25 %) and <b>transitional</b> <b>waters</b> (19 %). More {{than half of the}} methods are based on macroscopic plants (28 %) or benthic invertebrates (26 %); in addition, phytoplankton (21 %), fish (15 %) and phytobenthos (10 %) were assessed. Countries of Central and Western Europe had developed almost all methods required for the WFD implementation. Two main sampling strategies were discernable: Small-scale sampling of the taxonomically diverse groups of benthic invertebrates and phytobenthos that demand elaborate processing, versus large-scale sampling of vast, species-poor plant stands or the mobile fish fauna. About three-quarters of methods identified organisms to species-level while in particular phytoplankton-based methods used class- or phylum-level, or included no taxonomic information. Out of nine metric types distinguished, river methods used more sensitivity and trait metrics while for other water categories abundance metrics prevailed. Fish-based methods showed the highest number of metrics. Fifty-six percent of methods focussed on the detection of eutrophication and organic pollution, with shares decreasing from autotrophic to heterotrophic organism groups: phytoplankton > phytobenthos > macroscopic plants > benthic invertebrates > fish fauna. The order was almost reverse for hydrological or morphological deterioration: fish fauna and macroscopic plants > benthic invertebrates > phytoplankton > phytobenthos. These pressures were mainly assessed by methods applied to rivers and <b>transitional</b> <b>waters.</b> The pressure-impact relationship of about one-third of methods was not tested empirically with methods for <b>transitional</b> <b>waters</b> being the least validated. The strength of relationships differed significantly between organism groups and water categories. The correlation coefficients generally covered a broad range (0. 8), but on average with the pattern: phytoplankton > macroscopic plants > benthic invertebrates > phytobenthos and fish fauna. In terms of water categories the following order resulted: coastal waters > lakes > <b>transitional</b> <b>waters</b> > rivers. Status boundaries were mostly defined using statistical approaches.

Specifically, we focused on the estab-lishment of water-bodies typologies and the assessment of water quality in <b>transitional</b> <b>waters.</b> We measured water-chemistry (salinity and nutrients) in 34 coastal lagoons on a monthly basis over a full year (March’ 08 –February’ 09) in a Mediterranean archipelago (Balearic Islands, Spain).

From an applied perspec-tive, our results show that monthly values were inadequate for determining salinity-based typologies, as lagoon salinity val-ues varied widely from month-to-month. Additionally, we found a lack of agreement between ecological assessments based on invertebrates and those based on nutrient thresholds often used for <b>transitional</b> <b>waters.</b> These facts highlight the need for a definition of specific thresholds for coastal lagoons which are not currently available...|$|E
