She rarely talks, and she sometimes hurts others' feelings even <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not mean it.|$|E
5|$|Joan {{returns to}} Rheims {{to witness the}} {{coronation}} of Charles VII of France.

She {{gradually}} opens up her feelings of ignorance and being out of her depth at court; they also discuss court politics and academic subjects, with her admirer offering advice and encouragement about her growing knowledge. Meanwhile, Mel meets Merindar's reclusive son Flauvic and pursues a brief relationship with him before realizing that she has no real feelings for him.

5|$|Nani is a {{young man}} who specialises in {{preparing}} fireworks. He is in love with his neighbour Bindu, a micro artist who runs Project 511, a non-governmental organisation (NGO). Bindu also develops feelings for Nani <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not express them. Seeking to raise money for her NGO, Bindu visits the office of a rich, powerful industrialist named Sudeep, who also finds her attractive. He befriends her, donates 1.5 million (US$ thousand), and gains her trust. Sudeep sees Nani as a rival and plans to kill him. One night, Nani helps Bindu to finish a piece of micro art—a locket made from a pencil. While returning home, he is kidnapped by Sudeep, who kills him, making his death look like an accident. Unaware of the incident, Bindu proposes to the dying Nani by telephone; it is the last thing Nani hears before he is reincarnated as a housefly that cannot remember its previous life.|$|E
5|$|Yui {{is a big}} fan and {{initially}} an assistant to Girls Dead Monster. She {{is known to be}} hyperactive and talks extremely fast. Hinata finds Yui annoying, which results in bouts {{between the two of them}} though in truth, they truly care about one another, saying that had they met before they died, they would have fallen in love with one another. She wears a devil tail and shackle bracelets on her wrists, giving her an image of an imp or devil. She also has wings hidden by her hair on her back. After Iwasawa's departure, Yui becomes the new rhythm guitarist and vocalist of Girls Dead Monster, as well as its leader. Yui plays a Gibson SG Special electric guitar. She later becomes a part of the main SSS, following them along on missions, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not contribute much. In life, she was hit by a car and was paralyzed from a young age as a result. Her regret was not being able to do anything with her body. Otonashi helps fulfill most of her wishes that include many things she saw on TV when she was alive, although it is Hinata who fulfills her last desire to be married by proposing to her.|$|E
5|$|Anthony first appears when he poses as {{a member}} of the Walford council to help Eddie eject a {{squatter}} from a premises that they want to move their antiques business into. He then decides to remain in Walford and helps his father set up the business. Anthony buys some candlesticks from Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not know their true value, but when Cora finds out their true value, she accuses Anthony of scamming her. Eddie sells the candlesticks for £8000, and when Tyler decides to take part in an unlicensed boxing match, Michael convinces Anthony that Tyler will win and that it would be a good idea to place a bet on him, knowing that Anthony suffers with a gambling addiction. Anthony steals £8000 from Eddie's safe, but bets on Tyler's opponent Artie Stiller (Maurice Lee), which leaves Michael unimpressed, as he has researched Artie and found out he is tough. During the fight, however, Tyler narrowly wins so Anthony has to confess to Eddie that he has lost the money. Shortly after he does, Tyler collapses and has a seizure, so is rushed to hospital. Eddie is sickened by Anthony's actions and tells him he wishes he was dying in a hospital bed, rather than Tyler. Distraught, Anthony storms out and attends a party run by Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton), culminating in him kissing her. Afterwards, Anthony returns to the hospital to learn that Tyler has been taken for a life-saving operation and is furious that Eddie was not around. Eddie then admits that his children would be better off without him. Tyler survives and recovers, but the brothers are told by Eddie that Michael set up an unfair fight to punish the family, leading Tyler and Anthony to reject Michael. Eddie then leaves Walford, leaving Tyler and Anthony the antiques business.|$|E

25|$|Though Mr. Morgan is a {{university}} professor, Peter grumbles constantly about {{school and the}} irrelevant facts he feels forced to learn, including Welsh. Jenny is allowed to stay in Wales and miss a year of school <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> do some reading and keeps a journal. Thus, according to Ann Hildebrand in The Dreary Time: The Ethos of School in Award-Winning Fiction for Children, Bond's book reinforces the idea that school is an unpleasant necessity that keeps a child from more enjoyable and meaningful activities.|$|E
25|$|When the lizards {{approach}} them, Nancy is fascinated but {{a little}} afraid. She remains close to Charlie. <b>Though</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not agree with him, she does find him a small stick {{to use as a}} defense. It is Nancy who comes {{up with the idea of}} lying down in a submissive posture when Leslie and Sarah come near. Charlie follows Nancy's directions in most of the dealings with the lizards. After it becomes clear that the lizards will not harm them, Nancy is excited by their presence. She does everything she can to learn about them and make a connection with them. She wants to shake hands with them first.|$|E
25|$|The other {{significant}} {{form of communication}} is between the two couples and is different between the genders. Nancy is very curious about and open with the lizards. <b>Though</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> become slightly frustrated by their limitations, she tries to help them by explaining aspects of human life they do not understand. Her general kindness toward them and offer of help when the lizards are deciding whether to stay on land or {{to go back to}} the sea influences their decision. Charlie is less forthcoming and more suspicious. He has a hard time accepting the lizards and quickly becomes testy when they do not understand his explanations.|$|E

25|$|In {{the poem}} Lokasenna, where Loki accuses nearly every female in {{attendance}} of promiscuity or unfaithfulness, an aggressive exchange occurs between Loki and Freyja. The {{introduction to the}} poem notes that among other gods and goddesses, Freyja attends a celebration held by Ægir. In verse, after Loki has flyted with the goddess Frigg, Freyja interjects, telling Loki that he is insane for dredging up his terrible deeds, and that Frigg knows the fate of everyone, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not tell it. Loki tells her to be silent, and says that he knows all about herthat Freyja is not lacking in blame, {{for each of the}} gods and elves in the hall have been her lover. Freyja objects. She says that Loki is lying, that he is just looking to blather about misdeeds, and since the gods and goddesses are furious at him, he can expect to go home defeated. Loki tells Freyja to be silent, calls her a malicious witch, and conjures a scenario where Freyja was once astride her brother when all of the gods, laughing, surprised the two. Njörðr interjectshe says that a woman having a lover other than her husband is harmless, and he points out that Loki has borne children, and calls Loki a pervert. The poem continues in turn.|$|E

500|$|The Scranton {{branch is}} {{relieved}} {{when they hear}} they are saved, and Kelly is thrilled that she and Ryan don't have to break up after all. When Michael and Dwight get the news, they celebrate their success, believing, erroneously, that they accomplished it. After agonizing over the decision, Jim accepts the position and suggests to Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones) that she join him in Scranton. In a talking head interview, Karen admits that even <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not think he is [...] "into her," [...] she is [...] "kind of into him".|$|E
500|$|Wollstonecraft {{and others}} criticized the {{traditional}} [...] "accomplishment"-based education traditionally offered women; {{they argued that}} this kind of education, which emphasized the acquisition of skills such as drawing and dancing, was useless and decadent. The ideal woman in Thoughts is, as Wollstonecraft scholar Gary Kelly writes, [...] "rational, provident, realistic, self-disciplined, self-conscious and critical", an image that resembles that of the professional man. Wollstonecraft argues that women should have all of the intellectual and moral training given to men, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not provide women with a place to use these new skills beyond the home.|$|E
500|$|The script {{comments}} cheekily on the Beatles' fame. For instance, at {{one point}} a fan, played by Anna Quayle, apparently recognises John Lennon, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not actually mention Lennon's name, saying only [...] "you are...". He demurs, saying his face is not quite right for [...] "him", initiating a surreal dialogue ending with the fan agreeing that Lennon doesn't [...] "look like him at all", and Lennon saying to himself that [...] "she looks more like him than I do". Other dialogue is derived from actual interviews with the Beatles. When Ringo is asked if he's a mod or a rocker, he replies: [...] "Uh, no, I'm a mocker", a line derived from a joke he made on the TV show Ready Steady Go!. The frequent reference to McCartney's grandfather (Wilfrid Brambell) as a [...] "clean old man" [...] sets up a contrast with the stock description of Brambell's character, Albert Steptoe in Steptoe and Son, as a [...] "dirty old man".|$|E

500|$|Kapoor {{followed}} her success in Bodyguard and Ra.One with {{a role in}} Shakun Batra's directorial debut Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu (2012) opposite Imran Khan. Set in Las Vegas, the romantic comedy follows {{the story of two}} strangers who get married one night after getting drunk. She played Riana Braganza, a carefree young woman, and was particularly drawn to the qualities of her character: [...] "Riana knows what she is doing. Even <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not have a house or a job, she is a positive person [...] very similar to the way I am." [...] The film received positive reviews and was an economic success, grossing a total of [...] in India and abroad. The Hollywood Reporter found her [...] "endearingly natural"; Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com asserted that [...] "after doing ornamental roles in films like Bodyguard and Ra.One, it is nice to see the spunky actress in her element again since Jab We Met." [...] She next appeared in Agent Vinod, an espionage thriller directed by Sriram Raghavan. Kapoor was enthusiastic about the project, but it met with a tepid response and she was described as miscast. When asked why she had taken the role, Kapoor described it as an opportunity to attempt something she had never done before.|$|E
500|$|Eve was {{contracted}} {{to appear in}} two episodes of Glee, having been offered the role of Grace after Whitney Houston declined to appear. Discussing her casting, Eve stated: [...] "I got asked and I'd heard the buzz about the show. When the first pilot episode came out, I figured it was something different and something we haven't seen on TV before. I didn't want to turn it down!" [...] She commented {{that she would have}} loved to have seen Whitney Houston appear in the show, explaining: [...] "I think it would've been different in a sense because she's an original diva. She would've brought a whole other energy, which would've been amazing." [...] Comparing her character Grace to McKinley High glee director Will, Eve explained: [...] "For me especially, I come from a harder place. I'm the teacher of a reform school. I'm used to being very strict." [...] Asked if she would return to the show in the future, she replied: [...] "If I'm asked to do it, I definitely would. It's just a really well-made, smart show." [...] <b>Though</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not sing in [...] "Hairography", Eve commented that she would like to do so if she returned to Glee in the future, naming [...] "Sweet Dreams" [...] by Eurythmics as her ideal song choice.|$|E

In [...] "Bulletproof", it is revealed that Tess knows where Lex is. Here, Lana informs Tess that Lex surgically implanted a nano-transmitter into Tess's optic nerve {{so that he could}} keep an eye on everything she is doing. Visibly upset by this, Tess places a jamming device into her necklace to disrupt the signal, but not before telling Lex that she will cut him off from the outside world and sell off everything that he owns. In the episode [...] "Requiem", it is revealed that Tess sold controlling interest in LuthorCorp to Queen Industries. In [...] "Turbulence", Tess tries to get Clark to reveal his powers after she read one of Lionel Luthor's journals that identified Clark as [...] "The Traveler", but her effort failed. In the episode [...] "Eternal", it is shown that Tess has the Kryptonian orb that brought down the Fortress of Solitude, and in [...] "Injustice" [...] a disembodied voice emanates from the orb revealing that Tess's recent actions to get Clark to reveal his powers and kill Doomsday are because the voice was instructing her to do so. In the season eight finale, the orb activates itself and transports Zod to Smallville.|$|E
