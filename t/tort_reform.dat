Give Me a Break: How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became the Scourge of the Liberal Media is a 2005 {{autobiography}} from Harper Perennial documenting {{his career and}} philosophical transition from liberalism to libertarianism.

It was a New York Times bestseller for 11 weeks. Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity: Get Out the Shovel– Why Everything You Know Is Wrong, {{which was published in}} 2007 by Hyperion, questions the validity of various conventional wisdoms, and argues that the belief he is conservative is untrue.

It argues that government policies meant to solve problems instead produce new ones, and that free individuals and the private sector perform tasks more efficiently than the government does.|$|E

40|$|Policy-makers {{and public}} health {{researchers}} are concerned that rapidly rising medical malpractice insurance premiums and reduced supply of malpractice insurance coverage have discouraged health-care providers from providing some key but high-risk services in certain geographic regions. Obstetricians/gynecologists and family practitioners who also provide obstetric services appear to be particularly vulnerable to pressure from malpractice litigations. They are frequently sued and face large damages when they lose. To mitigate perceived adverse effects of malpractice litigation on physician behaviors, states have introduced a variety of <b>tort</b> <b>reforms</b> such as caps on malpractice damage awards since the mid- 1970 s. This thesis examines the effect of direct <b>tort</b> <b>reforms</b> - those reforms {{that are expected to}} have a direct and significant impact on the size of malpractice damages [...] on access to hospital-based obstetric services. Using data from the American Hospital Association's annual survey of hospitals, we document a significant decline in the availability of hospital-based obstetric services in a county, particularly in rural communities, from the mid- 1980 s to the early 2000 s. By combining hospital data with novel data on the introduction and repeal of <b>tort</b> <b>reforms</b> at the state level, we are able to measure the effects of different types of reforms on the likelihood that a county has hospital-based obstetric services available. Applying a difference-in-difference approach to data from 1985, 1990, 1995, and 2000, we find some evidence that caps on total damages and the mandatory offset of compensation from collateral sources in total damages improve the availability of hospital-based obstetric services at the county level. Caps on non-economic damages have smaller effects while caps on punitive damages or allowing periodic payment of damages do not appear {{to have an impact on}} the likelihood that a county has hospital-based obstetric services available. The mandatory offset of collateral source rule is found to have a larger impact in rural counties. However, our estimates were not statistically significant at conventional levels and thus no firm conclusions concerning the impact of direct <b>tort</b> <b>reforms</b> on the provision of hospital-based obstetric services can be drawn...|$|R
40|$|Whereas the {{literature}} evaluating {{the effect of}} <b>tort</b> <b>reforms</b> {{has focused on the}} impact of reforms on insurers' reported incurred losses, this article examines the ultimate effects of reforms using the developed losses from a comprehensive sample of insurers writing medical malpractice insurance from 1984 to 2003. Noneconomic damages caps are particularly influential in reducing medical malpractice losses and increasing insurer profitability. The long-run effects of these reforms are greater than insurers' expected effects; for example, 5 - and 7 -year developed loss ratios are below the initially reported incurred loss ratios for those years following the enactment of noneconomic damages caps. Analyses of reported losses consequently understate the ultimate effects of <b>tort</b> <b>reforms.</b> The quantile regressions show that reforms have the greatest effects for the firms that are at {{the high end of the}} loss distribution.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe present {{liability}} {{system is}} not serving well childbearing women and newborns, maternity care clinicians, or those who pay for maternity care. Examination of evidence {{about the impact of}} this system on maternity care led us to identify seven aims for a high-functioning liability system in this clinical context. Herein, we identify policy strategies that are unlikely to meet the proposed criteria and contribute to needed improvements. A companion paper considers more promising strategies. MethodsWe considered whether 25 strategies that have been used or proposed for improvement have met or could meet the seven aims. We used a best available evidence approach and drew on more recent empirical legal studies and health services research about maternity care and liability, when available, and considered other studies when unavailable. FindingsFifteen strategies seem to have little potential to improve liability matters in maternity care. Despite support for capping non-economic damages, a series of studies has found a modest impact at best on maternity care. Maternity-specific studies also do not lend support to <b>tort</b> <b>reforms</b> collectively and several other specific <b>tort</b> <b>reforms.</b> Some <b>tort</b> alternative and liability insurance reform strategies have narrow aims and are not policy priorities. ConclusionsCaps on non-economic damages and other <b>tort</b> <b>reforms</b> have narrow aims and have been marginally effective at best in the context of maternity care. Several other possible reforms similarly are not promising. Continued focus on these strategies is unlikely to result in the high-performing liability system that maternity care stakeholders need...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} impact of six {{different}} types of <b>tort</b> <b>reforms</b> on the frequency, size, and number of total annual settlements in medical malpractice cases between 1991 and 1998. Medical malpractice data come from the National Practitioner Data Bank, which contains more than 100, 000 malpractice settlement payments in the study time frame. Of the six <b>tort</b> <b>reforms</b> examined, two reforms (caps on pain and suffering damages and limitations on joint and several liability) {{reduced the number of}} annual payments, and two reforms (caps on pain and suffering damages and the periodic-payment reform) reduced average awards. Caps on noneconomic damages had an effect on total annual payments, although the statistical significance of that effect was weak. The joint effect of enacting all six reforms was statistically significant for reducing the number of cases but not the state-level average award or total payments.
