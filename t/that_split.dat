Edwards won 49.5percent of the vote to Sloo's 46percent, with the rest going to Hubbard.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} by Koepfli and Wayne in 1998 found the giant otter {{has the highest}} divergence sequences within the otter subfamily, forming a distinct clade <b>that</b> <b>split</b> away 10 to 14 million years ago. They noted that the species may be the basal divergence among the otters or fall outside of them altogether, having split even before other mustelids, such as the ermine, polecat, and mink. Later gene sequencing research on the mustelids, from 2005, places the divergence of the giant otter somewhat later, between five and 11 million years ago; the corresponding phylogenetic tree locates the Lontra divergence first among otter genera, and Pteronura second, although divergence ranges overlap.|$|E

5|$|Viruses are green, (red in Rush mode in the iOS mobile version) spiky circles <b>that</b> <b>split</b> cells {{larger than}} them into many pieces (16 or fewer, {{depending}} on the mass) and smaller cells can hide underneath a virus for protection against larger cells. Cells in 16 pieces can eat viruses without splitting, though it is usually dangerous moving in many pieces, as the cells are smaller and easier to eat.. Viruses are normally randomly generated, but players can make new viruses by feeding a virus, i.e. ejecting {{a small fraction of}} a player's cell's mass into the virus a few times, causing the virus to split and hence create another virus.|$|E
5|$|A {{culture of}} {{violence}} {{rooted in the}} deep conflicts <b>that</b> <b>split</b> the countryside during the revolution would repeatedly erupt throughout the whole {{second half of the}} 20th century. The term 'social revolution' has been applied to a range of mostly violent activities of the left that included both altruistic attempts to organise real revolution and simple expressions of revenge, resentment and assertions of power. Violence was one of the many lessons learned during the Japanese occupation, and figures identified as 'feudal', including kings, regents, or simply the wealthy, were often attacked and sometimes beheaded. Rape became a weapon against 'feudal' women. In the coastal sultanates of Sumatra and Kalimantan, for example, sultans and others whose authority had been shored-up by the Dutch, were attacked as soon as Japanese authority left. The secular local lords of Aceh, who had been the foundation of Dutch rule, were executed, although most of Indonesia's sultanates fell back into Dutch hands.|$|E
5|$|Argon-argon radiometric dating {{indicates}} that the Kaiparowits Formation was deposited between 76.1 and 74.0million years ago, during the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period. During the Late Cretaceous period, {{the site of the}} Kaiparowits Formation was located near the western shore of the Western Interior Seaway, a large inland sea <b>that</b> <b>split</b> North America into two landmasses, Laramidia to the west and Appalachia to the east. The plateau where dinosaurs lived was an ancient floodplain dominated by large channels and abundant wetland peat swamps, ponds and lakes, and was bordered by highlands. The climate was wet and humid, and supported an abundant and diverse range of organisms. This formation contains one of the best and most continuous records of Late Cretaceous terrestrial life in the world.|$|E

5|$|Biogeography has a {{long history}} in the natural {{sciences}} concerning the spatial distribution of plants and animals. Ecology and evolution provide the explanatory context for biogeographical studies. Biogeographical patterns result from ecological processes that influence range distributions, such as migration and dispersal. and from historical processes <b>that</b> <b>split</b> populations or species into different areas. The biogeographic processes that result in the natural splitting of species explains much of the modern distribution of the Earth's biota. The splitting of lineages in a species is called vicariance biogeography and it is a sub-discipline of biogeography. There are also practical applications in the field of biogeography concerning ecological systems and processes. For example, the range and distribution of biodiversity and invasive species responding to climate change is a serious concern and active area of research in the context of global warming.|$|E
5|$|By 1388, {{the devastation}} of Dalmatia by the Bosnian army had become so severe that the {{authorities}} of the cities pleaded with Sigismund to either help them or {{to allow them to}} save themselves by submitting without being labeled as traitors. Neither Sigismund's army nor an alliance of Dalmatian cities and noblemen were able to counter Tvrtko's advances. Split, Zadar, and Šibenik having lost all hope, Tvrtko called upon them to negotiate their surrender in March 1389. Each of the cities asked to be the last one to submit and even to be allowed to request Sigismund's assistance once more. Tvrtko granted their wish and decided <b>that</b> <b>Split</b> should be the last to submit, by 15 June 1389.|$|E
5|$|Continuing east, M-102 intersects M-39 (Southfield Freeway) and M-10 (Lodge Freeway) {{south of}} the Southfield campus of Oakland Community College and the Northland Center Mall. As the highway {{approaches}} M-1 (Woodward Avenue), there are a pair of service drives <b>that</b> <b>split</b> from the main roadway in each direction to provide access through the interchange with M-1. The main lanes of M-102 pass under M-1 and its ramp connections before the service drives merge back in on the other side. This interchange is located adjacent to the Michigan State Fairgrounds, former site of the now-defunct Michigan State Fair, and Woodlawn Cemetery. East of the fairgrounds, the highway crosses a line of the Canadian National Railway that also carries Amtrak passenger traffic; the line is south of a rail terminal in Ferndale. Further east, M-102 meets I-75 before intersecting Dequindre Road. Dequindre is the boundary between Oakland and Macomb counties.|$|E

MD32 starts {{as a pair}} of two-lane flyover ramps <b>that</b> <b>split</b> west from northbound I-97 and join southbound I-97; the MD32 ramps head northwest while I-97 curves to the northeast and settles into the wide median of the northern end of MD3. After passing through its interchange with MD3, MD32 heads northwest as the Patuxent Freeway, a four-lane freeway that passes {{to the north of the}} community of Gambrills. The state highway's first interchange is with Sappington Station Road, a spur from the westbound ramps of MD32 that is unsigned MD32AA. The eastbound ramps connect with county-maintained Burns Crossing Road. MD32 continues northwest along the northern edge of Odenton, where the freeway gradually curves to the southwest, has a diamond interchange with MD170 (Telegraph Road) and a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD175 (Annapolis Road), and crosses over the Amtrak Northeast Corridor and MARC's Penn Line between the interchanges.|$|E
5|$|The Reuleaux {{triangle}} is {{the least}} symmetric curve of constant width according to two different measures of central asymmetry, the Kovner–Besicovitch measure (ratio of area to the largest centrally symmetric shape enclosed by the curve) and the Estermann measure (ratio of area to the smallest centrally symmetric shape enclosing the curve). For the Reuleaux triangle, the two centrally symmetric shapes that determine the measures of asymmetry are both hexagonal, although the inner one has curved sides. The Reuleaux triangle has diameters <b>that</b> <b>split</b> its area more unevenly than any other curve of constant width. That is, the maximum ratio of areas {{on either side of}} a diameter, another measure of asymmetry, is bigger for the Reuleaux triangle than for other curves of constant width.|$|E
5|$|Andrew II of Hungary was {{extremely}} favorably disposed towards the Templars. During {{his participation in}} the Fifth Crusade, he appointed Pontius de Cruce, Master of the Order in the Hungarian Kingdom, as a regent in Croatia and Dalmatia. After his return in 1219, {{in recognition of the}} great logistical and financial support which the Order had given him during the campaign, he granted the Order the estate of Gacka. Even before his departure from the city of Split in 1217, he had made over to the Templars the castle of Klis (Clissa), a strategic point in the hinterland of Split (Spalato), which controlled the approaches to the town. The king Andrew was reluctant to entrust the castle of Klis to any of the local magnates, knowing what great harm could come from that castle. It was the king's will <b>that</b> <b>Split</b> receive the castle of Klis for the defense of their city. The city of Split showed little interest in the royal favors, so the king entrusted Klis into Templars hands. Shortly after this, the Templars lost Klis, and, in exchange, the king gave them the coastal town of Šibenik (Sebenico).|$|E

5|$|The Sumatran {{rhinoceros}} {{is considered}} the least derived of the extant species, as it shares more traits with its Miocene ancestors. Paleontological evidence in the fossil record dates the genus Dicerorhinus to the Early Miocene, 23–16 million years ago. Many fossils have been classified as members of Dicerorhinus, but no other recent species are in the genus. Molecular dating suggests the split of Dicerorhinus from the four other extant species {{as far back as}} 25.9 ± 1.9 million years. Three hypotheses have been proposed for the relationship between the Sumatran rhinoceros and the other living species. One hypothesis suggests the Sumatran rhinoceros is closely related to the black and white rhinos in Africa, evidenced by the species having two horns, instead of one. Other taxonomists regard the Sumatran rhinoceros as a sister taxon of the Indian and Javan rhinoceros because their ranges overlap so closely. A third hypothesis, based on more recent analyses, however, suggests that the two African rhinos, the two Asian rhinos, and the Sumatran rhinoceros represent three essentially separate lineages <b>that</b> <b>split</b> around 25.9 million years ago; which group diverged first remains unclear.|$|E
