40|$|Ulf Büntgen [...] . [et. al. ]The Périgord {{black truffle}} is an {{exclusive}} culinary delicacy, but its Mediterranean harvests have declined, despite cultivation efforts since the 1970 s. The role of long-term irrigation, symbiotic fungus-host interaction, and microbial belowground progression remain poorly understood, because generally too short experimental settings miss the necessary degree of real world complexity and reliable information from truffle orchards is limited. Here, we conduct the first dendrochronological and wood anatomical assessment of 295 holm oaks, {{which have been}} growing under different irrigation intensities in the world's largest truffle orchard in Spain. The relationships between different climatic variables (monthly temperature means and precipitation totals) and dendro-parameters (ring width, vessel count and vessel size) of the oak hosts are utilized to disentangle direct and indirect drivers of truffle fruit body production. Irrigation at medium - instead of high - intensity is most beneficial for oak growth. Non-irrigated trees reveal overall lower stem increments. Warmer temperatures from February to April and wetter conditions from May to July enhance host vitality and possibly also its interplay with fungi symbionts via increased fine root production and mycorrhizal colonization. Adequately irrigated Mediterranean orchards may counteract some of the drought-induced natural truffle decline, and help stabilizing rural tourism, regional agriculture and global markets. © 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|Alpine treelines {{are often}} induced by a {{threshold}} of minimum temperatures above which tree growth {{is generally not}} possible anymore. However, this worldwide pattern may not account for more drought-prone mountains, where changes in precipitation can also affect ecosystem functioning and productivity at higher elevations. Here, we aim to determine if tree-ring formation in ecotones along the Pyrenees indeed primarily depends on temperature means or also reflects hydroclimatic changes. The mean duration of the growing season at Pyrenean treelines was 177 days, lasting from mid-May to early November, which corresponds to a mean root-zone temperature of 8. 2 °C. Temperatures during the early and late growing season were most critical for mountain pine growth at highest elevations, and above average spring temperatures also contributed to radial enlargement of tracheids. Sites showing more similar soil temperatures also presented more similar long-term growth trends indicating that local conditions trace regional influences on growth. Nevertheless, more wet conditions in summer enhanced growth at treelines subjected to more Mediterranean influence and therefore having a higher summer water deficit. A broader perspective reveals that soil moisture availability during spring and summer, however, also influence ring width formation at other treelines located in mid-latitude mountains separating temperate and semi-arid biomes. Our results suggest re-evaluating the idea of purely temperature-limited treelines, especially in mid-latitude mountains that experience moisture seasonality or where precipitation decreases with increasing elevation. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

40|$|Background and Purpose: The study aims at {{comparing}} two (over 100 years old) floodplain oak-predominated {{forests in}} <b>the</b> <b>Czech</b> <b>Republic</b> (<b>CZ)</b> with two in of Croatia (HR) with regards to: i) their structure and yield and, more specifically, ii) individual oak tree characteristics including acorn production. Materials and Methods: In both countries a different silvicultural concept is preferred (CZ: clear-cutting management with artificial regeneration, HR: shelterwood management with natural regeneration). The main research {{goal was to}} create a basic decision tool for forest managers and open some questions for future research. Results: Despite the different natural and management practices, the total standing volume of floodplain forest was found to be similar in both countries, ranging from 500 to 700 m 3 ·ha- 1 (basal area: 34 - 41 m 2 ·ha- 1). In CZ generally more poor structure diversity was detected. Although in CZ the number of crop oaks (130 - 160 oaks per hectare) was almost double as compared with HR, the CZ oaks had shorter crowns, almost twice smaller crown projection, lower mean volume and lower share of valuable assortments. Conclusions: Despite the total standing volume of oaks in HR being lower than in CZ, the total yield was observed in Croatia (loss in CZ ca. 22, 000 €·ha- 1). The acorn density and quality were generally higher in HR with a more even distribution as well. Despite more favourable climatic conditions in HR, the currently used management system in CZ floodplain forests should be gradually converted to the Croatian model with a multi-layered forest structure, more focused on individual tree growth and stability with high economical value and high reproductive potential...|$|E

40|$|The use of organic-inorganic hybrid nanocarriers for {{controlled}} release of anticancer drugs has been gained a great interest, in particular, {{to improve the}} selectivity and efficacy of the drugs. In this study, iron oxide nanoparticles were prepared then surface modified via diazonium chemistry and coated with chitosan, and its derivative chitosan-grafted polylactic acid. The purpose was to increase {{the stability of the}} nanoparticles in physiological solution, heighten drug-loading capacity, prolong the release, reduce the initial burst effect and improve in vitro cytotoxicity of the model drug doxorubicin. The materials were characterized by DLS, ζ-potential, SEM, TGA, magnetization curves and release kinetics studies. Results confirmed the spherical shape, the presence of the coat and the advantages of using chitosan, particularly its amphiphilic derivative, as a coating agent, thereby surpassing the qualities of simple iron oxide nanoparticles. The coated nanoparticles exhibited great stability and high encapsulation efficiency for doxorubicin, at over 500  μg per mg of carrier. Moreover, the intensity of the initial burst was clearly diminished after coating, hence represents an advantage of using the hybrid system over simple iron oxide nanoparticles.

40|$|Chronic {{hepatitis}} C is curable disease. Low detection rate {{could be}} one of the reasons of poor treatment uptake. It is important to identify HCV prevalence and anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) positive patients in population by effective screening strategy such as risk-based or birth cohort screening programs. There are no national population-based estimates of the HCV prevalence in <b>the</b> <b>Czech</b> <b>Republic</b> (<b>CZ).</b> The most recent seroprevalence survey determined a prevalence of positive anti-HCV antibodies of 0. 2 % (in 2001). The aim of the study was to determine the seroprevalence of HCV, HCV viraemia and HCV genotype in the CZ adult population. We also estimated the number of persons living with chronic hepatitis C in CZ. The examined group included 3000 adults, 18 - 90 years of age enrolled in 2015. All serum samples were examined to determined anti-HCV antibodies positivity, HCV-RNA positivity and genotypes. Of the 3000 samples, 50 were found to be anti-HCV-positive, for a seroprevalence of 1. 67 % (2. 39 % in males, 0. 98 % in females). The overall prevalence of positive HCV RNA was 0. 93 %: 1. 5 % in males, 0. 39 % in females. HCV genotype (GT) 1 a was determined in 25 %, GT 1 b in 25 % and GT 3 a in 46 %. Since 2001, the HCV seroprevalence has increased 8 -fold. The highest HCV seroprevalence occurred in males aged 30 - 44 years. We can estimate that there are more than 140, 000 people with HCV antibodies and more than 80, 000 people with chronic hepatitis C living in the CZ. The introduction of birth cohort HCV screening could be beneficial for the country...|$|E
40|$|Background/Objectives: A {{standardized}} methodology {{is important}} to enable consistent monitoring of dietary intake across European countries. For this reason, we evaluated the comparability of the assessment of usual food intake collected with two non-consecutive computerized 24 -h dietary recalls (24 -HDRs) and a food propensity questionnaire (FPQ) among five European centers. Subjects/Methods: Two 24 -HDRs using EPIC-Soft (the software developed to conduct 24 -HDRs in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) Study) were performed to determine fish, fruit and vegetable (FV) consumed by 600 adults in Belgium (BE), <b>the</b> <b>Czech</b> <b>Republic</b> (<b>CZ),</b> France (FR), the Netherlands (NL) and Norway (NO) in a validation study. An FPQ was used to identify non-consumers. Information from the 24 -HDRs and FPQ were used to estimate individual usual food intake by the Multiple Source Method (MSM). Blood samples were drawn to determine fatty acids in phospholipids and serum carotenoids as biomarkers of fish, and FV intake, respectively. Results: The pooled correlation between usual fish intake and eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid in phospholipids was 0. 19 in men and 0. 31 in women (P for heterogeneity > 0. 50) and center-specific correlations ranged between 0. 08 (CZ) and 0. 28 (BE and NO) in men, and between 0. 19 (BE) and 0. 55 (FR) in women. For usual FV intake, the pooled correlation with serum carotenoids was 0. 31 in men and 0. 40 in women (P for heterogeneity > 0. 10); the center-specific correlations varied between 0. 07 (NO) and 0. 52 (FR) in men, and between 0. 25 (NL) and 0. 45 (NO) in women. Conclusion: Two standardized 24 -HDRs using EPIC-Soft and an FPQ appeared to be appropriate to rank individuals according to their fish and FV intake in a comparable way among five European centers...|$|E
40|$|Background and objective: Risk/benefit {{profile of}} {{prescribed}} drug regimens is unkown. Over 60 % of commonly used medications interact on metabolic pathways (cytochrom P 450 (CYP 450), uridyl-glucuronyl tranferasis (UGT I, II) and P-glycoprotein (PGP) transport). Using an up-to-date knowledge on metabolic drug interactions, we aimed {{the study to}} determine the medication risk of commonly prescribed drug combinations. Design: A mathematical model was created to estimate the medication risk in various drug combinations considering (1) metabolic properties of medications prescribed in the sample, (2) medications' affinity to major and alternate metabolic pathways, (3) metabolic capacity of the enzymatic systems and their feasibility to inhibition or induction (CYP 2 C 19, CYP 3 A 4, CYP 2 D 6, CYP 2 C 8 / 9, CYP 1 A 2, UGT 1 and 2, PGP) and (4) medication potential to induct or inhibit metabolic pathways. The dataset of the EU ADHOC project (Aged in Home Care, 2001, 2003) was used, especially comprehensive medication data on the representative samples of home care elderly in <b>the</b> <b>Czech</b> <b>Republic</b> (<b>CZ),</b> Norway (NO) and Netherlands (NL); 1015 patients 65 (CZ= 430, NO= 388 and NL= 197). Main Outcome Measures: 1. Proportion of drug combinations with potentially harmful methabolic interactions; 2. medications having high potential to frequently reachtnigher plasmatic levels in various drug combinations (in o ver 90 % fo drug combinations); 3. medications having high potential to seriously increase drug level (about 95 % and more of expected level) in prescribed drug combinations. Results: Potentially harmful metabolics interaction were identified in 40 % (n= 460) of prescribed drug combinations (CZ 65. 8 %, NL 41, 1 %, NO 35. 6 %) mostly on CYP 3 A$ or CYP 2 D 2 metabolic pathways. High potential to frequently increase drug levels in various combinations was documented for omeprazol, glibenclamide, blimepiride, metoprolol, ibuprofen, dilthiazem, tolbutamide, flunitrazepam and zolpidem. Among medications which seriously increase drug levels in different drug combinations were determined: acetylsalicylic acidm, glipizid, nifedipin, metoprolol, omeprazol, amlopidin, ibuprofen, alprazolam, oxybutynin, flunitrazepam, glimepirid, thiaprofenic, acid, ciniarizin, verapamil and digoxin. Conclusions: Several commonly used medications were documented to frequently or seriously increase drug levels in prescribed drug combinations. Further {{studies are needed to}} support our findings.

40|$|In this work, nanocomplexes {{based on}} {{chitosan}} grafted by carboxy-modified polylactic acid (SPLA) were prepared {{with the aim}} of loading simultaneously two anticancer drugs – doxorubicin and 5 -fluorouracil, as well as to control their release, reduce the initial burst and boost cytotoxicity. The SPLA was prepared by a polycondensation reaction, using pentetic acid as the core molecule, and linked to the chitosan backbone through a coupling reaction. Nanocomplexes loaded with both drugs were formulated by the polyelectrolyte complexation method. The structure of the SPLA was characterized by 1 H NMR, while the product CS-SPLA was analyzed by FTIR-ATR to prove the occurrence of the reaction. Results showed that the diameters and ζ-potential of the nanocomplexes fall in the range 120 – 200 nm and 20 – 37 mV, respectively. SEM and TEM analysis confirmed the spherical shape and dimensions of the nanocomplexes. The presence of hydrophobic side chain SPLA did not influence the encapsulation efficiency of the drugs but strongly reduced the initial burst and prolonged release over time compared to unmodified chitosan. MS analysis showed that no degradation or interactions between the drugs and carrier were exhibited after loading or 24 h of release had taken place, confirming the protective role of the nanocomplexes. In vitro tests demonstrated an increase in the cytotoxicity of the drugs when loaded in the prepared carriers. © 2017 The Authors 15 - 08287 Y, GACR, Grantová Agentura České RepublikyCzech Science Foundation [15 - 08287 Y]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of <b>the</b> <b>Czech</b> <b>Republic</b> [LO 1504, <b>CZ.</b> 1. 05 / 2. 1. 00 / 19. 0409...|$|R
40|$|Speciation process often {{occurs in}} the face of {{hybridisation}} between forming species. Hybrid genomic constitution of many clonal organisms including fish, amphibians and reptiles also indicates tight linkage between hybridization, clonality and malfunction of sex in hybrids. To address the causal links between these phenomena, we investigated the evolution of asexuality and postzygotic reproductive isolation mechanisms (postRIMs) in the Cobitis loaches, which involves three sister species (C. taenia, C. pontica and C. tanaitica) and their distant relative, C. elongatoides. Interspecific crossings revealed that initiation of asexuality is causally linked to hybridization but does not require involvement of any particular genome. Rather, it depends on genetic distance between hybridizing parental taxa: crossings of distantly related elongatoides-taenia pair produced sterile males and fertile clonal females, while crossings of closely related species, C. pontica and C. taenia, produced fertile sexually reproducing hybrids of both sexes, with only rarely occurring clonal biotypes. Previous study of elongatoides-taenia hybrid zone together with current population genetic analysis of elongatoides-tanaitica hybrid zone demonstrated the completion of speciation: no BC or F 2 hybrids have been revealed and inferred F 1 hybrids were clonal. However, phylogenomic analysis revealed that gene flow between these species has been quite intensive in the past, leading to massive historical introgressions. Altogether, it appears that initiation of hybrid asexuality and the completion of speciation process through formation of postRIMs are interconnected phenomena. Both processes are linked to the genetic divergence of hybridizing taxa: initially, hybridization between little diverged species leads to recombinant and fertile hybrids allowing intensive gene flow. As the hybridizing taxa continue to diverge, clonally reproducing hybrid females and sterile males become dominant and the gene flow ceases. The speciation may therefore be completed through asexuality of hybrids The work was supported by grant no. 13 - 12580 S provided by <b>the</b> <b>Czech</b> Science Foundation (www. gacr. cz).
