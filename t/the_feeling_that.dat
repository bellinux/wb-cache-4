5|$|Emilio del Guercio {{said that}} the toy arrow {{represents}} absurdity and the teardrop sentimentality and melancholy. According to Argentine graphic artist Rep, the artwork conveys a grotesque, dramatic flavor and <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> the album should be taken seriously but not too seriously.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} between Pistrucci and William Wyon {{continued into the}} late 1840s, and sometimes featured in the press, contributing to <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> all was not well at the Mint. A Royal Commission on reform of the Royal Mint was appointed in 1848. Pistrucci submitted a report, in which he settled some old scores. The reforms abolished the positions of chief engraver (Wyon died in 1851) and chief medallist, with Pistrucci appointed a modeller and engraver to the Mint, to receive a salary in addition to payment for any work done.|$|E
5|$|This {{movement}} is prompted by <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> pervades {{the citizens of}} this State that in the present emergency the arms and munitions of war in the Arsenal should be {{under the control of the}} State authorities, in order to their security. This movement, although not authorized by me, has assumed such an aspect that it becomes my duty, as the executive of this Sate, to interpose my official authority to prevent a collision between the people of the State and the Federal troops under your command. I therefore demand in the name of the State the delivery of the possession of the Arsenal and munitions of war under your charge to the State authorities, to be held subject to the action of the convention to be held on the 4th of March next.|$|E

5|$|Named to the {{advisory}} group chosen {{to support the}} review board, Shea threw himself into the investigation, working eighty-hour weeks. Although the precise source of ignition was never found, {{it soon became clear}} that an electrical short somewhere in the command module had started the fire, probably sparked by a chafed wire. What was less clear was where to apportion responsibility. NASA engineers tended to point to what they saw as shoddy workmanship by North American Aviation. By contrast, North American executives blamed NASA management for its decision over their objections to pressurize the command module with pure oxygen to a pressure far in excess of that needed in space, in which almost any materialincluding Velcro, with which the cabin was filledwould instantly burst into flames if exposed to a spark. Whatever the precise distribution of responsibility, Shea remained haunted by <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> he, personally, was responsible for the deaths of three astronauts. For years after the fire, he displayed the portrait given to him by the Apollo 1 crew in the front hallway of his own home.|$|E
5|$|While the Giro had in its peloton many notable riders, {{including}} six former Grand Tour winners, the odds-on favorite was always 's Alberto Contador. The 2008 Giro champion, who had likewise won the 2008 Vuelta a España and three {{editions of the}} Tour de France, announced in April 2010 that he would contest the Giro in 2011. Though his status was put in doubt after a positive test for clenbuterol at the 2010 Tour de France, he was cleared by his national federation in February 2011 and {{able to return to}} racing, though the case still pended a final appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport later in 2011. Contador was the overwhelming favorite for overall victory. Reigning Giro champion Ivan Basso chose not to return, preferring to focus on the Tour de France later in the season. He briefly considered riding as a domestique for Vincenzo Nibali, but opted against it because of his physical condition at the time and <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> doing so would be disrespectful to the race. The 2011 Giro was thus the third successive edition, and fourth in the last five, in which the reigning champion did not return to defend his championship.|$|E
5|$|In November 2014, Adam is {{revealed}} to be recovering from multiple facial reconstruction surgeries, {{and is in the}} care of Sage Warner (Kelly Sullivan). When Adam is told of Chelsea and Billy's new relationship, he attempts to leave his current dwelling, with Sage assuring him that he is not ready and that any attempt to leave would only compromise the progress of the surgeries he'd recently had. Adam eventually recovers enough to have the bandages removed from his face; after the bandages are removed it {{is revealed}} that his face had been replaced by Gabriel Bingham; the man who died saving Adam's life, he returns to Genoa City with Sage, he comes across the people he knows, but none of them recognize Adam or get <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> they know him somehow. Adam, under the alias of Gabriel, would pose as being married to Sage, in a ruse to claim Gabe's inheritance from Constance, however, they would later divorce in April 2015. He would reconnect with Chelsea, whom he confessed his true identity, and would slowly begin to piece their life back together, with plans to relocate to Paris, until Victor stepped in to sue for custody of Connor, keeping them in Genoa City. In October 2015, Adam's true identity was revealed and would help Sage deliver his nephew in Chancellor Park, following a heated confrontation between the two. Adam would stand trial for his role in Delia's death. He was sentenced for ten years, and upon leaving the courthouse, was run over by an unknown assailant. Christine found out that the car is found at the south lake motel. The car was found out to be a rental and Kevin found a surveillance picture that showed that Chloe was behind the pedal to the metal. Adam regains consciousness after the surgery, and expresses no ill will towards Chloe.|$|E

25|$|Pittsburgh {{entered the}} game as seven-point {{favorites}} over Arizona. Major factors for this included {{the view that the}} Steelers' defense was better than that of the Cardinals and <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> the AFC was an overall better conference than the NFC.|$|E
25|$|Of all {{the reasons}} Lori and Corey found for {{creating}} a bridge between Trial by Fire and Shadows of Darkenss, the most compelling was <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> the Hero character simply hadn't matured enough to face the very grim challenges awaiting him in Transylvania.|$|E
25|$|Gay travel {{destinations}} {{are popular}} among practitioners of gay tourism because they usually have permissive or liberal attitudes towards gays, feature a prominent gay infrastructure (bars, businesses, restaurants, hotels, nightlife, entertainment, media, organisations, etc.), {{the opportunity to}} socialize with other gays, and <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> one can relax safely among other gay people.|$|E

25|$|Lurie's {{response}} {{after reading}} Merrill and Jackson's collaborative effort in The Changing Light at Sandover: “I sometimes had <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> my friend's mind was intermittently being {{taken over by}} a stupid and possibly even evil intelligence”. According to Stoker Hunt, author of Ouija: The Most Dangerous Game, before his death Merrill warned {{against the use of}} the Ouija board.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{treatment}} {{is similar to}} atrophic rhinitis, namely keeping the nasal mucosa moist with saline or oil-based lubricants and treating pain and infection as they arise; adding menthol to lubricants may be helpful in ENS, as may be use of a cool mist humidifer at home. For people with anxiety, depression, or who are obsessed with <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> they can't breathe, psychiatric or psychological care may be helpful.|$|E
25|$|By far, the {{two most}} common {{symptoms}} described are pain and <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> teeth no longer correctly meet (traumatic malocclusion, or disocclusion). The teeth {{are very sensitive to}} pressure (proprioception), so even a small change in the location of the teeth will generate this sensation. People will also be very sensitive to touching the area of the jaw that is broken, {{or in the case of}} condylar fracture the area just in front of the tragus of the ear.|$|E

25|$|TOT {{states should}} be {{separated}} from FOK (feeling of knowing) states. FOK, in contrast, is <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> one {{will be able to}} recognize - from a list of items - an item that is currently inaccessible. There are still currently opposing articles of the separability of the process underlying these concepts. However, {{there is some evidence that}} TOTs and FOKs draw on different parts of the brain. TOTs are associated with the anterior cingulate, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and right inferior cortex while FOKs are not.|$|E
25|$|The architects {{wanted the}} {{building}} to give Bloomington residents <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> the courthouse belonged to them. To encourage this feeling the entrances on all four sides of the building are identical, a way to welcome people from all directions. Wanting to balance the feeling of symmetry {{with a sense of}} power Reeves and Baile created an identical hierarchy in each facade through the use of an entrance arch, enhanced vertically by columns and topped off with a pediment. The exterior also makes use of many balustrades in the roof and other levels on the exterior. Also included are detailed egg-and-dart molding, and hood molding.|$|E
25|$|I {{always had}} <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> no one {{understood}} me anyway, {{that no one}} knew who I was and what made me do this or that. And you know, when no one understands you, no one can call you to account. Not even the court could call me to account. But the dead can. They understand. They don't even have to have been there, but if they do, they understand even better. Here in prison they were with me a lot. They came every night, whether I wanted them to or not. Before the trial I could still chase them away when they wanted to come.|$|E

5000|$|Lightfoot has cited {{his divorce}} for inspiring the lyrics, saying {{they came to}} him as he was sitting in a vacant Toronto house one summer.

25|$|Along with Chris and Shaz, it is {{revealed}} that Ray Carling had previously {{died in the}} real world. As a young DC, he commits suicide by hanging himself on 6 May 1972, the day of that year's FA Cup Final. He had been struggling with <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> he had failed his father and grandfathers, who were all army sergeants, after he failed basic training for entry to the British Army. Ray took out his frustrations on a drunk young man outside a pub and ended up killing him, something which his DCI covered up. Ridden with guilt, he committed suicide by hanging himself in a bout of severe depression and alcohol abuse.|$|E
25|$|Also in {{the summer}} of 1967, urban residents, {{primarily}} African Americans, rioted for 5 days in Newark and the neighboring city of Plainfield. These two riots are known as the 1967 Newark riots and the 1967 Plainfield riots. The cause was <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> African Americans were being disenfranchised. 26 people died in the Newark riots, and nearly 1,600 were arrested. The riots are often cited as {{a major factor in the}} decline of Newark and its neighboring communities, as many residents fled to the suburbs following the riots. Race related violence would continue to plague the state with smaller riots occurring in Trenton in 1968, Camden in 1969, and Asbury Park in 1970.|$|E
25|$|On 16 May 1901, Ament {{addressing}} {{guests at}} the third annual Asiatic Society of America dinner in New York, again defended himself and his fellow missionaries:The missionaries in China, of whom I am proud to be one, represent a class of American citizens whose work in the Orient have been purposefully misrepresented....The missionaries' words have been twisted, wring interpretations made. The persistency of work like this can only justify <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> the root of this un-American warfare is due, {{not so much to}} what is seen or known of the deeds of missionaries, but the opposition to Christianity itself. The purpose was fixed before China was reached at all, and this murderous spirit stops not at injustice to individuals.|$|E
30|$|Stage 6 : Systematic {{analysis}} of the transference. The entire process, including each defence, is repeatedly recapitulated to bring the patient insight into his entire defensive system and <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> have been dissociated beneath the resistance.|$|R
60|$|Joe hesitated again--could he trust her? Yes; <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> {{filled her}} breast and {{prompted}} {{her words were}} not those of the Indian just now--they were those of a mother, whose gratitude was too full for utterance.|$|R
