His only regular sources of income were voice-overs, and publishing magazines about his former show which he [...] "made {{quite a lot of}} money out of". He lost most of his profits investing in a failed children's magazine. In 1999, he was cast in the American TV film First Daughter, which was filmed in Australia. After discovering he could perform a convincing American accent, Dale attended the film's premiere, finally moving with his family to the United States permanently in January 2000. Dale, his second wife Tracey, and their then two-year-old son Nick moved into an [...] "awful little flat" [...] in Los Angeles and found an agent.

Even if we fail, we'll have learned something. But more important than that, something has to be done. People like myself can't go around making nice speeches all the time. We can't just keep raising expectations. We have to do some damn hard work, too." ...|$|E

He supervised the disposal of thousands of sheep which were culled on site or brought there from Carlisle abattoir. He said at the time:The Army is here to set up systems to deal with the problem.

We're not quite sure if <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> the way we're doing it, but we want to try to create this family dynamic we're aware of and create this family around it'", he recalled. [...] "And their hesitancy of whether it would work or not... made me, thinking back on it, realize they were into it 110% because they were trying to create something new. I didn’t know what would happen with it or where it could go... But I was like, I’m in." ...|$|E

5000|$|Gordon Murray the Formula 1 and Mclaren F1 designer, {{said when}} {{designing}} his new Murray T.25 city car:"I discovered why people didn't make {{what they call}} 'Sub A' segment cars, small city cars - you don't make any money on them. Because the tooling and development cost for a small car is almost {{the same as for}} a bigger car. So people would rather build larger cars and make more profit. That's when I started thinking, that if <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> {{there needs to be a}} new way of making the cars, that is cost effective. That high capital pressed components using low labour cost countries a long distance from developed world markets has a large environmental cost. Car manufacturers say that production emissions are small compared to tailpipe emissions, but in fact they are a very significant proportion of total emissions. We need to re-think the Henry Ford design of mass production." [...] Murray's solution is a laser cut tubular steel space-frame chassis built with an automated tube mill, braced with bonded low-cost composite sheets that would be a cheaper and greener means of production. Murray's 'iStream' simplifies each process with an eighty percent smaller factory with lower cost production, making light weight efficient cars. There are no sheet metal presses, spot welders or paint plants. It would be built local to its market. Murray is currently negotiating production licences. The T25 and T27 were expected to be available in 2016.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first game}} in the early {{learning}} software series JumpStart, JumpStart Kindergarten, was created in 1994 by independent developer Fanfare Software (founded 1988) and published by Knowledge Adventures (founded 1991). Fanfare developed two more games JumpStart Preschool and JumpStart 1st Grade before being acquired by Knowledge Adventure in August 9, 1995. Fanfare founder and chairman Barton Listick became vice president of Knowledge Adventure, while his staff relocated to Knowledge Adventure's headquarters in Glendale. Knowledge Adventure founder Bill Gross hoped the acquisition would allow the JumpStart series to expand into international markets, as well as multiple platforms, on-line, and the Internet, to supplement the home and school markets. Meanwhile, Listick was optimistic that the added resources of the larger organisation {{would allow him to}} create a [...] "JumpStart Elementary School" [...] of compelling and exciting children's software. Microtimes retrospectively wrote that the acquisition of the early learning products augmented Knowledge Adventure's strengths. In October, Steve Chadima, vice president of marketing services at Knowledge Adventure said that while JumpStart sales were strong, and the series was about to be extended with JumpStart Second Grade, he said: [...] "We're testing concepts for third grade to see if it is viable...I don't know if <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with higher grade levels." [...] JumpStart Adventures 3rd Grade: Mystery Mountain would end up being released in 1996, and many higher grade games followed. According to Chicago Sun-Times, Knowledge Adventure [...] "started the baby trend when it introduced JumpStart Toddler in 1996". On February 3, 1997, the privately held Knowledge Adventure was acquired by CUC International, becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the CUC Software division alongside Davidson, Blizzard Entertainment, and Sierra On-Line; CUC Software would be the label that marketed the JumpStart games. JumpStart Typing, JumpStart Spanish, JumpStart Kindergarten II, JumpStart 1st Grade Reading, JumpStart 1st Grade Math, JumpStart 2nd Grade Math and JumpStart 5th Grade were premiered at the 1997 E3.|$|E
5000|$|Production {{began in}} 2014, but {{the project was}} delayed for eight months due to bassist Flea {{suffering}} a broken arm sustained while snowboarding. Anthony Kiedis said:We had an unusually difficult experience making this record, where we wrote 20 to 30 songs {{and it was all}} ready to go and we thought it was happening, and then Flea went snowboarding and broke his arm real bad, which {{was a bit of a}} setback... So we re-thought everything and then we didn’t have a producer and we were just sort of lost in space with all these songs. And lo and behold it was meant to be, as these things can be, and when all the dust settled Brian Burton, aka Danger Mouse, emerged and said, [...] "Let's go make a record". We we're like [...] "Great, we have all these songs" [...] and he was like [...] "Leave those there, let's go write new songs in the studio." [...] Initially there was an affinity and a marriage to all these other songs, but the only way that we saw this working was to have trust in him and get rid of our old ideas and our old way of doing things and say [...] "If <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> we just have to throw ourselves off the cliff and see what happens".Kiedis, in a May 9, 2016 interview on BBC Radio 2, said that lyrically many of the songs were influenced by a two-year relationship [...] "that completely fell apart like a nuclear bomb," [...] and that his favorite song is [...] "The Getaway". Chad Smith, in a May 17, 2016 radio interview, said the band loved Rick Rubin but wanted to work with someone different this time; that it was important to change producers and be inspired in a different way. Smith also said [...] "We Turn Red" [...] was one of his favorite songs and that [...] "Go Robot", a funky song he also loves, might be a single. In an interview with Pearl Jam's Mike McCready which was recorded in late April 2016 however aired on Sirius XM on May 18, 2016, Flea said that [...] "Go Robot" [...] was going to be the first single and described the song as a funny, funky, up-tempo jam and inspired by the Prince song [...] "Controversy". In that same interview, Chad said that Josh Klinghoffer plays bass on [...] "The Hunter" [...] and that it was the only song on the album where Flea did not play on. Smith described Klinghoffer's playing as sounding like Paul McCartney. The band confirmed during an album preview show on May 26, 2016 that the previously reported information of Elton John appearing on the album was true and that he plays piano on [...] "Sick Love". John and longtime collaborator Bernie Taupin have a writing credit on the song. Anna Waronker, best known for being the singer of That Dog, provides vocals on [...] "The Getaway". In a June 7, 2016 interview, Kiedis said that Danger Mouse was the reason [...] "Dark Necessities" [...] became the first single. The band had pushed for [...] "The Getaway" [...] to be the first single while management and the record label wanted [...] "Go Robot". [...] "Encore" [...] originally started out as an instrumental jam and was performed for the first time on the I'm With You Tour.|$|E
