Ethernet passive {{optical network}} (EPON) has been {{considered}} to solve <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> bottleneck <b>problem.</b> In an effort to accommodate the explosive bandwidth demands from subscribers, the optical line terminal (OLT) efficiently divides and allocates time slots for data upstream to all optical network units (ONUs) in EPON. This technology {{is expected to be}} a core in the future fiber-to-the-home/-office/-curb (FTTH/O/C). We study previous algorithms for dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) in interleaved polling with adaptive cycle time (IPACT). For effective bandwidth allocation of the uplink channel, we propose an adaptive window-tuning algorithm (AdWin) based on the excessive bandwidth. This algorithm not only satisfies bandwidth demands of ONUs within the possible scope, but also seeks fairness among ONUs. The comprehensive computer simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme is up to 94 % and 94 % lower than previous schemes in terms of average packet delay and average queue size, respectively. It also demonstrates up to 86 % improved performance in regards to packet loss ratio. ...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: Wavelength-Division-Multiplexing (WDM) is a {{promising}} technique {{for meeting the}} growing demand for increased bandwidth and various types of services in the optical access network. For wide area or metropolitan networks, fibers are deployed to provide huge bandwidth. In access networks, the fiber-to-the-home will partially solve <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> <b>problem.</b> However, some environmentally sensitive area such as housing areas, tower buildings and national parks {{are not allowed to}} deploy fibers. Therefore, Radio Frequency (RF) is normally used to overcome this problem. The incompatibility of RF and optical channels is now widely believed to be the limiting factor in efforts to further increase transport capabilities. Free Space Optical (FSO) communication is the technology that can address any connectivity needed in optical networks, such as core, edge, or access networks. Approach: In this project, the simulation software namely Optical System version 7 is used to simulate the design of WDM in FSO transmission. The total losses that have been considered in this design are geometric loss, transmitter and receiver loss and atmospheric attenuation which focus on nonselective scattering during heavy rainfall condition in Malaysian environment. Malaysian weather data are used to reflect the conditions particularly in tropical regions. Results: We have presented the results of 16 -channels WDM at 100 -GHz channel spacing. The simulated results show that this system can support a higher bit rate up to 2. 5 Gbps over 2. 4 km distance.

40|$|In {{the past}} decades, mobile traffic {{generated}} by {{devices such as}} smartphones, iphones, laptops and mobile gateways has been growing rapidly. While traditional direct connection techniques evolve to provide better access to the Internet, {{a new type of}} wireless network, mobile ad hoc network (MANET), has emerged. A MANET differs from a direct connection network in the way that it is multi-hopping and self-organizing and thus able to operate without the help of prefixed infrastructures. However, challenges such dynamic topology, unreliable wireless links and resource constraints impede the wide applications of MANETs. Routing in a MANET is complex because it has to react efficiently to unfavourable conditions and support traditional IP services. In addition, Quality of Service (QoS) provision is required to support the rapid growth of video in mobile traffic. As a consequence, tremendous efforts have been devoted to the design of QoS routing in MANETs, leading to the emergence of a number of QoS support techniques. However, the application independent nature of QoS routing protocols results {{in the absence of a}} one-for-all solution for MANETs. Meanwhile, the relative importance of QoS metrics in real applications is not considered in many studies. A Best Effort QoS support (BEQoS) routing model which evaluates and ranks alternative routing protocols by considering the relative importance of multiple QoS metrics is proposed in this thesis. BEQoS has two algorithms, SAW-AHP and FPP for different scenarios. The former is suitable for cases where uncertainty factors such as standard deviation can be neglected while the latter considers uncertainty of the problems. SAW-AHP is a combination of Simple Additive Weighting and Analytic Hierarchical Process in which the decision maker or network operator is firstly required to assign his/her preference of metrics with a specific number according to given rules. The comparison matrices are composed accordingly, based on which the synthetic weights for alternatives are gained. The one with the highest weight is the optimal protocol among all alternatives. The reliability and efficiency of SAW-AHP are validated through simulations. An integrated architecture, using evaluation results of SAW-AHP is proposed which incorporates the ad hoc technology into the existing WLAN and therefore provides a solution for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> access <b>problems.</b> <b>The</b> protocol selection induced cost and gains are also discussed. The thesis concludes by describing the potential application area of the proposed method. Fuzzy SAW-AHP is extended to accommodate the vagueness of the decision maker and complexity of problems such as standard deviation in simulations. The fuzzy triangular numbers are used to substitute the crisp numbers in comparison matrices in traditional AHP. Fuzzy Preference Programming (FPP) is employed to obtain the crisp synthetic weight for alternatives based on which they are ranked. The reliability and efficiency of SAW-FPP are demonstrated by simulations. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

There are really many home system producers in the world (Smart Home Systems, EIB-Konnex, Lonworks, Bticino, Vimar, Duemmegi, EasyDom Corporation, Futurware, Digital Cybermasters, Hills Home Systems, Intellihome etc, just to mention a few), and their products differ from each others in many characteristics, such as functionality, dimension, weight, typology of installation, materials, net topology, power consumes, aesthetic appearance, communication protocol and communication mean. Regarding this <b>last</b> point, <b>the</b> majority of the domotic systems, especially in Europe, tend to use a dedicated bus cable to exchange data among modules, to make the communication link more robust and reliable. Lately, using radio communication is in fashion, but radio modules, respect to their equivalent standard ones, are more expensive, and in the bargain many people don’t want to use them due to the fear of radio signals (even if it were proved that they are completely harmless). Another communication mean, that is often not taken into account, is the powerline. In point of fact, using the installed poweline wires to send information is a very smart idea: there is no additional cost to install other dozens of meters of wires, there is not the necessity to break the walls and to do building works at home, there are no interferences with other devices (like in the radio communication case) or reflection problems (like in the infrared case), there is the possibility to put the modules in every place (it is sufficient to have an electrical socket in the nearness, or to use an extension cable), {{there is no need to}} have an extra power source (usually, in a bus cable domotic system, there is a direct voltage generated by a power supply and distribuited on the whole domotic net). Moreover, powerline communication (PLC, also called BPL in the USA, where the acronym stays for Broadband over Power Line, or NPL, Narroband over Power Line) is not only used in a home environment to create a virtual net among domotic modules, but is also used on the power distribution net to perform actions like reading the electricity meter, monitoring the power consumes and the state of a building, finding faults along the net, detecting illegal electricity usages and to solve <b>the</b> so-called <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> <b>problem,</b> that is <b>the</b> problem related to the final leg of delivering connectivity from a communications provider to a customer. In fact a cheap possibility to cover this final leg is using powerline communication. The intent of this work is therefore to illustrate, going into more details, advantages and disadvantages of the powerline communication systems (PLCS), to show the differences between PLCS for power distribution net and PLCS for home and building environments, to indagate the methods to send data over the powerline, to explain which are the automations that is possible to connect and to control in a powerline domotic system and to show some case studies tackled by the authors...|$|R
