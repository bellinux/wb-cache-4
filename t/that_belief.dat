5|$|Heffernan v. City of Paterson, 578 U.S. ___ (2016), was a United States Supreme Court case in 2016 {{concerning}} the First Amendment rights of public employees.

5|$|Favorinus {{argued that}} it was absurd to imagine that stars and planets would affect human bodies {{in the same way as}} they affect the tides, and equally absurd that small motions in the heavens cause large changes in people's fates.

Carneades argued <b>that</b> <b>belief</b> in fate denies free will and morality; that people born at different times can all die in the same accident or battle; and that contrary to uniform influences from the stars, tribes and cultures are all different.|$|E

40|$|Philosophers {{commonly}} say <b>that</b> <b>beliefs</b> come in degrees. Drawing {{from the}} literature, I make precise three arguments for this claim: an argument from degrees of confidence, an argument from degrees of firmness, and an argument from natural language.

I also advance three arguments <b>that</b> <b>beliefs</b> do not come in degrees: an argument from natural language, an argument from intuition, and an argument from the metaphysics of degrees.

5|$|Plantinga's {{version of}} the defence embraces Augustine's view of free will, but not his natural theology. Rather than attempt to show the {{existence}} of God as likely {{in the face of}} evil, as a theodicy does, Plantinga's free will defence attempts to show <b>that</b> <b>belief</b> in God is still logically possible, despite the existence of evil. Theologian Alister McGrath has noted that, because Plantinga only argued that the coexistence of God and evil are logically possible, he did not present a theodicy, but a defence. Plantinga did not attempt to demonstrate that his proposition is true or plausible, just that it is logically possible.|$|E
5|$|Many {{critics have}} {{challenged}} the second premise of this argument, {{by offering a}} biological and sociological account {{of the development of}} human morality which suggests that it is neither objective nor absolute. This account, supported by biologist E. O. Wilson and philosopher Michael Ruse, proposes that the human experience of morality is a by-product of natural selection, a theory philosopher Mark D. Linville calls evolutionary naturalism. According to the theory, the human experience of moral obligations was the result of evolutionary pressures, which attached a sense of morality to human psychology because it was useful for moral development; this entails that moral values do not exist independently of the human mind. Morality might be better understood as an evolutionary imperative in order to propagate genes and ultimately reproduce. No human society today advocates immorality, such as theft or murder, because it would undoubtedly lead to the end of that particular society and any chance for future survival of offspring. Scottish empiricist David Hume made a similar argument, <b>that</b> <b>belief</b> in objective moral truths is unwarranted and to discuss them is meaningless.|$|E

50|$|A {{belief system}} {{is a set of}} {{mutually}} supportive beliefs.

50|$|In principle, foundationalism holds <b>that</b> basic <b>beliefs</b> {{unilaterally}} support derived beliefs, {{with support}} always directed {{from the former}} to the latter; coherentism holds <b>that</b> <b>beliefs</b> mutually support each other when they {{belong to the same}} coherent belief-set. As these theories were refined, however, some foundationalists began to admit <b>that</b> even basic <b>beliefs</b> could be fallible, and <b>that</b> derived <b>beliefs</b> could mutually support each other; whereas some coherentists began to admit <b>that</b> experiential <b>beliefs</b> should be weighted so as to reflect realistic degrees of coherence or justification. So the rival theories began to lean closer together. Moreover, those foundationalists who wondered why there couldn't be mutual support between basic and derived beliefs were in danger of falling into coherentism. Those coherentists who wondered why experiential beliefs should be weighted more heavily than others were also falling into foundationalism.|$|R

25|$|Baumeister {{and colleagues}} {{also note that}} volunteers disbelieving in free will are less capable of {{counterfactual}} thinking.

Again, this cannot be taken to mean <b>that</b> <b>belief</b> in determinism is to blame; these are the results we would expect from increasing people's belief in fatalism.|$|E
40|$|Executive beliefs {{influence}} {{strategic decision}} making in organizations, and thus they ultimately influence organization performance.

40|$|Attributions {{for sexual}} {{orientation}} strongly predict opposition to gay rights policies; however, we propose <b>that</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> {{gays and lesbians}} violate important values drive gay rights opposition and account {{for the relationship between}} attributions and anti-gay discrimination. In two studies, we found <b>that</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> gays and lesbians violate values accounted for much of the relationship between attributions and anti-gay discrimination. In addition, these stereotypes were the most powerful predictors of opposition to gay rights when both value violations and attributions were included in the model. Results also demonstrated that violations of specific values predicted opposition to policies relevant to those values. This suggests that attributions of choice over sexual orientation are less relevant for predicting opposition to gay rights than beliefs about choice to uphold or violate values...|$|R

25|$|The ideas {{associated}} with reincarnation may have arisen independently in different regions, {{or they might}} have spread {{as a result of}} cultural contact.

40|$|This paper {{critically}} examines two objections {{and raises}} a new objection against the besire theory of moral judgment. Firstly, Smith (1994) observes <b>that</b> a <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> p tends to expire whereas a desire that p tends to endure on {{the perception that}} not p. His observation does not refute the sophisticated version of the besire theory that to besire that p is to believe that p and to desire to act {{in accordance with the}} <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> p. Secondly, Zangwill (2008) claims that the strength of motivation may vary while the degree of belief remains constant. Besirists would reply that a besire admits of both degree and strength. Finally, I argue <b>that</b> the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> p endures while the desire to act on the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> p expires with the introduction of a new bodily condition, and hence <b>that</b> the <b>belief</b> and the desire are distinct mental states...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT—Using recent research, I argue <b>that</b> <b>beliefs</b> lie at {{the heart}} of {{personality}} and adaptive functioning and that they give us unique insight into how personality and functioning can be changed. I focus on two classes of beliefs—beliefs about the malleability of self-attributes and expectations of social acceptance versus rejection—and show how modest interventions have brought about important real-world changes. I conclude by suggesting <b>that</b> <b>beliefs</b> are central to the way in which people package their experiences and carry them forward, and <b>that</b> <b>beliefs</b> should play a more central role in the study of personality.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the view <b>that</b> desires are <b>beliefs</b> about normative reasons for action. It describes the view, and briefly sketches three arguments for it.

25|$|Alvin Plantinga is a Christian {{analytic}} philosopher {{known for}} his free will defense {{with respect to the}} logical problem of evil, the evolutionary argument against naturalism, the position <b>that</b> <b>belief</b> in the existence of God is properly basic, and his modal version of the ontological argument for the existence of God.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1880s, Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch, an {{influential}} {{leader in the}} early opposition to non-Orthodox forms of Judaism, wrote that while he did not endorse the idea of common descent (that all life developed from one common organism), even if science ever did prove the factuality of Evolution, it would not {{pose a threat to}} Orthodox Judaism's beliefs.
