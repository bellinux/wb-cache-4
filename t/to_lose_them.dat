5|$|Unbeknown to Bompart's force, Humbert's {{army and}} the {{rebellion}} as a whole had been defeated by the British Army a week before Bompart departed France. Bompart's squadron too was woefully understrength consisting of only a single ship {{of the line and}} eight frigates carrying 3,000 men. This small force faced {{a large proportion of the}} British Channel Fleet, which was prepared for a second invasion attempt after Humbert's army had landed unopposed in August. As a result, Bompart's force was spotted just a few hours after he left Brest and he was then chased into the Atlantic Ocean by several British frigates which followed him for a week until he was able <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>them</b> in heavy weather. This weather persisted throughout the campaign, causing significant damage to both sides in a series of storms.|$|E
5|$|United {{suffered}} {{the agony of}} reaching {{three out of four}} Scottish Cup finals in the mid-1980s, only <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>them</b> all by a single goal. First came a 2–1 defeat to Celtic in 1984–85, compounded by a 1–0 League Cup final loss to Rangers in the same season; then a 1–0 defeat in extra time to St Mirren in 1986–87; and finally, a last-minute 2–1 loss against Celtic the following year, despite being a goal ahead. A three-year gap ensued before the 1990–91 Scottish Cup final, which pitted Jim McLean against his brother Tommy, at Motherwell. The final was won 4–3 by 'Well, with United again losing in extra time. The sixth Cup Final loss was also the club's fifth final appearance in eleven years.|$|E

Atoms tend to get smaller toward the right in the periodic table, and become much larger at the next line of the table. Atoms {{to the right of the}} table tend to gain electrons, while atoms to the left tend <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>them.</b> Every element on the last column of the table is chemically inert (noble gas).|$|E

He entered the University of Berlin, where he listed to lectures by Max Planck, Walther Bothe and Walther Nernst. Fellow students included Kurt Hirsch and Käte Sperling. The physics laboratory classes were overcrowded, so the first year students were encouraged to take theoretical physics courses instead. Peierls found that he liked the subject.|$|E

25|$|In 2014 some Mexican wrestling media sources {{reported}} that Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) {{was interested in}} signing El Hijo del Ninja to a contract, but nothing substantial came of the rumors at the time. In 2015 El Hijo del Ninja and his cousin Último Ninja won the LyC Tag Team championship, only <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>them</b> to the team of lucha libre legends Dr. Wagner Jr. and Silver King, {{as part of an}} ongoing storyline feud between the Garza family and La Dinastia Wagner. The storyline led to a six-man steel cage match where El Hijo del Ninja, El Ninja Jr. and Último Ninja took on Dr. Wagner Jr. El Hijo del Dr. Wagner Jr. and Silver King Jr., with the last man in the cage being forced to unmask. In the end El Hijo del Ninja was the last man to escape the cage, while Silver King Jr. was left in the ring and thus had to unmask as a result. During the spring of 2016 Garza Jr. was invited to the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida as part of WWE's research for their upcoming Cruiserweight Classic, but ended up not participating in the tournament.

25|$|In 1986, Tanaka {{moved to}} Memphis, Tennessee {{where he worked}} for Jerry Lawler and Jerry Jarrett’s Continental Wrestling Association. Early on Tanaka teamed with Jeff Jarrett to win the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship. In late 1986 the tag-team {{specialist}} Tanaka was teamed up with Paul Diamond, who was also seen as a tag-team specialist, to form Badd Company, where they held the promotion's tag-team titles four times., a move that paid off pretty soon as the two won the CWA/AWA International Tag Team Championship, beating Tarzan Goto and Akio Sato on December 15, 1986. The first reign was short lived as The Sheepherders (Luke Williams and Butch Miller) defeated the duo on January 10, 1987. Badd Company quickly regained the titles only <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>them</b> to Tarzan Goto and Akio Sato on February 5, 1987. The third reign with the tag-team titles came on May 9, 1987 when the team beat Mark Starr in a handicap match, but lost them back to Starr and his new tag team partner Billy Joe Travis. Badd Company had one last run with the International tag team titles as they won the vacant titles on May 25, 1987 and held them until July 6, 1987 where they lost the titles to Bill Dundee and Rocky Johnson (who were the last International tag team champions).|$|E

Kubica was {{catching}} Button at a high rate of knots but it seemed a long shot if Button was going <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>them</b> two points.

Hamilton came second, while Finn Räikkönen came home in third. Kovalainen came fourth, while Nico Rosberg had a reasonably quiet race as he came home in fifth. Fernando Alonso came sixth in his home race, championship leader Jenson Button came seventh, while Robert Kubica came eighth, only his second points scoring finish so far this season. Neither Red Bull's Vettel or Webber scored a point, while Barrichello moved into second place in the drivers championship. Button kept his lead although he only added two points to his tally. Brawn edged further ahead in the constructors' championship by scoring 12 points with Red Bull not scoring a single point this weekend.|$|E

The team lost the titles back to Goto and Sato less than 2 weeks later. In late 1986, the tag team {{specialist}} Diamond was teamed up with Pat Tanaka, who was also seen as a tag team specialist, to form Badd Company.

25|$|Kepford's {{next big}} day arrived on 19 February. VF-17 was {{assigned}} fighter escort duty, shepherding single engine bombers to strikes on Lakunai Airfield. Kepford was again assigned as division leader, {{this time for}} one of two groups flying high cover. His wingman had engine problems and was quickly forced to return to Piva. Arriving at the target site, Kepford decided there was enough fighter cover {{and that he was}} too vulnerable without a wingman, so he too headed back for home base. En route, he spotted a Rufe flying low on the water. Kepford pounced on the vulnerable float plane and easily shot it down. Immediately after, a mass of 20 or so enemy fighters spotted Kepford flying alone beneath them and dove on the vulnerable pilot. He was quickly penned in by four enemy aircraft and forced to head north, away from his base. He used his plane's water injection—a new feature installed on a small number of Corsairs—to help him pull as far ahead of the enemies as possible, but the device worked fitfully. He tried <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>them</b> flying low over land, without success. Deciding he was moving too far afield to return to base on remaining fuel reserves, Kepford quickly cut to the left and reversed direction south over the water. The plane following Kepford on the left side attempted to turn inside to shoot him down, but the pilot misjudged his altitude and struck his wing into the water below, crashing. Those on the right side lost too much ground when Kepford reversed, so they gave up the chase.|$|E
