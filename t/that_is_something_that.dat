2500|$|In {{differential}} topology, sphere eversion is {{the process}} of turning a sphere inside out in a three-dimensional space. (The word [...] means [...] "turning inside out".) Remarkably, it is possible to smoothly and continuously turn a sphere inside out in this way (with possible self-intersections) without cutting or tearing it or creating any crease. This is surprising, both to non-mathematicians and to those who understand regular homotopy, and can be regarded as a veridical paradox; <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that,</b> while being true, on first glance seems false.|$|E

2500|$|In the High-elven tongue Quenya, {{the word}} for [...] "Orc" [...] was urco, plural urqui, meaning [...] "bogey", or [...] "bogeyman", <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> provokes fear. In the Grey-elven tongue Sindarin, it was orch, plural yrch. In the Dwarven tongue Khuzdul, it was rukhs, plural rakhâs. [...] In the {{language}} of the Drúedain or Wild Men, it was gorgûn. In the Black Speech of Mordor, the equivalent was Uruk, {{as can be seen in}} Uruk-hai, [...] "Orc-folk". Orc itself is from Rohirric and the Hobbit-language, which shared linguistic roots, but the term is clearly related to the older Elvish words.|$|E
2500|$|In failing health, Lange {{retired from}} Parliament before the 1996 general election. In his valedictory speech, he {{reflected}} on the pain caused by his government's economic reforms: [...] "I want to thank those people whose lives were wrecked by us. They had been taught for years they {{had the right to}} an endless treadmill of prosperity and assurance, and we did them. People over 60 hate me. They hate me because I was the symbol of what caused that assurance of support and security to be shattered. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> has always been part of my burden."

He explains, [...] "when you're that age, you sometimes have a great burning enthusiasm that is very deep and very narrow, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> has always intrigued me - that world of the 11-year-old that is so quickly lost."

2500|$|The Washington Post {{film critic}} Stephen Hunter, a {{historian}} of the era, said: [...] "Any image of the American Revolution which represents you Brits as Nazis and us as gentle folk is almost certainly wrong. It was a very bitter war, a total war, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> I am afraid has been lost to history....he presence of the Loyalists (colonists {{who did not want}} to join the fight for independence from Britain) meant that the War of Independence was a conflict of complex loyalties." [...] The historian Richard F.

It could have kept us out of World War I." ...|$|E
2500|$|The milieu is {{identified}} by the author as science fantasy. As L'Engle explains in her book The Rock That Is Higher: Story as Truth: [...] "If we limit ourselves to the possible and provable... we render ourselves incapable of change and growth, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> should never end. If we limit ourselves to the age that we are, and forget all the ages that we have been, we diminish our truth." [...] Later in the same book, she further explains her use of the science fantasy genre: [...] "Writing A Wrinkle in Time... was my first effort in a genre now called 'science fantasy', and science fantasy is not far from fairy tale, that world which delves deep into the human psyche, struggling to find out {{at least a little}} more of what we are all about." ...|$|E

On the future of the band, Dan Searle wrote, [...] "We want to carry on, that is important to say, and we will strive to do so, but we will not release any music unless we truly believe that it is something that Tom would have been proud of.

2500|$|There {{are many}} {{perceptions}} on who Mohamed Bouazizi was. After his self-immolation, Bouazizi’s image flooded social media {{which lead to}} worldwide discourse. This complicated how Bouazizi was seen, [...] "Mohamed Bouazizi is not our hero. He's your hero," [...] said local Tunisian Arabic Nader Ncibi. There are accusations that social media diluted what Bouazizi stood for. Naafil Harshani, an activist that grew up with Bouazizi, said, [...] "what was important to Mohamed was putting {{food on the table}} and football. He {{had nothing to do with}} politics and wanted nothing to do with politics." [...] Mohamed Bouazizi did not plan to start a revolution, but it is undeniable that it preceded his anger towards not being able to sell his fruit. [...] "There are many stories on who Mohamed was and who Mohamed wasn't," [...] said Zahra Shwabli, a Hay Al Noor primary school teacher, [...] "It is important for us on this day to remember what Mohamed Bouazizi stood for: the dignity of all Tunisians.

2500|$|At the {{previous}} race in Italy, {{the gap between}} Rosberg and Hamilton had closed by seven points. Hamilton had started from pole position ahead of Rosberg, but had a poor start off the line and fell to fourth. He retook the lead after Rosberg braked late and went straight on at the first turn and used the escape road to rejoin the track. Hamilton remained the lead {{for the rest of}} the race to win. With six races left in the season, Hamilton was aware he could not lose any further ground to Rosberg in the championship battle and was pleased to make an improvement after his Monza victory: [...] "Despite the highs and lows, I'm still well and truly in the hunt for the championship and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> gives me huge motivation for the final six races - starting in Singapore." [...] Rosberg admitted Hamilton's form and past experience in championship battles could possibly be advantageous but it was something the latter was not concerned over and would focus on himself: [...] "At the moment, I am enjoying the moment more than I ever have in the sport because I get to a race and I have a car where I know I can be on pole and I can win," [...] Ricciardo stated that while he was aware his chances of winning the championship were not realistic, he would take a race-by-race approach, and hoped to win either of the season's next two races to draw closer in the title battle: [...] "All it takes is a couple of wins and a couple of bad races for the championship leader, and all of a sudden everything's possible again. So let's see what happens." ...|$|E
