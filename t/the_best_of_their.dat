5|$|It is {{very obvious}} to me that you must remove Sir George Prevost. I see he has gone to war about trifles with the general {{officers}} I sent him, which are certainly <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> rank in the army; and his subsequent failure and distresses will be aggravated by that circumstance; and will probably with the usual fairness of the public be attributed to it.|$|E

The government of Egypt formed the Royal Agricultural Society (RAS) in 1908, which is known today as the Egyptian Agricultural Organization (EAO).|$|E
5|$|Alive or Just Breathing is {{the second}} studio album by American metalcore band Killswitch Engage. It was {{released}} on May 21, 2002, through Roadrunner Records. Alive or Just Breathing was Killswitch Engage's first album on Roadrunner and was recorded from October 2001 to February 2002. Produced by drummer and guitarist Adam Dutkiewicz, this was the band's first album on a major label, which prompted them to write and record the album to <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> abilities. Alive or Just Breathing has been viewed as a landmark album in the metalcore genre and was well praised upon its release by fans and critics. The lyrics, which were all written by vocalist Jesse Leach, were intended to bring a positive message through the music.|$|E

5|$|Companions {{would have}} {{followed}} commands to <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> ability, but {{in accordance with}} their personality; for example, a berserker-type companion told to attack aggressively would charge into melee combat, while an assassin-type companion would attempt to hide, and then creep about knocking foes unconscious or backstabbing. In contrast, a priestess-type companion might support the player character by casting beneficial spells, while a paladin-type would give support by attacking the player character's target, and then healing the protagonist after the battle or if he or she came close to dying.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, {{the band}} re-recorded <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> early material, and {{released}} it as a compilation titled Days of Purgatory. Released in 1998, Something Wicked This Way Comes reached number19 on the German Media Control Charts. They {{followed up with}} the live album Alive in Athens(1999). In 2001, the band released their sixth full-length Horror Show—which reached the top 30 on the Austrian Ö3 Top 40 and German charts—and later that year, the five-disc box set Dark Genesis, which contained remastered versions of their first three studio albums, the demo Enter the Realm, and a studio album only of cover versions, titled Tribute to the Gods. The latter disc was released separately in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Leopoldii hybrids {{arose from}} the work of the British {{explorer}} and botanist Richard Pearce, an employee of James Veitch & Sons, a plant nursery. Pearce brought back specimens of Hippeastrum leopoldii and Hippeastrum pardinum from the Andes. These two species were notable for large flowers that were wide open and relatively symmetrical. Crossing these two species with the best of the Reginae strain produced a lineage of very large open flowered specimens, with up to 4-6 flowers on each scape. The Veitch nursery dominated the commercial development of Hippeastrum leopoldii and other varieties up to {{the early years of the}} twentieth century, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> hybrids setting the standard for modern commercial development.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, {{the band}} {{released}} <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> early material as a compilation titled Crawl File, which peaked at numbertwo on the albums charts. Geffen released Semantics, internationally, {{as a long}} play album with six newly re-recorded tracks compiled from their first three studio albums. Promotion of the album and the subsequent tour was stalled when Guy McDonough died in June of viral pneumonia. Before Guy's death, he had recorded demos with his brother Bill McDonough, and ex-members of their earlier band, The Flatheads. Bill McDonough assembled the tapes and produced Guy McDonough's posthumous album My Place on Wheatley Records in April 1985. Tracks from these sessions were re-mastered and released on Lost & Found in 1996, credited under the 'Members of Australian Crawl' name. Meanwhile, remaining Australian Crawl members had recorded their fourth studio album, Between a Rock and a Hard Place, which was released in 1985 and achieved number11 on the albums charts. This {{was followed by the}} announcement that they would disband after another tour. The live album, The Final Wave recorded their performance on 27 January 1986; it was released in October and peaked at number16 on the albums charts.|$|E
5|$|The Mail coach service began {{towards the}} end of the 18th century, adding to the {{existing}} use of fast coaches. The horses required for fast coaches were mainly produced by outcrossing heavy farm mares to the lighter racing type of horse, as a combination of speed, agility, endurance and strength was required. While the aristocracy and gentry paid high prices for matched teams of quality horses, farmers sold <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> animals at a good profit, keeping lower-quality animals for themselves, or for sale as saddle horses. The coaching trade grew from the trade in carriage of goods; some public transport was provided by farmers, who could keep large numbers of horses on their own farms more cheaply than those who had to buy in food and forage. However, proprietors of coaching inns accounted for most of the trade. In many cases a proprietor would work his horse teams only in his local district, but some owned many coaching establishments, and could provide transport over much greater distances. An advantage to proprietors of a string of coaching inns was that passengers on their coaches also used and paid for the services offered by their inns, often including overnight accommodation. Some inn proprietors owned hundreds of horses.|$|E

25|$|In the 19th century, {{hundreds}} of tourists visited Shaker villages, {{and many of}} them later wrote about their experiences there.

25|$|All {{military}} occupations {{were open}} to women in 1989, {{with the exception of}} submarine service, which opened in 2000.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a new {{algorithm}} for particle swarm optimisation (PSO) is proposed. In this algorithm, {{the particles}} {{are divided into}} two groups. The two groups have different focuses when all the particles are searching the problem space. The first group of particles will search the area around <b>the</b> <b>best</b> experience <b>of</b> <b>their</b> neighbours. <b>The</b> particles in the second group are influenced by <b>the</b> <b>best</b> experience <b>of</b> <b>their</b> neighbors and <b>the</b> individual <b>best</b> experience, {{which is the same}} as the standard PSO. Simulation results and comparisons with the standard PSO 2007 demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively enhances searching efficiency and improves the quality of searching.

25|$|Treatment {{initially}} {{is typically}} with pain medications. It is generally recommended that people continue with activities to <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> abilities. Often {{all that is}} required is time: in about 90% of people the problem goes away in less than six weeks. If the pain is severe and lasts {{for more than six}} weeks then surgery may be an option. While surgery often speeds pain improvement, long term benefits are unclear. Surgery may be required if complications occur such as bowel or bladder problems. Many treatments, including steroids, gabapentin, acupuncture, heat or ice, and spinal manipulation, have poor evidence for their use.|$|E
25|$|To help Tyler Thigpen {{prepare for}} the game against the Jets, the Chiefs {{implemented}} the spread offense to help Thigpen {{and the rest of}} the younger players play to <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> abilities, and also following the absence of RB Larry Johnson due to suspension. The Chiefs made a huge gamble by doing so, as most in the NFL believe that a spread offense cannot work in professional football, and also head coach Herman Edwards was traditionally in favor of more conservative, run-oriented game plans. Prior to the Chiefs implementing the spread offense, Thigpen had been playing erratically with the Chiefs, and he suddenly became poised and effective running the new offense.|$|E
