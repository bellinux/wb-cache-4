6000|$|A {{somewhat}} large {{experience in}} sorting finger prints {{in various ways}} and repeatedly, made it only too evident that the mental strain and risk of error caused by taking all slopes into account was considerable. The judgment became fatigued and the eye puzzled by having to assign opposite meanings to the same actual direction of a slope in {{the right and left}} hands respectively. There was also a frequent doubt as to the existence of a slope in large whorls of the spiral- and circlet-in-loop patterns (Fig. 13, ~21~, ~22~) when the impressions had not been rolled. A third objection is the rarity of the inner slopes in any other digit than the fore-finger. It acted like a soporific to the judgment not only of myself but of others, so that when an inner slope did occur it was apt to be overlooked. The first idea was to discard slopes altogether, notwithstanding the accompanying loss of index power, but this would be an unnecessarily trenchant measure. The slope of a loop, though it be on the fore-finger alone, decidedly merits recognition, for it differentiates such loops into two not very unequal classes. Again, there is little chance of mistake in noting it, the impression of the thumb on the one side and those of the remaining fingers on the other, affording easy guidance to the eye and judgment. These considerations determined the method I now use exclusively, by which Table IX. was compiled, and to which the second column of <b>Table</b> <b>X.,</b> headed [...] "i and o in fore-fingers," [...] refers.|$|E

5000|$|The last {{hatching}} {{method was}} developed by Charles Segoing, a French heraldist and royal historian in 1654 (Armorial universel, contenant les armes des principales maisons de l'Europe. Paris, 1654). His system {{is similar to the}} method of Petra Sancta. On the <b>table</b> <b>X</b> of his work, Otto Titan von Hefner published still another system of hatching from 1639, attributed to Lobkowitz. (On page 49, footnote 4 Hefner names his source as Rietstap's Handboek der Wapenkunde, p. 96.) His book titled Philippus Prudens contains as many as 27 engraved portraits of the Portuguese kings, among them several with hatched coat of arms, but there is no hatching table at all. However, in his earlier book from 1636 we can really find a hatching table. (One of the book censors was Christophe Butkens.) ...|$|E
50|$|Out {{of these}} systems, Otto Titan von Hefner {{published}} some further hatching methods at <b>table</b> <b>X</b> of his above cited book, presenting hatching methods for some additional tinctures as well. Some additional tinctures already {{appeared in the}} theory of heraldry in the early 15th century, which were then soon applied in practice. The German jurist and heraldist Eucharius Gottlieb Rink (1670-1746) introduced hatching for the gray (Eisen = iron) and proper (Naturfarbe). These hatchings (natürlichen Farbe, Eisenfarbe) were presented by Gatterer as well. He maintained that the first one is needless, but the second one has its own importance, because he had noticed himself that old armorials produced by herolds, at least in Germany, also made difference between iron-colour (Eisenfarbe) and the white colour (weisse Farbe), when they omit the term Argent. He also recommended to study the work by Johann David Köhler titled Programma de auctoribus incisurarum, to learn about the origin of hatchings. The German heraldist Christian Samuel Theodor Bernd (1775-1854) introduced hatching for some other tinctures such as Umbra (sienne, earth-color), Rotgelb (yellow-red, orange), Stahlblau (steel blue) and Blutfarbe (sanguine).|$|E

Also reported are estimated parameters from single-mechanism subsets of the data (Up, Down, and binary choice), analyzed in Section 4. 7. However, for this latter analysis, some subjects were dropped from the estimation because {{in at least one}} of the BDM treatments the dropped subject always chose a value at the ends of the distribution. (This happened for three of the sixty subjects, as noted in <b>Table</b> <b>X.)</b> These tted parameters were also used to calculate probability mass functions for the frequency of dierent types of reversals and chained dominance violations across all subjects. From these calculations, we report the respective expected frequency of reversals and chained dominance violations in Tables III and IV, as well as the respective equal-tail p-values in Tables XI and XII. 25 For the sake of comparison with the broader literature, we also report estimates of standard deviation (i) and CRRA risk aversion (i) parame-ters for each subject using an untruncated Fechner model of homoscedastic random errors (Becker, Degroot, and Marschak, 1963) in <b>Table</b> <b>X.</b> These 25 In Tables XI and XII, the null hypothesis is that the joint Blavatskyy model esti-mates reported in <b>Table</b> <b>X</b> are the population values (i. e. 1 = 0 : 71 and 1 = 0 : 29 for Subject 1, 2 = 0 : 86 and 2 = 0 : 30 for Subject 2, and so on).

40|$|It {{has been}} {{confirmed}} in previous researches in this laboratory that beta-quartz is piezoelectric. This property suggests the feasibility of measuring the dynamic elastic constants for this substance utilizing the piezoelectric effect {{as a means for}} setting up vibrations. A method of measuring frequencies of vibration for parallelopipeds of beta-quarts is described. The technique involves driving the plates with a frequency modulated carrier and detecting beat notes which are amplified and placed on an oscilloscope screen for ease of observation. High order harmonics of the resonances are measured under conditions which permit the plates to be treated as having essentially infinite lateral dimensions. Characteristic values are computed and sufficient number of determinantal equations derived to completely resolve the five elastic constants for beta-quartz as a simultaneous solution. The values of these constants are listed in <b>Table</b> <b>X</b> which also contains all the known results of other experimenters for comparison...|$|E
