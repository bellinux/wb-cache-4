5|$|In retrospect, {{being sent}} {{far from the}} Middle East (Egypt) he viewed as a parental {{decision}} much influenced by “the prospects of deracinated people, like us the Palestinians, being so uncertain {{that it would be}} best <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>me</b> as far away as possible.” The realities of peripatetic life—of interwoven cultures, of feeling out of place, and of homesickness—so affected the schoolboy Edward that themes of dissonance feature in the work and worldview of the academic Said. At school’s end, he had become Edward W. Said—a polyglot intellectual (fluent in English, French, and Arabic) who had earned a Bachelor of Arts (1957) degree at Princeton University, and Master of Arts (1960) and Doctor of Philosophy (1964) degrees in English Literature from Harvard University.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 Donnelly was a cosponsor of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIP). Appropriating over $60 {{billion over}} 5 years by {{matching}} {{federal funds to}} states that provide health insurance to children and pregnant women, and raising the federal cigarette tax from 39 cents to $1. After CHIP passed the House and the Senate, President George W. Bush vetoed the bill over a $30 billion spending difference between what he and congress proposed, saying that “Because the Congress has chosen <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>me</b> a bill that moves {{our health care system}} in the wrong direction, I must veto it,” and that lawmakers should “produce a good bill that puts poorer children first.” After Bush's decision on CHIP, Donnelly joined 217 Democrats and 42 Republicans in a failed measure to override Bush's veto. In 2009 after Bush left office, the House passed a new version of CHIP, and President Barack Obama signed it into law. The new version including the original expansion of coverage to 4 million children, and along with raising taxes on cigarettes, a new provision was added to raise taxes on other tobacco products.|$|E

Although he was in prison, Charles Burney purchased the [...] "Rules" [...] (allowing him some freedom), and Smart's final weeks may have been peaceful although pathetic. In his final letter, Smart begged for money from Rev.

500|$|In 1913, Chabas {{stated that}} he was [...] "pained and humiliated" [...] by the {{controversy}} over September Morn, though he later expressed more positive views. He described the work as [...] "all I know of painting", and responded positively to statements {{that it was his}} masterpiece. In a 1914 interview, he explained that he had not meant to sell the painting, as it [...] "was [...] wife's favorite picture". At {{the time of his death}} in 1937, Chabas had only a single picture in his room: a reproduction of the painting, completed from memory; he had boasted [...] "If I had never seen it from the day I put down my brushes after painting it, I could make a perfect copy." [...] However, not having copyrighted the work, he did not receive any royalties from the marketing frenzy in the United States; he recalled, [...] "Nobody was thoughtful enough even <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>me</b> a box of cigars." ...|$|E

I wrote the music and lyrics at the same time, and when that happens it's really magical to me." [...] After completing [...] "Objection (Tango)", Shakira decided to write ten more songs and began setting up portable recording studios in the rural region of Uruguay. She wrote various songs with a [...] "dictionary {{in one hand and a}} thesaurus in the other." [...] During the songwriting process, Shakira wrote [...] "Underneath Your Clothes" [...] as a love song for de la Rúa.

500|$|American singer Gloria Estefan, {{whose husband}} Emilio Estefan was {{managing}} Shakira at that time, felt that Shakira {{had the potential}} to crossover into the mainstream pop industry. However, Shakira was initially hesitant to record songs in English as it was not her first language, so Estefan offered to translate [...] "Ojos Así" [...] into English in order to show her that [...] "it could translate well." [...] Shakira then began translating the song herself and showed it to Estefan, who responded [...] "Quite honestly, I can't do this better!." [...] As Shakira wanted to have full control over her recordings, she decided to learn English better to enable her to write her own songs. Wanting to [...] "find a way to express my ideas and my feelings, my day-to-day stories in English", Shakira bought rhyming dictionaries, started analysing the lyrics of songs by Bob Dylan, reading poetry and the work of authors like Leonard Cohen and Walt Whitman and took English lessons from a private tutor. [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] became the first song Shakira wrote in English and in an interview with Faze, she talked about the writing process of the song, saying [...] "I prayed and asked God <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>me</b> a good song today, and I remember I started writing the song [...] a couple of hours after.

2500|$|Suggestions were made, despite initial {{skepticism}} on {{the part}} of the composer, that Boito would be interested in creating a new libretto based upon the play.

[...] Although she is often competent, Louise Lugg has had occasional ridiculous moments like Zero, such as when Beetle recommended she get on Sarge's good side then [...] "nail him"; after Sarge has a better opinion of Louise she is then seen ready to assault Sarge with a baseball bat - having taken Beetle's slang literally.|$|E
