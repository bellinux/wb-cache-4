5|$|In August 1939, Mazurkiewicz was {{assigned}} to the Diversionary Operations (Grupa Operacyjnej Dywersji) of the Polish General Staff, which was involved in counter-intelligence against Nazi Germany particularly in the Free City of Danzig. After the German Invasion of Poland and the imminent collapse of Polish defenses in mid-September, following plans made before the outbreak of the war, he organized Tajna Organizacja Wojskowa (Secret Military Organization, TOW), an underground group dedicated to sabotaging and resisting the German occupation. He journeyed to Paris, where he met with General Władysław Sikorski, the Polish prime minister in exile, who officially sanctioned the formation of <b>TOW.</b> <b>In</b> Hungary, Mazurkiewicz subsequently organized a cell whose purpose was to serve as a transit point for soldiers and couriers traveling between occupied Poland and France. He returned to Poland in June 1940.|$|E
5|$|As 1989 wore on, Prost {{continually}} {{claimed his}} Honda V10s were not producing {{the same amount}} of power as those in Senna's car. It actually {{got to the point where}} Honda F1 boss Osamu Goto felt compelled to speak to the specialist British media on the matter. He claimed that Senna's foot-tapping style with the accelerator helped keep the RA109-E's revs up in the engine's mid-range where most of the power was, while Prost's smoother style dropped the engines into low revs where they had a pick-up problem. Apparently the talk was convincing until most of those present noticed Goto continually called them Ayrton and Prost respectively (per Japanese customs, addressing a person by their first name rather than the surname shows a much higher degree of familiarity and confidentiality). An example of Prost's claims came during the Mexican Grand Prix. Despite his car running less wing than Senna's which theoretically would give him greater top speed, Prost's McLaren was not able to pass Senna's on the long front straight even though he came of the final Peraltada Curve clearly faster than the Brazilian and also had the benefit of a <b>tow.</b> <b>In</b> stark contrast, late in the race when Senna was lapping Prost (who was on fresh tyres), Senna was easily able to power past Prost on the straight.|$|E

25|$|England {{kept the}} same squad that faced Bangladesh ahead of the Test series against India. England {{performed}} well in the first Test, falling four wickets short of winning the game have played well with the bat. Four players, Alistair Cook, Joe Root, Ben Stokes and Moeen Ali scored centuries for England in the match. However, they were beaten soundly by 246 in the second game, despite James Anderson and Stuart Broad chipping in with wickets. Due to the poor form of both Ben Duckett and Gary Balance, Jos Buttler played in the third Test as the only other reserve batsman in the squad. England again struggled, having been dismissed for 283 in the first innings before India scored 417. Haseeb Hameed batted well for England in their second innings, although India chased down their small target <b>tow</b> <b>in</b> by eight wickets. Following the game, Hameed was ruled out {{for the rest of}} the series through injury along with Zafar Ansari. This resulted in Keaton Jennings and Liam Dawson being called up to the squad. Jennings scored a century on his debut in the next Test, but England’s bowlers again struggled, with India scoring 631 to win the match by an innings and 36 runs. In the final Test, England posted 477 in their first innings, but India again dominated with the bat, scoring 759/7. England collapsed on the final day, and India won by an innings and 75 runs to win the series 4–0.|$|E

The ship was placed back in reserve in 1886 and became flagship of the Reserve Squadron on 8 September 1892, which, despite its name, consisted of ships in commission. The squadron conducted exercises from June to August 1892 in French waters. Richelieu was condemned on 5 March 1900, but was not immediately sold. After having been sold to Dutch ship breakers, Richelieu departed Toulon on 28 January 1911. She was under <b>tow</b> <b>in</b> the Bay of Biscay, having left the Mediterranean {{for the first time in}} her existence, when a storm caused the tugboat to cast her loose.
