25|$|As {{the oldest}} and largest human {{intervention}} in nature, {{the environmental impact of}} agriculture in general and more recently intensive agriculture, industrial development, and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields. These include <b>technological</b> <b>fields</b> that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology, such as integrated pest management, waste treatment technologies, landscape architecture, genomics, and agricultural philosophy fields that include references to food production as something essentially different from non-essential economic 'goods'. In fact, the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science.|$|E

2500|$|Revered in {{her later}} {{years as a}} heroine of the feminist movement, Luce had mixed {{feelings}} {{about the role of}} women in society. As a Congresswoman in 1943, she was invited to co-sponsor a submission of the Equal Rights Amendment, offered by Representative Louis Ludlow of Indiana, but claimed that the invitation got lost in her mail. Luce never ceased to advise women to marry and provide supportive homes for their husbands. (During her ambassadorial years, at a dinner in Luxembourg attended by many European dignitaries, Luce was heard declaiming that all women wanted from men was [...] "babies and security.") Yet, her own professional career as a successful editor, writer, playwright, reporter, legislator, and diplomat remarkably showed how a woman of humble origins and no college education could raise herself to an escalating series of public heights. Luce bequeathed a large part of her personal fortune of some $50 million to an academic program, the Clare Boothe Luce Program, designed to encourage the entry of women into <b>technological</b> <b>fields</b> traditionally dominated by men. Because of her determination and unwillingness to let her gender stand in the way of her personal and professional achievements, Luce is considered to be an influential role model by many women. Starting from humble beginnings, Luce never allowed her initial poverty or her male counterparts' lack of respect to keep her from achieving as much if not more than many of the men surrounding her. In 2017, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.|$|E

I study internal changes to the technology as it is adopted by diverse institutional actors—across different scientific communities and national boundaries, and from academic to the business sector. External transformations are examined by analyzing the relationship between developments in related technological domains with path setting of the studied field. Grid computing—a largely open <b>technological</b> <b>field,</b> key to the Cyberinfrastructure and eScience paradigm and {{to some of the}} largest scientific collaborations to date—is used as a case study. Multiple methods including participant observations, interviews, content analysis and examination of a dynamic participation network over time, are used to investigate the impact of different levels of socio-technical dynamics on the studied technology...|$|R
