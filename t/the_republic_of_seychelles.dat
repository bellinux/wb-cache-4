25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Seychelles</b> {{achieved}} independence on 29 June 1976. James Mancham {{was president}} and France-Albert René was prime minister, but {{relations between the}} two quickly soured. In 1977 René's leftist supporters launched an armed coup while Mancham was in London. Though René denied any responsibility, he assumed the presidency in June. Two plots were formulated the following year to depose him, but they failed. In 1979 his party won an election and he pursued a socialist agenda, upsetting the small but influential middle class population. His reign also saw the withdrawal of South Africa's landing rights as well as a deterioration of economic ties between the two countries. René frequently warned that sympathizers of the old government were conspiring to use mercenaries to stage a counter-coup. Most of his critics dismissed the alleged plots as exaggerated or even fabricated excuses to jail political opponents.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: There are six African {{small island}} {{developing}} states: the Union <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Comoros; <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> Guinea‐Bissau; <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> Cabo Verde; <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> Mauritius; <b>the</b> <b>Seychelles</b> and <b>the</b> Democratic <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> São Tomé and Príncipe. Apart from Mauritius, {{the other five}} states are relatively new to democracy with several of these states only transitioning from one party states to multi‐party states in the early 1990 s. International and domestic observers declared the last round of elections in all ASIDS free and fair, but this reveals little {{of the quality of}} elections in these small island developing states. All six states are members of the African Union (AU) and are therefore obliged to adhere to its election principles. Therefore, this article examines the quality of elections in the ASIDS by analysing {{the extent to which they}} are free and fair using the principles of the AU’s Declaration on the Principles Governing Democratic Elections in Africa. Findings reveal that despite continued logistical and other problems that persist, the election process is generally well managed and violence relatively minimal, a remarkable achievement given the volatile political histories in all save one of these small island states. Challenges appear to centre on continued inter‐institutional instability in some cases, failure to adhere to constitutional amendments in others, some instances of continued harassment and a lack of financial and technical resources, all of which have to some extent impacted electoral qualit...|$|R
