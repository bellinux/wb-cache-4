5|$|Basil II's {{first attempt}} to {{overwhelm}} the defenders of the pass was unsuccessful and his army was unable {{to pass through the}} valley, which was defended by 15,000–20,000 Bulgarians. Despite the difficulties the Byzantine Emperor did not abandon the attack. He ordered his general Nicephorus Xiphias to manoeuvre his troops around the high Belasitsa mountain and surround the Bulgarians, while he continued the assaults on the wall. Xiphias led his troops along a steep path that led him into the Bulgarians' rear. On July 29, Xiphias attacked the guards, trapping them in the valley. The Bulgarian soldiers abandoned their towers <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>this</b> new threat and Basil was able to break through the front line and destroy the wall.|$|E
5|$|More acute {{threat to}} the Polish–Lithuanian state came from Sweden. The {{balance of power in}} the north had shifted in Sweden's favor, as the Baltic {{neighbor}} was led by King Gustavus Adolphus, a highly able and aggressive military leader, who greatly improved the effectiveness of the Swedish armed forces, while also taking advantage of Protestant zealotry. The Commonwealth, exhausted by the wars with Russia and the Ottoman Empire and lacking allies, was poorly prepared <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>this</b> new challenge. Continuous diplomatic maneuvering by Sigismund III made the whole situation look to szlachta like another stage in the King's Swedish dynastic affairs; in reality the Swedish power resolved to take hold of the entire Polish-controlled Baltic coast, and thereby profit from the Commonwealth's maritime trade intermediary control, endangering its basis for independent existence.|$|E
5|$|Samuel's {{decision}} to face Basil II and {{the bulk of}} his army at Kleidion was not only prompted by the constant defeats and invasions which had devastated the country, but also by concerns over his authority among the nobility, which had been fatally weakened by Basil's campaigns. In 1005 for example, the governor of the important Adriatic port of Dyrrhachium had surrendered the town to Basil II. <b>To</b> <b>face</b> <b>this</b> threat, Samuel gathered a large army to face the Byzantines, some claiming it numbered as many as 45,000 soldiers. Basil II also prepared carefully, assembling a large army of his own and taking his most experienced commanders, including the governor of Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv), Nicephorus Xiphias, who had conquered the old Bulgarian capitals Pliska and Preslav from Samuel in 1001.|$|E

25|$|On 6 May, a major Russian {{offensive}} toward Anatolia developed. The Ottoman defensivee lines {{consisted of}} the X and XI Corps and the 5th Expeditionary Force at the north flank located beyond the province of Van. The north flank of the Russian advance, from Tortum valley toward Erzurum, {{was not part of}} the operations in Van. However, as part of this Russian offensive, the Ottoman 1st Expeditionary Force and the Van Cavalry Brigade were pushed back from their initial positions by Russian soldiers and Armenian voluenteers advancing toward the city of Van. On 12 May, the town of Ardjish at the north of province of Van was relieved. Djevdet sent one cannon and two hundred men from the city of Van <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>this</b> group at the Bargiri (Muradiye). However, it was a late move and far too weak to stop this advance. On 6 May, the conflicts around the citadel of Van (in the Kale District) were over.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, 30,000 Allies under Suvorov {{moved up}} the north bank of the Po River toward Turin. On the morning of 26 May, Josef Philipp Vukassovich's advance guard seized Turin with its arsenal and over 300 cannons plus large stocks of ammunition. Pascal Antoine Fiorella and his 3,400-man French {{garrison}} withdrew to the citadel where they were besieged. Early June found the Allied main body of 47,087 troops under Suvorov, Rosenberg and Michael von Melas camped near Turin. Karl Joseph Hadik von Futak with 9,900 Austrians watched the Swiss mountain passes. Kray's 19,760-man corps was engaged in the Siege of Mantua, covered by 6,122 Austrians under Johann von Klenau at Ferrera. Finally, Suvorov summoned the 19,458-strong corps of Count Heinrich von Bellegarde from Switzerland to Milan where they arrived on 5 June. <b>To</b> <b>face</b> <b>this</b> array, Moreau counted about 25,000 soldiers in the divisions of Paul Grenier, Claude Victor-Perrin, Pierre Garnier de Laboissière at Genoa, Paul Louis Gaultier de Kervéguen at Florence and Joseph Hélie Désiré Perruquet de Montrichard at Bologna. But the Allies were aware that Jacques MacDonald had a strong French occupation force in southern and central Italy.|$|E

He would later describe the events: [...] He left Târgovişte on 2 October, and 9 by October he had reached Prejmer in southern Transylvania, where he met envoys {{from the city of}} Braşov.

500|$|In February 2006, Stork {{became the}} last {{perpetrator}} sentenced {{in the political}} assassination plot, after ten months of negotiations with Oregon prosecutors. Stork offered to turn herself in {{and return to the}} United States after learning of her son's terminal brain tumor. Prior to sentencing, the court allowed her to travel to Australia to visit her son. In addition to charges of conspiracy to commit murder, Stork also pleaded guilty to the purchase of weapons in violation of federal firearms law. An Oregon judge sentenced her to five years probation, and three months time already served in a German jail. Turner thought she should have received a harsher sentence, and commented [...] "This was a lying-in-wait conspiracy to murder me, a presidential appointee, {{and for a long time}} I slept with a loaded gun beside my bed." [...] Though Stork could have faced life in prison, U.S. District Judge Judge Malcolm F. Marsh thought she had [...] "seen the error of her ways." [...] A federal prosecutor in the case described Stork as the [...] "MVP" [...] of the conspiracy, and said she was the designated assassin that was set to murder Turner. After her sentencing, Stork stated: [...] "I actually conspired to kill Mr. Turner, it is up to me alone <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>this</b> terrible truth ... No person has the right to do what I did. I'm truly sorry." [...] Stork returned to Germany after her sentencing.|$|E
500|$|In addition, Tessa {{shares with}} MacLeod the {{consequences}} of his involvement in the Game. She dislikes the Game and would like to escape from it with him, since she fears for his life. According to Vandernoot, Tessa [...] "...always thought that she [...] die before [...] ", but when he told her about the Game during [...] "The Gathering", [...] "she [...] that he [...] be killed", thus she avoided thinking about it. Another consequence of the Game is that Tessa is sometimes exposed to danger from Immortals who want to use her to pressure MacLeod. Despite being captured by Quince in [...] "The Gathering", by the time of [...] "Band of Brothers", she is able to face Grayson: [...] "If you think [...] will stand by, ...you have misjudged him terribly. So you'd better kill me, now, and be done with it." [...] Grayson releases her and calls her [...] "...a remarkable woman, well worth keeping alive." [...] Consequently, Tessa is fully aware of the risks of their relationship, but stays with MacLeod, explaining in [...] "Eyewitness" [...] that [...] "I know the risks I choose to take... I stay with you because I want to. I won't run. I'm not the little woman and I'll never be barefoot and pregnant. We all have things <b>to</b> <b>face.</b> <b>This</b> is mine."
