25|$|The transesophageal {{echocardiogram}} (TEE) is {{a relatively}} good test in the diagnosis of aortic dissection, with a sensitivity up to 98% and a specificity up to 97%.

It is especially good {{in the evaluation of}} AI in the setting of ascending aortic dissection, and to determine whether the ostia (origins) of the coronary arteries are involved. While many institutions give sedation during <b>transesophageal</b> <b>echocardiography</b> for added patient comfort, it can be performed in cooperative individuals without the use of sedation. Disadvantages of TEE include the inability to visualize the distal ascending aorta (the beginning of the aortic arch), and the descending abdominal aorta that lies below the stomach.

For unexplained DCS (DCS without commission of any diving procedural errors), this difference was significant for large PFOs only.

40|$|AbstractObjective. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to verify the usefulness of transesophageal Doppler recording of blood flow velocity in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery, after a peripheral injection of a lung-crossing contrast agent (SHU 508 A), in detecting and locating a hemodynamically significant stenosis (vessel narrowing ≥ 50 %) affecting this portion of the vessel. Background. <b>Transesophageal</b> Doppler <b>echocardiography</b> has a limited diagnostic impact on the evaluation of proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenoses. Peripheral injection of SHU 508 A, a lung-crossing contrast agent enhancing Doppler signal to noise ratio in coronary arteries, may allow recording of localized disturbed blood flow velocity at the stenosis site {{even in the absence of}} a clear B-mode visualization of the vessel. Methods. <b>Transesophageal</b> Doppler <b>echocardiography,</b> before and after echo contrast injection, was performed in 31 patients who underwent coronary angiography. Using color Doppler as a guide, pulsed wave Doppler recording of blood flow velocity in the left anterior descending coronary artery was attempted to detect a localized increase in blood flow velocity. B-mode evaluation of the vessel was also performed. Results. Angiography showed a significant proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis in 16 patients (group 1) and no stenosis in 15 patients (group 2). In 15 of 16 group 1 patients, Doppler after contrast injection revealed a localized velocity increase of at least 50 % of the reference value; mean (±SD) percent increase in velocity was 150 ± 89 % (range 367 % to 0 %). In group 2 Doppler after contrast injection revealed a mild localized increase in velocity in four patients and no increase in velocity in the remaining 11 patients; mean (±SD) percent increase in velocity was 5 ± 7 % (range 21 % to 0 %, p < 0. 001 vs. percent increase in group 1). When a percent velocity increase ≥ 50 % of the reference value was considered a positive criterion for detecting significant stenosis, the sensitivity and specificity were 92 % and 100 %, respectively. The sensitivity of the evaluation before contrast injection or considering B-mode imaging alone was much lower (25 % and 19 %, respectively, p < 0. 001 vs. evaluation after contrast injection). In addition, color Doppler after contrast injection correctly located the stenosis along the vessel, as compared with angiography. Conclusions. Blood flow evaluation of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery by <b>transesophageal</b> Doppler <b>echocardiography</b> after contrast injection is a feasible and reliable method for detecting and locating significant stenoses affecting this part of the vessel and is an improvement over the traditional ultrasound approach...|$|R

BackgroundPLAATO is a device designed to seal the neck of the left atrial (LA) appendage and reduce embolization in patients with atrial fibrillation intolerant of warfarin. The impact of deployment of this device on adjacent structures has not been reported. MethodsPatients with atrial fibrillation participating in the ongoing study for evaluation of PLAATO were enrolled. <b>Transesophageal</b> <b>echocardiographies</b> at baseline, one, and six months were reviewed to measure LA and LUPV dimensions, degree of mitral regurgitation, stability of the device, peak MV E-wave velocity, and peak systolic and diastolic flow velocities in the LUPV. Data were analyzed by a linear mixed model for repeated measures. ResultsEleven patients (mean age of 72 ± 7 years) completed six months of follow-up. Left upper pulmonary vein diameter (mean: 1. 55, 1. 61, 1. 54 cm, p = 0. 13) and peak systolic (mean: 0. 38, 0. 34, 0. 31 m/s, p = 0. 72) and diastolic flow velocities (mean: 0. 39, 0. 40, 0. 42 m/s, p = 0. 46) did not differ over the follow-up period. Left atrial size, mitral regurgitation severity, and MV peak E-wave velocities (mean: 0. 94, 0. 94, 0. 82 m/s, p = 0. 58) showed no significant change from baseline.

40|$|AbstractDetection of patent foramen ovale by {{contrast}} echocardiography {{is based on}} transient inversion (right atrial pressure higher than left atrial pressure) of the interatrial pressure gradient. Therefore, the presence of left-sided heart disease with potential elevation of left atrial pressure might obscure the diagnosis of patent foramen ovale. Accordingly, 150 patients (88 men, 62 women; mean age 51. 7 ± 15. 2 years) were evaluated for a patent foramen ovale by <b>transesophageal</b> contrast <b>echocardiography.</b> Additionally, atrial septal motion during normal respiration and during the Valsalva maneuver was analyzed. Patency of the foramen ovale was observed in 20 (27 %) of 74 patients without left-sided heart disease and with previous arterial embolism, in none (0 %) of 25 patients with left-sided heart disease and embolism, in 7 (39 %) of 18 patients without left-sided heart disease and without embolism and in 3 (9 %) of 33 patients with left-sided heart disease and without embolism. The detection rate of patent foramen ovale was lower in patients with than without left-sided heart disease (5 % vs. 29 %, p = 0. 0007) but was similar in patients with and without embolism (20 % vs. 19. 5 %, p = NS). Abnormal atrial septal motion was more frequently observed in patients with left-sided heart disease (p = 0. 0003) and was inversely correlated to detection of patent foramen ovale (p = 0. 0003). Multivariate analysis revealed an independent association between the absence of left-sided heart disease and the detection of patent foramen ovale (p = 0. 0003). These data suggest that in patients with left-sided heart disease, patency of the foramen ovale may be missed even by <b>transesophageal</b> contrast <b>echocardiography...</b>|$|R
