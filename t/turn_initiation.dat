While many cues to turn change have been proposed, especially in multi-modal frameworks, here {{we focus on}} the use of prosodic cues to these functions. In particular, we consider the use of prosodic cues in a tone language, Mandarin Chinese, where variations in pitch height and slope additionally serve to determine word meaning. Within a corpus of spontaneous Chinese dialogues, we find that turn-unit final syllables are significantly lower in average pitch and intensity than turnunit initial syllables in both smooth turn changes and segments ended by speaker overlap. Interruptions are characterized by significant prosodic differences from smooth <b>turn</b> <b>initiations.</b> Furthermore, we demonstrate that these contrasts correspond to an overall lowering across all tones in final position, which largely preserves the relative heights of the lexical tones. In classification tasks, we contrast the use of text and prosodic features. Finally, we demonstrate that, on balanced training and test sets, we can distinguish turnunit final words from other words at ≈ 93 % accuracy and interruptions from smooth <b>turn</b> unit <b>initiations</b> at 62 % accuracy...|$|R

The wind model required for the optimization algorithm to work may utilize onboard wind estimates only, incorporate the ground winds provided a priori or on-line by the target ground station, or be based on the winds measured and uplinked by the preceding system. The previous work by the authors took care of the major touchdown error contributor, downwind variation of the winds. The effect of these variations was mitigated by constantly recomputing an optimal reference trajectory to complete a final turn in a given time. This paper presents some modifications of the original optimization routine to accommodate some specific applications including intentional landing with a substantial crosswind component and operating in the mountainous areas with significant variations in the vertical component of the wind (updrafts and downdrafts). Specifically, the paper presents derivation of equations to account for one-, two- and three-dimensional structure of the wind. In addition, adjustments to the optimal control problem using the direct-method-based approach developed earlier for a simple one-dimensional wind model are developed.

40|$|In general, {{scientific}} sources distinguish two mechanisms {{leading to}} knock: self-ignition and detonation [13, 24, 28]. Theory of self-ig-nition assumes spontaneous initiation of combustion {{in the part}} of the combustion chamber which lies usually in the most distant location from the spark-plug. Self-ignition zone is defined as end-gas region containing unburned charge. When temperature and charge pressure reach boundary conditions, a spontaneous self-ignition takes place in one or more points simultaneously. A very violent explosion follows, resulting in pressure waves, which oscillating, create typical sound effects. Theory of detonation in <b>turn</b> assumes <b>initiation</b> of knocking as a result of flame front propagation, which accelerates with supersonic speed from the spark-plug towards surrounding end-gas and peripher-ies of the combustion chamber. This creates shock wave (detonation), which reflects from the combustion chamber walls with its resonant frequency.

Fourteen non-experts and five expert slalom skiers completed an alpine slalom course in an indoor ski slope while wearing a head-mounted eye tracking device. Experts completed the slalom clearly faster than non-experts, but no significant difference was found in timing and position of the <b>turn</b> <b>initiation.</b> Although both groups already looked at future obstacles approximately 0, 5 s before passing the upcoming pole, the higher speed of experts implied that they shifted gaze spatially earlier in the bend than non-experts. Furthermore, experts focussed more on the second next pole while non-expert slalom skiers looked more to the snow surface immediately in front of their body. No difference was found in the fixation frequency, average fixation duration, and quiet eye duration between both groups. These results suggest that experts focus on the timing of their actions while non-experts still need to pay attention to the execution of these actions. These results also might suggest that ski trainers should instruct non-experts and experts to focus on the next pole and, shift their gaze to the second next pole shortly before reaching it. Based on the current study it seems unadvisable to instruct slalom skiers to look several poles ahead during the actual slalom.

40|$|Studies on {{interaction}} management {{point out the}} importance of eye gaze as a turn regulator. Speakers can, for example, use their gaze to initiate or yield the turn (e. g. Kendon 1967, Goodwin 1981). At {{the end of the}} current speakers’ turn, interlocutors tend to establish mutual gaze and the next speaker shifts his gaze away to signal <b>turn</b> <b>initiation.</b> More recently, Rossano (2012) claims that eye gaze does not function on the level of turn management, but rather on the level of sequence organization, i. e. interlocutors’ gaze behavior differs according to the sequential environment. Whereas speakers tend to gaze away during extended telling sequences, they maintain gazing at their addressee when asking a question (Rossano 2012). Conversation analytical research on signed interactions also indicates that eye gaze is used to negotiate speakership. Signers, as speakers, tend to withdraw gaze from their interlocutor when initiating a turn and gaze back at the addressee at brief moments during the turn- at- talk (e. g. Baker 1977 for American Sign Language, Van Herreweghe 2005 for Flemish Sign Language and Lackner 2009 for Austrian Sign Language). However, these studies focus on turn management in general and a more systematic approach to the role of eye gaze is desirable.

40|$|It is {{well-established}} that {{turning on}} the spot or changing the direction of walking involves a stereotyped sequence of eye, head and body segment rotation characterized by an anticipatory gaze strategy driven primarily by eye movements (nystagmus). However, the relationship between eye movements and whole-body coordination during turning has not been fully explored under different environmental and sensory contexts and as a result, the neural mechanisms responsible for this coordination are poorly understood. The first aim of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} effects of turn size and speed on eye movements and intersegmental coordination. Results showed systematic relationships between turn speed, amplitude and eye and whole-body coordination characteristics and that the timing of eye, head and axial segment reorientation onset does not accurately represent coordination during the turn. Secondly, we investigated the effects of either removing vision or suppressing eye movements during turns. We found that eye and motor behaviour during vision removal was similar to behaviour during full vision, however suppressing eye movements delayed gait initiation and decreased stepping frequency throughout the turn. Next we examined the influence of neck muscle vibration on turning and found that stimulating neck proprioceptors to evoke the CNS perception of head rotation with respect to the upper body resulted in early <b>turn</b> <b>initiation.</b> Lastly, we looked at the effects of divided attention using a secondary cognitive task during the turn. We found that turn onset was delayed during dual-tasking, but eye and body coordination were unaffected. We conclude that oculomotor nystagmus during turning represents a crucial component of an automatic, subcortically generated motor synergy, the release of which is dependent on cortical and sensory input (i. e. eye and neck proprioception).

Mean accuracy±precision was 1. 5 ± 6. 8. cm for stride length, 1. 4 ± 5. 6. cm/s for stride velocity, 1. 9 ± 2. 0. cm for foot clearance, and 1. 6 ± 6. 1 ° for turning angle.

40|$|Perhaps no {{frequent}} driving maneuver is more hazardous {{than the}} left turn. Existing statistical analyses {{indicate that the}} older drivers are over represented in the left turn configuration. It {{is not surprising that}} the left-turn proves such a hazardous configuration since the turning driver has minimal, obscured, and conflicting information upon which to base their turn decisions. In addition, understanding the problems of the left-turn presents a number of information and task decomposition challenges. For example, given a driver's expected vehicle response, prediction of other vehicles future positions relative to the driver's own position must be visually interpreted from available motion-in-depth information. Some have likened the task of the turning driver to one of coincident timing, where <b>turn</b> <b>initiation</b> and completion must be synchronized with acceptable gaps in on-coming traffic (2). Acceptability is predicated on each individual drivers perception of this traffic in terms of physical characteristics (3, 4). Objectively, vehicles can vary in terms of their relative approach velocities, the changing gap difference between themselves and the vehicle they follow, and their configuration in terms of size, shape, and color. If drivers use these physical variables singly, changes in turn strategies would logically be consistent with such physical parameters. If, however, drivers base their decisions on higher-order information sources like rate-of-expansion of the vehicle frontal surface (time-to-arrival), the pattern of results would not be consistent with manipulations of these physical properties. Previously, this proposition was tested for a college-age population in the University of Minnesota's fixed-based automobile simulator (5). This group of drivers, with a mean age of 24. 2, initiated left-turns, not on the basis of any physical metric, but through inference on time-to-arrival information. The present experiment examines the same driving maneuver in older drivers. We hypothesized that the turn strategies employed by older drivers would be, in part, mediated by these same higher-order information sources, but that the scaling of that information relative to their own self-perceived limitations would render them more conservative in a manner consistent with traditional performance speed assessment metrics such as visual search time and reaction time.

40|$|Background: Turning during {{locomotion}} involves considerable {{changes of}} the body's center of mass and reduced stability, as well as lower limb kinematics and kinetics. However, many previous studies {{have been carried out}} to evaluate the effectiveness and applications of orthotic insoles as well as different types of orthotic materials in various clinical symptoms, which are focused primarily on straight line walking. Hence, the influence of custom-made insoles with the use of advanced three-dimensional spacer fabrics on biomechanics parameters in terms of plantar pressure distribution and lower limb electromyography during turning movement was studied. Methods: Twelve subjects performed 180 -degree turning at a speed 3. 07 - 3. 74 km/h for five successful trials under 3 insoles conditions: wearing traditional ethylene vinyl acetate insoles and two different spacer-fabricated insoles, with the plantar pressure and lower limb muscle activity collected simultaneously. Turning movement was broken down into 3 phases for analysis: Turning initiation, turn around and turn termination. Results: There was a statistically significance difference in plantar pressure between the traditional insoles and the insoles made of a spacer fabric as the top layer (p 12 %) and pressure-time integral (> 13 %) in toes, metatarsal head 1 and metatarsal heads 2 - 3 at turning initiation; (> 15 %) and (> 17 %) in medial midfoot and medial heel at turn around. Insoles with spacer fabrics on the top and middle layer reduced both pressure parameters (> 18 %) in toes and MTH 1 at turn termination. In terms of muscle activities, insoles with two-layer spacer fabrics could lower maximum muscle activities of vastus lateralis (> 16 %; p< 0. 05) at turn around. Conclusions: Insoles with different fabrications could offer various pressure offloading patterns across the plantar and muscle activity changes while turning. Insoles with a spacer fabric on the top tend to reduce plantar pressure loading at different regions during <b>turn</b> <b>initiation</b> and turn around phases, while two-layer spacer-fabricated insoles may contribute to reduced vastus lateralis muscle activation during turn around. More importantly, this study provides a new dimension in the potential use of the textile-fabricated insoles which may widen the range of insole materials selection in the design and development of insoles so as to enhance the effectiveness of orthotic treatment.

40|$|Parkinsons disease (PD) {{is already}} {{characterized}} by turning {{difficulties in the}} early stages of the disease and turning is one of the most important triggers for freezing of gait (FOG). During these freezing-episodes, patients get the feeling that their feet are glued to the floor and they are not able to walk any further, increasing the risk to fall. Studies of turning in PD and the link with FOG are sparse. The aim of this doctoral project is to analyze turning problems in PD patients with and without FOG (freezers and non-freezers), to understand the changes in turning related to freezing-episodes and present a basis for potential rehabilitation strategies specific to turning in PD. This research project consisted of 2 separate gait analysis studies. During the first study subjects were asked to turn 0 °, 180 ° and 360 ° with and without a dual task, to investigate the most freezing-provoking situation and explore turning problems inherent to FOG. Despite equal disease severity, cadence was markedly increased in freezers during turning in contrast to non-freezers and controls who responded with a cadence decrement. When increasing task-complexity (i. e. 360 ° turning and dual-tasking), the chance of freezing was enhanced by 29. 5 %. Remarkably, cognitive profiles of freezers were more affected than non-freezers and the secondary task performance during turning showed more signs of deterioration. The spatiotemporal problems were more pronounced when patients turned to their disease dominant side, but this did not correlate with freezing prevalence. FOG was more frequently initiated at the inner side of the turning cycle (64. 9 %), i. e. at the leg which had to produce the smallest step length. Still, a significant proportion of episodes started at the outer side (35. 1 %). FOG episodes occurred most frequently at the end of a 180 ° turn. Besides the spatiotemporal problems of stepping, the axial rotation movements in freezers, non-freezers and controls were analysed to explore why patients freeze. The axial rotation was already impaired at the start of the turn, as freezers initiated the head rotation closer to the turning marker in comparison to non-freezers or controls, resulting in an increased coupling between head and pelvis. This problem was emphasized even more during freezing trials, when head and pelvis turned completely en-bloc. The axial deficits continued during the turn, resulting in a delayed start of the counter rotation in freezers. This counter rotation was necessary to stabilize the head on the pelvis to re-initiate normal walking. Therefore freezers had insufficient time to prepare the end of the turn, which may explain the increased FOG-episodes near the end. These axial differences were independent of disease severity and only slightly explainable by turn velocity differences between groups. In the second part of this doctoral thesis, it was investigated how various rehabilitation strategies would influence freezing and its associated spatiotemporal and axial movement characteristics. For this aim we studied the effects of unilateral rhythmical cueing (i. e. cueing each stride on the left or right side instead of each separate step) at a frequency of 90 % of their preferred stride frequency to slow down cadence during the turn and as such prevent FOG. We studied unilateral cueing in order to ascertain whether it mattered to distinguish between turning sides. We found that unilateral cueing was successful in correcting the spatiotemporal abnormalities but not in preventing the axial impairments that were related to FOG. On the contrary, en bloc turning was even more pronounced during cueing. FOG episodes were successfully reduced during cueing (92. 8 %), irrespective of cue-side but not when cues were subsequently withdrawn. In contrast, an attentional strategy which emphasized the rotation of the head at <b>turn</b> <b>initiation</b> normalized the en-bloc movement and ensured that the center of mass (COM) shifted more towards the inner side of the turn. Despite these corrections, FOG-trials were only reduced with 34. 5 %. This suggests that external generation of movement by means of cueing and preventing a cadence increase is more effective to reduce FOG than internally generated movements which correct en-bloc movement. The en-bloc movement of freezers might indicate a compensatory strategy for rotation problems. In summary, the above described insights into the spatiotemporal and axial movement differences between freezers, non-freezers and controls have shown how an asymmetrical gait task, such as turning, brings on motor challenges which are more difficult to withstand by freezers despite similar disease severity to their non-freezing counterparts. While these findings do not offer a clear explanation for FOG during turning yet, they provide a good basis for new hypotheses on why FOG is so common during this motor task. The fact that correcting the spatiotemporal problems with cueing reduced FOG while enhancing an en-bloc movement points to the possibility that this is a balance-saving strategy for freezers. nrpages: 187 status: publishe...|$|E

Transferrin and its receptor appear to be involved in an autocrine pathway which is functionally linked to the IL- 2 /IL- 2 receptor autocrine loop...|$|R
40|$|Clostridium botulinum C 2 toxin is {{a binary}} toxin {{composed}} of an enzymatic component (C 2 I) and a binding component (C 2 II). The activated binding component (C 2 IIa) forms heptamers, and the oligomer with C 2 I {{is taken up}} by receptor-mediated endocytosis. We investigated the binding and internalization of C 2 IIa in cells. The C 2 IIa monomer formed oligomers on lipid rafts in membranes of MDCK cells. Methyl-beta-cyclodextrin inhibited the binding of C 2 IIa and the rounding of the cells induced by C 2 I plus C 2 IIa. C 2 I was localized to the rafts in the presence, but not the absence, of C 2 IIa. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that C 2 I bound to the oligomer of C 2 IIa, but not the monomer of C 2 IIa. C 2 I and C 2 IIa were rapidly internalized in the cells. LY 294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) inhibitor, inhibited the internalization of C 2 IIa in the cells and the rounding activity {{in the presence of}} C 2 I plus C 2 IIa. Incubation of the cells with C 2 I plus C 2 IIa resulted in the activation of PI 3 K and in phosphorylation of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 and protein kinase B/Akt (Akt), but that with C 2 IIa alone did not. Akt inhibitor X, an Akt phosphorylation inhibitor, inhibited the rounding activity but not the internalization of C 2 IIa. The results suggest that the binding of C 2 I to the oligomer of C 2 IIa on rafts triggers the activation of the PI 3 K-Akt signaling pathway and, in <b>turn,</b> the <b>initiation</b> of endocytosis...|$|R
40|$|Background: Sipping or tasting {{alcohol is}} one of the {{earliest}} alcohol-use behaviors in which young children engage, yet there is relatively little research on this behavior. Previous cross-sectional analyses determined that child sipping or tasting is associated with the child’s attitude toward sipping and with a family environment supportive of alcohol use, but not with variables reflecting psychosocial proneness for problem behavior as formulated in Problem Behavior Theory (Jessor and Jessor, Problem Behavior and Psychosocial Development: A Longitudinal Study of Youth, 1977, Academic Press, New York). This study extended these analyses longitudinally to identify antecedent predictors of the childhood initia-tion of sipping or tasting alcohol in a multiwave study. Methods: A sample of 452 children (238 girls) aged 8 or 10 and their families was drawn from Alle-gheny County, PA, using targeted-age directory sampling and random digit dialing procedures. Chil-dren were interviewed using computer-assisted interviews. Antecedent variables collected at baseline (Wave 1) were examined as predictors of the initiation of sipping/tasting alcohol in childhood (before age 12) amongWave 1 abstainers (n = 286). Results: Ninety-four children initiated sipping/tasting alcohol in a nonreligious context between baseline and <b>turning</b> age 12. <b>Initiation</b> of sipping/tasting did not generally relate to baseline variable...|$|R
40|$|External bonding {{of fiber}} {{reinforced}} plastic (FRP) strips to reinforced concrete (RC) beams can significantly improve the ultimate flexural strength of RC beams, but often {{at the expense of}} ductility of the beam. In an effort to further enhance the structural performance of strengthened RC beams, taper ended FRP strips have been successfully employed: tapered FRP strips improved both the load carrying capacity and the corresponding deflection beyond those of the beams bonded with FRP strips of a constant thickness. The objective {{of this paper is to}} further confirm our previous experimental observations with numerical analysis and to propose a practical guideline to optimize taper ended FRP strip design. The numerical study based on the finite element method suggests that the improvements of strengthening performance due to tapered FRP strips arose from the reduced stress concentrations at the FRP strip ends, which in <b>turn</b> delayed the <b>initiation</b> of cracks that would lead to concrete cover separation. A simple method is introduced to optimize the taper situations for given RC beam dimensions, by taking into consideration the transition between the failure modes of concrete cover separation and interfacial debonding.

40|$|Maintenance of optimal steroidogenic {{capacity}} in the adrenal cortex {{is the result of}} a cAMP-dependent response to the peptide hormone corticotropin (ACTH). The molecular mechanism of this action of ACTH has been examined by using five recombinant DNA clones specific for enzymes of the steroidogenic pathway (P- 450 scc, P- 45011 beta, P- 450 C 21, P- 45017 alpha, and adrenodoxin). The presence of nuclear precursors in steady-state RNA samples derived from cultured bovine adrenocortical cells and moderate increases in the number of RNA chain initiations, as determined by in vitro nuclear run-off assays, indicate that ACTH controls the expression of the gene(s) for each of these proteins at the transcriptional level. The ACTH-mediated increase in accumulation of transcripts specific for steroid hydroxylases in nuclear RNA can be specifically blocked by inhibiting protein synthesis in bovine adrenocortical cell cultures. The steady-state concentrations of nuclear RNA for control genes show no decrease upon cycloheximide treatment. These studies suggest that a primary action of ACTH in the adrenal cortex is to activate (via cAMP) the synthesis of rapidly turning over protein factors that in <b>turn</b> mediate increased <b>initiation</b> of transcription of steroid hydroxylase genes. We propose that these protein factors impart specificity of induction to genes encoding components of this pathway in steroidogenic tissues...|$|R
40|$|Our work {{is devoted}} to the Romanian philosopher and author of fantastic prose, Mircea Eliade. The unique feature of his fiction lies in the {{narrative}} building upon the initiating structure, and reflecting the mythological consciousness, which is perceived by the author as a means of escaping historical relativism. In order to analyse his work we applied the hermeneutic approach, which is in our view best suited for interpretation of Eliade's prose. The hermeneutic approach shows that the author-narrator assumes the function of a religious initiator, who is in possession of a vision of the world and conveys it to his readers. The initiated author can see a different world, a possible world that surpasses the material one, and he is able to bring this vision, inexpressible by words, to the reader. Thus, the process of reading and analysing such a text then <b>turns</b> into gradual <b>initiation</b> into the secrets of existence through its esoteric dimension. Eliade's aim in his fantastic prose is to show that even in the desecrated world the sacred is hidden anywhere and a man is still able to reveal it anytime. Key words: Eliade, initiation, narrator, symbol, sense, hermeneutics, imagination, inner and outer face of literature, sacred, profane, reality, death initiation, dramatic performance, salvation, [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Enadenotucirev is an {{oncolytic}} group B adenovirus {{identified by}} a process of bio-selection for the ability to selectively propagate in and rapidly kill carcinoma cells. It is resistant to inactivation by human blood components, potentially enabling intravenous dosing in patients with metastatic cancer. However, there are no known permissive animal models described for group B adenoviruses that could facilitate a conventional approach to preclinical safety studies. In this manuscript, we describe our tailored preclinical strategy designed to evaluate the key biological properties of enadenotucirev. As enadenotucirev does not replicate in animal cells, a panel of primary human cells {{was used to evaluate}} enadenotucirev replication selectivity in vitro, demonstrating that virus genome levels were > 100 -fold lower in normal cells relative to tumor cells. Acute intravenous tolerability in mice was used to assess virus particle-mediated toxicology and effects on innate immunity. These studies showed that particle toxicity could be ameliorated by dose fractionation, using an initial dose of virus to condition the host such that cytokine responses to subsequent doses were significantly attenuated. This, in <b>turn,</b> supported the <b>initiation</b> of a phase I intravenous clinical trial with a starting dose of 1  × 10 (10) virus particles given on days 1, 3, and 5...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} a general model of {{personnel}} flows and the innovation process is introduced. Part {{of this model}} is tested with data from domestic plant modernization projects. This model suggests that during the initiation phase of radical process innovation, the most likely type of personnel flow to be found is the interfirm movement of managers. During implementation, the model suggests that engineers move intrafirm. For the movement of manufacturing engineers the model {{was found to be}} strongly supported. More specifically, manufacturing engineers tend to be promoted during the implementation process which becomes a major mechanism for technology transfer at the plant and division level. Firms that experiment with new organization structures and policies are more likely to experience this engineering mobility during deployment of integrated, advanced manufacturing technology. Further, this mobility is significantly associated with greater uptime and higher inventory turns for the new manufacturing system. Finally, we found the impact of mobility on performance outcomes generally unaffected by controlling for organization structure (plant size) and corporate budget for these projects. This suggests that firms do proceed from being more flexible to being less flexible as <b>initiation</b> <b>turns</b> into implementation of significant throughput change. Suggestions for future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Uneven {{floor and}} {{fragmentation}} {{play an important}} role in blasting operations due to the direct effects on the efficiency of hauling and loading. This paper focuses on the influences of initiation position on bench blasting in order to improve blasting effects. The numerical simulations of bench blasting at different initiation points (top, middle, and bottom) are implemented based on secondary development of LS-DYNA with a tensile-compressive damage model. The damage spatial distribution characteristics of different initiation points are compared. The outlines of rock foundation and boulder areas are analyzed with the damage threshold of critical breakage that is ascertained by acoustic characteristic of damage rock mass. Results of the numerical simulations demonstrate that different initiation points make a great influence on the stress and energy distribution in blasting process and induce different blasting effects. Middle <b>initiation</b> <b>turns</b> out to be the best initiation to increase the flatness of the floor and decrease the oversize boulder ratio simultaneously, which will increase the damage areas of the bottom and top regions and give a better blasting effect. Field experiment in Baihetan Station was carried out to validate conclusions of numerical simulation. Research could provide a good reference for the improvement of rock blasting...|$|R
