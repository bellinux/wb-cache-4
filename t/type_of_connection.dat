5|$|A-clamp or yoke {{connectors}} - {{the connection}} on the regulator surrounds the valve pillar and presses the output O-ring of the pillar valve against the input {{seat of the}} regulator. The connection is officially described as connection CGA850 yoke. The yoke is screwed down snug by hand (overtightening can make the yoke impossible to remove later without tools) and the seal is created by clamping the O-ring between the surfaces of the regulator and valve. When the valve is opened, cylinder pressure expands the O-ring against the outer surface of the O-ring groove in the valve. Insufficient clamping force may allow the pressure to extrude the O-ring between the valve and regulator faces, resulting in a leak. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>connection</b> is simple, cheap and very widely used worldwide. It has a maximum pressure rating of 232 bar and the weakest part of the seal, the O-ring, is not well protected from overpressurisation.|$|E
5|$|Family {{relationships}} {{are a common}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>connection</b> between gods. Deities often form male and female pairs, reflecting the importance of procreation in Egyptian religious thought. Families of three deities, with a father, mother, and child, represent {{the creation of new}} life and the succession of the father by the child, a pattern that connects divine families with royal succession. Osiris, Isis, and Horus formed the quintessential family of this type. The pattern they set grew more widespread over time, so that many deities in local cult centers, like Ptah, Sekhmet, and their child Nefertum at Memphis and Amun, Mut, and Khonsu at Thebes, were assembled into family triads. Genealogical connections like these are changeable, in keeping with the multiple perspectives in Egyptian belief. Hathor, as a fertility goddess, could act as mother to any child god, including the child form of the sun god, although in other circumstances she was the sun god's daughter.|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, {{we develop}} methods to {{determine}} the existence and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>connections</b> between network nodes when the available data are only states (or signals) of such nodes. The proposed method determines the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>connections</b> by examining the nodes' interaction. Determination inaccuracy caused by different reactive time scales between nodes is addressed by using wavelet analysis. After the network signals are decomposed into signals at different scales, the most prominent scale of each signal is obtained through energy comparison, and then is utilized to calculate connectivity indices which determine the existence and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>connections</b> between nodes. The algorithm developed from the method is tested by applying to a simulated ErbB signaling cascade model...|$|R

2500|$|In geometry, {{the notion}} of a {{connection}} makes precise the idea of transporting data along a curve or family of curves in a parallel and consistent manner. There are various kinds of connections in modern geometry, depending on what sort of data one wants to transport. For instance, an affine connection, the most elementary <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>connection,</b> gives a means for transporting vectors tangent to a manifold from one point to another along a curve. [...] An affine connection is typically given {{in the form of a}} covariant derivative, which gives a means for taking directional derivatives of vector fields: the infinitesimal transport of a vector field in a given direction.|$|E

In this paper, we present a machine learning approach known as Genetic Algorithm (GA), to identify such harmful/attack <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>connections.</b> The algorithm takes into consideration different features in network <b>connections</b> such as <b>type</b> <b>of</b> protocol, network service on the destination and status <b>of</b> the <b>connection</b> to generate a classification rule set. Each rule in rule set identifies a particular attack type. For this experiment, we implemented a GA and trained it on the KDD Cup 99 data set to generate a rule set {{that can be applied}} to the IDS to identify and classify different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> attack <b>connections.</b> Through our experiment, we have developed a rule set comprising of six rules to classify six different attack <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>connections</b> that fall into two classesn namely denial of service and probing attacks. The rule generated works with 100 % accuracy for detecting the denial <b>of</b> service <b>type</b> <b>of</b> attack <b>connections,</b> and with appreciable accuracy for detecting the probe connections. Results from our experiment have given promising results towards applying genetic algorithm for network intrusion detection. 1...|$|R
