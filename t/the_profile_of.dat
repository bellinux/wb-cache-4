5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} {{similar to a}} saw, except {{the height of the}} teeth {{increases}} over the length of the tool. Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining process because it has the feed built into the tool. <b>The</b> <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> the machined surface is always the inverse of <b>the</b> <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> the broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed {{and the size of the}} chip. The broach can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all of the features are built into the broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A broach is effectively a collection of single-point cutting tools arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|E

Research across age groups (elementary, middle and high school), populations (U. S., U.

These profiles have demonstrated both internal and external validity in cross-sectional data. This longitudinal research focuses on students who remain substance free (movement within <b>the</b> <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> prevention) and students who acquire the use of substances over time (movement out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> prevention). ^ This study investigates the acquisition of drinking and smoking among <b>the</b> four <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> preventions as well as the movement within <b>the</b> <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> prevention over time.

Several survivors later claimed to have heard the attacking submarine moving on the surface while they were adrift, and the submarine was seen by the ship's cook, Francis Martin, who was floating alone on a hatch cover, out of sight from the main cluster of survivors.

30|$|Distributed {{denial of}} service (DDoS) attacks, which are a major threat on the Internet, have {{recently}} become more sophisticated {{as a result of}} their ability to exploit application-layer vulnerabilities. Most defense methods are designed for detecting DDoS attacks on IP and TCP layers and consequently have difficulty in detecting this new type of DDoS attack. With <b>the</b> <b>profiling</b> <b>of</b> web browsing behavior, the sequence order of web page requests can be used for detecting the application-layer DDoS (App-DDoS) attacks. However, the sequence order may be more harmful than helpful in <b>the</b> <b>profiling</b> <b>of</b> web browsing behaviors because it varies significantly for different individuals and different browsing behaviors. This article introduces a sequence-order-independent method for <b>the</b> <b>profiling</b> <b>of</b> network traffic and the detection of a new type of App-DDoS attacks. Four attributes are extracted from web page request sequences without consideration of the sequence order of requested pages. A model based on the multiple principal component analysis is proposed for <b>the</b> <b>profiling</b> <b>of</b> normal web browsing behaviors, and its reconstruction error is used as a criterion for detecting DDoS attacks. The proposed method is experimentally confirmed with various types of new App-DDoS attacks.|$|R
