5|$|Environmental {{considerations}} {{taken into}} account when designing the building include the polycarbonate cladding, used for natural light and passive heating; and a hydronic heating and cooling system using the constant temperature of the sea water below the pontoon. As a floating structure, {{it will not be}} affected by rises in the sea level. The gabled roof design is intended <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> with the other buildings in Sullivans Cove including PW1, Elizabeth Street Pier and the Mac02 Cruise Terminal– which themselves are based on the historic use of the area as a freight port.|$|E
5|$|Rebuilding work did {{not begin}} in earnest until 1863, when William Gibbs had the {{property}} substantially remodelled in a Gothic Revival style. William Cubitt & Co. were the builders and John Norton was the architect. Norton's design enveloped the original house. He added an extra floor, two new wings and towers. Norton emphasised the importance of architectural continuity in restoration and rebuilding relating to several historical periods. As a result, while some walls remained plain, others were adorned with Gothic and naturalistic carvings <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> with the previous architectural styles.|$|E

5|$|Usually, {{the episodes}} {{are focused on}} Adam's {{experiences}} at Charles Darwin Middle School due to his inability <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> with his anthropomorphic schoolmates, the challenges that he must face (such as the presumed stupidity of his peers, being schooled in subjects of use only to animals, the introductions of new students of odd, dangerous, or fictional species to the school or the misadventures that Adam stumbles into with them, or the common effects of adolescence as they are experienced by zoo animals).|$|E
5|$|As the {{additional}} main battery turrets with their associated magazines used {{a great amount}} of space within each already-limited ship, Capps was forced to economize in other ways to stay within the tonnage limit. Machinery had to be built smaller than normal <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> the space between the fore and aft magazines, both of which were larger than usual. Boiler rooms were moved inboard to make room for torpedo protection. The biggest drawback was in propulsion: {{there was no room for}} engines that could provide the same amount of power as on previous battleships. Capps suggested cutting down the number of boilers by one-third to make room; it may have been at this point that he considered turbine propulsion, for which he would have needed extra room. All the Bureau of Engineering could offer in response was more compact boiler rooms by eliminating centerline bulkheads.|$|E

5|$|By the 1330s, Southampton's {{prosperity}} {{was in a}} slow decline. In 1338 {{there was}} a successful French attack on the town, during which various buildings were burned and castle was damaged. The house {{may have been one}} of those damaged in the raid, as the south-western corner of the building collapsed around that time and had to be quickly rebuilt; other alterations, including the addition of a fireplace, may have been carried out at the same time. Southampton's economy collapsed {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks and never fully recovered. The character of FrenchStreet began to change, as many houses were sub-divided or redeveloped <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> more buildings. The Medieval Merchant's House ceased to be used by major merchants and by 1392 appears to have been rented out to tenants by Thomas Fryke and John Barflet, the latter a descendent of John Fortin, for whom the house was originally built.|$|E
5|$|Cricket {{followers}} {{from the}} south of England remained slightly distrustful of Hutton owing to the perception that he occasionally carried professionalism to excess. When he was appointed England captain, many in the cricketing establishment held his professionalism against him {{with the result that}} Hutton never felt comfortable dealing with the amateurs who ran English cricket at the time. While captain, he was criticised for caution and negativity but also was expected to lead a successful team at a time when results began to assume a far greater importance than in previous years. Consequently, Hutton never felt secure in the position and was often uncomfortable around the amateur establishment. Like Herbert Sutcliffe, he attempted to alter his accent to match that of leading southern amateurs to help him <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in.</b> But he did not enjoy the attention that went with the captaincy, and he often worried about the impression he was making.|$|E
5|$|In Canada Butlin {{struggled}} <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> {{at school}} and soon left {{for a job in}} a Toronto department store Eatons. In the First World War he enlisted as a bugler in the Canadian Army. After the war, Butlin returned to England, bringing only £5 with him. Investing £4 of that money to hire a stall travelling with his uncle's fair, Butlin discovered that giving his customers a better chance to win brought more custom in, and he quickly became successful. One stall became several, including prominent locations such as Olympia in London, and Butlin soon was able to purchase other fairground equipment, and started his own travelling fair. He proved successful in this endeavour as well, and by 1927 he opened a static fairground in Skegness. Over the next 10 years Butlin expanded his fairground empire, all the time harbouring an idea {{to increase the number of}} patrons in his Skegness site by providing accommodation.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the compounds where a noble gas atom {{is involved in a}} covalent bond, noble gases also form non-covalent compounds. The clathrates, first described in 1949, consist of a noble gas atom trapped within cavities of crystal lattices of certain organic and inorganic substances. The essential condition for their formation is that the guest (noble gas) atoms must be of appropriate size <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> the cavities of the host crystal lattice. For instance, argon, krypton, and xenon form clathrates with hydroquinone, but helium and neon do not because they are too small or insufficiently polarizable to be retained. Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon also form clathrate hydrates, where the noble gas is trapped in ice.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{told the}} court that, during her {{interaction}} with WikiLeaks on IRC and Jabber, she developed a friendship with someone there, believed to be Julian Assange (although neither knew the other's name), which she said made her feel she could be herself. Army investigators found 14 to 15 pages of encrypted chats, in unallocated space on her MacBook's hard drive, between Manning and someone believed to be Assange. She wrote {{in a statement that}} the more she had tried <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> at work, the more alienated she became from everyone around her. The relationship with WikiLeaks had given her a brief respite from the isolation and anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Oberlin’s {{compensation}} policies required Stone to do {{twice the}} labor a male student {{had to do}} to pay the same costs. Stone frequently rose at two o'clock <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> work and study, and she found her health declining. In February 1845, having decided to submit to the injustice no longer, she asked the Faculty Board for the same pay given two lesser-experienced male colleagues. When her request was denied, she resigned her position. Pleading with the faculty to restore Stone, her former students said they would pay Stone “what was right” if the college would not. Stone had planned to borrow money from her father when funds ran out, but Francis Stone, moved by his daughter’s description of her struggles, promised to provide money when needed. Help from home was not needed, however, because after three months of pressure, the faculty yielded and hired Stone back, paying both her and other women student teachers at the same rate paid male student teachers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Objective. To {{investigate}} Portuguese children's health related {{physical fitness}} (HRPF) pass rates, and {{to analyze the}} associations between HRPF and sex, age, physical activity, overweight/obesity and gross motor coordination. Methods. Weight, height, gross motor coordination, physical activity levels and health-related physical fitness were evaluated in 3 699 Azorean children in Portugal, aged 6 to 10 years. Overweight and obesity were classified according to criteria proposed by Cole et al. in the year 2000. Logistic regressions were used to verify the associations. Results. In the total sample, 17. 9 % to 42. 6 % of girls and 39. 5 to 49. 6 % of boys in the different age groups passed all tests. Boys have higher pass rates in push-ups compared with girls. With increasing age there is a lower probability of being fit. Moderately active {{children are more likely}} <b>to</b> be <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> curl-up and push-up and very-active children are more likely <b>to</b> be <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> curl-up, push-up and trunk-lift than less-active children. A higher level of motor coordination is related to a higher probability of being <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> all tests. Overweight children are less likely <b>to</b> be <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> push-up and a 1 -mile run/walk, but are 2. 7 times (95 % CI= 1. 1 - 6. 3) more likely <b>to</b> be <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> trunk-lift. Obese children are less likely <b>to</b> be <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> curl-up, push-up and a 1 -mile walk than normal weight children. Conclusions. The results show low levels of HRPF in Azorean children. HRPF pass rates are positively associated with motor coordination and high levels of PA, and negatively with age, overweight and obesity. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|The {{first time}} the Christmas hymns of the E-flat major version of Bach's Magnificat were printed {{was in the same}} volume as the D major version of the Magnificat, in the 1862 Bach Gesellschaft XI/1 publication, which {{presented}} the hymns in an annex. In that publication the hymns were however not transposed <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> the D major setting of the Magnificat. More recently publishers offer such transposed (and completed) versions of the hymns, {{so that they can be}} performed as part of the D major version of the Magnificat, for instance Novello in 2000 (Neil Jenkins) and Bärenreiter in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} Digital Devil Saga was principally {{composed}} by Shoji Meguro, {{who had worked}} on multiple previous Megami Tensei titles. Some tracks from the first game were composed by Kenichi Tsuchiya. While he had previously been restricted in his music quality by the limited storage space of the CD medium, Meguro was able to play half the tracks using real-time streaming. For the sound compression, Meguro used ATRAC3 compression software. Using the software, Meguro was able <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> high-quality music alongside the sound effects and voice track. Nevertheless, he needed to make some compromises on tracks.|$|E
