5|$|In February 2013, Gavyn Davies for The Financial Times {{emphasized}} that a key {{difference between the}} 1930s and the 21st century outbreaks {{is that in the}} thirties some of the retaliations between countries were carried out not by devaluations, but by increases in import tariffs, which tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> disruptive to international trade.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the writing}} {{received}} mixed reviews, {{the reception of}} the artwork was almost entirely positive. Higgins, recalling the heavy blacks and bold outlines of the original strip, found Critchlow's new style <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> open and expressive. Maxwell also praised Critchlow's development as an artist, judging the comic to be beautifully drawn and coloured with a clear line style. Carter thought that the art was a little flat in places, but nevertheless praised it for being unique {{with a lot of}} character.|$|E

5|$|Northeast Pacific {{resident}} groups tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> vocal than transient {{groups in}} the same waters. Residents feed primarily on Chinook and chum salmon, species that are insensitive to killer whale calls (inferred from the audio-gram of Atlantic salmon). In contrast, the marine mammal prey of transients hear well underwater at the frequencies used in killer whale calls. As such, transients are typically silent, probably to avoid alerting their mammalian prey. They sometimes use a single click (called a cryptic click) rather than the long train of clicks observed in other populations. Residents are only silent when resting.|$|E

5|$|Assuming a {{composition}} {{similar to that}} of Jupiter and that the planet's atmosphere is close to chemical equilibrium, it is predicted that 55 Cancri d is covered in a layer of water clouds: the planet's internal heat probably keeps it too warm to form the ammonia-based clouds that are typical of Jupiter. Its surface gravity is likely to be about 4 to 5 times stronger than Jupiter, or about 10 to 15 times that of Earth which is because the radius of the planet is unlikely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> than Jupiter's and is probably slightly smaller than Jupiter due to the high metal content in the parent star.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Russo-Japanese War the sisters were assigned to the 2nd Division of the 2nd Fleet, although Asama was attached to the 4th Division of Rear Admiral Uryū Sotokichi for operations near Seoul, Korea. Just before the war began, the ship escorted Japanese troop convoys to Chemulpo, Seoul's port on the west coast, and helped to sink the two Russian warships stationed there {{on the first day of}} the war. Tokiwa participated in the Battle of Port Arthur that same day, when Vice Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō led the Combined Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur. Tōgō had expected the earlier surprise night attack by his destroyers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack.|$|E
5|$|Maibaum {{may have}} thought the {{eventual}} oil-rig finale a poor substitute, but it was originally intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> spectacular. Armed frogmen would jump from the helicopters into the sea and attach limpet mines to the rig's legs (this explains why frogmen appear on the movie's poster). Blofeld would have escaped in his BathoSub and Bond would have pursued him, hanging from a weather balloon. The chase would have continued across a salt mine, with the two mortal enemies scrambling over white hills of salt before Blofeld would fall to his death in a salt granulator. Permission was not granted by {{the owners of the}} salt mine. It also made the sequence too long. Further problems followed when the explosives set up for the finale were set off too early; fortunately, a handful of cameras were ready and able to capture the footage.|$|E
50|$|Mantle {{convection}} seems <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> active {{during the}} Hadean period, resulting in gravitational sorting of heavier molten iron, and nickel elements and sulphides in the core, and lighter silicate minerals in the mantle.|$|R
50|$|Transits of Mercury {{with respect}} <b>to</b> Earth <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{frequent}} than transits of Venus, with about 13 or 14 per century, {{in part because}} Mercury <b>is</b> closer <b>to</b> the Sun and orbits it more rapidly.|$|R
5000|$|Verbal nouns are uncontroversially nouns, {{having only}} minor {{syntactic}} differences to distinguish them from pure nouns like 'mountain'. There are some minor distinctions within verbal nouns, most notably that some primarily conjugate as [...] (-wo suru) (with a particle), more like nouns, while others primarily conjugate as [...] (-suru), {{and others are}} common either way. For example, [...] (<b>to</b> experience) <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> common than [...] (keiken suru), while [...] (<b>to</b> pardon) <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> common than [...] (kanben wo suru). Nominal adjectives have more syntactic differences versus pure nouns, and traditionally were considered more separate, but they, too, are ultimately a subcategory of nouns.|$|R
5|$|The {{end of the}} 1798 and the {{beginning}} of 1799 marked {{the beginning}} of the War of the Second Coalition. Within about a year of its formation, the Legion had become about 10,000. However, the new series of struggles proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> difficult, as the anti-French coalition advanced upon Italy, now bereft of elite French units which were with Napoleon in Egypt. Overall, 1799 saw the Legions take significant casualties. In mid-1799, the First Legion under General Dąbrowski fought against the Russians at Trebbia (17–19 June 1799), where it suffered heavy casualties (only two of the five battalions survived the battle, and Dąbrowski was wounded). Polish legionaries also fought at the Battle of Novi (15 July 1799), and the Second Battle of Zurich (26 September).|$|E
5|$|The sisters {{spent most}} of the Russo-Japanese War as flagships {{together}} in the 2nd Division of the 2nd Fleet; Iwate for the divisional commander, Rear Admiral Misu Sotarō, and Izumo for the fleet commander, Vice Admiral Kamimura Hikonojō. They participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904, when Vice Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō led the Combined Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur. Tōgō had expected the earlier surprise night attack by his destroyers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. Iwate was moderately damaged by the Russians, but Izumo only slightly.|$|E

Tōgō had expected the surprise night attack by his destroyers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. The Japanese ships were spotted by the protected cruiser , which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russians. Tōgō chose to attack the Russian coastal defenses with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese eight- and six-inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships, which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect. Although many ships on both sides were hit, Russian casualties numbered some 150, while the Japanese suffered roughly 90 killed and wounded before Tōgō disengaged.|$|E
