25|$|In Livy’s account <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> {{the peace}} with the Samnites {{had been on a}} thin edge for years. It has also to be noted that Cales was in an {{important}} strategic position not only for the route from Rome to Capua but also for some of the routes which gave access to the mountains of Samnium. Yet the Samnites had not responded militarily to Roman interventions in Campania. One factor might have been the conflict between the Lucanians (the Samnites’ southerly neighbours) and the Greek city of Taras (Tarentum in Latin, modern Taranto) on the Ionian Sea. The Tarentines called for the help of the Greek king Alexander of Epirus, who crossed over to Italy in 334 BC. In 332 BC Alexander landed at Paestum, which was close to Samnium and Campania. The Samnites joined the Lucanians and the two were defeated by Alexander, who then established friendly relations with Rome. However, Alexander was killed in battle in 331 or 330 BC. The grievance of the Samnites about Fregellae might have been an addition to aggravations caused by Roman policy in Campania in the previous eight years.|$|E
25|$|Chimnabai I was {{knowledgeable}} in Bharatanatyam and Carnatic music, {{and brought}} a troupe with her comprising two dancers, two nattuvanars (leaders of Bharatanatyam concerts) and two teachers (Khandwani 2002). Others followed later, including Nattuvanar Appaswamy and his dancer wife Kantimati, who had studied with Kannusamy and Vadively, {{two members of the}} Tanjore Quartet. After the death of Appaswamy in 1939, Kantimati and their son, Guru Shri Kubernath Tanjorkar, left Baroda to teach in Lucknow, and then worked in the film industry in South India until Sayajirao's successor, Pratapsinhrao Gaekwad recalled the family to Baroda in 1949 to teach in the Music Department in the Kalavan Palace, later absorbed into the Maharaja Sayajirao University (Gaston 1996: 158-160). Later Guruvarya Shri Kubernath Tanjorkar established his own Institute, the Tanjore Dance Music & Art Research Centre at Baroda with his son Guru Shri Ramesh Tanjorkar and Guru Smt. Leela R. Tanjorkar (Kubernath Tanjorkar's family is devoted to Bharatnatyam dance now including their grandsons Rajesh and Ashish). So {{what we have here is}} a tradition of very distinguished Bharatanatyam dancers and teachers, members of a family considered an offshoot of the Tanjore Quartet bani (stylistic schools; Gaston 1996: 159), already established in Gujarat by the time Mrinalini set up her own academy. Yet <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> what she did was not new.|$|E

500|$|In {{a special}} {{commentary}} for Hamasaki's compilation album A Ballads (2003), where a third {{version of the}} track is included, she stated that the lyrical content was written in third person perspective, a trait that is shared {{with the rest of}} the album's tracks. She stated that the song is about the third person watching a happy and loving relationship: [...] "It's about lovers who appear to be happy and are living each day in their usual way. But <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> a third person is watching from a distance." [...] The song's title is loosely based on the album's title Loveppears, which was originally planned to be called [...] "Lovers Appear".|$|E
500|$|Erika Ramirez and Andrew Hampp of Billboard {{felt that}} the song mixed [...] "uncanny" [...] styles and noted that as the chorus starts, {{listeners}} [...] "can see Beyonce singing this from the stage surrounded by smoke machines." [...] USA Today writer Elysa Gardner wrote that in [...] "Jealous" [...] along with [...] "Haunted", the singer [...] "embodies success and privilege on the surface, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> her contentment is fragile". Entertainment Weekly writer Nick Catucci observed that the song [...] "treat relationships with the same raw instinct that suffuses her sex songs" [...] on the album. Writing for Clash magazine, Mike Diver praised Beyoncé's vocal performance noting, [...] "When Beyoncé truly unleashes her vocals on ballad-tempo moments... 'Jealous', she immediately casts long shadows over singers who might have tried to shift her from the top table of pop". Mike Wass of Idolator considered [...] "Jealous" [...] to be an update of the singer's [...] "If I Were a Boy", sung by a grown woman. He went on to praise the [...] "frank, honest and vulnerable" [...] characteristics the singer decided to showcase in the song, opposed to her other material where she was reluctant to discuss about them. Wass finished his review by noting that [...] "Jealous" [...] would be a [...] "dark horse for a radio single down the line". Brittany Spanos of The Village Voice described the song as a [...] "grown up version" [...] of [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] with lyrics about [...] "persistent mistrust". Latifah Muhammad of BET deemed the song a [...] "distant cousin" [...] to [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] and stated that its turning point comes during several lines of the bridge.|$|E
500|$|Having {{described}} the track as [...] "eerie", Jason Newman from Fuse added it was suitable for softcore pornography with the singer being [...] "in her best coo". He further {{described it as}} an erotic ballad and a [...] "slow, creeping burn", noting that it sounded like Trent Reznor remixing Madonna's [...] "Justify My Love". [...] Claire Lobenfeld from Complex magazine described it as Beyoncé's version of [...] "Justify My Love". Joey Guerra from the Houston Chronicle {{described the}} song as [...] "ominous". Mike Wass from Idolator felt that the singer explored a new soundscape with [...] "Haunted" [...] with [...] "minimal beats hover like fog". Wass also praised Boots' production and noted that the singer declared her artistic integrity with the lyrics. In {{a review of the}} song, Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times compared its break with Madonna's work during Ray of Light with a chopped and screwed sound characteristic for Houston. Melissa Locker from Time magazine stated that the lyrics of the song were one of the [...] "best humblebrags ever" [...] while also noting that they hinted at the singer [...] "dabbling in fiction". USA Today writer Elysa Gardner wrote that in [...] "Haunted" [...] along with another song on the album, [...] "Jealous", the singer [...] "embodies success and privilege on the surface, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> her contentment is fragile". Korina Lopez of the same publication stated that she seemed [...] "surprisingly in touch with the 9-to-5 grind, echoing her own career frustration". MTV News writer James Montgomery felt that Beyoncé showcased a [...] "newfound sense of self" [...] on the [...] "cold, coital" [...] song. Tim Finney of Complex magazine considered [...] "Ghost" [...] "a collision of opposites... less a song than a transfixing eye-hole glimpse into another, entirely separate world the singer could inhabit if she chose". Deeming the song a [...] "reepy mood piece", Jody Rosen of Vulture noted a lack of a music hook. In the annual Pazz and Jop mass critics poll of the year's best in music in 2013, [...] "Haunted" [...] was ranked at number 228.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} topographic lineament {{as described}} by Raisz is along the scarp on the northeast side of the Wallowa Mountains. [...] However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the trend of the faulting in that area turns more to the south; {{it has been suggested}} the faulting associated with the OWL takes a large step south to the Vale Fault Zone, which connects with the Snake River Fault Zone in Idaho.|$|E
2500|$|Critics of deconstructivism {{see it as}} {{a purely}} formal {{exercise}} with little social significance. Kenneth Frampton finds it [...] "elitist and detached". Nikos Salingaros calls deconstructivism a [...] "viral expression" [...] that invades design thinking in order to build destroyed forms; while curiously similar to both Derrida's and Philip Johnson's descriptions, this is meant as a harsh condemnation of the entire movement. Other criticisms {{are similar to those of}} deconstructivist philosophy—that since the act of deconstructivism is not an empirical process, it can result in whatever an architect wishes, and it thus suffers from a lack of consistency. Today <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the philosophical underpinnings of the beginning of the movement have been lost, and all that is left is the aesthetic of deconstructivism. Other criticisms reject the premise that architecture is a language capable of being the subject of linguistic philosophy, or, if it was a language in the past, critics claim it is no longer. Others question the wisdom and impact on future generations of an architecture that rejects the past and presents no clear values as replacements and which often pursues strategies that are intentionally aggressive to human senses.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Jeremy Clarkson {{wrote an}} article in the Sunday Times about his Yorkshire drive in the moors of the Lexus LFA. Jeremy highly praised the LFA's {{appearance}} and how special it felt both inside and out by saying [...] "It looks very very special and inside it even gets better. Unlike Ferrari that fits buttons everywhere it can find some space, Lexus has thought through everything beautifully in this car. Apart from the switch that engages the reverse, which is behind the mileometer - there's a Spock-like logic to everything. And when you push or pull or engage anything, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> it will continue to work for thousands of years. It is the nicest car interior I've ever encountered and I would never ever tire of the tool that moves all of the dials around". Clarkson highly praised the LFA engine by saying [...] "Then you fire the engine up. Snick it into first, move off and... whoa! The noise beggars belief. This is not a car that shouts, growls or barks. It howls. Up there, on the moors, it sounded otherworldly. Like a werewolf that puts its foot in a gin tap. And while it is not as fast as you were expecting, you quickly realize on damp moorland road that 552 BHP is perfect. Anything more and you're going to be picking heather out of the grille for a month". Clarkson had high praises for LFA's handling and confidence inspiring capabilities as he writes [...] "The LFA inspires tremendous confidence. Then up ahead, Gouge marks in the tarmac show clearly over the years, many a sump have clattered into the road and you brace for impact that never comes. The LFA may be lower than a worm's navel, but so successful is the suspension, it never bottoms out". Clarkson sums up his experience in the LFA by saying [...] "I have to say I absolutely love it. It is an intelligent car built by intelligent people. In some ways it is raw and visceral: In others it is a lesson in common sense. Engine at the front, two seats in the middle and a boot you can use. Despite all of this, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> you are in a real, full-on race car. If cruise control was invented for Nevada, Yorkshire was invented for the LFA. It is a car that reminds you every time you drive it why we have corners." [...] Regarding only 500 LFA's being built at a high price, Clarkson summed it up [...] "The trouble is that there are only 500 being built..still, it {{is not the end of}} the world since you can have the Nissan GT-R. It is nine-tenths as good. But costs almost five times less".|$|E

"My {{original}} landscape etchings are {{bits and}} pieces of <b>a</b> familiar landscape. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of peace and solace within them, of mystery and primal longings.

This dream, recurring all through these twenty or thirty years, must be one of the effects of that heavy seclusion in which I shut myself up for twelve years after leaving college, when everybody moved onward, and left me behind.
