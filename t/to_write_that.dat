5|$|Writing in Storyteller: The Classic that Heralded America's Storytelling Revival, in {{discussing}} the difference between stories that lend themselves well to telling and stories that lend themselves well to reading, Ramon Ross explains Peter Rabbit is a story created for reading. He believes Potter created a good mix of suspense and tension, intermixed with lulls in the action. He goes on <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>that</b> the writing style—"the economy of words, the crisp writing"—lends itself well to a young audience.|$|E
5|$|Nicholas Sander, a Catholic recusant born c. 1530, was {{committed}} to deposing Elizabeth I and re-establishing Catholicism in England. In his De Origine ac Progressu schismatis Anglicani (The Rise and Growth of the Anglican Schism), published in 1585, {{he was the first}} <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>that</b> Anne had six fingers on her right hand. Since physical deformities were generally interpreted as a sign of evil, it is unlikely that Anne Boleyn would have gained Henry's romantic attention had she had any. Upon exhumation in 1876, no abnormalities were discovered. Her frame was described as delicate, approximately 5'3", with finely formed, tapering fingers.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{performance}} of an SSD {{is dependent upon}} a number of factors, including write amplification. Writing to a flash memory device takes longer than reading from it. An SSD generally uses multiple flash memory components connected in parallel to increase performance. If the SSD has a high write amplification, the controller will be required <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>that</b> many more times to the flash memory. This requires even more time to write {{the data from the}} host. An SSD with a low write amplification will not need to write as much data and can therefore be finished writing sooner than a drive with a high write amplification.|$|E

25|$|Co-author of 1633 New York Times {{best-selling author}} David Weber was {{contracted}} for {{no less than}} five books in the series in {{what is called the}} Central European thread or Main thread of the series, but there was a delay before the two authors synchronized their schedules <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>that</b> next mainline sequel, , released in May 2007.|$|E
25|$|Wert wrote a {{considerable}} amount of sacred music, but little of it was published during his lifetime. He published only three books of motets, one in 1566 and the other two in 1581; a few of his works, such as the Missa Dominicalis appeared in anthologies with the music of other composers. His other six masses remained in manuscript, as did the majority of the music he wrote for Santa Barbara in Mantua. Most likely this was because he was commissioned <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>that</b> music, such as his cycle of 127 hymns, specifically for that institution, and his publisher was in Venice.|$|E

25|$|The {{youngest}} of fifteen children of Elliot Macnaghten, the last Chairman of the British East India Company, Macnaghten was educated at Eton. In his memoirs {{he describes his}} schooldays as the happiest of his life, even {{going so far as}} <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>that</b> he knew this to be so as he lived them. After leaving school in 1872, he went to India to run his father's tea estates in Bengal and remained there until 1888, albeit with occasional visits back home. In 1881 he was assaulted by Indian land rioters and as a result, became friends with James Monro, who was District Judge and Inspector-General in the Bombay Presidency at the time.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the loss}} of the titular character, Nation {{considered}} introducing a 'substitute Blake' character in Countdown, the third story he was scheduled <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>that</b> year. It can be speculated that the character of Del Grant, who appears in Countdown, was intended to be this 'Blake substitute'. The 'Blake substitute' also appears in one of the early drafts of Allan Prior's episode Hostage. While Nation's original outline for the two-part series finale involved Jenna and Vila being killed, Boucher was aware that Gan's death had upset some viewers, and chose to have Blake and Jenna disappear from the narrative between the end of Star One and the opening story of Series Three. Travis was killed at the end of Star One, having no Blake upon whom to focus his vendetta against the Liberator crew.|$|E
25|$|Born in {{the small}} {{northern}} Manitoban mining town of Flin Flon, Clarke began playing organized hockey when he was eight years old. Around {{the time he was}} 12 or 13 years old, he learned he had type 1 diabetes. Even though he progressed into a highly touted prospect playing for the Flin Flon Bombers, leading the league in which the Bombers played in scoring in each of his last three years of junior hockey, NHL teams feared Clarke {{would never be able to}} play in the NHL because of his diabetes. Bombers coach Pat Ginnell took Clarke to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota following the 1967–68 season and the doctors concluded that as long as he took care of himself he could play professionally. Ginnell asked the doctors <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>that</b> statement down and when NHL scouts came to watch the Bombers play during the 1968–69 season, Ginnell showed them the doctor's verdict.|$|E

25|$|It was {{edited by}} Macvey Napier, who was {{assisted}} by James Browne, LLD. It consisted of 21 numbered volumes with 17,101 pages and 506 plates. It {{was the first}} edition to include a general index for all articles, a practice that was maintained until 1974. The index was 187 pages, and was either bound alone as an unnumbered thin volume, or was bound together with volume I. Many illustrious contributors were recruited to this edition, including Sir David Brewster, Thomas de Quincey, Antonio Panizzi and Robert Stephenson. James Wilson did all of Zoology, Dr. Hampden did all of Greek philosophy, and William Hosking contributed the excellent article Architecture. Thomas Thomson, who wrote Chemistry for the 3rd edition supplement 40 years earlier, was recruited <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>that</b> article again for the 7th edition. Mathematical diagrams and illustrations were made from woodcuts, {{and for the first}} time in Britannica's history, were printed on the same pages as the text, in addition to the copperplates.|$|E

Henderson continued <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>that</b> [...] "You Don't Know What to Do", along with another album track called [...] "Meteorite", are two of Carey's [...] "most serious-minded performances" [...] on the album, further describing them as [...] "galaxies away" [...] from her 2008 single [...] "I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time".|$|E
