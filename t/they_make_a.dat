5|$|Amelia and Kanyenke {{immediately}} sail to South America, {{where they}} help Simón Bolívar defeat the Spanish. Bolívar offers them guides and, with the Circle's army close behind <b>they</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> dangerous {{passage through the}} bitingly cold Andes and discover the Inca city in Pacamayo Valley. After helping to defend the city from the Circle in a hardfought battle, Amelia finds that Beaumont has once again escaped, {{this time with the}} hijacked barrels of the Fountain's water.|$|E
5|$|Local {{residents}} have {{developed their own}} style in clothing and jewellery, using local products, such as shells. Giving somebody a shell necklace and placing it around the recipients neck is a goodwill and love gesture. <b>They</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> type of sarong, called a pareu, which is typically brightly coloured. Like the other islands of Melanesia such as Fiji and Samoa, the Cook Islanders {{are known for their}} hand-painted and silk-screened dress fabrics. An important practice among women is tivaevae, a type of quilting.|$|E
5|$|Pym and Peters {{hide in the}} {{mountains}} surrounding {{the site of the}} ambush. They discover a labyrinth of passages in the hills with strange marks on the walls, and disagree about whether these are the result of artificial or natural causes. Facing a shortage of food, <b>they</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> desperate run and steal a pirogue from the natives, narrowly escaping from the island and taking one of its inhabitants prisoner.|$|E

At the caves, Charlie searches through Jack Shephard's (Matthew Fox) medicine supply for something to ease his heroin withdrawal. When Jack catches him, Charlie says he has a headache and wants aspirin.|$|E
5|$|The Moon crosses {{from south}} to {{north of the}} {{ecliptic}} at its ascending node, and vice versa at its descending node. However, the nodes of the Moon's orbit are gradually moving in a retrograde motion, due to {{the action of the}} Sun's gravity on the Moon's motion, and <b>they</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> complete circuit every 18.6 years. This regression means that the time between each passage of the Moon through the ascending node is slightly shorter than the sidereal month. This period is called the nodical or draconic month.|$|E
5|$|The roadway runs north {{through town}} passing the Grayling Army Airfield, and BLI-75/M-93 becomes Grayling Highway. Together <b>they</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> right turn onto Hartwick Pines Road when they {{intersect}} Old 27 Road, turning back towards I-75; {{this area is}} part of the Grayling State Forest. The BLI-75 designation ends at I-75 while M-93 continues along Hartwick Pines Road. The M-93 designation ends at the park's former main gate. The roadway continues further into Hartwick Pines State Park as White Road, a rural road that intersects unsigned route County Road 612 north of the park boundaries.|$|E

5|$|With Homer and Lisa re-united, {{he tells}} her that it is all right to take risks in life. The two decide {{to go to the}} museum after all, by {{illegally}} entering since it is now closed. While there, <b>they</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> fascinating discovery that the Orb of Isis is a music box which had gone overlooked by scientists and museum staff. Lisa concludes that what her father said about risks was right– until the alarm goes off and guard dogs chase them out of the building.|$|E
5|$|As {{the pairs}} go their {{separate}} ways, an enforcer for the loan shark {{catches up with}} the duplicated pair {{to get the money}} back and they discover they have no cash. The enforcer orders Brian to decide whether he kills him or Stewie. Brian initially refuses to choose but when he panics, he tells the enforcer to shoot Stewie in the head, killing him, then the enforcer tells Brian to give him the money he and Stewie borrowed and leaves the room. Meanwhile, the real pair worry about getting caught Stewie suggest that <b>they</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> run for it and head home, but Brian fears it will endanger the family. Stewie suggests that perhaps they should kill themselves and Brian reluctantly agrees. They prepare to throw themselves off the top balcony of the hotel but Stewie chickens out at the last second, leaving Brian to fall to his death. A panic-stricken Stewie trips over his backpack and finds the money the other pair had won.|$|E
5|$|Dumbledore picks Harry up {{from his}} aunt and uncle's house, {{intending}} to escort him to the Burrow, home of Harry's best friend Ron. On the way, <b>they</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> detour to the temporary home of Horace Slughorn, former Potions teacher at Hogwarts, and Harry unwittingly helps persuade Slughorn to return to teach. Harry and Dumbledore then proceed to the Burrow, where Hermione has already arrived. The next morning, Harry, Ron, and Hermione get their Ordinary Wizarding Level (O.W.L.) results, along with lists of school supplies. Later, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger follow Draco to Dark Arts supplier Borgin and Burkes. Harry is instantly suspicious of Draco, whom he believes to be a Death Eater.|$|E

5|$|In January {{they find}} a {{restaurant}} that specializes in local cuisine and, previously vegetarians, they cook and eat beef {{for the first time}} in years. Working in Malawi, MacKinnon is struck by the contrast between their western diet and that of the poor country's: there is ample food supplies in Malawi but most is exported to Canada and the United States who buy the food they do not require. The couple learn about Mexican and Maya cuisine while in Merida, Mexico for a wedding. The book ends with an epilogue, written by both Smith and MacKinnon six months after their one-year diet. <b>They</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> symbolic journey to Bamfield, within their 100-mile radius, to collect sea water for its salt and prove they could obtain their own salt supply.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche criticised all {{contemporary}} moral systems, with {{a special}} focus on Christian and Kantian ethics. He argued that all modern ethical systems share two problematic characteristics: first, <b>they</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> metaphysical claim {{about the nature of}} humanity, which must be accepted for the system to have any normative force; and second, the system benefits the interests of certain people, often over those of others. Although Nietzsche's primary objection is not that metaphysical claims about humanity are untenable (he also objected to ethical theories that do not make such claims), his two main targets—Kantianism and Christianity—do make metaphysical claims, which therefore feature prominently in Nietzsche's criticism.|$|E
5|$|Riesling {{wines are}} often {{consumed}} when young, when <b>they</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> fruity and aromatic wine {{which may have}} aromas of green or other apples, grapefruit, peach, gooseberry, honey, rose blossom or cut green grass, and usually a crisp taste due to the high acidity. However, Riesling's naturally high acidity and range of flavours make it suitable for extended aging. International wine expert Michael Broadbent rates aged German Rieslings, some hundreds of years old, highly. Sweet Riesling wines, such as German Trockenbeerenauslese are especially suited for cellaring since the high sugar content provides for additional preservation. However, high quality dry or off-dry Riesling wine is also known to have not just survived but also been enjoyable at an age exceeding 100 years.|$|E

5|$|The pair {{try to kill}} {{themselves}} five times, failing each time. Eventually, <b>they</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> pact to end their lives on 31 December 2009. With 20 days left before their deadline, they decide to fulfill their unrealised wishes and begin a journey together. Kiara helps Akash find a date and shares with him how Kunal cheated on her. The next day, Akash cleans Kiara's messy apartment. Though he cannot swim, Akash is forced to fulfil Kiara's wish to swim in the cold Atlantic Ocean. However, at sea Kiara falls overboard and Akash rescues her. Their yacht drifts away, stranding them. As the two slowly succumb to hypothermia, Kiara continues telling her story to Akash. They are rescued again by the Coast Guard officer who intervened on the bridge.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} about three {{brothers}} who, traveling together, reach a treacherous river. <b>They</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> magical bridge over the river wherein just as they cross, they meet the personification of Death, who is angry for losing three potential victims. He pretends to be impressed by them and grants each a wish as a reward. The oldest brother asks for an unbeatable dueling wand, so Death gives him the Elder Wand. The middle brother asks for the ability to resurrect the dead, so Death gives him the Resurrection Stone. The youngest brother does not trust Death and asks {{for a way to}} stop Death from following him, so Death reluctantly gives him his Cloak of Invisibility. Afterwards, the brothers go their separate ways.|$|E
5|$|The team is {{inserted}} into the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan, where <b>they</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> trek through the mountains. Here, they begin to encounter communications problems, which will {{play a critical role}} in the following events. Upon arriving at their designated location, the SEALs are accidentally discovered by an elderly shepherd and two teenage goat herders. Knowing that if they release them, the herders will likely alert Taliban to their presence, the team is split about whether to kill the herders or not. After a brief debate, Luttrell convinces the others that they will incite backlash if they kill the three herders. The team decides to release them and abort the mission, but before they can escape, they are discovered by Taliban forces. Although they manage to kill several Taliban soldiers, they find themselves heavily outnumbered and at a significant tactical disadvantage. Each of the men suffers serious injuries during the firefight and, in an attempt to flee from the insurgents, they jump off the edge of a precipitous ridge and into a large ravine.|$|E

5|$|The trio {{learn of}} the bull run in Pamplona, which is Imran's choice— {{baffling}} Kabir and Arjun. Imran calls up Laila, who comes along, surprising Arjun. When confronted by his friends, Kabir confesses {{to the other two}} that he is still not ready for a marriage, and that Natasha had gotten the wrong idea (of him proposing to her) on seeing the ring that he had bought for his mother as a birthday present. On the morning of the bull run, Imran suggests <b>they</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> pact to make a promise if they survive the event. Imran vows to publish his poetry (which he has penned down in his private diary), Arjun vows to go to Morocco with Laila, and Kabir promises to tell Natasha that {{he does not want to}} marry her. As they complete the event, the friends gain a renewed sense of their relationships with each other, with others they know, and with themselves.|$|E
5|$|Chris (Rob Lowe) has fired Denis Cooper, {{the former}} health {{department}} public relations director, who hung posters around city hall to publicly condemn his adulterous wife. Leslie (Amy Poehler) suggests Ann (Rashida Jones) replace him, mainly {{because they can}} spend more time together, since Ann has been so busy dating numerous men. Although reluctant to leave {{her job as a}} nurse, Ann agrees to attend the job interview, and Leslie provides her with an overwhelming amount of reading material to prepare for it. Meanwhile, Tom (Aziz Ansari) encourages the parks department to attend the Snakehole Lounge, a nightclub he partially owns with his friend Jean-Ralphio Saperstein (Ben Schwartz), for the unveiling of his new alcoholic beverage, Snake Juice. Tom also encourages them to spread the word about the drink through word of mouth guerilla marketing. April (Aubrey Plaza) shows little interest in attending, until Andy (Chris Pratt) suggests <b>they</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> game of it by role-playing as different people at the bar. April pretends to be Janet Snakehole, an aristocratic widow with a dark secret, while Andy poses as his frequent alter-ego, FBI agent Burt Macklin.|$|E
5|$|In the {{cultures}} of ancient Greece and ancient Rome, animal stereotypes grew until {{by the time of}} Virgil, animal epithets could be applied to anything from an abstract concept like love or fear, to a whole civilisation. An author could use an animal's name to emphasise a theme or to provide an overview of a complex epic tale. For example, Homer uses animal similes in the Iliad and the Odyssey, where the lion symbolises qualities such as bravery. This leads up to the lion simile {{at the end of the}} Odyssey, where in Book 22 Odysseus kills all Penelope's suitors. In the Iliad, Homer compares the Trojans to stridulating grasshoppers, which the classicist Gordon Lindsay Campbell believes to imply that <b>they</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> lot of noise but are weaker and less determined than they think. In the Aeneid, Book 4, Virgil compares the world of Dido, queen of Carthage, with a colony of ants. Campbell argues that Dido's people are hardworking, strong, unfailingly loyal, organised, and self-regulating: just the sort of world that the hero Aeneas would like to create. But, Campbell argues, the simile also suggests that Carthage's civilisation is fragile and insignificant, and could readily be destroyed.|$|E
