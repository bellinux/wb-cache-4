The NESCo representatives argued {{that although the}} company already supplied around 85% of the North East region, {{a great deal more}} generating capacity would need to be built to meet the demand for years to come, and that the mid-Durham area was the best place to erect a new station. Henderson claimed the only real opposition to the scheme was that it would interfere with <b>the</b> <b>amenities</b> of Durham. John Hacking, chief engineer of the Central Electricity Board, backed NESCo because if the scheme were declined, and consent and new arrangements had to be made, they would have no new plant in operation until after 1948.|$|E
40|$|Neighborhood amenities, {{including}} public services, vary across locations, and a wellknown theorem {{says that}} households {{with a higher}} marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) for an amenity sort into locations where <b>the</b> <b>amenity</b> is better. A higher MWTP is equivalent to a steeper bid function for <b>the</b> <b>amenity,</b> and <b>the</b> housing price function, which is the envelope of the household bid functions, reflects this sorting process. This note shows how the resulting equilibrium relationship between MWTP and <b>the</b> <b>amenity</b> depends on <b>the</b> distributions of these two variables and derives equilibrium expressions for <b>the</b> <b>amenity</b> level {{as a function of}} a household’s MWTP...|$|R

5|$|The University of King's College is a {{post-secondary}} {{institution in}} Halifax affiliated with Dalhousie. Established in 1789, {{it was the}} first post-secondary institution in English Canada and the oldest English-speaking Commonwealth university outside the United Kingdom. The University of King's College was formerly an independent institution located in Windsor, Nova Scotia, until 1920, when a fire ravaged its campus. To continue operation, the University of King's College accepted a generous grant from the Carnegie Foundation, although the terms of the grant required that it move to Halifax and enter into association with Dalhousie. Under the agreement, King's agreed to pay the salaries of a number of Dalhousie professors, who in turn were to help in the management and academic life of the college. Students at King's were to have access to all of <b>the</b> <b>amenities</b> Dalhousie, and the academic programs at King's would fold into the College of Arts and Sciences at Dalhousie. Presently, students of both institutions are allowed to switch between the two throughout their enrolment. In spite of the shared academic programs and facilities, the University of King's College maintains its own scholarships, bursaries, athletics programs, and student residences.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of as comprehensive as possible damage cost estimates to cost benefit analyses of global attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, few researchers have attempted to monetize the direct impact of climate change on house-holds. This study uses the hedonic technique to measure <b>the</b> <b>amenity</b> value of <b>the</b> climate to German households. Evidence suggests that <b>the</b> <b>amenity</b> value of climate variables is capitalized mainly into hedonic house price differentials. Overall, German households appear to prefer warmer winters with less rainfall. Combining estimates of <b>amenity</b> values with <b>the</b> predicted changes in climate associated with the IPCC’s A 2 emissions scenario {{we find that the}} overall impact of climate change on German households, whilst negative, is typically not statistically different from zero.
