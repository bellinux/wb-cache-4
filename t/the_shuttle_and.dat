5|$|In chapter 157 of Njáls saga, a {{man named}} Dörruð {{witnesses}} 12 people riding together to a stone hut on Good Friday in Caithness. The 12 go into the hut and Dörruð can no longer see them. Dörruð goes to the hut, and looks through a chink in the wall. He sees that there are women within, {{and that they have}} set up a particular loom; the heads of men are the weights, the entrails of men are the warp and weft, a sword is <b>the</b> <b>shuttle,</b> <b>and</b> the reels are composed of arrows. The women sing a song called Darraðarljóð, which Dörruð memorizes.|$|E
5|$|On the planet, Gralik {{explains}} that Degra {{told him that}} the kemocite was for research, and explains how the Avian race were assumed to be made extinct in the Xindi Civil War. A Reptilian shuttle arrives early, carrying Degra, to collect the final shipment of kemocite. Gralik takes the away team to a cave that will protect them from scans, but they are soon attacked by robotic drones sent by the Reptilians. When Gralik returns home, he is confronted by Degra, who reveals the true purpose of the kemocite, to build a weapon to destroy a ruthless alien species. T'Pol in the meantime has modified the canister of kemocite so that the ship can track it. Archer manages to sneak it aboard <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> <b>and</b> after the Reptilians leave, Archer thanks Gralik for his trust and help.|$|E

40|$|Manned space {{vehicles}} {{have a common}} requirement to remove the Carbon Dioxide (CO 2) created by the metabolic processes of the crew. <b>The</b> Space <b>Shuttle</b> <b>and</b> International Space Station (ISS) each have systems in place to allow control and removal of CO 2 from the habitable cabin environment. During periods where <b>the</b> Space <b>Shuttle</b> is docked to ISS, known as joint docked operations, <b>the</b> Space <b>Shuttle</b> <b>and</b> ISS share a common atmosphere environment. During this period there is an elevated production of CO 2 caused by the combined metabolic activity of <b>the</b> Space <b>Shuttle</b> <b>and</b> ISS crew. This elevated CO 2 production, combined with the large effective atmosphere created by the collective volumes of the docked vehicles, creates {{a unique set of}} requirements for CO 2 removal. This paper will describe the individual CO 2 control plans implemented by <b>the</b> Space <b>Shuttle</b> <b>and</b> ISS engineering teams, as well as the integrated plans used when both vehicles are docked. In addition, the paper will discuss some of the issues and anomalies experienced by both engineering teams...|$|R
5|$|The away team scans Armus' energy field, {{finding that}} when Armus engulfs <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> <b>and</b> speaks to Troi, expressing his remorse and pity, the field disrupting their {{transporter}} signals is weakened which could {{allow them to}} beam Troi and the pilot out of the shuttle. After Armus toys with Troi by completely engulfing Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Captain Picard beams down to speak to Armus directly, sending {{the rest of the}} away team to the ship. Picard engages Armus in a heated discussion to discover its motive, which is to seek revenge on those that abandoned it on Vagra II. Armus is riled to a point where the energy field is dissipated enough, allowing for Picard, Troi and the pilot to be safely beamed back to the Enterprise. After destroying the shuttlecraft from orbit, Picard orders a quarantine on Vagra II.|$|E
25|$|Shuttle {{crew members}} were awakened at 06:29 UTC. Undocking {{operations}} began {{about an hour}} before the separation of <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> <b>and</b> the Space Station. The two spacecraft undocked at 09:53 UTC. The total docked time was 6 days, 17 hours and 2 minutes. After undocking, Wilmore piloted Atlantis to a point about 450 feet ahead of the station, then, began a flyaround. Once the flyaround was completed, Atlantis performed separation burns to increase the distance between <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> <b>and</b> the ISS and left the Space Station complex area at about 10:36 UTC.|$|E
25|$|The STS-135 crew {{returned}} the MPLM back to Atlantis's payload bay on flight day 12, closed the hatches between the Space Station and <b>the</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>and</b> prepared for next day's undocking.|$|E

25|$|On July 22, 2001, {{the north}} side (Sixth Avenue Line) tracks of the Manhattan Bridge closed; B and Q service on the IND line was {{replaced}} with a full-time shuttle via the Sixth Avenue Line.

25|$|The role {{of other}} Atlantis and Space Station crew members were mostly on {{supporting}} the spacewalk and completing cargo transfers between <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> <b>and</b> the ISS.

25|$|Two {{versions}} were built. The {{first was}} intended for exterior filming, while the second version opened up to reveal interior sets and allow a variety of camera angles.

Richard Datin build a miniature model of <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> <b>and</b> a corresponding shuttlebay for the sum of $2,100, which was charged to the episode budget.
