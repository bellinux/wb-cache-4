5|$|As of 30 September 2017, 67 A318s {{remained}} in service with five airlines, {{in addition to}} governments, executive and private jets and undisclosed operators. Most A318 aircraft retired from airline service have been scrapped due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> and components being more valuable than whole aircraft. Frontier Airlines, the launch customer that acquired A318 aircraft between 2003 and 2007, retired their last A318 by 2013.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{supplying}} air <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> {{the intake}} also supplied air through the ramp bleed to the propelling nozzle. The nozzle ejector (or aerodynamic) design, with variable exit area and secondary {{flow from the}} intake, contributed to good expansion efficiency from take-off to cruise.|$|E
5|$|Building on the {{features}} of the XT, Ford Australia at one point considered not releasing the sports-oriented Falcon XR6 because of the new XR6 Turbo model. However, Ford overturned this decision before production. A specifically designed body kit distinguished the XR6 from other variants, except for the XR6 Turbo and XR8 which shared the sports bodywork. The naturally aspirated engine was identical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> used on the XT and Futura, and the five-speed manual transmission came as standard.|$|E

5|$|In December 1939, Centaur {{underwent}} a minor refit in Hong Kong, with a supercharger {{and a new}} propeller fitted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> The supercharger broke down in April 1942, {{and could not be}} repaired because of equipment shortages and restricted dockyard access caused by World War II.|$|E
5|$|Mad Max {{is powered}} by the Avalanche Engine, an {{in-house}} proprietary engine developed by Avalanche and also used in Just Cause 2. According to lead graphics designer Alvar Jansson, new graphical features were introduced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> during the development of Mad Max and it was designed and optimized for open-world games. The team also worked on improving the world's draw distance and ensuring that gameplay across the three major platforms have no significant difference.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Merlin's {{technical}} improvements {{resulted from}} more efficient superchargers, designed by Stanley Hooker, {{and the introduction}} of aviation fuel with increased octane ratings. Numerous detail changes were made internally and externally <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> to withstand increased power ratings and to incorporate advances in engineering practices.|$|E

5|$|The Yugoslav {{emphasis}} on anti-aircraft defense meant that Split {{could only have}} a single funnel to allow the guns as much freedom to fire as possible, which dictated that the boiler rooms were adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> room. This meant that a single torpedo hit in the machinery spaces could immobilize the ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{transmission}} of the T-26 consisted of single-disc main dry clutch, a gearbox with five gears in the front part of the vehicle, steering clutches, final drives and band brakes. The gearbox was connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> by a drive shaft passing through the vehicle. A gear change lever was mounted directly on the gearbox.|$|E

5|$|Early {{passenger}} carriages were of similar design {{to those used}} on railways in England at the time, holding eighteen passengers on first class carriages, and thirty on second class. Third class carriages originally had seats, but on 15 April 1840 a board decision declared that all future third class carriages were to be made without seats. All existing third class carriages also had their seats removed. A later board decision on 3 July 1840 ordered that third class carriages would be situated closest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> followed by second class, with first class at the rear.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s Boeing {{selected}} the CFM56-3 to exclusively power the Boeing 737-300 variant. The 737 wings were {{closer to the}} ground than previous applications for the CFM56, necessitating several modifications <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> The fan diameter was reduced, which reduced the bypass ratio, and the engine accessory gearbox was moved {{from the bottom of}} the engine (the 6o'clock position) to the 9o'clock position, giving the engine nacelle its distinctive flat-bottomed shape. The overall thrust was also reduced, from , mostly due to the reduction in bypass ratio.|$|E
5|$|Most {{variants}} of the CFM56 feature a single-annular combustor. An annular combustor is a continuous ring where fuel is {{injected into the}} airflow and ignited, raising the pressure and temperature of the flow. Other types of combustors include can combustors, where each combustion chamber is separate, and canannular which is a hybrid of the two. Fuel injection is regulated by a Hydromechanical Unit (HMU), built by Honeywell. The HMU regulates the amount of fuel delivered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> {{by means of an}} electrohydraulic servo valve that, in turn, drives a fuel metering valve, that provides information to the full authority digital engine controller (FADEC).|$|E

50|$|The Lanchester Ten and Lanchester Eleven {{were sold}} by The Lanchester Motor Company Limited from the Ten's {{announcement}} in September 1932 until 1951. Quite different from previous Lanchesters, the Ten {{was the second}} (it followed the Lanchester 15/18) of Lanchester's new owner's new Daimler-linked Lanchester range. The names Ten and Eleven referred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> rating for <b>the</b> annual tax and did not relate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> power output.|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{after takeoff}} at 16.27 BST (15.27 GMT) on 8 April 1968, {{according}} to the investigations of Rolls-Royce, the 5th stage low-pressure compressor wheel failed in fatigue at the run out radius of the wheel web with the rim, causing secondary failures to other wheels {{and other parts of}} the engine. The wheel then burst through its casing and disconnected the main fuel pipe, igniting the fuel which was being pumped at 50 gallons (approx. 150kg) per minute. The fire could not be put out because the engine's two extinguishers had become ineffectual following the destruction caused <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> cowling by the broken compressor casing. The ferocity of the blaze soon after caused the engine pylon to fatally weaken, which when it gave way, led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> falling off of the wing. However, the fuel booster pump continued to function, intensifying the fire until it spread to the wing itself, sweeping back from forward of the leading edge towards the tail. Upon landing, the application of reverse thrust and the westerly crosswind on runway 05R blew the flames underneath the wing and set light to the fuselage. The rapidly intensifying fire then spread under the plane and ignited the fuel lines and oxygen tanks, which, within seconds of the aircraft coming to a stop, caused a series of explosions that broke through the fuselage and set fire to the cabin, ultimately resulting in the deaths of five people.|$|E
5|$|The game {{used the}} Infinity Engine, a game engine {{initially}} developed by BioWare for Baldur's Gate. However, Planescape: Torment was being developed using the Infinity Engine before Baldur's Gate had been released, leaving the engine's acceptance {{in the market}} still unknown. Black Isle made modifications <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> to suit the game. For example, playable characters were able to run, and both the character sprites and backgrounds were larger and more detailed. The greater size and detail was achieved by bringing the perspective closer to the ground. Magic was also {{an important part of}} the game's design, and a team of four designers worked solely on the visuals and mechanics of spells.|$|E
5|$|The only {{abnormality}} {{found in}} all four engines was the vapour vent float in the fuel strainer chamber of the carburettors. The floats had been crushed by extreme fuel pressure. Inquiries were made <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> manufacturer and other civil aviation authorities but none had prior experience of vapour vent floats collapsing. Tests on carburettors were also carried out in Australia by the Aeronautical Research Laboratories but without finding any suitable explanation. Whether the floats were crushed in flight or in the crash could not be determined, {{but even if it}} had occurred in flight it would not have affected operation of the engines.|$|E

5|$|The rocket {{lands in}} the Hipparchus Crater, with Tintin being the first human {{to step on the}} Moon. Three days later, Haddock, Wolff and Tintin take the {{battery-powered}} tank to explore some stalactite caves {{in the direction of the}} Ptolemaeus Crater; inside a cave Snowy slips into an ice-covered chasm, but Tintin rescues him. Later aboard the ship, Tintin is overwhelmed by a third stowaway, Colonel Jorgen, a spy who had been smuggled aboard by Wolff, who has been blackmailed by a foreign power for which Jorgen works. With Wolff's help, Jorgen seeks to hijack the ship and return it to Earth, but is foiled by Tintin through emergency sabotage that cuts power <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
5|$|The team {{created new}} engines {{to satisfy their}} needs for the game. The {{artificial}} intelligence was created to coordinate with players; the addition of Ellie as artificial intelligence was a major contributor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> The lighting engine was also re-created to incorporate soft light, in which the sunlight seeps in through spaces and reflects off surfaces. The gameplay introduced difficulty to the team, as they felt that every mechanic required thorough analysis. The game's user interface design also underwent various iterations throughout development.|$|E
5|$|The tests {{conducted}} {{in preparation for}} the parade revealed a number of flaws in the design including poor directional stability, a cramped cockpit without heating or ventilation, poor access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> inadequate fuel capacity, compounded by the lack of a fuel gauge, and poor elevator control forces. Five aircraft were modified to correct these issues before resuming the factory's testing in late 1946. The modifications were not entirely successful and the lateral stability was now too great and the elevator forces remained too weak. Engine problems, however, plagued the tests as the first prototype alone required four engine changes.|$|E
