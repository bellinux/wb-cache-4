40|$|Automatic {{dependent}} surveillance – broadcast (ADS-B) is {{a central}} component of the NextGen air <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> <b>program.</b> This surveillance technology can replace current secondary surveillance radars (SSR) and improve cockpit situational awareness. The service can improve traffic surveillance capabilities by sharing accurate aircraft position information between pilots and air traffic controllers. In addition, ADS-B provides pilots with weather as well as air traffic information for nearby area. In order to receive these traffic and weather services, a pilot must have appropriate onboard equipment including GPS receiver, Universal Access Transceiver, antenna and multi-function cockpit display which is capable of receiving and displaying information. Compared to traditional surveillance technology used in air traffic control, aircraft updates and broadcasts its information more rapidly with ADS-B since it determines its position via satellite navigation, enabling it to be tracked. ADS-B also has a large coverage including most of areas in the world. This feature is especially helpful in special areas such as mountain area for air traffic controllers. The most important potential of ADS-B is to enable procedures not possible with current SSR that would increase the capacity of airspace system due to its high navigation accuracy. ADS-B {{is also helpful to}} improve the safety in air traffic. However, ADS-B program hasn 2 ̆ 7 t been operating well even though FAA highly recommended it and made rules on it. This paper discussed the basic advantages and disadvantages of ADS-B. The experiment was designed to estimate the navigation accuracy of ADS-B by modeling several flights in MATLAB with data from FAA and IGS and then compare the result in ideal situation with current surveillance technology. The result showed that the accuracy of ADS-B is higher than current radar system in this designed situation. The limit of the experiment and its difference to the real world are discussed in the paper as well. ...|$|E

40|$|Autonomous {{vehicle is}} able to {{facilitate}} road safety and traffic efficiency {{and has become a}} promising trend of future development. With a focus on highways, existing literatures studied the feasibility of autonomous vehicle in continuous traffic flows and the controllability of cooperative driving. However, rare efforts have been made to investigate the <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> strategies in autonomous vehicle environment on urban roads, especially in urban intersections. In autonomous vehicle environment, it is possible to achieve cooperative driving with V 2 V and V 2 I wireless communication. Without signal <b>control,</b> conflicted <b>traffic</b> flows could pass intersections through mutual cooperative, which is a remarkable improvement to existing <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> methods. This paper established a cellular automata model with greedy algorithm for the <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> of intersections in autonomous vehicle environment, with autonomous vehicle platoon as the optimization object.

40|$|II The Federal Aviation Administration {{has responded}} to the steady growth of air traffic and the ensuing {{increase}} in delays at airports by initiating new programs for increasing the efficiency ofexisting air <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> facilities. The Terminal Air <b>Traffic</b> <b>Control</b> Automation (TATCA) <b>program</b> is intended to increase efficiency by providing controllers with planning aids and advisories to help them in vectoring, sequencing, and spacing traffic arriving at busy airports. Two important algorithms in this system allocate arrivals to multiple runways {{and set up the}} best sequences for landing aircraft. This article evaluates the potential for such algorithms to achieve higher throughput with less delay. The results show that, at airports with multiple active runways, the introduction of algorithms for systematic allocation of runways increases throughput considerably. These algorithms are in fact more effective than algorithms that aim at generating optimal landing sequences based on aircraft weight-class inputs. This result is fortuitous because algorithms for optimal sequencing are significantly more difficult to implement in practice than are algorithms fo...|$|R
40|$|Eliminating or {{reducing}} current {{restrictions in}} the air <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> system due to wake vortex considerations would yield increased capacity, decreased delays, and cost savings. Current wake vortex separation standards are widely viewed as very conservative under most conditions. However, scientific uncertainty about wake vortex behavior under different atmospheric conditions remains a barrier to development of an adaptive vortex spacing system. The objective of the wake vortex field measurement efforts during December, 1994 and August, 1995 at Memphis, TN were to record wake vortex behavior for varying atmospheric conditions and types of aircraft. This effort {{is part of a}} larger effort by the NASA Langley Research Center to develop an Aircraft Vortex Spacing System (AVOSS) as an element of the Terminal Area Productivity (TAP) program.
