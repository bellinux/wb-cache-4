Acne commonly occurs in adolescence and affects an estimated 80–90% of teenagers in the Western world. Lower rates are reported in some rural societies.

Although acne becomes less common in adulthood, it persists in nearly half of affected people into their <b>twenties</b> <b>and</b> <b>thirties</b> and a smaller group continue to have difficulties into their forties.|$|E

He also began to edit The New Salt Creek Reader, which had six anthologies by 1974.|$|E
25|$|Bell {{started off}} this series against South Africa by hitting 199 before being {{dismissed}} by Paul Harris, one short of his maiden double century, thus {{becoming the first}} Englishman to be dismissed on 199. After the initial good start to the tour though, Bell struggled to find form and aside from a 50 in the first innings of the third Test. he did not manage to progress much past the <b>twenties</b> <b>and</b> <b>thirties.</b> In the final Test against South Africa he made just 28 runs in the match, being dismissed for 24 in the first innings and just four in the second. In the ODI series, he made good scores {{in the first two}} matches, hitting 35 in the first match before an unbeaten 28 in the second. He made 73 in the first match as England won by 126 runs. He was less impressive in the fourth match at Lord's, making just 13.|$|E
25|$|The Manstein Plan {{is often}} seen as either the result of or {{the cause of a}} mid-20th century Revolution in {{military}} affairs. In the former hypothesis, expounded by Fuller and Basil Liddell Hart immediately after the events, the Manstein Plan is presented as a natural outcome of the evolution of German military thinking in the <b>twenties</b> <b>and</b> <b>thirties</b> by Hans von Seeckt and Guderian, adopting the ideas of Fuller or Liddell Hart. If true, an explicit Blitzkrieg doctrine would have been established by 1939 and been the basis of the plan for the Invasion of Poland; the Manstein Plan would have been its most spectacular implementation. The doctrine would have been reflected in the organisation and equipment of the army and the Luftwaffe and would have been radically different from those of France, Britain and the Soviet Union, except for the contributions of individuals like Mikhail Tukhachevsky, Charles de Gaulle, Fuller and Liddell Hart. That the earliest plans by Halder or Manstein and the final plan by Halder did not conform to this doctrine is an anomaly, to be explained by circumstances.|$|E

25|$|The {{first years}} weren’t that well for NAC, but when NAC {{moved to a}} new stadium ‘t Ploegske the results improved. NAC became one of the topteams in the highest Southern Division. In 1919 NAC became {{champion}} of this competition and was allowed to play the Dutch Champions’ Competition (a small competition in which the champions from the regional divisions would play for the Dutch title). During this competition NAC finished in the last place. In 1920, NAC {{was one of the first}} clubs to play international matches. NAC played a couple of friendly matches, including a match against Real Madrid CF. NAC won this match with 0–4 and the Spanish newspapers called NAC ‘Los muchacos del Breda, maestros del futbol’ (English: The boys from Breda, masters in football). In 1921, NAC celebrated one of its greatest achievements, when they became Dutch football champion. In the Dutch Championship competition, NAC defeated Ajax, Be Quick 1887 and Go Ahead. NAC continued to play soccer on a high level and in the <b>twenties</b> <b>and</b> <b>thirties</b> NAC was considered to be one of the best clubs in Dutch football. During this period NAC won 6 Southern Division titles and the football was deemed technically perfect by press and public.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{his support}} for the LGBT community, and his {{portrayal}} of gay characters in his projects, Franco's sexuality has been a subject of discussion in [...] media sources, relentlessly questioning if he himself is gay. In response to questions regarding his sexuality, he insists he finds plenty more dimensions to the characters than their bedroom proclivities. [...] "Or, you know what," [...] he quipped, [...] "maybe I’m just gay". In a March 2015 interview with Four Two Nine magazine, Franco again opened up about his sexuality, commenting that it is not who you have sex with that defines your sexuality, but instead how you act. [...] "In the <b>twenties</b> <b>and</b> <b>thirties,</b> they used to define homosexuality by how you acted and not by whom you slept with. Sailors would fuck guys all the time, but as long as they behaved in masculine ways, they weren’t considered gay". Franco added, [...] "Well, I like to think that I’m gay in my art and straight in my life".|$|E
500|$|Somerset were {{stripped}} of their first-class status for three reasons: they had not organised and played enough first-class fixtures during the season, their performances were not what was expected from a first-class county, and they had not succeeded in fielding a full side of eleven players in all their matches. An emergency meeting was held in Taunton, during which a new club secretary was appointed, rules were altered, and wealthy benefactors were sought. Despite these widespread changes, Sainsbury retained the club captaincy. In Somerset's first match of 1886, Sainsbury hit his highest score for the county in almost three years, scoring 90 out of a Somerset total of 241. The bowling of Arnold Fothergill helped to restrict their opponents, Warwickshire, in the second innings; but faced with requiring 150 in their second innings for victory, Somerset were bowled out for 58. Throughout 1886, Sainsbury's batting continued to be more fruitful than his efforts in {{the previous two years}} of first-class cricket, and he regularly made scores in the <b>twenties</b> <b>and</b> <b>thirties.</b> He hit 94 from the middle order against the MCC in mid-August, his highest score of the season. Toward the end of the 1886 season the arrival of Sammy Woods and George Nichols vastly improved the quality of the bowling for the county, but 1887 was nevertheless marked by a slow start. A victory over Essex, in which Sainsbury scored 71, was bracketed by heavy losses to Warwickshire and Gloucestershire. Against Hampshire, Sainsbury reached his highest total for Somerset, scoring 164 {{out of a total of}} 315, to help his side on their way to a six-wicket victory. A big win over Warwickshire followed, and the county was said to be [...] "a ship heading out for an ocean of prosperity".|$|E

Jones also surrounded himself with several dozen mostly white, privileged members in their <b>twenties</b> <b>and</b> <b>thirties</b> who had skills in law, accounting, nursing, teaching, music, and administration.
