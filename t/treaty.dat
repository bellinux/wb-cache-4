5|$|After a {{short period}} of demobilization, the major naval nations of the globe began {{programmes}} for increasing the size and number of their capital ships. Wilson's plan for a world-leading set of capital ships led to a Japanese counter-programme, and a plan by the British to build sufficient ships to maintain a navy superior to either. American isolationist feeling and the economic concerns of the others led to the Washington Naval Conference of 1921. The outcome of the conference included the Washington Naval <b>Treaty</b> (also known as the Five-Power <b>treaty),</b> and limitations on the use of submarines. The <b>Treaty</b> prescribed a ratio of 5:5:3:1:1 for capital ships between <b>treaty</b> nations. The <b>treaty</b> recognized the U.S. Navy as being equal to the Royal Navy with 525,000 tons of capital ships and 135,000 tons of aircraft carriers, and the Japanese as the third power. Many older ships were scrapped by the five nations to meet the <b>treaty</b> limitations, and new building of capital ships limited.|$|E

However, the <b>treaty</b> {{did not address the}} situation with the Sami people paying tribute to both Norway and Novgorod, and the practice continued until 1602. While the 1326 <b>treaty</b> did not define the border in detail, it confirmed the 1323 border demarcation, which remained more or less unchanged for the next six hundred years, until 1920.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Treaties</b> are {{the primary}} source of {{international}} law. But little is known about which countries enter into <b>treaties,</b> which forms the <b>treaties</b> take, and which subjects they address. We present an exploratory analysis of a unique dataset of roughly 50, 000 <b>treaties</b> ratified since 1946. We hypothesize that states enter <b>treaties</b> in order to obtain public goods but that the transaction costs of negotiating and enforcing <b>treaties</b> also limit the value of <b>treaties.</b> Simple predictions are that larger and richer states should benefit more from cooperation: therefore, they should be parties to more <b>treaties.</b> Older, less corrupt, and (again) larger states should face lower transaction costs and should belong to more <b>treaties.</b> Consistent with this prediction, these states enter into more bilateral <b>treaties</b> and “closed ” multilateral <b>treaties,</b> but universal multilateral <b>treaties</b> where the benefits of cooperation are more attenuated and the costs of negotiation are low for small states. One of the most striking trends in international relations since World War II has been the proliferation of <b>treaties.</b> States have entered more than 45, 000 bilateral <b>treaties</b> and 8, 000 multilateral <b>treaties</b> since World War II, including more than 600 multilateral <b>treaties</b> sponsored by the United Nations. Although there are no reliable data on <b>treaties</b> prior to World War II, {{there is no doubt that}} the rate of treaty-making, at least among the most active states, has increased dramatically since then. Why do some states enter so man...|$|R

5|$|Following {{the defeat}} of the British and their Indian allies in western Canada, Harrison and Lewis Cass, {{governor}} of the Michigan Territory, were delegated the responsibility for negotiating a peace <b>treaty</b> with the Indians, known as the <b>Treaty</b> of Greenville (1814). In June 1815, at President Madison's request, the U.S. government appointed Harrison to serve as one of the commissioners responsible for negotiating a second postwar <b>treaty</b> with the Indians that became known as the <b>Treaty</b> of Spring Wells (1815). Both treaties were advantageous to the United States. In the Spring Wells <b>treaty</b> the tribes ceded a large tract of land in the west, providing additional land for American purchase and settlement.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, the <b>treaty</b> pushed American {{diplomatic}} relations away from France and towards Great Britain, as the French government {{concluded that it}} violated the Franco-American <b>treaty</b> of 1778, and that the U.S. government had accepted the <b>treaty</b> against the overwhelming public sentiment against it. This set {{up a series of}} diplomatic and political conflicts over the ensuing four years, culminating in {{what became known as the}} Quasi-War. The Jay <b>Treaty</b> also helped ensure American control of its own frontier lands. After the signing of <b>treaty,</b> the British withdrew their support from several Native Americans tribes, while the Spanish, fearing that the Jay <b>Treaty</b> signaled the creation of an Anglo-American alliance, sought to appease the United States.|$|E

50|$|A {{supranational}} union, {{because it}} is an agreement between sovereign states, is based on international <b>treaties.</b> The European <b>treaties</b> in general are different from classical <b>treaties</b> as they are constitutionalizing <b>treaties,</b> that is, they provide the basis for a European level of governance and rule of law. These <b>treaties</b> are similar to the British constitution, in that they are not necessarily a single document. They are based on <b>treaties</b> between its member governments but normally have to undergo closer scrutiny than other <b>treaties</b> because they are more far-ranging, affecting many areas of citizens' lives and livelihoods.|$|R

5|$|Not {{yet ready}} to confront the United States directly, Tecumseh {{found that he was}} opposed by those Native American leaders who had signed the <b>treaty.</b> He {{threatened}} to kill anyone and their followers who carried out the terms of the <b>treaty.</b> Tecumseh began to travel widely, urging warriors to abandon the accommodationist chiefs and to join his resistance at Prophetstown. Tecumseh insisted that the Fort Wayne <b>treaty</b> was illegitimate. In an 1810 meeting with Governor Harrison, he demanded that Harrison nullify the <b>treaty</b> and warned that settlers should not attempt to settle the lands sold in the <b>treaty.</b> Harrison rejected his demands and insisted that the tribes could have individual relations with the United States.|$|E

5|$|The 1922 Washington Naval <b>Treaty</b> was {{a mutual}} naval arms {{limitation}} and disarmament <b>treaty</b> between the five major naval {{powers of the}} time: the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Japan, Italy, and France. One of the main aspects of the <b>treaty</b> was the limitation on the number and size of capital ships each nation possessed; as the RAN was counted {{as part of the}} Royal Navy {{for the purposes of the}} <b>treaty,</b> Australia was one of the battlecruisers nominated for disposal to meet the British limit. The battlecruiser had to be made unusable for warlike activities within six months of the treaty's ratification, then disposed of by scuttling, as Australia did not have the facilities to break her up for scrap, and the British share of target ships was taken up by Royal Navy vessels. This was the only time the Australian military has been affected by a disarmament <b>treaty</b> until the 1997 Ottawa <b>Treaty</b> banning the use of anti-personnel mines.|$|E

5|$|The British had ceded {{some power}} in Egypt with the Anglo-Egyptian <b>Treaty</b> of 1922 {{and more in}} the Anglo-Egyptian <b>Treaty</b> of 1936.

The <b>treaty</b> recognized Egyptian claims of sovereignty in Sudan in return for British rights in the Nile valley and the Suez Canal. It allowed for unrestricted immigration of Egyptians to Sudan and {{for the return of}} Egyptian troops. The Sudanese were not consulted.|$|E
5|$|The German navy {{formally}} transferred {{ownership of}} the vessel to the Turkish government on 2 November. According {{to the terms of}} the <b>Treaty</b> of Sèvres between the Ottoman Empire and the Western Allies, Yavuz was to have been handed over to the Royal Navy as war reparations. After the Turkish War of Independence, led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the <b>Treaty</b> of Sèvres was discarded, and the <b>Treaty</b> of Lausanne was signed in its place in 1923. Under this <b>treaty,</b> the new Turkish republic regained possession of much its fleet, including Yavuz.|$|E
5|$|The Olney–Pauncefote <b>Treaty</b> of 1897 was a {{proposed}} <b>treaty</b> between the United States and Britain in 1897 {{that would have}} required arbitration of major disputes. The <b>treaty</b> {{was rejected by the}} U.S. Senate and never went into effect.|$|E

Some global <b>treaties</b> are specific to particular types of disasters, including environmental <b>treaties</b> and <b>treaties</b> concerning industrial or nuclear accidents. Although these global <b>treaties</b> are legally binding, many are limited in utility as few states have ratified them or they are very limited in scope, geographic reach, or enforceability. In addition, few <b>treaties</b> address international actors other than states or UN agencies.|$|R
