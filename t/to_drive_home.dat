5|$|Horowitz {{points out}} that the film's {{dichotomy}} of absolute good versus absolute evil glosses over the fact that most Holocaust perpetrators were ordinary people; the movie does not explore how the average German rationalized their knowledge of or participation in the Holocaust. Author Jason Epstein commented that the movie gives the impression that if people were smart enough or lucky enough, they could survive the Holocaust; this was not actually the case. Spielberg responded to criticism that Schindler's breakdown as he says farewell is too maudlin and even out of character by pointing out that the scene is needed <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>home</b> the sense of loss and to allow the viewer an opportunity to mourn alongside the characters on the screen.|$|E

5|$|Jim's plan <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>home</b> from Philadelphia {{to see his}} {{daughter}} CeCe's ballet recital hits a snag when a major investor says he is backing out. Jim asks his wife Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to record the recital with her phone, which she agrees to do. During {{the opening of the}} recital, she stops recording to take a phone call informing her that she has been chosen to paint an important public mural. In her excitement, she messes up the recording and fails to record any of CeCe's appearance. Jim calls her that evening to tell her the investor backed out, and his group will have to work long hours to make up the lost funds. He asks her to send him her recording of the recital as a way to cheer him up, and Pam confesses that she did not tape it. She tries to make light of the mishap by making self-deprecating remarks and pointing out that they can get recordings of the recital from other attendees, but he becomes frustrated at her, scolding her and starting a fight over his new job, the time he spends away from the family, and the sacrifices they are making to get their new life to work. After he hangs up, Pam breaks down in tears. A previously unseen boom operator named Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos) enters into the shot and comforts her, and tells the crew to stop filming.|$|E

25|$|On March 15, 1920, {{the first}} day of the blizzard, the school {{dismissed}} its students early to enable them to go home before the storm arrived.

William Miner, who was worried about the blizzard conditions, rode the two miles to the school on a saddle horse to escort his children home.|$|E

500|$|A Momentary Lapse of Reason was {{released}} in September 1987. Storm Thorgerson, whose creative input was absent from The Wall and The Final Cut, designed the album cover. <b>To</b> <b>drive</b> <b>home</b> the point that Waters had left the band, they included a group photograph on the inside cover, the first since Meddle. The album went straight to number three in the UK and the US. Waters commented: [...] "I think it's facile, but a quite clever forgery... The songs are poor in general... Gilmour's lyrics are third-rate." [...] Although Gilmour initially viewed the album as {{a return to the}} band's top form, Wright disagreed, stating: [...] "Roger's criticisms are fair. It's not a band album at all." [...] Q Magazine described the album as essentially a Gilmour solo effort.|$|E

500|$|There {{are other}} {{dimensions}} to the lyrics, with Gaga playing off her image of self-promotion and criticisms directed {{at her with}} the line [...] "I try to sell myself, but I am really laughing because I just want the music not the bling". In a review for Artpop, Simon Chandler from Tiny Mix Tapes gave {{a detailed analysis of}} the lyrical composition. According to him, Gaga wanted to portray her music as boundless in its meaning with [...] "Artpop", but it appeared to be arrogant since most of the conclusions derived about her music is from her public persona created and its media coverage. Chandler believed that the lyrics wanted <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>home</b> a point about Gaga being the center for any discussion. With the previous lyrics, the implication is that Gaga's impassive personality utilizes her music to sell her brand name to the general crowd, and primarily fuels the public interest in her.|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} album, Wentz drew lyrical {{inspiration}} from rapper Lil Wayne, whom he called [...] "the best lyricist of [...]" [...] Speaking of Infinity on Highs lyrical themes, Wentz stated, [...] "On the last record, the lyrics were about 'This is where we're {{going to be}} a year from now, and this is what you're going to be saying about us.' But this time, we realized that a lot of bands should spend less time running their mouths and more time writing their songs." [...] In 2013, Wentz reflected, [...] "on a record like Infinity on High, I feel like I tried really hard to explain my perspective – and when I look back on it in hindsight I think it’s an extremely unrelatable record. Critics felt that much of the lyrics address the band's rise to fame and the pressure of maintaining a loyal fanbase. Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker commented that [...] "The only top-ten acts that talk about fame as much as Fall Out Boy does are rappers, although their take on selling records is less conflicted." [...] Cory Apar of Allmusic opined that [...] "Wentz' lyrics are oftentimes resentful, full of fame-induced angst, and really emphasize his need <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>home</b> his position that stardom has not changed the band." ...|$|E

500|$|One of Walker's tasks was {{to rewrite}} the {{bombardment}} text. He felt it was flawed because it failed <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>home</b> {{what he saw as}} the most important fact, that [...] "bombardment aviation is the basic arm of the air force". Following the views of air power theorists Billy Mitchell, Hugh Trenchard, and Giulio Douhet, Walker enunciated two fundamental principles: that bombardment would take the form of daylight precision bombing; and that it should be directed against critical industrial targets. In his article [...] "Driving Home the Bombardment Attack", published in the Coast Artillery Journal in October 1930, he argued that fighters could not prevent a bombing attack and that [...] "the most efficacious method of stopping a bombardment attack would appear to be an offensive against the bombardment airdrome." [...] The Bomber Mafia argued that bombers flew too high and too fast to be intercepted by fighters, that even if they were intercepted, the bombers had enough firepower to drive off their attackers, and enough armor and resilience to absorb any damage their attackers might attempt to inflict. The Air Corps Tactical School developed a doctrine that became known as industrial web theory, which called for precision attacks against carefully selected critical industrial targets. [...] Walker drove home his belief in bombardment with a famous dictum from his lectures: [...] "A well-organized, well-planned, and well-flown air force attack will constitute an offensive that can not be stopped." ...|$|E
500|$|Careful {{consideration}} {{was given}} to the album's title. The initial three contenders were Signs of Life, Of Promises Broken and Delusions of Maturity. For the first time since 1977's Animals, designer Storm Thorgerson was employed to work on a Pink Floyd studio album cover. His finished design was a long river of hospital beds arranged on a beach, inspired by a phrase from [...] "Yet Another Movie" [...] and Gilmour's vague hint of a design that included a bed in a Mediterranean house, as well as [...] "vestiges of relationships that have evaporated, leaving only echoes". [...] The cover shows hundreds of hospital beds, placed on Saunton Sands in Devon (where some of the scenes for Pink Floyd – The Wall were filmed). [...] The beds were arranged by Thorgerson's colleague Colin Elgie. [...] A hang glider {{can be seen in the}} sky, a clear reference to [...] "Learning to Fly". The photographer, Robert Dowling, won a gold award at the Association of Photographers Awards for the image, which took about two weeks to create. [...] <b>To</b> <b>drive</b> <b>home</b> the message that Waters had left the band, the inner gatefold featured a group photograph – of just Gilmour and Mason – shot by David Bailey. Its inclusion marked the first time since 1971's Meddle that a group photo had been used in the artwork of a Pink Floyd album. Richard Wright was represented only by name, on the credit list, although he also appears in photographs included in later reissues.|$|E
500|$|Relations {{have been}} {{turbulent}} between BA and Unite. In 2007, cabin crew threatened strike action over salary changes {{to be imposed}} by BA management. The strike was called off at the last minute, British Airways losing £80million. In December 2009, a ballot for strike action over Christmas received {{a high level of}} support, action was blocked by a court injunction that deemed the ballot illegal. Negotiations failed to stop strike action in March, BA withdrew perks for strike participants. Allegations were made by the Guardian newspaper that BA had consulted outside firms methods to undermine the unions, the story was later withdrawn. A strike was announced for May 2010, British Airways again sought an injunction. Members of the Socialist Workers Party disrupted negotiations between BA management and Unite to prevent industrial action. Further disruption struck when Derek Simpson, a Unite co-leader, was discovered to have leaked details of confidential negotiations online via Twitter. Industrial action re-emerged in 2017, this time by BA's Mixed Fleet flight attendants, whom were employed on much less favorable pay and terms and conditions compared to previous cabin staff who joined prior to 2010. A ballot for industrial action was distributed to Mixed Fleet crew in November 2016 and resulted in an overwhelming yes majority for industrial action. Unite described Mixed Fleet crew as on [...] "poverty pay", with many Mixed Fleet flight attendants sleeping in their cars in between shifts because they cannot afford the fuel <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>home,</b> or operating while sick as they cannot afford to call in sick and lose their pay for the shift. Unite also blasted BA of removing staff travel concessions, bonus payments and other benefits to all cabin crew who undertook industrial action, as well as strike-breaking tactics such as wet-leasing aircraft from other airlines and offering financial incentives for cabin crew not to strike. The first dates of strikes during Christmas 2016 were cancelled due to pay negotiations. Industrial action by Mixed Fleet commenced in January 2017 after rejecting a pay offer. Strike action continued throughout 2017 in numerous discontinuous periods, resulting in one of the longest running disputes in aviation history. On October 31, 2017, after 85 days of discontinuous industrial action, Mixed Fleet accepted a new pay deal from BA which ended the dispute.|$|E
