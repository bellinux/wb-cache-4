5|$|Postwar Communist {{governments in}} Eastern Europe {{severely}} restricted religious freedoms. Although some priests and religious collaborated with Communist regimes, many were imprisoned, deported or executed and the Church {{was an important}} player {{in the fall of}} Communism in Europe.

The new government also created <b>the</b> <b>Patriotic</b> Church whose unilaterally appointed bishops were initially rejected by Rome before many of them were accepted. In the 1960s, the Cultural Revolution saw the closure of all religious establishments. When Chinese churches eventually reopened, they remained under the control of <b>the</b> <b>Patriotic</b> Church.

5|$|His {{resting place}} is at <b>the</b> <b>Patriotic</b> Martyrs' Cemetery, in Pyongyang.

According to Gabroussenko, Cho's untimely death in 1951 may have spared him his reputation from that loss of official recognition. With the exception of a period in the 1970s when Cho's name was barely mentioned in official publications, his legacy has benefited from continued popularity in North Korea.|$|E
