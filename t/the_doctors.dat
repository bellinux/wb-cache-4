5|$|As Heyer aged {{she began}} to suffer more {{frequent}} health problems. In June 1964, she underwent surgery to remove a kidney stone. Although <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> initially predicted a six-week recovery, after two months they predicted {{that it might be}} a year or longer before she felt completely well. The following year, she suffered a mosquito bite that turned septic, prompting <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> to offer skin grafts. In July 1973 she suffered a slight stroke and spent three weeks in a nursing home. When her brother Boris died later that year, Heyer was too ill to travel to his funeral. She suffered another stroke in February 1974. Three months later, she was diagnosed with lung cancer, which her biographer attributed to the 60–80 cork-tipped cigarettes that Heyer smoked each day (although she said she did not inhale). On 4 July 1974, Heyer died. Her fans learned her married name for the first time from her obituaries.|$|E
5|$|At the hospital, Mulder watches {{through a}} window as Ritter apologizes to Scully, then tells Ritter that he's a lucky man (because Scully survived).

5|$|Charles XI {{had complained}} of stomach pains since 1694. In {{the summer of}} 1696, he asked his doctors for an opinion on the pain as it had {{continuously}} become worse, {{but they had no}} viable cure or treatment for it. He continued to perform his duties as usual, but, in February 1697, the pains became too severe for him to cope and he returned to Stockholm where <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> discovered he had a large, hard lump in his stomach. At this point there was little <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> could do except alleviate the King's pain as best they could. Charles XI died on 5 April 1697, in his forty-first year. An autopsy showed that the King had developed cancer and that it had spread through his entire abdominal cavity.|$|E

50|$|The Great Intelligence {{threatens to}} kill <b>the</b> <b>Doctor's</b> allies unless <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> says {{his name to}} unlock the TARDIS doors. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> refuses, but as he speaks, River says <b>the</b> <b>Doctor's</b> name and unlocks the TARDIS. Inside, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> reveals a {{pulsating}} column of light to be his timestream. The Great Intelligence enters {{it in order to}} undo <b>the</b> <b>Doctor's</b> past as revenge for all the defeats it has been dealt. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> warns that this will prove fatal to the Intelligence, but it sees its own death as a peaceful release, while <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> will be forced to suffer. The Great Intelligence and its Whisper Men disappear into the timeline, and the positive effects of <b>the</b> <b>Doctor's</b> travels begin to be nullified by the Intelligence's interference. Jenny and Strax both disappear.|$|R
50|$|Amy asks <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> to {{name one}} of his {{holidays}} which didn't end in a disaster and <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> recalls Brighton Beach.

5|$|Shepard died {{unexpectedly}} {{during the}} afternoon of March 24, 1893 at his Manhattan residence. Two doctors were attempting to remove a bladder stone from him. They instructed him to eat lightly, only well before the operation. They gave him the anesthetic ether at 12:45p.m. For a few minutes Shepard {{did not seem to}} react, though soon afterward his color started changing and his respiration and pulse dimmed, so administration of ether was stopped, however not enough ether was given to continue with the operation. His condition started to worsen again; <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> suspected food or vomit was blocking his windpipe or bronchial tubes. <b>The</b> <b>doctors</b> then administered oxygen, which helped temporarily; however, at 4:00p.m. his pulse became steadily more feeble, he fell unconscious, and died at 4:10p.m. His cause of death was edema and congestion of the lungs, after the administration of ether, but due to an unknown cause.|$|E

50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> {{destroyed}} Gallifrey and was rendered amnesiac in the aftermath, {{his living}} TARDIS companion Compassion transported <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> to <b>the</b> {{end of the}} 19th century to begin the long process of recovery.

Fitz's own memories about the destruction of Gallifrey also began to disappear, due to <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> subconsciously trying to wipe them. He briefly left <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> in Time Zero to serve as chronicler for an expedition to the Antarctic in 1899, having grown tired of being a sidekick, but returned to <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> when reality faced peril from <b>the</b> <b>Doctor's</b> foe Sabbath.|$|R

5|$|After enjoying life as {{a billionaire}} for a few days, Homer decides to throw a party before Burns returns. He heads to Moe's Tavern to buy some beer and invite his friends to the party.

Back at the Mayo Clinic, Burns discovers that he not only has all previously discovered diseases, but numerous new diseases <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> have just discovered in him. However, the sheer number of diseases prevents any one disease from actually doing harm to him. This leads Burns to (incorrectly) conclude that he is indestructible, even though <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> protest that even a slight breeze could disrupt the balance in his body.|$|E
