5|$|The {{first film}} has around 540 effect shots, the second 799, {{and the third}} 1,488 (2,730 in total). The total {{increases}} to 3,420 with the extended editions. 260 visual effect artists began work on the series, and the number doubled by The Two Towers. The crew, led by Jim Rygiel and Randy Cook, worked long hours, often overnight, to produce special effects within a short space of time. Jackson's active imagination was a driving force. For example, several major shots of Helm's Deep were produced within <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> of post-production of The Two Towers, and the same happened again within <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> on The Return of the King.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{was traded}} to the St. Louis Browns in August 1888, having already {{registered}} 14 wins for the Colonels that year. He earned 11 more wins in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> of the season. He struck out 176 batters and registered a 2.19 earned run average that season, good for fifth among the league's pitchers. The Browns finished 1888 with a fourth consecutive league pennant. However, not long after Chamberlain joined the club, pitcher Nat Hudson left the team to get married. In the World Series, the Browns had only Chamberlain and pitcher Silver King to face a trio of New York Giants pitchers that included future Hall of Famer Tim Keefe.|$|E
5|$|Laying of {{the track}} was {{performed}} by Wiebe, signaling was installed by Norsk Jernbanedrift, Structon Rail installed the overhead wire, and YIT installed the power supply and telecommunications systems. The tunnel has the NSI-63 relay-based signaling system, although it {{was scheduled to be}} replaced by European Rail Traffic Management System shortly after 2015. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> before opening, the Vestfold Line was closed to allow the new and old sections to be connected. This was the most hectic part of construction, as it saw the tracks south of the tunnel be rearranged to allow trains to operate the opposite direction through the loop in Tønsberg. The work was performed by Reinertsen and took 100,000 man-hours.|$|E

5|$|Ocarina of Time was {{released}} to widespread critical acclaim and strong commercial success worldwide. In the United States, over 500,000 preorders were placed, more than tripling {{the number of}} preorders for any previous video game, and more than 1 million copies were sold there {{in less than a}} week. In 1998, 2.5million copies were sold, although it {{was released}} only 39 days {{before the end of the}} year; it earned $150 million in US revenues, higher than any Hollywood film in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> of 1998. In Japan, 820,000 copies were sold in 1998, becoming the tenth best-selling game of that year; a reported 386,234 copies were sold in its first week there, surpassing the 316,000 first-week sales of Metal Gear Solid. In the United Kingdom, 61,232 copies were sold during its first weekend. During its lifetime, Ocarina of Time saw 1.14 million copies sold in Japan, and 7.6million copies worldwide.|$|E

Police put down the failure to convict to the fact that Martin chose to remain silent during the proceedings meaning cross-examination was impossible.|$|R
25|$|The Lord of the Rings film series used many {{groundbreaking}} {{practical and}} digital visual effects. The first film has around 540 effects shots, the second 799, {{and the third}} 1488 (2730 in total). The total moves up to 3420 with the extended cuts. Two hundred and sixty visual effects artists worked on the trilogy, and the number would double by The Two Towers. The crew, led by Jim Rygiel and Randy Cook, would work long and hard hours overnight to produce special effects within a short space of time, especially with Jackson's active imagination. For example, they produced several major shots of Helm's Deep within <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> of post-production of The Two Towers, and {{the same number of}} shots for The Two Towers within <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> on The Return of the King. Despite Weta Workshop being the major stylistic force behind the films, a single scene where Arwen confronts the Black Riders in The Fellowship of the Ring was done by Digital Domain.|$|E

25|$|Language {{development}} and processing begins before birth. Evidence {{has shown that}} there is language development occurring antepartum. DeCasper and Spence performed a study in 1986 by having mothers read aloud {{during the last few}} weeks of pregnancy. When the infants were born, they were then tested. They were read aloud a story while sucking on a pacifier; the story was either the story read by the mother when the infant was in utero or a new story. The pacifier used was able to determine the rate of sucking that the infant was performing. When the story that the mother had read before was heard, the sucking of the pacifier was modified. This did not occur during the story that the infant had not heard before. The results for this experiment had shown that the infants were able to recognize what they had heard in utero, providing insight that language development had been occurring in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> of pregnancy.|$|E

25|$|In week 11 of the 2002 season, McNabb {{suffered}} a broken ankle. On the third {{play of the}} game against the Arizona Cardinals, he was sacked by the Cardinals' Adrian Wilson and LeVar Woods. He fumbled the ball, fell to the ground, and held his right leg. He went to the locker room to have his ankle taped, but returned for the Eagles' second drive. His injury was reported to be a sprained ankle, but X-rays after the game revealed that McNabb had broken his fibula in three places. During the game, however, he was 20-of-25 passing, with 255 yards and four touchdowns. McNabb was out for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> of the regular season. A dominant defense helped A. J. Feeley and Koy Detmer go a combined 5-1 to finish the season. McNabb returned to face the Atlanta Falcons in the playoffs, but he recovered slowly. The Eagles defeated the Falcons 20–6, but were upset at home by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 27–10 in the NFC championship game. Following the broken ankle, McNabb's willingness to run decreased, and his rushing statistics never matched the high standards set in his first 4 years.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, despite missing <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> of the season, Kinsler {{was third}} in the AL in times {{advanced}} from first to third on a single (17), fourth in batting average (.319) and power/speed number (21.3), fifth in steals of third base (8) and [...] "bases taken" [...] (23; advanced on fly balls, passed balls, wild pitches, balks, etc.), sixth in line drive percentage (24%) and in extra base hit percentage (10.8% of all plate appearances), eighth in runs (102) and OPS (.892), ninth in sacrifice hits (8) and home runs on the road (14), and tenth in stolen bases (26; while only being caught twice—a 93% success rate) and lowest strikeout percentage (11.5% of at bats).|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the Pixies {{signed an}} American {{distribution}} deal with major record label Elektra. Around this time, the Pixies {{struck up a}} relationship with the British producer Gil Norton. Norton produced their second full album, Doolittle, which was recorded in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> of 1988 and seen as a departure from the raw sound of Come on Pilgrim and Surfer Rosa. Doolittle had a much cleaner sound, largely due to Norton and the production budget of US$40,000, which was quadruple that of Surfer Rosa. Doolittle featured the single [...] "Here Comes Your Man", which biographers Josh Frank and Caryn Ganz describe as an unusually jaunty and pop-like song for the band. [...] "Monkey Gone to Heaven" [...] was a Top 10 modern rock radio hit in the U.S., and reached the Top 100 in the U.K. Like Surfer Rosa, Doolittle was acclaimed by fans and music critics alike.|$|E

50|$|Foshay’s {{trial was}} a public {{spectacle}} at the time. Journalists, investors, {{and the general public}} all wanted to know how Foshay had misled them. At one point during the trial, Foshay claimed he was colorblind to explain peculiar marks in his accounting books—“in the red” and “in the black” were marked by symbols rather than ink color, when really these marks represented which entries were artificially inflated. <b>The</b> trial <b>lasted</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks.</b> <b>The</b> jury deliberated, but could not reach a consensus. All the male jurors voted for conviction, but Mrs. Genevieve Clark stubbornly held out. A mistrial was declared.|$|R
50|$|CBS {{was sure}} that Lear's {{comeback}} would be successful, {{and in the process}} moved summer reruns of Murder, She Wrote to 9 p.m. in order to air Sunday Dinner on Sunday nights at 8/7c, alongside reruns of Lear's classic All in the Family (at 8:30/7:30c). After two weeks, however, both programs swapped time slots. Neither the press or scheduling helped; <b>the</b> show only <b>lasted</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|R
500|$|In the {{remaining}} 17 weeks of war the Jagdwaffe struggled to recover sufficiently from the 1 January operation to remain an effective force. In strategic terms, German historian Werner Girbig wrote, [...] "Operation Bodenplatte {{amounted to a}} total defeat". The exhausted German units were {{no longer able to}} mount an effective defence of German air space during Operation Plunder and Operation Varsity, the Allied crossing of the Rhine River, or the overall Western Allied invasion of Germany. Subsequent operations were insignificant as a whole, and could not challenge Allied air supremacy. The only service in the Luftwaffe capable of profitable sorties was the night fighter force. In <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> of the war the Luftwaffe was to lose another 200 pilots killed. Girbig wrote, [...] "it was not until the autumn of 1944 that the German fighter forces set foot down the sacrificial path; and it was the controversial Operation Bodenplatte that dealt this force a mortal blow and sealed its fate. What happened from then on {{was no more than a}} dying flicker".|$|E

ISIL [...] fighters have been targeting and [...] "assassinating smugglers who rescue the captives".

The album was {{released}} in July 1992 and eventually a US tour was set up in late November with [...] Paul Di'Anno's Killers. <b>The</b> tour <b>lasted</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> and was a great success for the band. Shortly after in February 1993 the band were dropped from Roadrunner. This came as a sigh of relief for the band as the proper support from Roadrunner never came their way.

50|$|The {{strike was}} coordinated {{and led by}} Aboriginal lawmen Dooley Bin Bin and Clancy McKenna; and Don McLeod, an active unionist {{and member of the}} Communist Party of Australia for a short period. According to McLeod in his book, How the West was Lost self-published in 1984, the strike was planned at an Aboriginal law meeting in 1942 at Skull Springs (east of Nullagine), where a {{massacre}} had previously occurred. The meeting was attended by an estimated 200 senior Aboriginal law men representing twenty three language groups from much of the remote north west of Australia. Discussions were protracted with <b>the</b> meeting <b>lasting</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks.</b> McLeod was given the task of chief negotiator. The strike was postponed until after the Second World War had ended.|$|R
2500|$|Afterward, during {{qualifying}}, forty-nine {{cars were}} entered, but only forty-three was able because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure. Sadler clinched his eighth pole position during his career, {{with a time}} of 27.363, his first since May, 2006 at Talladega Superspeedway. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Biffle. Edwards qualified third, Montoya took fourth, and David Ragan started fifth. Johnson, one of the drivers in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, qualified seventeenth, while Hamlin was scored thirtieth. The six drivers that failed to qualify for the race were J. J. Yeley, Scott Riggs, Michael McDowell, Jeff Green, Josh Wise, [...] and Brian Keselowski. Once the qualifying session completed, Sadler commented, [...] "I’m feeling Superman today! I could sit here and say it is me, or this or that, but [...] Todd Parrott is the man.

2500|$|The Australian {{selectors}} dropped Paul Sheahan (who Don Bradman had tipped as {{the future}} captain of Australia) and Terry Jenner and brought back the experienced fast-medium bowler Alan Connolly and the off-spinner Ashley Mallett, even thought he was not liked by Bill Lawry. England kept the same team from Perth. [...] and decided to field, but rain began to fall before the teams went out and {{after three days of}} continuous rain the match was abandoned without a ball being bowled. Desperate attempts to dry the boggy outfield were made by Ian Johnson and the MCG ground staff, who claimed that [...] "if the match had been in England the teams would have played. The outfield was good, the wicket firm and bowlers' run-ups safe". Each day they announced that play would be able to start [...] "as soon as the rain stopped" [...] to encourage spectators to come to the ground. One English writer said that the 8,000 people who arrived on the Thursday would have 'gladly paid a dollar each to permit the M.C.G. to buy a proper cover'. Sir Cyril Hawker, President of the MCC, and Gubby Allen, the treasurer, happened to be in Melbourne and with David Clark arranged the historic One Day International for the fifth day with Sir Donald Bradman and the Australian Board of Control. They also cancelled the second tour match between Victoria and the MCC so that an extra Test could be played. Ray Illingworth and the England players were not consulted and only found out when Bradman came into the dressing room to thank them for their co-operation. The players had severe misgivings about this state of affairs as the extra Test might cost them the Ashes and cancelled one of their rest days. They now had only five rest days in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> of the tour, and these included official receptions and engagements. There was also the question of pay and it was several weeks before Clark was able to grant an extra £100, long after the Australians had agreed a pay deal with their team.|$|E
