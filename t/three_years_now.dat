NorthSide Festival presents well known bands every year in mid June on large outdoor scenes. It is a new event, founded in 2010, but grew from a one-day event to a three-day festival in its first <b>three</b> <b>years,</b> <b>now</b> with 35,000 paying guests in 2015. Spot festival is aiming to showcase up-and-coming Danish and Scandinavian talents at selected venues of the inner city. The outdoor Grøn Koncert music festival takes place every year in many cities across Denmark, including Aarhus. Danmarks grimmeste festival (lit. Denmark's ugliest Festival) is a small summer music festival held in Skjoldhøjkilen, Brabrand.|$|E
500|$|She met a young poet, Nikolay Gumilev, on Christmas Eve in 1903. Gumilev, {{encouraged}} her to write and pursued her intensely, making numerous marriage proposals starting in 1905. At 17 years old, in his journal Sirius, she published her first poem which could be translated as [...] "On his hand you may see many glittering rings", (1907) signing it [...] "Anna G." [...] She soon became known in St Petersburg's artistic circles, regularly giving public readings. That year, she wrote unenthusiastically to a friend, “He has loved me for <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>now,</b> and I {{believe that it is}} my fate to be his wife. Whether or not I love him, I do not know, {{but it seems to me}} that I do.” [...] She married Gumilev in Kiev in April 1910; however, none of Akhmatova’s family attended the wedding. The couple honeymooned in Paris, and there she met and befriended the Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani.|$|E
500|$|The Joshua Tree was {{released}} in March 1987. The album juxtaposes antipathy towards US foreign policy against the group's deep fascination with the country, its open spaces, freedom, and ideals. The band wanted music {{with a sense of}} location and a [...] "cinematic" [...] quality, and the record's music and lyrics draw on imagery created by American writers whose works the band had been reading. The Joshua Tree was critically acclaimed; Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times said the album [...] "confirms on record what this band has been slowly asserting for <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>now</b> on stage: U2 is what the Rolling Stones ceased being years ago—the greatest rock and roll band in the world". The record went to number one in over 20 countries, including the UK where it received a platinum certification in 48 hours, making it the fastest seller in British chart history. In the US, it spent nine consecutive weeks at number one. The album included the hit singles [...] "With or Without You", [...] "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For", and [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name", the first two of which became the group's only number-one hits in the US. U2 became the fourth rock band to be featured on the cover of Time magazine, which called them [...] "Rock's Hottest Ticket". The album won U2 their first two Grammy Awards, and it brought them a new level of success. Many publications, including Rolling Stone, have cited it as one of rock's greatest. The Joshua Tree Tour was the first tour on which the band played shows in stadiums alongside smaller arena shows. It grossed US$40million and drew 3million attendees.|$|E

500|$|Qs Paul Du Noyer {{said that}} the source of The Joshua Trees [...] "potency lies in a kind of spiritual {{frustration}} – a sense of hunger and tension which roams its every track in search of some climactic moment of release, of fulfilment, that never arrives." [...] He concluded his review by writing that the music [...] "has the one thing vital to worthwhile rock, a thing so often absent: the urge to exist". Spin hailed the record as U2's [...] "first wholly successful album because it finally breaks free from the seductive but limiting chant-and-drone approach of earlier material". The review stated, [...] "There isn't a bad song on the record" [...] and that [...] "every one has a hook". The magazine praised U2 for eschewing ambient experimentation in favour of uncomplicated but layered arrangements. Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times said the album [...] "confirms on record what this band has been slowly asserting for <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>now</b> on stage: U2 is what the Rolling Stones ceased being years ago—the greatest rock and roll band in the world". Hilburn noted that the band showed [...] "sometimes breathtaking signs of growth" [...] and played more [...] "tailored and assured" [...] music. Hot Press editor and longtime U2 supporter Bill Graham said that [...] "The Joshua Tree rescues rock from its decay, bravely and unashamedly basing itself in the mainstream before very cleverly lifting off into several higher dimensions," [...] and that U2 [...] "must be taken very seriously indeed after this revaluation of rock". John Rockwell of The New York Times was complimentary of the band for expanding its musical range but said Bono's vocals were [...] "marred throughout by sobbing affectation" [...] and sounded too much like other singers, resulting in a [...] "curious loss of individuality". The Houston Chronicles Marty Racine felt it has [...] "music that both soothes and inspires, music that is anthemic, music with style". Racine, however, believed the group took itself too seriously, resulting in a record that is [...] "not a whole lot of fun, bordering on the pretentious", which caused him to lose interest by the second side. Robert Christgau from The Village Voice found the lyrics tasteful and the music [...] "mournful and passionate, stately and involved", but lamented what he felt was pompous singing by Bono, calling it [...] "one of the worst cases of significance ever to afflict a deserving candidate for superstardom".|$|E
2500|$|Bernal Díaz del Castillo is the chronicler {{who gives}} the most {{detail about the}} voyage of Hernández de Córdoba; his is also the only first-person account by someone who was present for the entire process. Also, Bernal {{declares}} in his chronicle {{that he had been}} himself a promoter of the project, together with another hundred or so Spaniards who said they had to [...] "occupy themselves". These soldiers and adventurers had been <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>now</b> in the newly settled territory of Cuba, many also having moved there from the colony of Castilla del Oro (Tierra Firme, present-day Panama) under its governor Pedrarias Dávila, where they were apparently surplus to requirements; they complained that [...] "they hadn't done a single thing worth the telling".|$|E
2500|$|On March 27, 2003, Wolfowitz {{told the}} House Appropriations Committee that oil revenue earned by Iraq alone {{would pay for}} Iraq's {{reconstruction}} after the Iraq war; he testified his [...] "rough recollection" [...] was: [...] "The oil revenues of that country could bring between $50 and $100 billion {{over the course of}} the next two or <b>three</b> <b>years.</b> <b>Now,</b> there are a lot of claims on that money, but ... We are dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon." [...] By October of that year, [...] "Lawrence Di Rita, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, said 'prewar estimates that may be borne out in fact are likelier to be more lucky than smart.' [...] added that earlier estimates and statements by Mr. Wolfowitz and others 'oozed with uncertainty.'" [...] Di Rita's comments came as a much less optimistic secret Pentagon study—which had been complete at the time of Wolfowitz's testimony—was coming to public light, and when actual production results in Iraq were coinciding with those projected in the less optimistic Pentagon study.|$|E
