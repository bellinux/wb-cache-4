40|$|With {{tightening}} emission regulations, increased expected fuel economy, {{and longer}} drain intervals impacting on lubricant formulation, {{greater understanding of}} how oil degrades in an automotive engine is becoming ever more important. Equally significant is the effect that this degraded lubricant has on the tribological operation of the engine, particularly its overall internal friction and component wear. In a previous paper, four tests to degrade oil in a single cylinder engine were reported [1]. These tests were set up such that the lubricating oil was degraded in the ring pack {{before returning to the}} sump, where it was sampled and chemical and rheological analysis undertaken. This paper reports the extension of this work using the same Hydra engine and describes how oil has additionally been extracted {{from the rear of the}} <b>top</b> <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> during engine operation. This extracted oil has then been subjected to similar analysis as the sump oil samples in the previous tests, along with additional analysis to look at the tribological properties of the oil using tribometers. The results clearly show significant differences in the rheological, tribological, and chemical properties of the fresh oil and used sump oil samples when compared with the top ring zone (TRZ) oil samples, particularly the effect of load on the levels of volatiles present in the TRZ samples and their effect on traction and friction coefficient values during tribological testing...|$|E
40|$|Reducing {{emissions}} is a {{top priority}} within heavy duty diesel engine development and research. The power cylinder system is a main contributor to emissions and accounts for about 50 % of the total frictional losses found in the engine, so is important to optimize. Reducing frictional losses will lead to reduced consumption of fuel which results in reduced CO 2 emission. It is possible to simplify the experimental testing of engine components by stratified testing, enabling cost-effective screening of candidate material concepts. In a component specific tribometer test, components are studied individually which results in a decreased number of noise factors compared to full scale testing. The vision for general tribological testing {{is to create a}} test environment capable of reproducing full scale engine conditions. The objective of this work is to develop and verify a tribometer test method capable of reproduce the real engine behavior for boundary and mixed lubrication regimes in order to minimize frictional losses and wear. To make sure of an accurate comparison is made between rig parameters and the contact parameters of the engine the Hersey parameter is solved for the contact between top ring and cylinder liner for the engine. The input parameters for the tribometer experiments are then selected so that the test rig reproduces the contact conditions of the <b>top</b> <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> in the engine in the vicinity of combustion top dead centre. Three types of cylinder liner materials/surfaces are tested with a novel type of tribometer test cycle setup were dynamic viscosity, contact pressure and contact velocity are varied according to a design-of-experiment setup. It was shown that for a material/surface with lower friction the importance of dynamic viscosity and velocity increases. For a material/surface with higher friction only contact pressure is of importance. This means that a surface {{has to be able to}} generate conditions for oil film buildup, otherwise the properties of oil and the velocity have little or no significance on friction. For the materials studied in this work it is apparent that surface roughness is important regardless of material properties. The parameters of highest importance for controlling friction are found to be those describing the plateau part of the surface. To better understand the correlations between friction and surface roughness a future study should include a study of similar materials with different roughness values. The effectiveness of the tribometer methodology should also be validated against full-scale tests...|$|E

40|$|In an AC 1 W IDI Lister Petter diesel engine, {{ignition}} delay reduced exponentially {{with an increase}} in engine speed for hempseed oil (HSO), camelina seed oil (CSO) and rapeseed oil (RSO). The polyunsaturated fuels HSO produced {{ignition delay}}s which were 0. 6 to 12. 4 %, 18. 7 to 32. 1 % and 10. 8 to 26. 8 % longer than RSO, rapeseed methyl ester (RME) and mineral diesel (MD) fuel respectively whilst CSO produced ignition delays which were 0 to 9. 8 %, 18. 4 to 29. 1 % and 11. 8 to 24. 8 % longer than RSO, RME and MD fuel respectively. Ignition delays increased with a 5 o Crank Angle (CA) advance in fuel injection timing by 2. 7 to 19. 2 %, 0. 9 to 11. 1 % and 0. 12 to 17. 0 % for RSO, CSO and HSO respectively. A reduction in ignition delay was noted for RSO, CSO and HSO by 5 to 7. 1 %, 1. 4 to 9. 5 % and 7. 9 to 13. 5 % except above 3100 rpm at 5 oCA retarded fuel injection timing. Maximum power outputs of HSO (4. 12 kW), and CSO(4. 38 kW) were lower when compared with MD fuel (4. 43 kW) however maximum power outputs for RSO (4. 47 kW) and RME (4. 63 kW) were both higher when compared with MD fuel (4. 43 kW) at standard fuel injection timing. After 28 days HSO, CSO, RME and WCOME increased in acid value from 8. 1 to 178. 4 % and peroxide value varied from - 63. 64 % to 321. 85 %. Ignition delay, combustion chamber peak pressure signal and rate of pressure rise were unaffected by storage of the oils. Advancing fuel injection timing by 5 oCA in a 1. 5 L Tempest (BMC) engine had no significant effect on the power, torque and BMEP for RME, NOx and smoke emissions increased by 10. 7 to 41. 5 % and by 24. 5 to 74. 3 % respectively and CO reduced by 14. 4 to 21. 6 % at BMEP BMEP> 250 kPa. HSO and CSO gave 4. 9 % and 5. 6 % higher maximum power than RSO, 12. 6 % and 13. 3 % more than RME and WCOME and 17. 4 % and 18. 1 % more than MD fuel respectively in a 1. 8 L NA IDI Ford Courier. HSO used 2. 6 to 15. 9 % and 1. 8 to 11. 2 % more fuel than RME and WCOME respectively whilst CSO used 2. 1 to 16. 3 % and 2. 1 to 12 % more fuel than RME and WCOME respectively except above 3700 rpm. HSO and CSO used 9. 1 to 42. 6 % and 0 to 43. 1 % more fuel than MD fuel for all engine speeds. Mean NOx increased by 11. 4 to 40. 2 % for HSO and 15. 7 to 35. 1 % for CSO above 1800 rpm compared with RME. NOx was higher by 11. 9 to 34. 6 % for HSO and by 16. 2 to 29. 7 % higher for CSO for all engine speeds than WCOME. Both HSO and CSO increased NOx by 6. 9 to 55. 1 % and 5. 1 to 56. 9 % compared with MD fuel above 1800 rpm. RME and WCOME gave 2. 2 to 26. 7 % and 1. 8 to 25 % greater NOx respectively than MD fuel above 3750 rpm. After 492 kWh use, RME gave carbon deposits on cylinder head, valves, piston crown and fuel injector in a 2 kW DI diesel generator and the <b>top</b> <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> was seized. Carbon build up on the inlet valve and port was between 1. 2 x 10 - 3 and 3. 8 x 10 - 3 mm/kWh.

Neoprene and reinforced polyurethane are not suitable materials for RME fuel lines. The use of 100 % RME in a 1. 3 L TDI ESB fleet vehicle resulted in a reduction in the maximum power output (40. 4 kW) of 6. 9 % after 11023 km (nine months) to 37. 6 kW whilst maximum power output (53. 5 kW) reduced by 4. 4 % to 48. 75 kW with the use of 30 %RME/ 70 % MD fuel in a 2. 0 L TDI ESB fleet vehicle after 22459 km (nine months).
