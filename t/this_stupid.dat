So I {{was just}} like, I'm going to make this record, and do <b>this</b> <b>stupid</b> Ozzfest thing, and tell a bunch of stupid jokes in front {{of a lot of people}} at Download, then I'm just going to fuck off for a while. The bigger this gets, the less I care, to the point where I just need to go spend some time with my family. I don't wanna bastardise Strapping and all these other {{projects}} by doing it for the money. Strapping was about the big middle finger, and it still is, but I don't think it needs to go any further than this.|$|E
500|$|David Jaffe, {{creator and}} Game Director of the {{original}} God of War, spoke with NowGamer prior to the first press announcement in late April. He {{said that if he}} had worked on Ascension, he would have incorporated three specific elements: different myths, a co-star, and [...] "look to the Zelda structure as a jumping off point". He liked the idea of a cooperative mode, and added [...] "I'd love to see player one be Kratos and player two be <b>this</b> <b>stupid</b> annoying sidekick that—for some to be determined story reason—Kratos is stuck with for the whole adventure and in the end, once the main quest is over, Kratos just snaps the poor kid's neck". In May 2012, Jaffe spoke with IGN about the multiplayer element: [...] "I think it looks cool. It looks like another great, impeccably executed Sony Santa Monica game", and added, [...] "If {{it turns out to be}} the case that the single player is watered down because of , then I think they have some justification. But I don't see any evidence of that, and I don't see evidence of that based on the team they are." ...|$|E
2500|$|Then Australian Prime Minister John Howard {{asked for}} Big Brother to be cancelled, saying, [...] "Here's a great {{opportunity}} for Channel 10 to do a bit of self-regulation and get <b>this</b> <b>stupid</b> program off the air"; Leader of the Opposition Kim Beazley and Senator Steve Fielding supported this view. Queensland Premier Peter Beattie argued that the show employed many Australians in production and that, because of the already diminished size of the Australian television industry, the show should continue.|$|E

2500|$|Each episode {{ended with}} an {{extended}} instrumental performance of [...] "The Muppet Show Theme" [...] by the Muppet orchestra before Statler and Waldorf gave {{the last laugh}} of the night. Some last laugh sequences featured other Muppets on the balcony. For example, in one episode, the Muppets of Sesame Street appeared behind the duo who told them: [...] "How should {{we know how to}} get to Sesame Street? We don't even know {{how to get out of}} <b>this</b> <b>stupid</b> theater box!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite toning down Big Brother: Adults Only {{significantly}} {{in comparison to}} 2005, the series continued to attract controversy. [...] After Big Brother: Adults Only was abruptly cancelled several weeks early, a subsequent incident of alleged sexual assault in the house saw the removal of two housemates and a huge public outcry calling for the series to be cancelled entirely. This incident generated significant publicity for the show, even prompting the Prime Minister of Australia to call on Network Ten to [...] "do a bit of self-regulation and get <b>this</b> <b>stupid</b> program off the air." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{shall we}} do this rainy day in <b>this</b> <b>stupid</b> place?" [...] said Ethel, one morning when bad weather kept them from an {{excursion}} to Stirling Castle.|$|E
6000|$|The {{story was}} {{produced}} in a paper-covered volume costing a shilling, and was little heeded till a reviewer in The Times [...] "caught <b>this</b> great <b>stupid</b> public by the ear," [...] as Thackeray said.|$|R
5000|$|Brantingham also reached Spiker for comment, {{who told}} the reporter, [...] "I quit using the name. There was no proof, and I decided it just wasnt worth it. <b>This</b> is <b>stupid.</b> I am me, {{and this is my}} face." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> was the <b>stupid</b> lout {{who waited}} at table and {{did most of}} the housework. He came in.|$|R

5000|$|A.E. Housman's [...] "Terence, <b>this</b> is <b>stupid</b> stuff" [...] (originally {{published}} in A Shropshire Lad) invokes mithridatism {{as a metaphor}} for the benefit that serious poetry brings to the reader. The final section is a poetic rendition of the Mithridates legend. (See the text on Wikisource by itself and collected with A Shropshire Lad.) ...|$|R
60|$|The Saddhu {{followed}} the policeman, fawning and supplicating. The ruck of passengers, busy, with their babies and their bundles, {{had not noticed}} the affair.

6000|$|... 'But {{it is not}} {{a pretty}} one,' said little Robina. 'Last year it was green, and before that red; and <b>this</b> is nasty <b>stupid</b> black and white, and all thin {{crackling}} paper.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The sea roads, they're drying up." [...] "The sea is drying up?""Not <b>this</b> sea, <b>Stupid</b> child!" [...] Her tail slapped, sent up a fountain, {{exploding}} and drenching me.

6000|$|... "I confess," [...] said Mrs. Bowen, [...] "that I am rather <b>stupid</b> <b>this</b> morning. I suppose it's the {{softness}} of the air; it's been harsh and irritating so long. It makes me drowsy." ...|$|R

5000|$|Lars and Kirk {{were very}} into {{abstract}} art, pretending they were gay. I think {{they knew it}} bugged me. It was a statement around all that. I love art, {{but not for the}} sake of shocking others. I think the cover of Load was just a piss-take around all that. I just went along with the make-up and all of <b>this</b> crazy, <b>stupid</b> crap that they felt they needed to do.|$|R
6000|$|... 'There's {{no reason}} {{one should not}} make money with pictures,' said Edgar; 'but I'd rather make delight! But it can't be helped, and I am very glad to have done with <b>this</b> <b>stupid</b> place.' ...|$|E

60|$|So be not honest; {{eccentricity}} Is {{not a thing}} {{should ever}} be encouraged, Although, in <b>this</b> dull <b>stupid</b> age of ours, The most eccentric thing a man can do Is to have brains, then the mob mocks at him; And for the mob, despise it as I do, I hold its bubble praise and windy favours In such account, that popularity Is the one insult I have never suffered.|$|R
60|$|Those whims come {{at times}} {{to those who are}} doomed to die. Clyffurde's one hope of peace lay in death upon the battlefield. Life was empty now. He had fought against the burden of {{loneliness}} left upon him when Crystal passed finally out of his life. But the burden had proved unconquerable. Only death could ease him of the load: for life like <b>this</b> was <b>stupid</b> and intolerable.|$|R
6000|$|... "I tell you, my dear," [...] said he, [...] "every one {{who comes}} here makes <b>this</b> place more <b>stupid</b> and dull. I can't see exactly {{any reason for}} it, but these lovers are {{at the bottom of}} it. I hate lovers." ...|$|R
