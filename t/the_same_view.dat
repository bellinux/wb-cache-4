On that basis he separated mercury from the metals. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>view</b> was adopted by Vogel (1755, Institutiones Chemiæ) and Buffon (1785, Histoire Naturelle des Minéraux). In the interim, Braun had observed the solidification of mercury by cold in 1759–60. This was confirmed by Hutchins and Cavendish in 1783. The malleability of mercury then became known, and it was included amongst the metals.|$|E
5|$|Because the new Olimpija is {{supported}} {{by most of the}} fans of the previous Olimpija, including their ultras group, the Green Dragons, who have a long-standing rivalry with Maribor's own ultras group Viole Maribor, many see the matches between Maribor and the new club as the continuation of the rivalry and refer to it by the same name. However, there are many fans, either the ones from Maribor or the ones from Ljubljana, that do not share <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>view</b> and do not share similar beliefs, including part of the media such as RTV Slovenija and Večer. The overall statistics of {{the old and the new}} Olimpija are tracked separately by the Football Association of Slovenia and the Association of 1. SNL. The first match between Maribor and the new Olimpija took place on 24 October 2007 in a Slovenian cup quarter-final match that was won by Maribor, 3–1. At the time, Olimpija was still competing under the name Olimpija Bežigrad. Statistically, Maribor is the more successful club either in the case of matches from the period from 1962 to 2005 or the whole period from 1962 to present day.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi {{reproductive}} {{policies were}} {{a significant factor}} behind their anti-tobacco campaign. Women who smoked {{were considered to be}} vulnerable to premature aging and loss of physical attractiveness; they were viewed as unsuitable to be wives and mothers in a German family. Werner Huttig of the Nazi Party's Rassenpolitisches Amt (Office of Racial Politics) said that a smoking mother's breast milk contained nicotine, a claim that modern research has proven correct. , a prominent physician during the Third Reich, opined that smoking by pregnant women resulted in a higher rate of stillbirths and miscarriages. This opinion was also supported by well-known female racial hygienist Agnes Bluhm, whose book published in 1936 expressed <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>view.</b> The Nazi leadership was concerned over this because they wanted German women to be as reproductive as possible. An article published in a German gynecology journal in 1943 stated that women smoking three or more cigarettes per day were more likely to remain childless compared to nonsmoking women.|$|E

25|$|The {{question}} of Gascon is similar. Gascon presents {{a number of}} significant differences {{from the rest of the}} language; but, despite these differences, Gascon and other Occitan dialects have very important common lexical and grammatical features, so authors such as Pierre Bec argue that they could never be considered as different as, for example, Spanish and Italian. In addition, Gascon's being included in Occitan despite its particular differences can be justified because there is a common elaboration (Ausbau) process between Gascon and the rest of Occitan. The vast majority of the Gascon cultural movement considers itself as a part of the Occitan cultural movement. And the official status of Val d'Aran (Catalonia, Spain), adopted in 1990, says that Aranese is a part of Gascon and Occitan. A grammar of Aranese by Aitor Carrera, published in 2007 in Lleida, presents <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>view.</b>|$|E

25|$|Rhodes and Cordingley were {{competing}} {{for a place}} in the Yorkshire team after the sacking of Bobby Peel in 1897. Cordingley was, at that stage, as well qualified for the position as Rhodes and had good reports from his time playing with Lytham. In a trial match {{at the end of the}} 1897 season, Cordingley took eight wickets for 33 runs for Yorkshire against the Yorkshire Colts team, and also took three wickets against the senior Yorkshire side in another game. In the same games, Rhodes took just two wickets for 99 runs. At the start of the 1898 season, both Cordingley and Rhodes played for Yorkshire Colts against Nottinghamshire Colts; Rhodes took one wicket for 14 and Cordingley took four for 37. Two days later, both men were included in the squad for Yorkshire against the Marylebone Cricket Club (M.C.C.). According to one story, Yorkshire captain Lord Hawke and leading amateur cricketer Stanley Jackson could not agree on which player to leave out, and chose Rhodes after spinning a coin. However, Hawke later denied this was the case. He claimed always to believe Rhodes the better bowler and said that Jackson came to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>view</b> after seeing Rhodes bowling during practice. Rhodes took six for 33 in the game and was chosen to play in the next match, but Cordingley remained in the squad. However, during the game he received news of the death of his mother and returned home. Rhodes meanwhile took 13 wickets in the game and Cordingley accepted that there was no likelihood of taking his place. This gave rise to a legend that after seeing Rhodes bowl in his first match, Cordingley, accepting Rhodes' superiority, shook his hand and returned home without completing the team's tour of the South of England. Rhodes remained in the side for the rest of the season and took 141 wickets for Yorkshire. He was named one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year and played for England the following season. He went on to take 4,184 wickets in a career lasting until 1930.|$|E
25|$|Malaka chose Java island as the {{starting}} point of his struggle, considering that there were many figures who had <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>view</b> as him. He arrived in Batavia when his old teacher, Horensma, offered him a job as a teacher; however, Malaka rejected it. Malaka told that he wanted to establish a school; Horensma accepted the reason and supported him. Malaka arrived at Yogyakarta in early March 1921 and stayed at a house belonging to Sutopo, a former leader of Budi Utomo. There he wrote a proposal about grammar school. He participated in Sarekat Islam's 5th congress and met H.O.S. Tjokroaminoto, Agus Salim, Darsono, and Semaun. The congress discussed the topic of double membership. Agus Salim and Abdul Muis forbade it, while Semaun and Darsono were PKI members. Malaka offered a solution that excluded PKI because both organizations had the same vision; however, the prohibition was applied in the end. Sarekat Islam was split as a result, forming SI Putih (White SI), led by Tjokroaminoto, and SI Merah (Red SI), led by Semaun and based in Semarang. After the congress Malaka was asked by Semaun to go to Semarang to join PKI. He went to Semarang and then accepted it. Arriving in Semarang, Malaka became sick. A month later, he had returned to health and participated in a meeting with fellow SI Semarang members. The meeting concluded that a rival to government schools was needed. The school, named Sekolah Sarekat Islam (which was later better known as Sekolah Tan Malaka, and spread to Bandung and Ternate), opened to enrollment on 21 June 1921, the day after the meeting. As a guidebook for the schools, Malaka wrote SI Semarang dan Onderwijs. In June 1921 Malaka became the chairman of Serikat Pegawai Pertjitakan (Printing Workers Association) and served as the vice chairman and treasurer of Serikat Pegawai Pelikan Hindia (SPPH or Indies Oils Workers Association). Between May and August his first book, Sovjet atau Parlemen? (Soviet or Parliament?), was serialized in PKI's journal Soeara Ra'jat; his other works, including articles, were published in the journal and PKI's newspaper Sinar Hindia. In June {{he was one of the}} leaders of Revolutionaire Vakcentrale and in August he was elected to the editorial board of SPPH's journal Soeara Tambang. Malaka then replaced Semaun, who left the Dutch East Indies in October, as the chairman of PKI after a congress on 24–25 December 1921 in Semarang. Whilst Semaun was more cautious, Malaka was more radical. Malaka also maintained a good relationship with Sarekat Islam. The Dutch East Indies' government felt threatened and arrested Malaka on 13 February 1922 in Bandung when he visited the branch school. He was first exiled to Kupang; however, he wanted to be exiled to the Netherlands. He left the Dutch East Indies in March and arrived in the Netherlands on 1 May.|$|E
