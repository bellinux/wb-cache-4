5|$|In November 2003, {{three months}} before her disappearance, Murray {{admitted}} to using a stolen credit card to order food from several restaurants, including one in Hadley, Massachusetts. <b>The</b> <b>charge</b> <b>was</b> continued in December to be dismissed after three months' good behavior.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Gomez {{was charged}} with murder after a gang fight outside a nightclub in Manchester. Gomez had hit one of his attackers, Sam Parle, who died after his head hit the {{pavement}} {{as a result of}} the blow. <b>The</b> <b>charge</b> <b>was</b> later reduced to manslaughter and Gomez was cleared after it was ruled that he had acted in self-defence.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} day of battle, {{fighting}} resumed on Culp's Hill, and cavalry battles raged to the east and south, but the main event was a dramatic infantry assault by 12,500 Confederates against the center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge, known as Pickett's Charge. <b>The</b> <b>charge</b> <b>was</b> repulsed by Union rifle and artillery fire, at great loss to the Confederate army.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>charger</b> for <b>the</b> Boosted Board has a 120W output that <b>charges</b> <b>the</b> {{skateboard}} up to 85% {{in half an}} hour, and 100% in an hour. <b>The</b> <b>charger</b> <b>is</b> 100-240V and 50-60 Hz, allowing <b>the</b> <b>charger</b> to <b>be</b> used {{anywhere in}} the world. Using <b>the</b> <b>charger</b> in another country may require an adapter, as <b>the</b> <b>charger</b> <b>is</b> a standard U.S. 3 prong plug.|$|R
50|$|Walker posted {{bond and}} {{returned}} home to Dallas, where he was greeted by a crowd of some two hundred supporters. After {{a federal grand jury}} adjourned in January 1963 without indicting him, <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>were</b> dropped. Because <b>the</b> dismissal of <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>was</b> without prejudice, <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> could have <b>been</b> reinstated within five years.|$|R
25|$|In general, if a {{defendant}} is found incompetent {{to proceed to}} trial, the criminal proceedings are suspended. In those cases, where <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>are</b> petty, <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>are</b> often dropped or a plea bargain may be made in which <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>are</b> nolle prossed if the defendant agrees to seek treatment. Otherwise, the defendant is usually committed to a psychiatric hospital for treatment until the defendant is restored to competency, {{at which point the}} trial will proceed.|$|R
5|$|Since the Belgian {{military}} had officially surrendered in May 1940 and the Belgian Constitution specifically forbade Belgians from joining foreign militaries, the Free Belgian forces were officially committing treason; <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>was</b> only annulled in 1948 {{and nobody was}} prosecuted. Despite the formation of all-Belgian ground units from late 1940, many Belgian volunteers – {{especially those in the}} Royal Air Force – served in majority British units, particularly in the early years after the formation of the Free Belgian forces.|$|E
5|$|The Dart Charge {{scheme was}} {{considered}} a success by the project management, who claimed it has reduced peak-time round trips over the crossing by 15 minutes. The Automobile Association said the scheme had faults, while a BBC report showed 1.8 million drivers had been fined for failure to pay {{in the year since}} <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>was</b> set up.|$|E
5|$|Between 13:00 and 14:00 General Bem amassed {{at least}} 64 {{artillery}} pieces {{on a narrow}} front near Forts 21, 22 and 23, and started firing on the artillery and infantry of the I Russian Corps. In the artillery barrage that lasted until 17:00, the forces of Russian I and II Corps were eventually forced to withdraw behind the ramparts of the captured forts. On several occasions the Russian cavalry of General Khilkov (including the Cuirassier Regiment) tried to charge the Polish artillery positions, but every time <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>was</b> bloodily repelled with grapeshot and canister shot. Eventually the Russian cavalry withdrew from battle {{all the way to}} Górce. Half of the Russian artillery fought an intense artillery duel with the Poles, while the other half started shelling the suburb of Wola and Polish positions behind the second line of defences. Although the barrage prepared the field for yet another Polish counter-attack, Krukowiecki would not risk it.|$|E

50|$|In 2014, Russia's Investigative Committee charged Ashurkov with {{embezzlement}} {{of funds}} from Alexei Navalny's 2013 mayoral campaign, {{after which he}} applied for political asylum in Great Britain, claiming <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>were</b> politically motivated. Both Ashurkov and Navalny maintain that <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>were</b> baseless.|$|R
5000|$|Charger - an Infected {{with a large}} mutated {{arm that}} attacks by {{charging}} Survivors at high speed. <b>The</b> <b>charge</b> attack <b>is</b> capable of knocking down and effectively stunning every Survivor at once, and the Survivor {{at the forefront of}} the attack is carried as far as <b>the</b> <b>Charger</b> runs or until <b>the</b> <b>Charger</b> hits a wall, at which point <b>the</b> <b>Charger</b> begins to pummel the Survivor. Survivors being pummeled are completely helpless and will <b>be</b> killed unless <b>the</b> <b>Charger</b> <b>is</b> killed. <b>The</b> <b>Charger</b> <b>is</b> also unique among the Special Infected in that, due to its hulking size, it cannot be shoved; only frag rounds and explosives can stumble a <b>charger.</b> <b>The</b> <b>charger</b> <b>is</b> also quite lethal in its standard melee attack while not charging.|$|R
5|$|The safety fougasse design had the {{advantage}} that without the propelling charge the fougasse was sufficiently safe {{that it did not}} require a guard. Banks records that installing the charge only when there was clear danger relatively close at hand was a safety feature required to protect the public from accidents. The ammonal used for the main propellant charge is a cheap industrial explosive that is notoriously hygroscopic, becoming less effective when it absorbs moisture. Even though <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>was</b> packed into a rubber bag in a tin and sealed with insulating tape, {{it would not have been}} a good idea to store it for long in the damp conditions of a flame fougasse installation.|$|E
5|$|Under the 2008 Charging Order {{introduced}} on 15 November 2008, charges between 10pm and 6am were discontinued, but standard daytime rates increased, {{starting at}} £1.50 for cars. On 7 October 2012 the charges increased to £2 for cars, £2.50 for 2 axle goods vehicles and £5 for multi-axle goods vehicles. By 2012, local businesses were {{complaining that the}} crossing's charge booths were impeding local growth. The government announced that a new electronic charging system would be introduced in 2014. Drivers {{would be able to}} pay by phone, text, online or in shops. <b>The</b> <b>charge</b> <b>was</b> proposed to increase to £2.50 for cars, £3 for two-axle goods vehicles and £6 for multi-axle vehicles. A later report stated that drivers evading the charge could be fined as much as £105.|$|E
5|$|After wasting their {{ammunition}} in {{this preliminary}} action, the Mahdist force began a flanking maneuver against the Belgians. The Mahdists' right flank, situated {{along the river}} parallel to the Nile, advanced rapidly trying to pin Chaltin {{with his back to}} the river. Chaltin, who by this time had advanced within two hundred meters of the Mahdists and begun a more effective barrage of his own, replied to the threat by ordering the sudden advance of his reserve companies. The move checked the advancing Mahdists, avoiding the unfavorable position and causing the rebels to falter. Sensing that victory was near, Chaltin ordered the Azande to charge the Mahdists to separate the advanced right wing from the rest of the line. <b>The</b> <b>charge</b> <b>was</b> successful, and the now considerably damaged Mahdist flanking force was completely cut off and surrounded by Free State soldiers. Chaltin's main companies then attacked, pressing the Mahdist defenses as they forced their way into the hills. Three of the companies attacked the well-defended path through the hills, while two others charged the hilltops. After a fierce contest for the heights, the demoralized and weakened Mahdist line broke and its remaining defenders fled to the north towards Rejaf, leaving ammunition and weapons. The action was finished by eight-thirty that morning.|$|E

50|$|In January 2010, the MCSA laid {{undisclosed}} internal {{charges against}} Verryn, {{and after a}} hearing he was suspended on 19 January 2010. The fact that <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>were</b> initially undisclosed did nothing to quell the rumours that {{the real reason for}} <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>was</b> that there was substance to the accusations which had been made. A statement was later released that the basis for <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> had <b>been</b> that Verryn had exceeded his authority.|$|R
5|$|Confident {{that the}} results of the 1795 {{election}} would be reversed, Benjamin Logan was the first to declare his candidacy for the governorship in 1799. Garrard and Thomas Todd declared their respective candidacies soon after. Former U.S. Representative Christopher Greenup also sought the office. Many of the recent settlers in Kentucky were unaware of his illustrious military record and unimpressed with his unsophisticated speaking skills. Although the candidates themselves rarely spoke negatively of each other, opponents of each candidate independently raised issues that they felt would hurt that candidate. John Breckinridge, Garrard's long-time political nemesis, tried to goad Garrard into making another impassioned plea for emancipation of slaves, which was a minority position in the state, but Garrard recognized Breckinridge's tactics and refused to express any bold emancipationist sentiments during the campaign. The fact that the slavery protections in the new constitution were even stronger than those in the previous document ensured that the incumbent's previous anti-slavery sentiments were not a major concern to most of the electorate. The family of Henry Field, a prominent leader in Frankfort, attacked Garrard for not issuing a pardon for Field, who was convicted of murdering his wife with an ax. After examining the evidence in the case, Garrard concluded that the verdict was reached justly and without undue outside influence, but <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>was</b> raised so late in the campaign that Garrard's defense of his refusal to issue a pardon could not be circulated widely.|$|E
5|$|His {{most notorious}} exploit {{took place during}} the Crimean War on 25 October 1854 when, in command of the Light Cavalry Brigade at the battle of Balaclava, he led the Charge of the Light Brigade {{reaching}} the Russian guns before returning, personally unscathed, in a manoeuvre that cost the lives of about 107 out of the 674 men under his command {{who took part in the}} charge (although others may have died of wounds later on). The extent to which Lord Cardigan was to blame is unproven, since he attacked only after expressing his doubts and receiving a direct order in front of the troops from his immediate superior Lord Lucan, Commander of the Cavalry Division. The two men were barely on speaking terms as Lucan was married to one of Cardigan's sisters and, as Cardigan believed, did not treat her well. The order had been conveyed by Captain Louis Nolan, who died in the charge, and both Lucan and Cardigan blamed him for passing on the order incorrectly. Cardigan's first action on his return from <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>was</b> to report the undisciplined behaviour of Captain Nolan (whom he did not know to be dead) in riding ahead of him at the start of the attack.|$|E
25|$|The second {{occurred}} between 6 and 11 March 1807.

5000|$|On October 22, 2007, the Holy Land Foundation trial {{ended in}} a mistrial.

[...] All defendants were convicted upon retrial in 2008.|$|R

However British casualties were heavy; of the 170 men taking part, twenty-six were killed and forty wounded. They also had 100 horses killed.|$|E
