40|$|In this chapter, {{we provide}} a formal {{definition}} <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> {{relationship with a}} strict mathematical structure that can reflect many of the commonly used notions <b>of</b> <b>trust.</b> Based on this formal definition, we propose a unified taxonomy framework <b>of</b> <b>trust.</b> Under the taxonomy framework, we discuss classification <b>of</b> <b>trust.</b> In particular, we address the base level authentication trust at the lower layer and a hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> relationships at a higher level, we provide a set of definitions, propositions, and operations based on the relations <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> relationships.

40|$|ABSTRACT Integrating the typologies <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> {{dimensions}} and trust ideal-types {{with the new}} typologies <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> forms and trust bases, I propose a geocentric framework <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> in general and <b>of</b> organizational <b>trust</b> in particular. The typology <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> forms is built on the dimension of spatial strength to address the content <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> building from weak trust to strong trust and on the dimension of temporal stage to address the process <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> building from initial trust to mature <b>trust.</b> The typology <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> bases is built on the dimension <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> sources to address the bases <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> building from depersonalized sources to personalized sources and on the dimension <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> domains to address the bases <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> building from dyad domains to network domains. Together with its three pillars (trust-building mechanisms, leadership and trust-as-choice), the central theme <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> building connects all four trust typologies toward a geocentric framework that integrates and transcends the cultural values of the East and the West. This framework bears a special implication for theorizing about transaction cost and transaction value as a duality for interorganizational alliance...|$|R
