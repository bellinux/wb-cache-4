500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Commentaries</b> had a {{particular}} influence in the United States; James Iredell, an original Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States wrote that <b>the</b> <b>Commentaries</b> were [...] "Books admirably calculated for a young Student, and indeed may instruct the most learned [...] [...] Pleasure and Instruction go hand in hand". When <b>the</b> <b>Commentaries</b> were first printed in North America, 1,400 copies were ordered for Philadelphia alone. Academics have also noted the early reliance of the Supreme Court on <b>the</b> <b>Commentaries,</b> probably {{due to a lack}} of US legal tradition at that time. The US academic Robert Ferguson notes that [...] "all our formative documents – the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Federalist Papers and the seminal decisions of the Supreme Court under John Marshall – were drafted by attorneys steeped in Sir William Blackstone's <b>Commentaries</b> on <b>the</b> Laws of England. So much was this the case that <b>the</b> <b>Commentaries</b> rank second only to the Bible as a literary and intellectual influence on the history of American institutions". Even today, <b>the</b> <b>Commentaries</b> are cited in Supreme Court decisions between 10 and 12 times a year.|$|R

Hassett was known for his disapproval of some of the aspects of the modern evolution of cricket, particularly the more aggressive player conduct that contrasted with the more sedate and gentlemanly style of his era.|$|E

In <b>the</b> <b>commentary</b> to A Vision of the Last Judgement, Blake claimed that the image originated in a particular vision he experienced that allowed him to see the host of Heaven praising God. The actual design of A Vision of the Last Judgement was created in 1808 as an expansion of his 1805 work The Day of Judgement. Blake created this work to be used in Blair's The Grave, which was published 1808.|$|E

5|$|Driven {{by early}} {{enjoyment}} of the media coverage of cricket, Agnew developed a love for playing the game. At the end of days spent watching cricket on television in a blacked-out room with <b>the</b> <b>commentary</b> provided by the radio, Agnew {{would go into the}} garden and practise his bowling for hours, trying to imitate the players he had seen. Agnew's father, an amateur cricketer, taught him the rudiments of the sport, including an offspin action, as he wanted his son to develop into a bowler like him. Another family connection to cricket was his first cousin, Mary Duggan, who was a women's Test player for England from 1948 to 1963.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} edition, {{published}} in 1539, Calvin dropped this format {{in favour of}} systematically presenting the main doctrines from the Bible. In the process, the book was enlarged from six chapters to seventeen. He concurrently worked on another book, <b>the</b> <b>Commentary</b> on Romans, {{which was published in}} March 1540. The book was a model for his later commentaries: it included his own Latin translation from the Greek rather than the Latin Vulgate, an exegesis, and an exposition. In the dedicatory letter, Calvin praised the work of his predecessors Philipp Melanchthon, Heinrich Bullinger, and Martin Bucer, but he also took care to distinguish his own work from theirs and to criticise some of their shortcomings.|$|E

His epistles on 1 and 2 Corinthians, however, dedicated to Theodemir, abbot of Psalmody, and a possible student of his, were sent to Aachen by the dedicatee to be condemned by the assembled bishops of the realm. The Corinthian commentaries were unpublished, though it was these commentaries that sparked the controversy concerning icons and pilgrimages.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to a showcase for visual improvements, Lost Coast acted as a testbed for Valve's commentary system.

Players hear the developers {{talk about what the}} player is seeing, what is happening, why they made certain decisions, and what kinds of challenges they faced. Commentary tracks are represented by floating speech bubbles called commentary nodes.

500|$|Blackstone's primary {{legacy is}} his written work, {{specifically}} <b>the</b> <b>Commentaries</b> on <b>the</b> Laws of England. Demand for reprinted, abridged and translated versions was [...] "almost inexhaustible" [...] in the 18th and 19th centuries, although <b>the</b> <b>Commentaries</b> emphasis on <b>the</b> sovereignty of Parliament drew ire. Alexis de Tocqueville described Blackstone as [...] "an inferior writer, without liberality of mind or depth of judgment". Other commentators differ; one {{described him as}} [...] "the core element in the British Enlightenment", comparing him to Montesquieu, Beccaria and Voltaire. Academics have said that <b>the</b> <b>Commentaries</b> were crucial in changing English Law from a system based on actions {{to a system of}} substantive law. At the time of publication, the common law of England was still, in some ways, in its infancy, with people uncertain as to what the law was. <b>The</b> <b>Commentaries</b> helped to solidify legal thinking. At the same time, legal education had stalled, and Blackstone's work gave the Law [...] "at least a veneer of scholarly respectability".
