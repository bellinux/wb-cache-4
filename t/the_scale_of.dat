5|$|A {{large number}} of {{soldiers}} {{who died in the}} war were never found, and similarly bodies were recovered that could not be identified; once again, this required new forms of memorial. <b>The</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> the issue was once again huge: 73,000 Allied dead were never found at the Somme, for example, either because their bodies had been lost, destroyed or were unrecognisable, more than one in ten of the losses in the battle.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, John Maynard Smith, a noted {{biologist}} with {{a strong}} background in aeronautics, {{has pointed out that}} bumblebees would not be expected to sustain flight, as they would need to generate too much power given their tiny wing area. However, in aerodynamics experiments with other insects, he found that viscosity at <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> small insects meant even their small wings can move a very large volume of air relative to their size, and this reduces the power required to sustain flight by an order of magnitude.|$|E

30|$|Finally, we {{prove that}} <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> choice <b>of</b> Q[*]=[*]Θ(log 2 (ρ)) is order-optimal. First, {{we show that}} no scaling order larger than this results in higher throughput. We have {{observed}} that by <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> Q[*]=[*]Θ(log 2 (ρ)), <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> R 1 is as R 1 [*]=[*]Θ(log 2 (ρ)). Choosing a larger scaling than Q[*]=[*]Θ(log 2 (ρ)) for Q, does not help improving <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> order <b>of</b> R 1. That is because R 1 [*]=[*]Θ(log 2 (ρ)) is <b>the</b> best achievable <b>scaling</b> even in <b>the</b> case of Q[*]=[*]∞. Thus, increasing <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> order <b>of</b> Q does not help improving <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> order <b>of</b> R 1. On the other hand, this action will deteriorate the pre-constant factor by increasing the third phase load. Consequently, no scaling larger than Θ(log 2 (ρ)) is <b>the</b> optimum <b>scaling</b> order.|$|R
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> {{the damage}} became clear, the {{government}} of Yemen requested for assistance from the international community. The hardest hit areas had poor infrastructure, which caused difficulties in communications as relief goods were distributed. Nations in the region, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, sent money and supplies to help rebuild the damaged infrastructure and houses. Agencies under the United Nations provided food and logistical support. Relief efforts continued to make progress until 2011 due to a political uprising in Yemen.|$|E

40|$|Effects of size are {{pervasive}} and affect nearly {{all aspects of}} the biology of animals and plants. Theoretical scaling models have been developed to predict the effects of size on the functioning of musculo-skeletal systems. Although numerous experimental studies have investigated the effects of size on the movements of skeletal elements during locomotion and feeding in vertebrates, relatively little is known about <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> muscles and bones responsible for the actual movements. Here, we examine <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> external morphology, skeletal elements of the feeding system, and a number of cranial muscles to understand how this may affect the movements observed during suction feeding in the African catfish, Clarias gariepinus. The results show that neither the head nor the cranial elements themselves scale according to geometric similarity models. Relative to head size, distinct changes in the mass and configuration of the feeding structures takes place. Unexpectedly, different cranial muscles show different scaling patterns that ultimately all lead to a positive allometry of muscle cross-sectional area relative to fish head size. This suggests that (1) <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cranial elements cannot be predicted a priori based on <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> external head dimensions and (2) <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feeding system is optimised towards high force output in the larger animals. An analysis of the consequences of the observed changes in morphology with size on performance traits, including bite force and jaw closing velocity, suggests a tight link between <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feeding system and the natural diet of these fish. Whereas for smaller size classes the system is tuned towards high bite forces, for animals with cranial lengths greater than 65 mm <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feeding system appears to be dictated by the hydrodynamic constraints on suction feeding...|$|R

40|$|We study <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{decoherence}} {{factor of}} a qubit (spin- 1 / 2) using the central spin {{model in which}} the central spin (qubit) is globally coupled to a transverse XY spin chain. The aim here is to study the non-equilibrium generation of decoherence when the spin chain is driven across (along) quantum critical points (lines) and derive <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decoherence factor {{in terms of the}} driving rate and some of the exponents associated with the quantum critical points. Our studies show that <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> logarithm of decoherence factor is identical to that of the defect density in the final state of the spin chain following a quench across isolated quantum critical points for both linear and non-linear variations of a parameter even if the defect density may not satisfy <b>the</b> standard Kibble-Zurek <b>scaling.</b> However, one finds an interesting deviation when the spin chain is driven along a critical line.
