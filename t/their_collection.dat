Alexandria von Bromssen, Justin LeBlanc and Helen Castillo, the bottom 3 of the last challenge, had to show the three best pieces from <b>their</b> <b>collections</b> to the judges. In a final twist, both von Bromssen and LeBlanc {{were chosen to}} show <b>their</b> <b>collections</b> at Fashion Week, making this the fourth time four people were competing in the finale.|$|R

5|$|A {{large number}} of civic or {{municipal}} botanical gardens were founded in the 19th and 20th centuries. These did not develop scientific facilities or programmes, but the horticultural aspects were strong and the plants often labelled. They were botanical gardens {{in the sense of}} building up collections of plants and exchanging seeds with other gardens around the world, although <b>their</b> <b>collection</b> policies were determined by those in day-to-day charge of them. They tended to become little more than beautifully maintained parks and were, indeed, often under general parks administrations.|$|E
5|$|As cheap {{reproductions of}} Hope, and from 1908 {{high-quality}} prints, began to circulate in large quantities, {{it became a}} widely popular image. President Theodore Roosevelt displayed a copy at his Sagamore Hill home in New York; reproductions circulated worldwide; and a 1922 film depicted Watts's creation of the painting and an imagined story behind it. By this time Hope was coming to seem outdated and sentimental, and Watts was rapidly falling out of fashion. In 1938 the Tate Gallery ceased to keep <b>their</b> <b>collection</b> of Watts's works on permanent display.|$|E

40|$|Collecting is a {{fascinating}} area of human experience. Collections are used to express the collector’s knowledge and experience, as well as reveal their extended identity. The emergence of computing systems creates good opportunities for collectors to significantly {{increase the number of}} people they can share <b>their</b> <b>collections</b> with. Surprisingly, few tools exist that support the process of displaying and organizing collections and the stories they hold. This project is about discovering how collectors could further construct <b>their</b> <b>collections</b> in a virtualized version to preserve the rich experience behind <b>their</b> <b>collections,</b> share more knowledge and beauty with people, and present an image of their self in terms of <b>their</b> <b>collections.</b> A website is designed which allows collectors to track long-term collecting activities, create relevant metadata online, discover internal connections between items or sets, and share more information with a larger audience...|$|R

5|$|Edwards {{was drawn}} to the theater early in life, and he {{appeared}} in amateur productions in London. After sailing to Australia, Edwards appeared professionally in Shakespearean plays and light comedies primarily in Melbourne and Sydney. Throughout his childhood in England and his acting career in Australia, he was greatly interested in collecting insects, and the National Museum of Victoria used the results of his Australian fieldwork as part of the genesis of <b>their</b> <b>collection.</b>|$|E
5|$|Flare: The {{earliest}} recorded use of gunpowder for signalling purposes was the 'signal bomb' {{used by the}} Song Dynasty Chinese as the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty besieged Yangzhou in 1276. These soft-shelled bombs, {{timed to}} explode in mid-air, were used to send messages to a detachment of troops far in the distance. Another mention of the signal bomb appears in a text dating from 1293 requesting <b>their</b> <b>collection</b> from those still stored in Zhejiang. A signal gun appears in Korea by 1600. The Wu I Thu Phu Thung Chih or Illustrated Military Encyclopedia written in 1791 depicts a signal gun in an illustration.|$|E

5|$|Sea anemones {{and their}} {{attendant}} anemone fish can make attractive aquarium exhibits {{and both are}} often harvested from the wild as adults or juveniles. These fishing activities significantly impact the populations of anemones and anemone fish by drastically reducing the densities of each in exploited areas. Besides <b>their</b> <b>collection</b> from the wild for use in reef aquaria, sea anemones are also threatened by alterations to their environment. Those living in shallow water coastal locations are affected directly by pollution and siltation, and indirectly by the effect these have on their photosynthetic symbionts and the prey on which they feed.|$|E
5|$|The College of William and Mary in Virginia holds {{some of his}} papers. A {{selection}} of his letters was published in 1944 under the title A Selection of the Letters of Fairfax Harrison. The University of Virginia library has on loan another collection of Harrison's papers. Correspondence and business files from his time {{as president of the}} Southern Railway are held by the Southern Railway Historical Society in <b>their</b> <b>collection</b> of president's files. They were loaned to the Southern Museum of Civil War and Locomotive History in 2003 and were still there in 2008.|$|E
5|$|British Airways retired its Concorde fleet on 24 October 2003. G-BOAG left New York to a fanfare {{similar to}} that given for Air France's F-BTSD, while two more made round trips, G-BOAF over the Bay of Biscay, {{carrying}} VIP guests including former Concorde pilots, and G-BOAE to Edinburgh. The three aircraft then circled over London, having received special permission to fly at low altitude, before landing in sequence at Heathrow. The captain of the New York to London flight was Mike Bannister. The final flight of a Concorde in the US occurred on 5 November 2003 when G-BOAG flew from New York's JFK Airport to Seattle's Boeing Field to join the Museum of Flight's permanent collection. The plane was piloted by Mike Bannister and Les Broadie, who claimed a flight time of three hours, 55 minutes and 12 seconds, a record between the two cities. The museum had been pursuing a Concorde for <b>their</b> <b>collection</b> since 1984. The final flight of a Concorde worldwide took place on 26 November 2003 with a landing at Filton, Bristol, UK.|$|E

5|$|In 1922 the American film Hope, {{directed}} by Legaren à Hiller and starring Mary Astor and Ralph Faulkner, {{was based on}} the imagined origins of the painting. In it Joan, a fisherman's wife, is treated poorly by the rest of her village in her husband's absence, and has only the hope of his return to cling to. His ship returns but bursts into flames, before he is washed up safe and well on shore. The story is interspersed with scenes of Watts explaining the story to a model, and with stills of the painting. By the time the film was released, the fad for prints of Hope was long over, to the extent that references to it had become verbal shorthand for authors and artists wanting to indicate that a scene was set in the 1900s–1910s. Watts's reputation continued to fade as artistic tastes changed, and in 1938 the Tate Gallery removed <b>their</b> <b>collection</b> of Watts's works from permanent display.|$|E
5|$|In autumn 1943, Hergé {{decided that}} he wanted Edgar P. Jacobs, a fellow cartoonist, to {{collaborate}} with him on The Adventures of Tintin. Although initially hesitant, Jacobs eventually agreed, adopting the paid position in January 1944. The two became close friends and artistic collaborators, with Jacobs aiding him in developing {{various aspects of the}} plot, for instance developing the idea of the crystal balls and the story's title. Although stylistically they were different both in forms of illustration and narrative, they influenced each other greatly. He used Jacobs as a life model from whom he drew various poses that characters adopt in the story. He also used Jacobs as a researcher, sending him to the Cinquantenaire Museum to study its collections of Incan material, and it was the mummified Incan corpse in <b>their</b> <b>collection</b> that was used {{as the basis for the}} mummy of Rascar Capac.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2005 Barrales {{began looking}} for musicians for the band, asking friends of his {{to see if they}} could {{recommend}} anyone, which is how he heard of guitarist Alex Lee. When Barrales saw Lee play, he dropped the thought of trying to play rhythm guitar himself because he had a fear of not being able to keep up. There were a few years that Lee was playing guitar, but he was already playing along to music by Steve Vai, John Petrucci, Rusty Cooley, Paul Gilbert and Michael Angelo Batio. Lee decided to join Barrales, and together, they went on searching until they found themselves the drummer Carlos Regalado, who was known locally by playing covers of Megadeth and Metallica. With Regalado in the band, he helped to find bassist Ruben Dominguez. The band was impressed with the skills of Dominguez, who soon joined the band completing its line-up. The band then decided to name themselves after Exodus' Bonded by Blood, an album they had in common in <b>their</b> <b>collection,</b> even though their music tastes differed.|$|E

5|$|On their {{donation}} to the South Kensington Museum, the nine works donated by Watts were hung on the staircase leading to the library, but Hope proved a popular loan to other institutions {{as a symbol of}} current British art. At the Royal Jubilee Exhibition of 1887 in Manchester, an entire wall was dedicated to the works of Watts. Hope, only recently completed but already the most famous of Watts's works, was placed at the centre of this display. It was then exhibited at the 1888 Melbourne Centennial Exhibition and the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris, before being moved to Munich for display at the Glaspalast. In 1897 {{it was one of the}} 17 Watts works transferred to the newly created National Gallery of British Art (commonly known as the Tate Gallery, now Tate Britain); at the time, Watts was so highly regarded that an entire room of the new museum was dedicated to his works. The Tate Gallery considered Hope one of the highlights of <b>their</b> <b>collection</b> and did not continue the South Kensington Museum's practice of lending the piece to overseas exhibitions.|$|E
5|$|The 5th Marquess of Bute, another John, {{succeeded in}} 1947 and, in 1950, {{he placed the}} castle {{in the care of}} the Ministry of Works. The Marquess also {{disposed}} of Cardiff Castle, which he gave to the city, removing the family portraits from the castle before doing so. In turn, the paintings in Castell Coch were removed by the ministry and sent to Cardiff, the National Museum of Wales providing alternatives from <b>their</b> <b>collection</b> for Castell Coch. Academic interest in the property grew, with publications in the 1950s and 1960s exploring its artistic and architectural value. Since 1984, the property has been administered by Cadw, an agency of the Welsh Government, and is open to the public; it received 69,466 visitors in 2011. The castle has also been used as a location for filming.|$|E
5|$|The {{children}} liked animals, {{and their}} menagerie included dogs, cats, birds, raccoons, opossums, rabbits, a Shetland pony and a parrot. The children once used their animals {{to conduct a}} circus {{on the grounds of}} the Governor's Mansion. Hogg charged each visitor five cents, but was forced to return the money when her father discovered the scheme. In later years, the family added a bear, a horse, a fawn, cockatoos, and two ostriches named Jack and Jill to <b>their</b> <b>collection</b> of animals. In response to a challenge from her brothers, Hogg once mounted one of the ostriches, but was thrown from its back after one of the boys hit it with a slingshot. Ima and her ostriches later became the protagonists of a picture book, Ima & the Great Texas Ostrich Race, by Margaret Olivia McManis and Bruce Dupree.|$|E
