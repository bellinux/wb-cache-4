500|$|In an {{analysis}} of how the show has changed throughout its run, Channel Frederator argued that the main characters of SpongeBob–specifically Sandy, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, Squidward and Karen–have been reduced from multidimensional to reliant on single traits. According to this view, [...] "Karen is now a full-blown nag" [...] in newer episodes. This aspect of Karen's character has also been criticized by author Joseph J. Foy, in his book SpongeBob SquarePants and Philosophy. He considers this trope one of several harmful stereotypes present on the program, writing that [...] "the motif of <b>the</b> <b>nagging</b> wife is certainly an issue worthy of dissection in dealing with a young audience, along with the spoiled teen daughter [...] and the stupid best friend [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth {{appeared}} to be a composite of two personages found in the account of King Duff and in the account of King Duncan in Holinshed's Chronicles (1587). In the account of King Duff, one of his captains, Donwald, suffers the deaths of his kinsmen at the orders of the king. Donwald then considers regicide at [...] "the setting on of his wife", who [...] "showed him the means whereby he might soonest accomplish it." [...] Donwald abhors such an act, but perseveres at <b>the</b> <b>nagging</b> of his wife. After plying the king's servants with food and drink and letting them fall asleep, the couple admit their confederates to the king's room, where they then commit the regicide. The murder of Duff has its motivation in revenge rather than ambition.|$|E

500|$|The seventh season {{received}} moderately positive {{reviews from}} critics, although increasingly critical reviews were more common this season. While critics enjoyed {{many of the}} episodes, many also felt that, as a whole, the season was the weakest of the show's original seven. Eric Mink of the New York Daily News praised the season, noting that it was [...] "proof that The X-Files still has more than enough creative life in it to justify an eighth season". He called many of the stand-alone episodes [...] "wonderfully creepy" [...] and noted that the season possessed a [...] "terrific bunch of episodes". Thomas Doherty from Cinefantastique gave the season a mixed review and noted that the series was hurt by the partnership between Mulder and Scully [...] "settl into the comfortable groove of a modern two career marriage—supportive, professionally rewarding, and utterly sexless." [...] Further, he noted that [...] "the most entertaining episode lately have been the self parodies, where killer cockroaches scurry and living dead roam, or where (in the Duchovny written and directed episode) Scully and Mulder are played by Téa Leoni and Garry Shandling in a motion picture only slightly more ludicrous than a 1998 motion picture called The X-Files." [...] Doherty argued that the [...] "self-parody" [...] style of the series caused viewers to not take it seriously anymore, explaining that, [...] "No longer going for the big chill, Carter and company are winking at their audience, as if to say: even we can't pretend to believe in this muddled mishmash anymore." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files, was positive towards {{the first half of}} the season, but soon saw the episodes in more of a negative light. He wrote, [...] "A season that began with such hope ended with a sense of sorrow given the end result of the season-long backstage wheeling and dealing [...] Not even the magnificent season finale [...] could erase <b>the</b> <b>nagging</b> doubts I had that a series that had been so amazing for so long would soon embark upon a new course wrought with pitfalls and turmoil." [...] The A.V. Club noted that while the first eight seasons of The X-Files were [...] "good-to-great", the seventh season of the show was [...] "flagging" [...] and possessed [...] "significant problems.|$|E

However, he criticized the difficulty spike, the lack of characterisation, {{as well as the}} linear mission design of the story campaign, which he stated [...] "the disappointing mission design contributes to <b>the</b> <b>nagging</b> sense that you’d rather be out hitting the restless dead with pipes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{writes that}} McCartney {{possesses}} [...] "an endearingly ragged, homemade quality", with [...] "That Would Be Something", [...] "Every Night", [...] "Teddy Boy" [...] and [...] "Maybe I'm Amazed" [...] all [...] "full-fledged McCartney classics". Although {{he notes that}} [...] "the throwaway nature {{of much of the}} material ... has become charming in retrospect", Erlewine adds: [...] "Unfortunately, in retrospect it also appears as a harbinger of <b>the</b> <b>nagging</b> mediocrity that would plague McCartney's entire solo career." [...] Record Collector has highlighted [...] "Every Night", [...] "Junk" [...] and [...] "Maybe I'm Amazed" [...] as songs that [...] "still sound absolutely effortless and demonstrate the man's natural genius with a melody".|$|E

2500|$|Flood, the sessions' engineer, was unconvinced by the song's mix, {{saying he}} [...] "was <b>the</b> <b>nagging</b> doubter.

[...] The final mix was {{completed}} at Windmill Lane Studios in September 1991 on the last night of the album's recording sessions, when some last minute additions were made. Bono did not like a line in the vocals and spent most of the day re-recording it. Later, after the song's mix had just been completed by the production team, the Edge came up with a guitar part he wanted to add to the song's end near the lyric [...] "Love is a temple".

2500|$|Carl {{concludes that}} as of the 2010s, the {{interest}} in Brian's life comes primarily from [...] "the human-interest angle" [...] rather than a musical one, [...] " [...] plays into the popular tendency to fetishise any overlap between genius and madness, which seems at once like a denial of the commonness of mental illness {{and a way to}} channel our envy of the gifted. [...] there is <b>the</b> <b>nagging</b> desire, whether exploitative or well-meant, to push the one-time prodigy to produce again, to squeeze out one last masterpiece. These factors all distort both Wilson’s story and his significance." [...] In 2011, after speaking to some of Wilson's close acquaintances, biographer Jon Stebbins speculated that [...] "Working in the studio and especially touring is not really his choice. His handlers, managers, and wife insist that he work. It's all a bit Landy-like when you look behind the curtain." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{wanted to}} be affectionate to this sister, who was good, and who, in her way, he knew, loved him. But, somehow, she grew less herself {{as the years went}} by, and more and more baffling.

60|$|Here then, {{we have in}} vivisection, as in all {{the other}} tolerated and instituted cruelties, this anti-climax: that only a {{negligible}} percentage of those who practise and consequently defend it get any satisfaction out of it. As in Mr. Galsworthy's play Justice the useless and detestable torture of solitary imprisonment is shown at its worst without {{the introduction of a}} single cruel person into the drama, so {{it would be possible to}} represent all the torments of vivisection dramatically without introducing a single vivisector who had not felt sick at his first experience in the laboratory. Not that this can exonerate any vivisector from suspicion of enjoying his work (or her work: a good deal of the vivisection in medical schools is done by women). In every autobiography which records a real experience of school or prison life, we find that here and there among the routineers there is to be found the genuine amateur, the orgiastic flogging schoolmaster or <b>the</b> <b>nagging</b> warder, who has sought out a cruel profession for the sake of its cruelty. But it is the genuine routineer who is the bulwark of the practice, because, though you can excite public fury against a Sade, a Bluebeard, or a Nero, you cannot rouse any feeling against dull Mr. Smith doing his duty: that is, doing the usual thing. He is so obviously no better and no worse than anyone else that it is difficult to conceive that the things he does are abominable. If you would see public dislike surging up in a moment against an individual, you must watch one who does something unusual, no matter how sensible it may be. The name of Jonas Hanway lives as that of a brave man because he was the first who dared to appear in the streets of this rainy island with an umbrella.|$|E

60|$|The {{first act}} {{revealed}} the stern and heroic Communist maintaining his views despite the reproaches of {{father and mother}} and <b>the</b> <b>nagging</b> of his wife. It showed also the Anarchist brother (as might be expected from the Bolshevik hostility to Anarchism) as an unruly, lazy, ne'er-do-well, with a passionate love for Sonia, the young bourgeoise, which was likely to become dangerous if not returned. She, on the other hand, obviously preferred the Communist. It {{was clear that he}} returned her love, but it was not quite clear that he would wish the relation to be anything more than platonic comradeship in the service of their common ideal. An unsuccessful strike, bringing want and danger from the police, together with increasing jealousy {{on the part of the}} Anarchist, led up to the tragic dénouement. I was not quite definite as to how this was brought about. All violent action was performed off the stage, and this made the plot at times difficult to follow. But it seemed that the Anarchist in a jealous rage forged a letter from his brother to bring Sonia to a rendezvous, and there murdered her, at the same time betraying his brother to the police. When the latter came to effect his arrest, and accuse him also, as the most likely person, of the murder, the Anarchist was seized with remorse and confessed. Both were therefore led away together. Once the plot is sketched, the play calls for no comment. It had not great merit, though it is unwise to hazard a judgment on a play whose dialogue was not fully interpreted, but it was certainly real, and the link between audience and performers was established as it never seemed to be in the professional theatre. After the performance, the floor was cleared for dancing, and the audience were in a mood of thorough enjoyment.|$|E
6000|$|His {{brilliant}} prospects dated {{from the}} death of his brother, who had no children, had indeed steadily refused to marry. When I say brilliant prospects, I mean the vision of the baronetcy, one of the oldest in England, of a charming seventeenth-century house, with its park, in Dorsetshire, and a property worth some twenty thousand a year. Such a collection of items is still dazzling to me, even after what you would call, I suppose, a familiarity with British grandeur. My husband is n't a baronet (or we probably should n't be in London in December), and he is far, alas, from having twenty thousand a year. The full enjoyment of these luxuries, on Ambrose Tester's part, was dependent naturally, on {{the death of his}} father, who was still very much to the fore at the time I first knew the young man. The proof of it is the way he kept nagging at his sons, as the younger used to say, on the question of taking a wife. <b>The</b> <b>nagging</b> had been of no avail, as I have mentioned, with regard to Francis, the elder, whose affections were centred (his brother himself told me) on the winecup and the faro-table. He was not an exemplary or edifying character, and as the heir to an honorable name and a fine estate was very unsatisfactory indeed. It had been possible in those days to put him into the army, but {{it was not possible to}} keep him there; and he was still a very young man when it became plain that any parental dream of a [...] "career" [...] for Frank Tester was exceedingly vain. Old Sir Edmund had thought matrimony would perhaps correct him, but a sterner process than this was needed, and it came to him one day at Monaco--he was most of the time abroad--after an illness so short that none of the family arrived in time. He was reformed altogether, he was utterly abolished.|$|E
