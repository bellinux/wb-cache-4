5|$|In mammals {{there are}} two types of {{immunoglobulin}} light chain, which are called lambda (λ) and kappa (κ). A light chain has two successive domains: one constant domain and one variable domain. The approximate length of a light chain is 211 to 217 amino acids. Each antibody contains two light chains <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>always</b> identical; only one type of light chain, κ or λ, is present per antibody in mammals. Other types of light chains, such as the iota (ι) chain, are found in other vertebrates like sharks (Chondrichthyes) and bony fishes (Teleostei).|$|E
5|$|In 1909, {{dermatologist}} Frederick Parkes Weber {{wrote an}} article about von Recklinghausen disease in the British Journal of Dermatology. erroneously citing Merrick {{as an example of}} the disease, which German pathologist Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen had described in 1882, but in the last year has been found that this conjecture was wrong. In fact, symptoms <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>always</b> present in this genetic disorder include tumours of the nervous tissue and bones, small warty growths on the skin, and (which is a peculiar characteristic of this disease) the presence of light brown pigmentation on the skin called café au lait spots.; however, these spots were never observed on Merrick's body. For this reason, although this diagnosis was quite popular through most of the 20th century, other conjectural diagnosis were advanced, such as those of who suffer Maffucci syndrome and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (Albright's disease).|$|E
5|$|This view of {{language}} {{is associated with}} the study {{of language}} in pragmatic, cognitive, and interactive frameworks, as well as in sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. Functionalist theories tend to study grammar as dynamic phenomena, as structures <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>always</b> in the process of changing as they are employed by their speakers. This view places importance on the study of linguistic typology, or the classification of languages according to structural features, as it can be shown that processes of grammaticalization tend to follow trajectories that are partly dependent on typology. In the philosophy of language, the view of pragmatics as being central to language and meaning is often associated with Wittgenstein's later works and with ordinary language philosophers such as J. L. Austin, Paul Grice, John Searle, and W. O. Quine.|$|E

25|$|The work of Raymond Williams {{and other}} members of the Birmingham Center for British Cultural Studies would further extend the notion of {{mediation}} in cultural materialism.

Another suit was brought against {{journalist}} Stephane Baillargeon for {{writing in the}} Montreal daily Le Devoir that the Raëlians defended pedophiles and that certain ex-Raëlians claimed the [...] "gourou" [...] liked very young girls. After some negotiation, Le Devoir published a letter from Raël condemning the charge as [...] "ignominious defamation" [...] and asserting that the Raëlian Movement had [...] "always condemned pedophilia and promoted respect for laws that justly forbid the practices <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>always</b> the fault of unbalanced individuals".|$|E

[...] Due to all the special effects needed for the episode, the episode nearly drastically went over budget. In order to not over-spend, the production crew lent various virtual game layouts from video game companies. Not wishing to simply [...] "copy existing designs," [...] production designer Corey Kaplan and his design team created [...] "some pretty pictures" [...] to differentiate the crews' design from the video game companies'.

500|$|Tonight is {{a concept}} album that explores the highs and lows {{associated}} with an evening of debauchery, as stated by a critic on online publication Ventvox.

The line [...] "come on, let's get high" [...] from [...] "Ulysses", the album's first track, reveals this theme. The album has been influenced by non-British music. It has been inspired by the [...] "heavy dub sound of Jamaican reggae stars" [...] and has [...] "the heavy bass and space echo you would find on a dub mix." [...] The album also has somewhat of an African influence. Alex Kapranos stated in an XFM article that [...] "We're one of these bands <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>always</b> gonna sound the same {{no matter what we}} do, but there are other influences there.

Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad opined he was not thrilled with Jenna's plot, observing that it was [...] "kinda ridiculous (and unfunny, which is the worse sin)." [...] Sassone, however, said that Liz and Tracy feuding and Jack and his mother battling [...] "are plots <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>always</b> good for some laughs." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger wrote that while [...] "The Natural Order" [...] was not a [...] "classic episode" [...] it was still [...] "solid enough, in the end." [...] Sepinwall enjoyed Jack and his mother's story, but commented that the Liz and Tracy rivalry was a [...] "hit-or-miss." [...] TV Guides Bruce Fretts said this episode [...] "is easily the show's most grounded episode ever, even if it does feature a gibbon in a mariachi suit. The script dares to deal with issues of race and gender from a typically irreverent perspective." [...] Fretts noted that Elaine Stritch and Alec Baldwin [...] "share a surprisingly tender scene as Colleen tells her son, 'You're my good boy I just love you to death.'" ...|$|E
