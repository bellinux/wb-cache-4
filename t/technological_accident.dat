30|$|A natural {{disaster}} triggered <b>technological</b> <b>accident</b> (Natech accident) was first defined by Showalter and Myers (1992) when they reviewed {{the causes of}} chemical accidents triggered by natural hazard events. Natechs triggered by several natural hazards have been studied including by earthquakes (Lindell and Perry 1997), hurricanes (Cruz and Krausmann 2008), floods (Cozzani et al. 2010), lightening (Krausmann et al. 2011), and tsunami (Krausmann and Cruz 2013). Natech accidents, which make up about 3 % of all reported hazmat releases between 1990 and 2008 in the United States, were reported {{as the cause of}} a small fraction of human impacts in the country (Sengul et al. 2012). In the European Union, Krausmann and Baranzini (2012) have also studied and reported on Natech accidents.

Lessons learned from these accidents contributedsignificantly to the development of technological safety in two ways: technological and legislative. Afterthree years from the adherence of Romania to EU, a coherent legislation for land-use planning is stillmissing in the context of Article 12 of Seveso Directive.

40|$|International audienceIntroductionChemical {{accidents}} {{triggered by}} natural hazards (known as Natechs) are relatively rare. Nonetheless, several {{studies indicate that}} the frequency of Natech accidents is increasing. Moreover, the industrial sector is often unprepared for these joint natural and technological or Natech events {{mainly because of the}} lack of guidelines on how to apply Natech regulations and the lack of information on the dynamics of Natechs. This article describes research works to improve the understanding of the physical and organizational vulnerability of industrial facilities exposed to natural hazards (particularly tsunamis and floods). MethodThe work is based on a posteriori (in Japan and France) and a priori analysis of the industrial as well as the local governments’ emergency management to the Natech accidents during the Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami (GEJET) and during severe flooding events in France. Survey questionnaires in Japan and France are applied to chemical facilities, to government agencies, and to citizens in France and Japan. Secondly, all of these data have been used to construct various models (systemic model, functional representation, and risk models) at the scale of the industrial site territory. These models help to represent the impact of the flood events on the facilities and more precisely on the equipment directly or indirectly involved in the development and management of a <b>technological</b> <b>accident</b> (using fault trees). ResultsThe interviews, field visits and mail survey to affected facilities have provided detailed information about losses and damage, chemical accidents and oil spills triggered by the earthquake and tsunami, the vulnerability of the facilities, the performance of safety and mitigation measures, the accident consequences, and the overall emergency response actions. 6 equipment families or subsystems directly or indirectly involved in a Natech accident have been identified. An analysis (using systemic and functionnal models) of each 6 sub-systems of the industrial installation was done in order to find how they can be impacted by flood. The final result of this work involves the development of generic accident scenarios and fault trees for flood related Natechs for each subsystem. These fault trees are then used for the development of two decision aid tools :a flood-induced Natech vulnerability assessment toolan assessment tool for the performance of industrial hazardous materials release emergency operations plans during a flood Natech eventThese two tools are currently being tested on industrial sites in France...|$|E

The influence of natural events on the technosphere is stronger in the South of the Eu-ropean Russia and in the Russian Far East, which are more exposed to hurricanes, snowstorms, rainfalls, icing and other natural hazards producing NTA.

40|$|The Seveso {{accidents}} {{and the subsequent}} european regulations raised the attention to the land use planning around major risk installations. In the last decades, moreover, {{the problem of the}} <b>technological</b> <b>accidents</b> induced by natural disruptive events (Na-tech) acquired an increasing relevance; although several methodologies to assess this kind of risk were developed, their adoption is still not explicitly requested in the regulations, neither related to major risk installations. The Na-tech related methodologies developed so far are mainly devoted to the control of risk from the plant and equipment point of view, while they don't take into account the mutual influence of natural and anthropic impacts on a territory.

40|$|Territorial {{systems have}} often to face {{more than one}} hazard. In these cases, aiming at safer communities, a multi-risk {{assessment}} is required. The need {{to take into account}} in land use planning all the hazard factors an area is prone to has been declared since the early ‘ 80 s. Nevertheless, the all-hazard approach has been often reduced to the “overlapping” of individual hazard maps: this can effectively support the singling out of “critical areas”, prone to more than one hazard, but it is generally ineffective to describe the complex interactions among different hazards and their impacts. Complex hazardous events could depend both on the spatial coincidence of individual hazards, which may occur separately in time, and on interactions among different hazards, which occur simultaneously or in strict connection. Namely, this kind of events could be composed by linked natural hazards or technological accidents triggered by natural hazards. The scientific community is paying increasing attention to these latter, the so-called na-tech events (Showalters and Myers 1992). This work focuses on na-tech events suggesting a methodology to “understand” and, consequently, to prevent and mitigate them. A more in-depth attention will be paid on technological accidents triggered by earthquakes, such as major accidents (as defined in the European Commission Directive 96 / 82 /EC) and interruptions of lifelines systems. The earthquake occurred in the Turkish Kocaeli industrial region, in 1999, {{is one of the most}} documented na-tech event. This accident clearly highlights that, in case of linked hazards, interactions among them modify the coping capacity of the hit area. This complexity could not be faced just “overlapping” individual risk maps and so undervaluing the vulnerability, and consequently overvaluing the resilience, of the exposed area. Many are the differences between facing a single hazard and a na-tech. First of all, as stated in many studies (Lindell and Perry 1996; Cruz 2005), facing at the same time a natural disaster and a technological emergency requires more resources and a specific training for emergency personnel. Besides that, it is probable to have shortage of utilities (interruption of water, power and communication supply) and lack of personnel and infrastructure. Moreover, technological accidents that could be triggered by a natural event are usually more than one, as it normally happens in case of a major accident in ordinary time, and, besides that, they could probably be much more different than a “ordinary” major accident for magnitude, typology and triggering point. Hence, to be efficacious and to represent an effective supporting tool for the definition of mitigation actions, especially at local scale, multi-risk and, in detail, na-tech risk assessment have to cope with synergies among hazard factors and their complex impacts, taking into account possible chains of hazardous events and their effects on the vulnerability of exposed areas. Nevertheless, up to now, natural and technological hazards have been mainly faced separately and no methodologies are available to face na-techs, which represent one of the most spreading complex hazardous event. As Menoni states (2005), urban planners could contribute to understand disasters with their attitude to consider more systems at the same time and to look at their mutual relationships. Nevertheless, they have the capacity to deal with systems, relations and objects evolving tridimensionally in the space. This skill is more needed if dealing with complex disasters, and, namely, with na-techs, where environmental, physical, functional and social systems are closely connected in chains of failures and damages. Basing on a systemic approach, this paper provides a methodology to analyze na-tech risk and to define urbanistic mitigation strategies against na-tech events. A method both for provincial and local scale has been defined. In detail, the “overlapping” of natural and technological risk factors maps is adopted to quickly single out the most critical areas on a provincial scale. A multi attribute decision making method is applied to rank each municipality of the investigated province, according to attributes referred to their exposure, vulnerability and hazard features. At local scale, a scenario setting method is worked out in order to forecast the possible chains of events and to define na-tech mitigation strategies for the critical areas singled out at provincial level. The method is structured in three main phases: the identification of elements to be involved in the scenario and their mutual relations; the singling out of the scenario key elements on which damages depend; the definition of mitigation strategies. Elements belonging to environmental, physical, functional and social system and their relations are singled out basing on scientific literature and case studies (Turkey, Northridge and Kobe earthquake, etc.) and on civil protection emergency plans and emergency fact sheets for what concerns natural and technological disasters. Case studies and literature help figuring out elements that have effectively been involved in chains of failure and damages during past na-techs and their vulnerability features. In addition, the study of civil protection emergency plans and fact sheets gives information on which are elements (e. g. roads, communication networks) people have to interact with in case of each single emergency (both to the <b>technological</b> <b>accident</b> and to the triggering natural hazard). The comparison among fact sheets allows to figure out which are the behaviours that population should be called to observe in case of a single hazard, but that, otherwise, could expose them to the other occurring hazard, in case of na-tech. Once elements and relations have been defined, they are structured in a cognitive map based scenario. A cognitive map is a support tool to set up and to explore the scenario. Through the analysis of hierarchies and relations of the map, it is possible to rank elements and to recognize which are the key ones from which the most of the other elements depend on. Moreover, it is possible to highlight hidden indirect connections among elements and the main chains of failures and damages during a na-tech event that, otherwise, should not be easy recognized. In this way, it is possible to select elements on which to concentrate resources to maximize the effectiveness of mitigation actions and to avoid triggering of failures and damages, improving the resilience of the whole urban system. Actions are grouped in an abacus and classified if they refer to environmental, physical, functional and social system and if they are mainly oriented to land uses modification, variation of the intensity of uses and to actions aimed at improving accessibility during the emergency phase. Different mitigation strategies can be defined. For instance, we could chose to implement actions on the elements belonging to one of the main chains of failures and damages or it is possible to chose to accomplish only those referring to key elements. Outcome-oriented scenarios are set up to verify the efficaciousness of strategies and to sort out the most appropriated ones. To support findings, the method has been tested on the Province of Naples (Campania Region) and on a middle size Municipality, classified as 2 nd class seismic area (Ordinance 3274 / 2003) and affected by the presence, within the city core, of a LPG storage plant, classified as dangerous by the Seveso II Directive (art. 9) ...|$|E
40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that natural disasters can trigger <b>technological</b> <b>accidents</b> and damage.

This work investigates the risk associated with the flooding of industrial installations through an analysis of past case histories and using expert judgement. The potential impact of three levels of flood severity on selected industrial facilities storing and/or processing (eco-) toxic, flammable or explosive materials is assessed qualitatively and a scale is developed that links the flood intensity {{to the level of}} potential damage.

Regions with the greatest NTA risk were revealed. The influence of natural events on the technosphere is stronger in the South of the European Russia and in the Russian Far East, which are more exposed to hurricanes, snowstorms, rainfalls, icing and other natural hazards producing NTA. The critical infrastructure needs special protection and modernization in these regions. The problem of the relationship between natural hazards and the technosphere is very complicated and needs further investigation, especially taking the expected climate changes into consideration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Secure {{energy and}} {{transport}} networks, Internet and telecommunications, are vital nerves of our highly networked society. Global mobility {{makes it difficult to}} combat and natural disasters and <b>technological</b> <b>accidents</b> can cause serious damage in a closer-knit world. In this paper we introduce the challenges in dynamic commu-nity composition of heterogeneous rescue forces (culture clash) for rescue and protec-tion tasks and discuss our approach {{in the context of the}} ”SpeedUp project ” how to present a solution for ad-hoc communication, situation-aware representation, tracking and guiding in dynamic inhomogeneous communities. ...|$|R

The importance of education in promoting and enabling disaster risk reduction has already been identified by researchers. In this paper “Disaster Date Center (DDC) ” is presented, a new, powerful and innovative tool for the study of and education on disasters. One noteworthy application of DDC is the educational and public awareness tool in the form of e-learning...|$|R
50|$|Technological crises {{are caused}} by human {{application}} of science and technology. <b>Technological</b> <b>accidents</b> inevitably occur when technology becomes complex and coupled and something goes wrong in {{the system as a}} whole (Technological breakdowns). Some technological crises occur when human error causes disruptions (Human breakdowns). People tend to assign blame for a technological disaster because technology is subject to human manipulation whereas they do not hold anyone responsible for natural disaster. When an accident creates significant environmental damage, the crisis is categorized as megadamage. Samples include software failures, industrial accidents, and oil spills.|$|R
