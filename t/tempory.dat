40|$|Although in {{the last}} few years in general the {{biocompatibility}} of biomaterials has significantly improved, unwanted tissue reactions are often observed resulting in early resorption of the biomaterial, loosening of the implant or in a chronic (immunologic) response. From immunologic studies it is known that inflammatory reactions can be modulated by use of (anti) growth factors or anti-inflammatory drugs. Before this can be employed the role of individual factors (humoral and cellular) involved in the inflammatory reaction against biomaterials has to be studied. In this part of the study the role of macrophages is studied with and without depletion by use of the liposomes-mediated macrophage suicide technique. Crosslinked dermal sheep collagens were used as biodegradable test materials. The results showed that macrophage depletion increases vascularization, and decreases the infiltration of granulocytess into the collagens. The foreign body reaction, i. e. the infiltration of macrophages and giant cells was significantly inhibited, resulting in a strongly delayed degradation time of the biomaterials. However, macrophage depletion did not inhibit attraction of fibroblasts and even resulted in increased formation of autologous rat-collagen, which improved the biocompatibility and the function of the biomaterials as a <b>tempory</b> scaffold...|$|E

Emissions in the Netherlands of priority heavy metals of the Rhine and North Sea action programmes, including Arsenic, to water and air and reduction measures, especially for diffuse sources, are presented. The future development of the heavy metal load to surface water is estimated for three scenarios: (1) autonomous (2) current policy and (3) additional measures. The goal of the Rhine and North Sea action programme (RAP/NAP) to reduce the emissions to surface water in 1995 (70 % for mercury cadmium and lead, 50 % for the other five metals) will not be realised for mercury, copper, nickel, zinc and lead. On the long term this goal can be realised with additional measures. The goal of the North Sea action programme to reduce the atmospheric emissions with 50 % will not be realised for chromium, copper, nickel, zinc and arsenic. Building material, such as tubing, galvanised steel and sheet lead, is the major source of heavy metals in surface water. Only with drastic measures that also need a long time to implement (substitution of tubing and gutters takes 20 to 40 years) substantial reduction of the emissions can be realised. Source measures only are not sufficient. While in the Netherlands there is an elaborate sewer system, additional measures at municipal treatment plants can compensate the <b>tempory</b> lack of source measures. Source measures remain important, because the autonomous growth of diffuse sources cause an increase of the emissions...|$|E

O grupo DT (n= 38) era constituído por vacas que tiveram os terneiros separados por 72 horas. O grupo NOR (n= 29) foi constituído por vacas que receberam (dia 0) um implante subcutâneo de Norgestomet e uma aplicação de Valerato de estradiol (5 mg) e Norgestomet (3 mg), intramuscular. No momento da retirada dos implantes (dia 9), os terneiros foram separados por 72 horas. O intervalo desmame-estro foi significativamente mais curto (P 0, 05) entre os grupos. O grupo NOR apresentou uma menor incidência (P The {{present study}} aims {{to compare the}} effects of removing the calf for 72 hours associated or not with Norgestomet (NOR) implant and estradiol upon estrus induction and fertility in postpartum aciclic beef cows. The temporary weaning (DT) group (n= 38) was separated from their calves for 72 hours The NOR group (n= 29) received on Day 0 a 3 mg Norgestomet implant subcutaneously and 5 mg of estradiol valerate, and 3 mg of Norgestomet intramuscular. On Day 9 the implants were removed and the calves were separated for 72 hours. The interval from weaning to estrous was significantly shorter (P< 0. 05) for cows treated with progestogens (50. 1 hours) compared with calf removal group (86. 4 hours). The estrous induction rate was significantly higher (P< 0. 05) for Norgestomet and estradiol treated cows, but ovulation rate, first pregnancy rate {{and at the end}} of the breeding season were similar for both groups. The Norgestomet and estradiol treatment of aciclic beef cows improved the estrous incidence after 72 hours <b>tempory</b> weaning. The results demonstrate that the treatment of aciclic beef cows with Norgestomet and estradiol increases the induction of estrous after 72 hours of temporary weaning, without interfering with the pregnancy rates of first estrous and in the reproductive season...|$|E
40|$|HIV {{infection}} {{undermines the}} immune system by causing a gradual loss of CD 4 + T cells. Eventually, the weakened immune system is {{no longer able to}} offer resistance to opportunistic infections and the HIV-infected individual will develop AIDS. Even after 30 years of intensive research on HIV, there is still no proficient HIV vaccine. After the failure of the largest vaccine trial to date, in 2008, the need for {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms controlling HIV infection has become painfully evident. In this thesis, we investigated 1) the cause of chronic immune activation during HIV infection and, 2) the characteristics of T-cell responses that provide protection against HIV-disease progression. Activation - We show that the two main sources of body-wide immune activation that cause HIV disease progression stimulate different cell types. Both HIV-RNA and bacterial translocation contribute to the overall immune activation, but HIV-RNA mainly causes activation of CD 8 + T-cells, while CD 4 + T-cell activation seems primarily caused by bacterial translocation. We also investigated whether very early <b>tempory</b> treatment of HIV infection could prevent chronic immune activation. Despite a better prognosis of the early treated HIV-infected individuals, we found that early temporary therapy did not lead to reduced levels of immune activation after stop of treatment. Protective T-cell responses – Although cytotoxic T-cell responses are widely held responsible for the control of HIV infection, CD 8 + T-cell depletion in monkeys was shown to have no impact on the lifespan of infected cells producing virus. We hypothesized that because CTL responses that prevent HIV disease progression occur only in a small number of HIV-infected individuals, the effect of those protective CTL responses on the life span of HIV-infected cells may easily go unnoticed. To our surprise we found that even the most protective CTL responses do not shorten the life span of productively infected cells in vivo. For the development of a vaccine, we must therefore likely focus on T cells that recognize HIV-infected cells before they start to produce new viral particles, or on CD 8 + T cells that act in a non-cytolytic way. When we studied the characteristics of the most protective CD 8 + T cells in HIV-infected individuals, namely those that interact with one of the protective HLA molecules HLA-B 27 or B 57, we found that these T cells provide protection via completely different mechanisms, making it even more difficult to identify the characteristics of a protective CD 8 + T-cell response. The current challenge is to translate the fundamental steps that have been taken in identifying the sources of immune activation and the parameters of protective T-cell responses in HIV infection into better therapies that effectively reduce immune activation and lead to a working T-cell vaccine...|$|E
