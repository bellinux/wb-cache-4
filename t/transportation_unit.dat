On 11 January 1915 the 5th Expeditionary Force was ordered north to Erzurum and eleven days later the 1st Expeditionary Force was ordered there as well. The Van Gendarmerie Regiment (police force) under the command of Staff Major Köprülü Kâzım Bey (Özalp), who would become the Minister of National Defence and Speaker of Grand National Assembly of Turkey, was the only force available to the Persian frontier. Earlier, on 14 December 1914, Van Mobile Gendarmerie Division had assumed the role of securing the road to Persia through the Qotur valley (Qotur Pass). This paramilitary formation was lightly equipped with artillery and machine guns, being primarily suited for internal security functions rather than for the invasion of a neighboring country.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} transportation activities carried out in different agribusiness entities and resulting in the overall ranking of <b>transportation</b> <b>units</b> operating in the considered agribusiness companies. It is assumed that all these units utilize their own fleet and thus arrange transportation services, by themselves, as the company's internal activities. The data for analysis is obtained from the survey research carried out on a sample of <b>transportation</b> <b>units</b> operating in 10 agribusiness companies. The authors define a consistent family of criteria that allows to evaluate transportation activity in an agribusiness industry, including both universal merits and industry specific transportation features. The evaluation matrix is constructed and the ranking of 10 <b>transportation</b> <b>units</b> is generated. It {{is based on a}} subjective model of preferences defined by the decision maker (DM) - the management teams of the analyzed agribusiness companies. The defined model of preferences includes the interests of different stakeholders, such as: customers, employees (in particular drivers) and the society. In the computational phase a multiple criteria ranking procedure called Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is applied. A series of computational experiments is carried out. As a result a company featured by the most desirable transportation performance is selected...|$|R
