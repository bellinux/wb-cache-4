5|$|The Ethics Commission later granted his {{campaign}} a reprieve, allowing Wolf {{to make an}} appeal at their next scheduled meeting on September 19. At the meeting, the Commission ruled 4-1 to reverse its decision which disqualified him from public office, allowing him <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> and renew his candidacy Governor. On October 21, Wolf announced he was ending {{his campaign}} for governor, {{due to the fact}} that even though the Ethics Commission voted to change its rules, the implementation would have likely taken several months. On June 17, 2014, Wolf endorsed Don Berwick as the Democratic nominee for governor.|$|E
25|$|The San Juan House of Representatives named Benavídez acting {{governor}} on 26 February 1836, and on 8 May 1836 he {{was elected}} governor. He was <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> this <b>office</b> with short interruptions for the next twenty years.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, Manohar Lal Sharma, an {{independent}} advocate, filed a public interest litigation petition in the Supreme Court alleging that Patil was an undischarged insolvent {{relating to the}} Sant Muktabai Sugar Factory and hence disqualified <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> the <b>office</b> of the presidency.|$|R

5|$|The Order of St Patrick {{initially}} had thirteen officers: the Prelate, the Chancellor, the Registrar, the Usher, the Secretary, the Genealogist, the King of Arms, two heralds {{and four}} pursuivants. Many of these offices were held by clergymen of the Church of Ireland, the then-established church. After the disestablishment of the Church in 1871, the ecclesiastics were allowed <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> until their deaths, when the offices were either abolished or reassigned to lay officials. All offices except that of Registrar and King of Arms are now vacant.|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 1881, Blaine and Garfield {{were walking}} through the Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad in Washington when Garfield was shot by an assassin, Charles J. Guiteau. Guiteau, a {{deranged}} man who had earlier pestered Blaine and other State Department officials to be appointed to ambassadorships {{for which he was}} grossly unqualified, believed that by assassinating the President he could ingratiate himself with Vice President Arthur and receive his coveted position. Guiteau was captured immediately and hanged just short of a year later; he survived longer than Garfield, who lingered for two-and-a-half months, then died on September 19, 1881. Garfield’s death was not just a personal tragedy for Blaine; it also meant the end of his dominance of the cabinet and the end of his foreign policy initiatives. With Arthur’s ascent to the presidency, the Stalwart faction now held sway and Blaine’s days at the State Department were numbered. Arthur asked all of the cabinet members to postpone their resignations until Congress recessed that December; Blaine nonetheless tendered his resignation on October 19, 1881 but agreed <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> until December 19, when his successor was in place. Blaine’s replacement was Frederick T. Frelinghuysen, a New Jersey Stalwart. Arthur and Frelinghuysen undid much of Blaine’s work, cancelling the call for a Pan-American conference and stopping the effort to end the War of the Pacific, but they did continue the drive for tariff reductions, signing a reciprocity treaty with Mexico in 1882.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} of San Pedro Sula, led by Mayor Felipe Zelaya Zelaya of the Liberal Party convened on 5 October {{to determine a}} response.

60|$|The {{supercargo}} squirmed and argued, and did {{his best}} to get away, but it was all to no purpose, and, in the end, he had <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> the <b>office</b> until the captain, Phil, and Roger had examined all the shipping accounts. Some of the entries were mixed up, and they could not obtain any satisfactory explanation regarding them.|$|R
5000|$|In {{confirming}} {{his retirement}} from the Senate, Caperton {{said that he}} had not grown tired or weary of his legislative duties but was committed <b>to</b> <b>remaining</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> only for ten years. Texas Secretary of State George Bayoud told the Houston Chronicle that Caperton [...] "is the one person in this state who I think made a difference" [...] in legislative matters [...] [...] [...] [...] "There's something special about Kent." [...] In reviewing his career, Caperton {{said that he had}} sought to [...] "hammer out solutions," [...] rather than engage in [...] "political posturing. It's one thing to sit on the side and harangue and pontificate. But it is equally important to bridge a compromise." [...] In his last regular legislative session in 1989, Caperton was rated No. 1 among 181 total legislators in the House and Senate by Texas Monthly magazine.|$|R
50|$|During the interregnum (1643-1660) {{the last}} Master of the Mint to King Charles, Sir Robert Harley, {{transferred}} his allegiance <b>to</b> Parliament and <b>remained</b> <b>in</b> <b>office.</b> After {{his death in}} 1656 Aaron Guerdon was appointed.|$|R

25|$|In March 2015, Johnston {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} stay in the viceregal office until September 2017. This was considered desirable {{in order to ensure that}} an experienced viceroy was in place should the 2015 Canadian federal election result in a hung parliament or otherwise be inconclusive. In September 2017, he became the longest-serving governor general since Georges Vanier. It was also thought worthwhile for Johnston <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> for the Canada 150 celebrations.|$|E

50|$|The {{total number}} of schepenen in a town depends on its population. A city like Antwerp has ten; whereas Herstappe, the {{smallest}} community in Belgium, has only two. Since a schepen is also an ordinary alderman or town councillor, {{he or she must}} be re-elected <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> the <b>office</b> of schepen. Since 2006, Belgian citizenship has not been a requirement for the position.|$|R

25|$|In January 1924, López Gutiérrez {{announced}} his intention <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> until new elections could be held, but he repeatedly refused to specify {{a date for}} the elections.

25|$|Under the new monarch, Mustafa IV, he {{attempted}} to impose a pro-French pasha as governor of Baghdad, and later provoked a scandal by asking for the Imperial Executioner, Bostanci-başi, to be demoted—this came after three Ragusan subjects, having been found guilty of theft, were subjected to falaka, despite the facts that the recent annexation of Ragusa by France offered them a degree of immunity. As {{a result of his}} pressures, Sébastiani obtained rule over the province of Baghdad for his favorite, and, in return, allowed the Bostanci-başi <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E

25|$|Li Causi and Scelba {{would be}} the main opponents in the {{aftermath}} of the massacre and the successive killing of the suspected perpetrator Giuliano, and the trial against Giuliano’s lieutenant Gaspare Pisciotta and other remaining members of Giuliano’s gang. While Scelba dismissed any political motive, Li Causi stressed the political nature of the massacre – and tried to uncover the truth. Li Causi claimed that the police inspector Ettore Messana – supposed to coordinate the persecution of the bandits – had been in league with Giuliano and denounced Scelba for allowing Messana <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> <b>office.</b> Later documents would prove the accusation.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the parliament's {{official}} swearing-in ceremony, Volodymyr Groisman was {{the chairman}} of the parliament's preparatory deputy group, with Oksana Syroyid as deputy, and Pavlo Pynzenyk as the secretary.

Meanwhile, the parliament's preparatory deputy group adopted a resolution which accepted Nadiya Savchenko's handwritten letter stating that she accepted her parliamentary mandate.

25|$|Anti-Aristide {{protests in}} January 2004 led to violent clashes in Port-au-Prince, causing several deaths. In February, a revolt {{broke out in}} the city of Gonaïves, which was soon under rebel control. The {{rebellion}} then began to spread, and Cap-Haïtien, Haiti's second-largest city, was captured. A mediation team of diplomats presented a plan to reduce Aristide's power while allowing him <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> until the end of his constitutional term. Although Aristide accepted the plan, it was rejected by the opposition, which mostly consisted of Haitian businessmen and former members of the army (who sought to reinstate the military following Aristide's disbandment of it).|$|E
25|$|Following {{the sudden}} death of John Smith {{from a heart}} attack on 12 May 1994, Margaret Beckett became the acting Labour leader, the Party's {{constitution}} providing for the automatic succession of the deputy leader {{for the remainder of the}} leadership term, upon the death or resignation of an incumbent leader in opposition. Labour leaders are subject to annual re-election at the time of the annual party conference while the party is in opposition.

Meanwhile, in the South Tower, many people saw {{what had happened}} in the North Tower and chose to evacuate as a precaution. However, the major hindrance to this process was that for the seventeen minutes between the impacts of Flight 11 and Flight 175, it had not yet been determined that a terrorist attack was unfolding, and as a result the Port Authority in the South Tower spread the word via the building's intercom system and security guards for workers in the South Tower <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> their <b>offices.</b>|$|R
