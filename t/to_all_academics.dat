40|$|This book {{analyses}} the case-law of the European Convention on Human Rights {{with particular}} {{reference to the}} margin of appreciation doctrine and the principle of proportionality. While the margin of appreciation has been {{closely associated with the}} notion of judicial restraint, the principle of proportionality is an interpretive device designed to restrain the power of State authorities and to provide greater protection of individual autonomy. By analysing the disparate fields in which Convention rights are raised, this book seeks to identify various policy grounds affecting the scope of margin and the standard of review. The survey reveals that there exists complex interplay of numerous judicial policies pursued by the European Court and Commission of Human Rights, belying a perceived dichotomy between judicial self-restraint and judicial activism. The examination of the case-law is followed by a disaggregating analysis of the margin of appreciation, an attempt that aims to elucidate criteria and rationales for the doctrines application, assisting readers better to grasp its nature. Fully incorporating the cases decided since the entry into force of the Eleventh Protocol, this book will be of interest <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>academics,</b> students and practitioners of European human rights law and international human rights law in general...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{presentation}} is to explore the necessity and strategies for strengthening the connection between sessional staff and university. Academic staff on sessional contracts undertake most of the undergraduate teaching in Higher Education (HE) yet they have little voice in the main discourses of Learning and Teaching in HE and often feel positioned {{on the periphery of}} University life and culture. Their contribution to academic integrity and student retention has been problematized and a high percentage of sessional staff (SS) or part-time tenure is seen as a risk <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>academics.</b> Yet recent research undermines the notion that ‘Sessional Staffers’ pose a risk to academia or academic standards. Instead SS have reservoirs of untapped talent that could, if harnessed, support the development of a cohesive and scholarly culture of learning and teaching. This presentation seeks to firstly offer a brief overview of the characteristics of sessional staff, identify their contribution to higher education institutions and explore why they are employed in everincreasing numbers. Secondly, it will expose the lack of connectivity SS feel towards the institutions for which they work and identify their exclusion from professional participation in many aspects of university life. Thirdly, the presentation will focus on potential strategies to enhance SS connectivity to the university they serve and support a cohesive Learning & Teaching university culture...|$|E

40|$|Property Law {{is one of}} the key {{elements}} in any property-based degree program. In particular, an understanding of ‘property law’ {{is one of the}} required knowledge fields for inclusion in property programs accredited by professional institutes such as the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, the Appraisal Institute and the Australian Property Institute. Despite the importance of property law as a cornerstone element of all property programs this aspect of the program is often approached from a more generic legal perspective with teaching resources used and pedagogical approach more aligned to the study of law than property. The specificity of this type of program is rarely adequately acknowledged. The question arises as to what the study of ‘property law’ entails and what the composition of a ‘property law’ subject should be. Replicating the methodology used by Placid and Weeks (2009) in their examination of the composition of real estate law courses in the United States, this paper examines the current composition and pedagogical approach adopted by Australian universities based on the study of three Queensland property programs. In particular the curriculum, teaching resources used, assessment and engagement strategies are considered with a view to making improvements to the way these property law courses can be more effectively tailored to property students. It is anticipated the outcomes of this paper will be of interest <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>academics</b> who are responsible for developing and delivering property law subjects and those who manage property programs in Australia and internationally...|$|E
40|$|A {{career in}} {{academics}} entails far beyond teaching. Being an academician {{is a very}} good job. The freedom to think creatively and learn is priceless. In addition, an academician working towards a PhD goes through intellectually stimulating experience to be shared. Having a PhD is a must <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>academics</b> since the PhD experience is about much more than learning to do deep work in some technical area of expertise and being constructively critical. The key is to figure out ways of moving between the different facets of the job without becoming too crazy. In another aspect, an academician is most likely to encounter his role model in teaching, research and professional service environments which are the platforms in pursuit towards excellence. In fact, these are the three main areas within which a faculty member must demonstrate excellence and achievement in order to be promoted: research, teaching and professional service. Indeed, there may be an array of promotion tracks to fit such different career paths; these tracks may have different requirements for promotion. It is critically important that the junior faculty member be familiar with the requirements of their particular track early {{in the course of their}} career. He should find out the relevant requirements and expectations for promotion and be thinking about these matters from an early point in his career, rather than near the end when the promotion clock is ticking. This paper also focuses on the significance of getting a PhD, sharing good lessons and experiences during doctorate training, and giving practical job strategy description and academic solution...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - To explore academics' {{experiences}} of using {{information and communication}} technologies (ICTs) for teaching and learning. Design/methodology/approach - Analysis of three discipline-specific focus group discussions held with academics based in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) that use ICTs for teaching their students. Findings - The most common use of ICTs in all subjects was to provide students with access to a range of online resources. Academics' motivations for using ICTs included: enhancing the educational experience for their students; to compensate for some of the changes occurring in higher education, such as the rise in student numbers and demand for flexible learning opportunities; and personal interest and enjoyment. The difficulties academics encountered when using these technologies for teaching included: a lack of time; dissatisfaction with the software available; and copyright. Research limitations/implications - This is a small scale, exploratory study. Further research is required that is sampled {{in such a way as}} to ensure that the findings can be generalized <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>academics</b> in all institutions in the UK. Practical implications - The institutional, middle managerial, staff and student level all need to be considered when encouraging the further adoption of new technologies for teaching and learning in higher education. Institutional level strategies must also account for the diversity of ways ICTs may be used in teaching in different contexts across the institution. Originality/value - Research exploring academics' {{experiences of}} using ICTs for teaching and learning is scarce. Further work is required to ensure the successful development and implementation of future technological and policy developments in this area. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|E

40|$|How can discerning {{critical}} hope {{enable us}} to develop innovative forms of teaching, learning and social practices that begin to address issues of marginalization, privilege and access across different contexts? At this millennial point in history, questions of cynicism, despair and hope arise at every turn, especially within areas of research into social justice and the struggle for transformation in education. While a sense of fatalism and despair is easily recognizable, establishing compelling bases for hope is more difficult. This book addresses the absence of sustained analyses of hope that simultaneously recognize the hard edges of why we despair. The volume posits the notion of critical hope not only as conceptual and theoretical, but also as an action-oriented response to despair. Our notion of critical hope is used in two ways: it is used firstly as a unitary concept which cannot be disaggregated into either hopefulness or criticality, and secondly, as an analytical concept, where critical hope is engaged and diversely theorized in ways that recognize aspects of individual and collective directions of critical hope. The book is divided into four sub-sections: Critical Hope in Education Critical Hope and a Critique of Neoliberalism Critical Race Theory/Postcolonial Perspectives on Critical Hope Philosophical Overviews of Critical Hope. Education can be a purveyor of critical hope, but it also requires critical hope so that it, as a sector itself, can be transformative. With contributions from international experts in the field, the book will be of value <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>academics</b> and practitioners {{working in the field}} of education...|$|E
40|$|Scholars in Malaysia {{are full}} {{aware of the}} variety of rules and {{regulations}} that effectively take away their academic freedoms thus making it difficult to carry out their teaching and research responsibilities, in a creative and innovative way. The oath of allegiance for example is considered oppressive because it is related to the statutory Bodies (Discipline and Surcharge) Act 2000. This act in effect makes it an offence for any scholars to comment on governmental policies (whether favorably or critically) without appropriate permission. It is highly impractical for the authorities to process the requests from all scholars every time they wish to make a statement or write an article that touches upon governmental policies. Therefore, one can only presume that this law is meant to be used as and when the authorities wish to. That is to say it becomes prevalent and ever present threat <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>academics.</b> There is no denying that academic freedom is the core value of creating an open and innovative society a prerequisite for a sustainable economy. Without academic freedom, the dissemination of information will suffer. The general public depends on the academe to provide unbiased views on social and economy analysis so as to strengthened civil society. This can only be achieved if only freedoms of expression are enjoyed by the scholars. This paper will discussed the restrictions and regulations imposed by various regulations, all of which curtail the scope and freedom of research and teaching.

40|$|International audienceThis book is {{the first}} {{collected}} volume to be entirely dedicated {{to the work of}} contemporary Anglo-American writer Patrick McGrath. It follows the international conference that was held in his presence at Perpignan University, France, in May 2011. It comprises nine chapters (as well as an introduction and an index) written by scholars specializing in Gothic and American literature, each dealing with specific aspects of McGrath’s work. The volume seeks to encompass the author’s whole literary production to date, spanning a 25 -year writing career. It also features an exclusive afterword written by the author himself, who attended all the papers given during the conference with great attention and often intensely enthusiastic reactivity. The editor’s intention is twofold. The idea was first to provide a comprehensive survey of Patrick McGrath’s writing, returning to the aspects that are usually associated with the author’s work, such as his artful narrative control, his inclination for stories of “transgression and decay”, as well as his long-lasting reflexive relationship with the Gothic and the Grotesque. Yet the aim of this volume is also to open new directions for the study of McGrath’s texts, taking into account the noticeable evolution of the writer’s literary production, its growing Americanization and gradual distanciation with modes of excess. It seems that it is no longer possible to tag McGrath’s work as neo- or ‘postmodern’ Gothic. His books’ growing complexity and change of horizons call for fresh investigations. This book will be of interest to students of McGrath’s work, scholars of the Gothic and its contemporary manifestations, as well as <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>academics</b> specializing in contemporary American fiction...|$|E

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The {{benefits}} of e-assessment are widely documented (Bull and McKenna 2004). However, instances of good practice {{have not been}} systematically reported. Recognising and acknowledging this gap in the research, the JISC Organisational Committee has funded a number of projects on e-assessment practice: ‘E-Assessment Glossary’, ‘The Roadmap to E-Assessment’ together {{with a set of}} case studies of innovative and effective practice. This paper is based on the findings of the JISC Case Study Project “The innovative and effective use of E-Assessment”. Members of the project team conducted over 90 interviews with teaching staff, senior management, developers and students to showcase all aspects of e-assessment. The project offered a unique opportunity to observe different organisational structures and gain inside-information about the effectiveness of a number of different applications. The 17 case studies and their follow-up surveys have been studied to identify the facilitating factors for the introduction of e-assessment and the organisational structures supporting e-assessment have also been investigated. The focus of this analysis was to study the different organisational structures and to identify patterns herein. We suggest that the key characteristics for the typology are the position of the e-assessment within the organisational structure and the support from the senior management. Three types of organisational structures are identified by the study, which support innovative practice. These are the Central Team, the Faculty based Team and the Departmental Champion. The Central Team offers e-assessment support and, in some cases, production services <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>academics</b> on a university-wide basis whilst the Faculty Based Team provides a more limited discipline-related service.

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{previous}} application of Alfred Whitehead 2 ̆ 7 s educational {{ideas to the}} domain of enterprise education. In doing so, a unique approach to enterprise education is illustrated that links students to their reality whilst also connecting the curriculum to contemporary entrepreneurship theory. The paper reports upon past cycles of reflective practice related to the developing hic et nunc teaching and learning framework. Two specific findings of note have emerged. First, that students’ learning outcomes are enhanced through the oscillating influence of freedom and discipline. However, {{in the absence of}} either factor, suboptimal outcomes are seen to occur. That is, an imbalance between freedom and discipline has resulted in sub-optimal outcomes from either a lack of student interest or an inability to adequately apply acquired knowledge. Where gains have been made, the most obvious process has been through consultation with students. Second, that the students also {{play an important role in}} shaping the nature of the learning environments within which they interact. Both findings are of significant importance <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>academics</b> charged with the responsibility of developing enterprise education curriculum. The main implication of the paper is that in the absence of sound pedagogical practises, it is possible that enterprise programs may develop a tendency to reinforce past practises. The processes of constructive alignment and criterion-based assessment are argued to offer avenues through which students can influence the educational process. They also provide the educator with a reflective pathway through which continual improvements are constantly possible. This paper provides other academics with a window through which to view the ongoing development of a process that has been recognised nationally for teaching excellence and influenced many fine young entrepreneurs. The paper also draws attention to a set of core educational philosophies that have transferable value to any academic setting. It is noted that the task of developing a learner-centred curriculum for enterprise education has been an entrepreneurial endeavour in itself. Many mistakes have been made and many memorable achievements have been celebrated...|$|E
