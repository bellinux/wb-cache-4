5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> travels {{into the}} pocket {{universe}} and receives transmitted images of his companions in the subwave signal. After Davros hijacks the signal and taunts <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> about his resurrection and imminent victory, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> breaks communication and attempts to convene with his companions. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> lands on the same street Rose is searching for him on and runs to embrace her, but is shot by a Dalek.

5|$|Convinced of Barclay's claims, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> {{prepares to}} destroy the ship when Chakotay (Robert Beltran) arrives and gives an {{alternative}} story: <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> is indeed the Voyager EMH, but his program is stuck in the malfunctioning holodeck. The crew is trying to extricate his program so he only needs to wait it out; if he destroys the ship as Barclay suggests, it will prematurely end the program and <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> will be lost. Even though Barclay introduces Kes (Jennifer Lien) as Zimmerman's wife, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> finally opts to believe in his holographic existence. The simulation ends and <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> finds himself on the holodeck; Chakotay's story was true and <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> is safely returned to sickbay.|$|E

Craig, encouraged by <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> telling him that this is his {{chance to be a}} father, fights and reverses the conversion. The rest of the Cybermen painfully experience the emotions they have repressed from Craig's struggle, and their circuits start to overload. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> and Craig escape via the teleporter as the ship explodes, the blast contained by the cavern. Craig reunites with Alfie, while <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> slips away unseen. Craig returns home to find <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> already there, having used time travel to clean the house. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> tells Craig that Alfie now has a much higher opinion of his dad. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> leaves just before Sophie returns but Alfie's first word ('Doctor') reveal the events during her absence.|$|E

5|$|In the TARDIS, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> {{agrees to}} take Rose {{to the day}} her father died {{so that she can}} be there when it happens. Upon their arrival in London on Saturday 7 November 1987, they witness the {{accident}}, but Rose is unable to move when <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> tells her to go comfort her dying father. Rose asks <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> if she can try again, and <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> allows it but warns Rose to not run until their former selves have left to prevent a paradox. As the accident is about to happen, Rose suddenly runs out and pushes Pete aside, saving his life. The younger versions of <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> and Rose vanish. Rose and <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> fight about her actions, with <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> rebuking her for potentially damaging the timeline. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> takes Rose's TARDIS key back and storms off without her. Rose decides to go with Pete to the wedding, while <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> walks back to the TARDIS only to find that it is now an empty shell. Strange flying beasts called Reapers appear and begin consuming people.|$|E

He learns that the Great Intelligence has been controlling the snowmen and has taken interest in Latimer's pond. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> visits the pond and deduces that the Great Intelligence is using the old governess' body as a DNA blueprint to form an ice creature that will retain its form and not melt. While Clara is putting the children to bed, the frozen body of the governess breaks into the house. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> fights her off and is joined by Vastra, Jenny and Strax. Dr. Simeon arrives with more snowmen and tells them he wants the governess' ice body. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> flees with Clara to the roof of the mansion and then to the TARDIS hovering overhead. They are pursued by the ice governess, whom <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> traps under a layer of frozen ice crystals.

5|$|After {{stepping}} out of the TARDIS in modern-day Colchester, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> is blown off his feet by a blast of air, and the TARDIS, Amy still inside, dematerialises into the time vortex and refuses to rematerialise. With Amy's help, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> tracks the disturbance to the second floor of a house. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> opts to take a room for rent offered by the downstairs tenant, Craig Owens, in order to determine what is present on the second floor without alerting whatever it is to his Time Lord nature. Neither Craig nor <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> are aware that people are being lured off the street to the second floor flat and never leaving again, but <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> is conscious of localised time loops and disturbances aboard the TARDIS that coincide with noises from the second floor.|$|E

5|$|Amy and Rory {{discover}} that the wounded Doctor had told his earlier self to create a diversion, allowing him to rig the Pandorica to fly into the TARDIS explosion. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> postulates that enough of the original universe still exists in the Pandorica to completely restore it via the exploding TARDIS. After a tearful farewell to Amy, Rory, and River where he instructs Amy to focus on her family and Rory to restore them in the new universe, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> engages the Pandorica and flies it into the exploding TARDIS.

Afterwards, upon reflection, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> decides not to keep the name Schweitzer, as his memories associated with it are too painful.|$|E
50|$|In the program's early years, <b>The</b> <b>Doctors</b> was {{considered}} to be more risqué in storyline choices than its rival, General Hospital (which premiered on the same day, with a similar premise to TD). While <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> on General Hospital worked in harmony with one another for the most part and in some cases were intimate friends, the physicians on <b>The</b> <b>Doctors</b> were much more cutthroat. Also, <b>The</b> <b>Doctors</b> incorporated far more incidental humor and realism into its storylines, and remained anchored to actual medical work in its setting far longer than GH did. General Hospital, by contrast, was much more conventional, relying much more heavily on traditional soap devices such as murder trials, melodrama, extensive sexual trysts and affairs, love triangles, and amnesia than <b>The</b> <b>Doctors.</b>|$|R
