5|$|Burton {{had never}} been {{particularly}} close <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents,</b> but his father's death in October 2000 and his mother's in March 2002 affected him deeply. Following the production of Planet of the Apes (2001), the director {{wanted to get back}} to making a smaller film. Burton enjoyed the script, feeling that it was the first unique story he was offered since Beetlejuice (1988). Burton also found appeal in the story's combination of an emotional drama with exaggerated tall tales, which allowed him to tell various stories of different genres. He signed to direct in April 2002, which prompted Richard D. Zanuck, who worked with Burton on Planet of the Apes, to join Big Fish as a producer. Zanuck also had a difficult relationship with his own father, Darryl F. Zanuck, who once fired him as head of production at 20th Century Fox.|$|E

Sharon, too, was thinking about ways out of the marriage; according to John Boldizs, she once offered him $1,000 to kill her husband or find someone who would, although he later claimed that she may have been joking.|$|E

5|$|During Barry's career, he was {{credited}} with saving the lives of more than forty people, although this number has sometimes varied over the years.

The child survived and was returned <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents,</b> although other sources say that the boy's mother died in the avalanche that trapped the boy.

5|$|In 1965, Fredrik Reinfeldt {{was born}} in Allmänna BB {{hospital}} in Stockholm and was the oldest of three brothers <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> Bruno (1938-2016) and Birgitta Reinfeldt. At {{the time of his}} birth his parents lived in an apartment in Österhaninge, in the south of Stockholm County, but a short time afterwards the family moved to London, where his father worked as a consultant for Shell. Upon returning to Sweden, the family first lived in an apartment in Handen before moving to a terraced house in Bromsten in northwestern Stockholm. The Reinfeldt family was living in Bromsten when Fredrik's younger brothers, Magnus and Henrik, were born in 1969 and 1973. In 1976 the family moved into a single-family home in Täby in northeastern Stockholm County. His mother Birgitta was a leadership and management consultant, and some of her professional skills might have inspired and impressed the young Fredrik.|$|E
5|$|Lynch {{conceived}} South of Nowhere {{from the}} idea of a teenager's coming out after hearing that his friend's son had come out <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents.</b> Lynch pitched the premise to The N and was commissioned to write the pilot. After the casting process was complete, the episode was filmed in October 2004, but when the show was picked up for a full season, Lynch decided to recast many of the characters and the pilot was shot again in July 2005 with the new cast. The premiere of the episode was promoted with branded MetroCards that were handed out to teenagers in Manhattan. Generally, critics reviewed the pilot positively, particularly commending its treatment of current social issues; however, some critics found the show's introduction of these issues to be forced and inauthentic.|$|E
