Jackman, who played Wolverine {{in the previous}} films, has also become producer of the film via his company Seed Productions, and earned $25million for the film. Jackman underwent a high intensity weight training regimen to improve his physique for the role. He altered the program <b>to</b> <b>shock</b> his body into change and also performed cardiovascular workouts. Jackman noted no digital touches were applied to his physique in a shot of him rising from the tank within which Wolverine has his bones infused with adamantium.|$|E
5|$|Backing up {{the guns}} were the fighter {{aircraft}} of the North Vietnamese Air Force, which originally consisted of only 53 MiG-17 Fresco fighter aircraft. Though considered antiquated by the Americans {{when compared to}} their supersonic jets, the North Vietnamese turned their aircraft's weaknesses into strengths. They were fast enough for hit and run ambush operations and they were also maneuverable enough <b>to</b> <b>shock</b> the American fighter community by shooting down more advanced F-8 Crusaders and F-105 Thunderchiefs, which had to quickly develop new tactics. The newer missile-armed F-4 Phantom would become the Americans' primary dogfighting platform.|$|E
5|$|Infrared {{emission}} {{also reveals}} {{the presence of}} un-ionised material such as molecular hydrogen (H2) and argon. In many planetary nebulae, molecular emission is greatest at larger distances from the star, where more material is un-ionised, but molecular hydrogen emission in NGC 6543 seems to be bright at the inner edge of its outer halo. This may be due <b>to</b> <b>shock</b> waves exciting the H2 as ejecta moving at different speeds collide. The overall appearance of the Cat's Eye Nebula in infrared (wavelengths 2–8μm) is similar in visible light.|$|E

This gives a richer characterization than previous studies. Lower income countries are vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>shocks,</b> especially {{in terms of}} trade (associated with the greatest revenue loss) : democratic regimes seem to be less vulnerable to revenue losses due <b>to</b> <b>shocks</b> than non-democracies whereas revenue in resource rich is more vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>shocks</b> (except natural disasters) than non-resource rich countries. We find a negative relationship between manufacturing exports and revenue in lower income countries...|$|R

In particular, they assess separately the adjustment <b>to</b> region-specific <b>shocks,</b> <b>to</b> common <b>shocks</b> with asymmetric effects and <b>to</b> national <b>shocks.</b> They find that {{a significant difference between}} the EU and the USA can be found only in the response of mobility <b>to</b> common <b>shocks</b> with asymmetric effects. In contrast, the mobility response <b>to</b> region-specific <b>shocks</b> plays a relatively minor role both for the EU and the USA and appears to fall over time. Finally, inter-country mobility in response <b>to</b> country-specific <b>shocks</b> is less important than the inter-regional mobility in response <b>to</b> region-specific <b>shocks.</b>|$|R

Sayid is suspended upside down, held by a rope, and recites the Shahadah. A mysterious French woman (Mira Furlan) cuts him down and ties him to a bed in a bunker. She asks where Alex is, but when Sayid says he does not know, she uses batteries and a cable <b>to</b> <b>shock</b> him. Sayid tells his torturer about the plane crash and the French transmission the survivors heard when they first crashed on the island. The torturer then identifies herself as Danielle Rousseau, the woman who sent out the transmission. Danielle finds a picture of a woman among Sayid's possessions, and Sayid identifies the subject as Nadia.|$|E
5|$|Timbaland {{spoke to}} MTV's Shaheem Reid back in July 2008 {{to confirm that}} {{he was working on}} the {{follow-up}} to his platinum selling Shock Value. At the time he confirmed that he had one track with Madonna which although recorded for her album Hard Candy it had not been used and could end up on this album instead. He was insistent that he would also collaborate with Jordin Sparks, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Jonas Brothers, Miley Cyrus and T.I. However, none of these collaborations (except Miley Cyrus) made it to the final track list. He also said that alongside T-Pain who would definitely appear, he hoped to get Jay-Z on board, although he ultimately failed to do so. Timbaland began working on the sequel <b>to</b> <b>Shock</b> Value in July 2008. In March 2009, he filed a lawsuit against his label, Blackground Records, alleging that they attempted to blackball him after he decided to move from music performance into production.|$|E

Makkhi goes to Chedi seek help from him, without knowing that it was Chedi, who burnt his factory. Chedi agrees to finance his father's treatment, if he {{delivers}} a crate of mangoes to Dayal Babu's house. Unknown to Makkhi, there is a bomb inside the crate, which explodes after he leaves, killing Dayal Babu. Chedi gives Makkhi a task to kill Chulbul. Makkhi accepts, and confesses it to Chulbul. He reveals to Chulbul that Chedi made him plant the bomb unknowingly. Chulbul forgives him and reconciles with his stepfather. Makkhi then reveals to Chulbul that it was Chedi, who killed their mother. Enraged, Chulbul suffocates Chedi to death. Later, Chulbul gets Makkhi married to Nirmala {{in the presence of}} her father, while Rajjo reveals that she is pregnant.|$|E

40|$|Amid {{increasing}} regulation, {{structural changes}} {{of the market and}} Quantitative Easing as well as extremely low yields, concerns about the market liquidity of the Eurozone sovereign debt markets have been raised. We aim to quantify illiquidity risks, especially such related to liquidity dry-ups, and illiquidity spillover across maturities by examining the reaction <b>to</b> illiquidity <b>shocks</b> at high frequencies in two ways: a) the regular response <b>to</b> <b>shocks</b> using a variance decomposition and, b) the response <b>to</b> <b>shocks</b> in the extremes by detecting illiquidity shocks and modeling those as ultivariate Hawkes processes. We find that: a) market liquidity is more fragile and less predictable when an asset is very illiquid and, b) the response <b>to</b> <b>shocks</b> in the extremes is structurally different from the regular response. In 2015 long-term bonds are less liquid and the medium-term bonds are liquid, although we observe that in the extremes the medium-term bonds are increasingly driven by illiquidity spillover from the long-term titles...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how banks respond <b>to</b> <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> their equity. If banks react <b>to</b> equity <b>shocks</b> {{by more than}} proportionately adjusting liabilities, then this will tend to generate {{a positive correlation between}} asset growth and leverage growth. However, we show that in the presence of changes in liabilities that are uncorrelated with <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> equity, a positive correlation of this sort can occur without banks adjusting <b>to</b> equity <b>shocks</b> by more than proportionately adjusting liabilities. The paper uses data from US bank holding companies to estimate an empirical model of bank balance sheet adjustment. We identify <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> equity as well as orthogonal <b>shocks</b> <b>to</b> bank liabilities and show that both equity and liabilities tend to adjust to move leverage towards target ratios. We also show that banks allow leverage ratios to fall in response <b>to</b> positive equity <b>shocks,</b> though this pattern is weaker for large banks, which are more active in adjusting liabilities after these shocks. We show how this explains why large banks have lower correlations between asset growth and leverage growth...|$|R

In our analysis, {{we focus on the}} differentials in inflation and unemployment between countries, as they directly reflect how the currency union responds <b>to</b> <b>shocks.</b> We highlight the following three results: First, we show {{that it is important to}} distinguish between different labor market rigidities as they have opposite effects on inflation and unemployment differentials. Second, we find that asymmetries in labor market structures tend to increase the volatility of both inflation and unemployment differentials. Finally, we show that it is important to take into account the interaction between different types of labor market rigidities. Overall, our results suggest that asymmetries in labor market structures worsen the adjustment of a currency union <b>to</b> <b>shocks...</b>|$|R
