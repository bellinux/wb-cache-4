25|$|Atheism in {{the twentieth}} century found {{recognition}} {{in a wide variety of}} other, broader philosophies in the Western tradition, such as existentialism, Objectivism, secular humanism, nihilism, logical positivism, Marxism, anarchism, feminism, and the general scientific and rationalist movement. Neopositivism and analytical philosophy discarded classical rationalism and metaphysics in favor of strict empiricism and epistemological nominalism. Proponents such as Bertrand Russell emphatically rejected belief in God. In his early work, Ludwig Wittgenstein attempted to separate metaphysical and supernatural language from rational discourse. H. L. Mencken sought to debunk both the idea that science and religion are compatible, and the idea <b>that</b> <b>science</b> <b>is</b> a dogmatic belief system just like any religion.|$|E
25|$|The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community {{believes}} that divine decree controls the eventual outcome of all actions in this universe. Within {{the boundaries of}} divine decree, man is given free will to choose the course. Ahmadi Muslims believe {{that they will be}} judged {{on the basis of their}} intentions and deeds on the Day of Judgment. Ahmadis believe <b>that</b> <b>science</b> <b>is</b> the study of the acts of God and religion is the study of the word of God and the two cannot possibly contradict each other. They believe that Adam, the prophet, was simply the first Prophet and not the first human on earth, as understood by them being in the Quran. Ahmadi Muslims do believe in the theory of biological evolution, albeit guided by God.|$|E
25|$|Others such as Francis Collins, Kenneth R. Miller, George Coyne and Francisco J. Ayala {{argue for}} {{compatibility}} {{since they do}} not agree <b>that</b> <b>science</b> <b>is</b> incompatible with religion and vice versa. They argue that science provides many opportunities to look for and find God in nature and {{to reflect on their}} beliefs. According to Kenneth Miller, he disagrees with Jerry Coyne's assessment and argues that since significant portions of scientists are religious and the proportion of Americans believing in evolution is much higher, it implies that both are indeed compatible. Elsewhere, Miller has argued that when scientists make claims on science and theism or atheism, they are not arguing scientifically at all and are stepping beyond the scope of science into discourses of meaning and purpose. What he finds particularly odd and unjustified is in how atheists often come to invoke scientific authority on their non-scientific philosophical conclusions like there being no point or no meaning to the universe as the only viable option when the scientific method and science never have had any way of addressing questions of meaning or God in the first place. Furthermore, he notes that since evolution made the brain and since the brain can handle both religion and science, there is no natural incompatibility between the concepts at the biological level.|$|E

2500|$|Among {{opponents of}} the {{mainstream}} scientific assessment, some say that while there is agreement that humans do {{have an effect on}} climate, there is no universal agreement about the quantitative magnitude of anthropogenic global warming (AGW) relative to natural forcings and its harm to benefit ratio. Other opponents assert that some kind of ill-defined [...] "consensus argument" [...] is being used, and then dismiss this by arguing <b>that</b> <b>science</b> <b>is</b> based on facts rather than consensus. Some highlight the dangers of focusing on only one viewpoint in the context of what they say is unsettled science, or point out <b>that</b> <b>science</b> <b>is</b> based on facts and not on opinion polls or consensus.|$|E
2500|$|Ever since Tesla's 1890s lectures, Tesla coils {{have been}} used as attractions in {{educational}} exhibits and science fairs.

2500|$|One of {{the struggles}} for both fields is a divide between {{restoration}} ecology and ecological restoration in practice. Currently, many restoration practitioners {{as well as}} scientists feel <b>that</b> <b>science</b> <b>is</b> not being adequately incorporated into ecological restoration projects.

2500|$|Gould {{is deeply}} {{influenced}} by Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. [...] Kuhn argued, in part, <b>that</b> <b>science</b> <b>is</b> a social activity and that theories are intellectual constructions imposed on data, not demanded by them. [...] Along with Kuhn and other philosophers and sociologists of science, Gould has recognized that mental constructs (metaphors, analogies, personal philosophies, imaginative leaps)—not empirical discoveries—are what bring about scientific advance. [...] "Facts" [...] are so {{embedded in a}} paradigm that they simply {{do not have the}} kind of independent probative power they were once thought to possess.|$|E

50|$|The phrase {{was derived}} from Sturgeon's {{observation}} <b>that</b> while <b>science</b> fiction <b>was</b> often derided for its low quality by critics, it could {{be noted that the}} majority of examples of works in other fields could equally be seen to be of low quality and <b>that</b> <b>science</b> fiction <b>was</b> thus no different in that regard from other art forms.|$|R

Scientifically speaking, neither the Gregorian calendar nor the new calendar is absolutely precise. This is because the solar year cannot be evenly divided into 24-hour segments. So any public calendar is imprecise; it is simply an agreed-upon designation of days.|$|E
2500|$|... "What is {{the purpose}} of science?" [...] is the {{question}} repeatedly asked in Poincaré's book. To this teleological problem, Poincaré responds by taking the opposite position from that of Édouard Le Roy, philosopher and mathematician, who argued in a 1905 article (Sur la logique de l'invention, [...] "On the logic of invention") <b>that</b> <b>science</b> <b>is</b> intrinsically anti-intellectual (in the sense of Henri Bergson) and nominalistic. In contrast to Le Roy, Poincaré follows the thought of Pierre Duhem. He explains that the notion <b>that</b> <b>science</b> <b>is</b> anti-intellectual is self-contradictory, and that the accusation of nominalism can be strongly criticized, because it rests on confusions of thoughts and definitions. He defends the idea of conventional principles, and the idea that scientific activity is not merely a set of conventions arranged arbitrarily around the raw observations of experiment. He wishes rather to demonstrate that objectivity in science comes precisely {{from the fact that the}} scientist does no more than translate raw facts into a particular language: [...] "(...) tout ce que crée le savant dans un fait, c'est le langage dans lequel il l'énonce". The only contribution of science would be the development of a more and more mathematized language, a coherent language because it offers predictions which are useful – but not certain, as they remain forever subject to comparisons with real observations, and are always fallible.|$|E
2500|$|Therefore, {{philosophy}} {{should feel}} free {{to make use of}} the findings of scientists in its own pursuit, while also feeling free to offer criticism when those claims are ungrounded, confused, or inconsistent. In Quine's view, philosophy is [...] "continuous with" [...] science and both are empirical. Naturalism is not a dogmatic belief that the modern view of science is entirely correct. Instead, it simply holds <b>that</b> <b>science</b> <b>is</b> the best way to explore the processes of the universe and that those processes are what modern science is striving to understand. [...] However, this Quinean Replacement Naturalism finds relatively few supporters among philosophers.|$|E
