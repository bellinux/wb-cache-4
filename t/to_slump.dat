5|$|Utah {{and western}} Colorado were {{deformed}} as {{the rate of}} subduction off the west coast increased in the Middle Jurassic Sevier Orogeny. At the same time, an inland sea began to encroach on the continent from the north. Broad tidal flats and streams carrying iron oxide-rich mud formed {{on the margins of}} the shallow sea to the west, creating the Sinawava member of the Temple Cap Formation. Flat-bedded sandstones, siltstones, and limestones filled depressions left in the underlying eroded strata. Streams eroded the poorly cemented Navajo Sandstone, and water caused the sand <b>to</b> <b>slump.</b>|$|E

25|$|Preston {{were perhaps}} the biggest chokers as they lost 5 of their final 7 games <b>to</b> <b>slump</b> out of the {{play-off}} places they had occupied through {{the bulk of the}} season, missing out on a third successive play-off finish. Cardiff City had been the early pace-setters, leading the table up until the midway point before their form tailed off badly in the second half.|$|E
25|$|Density {{contrasts}} {{can also}} cause small-scale faulting, even while sedimentation progresses (synchronous-sedimentary faulting). Such faulting can also occur when large masses of non-lithified sediment are deposited on a slope, such as at the front side of a delta or the continental slope. Instabilities in such sediments can result in the deposited material <b>to</b> <b>slump,</b> producing fissures and folding. The resulting structures in the rock are syn-sedimentary folds and faults, which {{can be difficult to}} distinguish from folds and faults formed by tectonic forces acting on lithified rocks.|$|E
25|$|Shah Jahan gave {{orders in}} 1631 to Qasim Khan, the Mughal viceroy of Bengal, {{to drive out}} the Portuguese from their trading post at Port Hoogly. The post was heavily armed with cannons, battleships, {{fortified}} walls, and other instruments of war. The Portuguese were accused of trafficking by high Mughal officials and due to commercial competition the Mughal-controlled port of Saptagram began <b>to</b> <b>slump.</b> Shah Jahan was particularly outraged by the activities of Jesuits in that region, notably when they were accused of abducting peasants. On 25 September 1632 the Mughal Army raised imperial banners and gained control over the Bandel region and the garrison was punished.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} day former club captain Gary McAllister, {{who had been}} captain the last time Leeds won the League Championship, was appointed as the club's new manager with Steve Staunton his assistant. After the New Year, Leeds's form began <b>to</b> <b>slump</b> badly, the team going seven games without a win at one stage, {{and by the end}} of March the team had fallen to mid-table, and their promotion hopes looked to be in tatters. However, an excellent run of seven wins from their last eight games saw them secure fifth place and a play-off spot; without the well-publicised points deduction they would have finished second and earned automatic promotion. The deduction was heavily appealed, but this ultimately failed on 1 May 2008 when an independent arbitration panel ruled that the Football League were right to give Leeds this deduction.|$|E
25|$|The 2007–08 was eventful for Redden. Newly {{promoted}} General Manager Bryan Murray {{attempted to}} trade Redden to the Edmonton Oilers during the 2007 NHL Entry Draft. Redden {{turned down the}} trade proposal. Trade rumours would swirl around Redden {{for most of the}} season, though he remained a starter with the team and played in his 800th career NHL game on January 10, 2008, against the Buffalo Sabres. As the team began <b>to</b> <b>slump,</b> Murray started to look for solutions to turn the team around. In February 2008, it was revealed that Redden used the no trade clause in his contract to kill a deal that would have sent him to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for Matt Carle and a draft pick. As the leaked deal became public, Redden publicly declared his desire to win the Stanley Cup with Ottawa, at the time still the Eastern Conference leader. Within weeks of the aborted trade, the Sharks surpassed Ottawa in the League-wide standings, and the Senators performance continued to decline; the coach was eventually fired and the team struggled into the playoffs.|$|E
25|$|In {{the semifinals}} at the Eden Gardens in Calcutta on 13 March 1996, India played Sri Lanka in a match which became notorious for the {{extremely}} poor crowd behaviour. India won the toss and chose to field first. Both the openers Kaluwitharana and Jayasuriya were dismissed in Srinath's first over, uppercutting wide balls down to third man. Srinath then removed veteran Asanka Gurusinha {{to leave the}} score at 35/3. However half centuries from Aravinda de Silva and Roshan Mahanama helped Sri Lanka reach a formidable total of 251/8. India made a solid start, with Sachin Tendulkar (65 from 88 balls, 9 fours) scoring a half-century and taking India to 1/98. However, the pitch began to crumble and take more spin, and when Tendulkar was stumped, the remaining Indian batsmen were unable {{to cope with the}} four pronged spin-attack of Jayasuriya, Muttiah Muralitharan and part timers de Silva and Kumar Dharmasena, who altogether took 6 wickets as India lost 7 wickets for 22 runs <b>to</b> <b>slump</b> to 120/8 in the 35th over, with still 132 runs to win. At this point, sections of the crowd began setting fire to the stands and throwing missiles onto the field. Play was stopped as the crowd's anger began to develop into a dangerous riot. The umpires and match referee Clive Lloyd decided to award the game to Sri Lanka because India had no chance of winning from their current position in the match even if the match were to resume, knocking them out of the World Cup.|$|E

25|$|The Phillies entered June with {{a record}} of 27–25 and 3 games behind the Washington Nationals for first place in the East Division. The Phillies started the month by winning the first game to the Miami Marlins, but then lost the next 2. The Phillies {{struggled}} in the next series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, losing all 4 games in the series, causing them <b>to</b> <b>slump</b> to a 6-game losing streak and 5.5 games behind the Nationals. The Phillies then won 1 of 3 games against the Baltimore Orioles and 2 of 3 games against the Minnesota Twins. However, they would get swept by the Toronto Blue Jays In game 2 of the series, it looked like Cliff Lee was about to finally get his first win of the season, but the Phillies ended up blowing a 5–2 lead in extra innings. Then the Phillies won 2 of 3 games against the struggling Colorado Rockies In the next series against the Tampa Bay Rays, game 1 was postponed to a double header on the same day as game 3. In game 2 of the series, however, the Phillies took a 2-run lead heading into the top of the 9th inning. The Rays however ended up tying the game, putting the game tied at 6–6 heading into the bottom of 9th inning. In the inning, Jim Thome hit a walk-off home run, giving the Phillies the win and putting Thome in 1st place in career walk-off homers. The Phillies would lose both games the next day, though. In the next series against the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Phillies would win the first 2 games of the series, but then lose the next 2. The Phillies would end the month by getting swept by the Marlins. By the end of July 1, the Phillies were 11 games behind the 1st place Nationals. At the end of the month, The Phillies traded Jim Thome to the Orioles for Class A players Gabriel Lino and Kyle Simon.|$|E

500|$|The least weasel has a {{very wide}} circumboreal range and a large total {{population}} and is therefore listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of [...] "least concern". Its chosen habitat is in areas of coarse vegetation and in some regions its numbers may be decreasing because of changes in agricultural practices, but altogether its population trend {{is thought to be}} steady. It is relatively common in Eurasia but less abundant in North America and is thought to be rare in the southeastern United States. It is subject to considerable variations in numbers in areas where its main rodent prey is liable to large population fluctuations. In years of rodent population booms, the least weasel numbers may rise by up to ten-fold, only <b>to</b> <b>slump</b> again as prey becomes scarce again in the following years.|$|E
50|$|As {{rotational}} velocity increases, <b>slumping</b> transitions <b>to</b> cataracting motion where particles detach {{near the top}} of the rotating drum as shown in Figure 9. Larger granules segregate near the inner surface due to the Brazil nut effect while smaller granules stay near the screen surface, thereby allowing smaller filter granules to pass through. This motion generates turbulent flow of particles, resulting in a higher screening efficiency compared <b>to</b> <b>slumping.</b>|$|R

It is surrounded by lunar mare that is dusted with ray material from Copernicus to the south.|$|R
50|$|This crater has a {{sharp-edged}} rim and {{an interior}} floor that is wider along the southeastern half, possibly due <b>to</b> <b>slumped</b> material or ejecta deposits.

Low ridges radiate from this crater rim across the floor to the northeast.|$|R
500|$|Through {{the summer}} siege, illness {{spread through the}} British camps. [...] In August, Wolfe himself was bedridden, causing already low morale <b>to</b> <b>slump</b> even further among the British troops. With many men in camp hospitals, British {{fighting}} numbers were thinned, and Wolfe personally felt that a new attack was needed {{by the end of}} September, or Britain's opportunity would be lost. In addition, his frustration with Montcalm's defensive stance continued to grow. In a letter to his mother, Wolfe wrote, [...] "The Marquis of Montcalm is {{at the head of a}} great number of bad soldiers, and I am at the head of a small number of good ones that wish for nothing so much as to fight him; but the wary old fellow avoids an action, doubtful of the behaviour of his army." [...] Montcalm also expressed frustration over the long siege, relating that he and his troops slept clothed and booted, and his horse was always saddled in preparation for an attack.|$|E
500|$|Burrell {{became the}} Phillies' longest tenured player in 2007 with the {{departure}} of Lieberthal via free agency. He hit only one home run in April but had a [...]292 batting average. On April 6, he homered and had four RBI (including the game-winner) in an 82 victory over Florida. He began <b>to</b> <b>slump</b> after April, batting [...]157 {{over the next two}} months. Once again, Manuel began benching him, using Greg Dobbs, Jayson Werth, or Michael Bourn in left field. On May 11, Burrell hit two home runs and had five RBI in a 72 victory over the Cubs. Werth was injured at the end of June, however, and Burrell reclaimed his starting job by batting [...]435 in July, with six home runs and 22 RBI. From July 1 {{through the end of the}} season, he batted [...]300 with 22 home runs and 65 RBI, starting the final 75 games of the season for the Phillies in left field. On July 14, he had four RBI in a 104 victory over St. Louis. Three days later, Burrell hit his 200th career home run in a 153 victory over the Dodgers. He had a 14-game hitting streak from July 22 to August 5, tying his career high. On August 17, in an 118 victory over the Pirates, Burrell got his 1,000th career hit, a two-run home run. At the end of August, the Phillies faced the Mets, whom they trailed in the NL East by six games, for a four-game series. In the first game of the series, on August 27, Burrell hit a game-winning two-run home run in a 92 victory. Two days later, in the third game of the series, he hit a solo home run and had a sacrifice fly (the game-winning RBI) against Óliver Pérez in a 32 victory. He hit two home runs in the fourth and final game of the series as the Phillies won 1110 to sweep the Mets. On September 21, his two-run home run against Shawn Hill provided the game-winning RBI in a 63 victory over Washington. Burrell finished the 2007 regular season batting [...]256 with 30 home runs, 97 RBI, and 114 walks (a career high) in 155 games. Burrell, Ryan Howard, and Jimmy Rollins became the second trio of Phillies with 30 or more home runs (and the first since 1929). On defense, he led major league outfielders in errors, with 10, and his [...]948 fielding percentage was the lowest among left fielders.|$|E
