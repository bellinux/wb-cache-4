The g-force {{effect on the}} human body also seemed to suggest the prospect of air-to-air combat between fighters was impractical anyway. The threat they saw related only to the return-fire of the bomber's gunners. Before the war the effectiveness of return, or cross-fire, from bombers had been exaggerated by the Air Staff and Air Ministry.|$|E
5|$|Domain-general {{views of}} {{vocabulary}} development argue that {{children do not}} need principles or constraints in order to successfully develop word-world mappings. Instead, word learning can be accounted for through general learning mechanisms such as salience, association, and frequency. Children are thought to notice the objects, actions, or events that are most salient in context, and then to associate them with the words that are most frequently used in their presence. Additionally, research on word learning suggests <b>that</b> <b>fast</b> mapping, the rapid learning that children display after a single exposure to new information, is not specific to word learning. Children can also successfully fast map when exposed to a novel fact, remembering both words and facts after a time delay.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} a chain {{reaction}} to occur, fissioning uranium atoms had to emit additional neutrons to keep the reaction going. At Columbia University in New York, Enrico Fermi, John Dunning, Herbert L. Anderson, Eugene T. Booth, G. Norris Glasoe, and Francis G. Slack conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States on 25 January 1939. Subsequent work confirmed <b>that</b> <b>fast</b> neutrons were indeed produced by fission. Szilard obtained permission {{from the head of}} the Physics Department at Columbia, George B. Pegram, to use a laboratory for three months, and persuaded Walter Zinn to become his collaborator. They conducted a simple experiment on the seventh floor of Pupin Hall at Columbia, using a radium-beryllium source to bombard uranium with neutrons. They discovered significant neutron multiplication in natural uranium, proving that a chain reaction might be possible.|$|E

5|$|Wisden {{believed}} that Jardine's effective batting technique meant <b>that</b> <b>fast</b> bowlers troubled him less than other batsmen. He did have difficulties {{with a few}} bowlers. Alec Kennedy, a medium paced inswing bowler, took Jardine's wicket eleven times, eight of these occasions before the batsman had scored 20 runs. Kennedy found that Jardine had slightly slow footwork, often bowling him or trapping him lbw. Bert Ironmonger also troubled Jardine, taking his wicket {{in five of the}} eleven Test innings in which they faced each other. Jardine displayed a slight weakness against Australian slow bowlers, not moving his feet well enough against them. In 16 Test innings in Australia, he was out to slow bowlers ten times, but he rarely experienced similar difficulties against English spinners. One other bowler to cause Jardine problems was the Australian paceman Tim Wall, who took his wicket five times on the nine occasions he bowled to him.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lengthy}} design process, the ships {{proved to be}} {{failures}} in service, primarily {{as a result of}} their low speed. Intended to reach a speed of at least , none of the vessels were able to steam <b>that</b> <b>fast.</b> The changes made to Sebenico during construction were meant to address the problem, but she was unable to reach her design speed either. As a result, they saw very little active service, spending much of their careers in reserve. By the 1890s, they were reactivated for training ship duties, and in 1897 Sebenico took part in an international naval demonstration off Crete, where she sank a Greek blockade runner. Training ship duties continued through the early 1910s. During World War I, all three vessels were used as guard ships, but none saw action. After the war, they were seized as war prizes by the Allies and awarded to Italy in 1920; all were broken up immediately thereafter.|$|E

50|$|Researchers {{have argued}} that the IAT may measure {{salience}} of concepts rather than associations. Whereas IAT proponents claim <b>that</b> <b>faster</b> response times when pairing concepts indicate stronger associations, critics claim <b>that</b> <b>faster</b> response times indicate that concepts are similar in salience (and slower response times indicate that concepts differ in salience). There is some support for this claim. For example, in an old-young IAT, old faces would be more salient than young faces. As a result, researchers created an old-young IAT that involved pairing young and old faces with neutral words (non-salient attribute) and non-words (salient attribute). Response times were faster when old faces (salient) were paired with non-words (salient) than when old faces (salient) were paired with neutral words (non-salient), supporting the assertion <b>that</b> <b>faster</b> response time can be facilitated by matching salience.|$|R

It also fought with success during the Battle of France and losses were relatively light, although when facing modern fighters like the Hawker Hurricane, the bomber proved slow in comparison and more vulnerable.

25|$|There is {{an unspoken}} agreement, {{particularly}} in the time before {{the widespread use of}} batting helmets, <b>that</b> <b>fast</b> bowlers will not bowl bouncers at each other, because less skilled batsmen are less likely to effectively defend and therefore more likely to be struck.

25|$|Lawrence Cook {{emerged in}} 1907 as a bowler of fast-medium pace, {{possibly}} meant {{to substitute for}} Walter Brearley who was then engaged {{in one of his}} many disputes with the Lancashire committee. Although he took a wicket with his first ball in first-class cricket, on the whole his record for that season was moderate, but with seven wickets on a rare hard pitch against Kent at Canterbury he showed he had great persistence. When Brearley came back into the eleven in 1908, Cook was relegated to the Second Eleven, but in 1910 he re-established in place and in the May following year, helped by a bad pitch and feeble Northamptonshire batting, he bowled with considerable pace and a lot of spin to take eight wickets for 39 runs. Cook indeed bowled so well early that season that Lancashire seemed to have found an excellent pace bowler when Brearley could not play. However, he was felt impossible to fit in when <b>that</b> <b>fast</b> bowler was free from business and on returning to the side he did not maintain his early season form, nor did he do anything of note against the top counties.|$|E
