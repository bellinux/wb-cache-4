40|$|Ocean sunfishes, {{with their}} {{peculiar}} morphology, large size, and surface habits, are valuable assets in ecotourism destinations worldwide. This study investigates site fidelity and long-range movements of short ocean sunfish, Mola ramsayi (Giglioli 1883), at Punta Vicente Roca (PVR) off Isabela Island in the Galapagos Islands. Five individuals were tracked between 32 and 733 days using ultrasonic receivers and transmitters. Two of the 5 were also tracked with towed pop-off satellite tags. One travelled to the equatorial front covering 2700 [*]km in 53 days, with dive depths {{in the upper}} 360 [*]m at temperatures between 9. 2 °C and 22 °C. During its westward travel, dives extended to 1112 [*]m (the deepest depth yet recorded for Molidae) into temperatures ranging between 4. 5 °C and 23. 2 °C. The remaining four individuals demonstrated site fidelity to PVR and were detected at the site between 128 – 1361 times {{for a total of}} 3557 reports. Forty-eight percent of the reports occurred during daytime hours and 52 % after dark. Presumed cleaning session durations had a median of 15 minutes and a maximum of nearly 100 minutes. No other ultrasonic arrays around Galapagos or in the Eastern Pacific regional network recorded the presence of tagged individuals.

40|$|The {{dusky dolphin}} (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) {{is a small}} delphinid that occurs in {{temperate}} waters near Southern Hemisphere land masses. Off Kaikoura, New Zealand, duskies are targeted for interactions by <b>tourist</b> <b>vessels,</b> swimmers and recreational vessels. To determine if human activity influenced dolphin behavior, I conducted shore- and vessel-based studies to examine movement patterns and acoustic behavior of duskies during three field seasons. Small groups of 25 or fewer dolphins were tracked from shore with a theodolite. Three variables; mean leg speed, linearity, and reorientation rate, were examined to determine possible influence of year, season, presence of a calf, time of day, group size, or presence of vessels within 100 m, 101 - 300 m and 301 - 1, 000 m. Mean leg speeds {{did not differ significantly}} by year, season, presence of a calf, or time of day. For group size comparisons, a post-hoc linear regression found a significant relationship between mean leg speeds and group size (p= 0. 0472). Mean speeds for groups containing 6 - 10, 11 - 15, and 16 - 20 animals increased as group sizes increased. Mean leg speeds did not differ by presence of a vessel within 100 m, 101 - 300 m, or 300 - 1, 000 m. For shore-based studies, mean leg spee...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTAvailability of {{economic}} and efficient energy resources is crucial to a nation's development. Because of their low cost and advancement in drilling and exploration technologies, oil and gas based energy systems are {{the most widely used}} energy source throughout the world. The inexpensive oil and gas based energy systems are used for everything, i. e., from transportation of goods and people to the harvesting of crops for food. As the energy demand continues to rise, there is strong need for inexpensive energy solutions. An offshore platform is a large structure that is used to house workers and machinery needed to drill wells in the ocean bed, extract oil and/or natural gas, process the produced fluids, and ship or pipe them to shore. Depending on the circumstances, the offshore platform can be fixed (to the ocean floor) or can consist of an artificial island or can float. Semi-submersibles are used for various purposes in offshore and marine engineering, e. g. crane <b>vessels,</b> drilling <b>vessels,</b> <b>tourist</b> <b>vessels,</b> production platforms and accommodation facilities, etc. The challenges of deepwater drilling have further motivated the researchers to design optimum choices for semi-submersibles for a chosen operating depth. In our series of eight papers, we discuss the design and production aspects of all the types of offshore platforms. In the present part I, we present an introduction and critical analysis of semi-submersibles...|$|R
40|$|Alien species, one of {{the biggest}} threats to natural {{ecosystems}} worldwide, are of particular concern for oceanic archipelagos such as Galápagos. To enable more effective management of alien species, we reviewed, collated and analysed all available records of alien species for Galápagos. We also assembled a comprehensive dataset on pathways to and among the Galápagos Islands, including tourist and resident numbers, <b>tourist</b> <b>vessels,</b> their itineraries and visitation sites, aircraft capacity and occupancy, air and sea cargo and biosecurity interceptions. So far, 1, 579 alien terrestrial and marine species have been introduced to Galápagos by humans. Of these, 1, 476 have become established. Almost half of these were intentional introductions, mostly of plants. Most unintentional introductions arrived on plants and plant associated material, followed by transport vehicles, and commodities (in particular fruit and vegetables). The number, frequency and geographic origin of pathways for the arrival and dispersal of alien species to and within Galápagos have increased over time, tracking closely the increase in human population (residents and tourists) on the islands. Intentional introductions of alien species should decline as biosecurity is strengthened but there is a danger that unintentional introductions will increase further as tourism on Galápagos expands. This unique world heritage site will only retain its biodiversity values if the pathways for invasion are managed effectively...|$|R
