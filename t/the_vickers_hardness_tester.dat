When the loading was O. lkgf, 0. 2 kgf and 0. 3 kgf, only the radical cracking can be observed and the cracking was not obvious at Si and SiC mixed phase. Avalanche crushed phenomenon occurred when the load increased to 0. 4 kgf. According to the Evans’ fracture toughness formula, the fracture toughness of SiC phase is about 2. 5 MPam 1 / 2, and the fracture toughness of Si-SiC mixed phase is bigger than 3. 0 MPam 1 / 2.

The Fe 41 Co 7 -xNixCr 15 Mo 14 C 15 B 6 Y 2 (x= 0, 1, 3, 5) metallic glasses were fabricated by copper mold casting method. The thermal stability and crystallization behavior of the metallic glass rods were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and isothermal experiments.

It is shown that the addition of Ni does not play a positive role for enlarging ΔTx and GFA from parameter γ (=Tx/(Tg+Tl)), and it can, however, increase the activation energy in the initial stage of crystallization by changing the initial crystallization behavior. The minor addition of Ni can refine the crystal grain obtained from the full crystallization experiment. The primary crystallization causes the decrease of hardness in these alloys, and as the crystallization continues, the hardness in all samples increases instead due to the precipitation of carbide and boride. The annealing temperature has an obvious effect on magnetic properties of these alloys, and the minor addition of Ni can effectively prevent the alloy annealed at high temperature to transform from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic state...|$|E

Materials and Methods: The sample size for the study was 100. Each specimen consisted of a longitudinally sectioned half of a root of a single-rooted tooth which was embedded in acrylic resin. The prepared specimens were divided randomly into five groups of twenty specimens each. Each group was treated with the irrigants to be tested. Group I was the control - the specimens were treated with distilled water. The specimens in Group II were treated with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) followed by EDTA. Specimens in Group III were treated with NaOCl followed by CHX. Specimens in Group IV were treated with NaOCl followed by HEBP, and specimens in Group V were treated with NaOCl followed by propolis. Following this, all the specimens were placed on <b>the</b> <b>Vickers</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>tester</b> and three readings were taken for each specimen.

Introduction. Recently, Nonlinear opitcal material plays an impartant role in the photonics and optoelectronics. New nonlinear optical (NLO) frequency conversion mateirals {{have a significant impact on}} laser technology, optical datastorage and telecommunications. The past few decates, a new series of hybrid nonlinear optical crystal based on polymeric cadmium-thiyocyante anions and complex cations [1 - 3] have received wide attention due to their good optical and interesting physical properties such as thermal, mechanical and second harmonic generation effects. Renewed attention has been received recently for the polymer, inorganic and organic, materials. IPOS series, thiocyanate (SCN) ligand forms a coordination polymeric chain combined with the d 10 transition metal ion and leads a non-centrosymmetric structure. A novel series of coordination solids explained as IPOS with the general formula [H-G] [M-L], where the inorganic anion [M]-is ligand (L) coordination polymer such as [Cd(SCN) 3] ∞ and the organic cation [H-G] + is a host (H) -guest (G) complex such as [(crown ether) -(alkali metl) ]. Earlier scientists and researchers [4] reported the growth of a novel hybrid nonlinear optical compound [(18 C 6) K][Cd(SCN) 3], which is wide optically transparent from 220 to 3, 300 nm and exhibits efficient SHG. Based on the design theory, attempts were made to combine 18 -crown- 6 ether (18 C 6) and thiocyanate ligands with the transition metal ion Cd 2 + and the alkali metal ion NH 4 +.

High entropy alloys are defined as solid-solution alloys with 5 or more principal elements in equal or nearly equal atomic fractions with the elemental concentrations ranging from 5 – 35 at%. This new class of materials {{are considered to be}} potential alternatives to the conventional materials which are currently being used in the different fields such as structural, nuclear, automotive and aerospace industries. In this study, the determination of phases and microstructural properties of FeNiCrCo and FeNiCrCoAl high entropy alloys with nearly equi-atomic concentrations and their influence on the hardness of the material after undergoing different thermo-mechanical treatments was studied. The combination of different techniques such as, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and Electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) were used to determine the phases present in the alloy systems for different experimental conditions.

This plastic is regularly used for food containers because it needs to be dishwasher safe. Although the thermoforming process has been developed for over two decades but there are still some unsolved problems found in this technology. In the development commercial polypropylene grades, there are several critical problems addressed such as sheet quality, part uniformity and wall thickness, regrind use and dimensional stability. This project starts with searching various types of journal that related to the topic of designing and fabricating thermoplastic container using polypropylene (PP) sheet via thermoforming process. Read and understand all the journals are the element in the effort to make this project. This study aims to design and fabricate plastic container using polypropylene (PP) sheet with thickness 1 mm via thermoforming process. CATIA P 3 V 5 R 21 software by Dassault Systemes was used to design the plastic container and its mould. Design consideration for the plastic product and its mould is important as to reduce the defects. For example fillet was added to avoid sharp edge. Draft angle also was used at the wall side of mould which is to ease the process of absorption. Round shape plastic container was selected to be design as it has smooth shape that allows the pliable polypropylene sheet to form according to the shape of the mould. An aluminum block with dimension 100 mm x 100 mm x 50 mm was used as the female cavity been cut using band saw machine. The aluminum blocks was machined using Makino KE 55 CNC Milling Machine located at the Machining Laboratory. High Speed Drilling machine was used to drill the hole {{at the bottom of the}} female mould. 1 mm and 6 mm diameter of drill bits was used to make the holes at the bottom of aluminum mould. Moreover, this project studies the effect of thermoforming temperature and number of mould vent hole to 1 mm PP sheet. Two types of vent holes used on the aluminum mould which are 1 vent and 5 vent holes. There were two parameters used to fabricate polypropylene plastic container. The first parameter is the different degree of temperature used to heat the 1 mm polypropylene plastic sheet. The degree of temperature used is 160 °C, 165 °C, 170 °C, and 175 °C. The second parameter that was used is different number of vent holes on the mould to fabricate the plastic container.

Lotus-type porous {{aluminum}} with cylindrical pores oriented in {{one direction}} was deformed by Equal Channel Angular Extrusion (ECAE) through a 150 ° die with sequential 180 ° rotations, and the pore morphology and <b>Vickers</b> <b>hardness</b> after <b>the</b> extrusion were investigated. <b>The</b> <b>Vickers</b> <b>hardness</b> increases with increasing number of passes in the extrusions both parallel and perpendicular to the pore direction, accompanied by the decrease of porosity. The densification occurs more easily in the perpendicular extrusions than in the parallel extrusions, and the large deformation by the densification {{gives rise to the}} large increase in <b>the</b> <b>Vickers</b> <b>hardness</b> for <b>the</b> perpendicular extrusions...|$|R
30|$|A Tukon™ 1102 / 1202 <b>Vickers</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>tester</b> {{is applied}} to measure the HV hardness. In the experiment, a force of 9.8  N {{is applied to}} press the diamond probe into the samples, and the force is {{maintained}} for 15  s. Finally, the HV of the materials can be reflected {{by the size of}} the surface indentation. To obtain the average hardness, five different locations on each NPB are selected to measure the HV. The relative error of the HV is less than 8.3 %. The randomness of the testing locations should be responsible for this deviation.|$|R

30|$|The {{morphology}} {{and structural}} investigation were performed by {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM, JSM 6335 F FEG and JEOL JSM- 820, Akishima-shi, Tokyo, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, CM 20). Thermal conductivities of as-fabricated samples were measured by DZDR-S thermal conductivity tester, which utilizes the transient plane source method. A plane sensor was sandwiched by two pieces of specimens with flat surface and thermal conductivity on the vertical direction perpendicular to the testing plane can be read from the screen directly. The density and hardness of the material were measured successively, by electronic densimeter (MD- 300 S) and <b>Vickers</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>tester</b> (FV- 700), respectively.|$|R
