5|$|Mammillaria species tend to grow low <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> solitary or grouped in clusters. The genus {{is marked}} by its dimorphic areoles: the spine bearing, or vegetative, areoles are located on {{the apex of the}} tubercle, and {{flowering}} areoles are located inside the axils of the tubercles. The stem is woolly and covered with bristles.|$|E
5|$|Princeton University {{built the}} chapel {{to replace the}} Marquand Chapel, which stood between where the present chapel and McCosh Hall stand until it burned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> 1920. The {{location}} for the new chapel was chosen for two reasons: symbolically, the new chapel would rise {{from the ashes of}} the old one, and practically, it would locate the new chapel centrally as the campus expanded eastward.|$|E
5|$|At the mansion, Mona knocks Max <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> {{an attempt}} to follow her orders to kill him, but discovers that her {{feelings}} for him keep her from doing so. Lem then shoots Mona, after realizing that she will not kill Max. Woden confronts Lem, who shoots him {{to death in the}} ensuing struggle. Max and Lem then fight while the mansion burns around them. Eventually, Lem is killed and Max returns to Mona's side as the police arrive, and she dies in his arms. In an alternate ending unlocked on the highest difficulty, Mona survives her wound, and the two share a kiss.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{conflicting}} {{conclusions of the}} first two, a third post-mortem was conducted on 22 April by Kenneth Shorrock {{on behalf of the}} Metropolitan police, and Ben Swift on behalf of Simon Harwood. Shorrock and Swift agreed with the results of the second autopsy. The Met's point of contact for Tomlinson's death, Detective Inspector Eddie Hall, told the pathologists before the final post-mortem that Tomlinson had fallen <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> front of a police van earlier in the evening, although {{there was no evidence that}} this had happened. The IPCC ruled in May 2011 that Hall had been reckless in making this claim, but had not intended to mislead.|$|E
5|$|Bee-eaters {{are fairly}} {{indiscriminate}} in {{their choice of}} habitat. Their requirements are simply an elevated perch from which to watch for prey and a suitable ground substrate in which to dig their breeding burrow. Because their prey is entirely caught on the wing they are not dependent on any vegetation type. A single species, the blue-headed bee-eater, is found inside closed rainforest where it forages close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> poor light in the gaps between large trees. Six other species are also closely associated with rainforest, but occur in edge habitat such as along rivers, in tree-fall gaps, off trees overhanging ravines or on emergent tree crowns above the main canopy.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{made his}} mixed martial arts debut on January 1, 1998 at Joe Gaytia's JKD Challenge. He slammed his {{opponent}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> just fifteen seconds, winning via KO. The slam became his signature move. He won his next fight via submission due to strikes. Hughes fought three times at Extreme Challenge 21, on October 17, 1998 defeating Victor Hunsaker via TKO and future UFC Midleweight Champion Dave Menne via unanimous decision. In the third fight {{of that night}} he lost to then-undefeated Dennis Hallman by technical submission (guillotine choke) at 0:17 of the first round. The result was announced as a KO. In the process, Hallman handed Hughes his first professional defeat.|$|E

5|$|In May 2011 the IPCC {{released}} three reports into Tomlinson's death, written between April 2010 and May 2011. The main report contained material revealed {{during the}} inquest. The third report detailed an allegation from Tomlinson's family {{that the police}} had offered misleading information to the pathologists before the third autopsy on 22 April 2009. The Met's point of contact for Tomlinson's death, Detective Inspector Eddie Hall, had told the pathologists that Tomlinson had fallen <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> front of a police van earlier in the evening, although there was no evidence to support this. The IPCC ruled that Hall had been reckless in making this claim, but had not intended to mislead the pathologists.|$|E
5|$|In the 22ndminute, a lofted through-pass from Carrick found Rooney on {{the left}} wing, but the Liverpudlian's cross was blocked by Touré and {{went out for a}} corner kick. The corner, taken by Giggs, found Ronaldo, but the Portuguese got too far under the ball and headed over. Precise passing from the Barcelona midfield got the Catalans moving upfield until a {{shoulder}} charge from Anderson sent Iniesta stumbling <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> the inside-left channel 30yards from goal. The consequent free kick was taken by Xavi, who sent the ball just wide of the near post. Another free kick followed, as Messi was bundled over by a double-challenge from Vidić and Carrick, but it came to nothing.|$|E
5|$|In west Serbia's {{region of}} Rađevina, {{centered}} on the town of Krupanj, the badnjak prepared for each household is cut into three logs, {{the most important of}} which is the dozemak—the log that comes from the part of the trunk that grew nearest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>In</b> Resava, Levač, Temnić, and Jadar of Serbia, as well as in Ozren and Romanija of Bosnia, the badnjak is cut into three logs associated respectively with the men, the women, and the children.|$|E

5|$|Nearly razed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> 1960 {{along with}} other {{buildings}} on Lafayette Square, successful lobbying and support from the newly elected Kennedy administration in 1961 led to the original proposals to gut the building being dropped. First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy was instrumental in persuading architect John Carl Warnecke, a friend of her husband, to create a design that would incorporate the new buildings with the old, based on the architectural theory of contextualism. The Cutts-Madison House, Cosmos Club building, and Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House were joined, and a courtyard built {{between them and the}} National Courts building. The building has remained part of the National Courts Building complex ever since, and is now protected by the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass {{returns to}} the Rocket Group, where Leo has reconstructed the meteorite, which can carry ammonia and other gases and travel through the {{atmosphere}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> one piece. In London, the Metropolitan Police claim they have no jurisdiction over the matter, so he goes to his contact Fowler at the ministry, who reveals that the plant is a top secret project to make synthetic food, but Vincent Broadhead MP, who is conducting an inquiry into the project, reveals that there are identical plants in Brazil and Siberia. Upon gaining entry to the inquiry, Quatermass notices {{that one of the}} civil servants has 'the mark'.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg {{retreated from}} the area to fight off an Ottoman invasion. Before leaving, he garrisoned the fort of Baleč (Balsha) near Dagnum, {{under the command of}} Marin Spani. Andrea Venier ordered the capture of Baleci after Skanderbeg had left, forcing Marin Spani to {{evacuate}} it. Venier then burned it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>In</b> retaliation, Hamza Kastrioti, one of Spani's colleagues, attacked a nearby Venetian fortress with what little men he had, but was defeated.|$|E

5|$|The Jugendstil, {{a variant}} of Art Nouveau, had a certain {{influence}} on {{much of the new}} construction in Norway {{around the turn of the}} 20th century. The city of Ålesund, after burning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> 1904, was rebuilt almost entirely in this style and continues to be a prominent example, along with Riga and Brussels. Trondheim also has numerous art nouveau buildings. In the capital Oslo, few art nouveau buildings were erected, due to a local economic crisis and a stagnant building trade during the first decade of the century. However, some public buildings were constructed in this style, such as the Historical Museum and the Government office building. In Bergen, the main theatre Den Nationale Scene is a monumental example.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} transept {{is named}} for Henry Gurdon Marquand, the benefactor of the Marquand Chapel, which burned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> 1920 and which the present chapel was built to replace. An American flag flown by the USS Princeton hangs from the transept's north wall. The southern transept {{is named for}} Chester Alwyn Braman, the first donor to the University Chapel Fund. A staircase leads from the Braman Transept to the Bright Pulpit.|$|E
5|$|The risk {{of civil}} {{conflict}} continued, however, and Parliament {{decided that it}} was necessary to slight, or damage so as to put beyond military use, the castle in 1652, as it remained a surprisingly powerful fortress and a continuing threat should any fresh uprising occur. The castle was virtually razed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> the operation, although a brick building continued {{to be used as a}} prison into the 18th century. A large house was built in the bailey in 1700, followed by a gothic mansion house on the same site in 1837.|$|E

5|$|When cats become aggressive, {{they try}} to make {{themselves}} appear larger and more threatening by raising their fur, arching their backs, turning sideways and hissing or spitting. Often, the ears are pointed down and back to avoid damage to the inner ear and potentially listen for any changes behind them while focused forward. They may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponent. Fights usually consist of grappling and delivering powerful slaps to the face and body with the forepaws as well as bites. Cats also throw themselves <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> a defensive posture to rake their opponent's belly with their powerful hind legs.|$|E
5|$|All swifts feed on insects {{caught in}} flight, and the Pacific swift has been {{recorded}} as consuming bees, wasps, termites, moths and flies. A Chinese study found that it caught {{a wide variety of}} insect prey and considered that most of the species eaten were harmful to agriculture or forestry. The Pacific swift tends to hunt higher than sympatric swifts, sharing its airspace mainly with white-throated needletails. It typically feeds at heights up to , only flying close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> poor weather. It often forages near low-pressure areas, which serve both to raise insects from the ground and to give the swifts additional lift. The swifts circle through the insect swarms in flocks typically of tens or hundreds of birds, although sometimes reaching tens of thousands in Australia. In Siberia, Pacific swifts feed at dusk to much later hours than the common swift, sometimes until midnight, and migrants have been seen flying with bats in the Philippines. The young are brought balls of insects bound with saliva. In bad weather, they are sometimes not fed for days, surviving on stored body fat.|$|E
5|$|All three text-based games {{require the}} player {{to control a}} rocket {{attempting}} {{to land on the}} moon by entering instructions to the rocket in a turn-based system in response to the textual summary of its current position and velocity relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>In</b> the original Lunar, players controlled only the amount of vertical thrust to apply, based on their current vertical velocity and remaining fuel, with each round representing one second of travel time. Rocket added a simple text-based graphical display of the distance from the ground in each round, while LEM added horizontal velocity and the ability to apply thrust at an angle. In 1970 and 1971, DEC employee and editor of the newsletter David H. Ahl converted two early mainframe games, Lunar and Hamurabi, from the FOCAL language to BASIC, partially as a demonstration of the language on the DEC PDP-8 minicomputer. Their popularity led him to start printing BASIC games in the DEC newsletter, both his own and reader submissions.|$|E
