[...] Weinberg's own experimentation since the Darkness days had also led to a more reverberant sound. Overall, Weinberg's more fluid drumming combined with Roy Bittan's use of synthesizers and better overall production to give Springsteen a more modern sound, resulting in the album becoming Springsteen's best-selling one ever and spawning a record-tying seven Top 10 hit singles. Springsteen later said of the album, [...] "Max {{was the best thing}} on the record." [...] Weinberg's most well-known drum part came on [...] "Born in the U.S.A.", where his snare drum paired against Bittan's signature synthesizer riff on the opening and throughout {{the main part of the}} song.

[...] Upon the restart, intentional drum breakdowns matched bass swoops and guitar feedback; Springsteen subsequently said of the performance overall, [...] "You can hear Max – to me, he was right up there with <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> on that song."
