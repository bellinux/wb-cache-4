40|$|Today’s {{market of}} Power Amplifiers (PAs) offers both PAs {{stand-alone}} and PA modules (PA plus PA Controller, PAC, integrated {{in the same}} module). PA modules do not require an on-chip PAC but simply an Automatic Power Control (APC) able to shape the transmission (<b>TX)</b> <b>burst</b> for the PAC within the PA module. In order to maximize {{the flexibility of the}} on-chip PA’s control system, the design of programmable and versatile architectures suitable to interface both the solutions becomes then an attractive approach. This paper presents a versatile CMOS APC/PAC module which can interface most of the PAs and PA modules on the market. Two programmable operating modes can be selected: 1. PAC Mode (to interface PAs stand-alone); 2. APC Mode (to interface PA modules). The proposed architecture allows to optimize the area and save power consumption by reducing the number of operational amplifiers required by a standard approach with APC and PAC separated. The APC/PAC module features 0. 6 mm 2 in...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{apparatus}} and method of linearization of a digitally controlled pre-power amplifier (DPA) and RF power ampli-fier (PA). The mechanism {{is operative to}} perform predistor-tion calibration to compensate for nonlinearities in the DPA and PA circuits. A predistortion look up table (LUT) stores measured distortion compensation data that {{is applied to the}} TX data before being input to the digital to frequency converter (DFC), DPA and PA. The mechanism of the invention takes advantage of the on-chip receiver, which is normally inactive during the <b>TX</b> <b>burst</b> in a half-duplex operation, to demodulate the RF PA output and use the digital I/Q RX outputs to perform calibration of the TX pre-distortion tables. Controlled RF coupling is used to provide a sample of the RF output signal that to the receiver chain. The contents of the predistortion LUT are typically updated during the PA power up or down ramp. While the digitally-controlled PA (DPA) code is increasing (or decreas-ing), the amplitude and phase of the recovered I/Q samples are used to determine the instantaneous value ofthe AMIAM and AMiPM pre-distortion from which an update to the predistortion tables may be computed.

40|$|Broadband {{wireless}} channels {{observed at}} a receiver cannot fully exhibit dense nature {{in a low}} to moderate signalto- noise ratio (SNR) regime, if the channels follow a typical propagation scenario such as Vehicular-A or Pedestrian-B. It is hence expected that ℓ 1 regularized channel estimation methods can improve channel estimation performance in the broadband wireless channels. However, it is well-known that the ℓ 2 multiburst (MB) channel estimation achieves the Cram´er-Rao bound (CRB) asymptotically. This is because the ℓ 2 MB technique formulated as a {{minimum mean square error}} (MMSE) problem improves the mean squared error (MSE) performance by utilizing the subspace projection. Performance analysis shows that ℓ 1 regularized channel estimation does not improve the MSE performance significantly over the ℓ 2 MB technique so far as the subspace channel model assumption is correct. We demonstrate, however, a receiver with ℓ 1 regularized channel estimation can improve bit error rate (BER) performance if the assumption is not always correct. For this purpose, we focus on intermittent transmission (TX) scenario which is defined as a generalized TX sequence having arbitrary length interruption between two continuous <b>TX</b> <b>bursts.</b> A receiver with the ℓ 2 MB method suffers from BER deterioration in an intermittent TX scenario having abrupt channel changes. As a solution to the problem, we propose a new algorithm which is a hybrid of ℓ 1 regularized least square (LS) and ℓ 2 MMSE channel estimation techniques. Simulation results show that the receiver with the proposed algorithm achieves a significant BER gain over that of the ℓ 2 MB technique in the intermittent TX scenario...|$|R
