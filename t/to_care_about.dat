5|$|Richard Romanus as Vinnie Genzianna, {{leader of}} the Stompers. A cool, stylish young man. Though he {{definitely}} has his problems, he does seem <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> those he is close to and at least tries {{to be strong and}} respectful.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} were similarly well received. Bob Mackey of 1UP.com and Martin Robinson of Eurogamer called them believable and {{easy for the}} player <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>about.</b> IGN's Lucas M. Thomas was satisfied by development of each character, while Mike Manson of Nintendo Life considered each characters' motives to be unique and interesting. In contrast, Boosinger found the characters to be uncompelling and poorly written, and believed {{that there was little}} reason to care for them until their backstories were revealed.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} reasons for showing Oscar's head and {{shoulders}} within the frame during the flashback scenes, rather than letting the camera be the character's eyes. The first was {{that this is the}} way Noé usually sees himself in dreams and when recalling past events. He also thought it would be easier for the viewer <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> a character who is visible, as many point-of-view films, in his opinion, look unintentionally funny.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, he {{maintained}} no official political affiliations but continued <b>to</b> <b>care</b> deeply <b>about</b> issues of Armenian national identity.|$|R

5000|$|Pomo (The Boss) and VTJ (The Vice President) are {{representatives of}} the management. They seem <b>to</b> <b>care</b> only <b>about</b> money and treat {{employees}} as expendable.|$|R
5|$|When {{the issue}} of secession reached a crisis, Cleburne sided with the Southern states. His choice was not due to any love of slavery, which he claimed not <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>about,</b> but out of affection for the Southern people who had adopted {{him as one of}} their own. As the crisis mounted, Cleburne joined the local militia company (the Yell Rifles) as a private soldier. He was soon elected captain. He led the company in the seizure of the U.S. Arsenal in Little Rock in January 1861. When Arkansas left the Union, the Yell Rifles became part of the 1st Arkansas Infantry, later {{designated}} the 15th Arkansas, of which he was elected Colonel. He was promoted to brigadier general on March 4, 1862.|$|E
5|$|Trevor is {{depicted}} as a sociopath in Grand Theft Auto V. He is relentless and easily kills without remorse. However, he is honest about everything and rarely shows hypocrisy, which he often points out in others. He appears to be very insecure about {{having grown up in}} Canada, and takes offence to people mocking his accent. Despite his sociopathic actions, Trevor is very emotional; he seems <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> people very close to him, and he can be truly loyal to them. These people include his mother, Ashley Butler, Patricia Madrazo, Maude, Michael De Santa and his children Tracey and Jimmy, Lamar Davis, Ron, Lester, Wade and Franklin Clinton. Nevertheless, the other characters regard Trevor as dangerously unstable; during the prologue, Michael leads Trevor into a trap where he is supposed to be shot and killed, and later implores Franklin to plead insanity if he is ever arrested with Trevor. It is implied that the knowledge and extent of Trevor's crimes, the belief that Trevor's depravity escalated without anyone to keep him in check and his silence on the matter all weigh heavily on Michael's conscience.|$|E
25|$|The main {{characters}} {{of the show is}} the Simpsons family. The Simpsons are a family who live in at 742 Evergreen Terrace in Springfield. Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> one another.|$|E

25|$|These three {{components}} make up nature connectedness and {{are required for}} a healthy relationship with nature. If an individual feels connected to nature (possibly by spending time in it), {{they may be more}} inclined <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> nature, and protect the environment. Recent research has found that nature exposure (and feeling connected to nature at a trait level) provides many benefits to humans such as well-being.|$|E
25|$|Self-objectification can {{increase}} in situations which heighten {{the awareness of}} an individual’s physical appearance. Here, {{the presence of a}} third person observer is enhanced. Therefore, when individuals know others are looking at them, or will be looking at them, they are more likely <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> their physical appearance. Examples of the enhanced presence of an observer include the presence of an audience, camera, or other known observer.|$|E
25|$|Drachma: A 55-year-old man {{who lost}} his right arm, right eye, and only son while {{fighting}} the giant arc-whale Rhaknam. His obsession with hunting Rhaknam for revenge leads him to search the skies on his small fishing airship, Little Jack. He travels with Vyse and the others {{for part of the}} game, and pretends not <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> them, but he shows up to save them quite a few times. He use a mechanical right arm as a weapon during battle.|$|E

25|$|Esperanto {{has some}} slang {{in the sense}} of in-group talk as well. Some of this is borrowed; for example, fajfi priio (to whistle about something) means not <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> it, as in German. Other {{expressions}} deriving from Esperanto history or dealing with specifically Esperantist concerns have arisen over the years. A volapukaĵo, for example, is something needlessly incomprehensible, derived from the name of the more complex and less immediately readable constructed language Volapük, which preceded Esperanto by a few years and was replaced by it.|$|E
25|$|People may compete over {{getting the}} {{benefits}} of a high reputation which may cause competitive altruism. On the other hand, in some experiments a proportion of people do not seem <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> reputation and they do not help more even if this is conspicuous. This may possibly be due to reasons such as psychopathy or that they are so attractive that they need not be seen to be altruistic. The reputational benefits of altruism occur in the future as compared to the immediate costs of altruism in the present. While humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costs/benefits as compared to those in the present, some have shorter time horizons than others and these people tend to be less cooperative.|$|E
25|$|Zoey came to {{live with}} the Mileses shortly after she was born. Zoey's mother, a captive-bred {{orangutan}} named Lucky, didn't know how to care for her new baby, having never seen it done in the wild. As a result, little Zoey had to be placed in the care of Mrs. Miles, a primatologist at the zoo, and the only character with the time and patience to be Zoey's foster parent. Molly tries her hardest {{to get used to the}} new family member, even making Zoey her current-events project for school, but after having her homework destroyed and her mother's time taken up by the baby orangutan she gives up and begins desperately wanting things to be normal again. After Zoey ingests a bottle of shampoo and has to be rushed to the hospital, Molly learns what it truly means to be a big sister and <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> Zoey, no matter how much trouble she causes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I mean,' said Jonas, stooping {{down over}} the body, 'that I never heard you were his father, or had any {{particular}} reason <b>to</b> <b>care</b> much <b>about</b> him. Halloa. Hold up there!' ...|$|R

25|$|Long-term {{decreasing}} {{rates in}} fertility and increasing life expectancy could have damaging consequences for almost every European nation. One consequence of ageing might be lower inflation rates as elderly {{people are more}} inflation averse and have sufficient political power for governments <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> their preferences. These demographic trends provoked debate over the best policies that can reverse these trends and lessen their consequences. RAND Europe, an independent not-for-profit research institute, was able to collect these policies through research and analysis. There were three broad policy approaches that were generated from the debate. The first policy is to encourage childbearing among younger couples that involves marriage and cohabitation. The second policy states {{that there should be}} an increase in the immigration of working-age people. Thirdly, there should be an improvement of social policy in general, to mitigate negative consequences of these trends. The research intends {{to examine the relationship between}} demographic trends and European government policies and determine which policies can reduce the consequences of low fertility and population ageing.|$|E
25|$|Sharon {{encourages}} Michelle to {{make amends}} with Martin and Ian, but neither of them are interested; Michelle talks to Bex, who says Michelle let herself down and the old Michelle that Bex used {{to look up to}} would hate this Michelle, and that she ruined everything she worked for; Michelle cries in Sharon's arms, saying she no longer knows herself. Ian eventually forgives Michelle but Martin still refuses to speak to her. Michelle attempts to find work in schools, without any luck. Stacey invites Michelle to a family meal but Martin says Michelle is only pretending <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> her family, and tells her that she is not the big sister he used to look up to. Michelle starts community service and hears that Tim wants a divorce, and she tries to avoid the issue. Eventually, Martin and Michelle start to talk again but he is still angry that she has behaved like a teenager. Michelle then realises that she needs to apply for other jobs so enquires about a sales assistant job, which she successfully obtains. Whilst travelling to work Michelle meets Tom Bailey (Daniel Casey) on the tube and she eventually gets the courage to ask him {{to go out on a}} date.|$|E
25|$|Ecology in {{the narrow}} sense refers to the {{biological}} science of ecology. However, ecological paradigms and principles are being developed and applied in almost all disciplines, and these paradigms {{have to do with}} the way we approach understanding the relationships and inter-connections within and between living beings which give to each its special place and identity. Human ecology, e.g., must certainly take account of the role of our subjective lives and spiritual needs, as well as our biological ones, in terms of their ecological effects. Ecology in this sense is not a reductionist undertaking, but a movement toward a more whole (or holistic) vision and understanding of world processes. Deep ecology seeks to look into all levels of existence and might be viewed as radical by some; for them a more anthropocentric view is appropriated because it put humans at the center. Learning how to live in harmony with our surroundings is beneficial because stopping the global extinction crisis and achieving true ecological sustainability will require rethinking our values as a society. In that way education seems to be the best way to start. Sustainability education aims to help learners understand their interconnectedness with all life, to become creative problem solvers and active citizens, and to engage personally and intellectually in shaping our common future. Experiential learning and critical pedagogy are central to providing opportunities for learners to engage in transformative sustainability learning. The “Environment” broadly defined, remains somewhat neglected within development studies, despite a substantial increase in contributions to the field over the fifteen years since 2000. Undergraduate and postgraduate courses (with some notable exceptions) often “add on” environmental issues as special lectures or modules, and there remains a tendency for those who are grounded in the material and discursive struggles that define the discipline to consider the environment as an exotic special interest, a problem that manifests itself in societies that have the leisure <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> the natural world. Development of a modern education model promoting patriotism and civic responsibility, active social position and healthy lifestyle is closely linked to the development of environmental responsibility in the younger generation. Development of environmentally responsible personality in individual is of particular importance for graduates of educational institutions. Environmental education could be integrated in different curriculum in most fields: education for sustainable development in the context of ecopedagogy.|$|E

500|$|Bloody Disgusting praised Cassidy, {{along with}} her co-stars, for {{bringing}} a spin to the [...] "sorority girl" [...] persona. Similarly, while The Film File stated that despite from the sorority girls [...] "few of them [...] likable or developed enough for the viewer <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> their fates", with Kelli having few personality traits, Cassidy does show a promising spark.|$|E
500|$|Zaireeka {{is viewed}} by the band {{as nothing more than}} an {{experimental}} release. [...] "It was, and still is, intended to be listened to by other artists, musicians and producers," [...] Coyne would later state in the liner notes for The Soft Bulletin 5.1, adding that they [...] "never expected the less involved members of our audience <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
500|$|More recent {{retrospective}} {{reviews of}} the film have been equally mixed, with some critics, like Dennis Schwartz, writing that, [...] "its simple but meaningful story has captured the emotions of its subject in a timeless and real fashion", while others, like David Nusair, find fault: [...] "Presumably, the film's {{supposed to be a}} quirky and revealing slice of life – but since the central character is never developed beyond the superficial, it's impossible <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> her".|$|E
