Duff consumption using LANDFIRE-FCCS loadings did not significantly differ from consumption generated from measured loadings. Because of this, the overall modeled <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> from LANDFIRE-FCCS did not significantly differ from the <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> generated by measured loadings.

We then simulated fire behavior using a full factorial design that included a temporal sequence, with three levels of mortality and three open wind speeds using HIGRAD/FIRETEC, a three-dimensional detailed physics-based model. For each simulation, we assessed fire severity by quantifying dead, live, and <b>total</b> canopy <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption.</b> We then quantified the type and magnitude of the interaction, based on live fuel mortality, by adapting the metric of canopy mass loss that Metz et al. (2013) used to explore the interaction between an introduced pathogen and fire. The metric contrasts live canopy fuel loss due to the two disturbances occurring separately to canopy fuel loss due to a fire (foliage consumption) following bark beetle-caused mortality (foliage mortality). We hypothesized: 1) that fire severity (<b>total</b> canopy <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption)</b> would increase in the red phase and decrease in the gray phase, relative to the green phase, with increasing levels of mortality either increasing (red phase) or decreasing (gray phase) consumption. 2) The bark beetle-fire interaction would be synergistic during the red phase and antagonistic during the gray phase, with {{the magnitude of the}} interaction increasing with the level of mortality and decreasing with increasing wind speeds, since fine-scale effects of mortality levels would be overwhelmed at high wind speeds.|$|R

Some operators choose to lower engine speed, and hence vessel speed, in an attempt to save fuel. However, engine RPM and vessel speed alone are not indicative of <b>total</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption,</b> so arbitrarily lowering engine speed does not guarantee fuel savings. One must do the workflow calculations on how the propulsion system is operating under existing changing conditions and then tie that to fuel consumption.

Some modern fuel management systems are designed to perform these calculations while underway and make recommendations to the vessel master.|$|E

Vehicle and assembly models of PHEVs are established, which provide the foundation for the following calculations.

The real-time optimal control strategy is designed through regarding the minimum of the <b>total</b> equivalent <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> as the control objective and the torque split factor as the control variable. The validation of the control strategy proposed is demonstrated both in the MATLAB/Simulink/Advisor environment and under actual transportation conditions by comparing the fuel economy, the charge sustainability, and parts performance with other three control strategies under different driving cycles including standard, actual, and real-time road conditions. Through numerical simulations and real vehicle tests, the accuracy of the approach used for the evaluation of the equivalent factor is confirmed, and the potential of the proposed control strategy in terms of fuel economy and keeping the deviations of SOC at a low level is illustrated...|$|R
40|$|Transportation {{agencies}} face {{a challenging}} task to repair damaged roads in an aging transportation network with limited funding. In addition, the funding gap is forecasted to continue widening, which has direct {{impacts on the}} performance of surface transportation networks and the nation’s economy in the long run. Recently, transportation agencies were required by a newly enacted law to include national performance-based goals, such as environmental sustainability, in their programming and planning efforts for highway repair and rehabilitation. Therefore, the current practice in the area of highway rehabilitation planning is inadequate to handle this task and new practices are needed to improve the performance of transportation networks while maintain the national goal of maximizing environmental sustainability. Accordingly, this dissertation presents an innovative environmental-based decision-support model for planning highway construction programs. The model is developed in three main parts that are designed to: (1) model <b>total</b> vehicle <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> and public benefits/costs of traveling on transportation networks; (2) evaluate the economic and environmental impacts of highway rehabilitation efforts; and (3) develop a multi-objective optimization model to identify and evaluate highway rehabilitation program(s) that are capable of simultaneously minimizing environmental impact and maximizing public benefits of rehabilitation decisions. ^ First, mathematical models were developed to facilitate estimating the <b>total</b> vehicle <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> and public benefits/cost for road users at the network-level. These models are deigned to estimate vehicle <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> rate, tire depreciation cost, and vehicle repair and maintenance cost rate, in terms of major vehicle–road interaction factors, such as vehicle type, speed, and pavement conditions. The developed and statistically validated models are then used to estimate <b>total</b> vehicle <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> and public benefits/costs at the network-level. ^ Second, a new model was developed for evaluating the impact of decision making in highway rehabilitation efforts on greenhouse gas emissions and public travel costs. The model has the capabilities of: (1) identifying candidate rehabilitation treatment alternatives for damaged or aging pavement; (2) evaluating the impact of these treatments on pavement performance; (3) estimating network <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> due to highway rehabilitation decisions; (4) estimating additional public costs as a result of travel-delay during road construction operations; and (5) evaluating the impact of rehabilitation efforts on public benefits expressed as expected savings in road user costs. ^ Third, a multi-objective optimization model was developed to search for and identify highway rehabilitation programs that are capable of minimizing environmental impact in terms of CO 2 emissions while maximizing public benefits under budget constraints. This newly developed model enables planners and decision makers to design and implement highway rehabilitation programs that are cost-effective and environmentally-conscious. ...|$|R
40|$|Vehicle air {{conditioning}} (A/C) systems significantly increase the fuel use and tailpipe emissions of automobiles. In addition, emissions of the A/C refrigerant are greenhouse gases. In 2002, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) determined the U. S. national and state-by-state fuel use impact of {{air conditioning}} in light duty vehicles. In 2003, we expanded the analysis to cover Europe and Japan. With {{the assistance of}} the automotive climate control community, we have updated the analysis to include demisting, soak temperatures that vary with vehicle type, simplified clothing assumptions, and improved A/C compressor power definition. The updated NREL study shows that the United States uses 7. 0 billion gallons (26. 4 billion liters) of fuel a year for vehicle air conditioning, equivalent to 5. 5 % of the <b>total</b> national <b>fuel</b> use and 9. 5 % of the imported crude oil. If all vehicles had air conditioning, the EU would use 1. 8 billion gallons (6. 9 billion liters) of fuel per year or 3. 2 % of <b>total</b> vehicle <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption.</b> Japan would use 0. 5 billion gallons (1. 7 billion liters) or 3. 4 % of <b>total</b> vehicle <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption.</b> Converting the <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> data into CO 2 emissions determines the indirect impact of air conditioning on the climate. We also determined the magnitude of the potential reduction in fuel use due to incremental improvements in A/C coefficient of performance (COP) over a baseline and the potential fuel saved per vehicle. For example, with a 25 % improvement in A/C COP, a car in Arizona could save 15. 7 gallons per year. These data highlight the potential to reduce operational costs, A/C fuel use, and CO 2 emissions by implementing advanced vehicle climate control technologies. ...|$|R
