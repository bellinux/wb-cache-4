25|$|A more recent, {{and still}} debated, {{development}} in chronic sinusitis {{is the role}} that fungi play in this disease. It remains unclear if fungi are a definite factor {{in the development of}} chronic sinusitis and if they are, what the difference may be between those who develop the disease and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>remain</b> free of symptoms.

25|$|In The Tenant vice is {{not unique}} to the men. Lady Lowborough's {{adultery}} has a particularly devastating effect on her husband, and the malice of Eliza Millward is poisonous to the entire community. The eternal struggle between good and evil is emphasised by heavy use of biblical references: sinners who repent and listen to reason are brought within the fold, while <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>remain</b> stubborn tend to meet violent or miserable ends.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, the {{university}} implemented {{a new policy}} requiring all first-year, full-time undergraduate students to live on campus. The goal of the policy is to provide new students with a comprehensive educational experience.

25|$|The {{reintroduction}} {{of wolves}} in 1995 has significantly decreased the coyote population, although <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>remain</b> often scavenge from wolf kills. Throughout the restoration project, coyote research has continued, {{with an eye}} toward identifying the interactions between coyotes and wolves and on assessing the effects of wolves on coyote populations. During planning and environmental assessment of the effects of wolf restoration, biologists anticipated that coyotes would compete with the larger canid, perhaps resulting in disruption of packs and numerical declines.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in Amarta, Arjuna's {{leadership}} {{is causing the}} populace to feel miserable. Under the influence of Srikandi (who remains possessed by Durga), Arjuna focuses on economic development and increases the number of imports. He establishes monopolies on common commodities hoping to control the population and uses popular culture to promote a sense of selfless nationalism. Much of the disillusioned populace emigrates from Amarta, while others send extensive letters of protest to the palace. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>remain</b> are later possessed by demons under Durga's leadership, becoming prisoners in their own bodies.|$|E
25|$|Prediction of a solar eclipse, i.e., {{exactly when}} and {{where it will be}} visible, {{requires}} a solid lunar theory and proper treatment of the lunar parallax. Hipparchus must have been the first {{to be able to do}} this. A rigorous treatment requires spherical trigonometry, thus <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>remain</b> certain that Hipparchus lacked it must speculate that he may have made do with planar approximations. He may have discussed these things in Perí tēs katá plátos mēniaías tēs selēnēs kinēseōs ("On the monthly motion of the Moon in latitude"), a work mentioned in the Suda.|$|E

25|$|The risk of {{developing}} deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism is different than the total risk {{of the formation of}} blood clots. This is due to the observation that not all blood clots form in the lower legs. Most hospitalized medical patients have at least 1 risk factor for thrombosis that progresses to thromboembolism and this risk persists weeks after discharge. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>remain</b> undiagnosed and not treated prophylacticly have a 26% chance of suffering a fatal embolism. Another 26% develop another embolism. Between 5% and 10% of all in hospital deaths are due to pulmonary embolism (as a consequence of thrombosis). Estimates of the incidence of pulmonary embolism in the US is 0.1% persons/year. Hospital admissions in the US for pulmonary embolism are 200,000 to 300,000 yearly. Thrombosis that develops into DVT will affect 900,000 people and kill up to 100,000 in the US. On average 28,726 hospitalized adults aged 18 and older with a VTE blood clot diagnosis die each year. Risk of thrombosis is related to hospitalization. In 2005 the UK the Parliamentary Health Select Committee determined the annual rate of death due to thrombosis was 25,000 with at least 50% being hospital-acquired.|$|E

The exiles did not plan {{to remain on the}} continent any longer than was necessary; there was considerable controversy and anxiety among them and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>remained</b> in England over the legitimacy of fleeing, rather than facing, religious persecution. This concern contributed to the attention and authority given to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>remained</b> in England and were martyred, as in the writings {{of one of the most}} famous exiles, John Foxe.|$|R
500|$|Hoffman {{finds an}} Al-Saleem safe house in Jordan and orders Ferris to watch it. Simultaneously, Hoffman organizes another 'side operation' via a local agency {{operative}} named Skip (Vince Colosimo) {{and that he}} is to conduct an operation without Ferris' knowledge. Skip employs the use of an agency asset, Ziyad Abishi, who blows cover to a terrorist from the safe house. As he flees to inform his colleagues of their exposure, Ferris makes chase and kills him in such a place and manner that one might believe the death to be random. Salaam (via 'back channels') corroborates the acceptance of killing by <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>remain</b> at the safe house; and Ferris accuses Hoffman of running [...] "side operations" [...] which interfere and (at least) undermine operational integrity of primary operation and tells Hoffman to stop. While going to the hospital to receive rabies shots for bites suffered during the pursuit and elimination of the terrorist, Ferris meets a nurse named Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani), and he begins developing romantic feelings for her. The bombers strike again in an Amsterdam flower market, and kill at least 75 people.|$|E
500|$|Each side of {{the album}} is a {{continuous}} piece of music. [...] The five tracks on each side reflect various stages of human life, beginning and ending with a heartbeat, exploring {{the nature of the}} human experience, and (according to Waters) [...] "empathy". [...] "Speak to Me" [...] and [...] "Breathe" [...] together stress the mundane and futile elements of life that accompany the ever-present threat of madness, and the importance of living one's own life – [...] "Don't be afraid to care". [...] By shifting the scene to an airport, the synthesizer-driven instrumental [...] "On the Run" [...] evokes the stress and anxiety of modern travel, in particular Wright's fear of flying. [...] "Time" [...] examines the manner in which its passage can control one's life and offers a stark warning to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>remain</b> focused on mundane aspects; it is followed by a retreat into solitude and withdrawal in [...] "Breathe (Reprise)". The first {{side of the}} album ends with Wright and vocalist Clare Torry's soulful metaphor for death, [...] "The Great Gig in the Sky". [...] Opening with the sound of cash registers and loose change, the first track on side two, [...] "Money", mocks greed and consumerism using tongue-in-cheek lyrics and cash-related sound effects (ironically, [...] "Money" [...] has been the most commercially successful track from the album, with several cover versions produced by other bands). [...] "Us and Them" [...] addresses the isolation of the depressed with the symbolism of conflict and the use of simple dichotomies to describe personal relationships. [...] "Any Colour You Like" [...] concerns the lack of choice one has in a human society. [...] "Brain Damage" [...] looks at a mental illness resulting from the elevation of fame and success above the needs of the self; in particular, the line [...] "and if the band you're in starts playing different tunes" [...] reflects the mental breakdown of former bandmate Syd Barrett. [...] The album ends with [...] "Eclipse", which espouses the concepts of alterity and unity, while forcing the listener to recognise the common traits shared by humanity.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, apostle Spencer W. Kimball began preaching against racism. In 1972, he said: [...] "Intolerance by church members is despicable. A special problem exists {{with respect to}} black people because they may not now receive the priesthood. Some members of the Church would justify their own un-Christian {{discrimination}} against black people because of that rule {{with respect to the}} priesthood, but while this restriction has been imposed by the Lord, it is not for us to add burdens upon the shoulders of our black brethren. They who have received Christ in faith through authoritative baptism are heirs to the celestial kingdom along with men of all other races. And <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>remain</b> faithful to the end may expect that God may finally grant them all blessings they have merited through their righteousness. Such matters are in the Lord's hands. It is for us to extend our love to all." [...] In a study covering 1972 to 1996, church members in the United States has been shown to have lower rates of approval of segregation than others from the United States, as well as a faster decline in approval of segregation over the periods covered, both with statistical significance.|$|E
