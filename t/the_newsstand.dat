5|$|Growing up, Bueno {{worked as}} a paperboy at <b>the</b> <b>newsstand</b> of his grandmother, Hortensia. In 1984, he {{attended}} concerts of the local band Chébere and was occasionally invited to join them on stage. The next year, {{he dropped out of}} school and started working at his father's record shop, where he sometimes sang for the customers. A friend of his father belonged to the local band Manto Negro and offered Rodrigo a spot in the band. This is where he formally started his career in music, signing his first contract and earning his first salary as a musician at age thirteen. Bueno had written songs since the age of ten, but he would not show them to his colleagues because of his grammar mistakes.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, it was {{announced}} that <b>the</b> <b>newsstand</b> might go out of business, principally because its unique function of supplying yesterday's newspapers was made obsolete by the ability to read them online. The physical structure also required {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} in repairs. In January 2009, a new owner, Muckey's Corporation, won a bidding competition and signed a lease to take over <b>the</b> <b>newsstand.</b> Muckey's diversified the stand's offering with more typical magazines and convenience store fare, but maintained the original name.|$|E
25|$|On March 2, 1950, a {{new type}} of {{stainless}} steel portable newsstand was installed at the Flushing Line platform at Grand Central. <b>The</b> <b>newsstand</b> was owned by the Union News Company.|$|E
50|$|Coughlin visited five of <b>the</b> <b>newsstands</b> <b>the</b> {{wholesaler}} sold to {{and bought}} a copy {{of one of the}} listed magazines. He then filed affidavits for <b>the</b> <b>newsstands</b> and <b>the</b> main office of Kansas City News Distributors with a Jackson County circuit court judge, who issued search warrants that merely repeated the definition of obscenity in the Missouri statutes and did not list any specific titles nor specify in detail the types of materials to be seized. Two days later, Coughlin and other KCPD officers, with some help from the county sheriff's office, executed the warrants.|$|R
50|$|Founded in 1956, {{the first}} issue of 16 hit <b>the</b> <b>newsstands</b> in May 1957, with James Dean on the cover.|$|R
50|$|O'Doherty {{also failed}} to make a success of The Dubliner magazine, {{purchased}} by him in 2008, which ceased publication as an independent magazine in January 2012, eleven {{years to the day}} after the first edition hit <b>the</b> <b>newsstands.</b> <b>The</b> Dubliner's last editor was Martha Connolly.|$|R
25|$|In the mid-2000s {{the station}} was renovated, as were others on the line. The second story was added above the mezzanine. Inside, <b>the</b> <b>newsstand</b> was restored. The station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places after it was renovated.|$|E
25|$|Out of Town News {{was founded}} in 1955 by Sheldon Cohen. Located next to a bustling subway entrance, <b>the</b> <b>newsstand</b> was long noted for {{stocking}} the leading newspapers from around the nation and around the world, {{many of which were}} flown to Boston to be available just one day after printing. Customers, especially academics, came to get the most recent editions of their hometown paper or of newspapers from parts of the world where important news events were unfolding.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{paperback}} houses {{that contributed to}} the decline of the genre–Ace, Dell, Avon, among others–were actually started by pulp magazine publishers. They had the presses, the expertise, and <b>the</b> <b>newsstand</b> distribution networks which made the success of the mass-market paperback possible. These pulp-oriented paperback houses mined the old magazines for reprints. This kept pulp literature, if not pulp magazines, alive. The Return of the Continental Op reprints material first published in Black Mask; Five Sinister Characters contains stories first published in Dime Detective; and The Pocket Book of Science Fiction collects material from Thrilling Wonder Stories, Astounding Science Fiction and Amazing Stories. But note that mass market paperbacks are not pulps.|$|E
50|$|In 1935, the {{moderate}} left-wing Dimineaţa newspaper competed against Universul, a nationalist right-wing newspaper. In order to eliminate his rival, {{the owner of}} Universul, Stelian Popescu, began an anti-semitic campaign (the owners of Dimineaţa were Jews) leading to fascists burning copies of the newspaper and associated posters. The communist and socialist youth organized vigilante groups which defended <b>the</b> <b>newsstands.</b> Brucan was {{part of one of}} the left-wing groups defending <b>the</b> <b>newsstands</b> of Gara de Nord and was involved in a fight with the Iron Guard supporters, sustaining a severe head injury.|$|R

25|$|Engadget Distro was {{a tablet}} {{magazine}} from the editors at Engadget {{that has been}} published {{on a weekly basis}} since its inception, although Special Issues have appeared at times and multiple issues per week are published during the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). The magazine was born from Tim Stevens' desire to provide a different, distilled look at a week's worth of Engadget news, and to enable readers to enjoy that coverage without the frantic nature of the online experience being necessarily attached. The magazine was announced on September 20, 2011 and teased on that night's episode of The Engadget Show in New York City. It became available to the public on October 12, 2011, with the initial issues being available for Apple's iPad.

Each issue is also made available in PDF form.|$|E
500|$|The {{accident}} occurred {{south of}} Valemount, [...] east {{of a small}} station named Canoe River, [...] westbound from Cedarside. The crash {{took place on the}} only stretch (18-mile (29km) long) of CNR mainline in the mountains not protected by automatic block signals. The leading cars of each train were derailed, while those which {{had been part of the}} troop train were demolished. According to testimony at the inquiry, most of the deaths were caused by steam from the troop train's ruptured boiler penetrating the damaged cars. At the moment of the crash, two soldiers, Gunners William Barton and Roger Bowe, both of Newfoundland, were buying cigarettes at <b>the</b> <b>newsstand</b> aboard the train. The structure of <b>the</b> <b>newsstand</b> shielded them in the crash, and they survived. Their fellow Newfoundlanders, Gunners Joseph Thistle and James A. White, standing just a few feet away, were not shielded by <b>the</b> <b>newsstand</b> and perished.|$|E
500|$|The {{magazine}} debuted with a $20.00 newsstand price, a $65.00 yearly {{subscription price}} and $15.00 download price.

500|$|A tribute {{concert was}} {{performed}} on January 16, 2013 during {{the opening of the}} first Cuarteto Carnival, based on the Bahian Carnival. [...] During <b>the</b> <b>Newsstand</b> Day (Día del Canillita) celebrations, Governor of Córdoba José Manuel de la Sota announced his plans to commission a statue of Bueno. It was placed on the Buen Pastor esplanade, and unveiled prior to the Cuarteto Carnival tribute concert. In 2014, another statue was erected to commemorate the fourteenth anniversary of Bueno's death. The bronx-made sculpture was financed by the City of Buenos Aires, and [...] placed in front of the disco Fantastico Bailable, in the Once neighborhood. The ceremony was conducted by Bueno's friend and television host Daniel [...] "Tota" [...] Santillan. The attendance included Deputy Mayor María Eugenia Vidal and Cabinet Chief Horacio Rodríguez Larreta; Bueno's family, business associates and his fans.|$|E
500|$|Wood, Palsgraf's lawyer, {{moved the}} Court of Appeals to allow reargument of the case, alleging that Cardozo had {{confused}} {{the position of}} Palsgraf with that of her daughter Lillian (at <b>the</b> <b>newsstand),</b> and complained about the chief judge's use of such terms as [...] "distant" [...] and [...] "far away". Wood warned that the decision could have far-reaching adverse effects on innocent passengers. The court denied the motion with a one-sentence statement likely written by Cardozo, [...] "If {{we assume that the}} plaintiff was nearer the scene of the explosion than the prevailing opinion would suggest, she was not so near that injury from a falling package, not known to contain explosives, would be within the range of reasonable prevision." [...] Costs of $559.60 were due from Palsgraf to the railroad under Cardozo's order. Posner doubted the sum was ever collected, noting that Palsgraf's family spoke to legal scholars and periodicals about the case in later years, and never mentioned an attempt to collect what would have been about a year's salary for the disabled former janitor.|$|E
500|$|With {{the end of}} World WarII in 1945, Canadian comic-book {{publishing}} faced {{competition from}} American publishers again. [...] Educational and latecomer Feature Publications folded immediately. [...] Maple Leaf tried to compete by switching to colour and by trying {{to break into the}} British market. [...] Anglo-American and another newcomer, Al Rucker Publications, tried to compete directly with the Americans, and even achieved distribution in the US. [...] By the end of 1946 {{it was clear that the}} remaining publishers could not compete, and for the time being original comic-book publishing came to an end in Canada, although some publishers like Bell Features survived by republishing American books until the War Exchange Conservation Act was officially abolished in 1951. The cartoonists who insisted on drawing for a living faced several choices: some moved across the border to attempt to make it with the American publishers, and some moved into illustration work, as Jerry Lazare, Vernon Miller, Jack Tremblay, and Harold Bennett did. [...] Another avenue was the route Sid Barron followed into political cartooning. [...] By 1949, out of 176 comics titles on <b>the</b> <b>newsstand,</b> only 23 were Canadian.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} years, each month the Italian police, in some cities, would order a mass seizure of the magazine. Playmen rarely {{lasted more than}} 48 hours on <b>the</b> <b>newsstands</b> before either being sold or seized.|$|R

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>newsstand</b> {{became famous}} too for its regular {{clientele}} and visitors. John Kenneth Galbraith and Julia Child were both regular customers, and Robert Frost once asked for directions at the {{stand on the}} way to a reading. Paul Allen, then a young programmer at Honeywell, bought the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics at Out of Town News. The magazine inspired Allen and his friend Bill Gates to [...] that April.|$|E

2500|$|In 1915 {{the family}} moved to New York, as many African-American {{families}} did during the Great Migration. Alston's step-father, Henry Bearden, left before his wife and children to secure a job overseeing elevator operations and <b>the</b> <b>newsstand</b> staff at the Bretton Hotel in the Upper West Side. The family lived in Harlem and was considered middle-class. During the Great Depression, the people of Harlem suffered economically. [...] The [...] "stoic strength" [...] seen within the community was later expressed in Charles’ fine art. At Public School 179 in Manhattan, the boy's artistic abilities were recognized and he was asked to draw all of the school posters during his years there.|$|E
2500|$|In 1934 he {{was chosen}} to paint one of the murals {{to be done at}} Coit Tower in San Francisco, with funding from the Public Works of Art Project. He was also {{appointed}} technical director of the Coit Tower murals project. He is prominently represented there by a mural depicting San Francisco city life. This mural includes a self-portrait as well as a portrait of his son, Michael. The mural caused some controversy at the time, because <b>the</b> <b>newsstand</b> Arnautoff portrait is next to excluded the conservative San Francisco Chronicle and included left-wing newspapers. It also included other references to the [...] "lack of concern" [...] people show each other, including a sign for Charlie Chaplin's [...] "City Lights", which is concerned in part with the same theme.|$|E
2500|$|Thereafter {{sales of}} Vanity Fair rose from 200,000 to 1.2 million. In 1988 {{she was named}} Magazine Editor of the Year by Advertising Age magazine.

Despite this success, occasional references later appeared to Vanity Fair losing money. Professor Jeffrey Pfeffer who suggested as much in his book Power: Why Some People Have It – And Others Don't was quickly rebutted by Bernard Leser, president of Conde Nast USA during Brown's tenure. In {{a letter to the}} editor of the Evening Standard, Leser stated Pfeffer's claim was [...] "absolutely false" [...] and affirmed that they had indeed earned [...] "a very healthy profit." [...] Leo Scullin, an independent magazine consultant, called it a [...] "successful launch of a franchise." [...] Under Brown's editorship Vanity Fair won four National Magazine Awards, including a 1989 award for General Excellence.|$|E
