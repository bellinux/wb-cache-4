5|$|About 1400 police {{personnel}} {{were drawn from}} various districts of Andhra Pradesh to provide the first layer of security. In addition to this, over 5000 city policemen were deployed in various places, including the event venues and all the major hotels of the city. Strict anti-sabotage measures were taken <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>security</b> at the athlete hotels. Also, a 24-hour access control system was placed, with sniffer dogs used to sanitise the area.|$|E
5|$|Generally {{when two}} or more rats from the same litter are {{of the same sex}} they live {{together}} with no disruptions but with the occasional friendly tussle and play fight. Although it is possible that rats from different litters can be integrated together, the integration process can be easy or hard. Several measures have to be taken <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>security</b> for both rats.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, the Somali Civil War {{drew the}} world's attention. In August 1992, the United States began to provide {{humanitarian}} assistance, primarily food, through a military airlift. At President Bush's direction, Cheney dispatched {{the first of}} 26,000 U.S. troops to Somalia {{as part of the}} Unified Task Force (UNITAF), designed <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>security</b> and food relief.

5|$|In May 1993, a {{detachment}} from 12 Platoon, D Company, 2/4 RAR was deployed to Cambodia <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>security</b> to the Australian {{contribution to the}} United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia. Operating from Battambang airport in north-west Cambodia {{in support of the}} Army Aviation Group, they conducted static defensive tasks, patrolling and provided a ready reaction force. They joined another detachment of personnel from 5/7 RAR's Support Company, which had been deployed to undertake communications tasks as part of the Force Communications Unit. The deployment came to an end in November 1993. In 1994, the raising of a fifth battalion was approved, with 2/4 RAR de-linked the following year, and 4 RAR returning to the order of battle in its own right.|$|E
5|$|Since reunification, Germany {{has taken}} {{a more active role}} in the European Union. Together with its European {{partners}} Germany signed the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, established the Eurozone in 1999, and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007. Germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the Balkans and sent a force of German troops to Afghanistan as part of a NATO effort <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>security</b> in that country after the ousting of the Taliban. These deployments were controversial since Germany is bound by domestic law only to deploy troops for defence roles.|$|E

5|$|Sophisticated counterfeits {{have been}} found in several Asian {{countries}} such as Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, and are an important cause of avoidable death in those countries. The WHO said that studies indicate that up to 40% of artesunate-based malaria medications are counterfeit, especially in the Greater Mekong region and have established a rapid alert system to enable information about counterfeit drugs to be rapidly reported to the relevant authorities in participating countries. There is no reliable way for doctors or lay people to detect counterfeit drugs without help from a laboratory.

5|$|The {{tree was}} felled on September 23 during a {{ceremony}} attended by between 2,500 and 3,000 people. Among those in attendance were state forester D.B. Griffin, {{the president of}} the Island Creek Coal Company, E.P. Rice, and representatives from other companies that had previously owned and leased the land where the tree was located. In addition to standard cameras photographing the event, two movie cameras were brought to capture the felling and its associated events. Uniformed West Virginia Game, Fish, and Forestry Commission officers, Mingo County sheriffs' deputies, and other law enforcement personnel were also on hand <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>security</b> and direct traffic.|$|E
5|$|This {{incident}} {{sparked a}} major public discussion on station safety and security, mainly because the station was unstaffed when the suspects mugged Ali on the platform. The only security present was CCTV cameras, and the ticket barriers were left open allowing the suspects to enter the station freely. Many high-profile politicians spoke {{on the issue of}} station safety and called on rail companies <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>security</b> or staff the station until the last train had left the station. The Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone assailed Silverlink, the train company who managed the station, for not providing all-night staffing or security. The new provider of every franchise across the rail network will have to provide staff at all times the station is open.|$|E

5|$|To {{assist the}} new government, since February 2000 the United Nations {{has had the}} United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (now called MONUSCO), which {{currently}} has a strength of over 16,000 peacekeepers in the country. Its principal tasks are <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>security</b> in key areas, such as the South Kivu and North Kivu in the east, and to assist the government in reconstruction. Foreign rebel groups {{are also in the}} Congo, as they have been {{for most of the last}} half-century. The most important is the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), against which Laurent Nkunda's troops were fighting, but other smaller groups such as the anti-Ugandan Lord's Resistance Army are also present.|$|E
5|$|When the Italo-Turkish War {{began on}} 29 September 1911, Varese {{assigned}} to the 4th Division of the 2nd Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet, together with her sisters Giuseppe Garibaldi and Francesco Ferruccio. While her sisters bombarded Tripoli on 3–4 October, Varese {{appears to have been}} deployed seaward <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>security</b> for the Italians. On 13 October, the three sisters sailed to Augusta, Sicily to recoal. The ship escorted two troop transports and a hospital ship on her return voyage several days later. On 16 October, she escorted a troop convoy to Homs and bombarded the town after the Ottoman commander refused to surrender. Bad weather prevented any landings until 21 October and the ship continued to provide fire support for the Italian troops.|$|E
5|$|At 9:03a.m., {{the first}} of over 1,8009-1-1 calls related to the bombing was {{received}} by Emergency Medical Services Authority (EMSA). By that time, EMSA ambulances, police, and firefighters had heard the blast and were already headed to the scene. Nearby civilians, who had also witnessed or heard the blast, arrived to assist the victims and emergency workers. Within 23minutes of the bombing, the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) was set up, consisting of representatives from the state departments of public safety, human services, military, health, and education. Assisting the SEOC were agencies including the National Weather Service, the Air Force, the Civil Air Patrol, and the American Red Cross. Immediate assistance also came from 465members of the Oklahoma National Guard, who arrived within the hour <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>security,</b> and {{from members of the}} Department of Civil Emergency Management.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1914 {{the naval}} {{situation}} in the Pacific had eased {{to a large extent}} due to the sinking of the Emden, and it was decided that there was no longer a need to maintain guards on many of the less important facilities, and instead it was decided to concentrate the home defence network upon maintaining the coastal defences and on guarding ships while they were in port. Nevertheless, in the larger seaports these precautions required the commitment of considerable resources, requiring several hundred men <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>security.</b> The requirement for the militia to undertake these duties was eased, however, when a special corps was raised from men that had been rejected for service with the AIF, to which a corps of garrison military police that had served in the AIF was added later.|$|E
5|$|Demonstrating its rapid {{deployability}} {{and ability}} to support V Corps and United States Army Europe contingency operations, every unit within the 18th Military Police Brigade deployed to the Balkans in 1999. The 92nd Military Police Company, followed by the 527th Military Police Company deployed to Sarajevo, Bosnia <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>security</b> in support of SFOR. The 615th Military Police Company deployed to Albania in April in support of Task Force Hawk.

5|$|In 1909, William Howard Taft and Porfirio Díaz {{planned a}} summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, an {{historic}} first meeting between a U.S. {{president and a}} Mexican president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico. But tensions rose {{on both sides of}} the border, including threats of assassination, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>security.</b> Burnham was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by Hammond, who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. Vice-Presidential candidate in 1908. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured and disarmed the assassin within only a few feet of Taft and Díaz.|$|E

5|$|Ron's (Nick Offerman) ex-wife Tammy (Megan Mullally) {{continues}} {{her efforts}} to sabotage his life, but the normally susceptible Ron easily resists her seductions because {{he is now in}} a solid relationship with Tom's (Aziz Ansari) ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson), much to Tom's jealousy. Later, however, Wendy and Ron break up after she announces she is moving back to Canada. Meanwhile, Leslie (Amy Poehler) and the parks department throw a party for the Pawnee police department, where they hope to ask them <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>security</b> for the upcoming Harvest Festival. During the party, Ben (Adam Scott) awkwardly fails to get Chief Trumple's (Eric Pierpoint) favor. Tom, unaware of Ron and Wendy's breakup, arrives at the party with Tammy to make him jealous. After bickering loudly, Ron and Tammy both decide to leave the party together to talk and try to make amends. However, a night filled with drunken sex and mayhem ensues, ending with the two getting remarried and ending up in jail.|$|E
5|$|Events in {{the world}} {{appeared}} to play into the reformers' hands. Poland's neighbors were too occupied with wars to intervene forcibly in Poland, with Russia and Austria engaged in hostilities with the Ottoman Empire (the Russo-Turkish War and the Austro-Turkish War); the Russians also found themselves fighting Sweden (the Russo-Swedish War). At first, King Poniatowski and some reformers hoped to gain Russian support for the reforms; they attempted to draw Poland into the Austro-Russian alliance, seeing a war with the Ottomans {{as an opportunity to}} strengthen the Commonwealth. Due to internal Russian politics, this plan was not implemented. Spurned by Russia, Poland turned to another potential ally, the Triple Alliance, represented on the Polish diplomatic scene primarily by the Kingdom of Prussia. This line of reasoning gained support from Polish politicians such as Ignacy Potocki and Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski. With the new Polish-Prussian alliance seeming <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>security</b> against Russian intervention, King Poniatowski drew closer to leaders of the reform-minded Patriotic Party. This alliance was also helped as the 1790 elections were more supportive of the royal faction then Potocki's; and the conservative faction gained enough new seats to threaten the reformers if they were to stay divided. With the mediation of Scipione Piattoli, Potocki and Poniatowski begun to reach a consensus on a more constitutional monarchy approach, and started to draft a constitutional document.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the tornado {{outbreak}} law enforcement officers, including 30 national guard troops, were sent to Lone Grove <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>security.</b> The American Red Cross opened shelters in Ardmore, Edmond, and Oklahoma City. About 100 volunteers from the Sorghum Mill Estates Neighborhood Association traveled to affected areas in Edmond to help with cleanup efforts. A local restaurant provided free meals to the volunteers as they assisted relief workers. The Salvation Army had two canteens in Oklahoma City, one in Lone Grove, and one in Perkins. About 2,000 meals, drinks, and snacks were provided by the Salvation Army to emergency responders. Feed the Children sent two truckloads of relief supplies to Carter County. They also sent three food trucks, containing a total of 619 meals, 900 drinks, and about 500 snacks, to Ardmore. On February22, the New Life Baptist Church sent drinks and prepackaged snacks, along with items needed for clean-up. Baptist Disaster Relief assisted in Lone Grove with food and emotional care. The Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association (NBA) gave away two tickets to anyone who made a donation of $25 or an equivalent amount of food to benefit victims of the tornado. A concert featuring Chris Cagle and other local musicians at Heritage Hall in Ardmore raised over $18,000 to benefit Carter County tornado victims. Another concert set up by the Salvation Army raised $2,300 more for victims.|$|E
