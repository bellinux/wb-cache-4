40|$|The {{coast of}} the provinces of Granada and Malaga (SE Spain) are {{economically}} important areas for the subtropical fruit cultivation. The climate is characterized by heavy periodic rainfall, {{which is one of}} the main factors responsible for soil erosion in this agroecosystem. However, the erosion depends on a host of factors, including soil, topography, cropping and soilconservation techniques. The most widely taken soil-conservation measure taken on steeply sloped coastal mountains in the zone is terracing. We hypothesise that despite these soil-conservation measures erosion remains a major problem in these steep uplands. Soil loss and runoff were evaluated over a 2 -year period (2001 – 2002) on the <b>taluses</b> of terraces, in this zone of intense subtropical orchard cultivation. The experimental erosion plots (4 m 4 m in area) were located on a terrace of 214 % (658) slope at 180 m in altitude. The results indicated that soil loss occurs from rainfall runoff depositing topsoil at the foot of the terrace. The average annual soil loss by erosion from the <b>taluses</b> of the orchard terraces was 9. 1 Mg ha 1 year 1, with a runoff of 100 mm year 1 and a rain erosivity index (EI 30) of 219. 7 MJ mm ha 1 h 1. Therefore, under these conditions the terraces had a high risk of rockslide and slump, causing environmental and agricultural damages.

5|$|Many nocturnal {{species have}} large, {{independently}} movable ears, {{although there are}} significant differences in sizes and shapes of the ear between species. The structure of the middle and inner ear of strepsirrhines differs between the lemurs and lorisoids. In lemurs, the tympanic cavity, which surrounds the middle ear, is expanded. This leaves the ectotympanic ring, which supports the eardrum, free within the auditory bulla. This trait is also seen in adapiforms. In lorisoids, however, the tympanic cavity is smaller and the ectotympanic ring becomes attached {{to the edge of}} the auditory bulla. The tympanic cavity in lorisoids also has two accessory air spaces, which are not present in lemurs. Both lorisoids and cheirogaleid lemurs have replaced the internal carotid artery with an enlarged ascending pharyngeal artery. Strepsirrhines also possess distinctive features in their tarsus (ankle bones) that differentiate them from haplorhines, such as a sloping talo-fibular facet (the face where the <b>talus</b> bone and fibula meet) and a difference in the location of the position of the flexor fibularis tendon on the <b>talus.</b> These differences give strepsirrhines the ability to make more complex rotations of the ankle and indicate that their feet are habitually inverted, or turned inward, an adaptation for grasping vertical supports.|$|E

40|$|South-eastern Spain, and in {{particular}} the coastal areas of Granada and Malaga, feature a large area under subtropical crops, with orchards established on terraces built along the slopes of the mountainous areas. The climate, characterized by periodically heavy rainfall, variable in space and time, and with the common agricultural practice of leaving the <b>taluses</b> with bare soil, are the main factors encouraging soil erosion, runoff, and subsequent transport of pollutants. Over a two-year period, six plant covers were applied [(Thymus mastichina (Th), Lavandula dentata (La), native spontaneous vegetation (Sv), Anthyllis cytisoides (An), Satureja obovata (Sa), Rosmarinus officinalis (Ro) ] in comparison to a control of bare soil (Bs) to determine the effectiveness of the covers in reducing soil erosion, runoff, and potential pollution risk by agricultural nutrients (N, P, and K) and heavy metals. Also, carbon losses were monitored in the transported sediments by runoff and in eroded soils. For this purpose, 16 m 2 erosion plots (4 m × 4 m) were laid out in the <b>taluses</b> of the terraces. When the yearly data were compared, the control plot (Bs) showed significantly higher soil erosion and runoff rates (26. 4 t ha- 1 yr- 1 and 55. 7 mm yr- 1, respectively) than the treatments with plant covers. The plant covers studied registered the following results in runoff: Ro > Sa > An > Th ˜ La > Sv (41. 7, 38. 2, 35. 5, 16. 9, 16. 1, and 12. 4 mm yr- 1, respectively) while annual soil erosion gave the following results: Sa > An > Ro > Th > Sv > La (18. 0, 13. 5, 13. 4, 5. 5, 4. 4, and 3. 2 Mg ha- 1 yr- 1, respectively). This means that Sv reduced runoff and soil-erosion rates compared to Bs by not less than 78 and 83 %, respectively. Nevertheless, La and Th plots were also very effective plant covers in reducing runoff and soil erosion (71. 2 and 87. 8; 69. 5 and 79. 2 %, respectively) in comparison with the Bs plot. The heaviest nutrient losses in runoff and eroded soils were found in Bs and the lowest in the La, Th, and Sv plots. Bs and Ro plots registered the highest carbon losses (829. 9 and 652. 1 kg ha- 1, respectively), the lowest carbon-loss rates being measured in La, Sv, and Th plots (145. 2, 140. 3, and 109. 3 kg ha- 1, respectively). The results indicate that heavy metals (Mn, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo, Cd, and Pb) in these types of agroecosystems may also be a potential pollutant due to transport by agricultural runoff. There was a major reduction of heavy-metal transport by plant covers in relation to the control of bare soil. The results of this research support the recommendation of using plant covers with multiple purposes (aromatic–medicinal–culinary) on the <b>taluses</b> of subtropical-crop terraces in order to reduce erosion and pollution risk...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to apply an object-based geomorphometric {{procedure}} to define the runoff contribution areas and support a hydro-geomorphological analysis of a 3  km 2 Mediterranean research catchment (southern Italy). Daily and sub-hourly discharge and electrical conductivity data were collected and recorded during a 3 -year monitoring activity. Hydro-chemograph analyses carried out on these data revealed a strong seasonal hydrological response in the catchment that differed from the stormflow events {{that occur in the}} wet periods and in dry periods. This analysis enabled us to define the hydro-chemograph signatures related to increasing flood magnitude, which progressively involves various runoff components (baseflow, subsurface flow and surficial flow) and an increasing contributing area to discharge. Field surveys and water table/discharge measurements carried out during a selected storm event enabled us to identify and map specific runoff source areas with homogeneous geomorphological units previously defined as hydro-geomorphotypes (spring points, diffuse seepage along the main channel, seepage along the riparian corridors, diffuse outflow from hillslope <b>taluses</b> and concentrate sapping from colluvial hollows). Following the procedures previously proposed and used by authors for object-based geomorphological mapping, a hydro-geomorphologically oriented segmentation and classification was performed with the eCognition (Trimble, Inc.) package. The best agreement with the expert-based geomorphological mapping was obtained with weighted plan curvature at different-sized windows. By combining the hydro-chemical analysis and object-based hydro-geomorphotype map, the variability of the contribution areas was graphically modeled for the selected event, which occurred during the wet season, by using the log values of flow accumulation that better fit the contribution areas. The results allow us to identify the runoff component on hydro-chemographs for each time step and calculate a specific discharge contribution from each hydro-geomorphotype. This kind of approach could be useful when applied to similar, rainfall-dominated, forested and no-karst catchments in the Mediterranean eco-region...|$|R

The erosion plots were located on a terrace of 214 % (65 °) slope, at 180 m in altitude and with 16 m 2 (4 × 4 m) in area. Shrubby covers were tested for effectiveness in controlling the nutrient fluxes caused by runoff and sediments. Covers of Thymusserpylloides Bory sbsp.

A greater proportion of NO 3 -, NH- 4 + and K+ were transported in runoff than in sediments. Thyme and sage with respect to the control reduced NO 3 - loss in sediments by 74 and 65 %, NH- 4 + by 71 and 62 %, P by 72 and 67 %, and K by 69 and 61 %, respectively.

This is recorded on its highly varied surface which displays geological units of disparate ages. In particular, seven main regions (in turn subdivided into minor units) can be discriminated {{on the basis of}} the crater density, surface orientation, presence of linear features (i. e. fractures, faults and grooves) and deposits. The regions are separated by clear morphological border and/or cross-cutting and embayment relationships. The oldest ones, pervasively affected by fractures and grooves, display surfaces so heavily cratered to be dated back to a period not far from the Late Heavy Bombardment (one of them yielding a crater retention age of 3. 5 Ga). A crater of 60 km of diameter, probably representing the most prominent event of Lutetia history, cut two of the oldest regions, but it is still quite old as testified by the high crater density on its floor and walls, the absence of discernable deposits related to the impact event, and the intense deformation of its floor. What appears really young is the North Poles crater cluster associated to smooth ejecta broadly mantling the surrounding units and displaying few craters and no linear features. The North Pole cluster is the product of superimposed impacts; the last one of 21 km of diameter excavated the preexisting ejecta up to the bedrock which locally outcrops at the crater rim. During the modification stage the ejecta of this last impact were involved in several gravitational phenomena. The complex evolution of the North Pole region is testified by the great variety of deposits made up of mega-boulders diamictons, fine materials, gravitational <b>taluses</b> and landslide accumulations.

The use of directional seas in design provides a better representation of the ocean surface and a basis for minimizing the over-design of offshore structures. This study examines the means of generation of such types of environments in the wave basin of the Offshore Technology Research Center. Series of tests, {{for a wide variety of}} multi-directional waves, are conducted in order to gather data from wave elevation recorders at different locations in the tank. Drive signals for the pacemaker are computed according to the wave elevation variance table of the sea state to be simulated. Matlab programs, using several spreading functions, are used to prepare the input files. The analysis of the data relies on complex techniques, which will be implemented through the use of either Dr. Borgman's program NUSPEC or the GEDAP analysis software package used at the center. A large part of the results will be presented as contour and three-dimensional graphs, that allows thereafter to compare the different models and also draw some conclusions about the limits of each technique. The final part of the study <b>taluses</b> on freak waves. This interesting type of waves can be modeled by monochromatic waves converging towards the center of the wave basin. Although these waves are quite unusual in the real world, their action on structures at sea can be very destructive. A comparison to the usual type of directional seas is made...|$|R
40|$|We {{provide a}} {{detailed}} morphological {{analysis of the}} Aswan site on comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67 P). We derive the size-frequency distribution of boulders ≥ 2 m and correlate this distribution with the gravitational slopes {{for the first time}} on a comet. We perform the spectral analysis of this region to understand if possible surface variegation is related to the different surface textures observable on the different units. Methods. We used two OSIRIS Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) image data sets acquired on September 19 and 22, 2014, with a scale of 0. 5 m/px. Gravitational slopes derived from the 3 D shape model of 67 P were used to identify and interpret the different units of the site. By means of the high-resolution NAC data sets, boulders ≥ 2. 0 m can be unambiguously identified and extracted using the software ArcGIS. Coregistered and photometrically corrected color cubes were used to perform the spectral analyses, and we retrieved the spectral properties of the Aswan units. Results. The high-resolution morphological map of the Aswan site (0. 68 km) shows that this site is characterized by four different units: fineparticle deposits located on layered terrains, gravitational accumulation deposits, <b>taluses,</b> and the outcropping layered terrain. Multiple lineaments are identified on the Aswan cliff, such as fractures, exposed layered outcrops, niches, and terraces. Close to the terrace margin, several arched features observed in plan view suggest that the margin progressively retreats as a result of erosion. The size-frequency of boulders ≥ 2 m in the entire study area has a power-law index of- 3. 9 + 0. 2 /- 0. 3 (1499 boulders ≥ 2 m/km), suggesting that the Aswan site is mainly dominated by gravitational events triggered by sublimation and/or thermal insolation weathering causing regressive erosion. The boulder size-frequency distribution versus gravitational slopes indicates that when higher gravitational slope terrains are considered, only boulders ≤ 10 m are identified, as well as steeper power-slope indices. In addition, no boulders ≥ 2 m are observed on slopes ≥ 50 °. This may indicate that larger blocks detached from a sublimating cliff cannot rest at these slopes and consequently fall down. The spectral analysis performed on the site shows that despite different morphologic units, no spectral differences appear in the multiple textures. This may confirm a redistribution of particles across the nucleus as a consequence of airfall, whether coming from Hapi or from the southern hemisphere when it is active during perihelion.
