5|$|Market Forces is {{a science}} fiction thriller novel by Richard Morgan. Set in 2049, the story follows Chris Faulkner as he starts his new job as a junior {{executive}} at Shorn Associates, working in their Conflict Investment division where the company supports foreign governments {{in exchange for a}} percentage of the country's gross domestic product. Contracts are awarded, and promotions are given to employees, through driving duels in which combatants race vehicles on empty roads and often kill their opponents. With the Shorn-supported Colombian dictator Echevarria expected to <b>transfer</b> <b>power</b> to his son, who is supported by a competing firm, Chris allies Shorn with a rebel group to overthrow the government, though other executives attempt to sabotage his plans.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of his regency, Pedro promulgated decrees that {{guaranteed}} personal and property rights. He also reduced government expenditure and taxes. Even the revolutionaries arrested in the Merchants' Exchange incident were set free. On 5 June 1821, army troops under Portuguese lieutenant general Jorge Avilez (later Count of Avilez) mutinied, demanding that Pedro should take an oath to uphold the Portuguese Constitution after it was enacted. The prince rode out alone to intervene with the mutineers. He calmly and resourcefully negotiated, winning {{the respect of the}} troops and succeeding in reducing the impact of their more unacceptable demands. The mutiny was a thinly veiled military coup d'état that sought to turn Pedro into a mere figurehead and <b>transfer</b> <b>power</b> to Avilez. The prince accepted the unsatisfactory outcome, but he also warned that {{it was the last time}} he would yield under pressure.|$|E

40|$|Typical {{wireless}} <b>power</b> <b>transfer</b> systems utilize {{series compensation}} circuit {{which is based}} on magnetic coupling and resonance principles that was first developed by Tesla. However, changes in coupling caused by gap distance, alignment and orientation variations can lead to reduce <b>power</b> <b>transfer</b> efficiencies and the <b>transferred</b> <b>power</b> levels. This paper proposes impedance matched circuit to reduce frequency bifurcation effect and improve on the <b>transferred</b> <b>power</b> level, efficiency and total harmonic distortion (THD) performance of the series compensation circuit. A comprehensive mathematical analysis is performed for both series and impedance matched circuits to show the frequency bifurcation effects in terms of input impedance, variations in <b>transferred</b> <b>power</b> levels and efficiencies. Matlab/Simulink results validate the theoretical analysis and shows the circuits’ THD performance when circuits are fed with power electronic converters...|$|R

Fielding and White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan recommended that Reagan <b>transfer</b> <b>power</b> and two letters doing so were drafted: the first letter specifically invoked Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment; the second only mentioned that Reagan was mindful of this provision. At 10:32a.m. on July 13, Reagan signed the second letter and ordered its delivery to the appropriate officers as required under the amendment. Vice President George H. W.

Believing that Wilson and his advisers would not voluntarily <b>transfer</b> <b>power</b> to the vice president, a group of Congressional leaders initiated Marshall's requested joint resolution. The senators opposed to the League of Nations treaty, however, believed that as president Marshall would make several key concessions that would allow the treaty to win ratification. Wilson, in his present condition, was either unwilling or unable to make the concessions, and debate on the bill had resulted in a deadlock. In order to prevent the treaty's ratification, the anti-League senators blocked the joint resolution.|$|E

The Indian Congress refused to oblige with the Britain unless the whole Indian subcontinent was granted the independence.

The Muslim League leaders' British education training and philosophical ideas played a role that brought the British government and the Muslim {{to be close to}} each other. Jinnah himself supported the British in World War II when the Congress failed to form any form of collaboration.

She also said they would be 'a step in the wrong direction' because they were small changes that would risk standing in the way of more sweeping reforms as MPs would essentially be telling themselves and the public 'we've done , we will move on'. Engel drafted a minority report that proposed restarting the committee's work after the 2010 election, when it would have more time to investigate and deliberate.|$|E
25|$|Azad {{occupied}} the time playing bridge and {{acting as the}} referee in tennis matches played by his colleagues. In the early mornings, Azad began working on his classic Urdu work, the Ghubhar-i-Khatir. Sharing daily chores, Azad also taught the Persian and Urdu languages, as well as Indian and world history to several of his companions. The leaders would generally avoid talking of politics, unwilling to cause any arguments that could exacerbate the pain of their imprisonment. However, each year on 26 January, which was then considered Poorna Swaraj (Complete Independence) Day, the leaders would gather to remember their cause and pray together. Azad, Nehru and Patel would briefly speak about {{the nation and the}} future. Azad and Nehru proposed an initiative to forge an agreement with the British in 1943. Arguing that the rebellion had been mistimed, Azad attempted to convince his colleagues that the Congress should agree to negotiate with the British and call for the suspension of disobedience if the British agreed to <b>transfer</b> <b>power.</b> Although his proposal was overwhelmingly rejected, Azad and a few others agreed that Gandhi and the Congress had not done enough. When they learnt of Gandhi holding talks with Jinnah in Mumbai in 1944, Azad criticised Gandhi's move as counter-productive and ill-advised.|$|E

500|$|With the Partition of British India in 1947, Dhaka {{became the}} capital of East Pakistan. The city's {{population}} increased dramatically because of Muslim migration from across Bengal {{and other parts of}} the subcontinent, putting heavy strains on infrastructure. The Awami League was formed at the Rose Garden Palace in 1949 as the Bengali alternative to the domination of the Muslim League in Pakistan. Growing political, cultural and economic rifts emerged between the two wings of the country. The Bengali Language Movement reached its peak in 1952. Dhaka remained a center of revolutionary and political activity, as student activism and demands for autonomy increased. The Six point movement in 1966 was widely supported by the city's residents. The city had an influential press, with prominent newspapers like the [...] Ittefaq and the Weekly Holiday. During the political and constitutional crisis in 1971, the military junta led by Yahya Khan refused to <b>transfer</b> <b>power</b> to the newly elected National Assembly, causing mass riots, civil disobedience and a movement for self-determination. On 7 March 1971, Awami League leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman addressed a massive public gathering at the Ramna Race Course Maidan in Dhaka, in which he warned of an independence struggle. Subsequently, East Pakistan came under a non-co-operation movement against the Pakistani state. On Pakistan's Republic Day (23 March 1971), Bangladeshi flags were hoisted throughout Dhaka in a show of resistance.|$|E
