40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} the strategies of <b>formal</b> customer <b>evaluations</b> and the use of satisfied customer index in the Swedish commercial real estate industry. Design/methodology/approach – This research is based on an inventory of 24 commercial real estate companies use of <b>formal</b> customer <b>evaluations</b> and an analysis of 15 interviews with top-level managers in the Swedish commercial real estate sector. Findings – Only half of the companies included in the study conduct <b>formal</b> <b>evaluations,</b> although they are considered to work customer oriented. Two different strategies for using <b>formal</b> <b>evaluations</b> is, for improvement work and for signalling quality. One proposed explanation to why only half of the companies conduct <b>formal</b> <b>evaluations</b> is the possibility that the official Swedish Real Estate Barometer is not sufficient if the company would like to use the result for organisational development. There are instead indications that this barometer mainly is used in publicity and marketing purpose, to signal quality. Research limitations/implications – The research in this paper is limited to Swedish commercial real estate sector. But, the overall strategies for conducting <b>formal</b> <b>evaluations</b> should be applicable in general. Practical implications – The insight the paper provides regarding how the industry perceive the Swedish Real Estate Barometer gives direct implications of improvements of the barometer. Originality/value – It provides an insight regarding the use of <b>formal</b> customer <b>evaluations</b> and a proposition of how the Swedish Real Estate Barometer could be changed to better support and fulfil the aim of being a barometer for benchmarking...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we attempt to {{understand}} why <b>formal</b> <b>evaluations</b> of IT investment projects have not yet become an organizational routine. Using survey data gathered from business and IT managers in Sweden, we tested the research hypotheses about the factors influencing the attitudes and behaviour of managers towards using <b>formal</b> <b>evaluation</b> methods based on the theory of planned behaviour. We found that the intent to use <b>formal</b> <b>evaluation</b> methods in an organization {{is determined by the}} attitudes of the managers towards the formal methods, the common beliefs of the organization about the formal methods, and the perceived ability to perform <b>formal</b> <b>evaluations.</b> Interestingly, we found that the attitudes toward formal methods are determined mostly by the perceived usefulness of the methods and not by the perceived ease of use of these methods, suggesting that the decision to use formal methods is most likely based on rational analyses rather than individual preferences. We also found that awareness and selfefficacy contribute to the use of formal methods via influences on organizational beliefs and perceived ability to perform evaluation tasks. These findings provide some interesting managerial implications for advocating the use of formal methods in organizations...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the applicability of}} metrics collected during routine use to monitor {{the performance of a}} deployed expert system. METHODS: Two extensive <b>formal</b> <b>evaluations</b> of the GermWatcher (Washington University School of Medicine) expert system were performed approximately six months apart. Deficiencies noted during the first evaluation were corrected via a series of interim changes to the expert system rules, even though the expert system was in routine use. As part of their daily work routine, infection control nurses reviewed expert system output and changed the output results with which they disagreed. The rate of nurse disagreement with expert system output was used as an indirect or surrogate metric of expert system performance between <b>formal</b> <b>evaluations.</b> The results of the second evaluation were used to validate the disagreement rate as an indirect performance measure. Based on continued monitoring of user feedback, expert system changes incorporated after the second <b>formal</b> <b>evaluation</b> have resulted in additional improvements in performance. RESULTS: The rate of nurse disagreement with GermWatcher output decreased consistently after each change to the program. The second <b>formal</b> <b>evaluation</b> confirmed a marked improvement in the program's performance, justifying the use of the nurses' disagreement rate as an indirect performance metric. CONCLUSIONS: Metrics collected during the routine use of the GermWatcher expert system can be used to monitor the performance of the expert system. The impact of improvements to the program can be followed using continuous user feedback without requiring extensive <b>formal</b> <b>evaluations</b> after each modification. When possible, the design of an expert system should incorporate measures of system performance that can be collected and monitored during the routine use of the system...|$|R

40|$|The {{evaluation}} {{of the impact of}} changes in reward systems is a common recommendation in the personnel practitioner literature, but little has been written about how and to what extent practitioners themselves evaluate. This article therefore focuses on the activities of HR managers who have introduced new pay systems, not on academic studies of reward system change. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in 15 large, unionised organisations in England between 2000 and 2002. The study found that little <b>formal</b> <b>evaluation</b> of changes in pay and grading systems had been carried out and that managers expressed considerable scepticism about the evaluation process. They relied heavily on informal or anecdotal feedback, and appeared to have little psychological incentive to evaluate.
