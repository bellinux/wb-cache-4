60|$|The {{salary was}} not large, {{but it would}} pay his expenses, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> wished for at present.|$|E

6000|$|... “Oh! he has, has he?” said Edwards, averting {{his face}} to conceal the color that {{collected}} in his sunburnt cheek. “Well, if <b>that</b> <b>be</b> <b>all,</b> <b>he</b> must even pay the fine.” ...|$|R
5000|$|John, as {{the product}} of both Mrs Whittaker and the Colonel is {{necessarily}} weak and unformed. He is described by Charles Burleigh at one point as being [...] "a young, healthy animal", and in some respects, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>is.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> {{gathered}} before Mrs. Parsons {{was obliged}} to depart to see to her business--except that she was exceedingly glad to see him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wasn't doing anything," [...] {{he would}} explain meekly. [...] "I was only looking." [...] It was {{perfectly}} true; <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> was doing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sthop! ton't choke me!" [...] he gasped, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> {{was allowed}} to utter. Then his arms were fastened, and his feet secured.|$|E
5000|$|Monchito - A strange little {{creature}} <b>that</b> <b>was</b> part of {{the group}} <b>that</b> <b>was</b> abducted into Negation Space. He is called [...] "Monchito" [...] because <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> seems to say. He grows to enormous size in one episode of the comic.|$|R
50|$|In the end, Devaraj is {{reinstated}} {{into the}} police force as trainer and offers to make Ravi a police officer, as he can nominate him as his heir. However, Ravi refuses, stating that he has found the police officer within himself and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> needs to succeed in life.|$|R
6000|$|But if {{you will}} believe me, he merely looked surprised, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all!</b> <b>he</b> didn't grasp the {{situation}} at <b>all,</b> didn't know <b>he</b> had walked into a trap, didn't discover <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> in a trap. I could have shot him, from sheer vexation. With cloudy eye and a struggling intellect he fetched this out: ...|$|R

50|$|Of {{his many}} early experiences, one {{that served as}} a prelude to later tragedies, was seeing the Graf Zeppelin fly over Papa. Inquiring about the symbol painted on the tail of the airship, Andrew's father said <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> a swastika. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> wanted to tell his young son at the time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, we won't raid them, and French Pete 'll <b>be</b> mad, <b>that</b> <b>'s</b> <b>all.</b> <b>He</b> always hates {{being put}} out by the weather.

After the {{announcement}} Damon, Elena and Bonnie leave to search for Stefan while John finds out that the mother's name of the girl who was with Jeremy <b>is</b> Pearl. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> needs to know to understand <b>that</b> she <b>is</b> a vampire from the tomb.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I did see him; but <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all.</b> <b>He</b> {{seemed to}} be in a {{tremendous}} hurry, and said he must be back in town to-night. He's not staying, is he?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He said, with a stress, 'My dear young lady, {{it would}} be better, {{it would be}} more dignified, if you parted, willingly.' <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> said. With a stress on willingly." ...|$|E

6000|$|The knight laughed. [...] "Wages, poor lad, {{what should}} he do with them? He is but a slave, I tell you. Meat, clothes, and fire, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> needs, and I will so deal with him that he will serve you in all {{faithfulness}} and obedience. He can speak English {{enough to know what}} you bid him do, but not enough for chatter with the servants." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He wanted, it seems," [...] the Marquis continued, [...] "to {{have what}} he called a man-to-man talk. I am not the sort of person, as you know, Marcia, who appreciates man-to-man talks with strangers.

6000|$|... 'Clap <b>that</b> on,' <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> said, 'and {{put your}} {{handkerchief}} atop. 'Twill cake {{over in a}} minute. It don't hurt now, do it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have fought}} {{for his father}} and his grandsire," [...] <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> said, [...] "and by Saint Andrew, end the matter as it will, I will not fail him at this pinch." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> said; {{and as for}} thinking, he had {{the posse}} comitatus of seven {{counties}} to think of. But what could those great fortunes and joys be, which Alftruda did not dare to describe? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you should}} not think," [...] said he, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> said, for at that moment Kate Bonnet felt a little jerk {{at the end of}} her line, and then a good strong pull.|$|E
6000|$|... "He has {{not stopped}} very long with us. There is no praise from strangers to be got here," [...] Signora Teresa said tragically. [...] "Avanti! Yes! <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> cares for. To be first somewhere--somehow--to be first with these English. They will be showing him to everybody. 'This is our Nostromo!'"

5000|$|Jehoshua Kaufman, who organises Malmö's [...] "kippah walks" [...] {{expressed}} {{mixed feelings}} for Reepalu, stating that [...] "Reepalu transformed {{the city from}} a port town to a post-industrial place {{with a lot of}} enterprise" [...] but added that [...] "From the outside, he will probably be known as the mayor who was accused of anti-Semitism. It is a little unfair if <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> remembered for, {{but at the same time}} he only has himself to blame." ...|$|R
6000|$|But what, then, {{if he is}} {{not pleased}} with Dumas, or with the effectists who delight genteel people at all the theatres, and in most of the romances, what, I ask, will satisfy this {{extremely}} difficult Spanish gentleman? He would pretend, very little. Give him simple, lifelike character; <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> wants. [...] "For me, the only condition of character <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it <b>be</b> human, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> enough. If I wished to know what was human, I should study humanity." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr Verloc, puffing out his cheeks, let the {{air escape}} violently, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all.</b> <b>He</b> had armed himself with patience. It {{was not to}} be tried much longer. The First Secretary became {{suddenly}} very curt, detached, final.|$|E

6000|$|All of the Royer boys {{noticed that}} Dan Baxter {{did not turn}} up at roll call, nor did the bully put in an {{appearance}} that night. [...] "Got a day off," [...] said Mumps, but <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> could tell.|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> past; <b>he</b> <b>is</b> gone, and Miss Nott {{does not}} even know where he is!" [...] said Renshaw, with a laugh, which, however, {{concealed}} a vague uneasiness.|$|R
5000|$|Bim appears {{and asks}} what {{information}} {{he needs to}} extract from Bom. Bam maintains he only wants to know: [...] "That he said it to him." [...] Bim {{wants to make sure}} <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> needs to obtain and then he can stop. Bam tells him, [...] "Yes." [...] Bam's voice repeats [...] "not good, I start again". Bim then asks what is he to confess. Bam tells him that he needs to confess that he said [...] "it" [...] to him. Bim asks if <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> and Bam says [...] "and what". Bim asks again and Bam says yes. Bim then calls Bom to come with him and they both exit.|$|R
6000|$|He {{took her}} hand, but <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not <b>all</b> <b>he</b> wanted. [...] "Surely Mrs. Podgens {{and her baby}} can wait ten minutes. I shall not see you again for months to come, and yet you seem to begrudge me two words." ...|$|R
