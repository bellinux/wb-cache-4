25|$|In {{both the}} tension and shear joint design cases, some level of tension preload in the bolt and {{resulting}} compression preload in the clamped components {{is essential to the}} joint integrity. The preload target can be achieved by a variety of methods: applying a measured torque to the bolt, measuring bolt extension, heating to expand <b>the</b> bolt then <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> down, torquing <b>the</b> bolt to the yield point, testing ultrasonically, or by applying a certain number of degrees of relative rotation of the threaded components. Each method has a range of uncertainties associated with it, some of which are very substantial.|$|R

50|$|In most {{pendulum}} clocks {{the rate}} is adjusted by moving the bob up or down on the pendulum rod. Moving it up shortens the pendulum, making it beat more quickly, and causing the clock to gain time. In the most common arrangement, the bob {{is attached to the}} pendulum with an adjustment <b>nut</b> at <b>the</b> bottom, on the threaded end of <b>the</b> pendulum rod. <b>Turning</b> <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> adjusts <b>the</b> height of the bob. But some bobs have levers or dials to adjust the height. In some precision clocks there is a smaller auxiliary weight on a threaded shaft to allow more fine adjustment. Tower clocks sometimes have a tray mounted on the pendulum rod, to which small weights can be added or removed, to adjust the rate without stopping the clock.|$|R
50|$|A {{tension control}} bolt (TC bolt) {{is a heavy}} duty bolt used in steel frame construction. The head is usually domed and is not {{designed}} to be driven.

40|$|Macadamia is an {{evergreen}} native rainforest tree {{originating from}} the Australian east coast. The survival of these trees {{in their natural}} habitat was threatened when the land was cleared for agricultural use in the mid- 1800 s. However, commercial cultivation of <b>the</b> macadamia <b>nut</b> through <b>the</b> establishment of plantations in the 1870 s ensured its survival, and today macadamia is Australia’s only indigenous, commercially grown food crop. By the 1890 s, <b>the</b> macadamia <b>nut</b> had been introduced to some regions of the United States, such as Hawaii, where hybridization and cloning developed different varieties, such as Cates, Beaumont’s, and James, <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> into a valuable commercial crop.

50|$|The {{procedure}} {{consists of}} an initial surgery, during which the bone is surgically fractured and the ring apparatus is attached. As the patient recovers, the fractured bone begins to grow together. While the bone is growing, the frame is adjusted by means of <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> <b>nuts,</b> thus increasing <b>the</b> space between two rings. As the rings are connected to {{opposite sides of the}} fracture, this adjustment, done four times a day, moves the now-healing fracture apart by approximately one millimeter per day. The incremental daily increases result in a considerable lengthening of the limb over time. Once the lengthening phase is complete, the apparatus stays on the limb for a consolidation period. The patient is able to fully weight bear on the Ilizarov frame, using crutches initially and pain is lessened. Once healing is complete, a second surgery is necessary to remove the ring apparatus. The result is a limb that is significantly longer. Additional surgery may be necessary, in the case of leg lengthening, to lengthen the Achilles tendon to accommodate the longer bone length. The major advantage of this procedure is that because the apparatus provides complete support while the bone is recovering the patient can remain active aiding recovery.|$|R

50|$|In {{a common}} type of {{stuffing}} box, rings of braided fiber, known as shaft packing or gland packing, form a seal between the shaft and the stuffing box. A traditional variety of shaft packing comprises a square cross-section rope made of flax or hemp impregnated with wax and lubricants. A <b>turn</b> of <b>the</b> adjusting <b>nut</b> compresses <b>the</b> shaft packing. Ideally, the compression is just {{enough to make the}} seal both watertight when the shaft is stationary and drip slightly when <b>the</b> shaft is <b>turning.</b> <b>The</b> drip rate must be at once sufficient to lubricate and cool the shaft and packing, but not so much as could sink an unattended boat.|$|R
50|$|Tie rods may be {{connected}} {{at the ends}} in various ways, but it is desirable that {{the strength of the}} connection should be at least equal to the strength of the rod. The ends may be threaded and passed through drilled holes or shackles and retained by <b>nuts</b> screwed on <b>the</b> ends. If the ends are threaded right- and left-hand the length between points of loading may be altered. This furnishes a second method for pre-tensioning the rod at will by <b>turning</b> it in <b>the</b> <b>nuts</b> so that <b>the</b> length will be changed. A turnbuckle will accomplish the same purpose. The ends may also be swaged to receive a fitting which is connected to the supports. Another way of making end connections is to forge an eye or hook on the rod.|$|R
50|$|The BNC (Bayonet Neill-Concelman) {{connector}} is {{a miniature}} quick connect/disconnect radio frequency connector used for coaxial cable. It features two bayonet lugs on the female connector; mating is fully achieved with a quarter <b>turn</b> of <b>the</b> coupling <b>nut.</b> BNC connectors are used with miniature-to-subminiature coaxial cable in radio, television, and other radio-frequency electronic equipment, test instruments, and video signals. The BNC was commonly used for early computer networks, including ARCnet, the IBM PC Network, and the 10BASE2 variant of Ethernet. BNC connectors {{are made to}} match the characteristic impedance of cable at either 50 ohms or 75 ohms. They are usually applied for frequencies below 4 GHz and voltages below 500 volts.|$|R
40|$|Planetary roller drives (PRD) with axial {{backlash}} {{have the highest}} load capacity amongst the prospective roller drives. PRD consists of a screw and a nut, between which thread rolls are installed in separators, force calculation of which is sufficient to assess the PRD force loading. For several reasons, the load is unevenly distributed between <b>the</b> roll <b>turns</b> operating with <b>the</b> screw and <b>nut</b> <b>turns.</b> These include rollers size variation by the average diameter of their thread, PRD parts' thread manufacturing errors, primarily thread pitch errors, and other reasons. The article discusses one of them – a special feature of thread roll loading. If we neglect the circumferential forces due to their smallness, then <b>the</b> roll's <b>turns</b> mating with <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> along one of the roll's generatrices and <b>the</b> roll <b>turns</b> mating with <b>the</b> screw along the opposite generatrix will be loaded with axial and radial forces. Since the PRD parts thread turn flank angle is symmetrical and equal to 90 °, then the radial force {{is equal to the}} axial one on each turn. If we sum the axial forces on <b>the</b> mating roll <b>turns</b> along one of the generatrices, then from the equation of equilibrium one gets that the sum vector value is equal to the sum vector value along the other roll generatrix. Here the sum vectors will have the opposite direction, and the arm between them equals to the average roll thread diameter. Multiplying the sum vector modulus by that arm, one gets the roll overturning moment that does not depend on the distribution of the axial forces along the roll axis. This moment is the cause of uneven load distribution between <b>the</b> roll <b>turns</b> mating with <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> and <b>the</b> screw. The overturning moment can be balanced on the two forming roll generatrices only by radial forces, distribution of which along the roll axis will be uneven. The PRD parts thread turns load distribution irregularity factor is introduced as the ratio of the maximum force acting on the most loaded roll turn to a nominal force. It is determined in the example that the value of this factor is equal to 1. 454 or 45. 4 %, i. e. the influence of the PRD roll loading characteristics on the drive threaded parts turns loading irregularity is strong...|$|R
50|$|It {{consists}} of a flanged neoprene bushing with a <b>nut</b> embedded in <b>the</b> non-flanged end. The bolt is passed {{through one of the}} pieces to be fastened and threaded onto <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> from <b>the</b> flanged end. The non-flanged end is then inserted through the other piece to be fastened. As the bolt is tightened, friction from the neoprene flange against the piece being fastened prevents <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> from <b>turning.</b> <b>The</b> bushing is compressed by <b>the</b> <b>nut,</b> forming a lip behind the piece being fastened, which compresses the fastened piece and seals the bolt hole.
