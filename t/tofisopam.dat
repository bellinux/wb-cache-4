50|$|<b>Tofisopam</b> is {{also claimed}} to be a PDE10A inhibitor, which may provide an {{alternative}} mechanism of action for its various therapeutic effects, and this action has been proposed to make <b>tofisopam</b> potentially useful as a treatment for schizophrenia.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tofisopam</b> (Emandaxin, Grandaxin, Sériel) is an {{anxiolytic}} that is marketed {{in several}} European countries. Chemically, it is a 2,3-benzodiazepine. Unlike other anxiolytic benzodiazepines (which are generally 1,4- or 1,5-substituted) however, <b>tofisopam</b> {{does not have}} anticonvulsant, sedative, skeletal muscle relaxant, motor skill-impairing or amnestic properties. While {{it may not be}} an anticonvulsant in and of itself, it has been shown to enhance the anticonvulsant action of classical 1,4-benzodiazepines such as diazepam (but not sodium valproate, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin). <b>Tofisopam</b> is indicated for the treatment of anxiety and alcohol withdrawal, and is prescribed in a dosage of 50-300 mg per day divided into three doses. Peak plasma levels are attained two hours after an oral dose. <b>Tofisopam</b> is not reported as causing dependence to the same extent as other benzodiazepines, but is still recommended to be prescribed for a maximum of 12 weeks.|$|E
50|$|Nerisopam (GYKI-52322, EGIS-6775) {{is a drug}} {{which is}} a 2,3-benzodiazepine derivative, related to <b>tofisopam.</b> It has potent {{anxiolytic}} and neuroleptic effects in animal studies.|$|E
50|$|In Russia, {{while the}} drug is {{considered}} a prescription medication (but not a controlled one, as all other benzodiazepines except <b>tofisopam),</b> some pharmacies sell it without prescriptions required.|$|E
5000|$|Girisopam (GYKI-51189, EGIS-5810) {{is a drug}} {{which is}} a 2,3-benzodiazepine derivative, related to <b>tofisopam</b> and zometapine. It has {{selective}} anxiolytic action with no sedative, anticonvulsant or muscle relaxant effects.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tofisopam</b> (Emandaxin and Grandaxin) is a {{drug that}} is a {{benzodiazepine}} derivative. Like other benzodiazepines, it possesses anxiolytic properties, but, unlike other benzodiazepines, {{it does not have}} anticonvulsant, sedative, skeletal muscle relaxant, motor skill-impairing, or amnestic properties.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tofisopam</b> {{has been}} shown to act as an {{inhibitor}} of the liver enzyme CYP3A4, and this could potentially cause dangerous drug interactions with other medications metabolised by this enzyme, although the clinical significance of these findings remains unclear.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tofisopam</b> is not {{approved}} {{for sale in}} the United States or Canada. However, Vela Pharmaceuticals of New Jersey is developing the D-enantiomer (dextofisopam) as a treatment for irritable bowel syndrome, with moderate efficacy demonstrated in clinical trials so far.|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{effects of}} <b>tofisopam</b> were studied on 29 patients with lower urinary tract symptoms. <b>Tofisopam</b> was administered at {{a dose of}} 50 mg {{three times a day}} for more than 2 weeks. The clinical effects of <b>tofisopam</b> were revealed to be 79 % in all patients. Only one patient (3 %) complained of thirst. These results suggest that <b>tofisopam</b> is an effective drug to treat lower urinary tract symptoms...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} two {{repeated}} oral doses of 100 mg <b>tofisopam</b> 15 mg midazolam and placebo on {{the concentrations of}} monoamine metabolites (MHPG, 5 -HIAA, HVA) in lumbar CSF were studied in general surgical patients operated on under spinal analgesia (n = 12 in each group). Midazolam, but not <b>tofisopam,</b> improved the quality of sleep the night before surgery. Both active agents reduced preoperative anxiety of the patients, but <b>tofisopam</b> was without subjective sedative action. In the placebo group, {{in contrast to the}} active drug groups, there was a slight positive correlation between the MHPG concentration and degree of anxiety before surgery. The only significant difference in the monoamine metabolites in lumbar CSF was found in the concentrations of HVA between <b>tofisopam</b> and placebo treated patients. The lower HVA concentrations suggest that the curious 3, 4 -benzodiazepine derivative, <b>tofisopam,</b> modifies central dopaminergic activity...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tofisopam</b> is {{a member}} of the 2, 3 -benzodiazepine {{compound}} family which is marketed for the treatment of anxiety in some European countries. In contrast to classical 1, 4 -benzodiazepines, the compound does not bind to the benzodiazepine binding site of the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor and its psychopharmacological profile differs from such compounds. In addition to anxiolytic properties, antipsychotic effects are reported. We now show that <b>tofisopam,</b> 50  mg/kg intraperitoneally (i. p.), administered in parallel to repeated doses of dizocilpine 0. 2  mg/kg i. p. can ameliorate dizocilpine-induced prolongation of immobility, which is considered to be a model of negative symptoms of psychosis. We further show that <b>tofisopam</b> acts as an isoenzyme-selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) with highest affinity to PDE- 4 A 1 (0. 42  μM) followed by PDE- 10 A 1 (0. 92  μM), PDE- 3 (1. 98  μM) and PDE- 2 A 3 (2. 11  μM). The data indicate that <b>tofisopam</b> is an interesting candidate for the adjuvant treatment of psychosis with focus on negative symptoms. Combined partial inhibition of PDE- 4 and PDE- 10 as well as PDE- 2 may be the underlying mechanism to this activity. Due to the good safety profile of <b>tofisopam</b> as evident from long-term use of this agent in patients, it may be concluded that dual or triple inhibition of PDE isoenzymes with additive or synergistic effects may be an interesting approach to pharmacological activity, resulting in active compounds with beneficial safety profile. Dose-limiting side effects such as emesis induced by selective inhibition of PDE- 4 may be prevented by such strategies...|$|E
40|$|Aim. To study {{efficiency}} {{and safety of}} hydroxizine (H) and <b>tofisopam</b> (T) therapy in DM patients with generalized organic anxiety disorders and subsyndromic anxiety the overall prevalence of which among diabetic patients amounts to 45 - 50 %. Materials and methods. This open prospective randomized comparative study included 60 DM patients with anxiety disorders (AD) of whom 95 % presented with arterial hypertension. The medicines were prescribed at mean therapeutic doses for 3 months followed by 1 month withdrawal period. The efficiency of anxiolytics was estimated from dynamic patterns of reactive anxiety (RA), personal anxiety (PA, Spielberger scale), somatic anxiety symptoms (Giessen questionnaire), HbA 1 c level, systolic and diastolic AP (SAP, DAP), heart rate. Results. Therapy with anxiolytics for 3 months resulted in the decrease of the HbA 1 c level from 7. 9 +- 1. 4 to 7. 4 +- 1. 4 %, total somatic anxiety score from 38. 0 +- 13. 2 to 31. 5 +- 12. 2, PA from 52. 5 +- 9. 7 to 47. 1 +- 8. 8, RA from 32. 3 +- 9. 0 to 25. 5 +- 9. 3, SAP from 141. 4 +- 12. 4 to 129. 8 +- 13. 5 mmHg, DAP from 82. 3 +- 7. 4 to 77. 8 +- 8. 6 mm Hg, HR from 76. 3 +- 9. 5 to 72. 7 - 5. 6 (in all cases p< 0. 05). Subgroups treated with H and T had similar clinical, laboratory, and psychological characteristics before and after therapy. However, H caused a more pronounced fall in PA scores than T whereas T reduced DAP and HR {{to a greater degree}} than H. Termination of therapy was not accompanied by clinical symptoms of withdrawal syndrome. All the above parameters remained stable within 1 month after treatment excepting DAP in the subgroup given T (a rise from 76. 5 +- 5. 6 mm Hg 3 months after the onset of therapy to 81. 0 +- 8. 3 mm Hg 1 month after its withdrawal (p< 0. 05). By the end of the treatment period, 7 patients from the H subgroup and 6 from the T subgroup dropped out of the study including 1 and 0 ones respectively who discontinued presumably due to the drug-related adverse events. Conclusion. 1. Anxiolytic therapy of AD in patients with DM significantly reduces intensity of chronic anxiety; this effect persists within 1 month after the termination of therapy. 2. Simultaneously, manifestations of major risk factors of vascular disorders (glycated hemoglobin, AP) decrease. 3. Mean therapeutic doses of atarax and grandaxin are well tolerated and safe for DM patients who do not develop withdrawal syndrome after the termination of therapy. 4. Despite comparable, on the whole, results of therapy with atarax and grandaxin, the former agent appears to have greater effect on the psychological component and the latter on the somatic (vegetative) component of AD...|$|E
