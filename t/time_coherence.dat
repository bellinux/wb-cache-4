It is considered as a key technology for the fifth generation wireless networks and is already used in wireless LAN (e. g., IEEE 802. 11 ad). Using mmWave for vehicular communications, however, is often viewed with some skepticism due to a misconception that the Doppler spread would become too large at these high frequencies. This is not true when directional beam is employed for communications. In this paper, closed form expressions relating the channel <b>coherence</b> <b>time</b> and beamwidth are derived. Unlike prior work that assumed perfect beam pointing, the pointing error due to the receiver motion is incorporated {{to show that there}} exists a non-zero optimal beamwidth that maximizes the <b>coherence</b> <b>time.</b> To investigate the mobility effect on the beam alignment which is an important feature in mmWave systems, a novel concept of beam <b>coherence</b> <b>time</b> is defined.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the channel capacity {{in the absence of}} prior channel knowledge (noncoherent channel) has gained increasing interest in recent years, but it is still unknown for the general case. In this paper we derive bounds on the capacity of the noncoherent, underspread complex Gaussian, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), wide sense stationary channel with uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS), under a peak power constraint or a constraint on the second and fourth moments of the transmitted signal. These bounds are characterized only by the system signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and by a newly defined quantity termed effective <b>coherence</b> <b>time.</b> Analysis of the effective <b>coherence</b> <b>time</b> reveals that it can be interpreted as the length of a block in the block fading model in which a system with the same SNR will achieve the same capacity as in the analyzed channel. Unlike commonly used <b>coherence</b> <b>time</b> definitions, it is shown that the effective <b>coherence</b> <b>time</b> depends on the SNR, and is a nonincreasing function of it. We show that for low SNR the capacity is proportional to the effective <b>coherence</b> <b>time,</b> while for higher SNR the coherent channel capacity can be achieved provided that the effective <b>coherence</b> <b>time</b> is large enough.
