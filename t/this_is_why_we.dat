But this was standard for the genre, and is probably part of its charm. The versification, too, was mediocre, and Rameau often {{had to have the}} libretto modified and rewrite the music after the premiere because of the ensuing criticism. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> have two versions of Castor et Pollux (1737 and 1754) and three of Dardanus (1739, 1744, and 1760).|$|E

The film held its official premiere the next day at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles—the same venue as Toy Storys—and was released across the United States on November 24, 1999. The film's initial theatrical and video releases include Luxo Jr., Pixar's first short film released in 1986, starring Pixar's titular mascot.

2500|$|Gromyko was {{appointed}} Soviet {{ambassador to the}} United Kingdom at a June 1952 meeting with Joseph Stalin in the Kremlin.

But it is not clear in which direction the British government with their great diplomatic experience will steer their efforts [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> need people who understand their way of thinking". Gromyko met with Winston Churchill in 1952 not to talk about current politics but nostalgically about World War II.

2500|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of scientists are in agreement that the claims of science are necessarily limited to those that develop from natural observations and experiments which can be replicated and substantiated by other scientists, and that claims made by creation science do not meet those criteria. Duane Gish, a prominent creation science proponent, has similarly claimed, [...] "We {{do not know how}} the creator created, what processes He used, for He used processes which are not now operating anywhere in the natural universe. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> refer to creation as special creation. We cannot discover by scientific investigation anything about the creative processes used by the Creator." [...] But he also makes the same claim against science's evolutionary theory, maintaining that on the subject of origins, scientific evolution is a religious theory which cannot be validated by science.|$|E

40|$|The {{widely used}} and {{effective}} passivation approach {{for improving the}} performance of III-V semiconductor devices is the sulfide passivation. According to references and our experiments, InAs passivation using organic sulfide such as thioacetamide and octadecylthiol (ODT: C 18 H 38 S) had better stability against re-oxidation in air than inorganic sulfide such as ammonium sulfide. The ODT passivation shows better results than thioacetamide. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> chose ODT. We also had opportunity to compare ODT treatment with hydrofluoric (HF) treatment. In our experiments, the InAs nanowires (NWs) were first dipped into HF acid before passivation and then the PL measurements were performed afterward. It {{turned out that the}} PL signal showed no obvious change. But the HF acid treatment helped to etch off the surface oxides, as mentioned in the paper. It was thus used to etch the surface oxide before passivation in our experiments. We also tried to use ammonium sulfide solutions to passivate the InAs NW but the PL signal has no obvious changes...|$|R

[...] Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said, [...] "The Supreme Court has delivered {{one of the most significant}} victories for religious freedom in our generation. We are thankful the Supreme Court agreed that the government went too far by mandating that family businesses owners must violate their consciences under threat of crippling fines."

30|$|Firstly, Qinghai {{is located}} in a {{marginal}} area where different cultural spheres meet. Basic anthropological theories tell us that in multi-cultural territories acculturation can take place easily.

The longer they take the better pleased we are: we know that when they are finished the comic lovers will come on.|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> {{determined}} to keep one month sacred to ourselves.

But we are to be married as soon as he is through college because he has a little money of his own--enough to set up housekeeping in a modest way with care and economy. I know Sara will talk about risk and waiting and all that just as she did in Ted Martin's case. But then Sara does not understand.|$|E
60|$|The wonder {{was that}} her health did not fail. People who saw her during that fearful summer, fresh and with color in her cheeks, marvelled. Great-hearted Puss Russell, who came {{frequently}} to inquire, was quieted before her friend, and the frank and jesting tongue was silent in that presence. Anne Brinsmade came with her father and wondered. A miracle had changed Virginia. Her poise, her gentleness, her dignity, were the effects which people saw. Her force people felt. And <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> cannot of ourselves add one cubit to our stature. It is God who changes,--who cleanses us of our levity with the fire of trial. Happy, thrice happy, those whom He chasteneth. And yet how many are there who could not bear the fire--who would cry out at the flame.|$|E

6000|$|The {{first point}} to observe is that, in any {{proposition}} about [...] "the author of Waverley," [...] provided Scott is not explicitly mentioned, the denotation itself, i.e. Scott, does not occur, {{but only the}} concept of denotation, which will be represented by a variable. Suppose we say [...] "the author of Waverley {{was the author of}} Marmion," [...] we are certainly not saying that both were Scott--we may have forgotten that there was such a person as Scott. We are saying that there is some man who was the author of Waverley and the author of Marmion. That is to say, there is some one who wrote Waverley and Marmion, and no one else wrote them. Thus the identity is that of a variable, i.e. of an indefinite subject, [...] "some one." [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> can understand propositions about [...] "the author of Waverley," [...] without knowing who he was. When we say [...] "the author of Waverley was a poet," [...] we mean [...] "one and only one man wrote Waverley, and he was a poet"; when we say [...] "the author of Waverley was Scott" [...] we mean [...] "one and only one man wrote Waverley, and he was Scott." [...] Here the identity is between a variable, i.e. an indeterminate subject ("he"), and Scott; [...] "the author of Waverley" [...] has been analysed away, and no longer appears as a constituent of the proposition.[48] ...|$|E
60|$|There {{were also}} councils held of persons chosen from each tribe, called Amphictyons, for {{arranging}} their affairs, both religious and worldly, and one great Amphictyonic council, which met near Delphi, {{to discuss the}} affairs of all Greece. In truth, all the great nations who long ago parted in Asia have had somewhat the same arrangement. A family grew first into a clan, then into a tribe, then into a nation, and the nation that settled in one country formed fresh family divisions of clans, tribes, and families. At first {{the father of a}} family would take council with the sons, the head of a clan with the fathers of families, the chief of a tribe with the heads of clans, and as these heads of clans grew into little kings, the ablest of them would lead the nation in time of war, as Agamemnon did the chiefs against Troy. However, the Greeks seem for the most part, between the heroic and historical ages, to have dropped the king or chief of each state, and only to have managed them by various councils of the chief heads of families, who were called aristoi, the best, while those who were not usually called into council, though they too were free, and could choose their governors, and vote in great matters, were termed demos, the people. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> hear of aristocracy and democracy. Under these freemen were the people of the country they had conquered, or any slaves they had bought or taken captive, or strangers who had come to live in the place, and these had no rights at all.|$|E
6000|$|How {{they hate}} us, these foreigners, in Belgium {{as much as}} in France! What lies they tell of us; how gladly they would see us humiliated! Honest folks at home over their port-wine say, [...] "Ay, ay, and very good reason they have too. National vanity, sir, wounded--we have beaten them so often." [...] My dear sir, there is not a greater error in the world than this. They hate you because you are stupid, hard to please, and intolerably insolent and air-giving. I walked with an Englishman yesterday, who asked the way to a street of which he {{pronounced}} the name very badly to a little Flemish boy: the Flemish boy did not answer; and there was my Englishman quite in a rage, shrieking in the child's ear as if he must answer. He seemed to think that it was the duty of [...] "the snob," [...] as he called him, to obey the gentleman. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> are hated--for pride. In our free country a tradesman, a lackey, or a waiter will submit to almost any given insult from a gentleman: in these benighted lands one man is as good as another; and pray God it may soon be so with us! Of all European people, which is the nation that has the most haughtiness, the strongest prejudices, the greatest reserve, the greatest dulness? I say an Englishman of the genteel classes. An honest groom jokes and hobs-and-nobs and makes his way with the kitchen-maids, for there is good social nature in the man; his master dare not unbend. Look at him, how he scowls at you on your entering an inn-room; think how you scowl yourself to meet his scowl. To-day, as we were walking and staring about the place, a worthy old gentleman in a carriage, seeing a pair of strangers, took off his hat and bowed very gravely with his old powdered head out of the window: I am sorry to say that our first impulse was to burst out laughing--it seemed so supremely ridiculous that a stranger should notice and welcome another.|$|E
