5|$|The steel-hooped cage crinoline, first {{patented}} in April 1856 by R.C. Milliet in Paris, and {{by their}} agent in Britain a few months later, became extremely popular. Steel cage crinolines were mass-produced in huge quantity, with factories across the Western world producing tens of thousands in a year. Alternative materials, such as whalebone, cane, gutta-percha and even inflatable caoutchouc (natural rubber) were all used for hoops, although steel was the most popular. At its widest point, the crinoline could reach a circumference of up to six yards, although by the late 1860s, crinolines were beginning to reduce in size. By the early 1870s, the smaller crinolette and <b>the</b> <b>bustle</b> had largely replaced the crinoline.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>bustle</b> {{returned}} to fashion and reached its greatest proportions c. 1886–1888, extending almost straight {{out from the}} back waist to support a profusion of drapery, frills, swags, and ribbons. The fashionable corset created a low, full bust with little separation of the breasts.|$|E
25|$|As {{the decade}} progressed, sleeves narrowed, and the {{circular}} hoops of the 1850s decreased in size {{at the front}} and sides and increased at the back. Looped up overskirts revealed matching or contrasting underskirts, a look that would reach its ultimate expression {{the next two decades}} with the rise of <b>the</b> <b>bustle.</b> Waistlines rose briefly {{at the end of the}} decade.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>bustle</b> made a re-appearance in 1883, and it {{featured}} a further exaggerated horizontal protrusion at the back. Due to the additional fullness, drapery moved towards the sides or front {{panel of the}} skirt instead. Any drapery at the back was lifted up into poufs. Bodices on the other hand, shortened and ended above the hips. Yet the style remained tailored, but was more structured.|$|E

25|$|As skirts became fuller {{from the}} 1830s, women wore many {{petticoats}} {{to achieve a}} fashionable bell shape. By the 1850s, stiffened crinolines and later hoop skirts allowed ever wider skirts to be worn. <b>The</b> <b>bustle,</b> a frame or pad worn over the buttocks to enhance their shape, had been used off and on by women for two centuries, but reached the height of its popularity in the later 1880s, and went out of fashion for good in the 1890s.|$|E
25|$|Barry disliked {{being away}} from London not liking life in the country, he {{preferred}} <b>the</b> <b>bustle</b> and society of the city. He was an early riser, usually between four and six o'clock in the morning, he only needed {{four or five hours}} sleep. Preferring to do his thinking and designing in the morning, but was happy to have company while at work, liking to be read to or join in conversation. He had a dislike of public display, considering it hollow and lacking in conviction. His general disposition was sanguine, though he had a quick temper. He preferred science to literature, he frequently attended the Friday night lectures held at the Royal Institution.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston {{exhibited}} …Out of Here: The Veterans Project. The multimedia installation, {{which ran}} from November 4, 2009, to March 28, 2010, filled {{a dark and}} empty museum gallery with recorded voices and explosions, along with flashes of light, simulating {{the experience of a}} mortar attack in Iraq. On three walls of the gallery, projectors cast two horizontal rows of windows, creating the illusion that viewers were inside a darkened warehouse. The eight-minute audio track started with <b>the</b> <b>bustle</b> of traffic and citizens in an Iraqi city, brought in children’s laughter, and subtly overlapped an excerpt from an Al Jazeera broadcast of President Obama speaking about the need to endure in Iraq. Listeners also noted an Islamic call to prayer, forebodingly drowned out by the approach of a helicopter. Without much warning, soldiers began yelling and shooting. When the gunfire ceased, a mother was heard wailing, and the episode ended in ominous silence (voices recorded for Out of Here belonged to a mixture of Iraqi-Americans, United States soldiers, and actors).|$|E

It might be located on a working estate, or in a [...] "resort town" [...] situated on the seacoast, such as Pompeii and Herculaneum.|$|E

Later he met several future writers, including Armijn Pane and Achdiat Karta Mihardja; they soon {{found him to be}} a friendly and diligent student with complete notes and a spotless bedroom (sheets folded so well, Mihardja later recalled, that a [...] "lost fly could have easily slid over them"), but also a romantic prone to thinking wistfully beneath the lamplight and isolating himself from his classmates.|$|E

In 1886, her first year in charge, she added Tristan und Isolde to the canon. Amid <b>the</b> <b>bustle</b> of the festival Cosima refused to be distracted by the illness of her father, Liszt, who collapsed after attending a performance of Tristan and died several days later. Cosima supervised her father's funeral service and burial arrangements, but refused a memorial concert or any overt display of remembrance. According to Liszt's pupil Felix Weingartner, [...] "Liszt's passing was not of sufficient importance to dim the glory of the Festival, even for a moment".|$|E

500|$|Louise's {{father-in-law}} King Frederick William II {{gave the}} couple Charlottenburg Palace, but {{the crown prince}} and his new wife preferred to live at Paretz Palace, just outside Potsdam, where Louise kept herself busy with household affairs. Paretz was far from <b>the</b> <b>bustle</b> of court, as the couple were most content in the [...] "rural retirement" [...] of a country life. The marriage was happy, and Louise was well-beloved by the king, who called her [...] "the princess of princesses" [...] {{and gave her a}} palace in Oranienburg. The crown princess saw it as her duty to support her husband in all his pursuits, and the couple enjoyed singing together and reading from Shakespeare and Goethe. Louise soon became pregnant, disappointingly giving birth to a stillborn girl on 1 October 1794 at the age of eighteen. Nine healthy children would follow in quick succession, though two died in childhood: Crown Prince Frederick William (1795), Prince William (1797), Princess Charlotte (1798), Princess Frederica (1799), Prince Charles (1801), Princess Alexandrine (1803), Prince Ferdinand (1804), Princess Louise (1808), and Prince Albert (1809). The couple also used the Crown Prince's Palace in the capital.|$|E
500|$|The {{crinoline}} {{began to}} fall out of fashion from about 1866. A modified version, the crinolette, was a transitional garment bridging the gap between the cage crinoline and <b>the</b> <b>bustle.</b> Fashionable from 1867 through to the mid-1870s, the crinolette was typically composed of half-hoops, sometimes with internal lacing or ties designed to allow adjustment of fullness and shape. The crinolette was still worn in the early 1880s, with an 1881 article describing it as sticking out solely behind, as opposed to projecting [...] "hideously at the side" [...] like the crinoline. It is possible that some of the smaller crinolines that survive were worn in combination with separate bustles, rather than in isolation. During the 1880s the cage crinoline was revived, with hoop petticoats designed to accommodate the extremely large bustles of the period and support the skirt hems. One of the mid-1880s styles was called the lobster pot due to its resemblance to a lobster trap. Due to the extreme weight of the fabrics of the decade, the hoops of the crinolines were crossed over each other behind the legs in order to support and hold the skirts firmly in place. As with the earlier cage crinolines, sprung steel, wire and cane were used.|$|E
