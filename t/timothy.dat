5|$|In {{the second}} December attack, <b>Timothy</b> Bloodworth was at anchor in Antwerp {{later in the}} month {{awaiting}} a New York-bound convoy. At about 14:10 on 24 December, a German V-2 rocket exploded overhead, showering the ship with shrapnel. A short time later, a second rocket hit nearby and more fragments pelted the ship, this time damaging the starboard {{side of the ship}} at the number one cargo hold. Although <b>Timothy</b> Bloodworth had a total of 68 people aboard—8 officers, 33 crewmen, 26 Armed Guard, and 1 passenger—no one was injured in either attack. Authors Benjamin King and <b>Timothy</b> J. Kutta, in their book Impact: The History of Germany's V-Weapons in World War II, report that <b>Timothy</b> Bloodworth was the first ship to be hit by V-2 fragments during the war.|$|E

The ship departed Gibraltar with convoy KMS 32 on 19 November and arrived at her destination of Malta on 24 November.|$|E
5|$|After her husband's death, Mary Shelley {{lived for}} a year with Leigh Hunt and his family in Genoa, where she often saw Byron and {{transcribed}} his poems. She resolved to live by her pen and for her son, but her financial situation was precarious. On 23 July 1823, she left Genoa for England and stayed with her father and stepmother in the Strand until a small advance from her father-in-law enabled her to lodge nearby. Sir <b>Timothy</b> Shelley had at first agreed to support his grandson, Percy Florence, only if he were handed over to an appointed guardian. Mary Shelley rejected this idea instantly. She managed instead to wring out of Sir <b>Timothy</b> a limited annual allowance (which she had to repay when Percy Florence inherited the estate), but {{to the end of}} his days he refused to meet her in person and dealt with her only through lawyers. Mary Shelley busied herself with editing her husband's poems, among other literary endeavours, but concern for her son restricted her options. Sir <b>Timothy</b> threatened to stop the allowance if any biography of the poet were published. In 1826, Percy Florence became the legal heir of the Shelley estate after the death of his half-brother Charles Shelley, his father's son by Harriet Shelley. Sir <b>Timothy</b> raised Mary's allowance from £100 a year to £250 but remained as difficult as ever. Mary Shelley enjoyed the stimulating society of William Godwin's circle, but poverty prevented her from socialising as she wished. She also felt ostracised by those who, like Sir <b>Timothy,</b> still disapproved of her relationship with Percy Bysshe Shelley.|$|E
