5|$|Prepatellar {{bursitis}} is an {{inflammation of}} the prepatellar bursa {{at the front of}} <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> It is marked by swelling at <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> which can be tender to the touch but which does not restrict the knee's range of motion. It is most commonly caused by trauma to <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> either by a single acute instance or by chronic trauma over time. As such, prepatellar bursitis commonly occurs among individuals whose professions require frequent kneeling.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{symptom of}} prepatellar {{bursitis}} is the {{swelling of the}} area around the kneecap. It generally does not produce a significant amount of pain unless pressure is applied directly to the swelling. The area of swelling may be red (erythema), warm to the touch, or surrounded by cellulitis, particularly if the area has become infected. In such cases, the bursitis is often accompanied by fever. Unlike arthritis, prepatellar bursitis generally does not affect the range of motion of <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> though it may cause some discomfort when <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> is completely flexed. Flexion and extension of <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> may cause crepitus.|$|E

50|$|In this asana, {{the body}} faces {{the floor in}} a fetal position. <b>The</b> <b>knees</b> and hips are bent with the shins on the floor.

The arms may be stretched forward in front of the head or backwards towards the feet.|$|R
5|$|As {{with most}} breeds of dog, the Russian Toy can suffer from patellar luxation, {{which is where}} <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> cap slips out of place when <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> bends as the groove that {{normally}} holds it in place is too shallow. It is usually an inherited defect, which occurs during {{the development of the}} foetus and rarely by trauma.|$|E

5|$|During the 2012–13 NHL lockout, Mitchell began having knee problems, {{requiring}} a first surgery {{to clean up}} debris and a second surgery after re-injuring <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> during rehabilitation prior to the 2012–13 King's training camp.

30|$|Arthrogryposis {{is defined}} as motion {{limitation}} of three or more joints {{in different parts of}} the body, so joints other than <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> are involved in arthrogryposis [1].

5|$|It is {{possible}} to prevent the onset of prepatellar bursitis, or prevent the symptoms from worsening, by avoiding trauma to <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> or frequent kneeling. Protective knee pads can also help prevent prepatellar bursitis for those whose professions require frequent kneeling and for athletes who play contact sports, such as American football, basketball, and wrestling.|$|E

5|$|Next, the {{examining}} physician may check for {{weakness of the}} quadriceps. This examination may reveal fluid in the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The Wilson test is also useful in locating OCD lesions of the femoral condyle. The test is performed by slowly extending <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> from 90 degrees, maintaining internal rotation. Pain at 30 degrees of flexion and relief with tibial external rotation is indicative of OCD.|$|E
5|$|On the ground, the Australian magpie {{moves around}} by walking, {{and is the}} only member of the Artamidae to do so; woodswallows, butcherbirds and currawongs all tend to hop with legs parallel.

5|$|Physical {{examination}} often {{begins with}} {{examination of the}} patient's gait. In OCD of <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> people may walk with the involved leg externally rotated {{in an attempt to}} avoid tibial spine impingement on the lateral aspect of the medial condyle of the femur.|$|E
5000|$|Injuries {{are common}} in ballet dancers because ballet {{consists}} of putting the body in unnatural positions. One such position is first position, in which the heels are placed together as the toes point outward, rotating, or [...] "turning out" [...] the legs. First position puts a risk for injury at <b>the</b> <b>knees.</b> Meniscal tears and dislocations are common at <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> because {{it is easy to}} let <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> slide forward while turned out in first position.|$|R

5|$|Prepatellar {{bursitis}} {{is caused}} by either a single instance of acute trauma to <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> or repeated minor trauma to <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> The trauma can cause extravasation of nearby fluids into the bursa, which stimulates an inflammatory response. This response occurs in two phases: The vascular phase, in which the {{blood flow to the}} surrounding area increases, and the cellular phase, in which leukocytes migrate from the blood to the affected area. Other possible causes include gout, sarcoidosis, CREST syndrome, diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, uremia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Some cases are idiopathic, though these may be caused by trauma that the patient does not remember.|$|E
5|$|The blades are transtibial prostheses, {{meaning they}} replace {{legs and feet}} that are amputated below <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> (BK). They were {{developed}} by medical engineer Van Phillips who incorporated Flex-Foot, Inc., in 1984, and in 2000 sold the company to Össur which now (in 2012) manufactures the blades. They are designed to store kinetic energy like a spring, allowing the wearer to jump and run effectively.|$|E
