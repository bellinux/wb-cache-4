25|$|The test {{described}} here is more fully the null-hypothesis statistical significance test. The null hypothesis represents {{what we would}} believe by default, before seeing any evidence. Statistical significance is a possible finding of the test, declared when the observed sample is unlikely to have occurred by chance if the null hypothesis were true. The name of the test describes its formulation and its possible outcome. One characteristic of the test is its crisp decision: to reject or not reject the null hypothesis. A calculated value is compared to a threshold, which is determined from the <b>tolerable</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>error.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of a binary diagnostic test is usually {{measured in terms}} of its sensitivity and its specificity, or through positive and negative predictive values. Another way to describe the validity of a binary diagnostic test is the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> and the kappa coefficient <b>of</b> the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>error.</b> The <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> is the average loss that is caused when incorrectly classifying a non-diseased or a diseased patient, and the kappa coefficient <b>of</b> the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> {{is a measure of the}} agreement between the diagnostic test and the gold standard. In the presence of partial verification of the disease, the disease status of some patients is unknown, and therefore the evaluation of a diagnostic test cannot be carried out through the traditional method. In this paper, we have deduced the maximum likelihood estimators and variances <b>of</b> the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> and <b>of</b> the kappa coefficient <b>of</b> the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> in the presence of partial verification of the disease. Simulation experiments have been carried out to study the effect of the verification probabilities on the coverage of the confidence interval of the kappa coefficient.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} community pharmacists’ knowledge and certainty of adverse effects and contraindications of pharmaceutical products {{to estimate the}} <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>error.</b> Factors influencing their knowledge and certainty were also investigated. Methods: The knowledge of community pharmacists was assessed in a cross-sectional design using a multiple-choice questions test on the adverse effects and contraindications of active pharmaceutical ingredients and excipients from May 2014 to March 2015. Self-rated certainty scores were also recorded for each question. Knowledge and certainty scores were combined to estimate the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>error.</b> Results: Out <b>of</b> 315 subjects, 129 community pharmacists (41. 0 %) completed the 30 multiple-choice questions test on active ingredients and excipients. Knowledge on active ingredients {{was associated with the}} year of graduation and obtaining a licence to practice pharmacy. Knowledge on excipients was associated with the degree obtained. There was higher <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> in items on excipients than those on ingredients (P< 0. 01). Conclusion: The knowledge of community pharmacists in Palestine was insufficient with high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>errors.</b> Knowledge <b>of</b> community pharmacists on the safety issues of active ingredients and excipients need to be improved...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{investigate}} the mechanisms <b>of</b> diagnostic <b>error</b> {{in primary care}} consultations to detect warning signs for possible error. We aim to identify places in the diagnostic reasoning process associated with major risk indicators. DESIGN: A qualitative study using semistructured interviews with open-ended questions. SETTING: A 2 -month study in primary care conducted in Oxfordshire, UK. PARTICIPANTS: We approached about 25 experienced general practitioners by email or word of mouth, 15 volunteered for the interviews and were available at a convenient time. INTERVENTION: Interview transcripts provided 45 cases <b>of</b> <b>error.</b> Three researchers searched these independently for underlying themes in relation to our conceptual framework. OUTCOME MEASURES: Locating steps in the diagnostic reasoning process associated with major <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> and detecting warning signs that can alert clinicians to increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>error.</b> RESULTS: Initiation and closure of the cognitive process are most exposed to <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>error.</b> Cognitive biases developed early in the process lead to errors at the end. These warning signs {{can be used to}} alert clinicians to the increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> diagnostic <b>error.</b> Ignoring red flags or critical cues was related to processes being biased through the initial frame, but equally well, it could be explained by knowledge gaps. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive biases developed at the initial framing of the problem relate to errors {{at the end of the}} process. We refer to these biases as warning signs that can alert clinicians to the increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> diagnostic <b>error.</b> We conclude that lack of knowledge is likely to be an important factor in diagnostic error. Reducing diagnostic errors in primary care should focus on early and systematic recognition <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> including near misses, and a continuing professional development environment that promotes reflection in action to highlight possible causes of process bias and of knowledge gaps...|$|R

40|$|Background: Nurses {{experience}} insufficient medication knowledge; {{particularly in}} drug dose calculations, {{but also in}} drug management and pharmacology. The weak knowledge could {{be a result of}} deficiencies in the basic nursing education, or lack of continuing maintenance training during working years. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the medication knowledge, certainty and <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> between graduating bachelor students in nursing and experienced registered nurses. Methods: Bachelor students in closing term and registered nurses with at least one year job experience underwent a multiple choice test in pharmacology, drug management and drug dose calculations: 3 x 14 questions with 3 – 4 alternative answers (score 0 – 42). Certainty of each answer was recorded with score 0 – 3, 0 – 1 indicating need for assistance. <b>Risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> was scored 1 – 3, where 3 expressed high risk: being certain that a wrong answer was correct. The results are presented as mean and (SD). Results: Participants were 243 graduating students (including 29 men), aged 28. 2 (7. 6) years, and 203 registered nurses (including 16 men), aged 42. 0 (9. 3) years and with a working experience of 12. 4 years (9. 2). The knowledge among the nurses was found to be superior to that of the students: 68. 9 %(8. 0) and 61. 5 %(7. 8) correct answers, respectively, (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). The difference was largest in drug management and dose calculations. The improvement occurred during the first working year. The nurses expressed higher degree of certainty and the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> was lower, both overall and for each topic (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). Low <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> was associated with high knowledge and high sense of coping (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Conclusions: The medication knowledge among experienced nurses was superior to bachelor students in nursing, but nevertheless insufficient. As much as 25 % of the answers to the drug management questions would lead to high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>error.</b> More emphasis should be put into the basic nursing education and in the introduction to medication procedures in clinical practice to improve the nurses’ medication knowledge and reduce the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>error.</b> © 2014 Simonsen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.
