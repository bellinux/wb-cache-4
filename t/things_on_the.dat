5|$|The premiere {{took place}} at the EPCOR Centre for the Performing Arts in Calgary in February 2011. Performances were {{scheduled}} to run on the centre's Motel stage between February 23 and March 5. Tickets quickly sold out. Four days after the premiere, Burnt Thicket Theatre moved the play to the Scott Block Theatre in Red Deer, where the play was scheduled to be performed until March 12. All the performances in Red Deer were sold out. The play drew emotional reactions from the audience. Kooman learned that some audience members at the initial performances later responded to the play by talking with others about human trafficking, writing letters to their Members of Parliament, and doing other creative <b>things</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject. They also contacted Waldschmidt, sometimes up to a year later, with stories about how the play had continued to affect their lives. In conjunction with the initial run of She Has a Name, Burnt Thicket Theatre provided the names of organizations that assist human-trafficking victims. There was also a panel discussion about human trafficking after the matinée on February 26.|$|E

25|$|Living {{and working}} {{conditions}} in the camps varied significantly across time and place, depending, among other <b>things,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> impact of broader events (World War II, countrywide famines and shortages, waves of terror, sudden influx or release {{of large numbers of}} prisoners). However, to one degree or another, the large majority of prisoners at most times faced meager food rations, inadequate clothing, overcrowding, poorly insulated housing, poor hygiene, and inadequate health care. Most prisoners were compelled to perform harsh physical labor. In most periods and economic branches, the degree of mechanization of work processes was significantly lower than in the civilian industry: tools were often primitive and machinery, if existent, short in supply. Officially established work hours were in most periods longer and days off were fewer than for civilian workers. Often official work time regulations were extended by local camp administrators.|$|E
25|$|If the {{computer}} controlling the display knows the exact position {{and color of}} all the subpixels on the screen, it {{can take advantage of}} this to improve the apparent resolution in certain situations. If each pixel on the display actually contains three rectangular subpixels of red, green, and blue, in that fixed order, then <b>things</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen that are smaller than one full pixel in size can be rendered by lighting only {{one or two of the}} subpixels. For example, if a diagonal line with a width smaller than a full pixel must be rendered, then this can be done by lighting only the subpixels that the line actually touches. If the line passes through the leftmost portion of the pixel, only the red subpixel is lit; if it passes through the rightmost portion of the pixel, only the blue subpixel is lit. This effectively triples the horizontal resolution of the image at normal viewing distances; the drawback is that the line thus drawn will show color fringes (at some points it might look green, at other points it might look red or blue).|$|E
25|$|Lady Cripps {{returned}} to England with her sick grandson. Just before Christmas 1962, Joe {{was released from}} prison and allowed to return to legal practice. The anxieties of the final years of the Nkrumah regime were relieved in 1966, by the coup that ousted Nkrumah. In the years that followed, as her children were abroad at boarding schools and universities, and her husband was active once more in Ghanaian politics and as an ambassador for the nation, she stayed mostly in Kumasi, providing the base from which he could travel out into the world, secure in the knowledge that Peggy was taking care of <b>things</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> home front. She kept an eye on the properties he had inherited from his grand-uncle. Despite her family's extensive political involvements, Peggy herself was not particularly interested in party politics. She supported her husband, of course. But her own contributions were through the wide range of social work she engaged in. Having learned Twi, the language of the Asante, she became interested in and knowledgeable about Akan art and folklore, as she acquired a major goldweight collection, began collecting and translating proverbs, and learned Ananse stories, many of them from her husband. For three decades, a visit to her house and her goldweight collection was {{one of the highlights of}} a visit to Ashanti for visitors interested in its art.|$|E

Nash had signed a two-year contract, yet the South Melbourne committee re-advertised the position of coach {{following the end of}} the 1953 season and while Nash applied, he was not reappointed. Fellow South Melbourne champion Bob Skilton claimed that had Nash been given time, he [...] "would have become one of the all-time great coaches".|$|E

During the initial action, 60 AV-8Bs were deployed on ships such as the [...] and , from which over 1,000 sorties were flown throughout the war. When possible, land-based forward arming and refuelling points were set up to enable prompt operations. USMC commander Lieutenant General Earl B.

[...] The {{references}} in some of the lyrics, including swimming and drawing a line, [...] "are all metaphorical slants on the extent of his emotional devotion". The drawing of a line refers to Martin's habit of writing lists, and underlining those important <b>things</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> list. Martin has commented that the song is about devotion, referring to his unrequited love for someone or something. Despite its lyrical theme, many fans have considered [...] "Yellow" [...] to be an upbeat track, although it is often interpreted as melancholy as well. The song is written in the key of B major with a tempo of 88 beats per minute.|$|E
500|$|The BBC purposefully {{searched for}} an actress with Asperger {{syndrome}} {{to play the}} part of Poppy. Lizzy Clark auditioned for the part after her mother saw an advert on an autism website.

Clark was the first actress with Asperger syndrome to portray a fictional character with the condition. Clark, who has since campaigned with her mother against characters with conditions such as Asperger syndrome being played by actors without the condition, said [...] "My Asperger's made some <b>things</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> film set difficult at first, like dealing with the sudden noise of the storyboard, but I was soon so focused on acting that I didn't notice anything else." ...|$|E

At that time, Takshaka came there in the disguise of a naked mendicant and stole the earrings. Uttanka tried to pursue the mendicant, but Takshaka had reverted to his original form of a serpent and slithered away into a hole in the ground, reaching Naga-loka, the abode of the Nagas. Uttanka then tried to dig through the hole. Indra, the king of the gods, saw Uttanka in the process of digging and sent his weapon Vajra (thunder-bolt) to help him carve a tunnel to the realm of the Nagas. When Uttanka entered the snake world, he started praising the virtues of the snake king Takshaka and his clan, but to no avail as Takshaka was not moved to give up the earrings.|$|E

The reviewer states, [...] "It is a romantic picture, affording ample opportunity for the imagination to run riot {{in a number of different}} directions. ... Much of human nature is disclosed in this film, even though it is, in a way, a travesty upon the way wealthy girls often fall in love with stablemen or others employed about their fathers' places." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror was not very critical, but not offering any praise either. The reviewer highlighted the [...] "common fault of actors" [...] by throwing <b>things</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor and how Ann's refusal to even look at the titled guest was overdone.|$|E
