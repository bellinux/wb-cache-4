5|$|The People's Party {{involved}} {{itself in}} solving the dynastic crisis after Ferdinand's death in July 1927, again approaching Carol to replace the child-king Michael and Prince Nicholas' regency. In November 1927, Averescu <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> {{in the trial of}} his supporter Mihail Manoilescu, who was arrested after having incited pro-Carol sentiment; in his testimony, he backed the notion that, despite his initial anger, Ferdinand had ultimately planned to have Carol return to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Another {{witness who}} had {{attended}} the {{concert at the}} rear of the crowd testified that Blythe's behavior was standard to metal concerts, saying that metal bands always put on angry and tough acts and the concert at issue was no exception. She said that it was evident that Blythe did not want any fans on the stage. Neither the two nor any other witness who <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> that day gave a testimony as to the moment of Nosek's fall at the end of the concert.|$|E
5|$|After {{three weeks}} of jury selection, and eight trial days, the defense made their closing {{statements}} on March 7 in about three hours. They presented three witnesses and then rested their case. Fischer's mother <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> and gave her final testimony, and her version of the story. The judge told prosecutors {{that they had to}} choose to charge the defendants with capital murder or conspiracy to commit murder. The prosecution decided on the capital murder charge, and sought the death penalty for both Cisneros and Garza. The following day, the jury convicted Cisneros and Garza of capital murder for arranging Fischer's death. Neither of them showed any emotion when the verdict was given. Cisneros then removed her jewelry and was taken to the Cameron County jail with Garza. The jurors met the following day to discuss the punishment phase of the trial.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} evening Hare <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> to give evidence. Under {{cross-examination}} about the murder of Docherty, Hare claimed Burke had been the sole murderer and McDougal had twice been involved by bringing Docherty {{back to the house}} after she had run out; Hare stated that he had assisted Burke in the delivery of the body to Knox. Although he was asked about other murders, he was not obliged to answer the questions, as the charge related only to the death of Docherty. After Hare's questioning, his wife entered the witness box, carrying their baby daughter who was suffering from whooping cough. Margaret used the child's coughing fits as a way to give herself thinking time for some of the questions, and told the court that she had a very poor memory and could not remember many of the events.|$|E
5|$|Three judges testified as {{character}} witnesses: John Peter Barnes (N.D. Ill.) {{on behalf of}} Glasser, Kretske, and Roth; Charles Edgar Woodward (N.D. Ill.) on behalf of Glasser and Kretske; and state judge John F. Haas on behalf of Kretske. Kaplan and Horton both <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand,</b> denying that they ever paid money to Glasser or Kretske. Two defense attorneys, Henry Balaban and Edward J. Hess (who was representing Kaplan at the trial), who had also defended clients in cases the government's case-in-chief had alleged to be fixed, denying paying bribes to Glasser or Kretske (although the government had not accused them of this). Glasser's testimony took three hours, as he was cross-examined individually about every single case {{that the government had}} alleged to have been fixed.|$|E
5|$|A former {{employee}} of Chandler's {{testified that he}} bragged about dating three women on the bay that night, and that {{the next morning he}} arrived and delivered materials for a job by boat and immediately set out again. In an attempt to establish Chandler's whereabouts {{on the night of the}} murders, investigators found records of several ship-to-shore telephone calls made from his boat to his home between 1:00am and 5:00am, which may have been attempts to explain his absence to his wife, and to provide himself with an alibi for the time of the murders. Chandler's daughter, Kristal May Sue, testified that her father had talked about killing three women, and that he was afraid of returning to Tampa. A maid, who worked at the motel where the Rogers women stayed, testified that she walked past Chandler on June 1 as she was heading for the Rogers' room for room service. She said that she did not realize the significance of this sighting until Chandler's arrest in 1992; the sighting has never been confirmed. Michelle's boyfriend and Hal Rogers also <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> during trial.|$|E

50|$|The defense strategy, however, was roundly {{criticized by}} the federal {{magistrate}} judge overseeing the hearing, who at one point wanted one of the public defenders to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> to explain why, if he had notarized the fifth affidavit, defense attorneys only acknowledged two of the documents. An attorney representing the public defender said if his client was ordered to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand,</b> he would stand on his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.|$|R
25|$|In the end, Fleva and Filipescu {{were both}} arrested. Fleva stood accused of inciting the riots, and even {{suspected}} of the murder: police alleged that a gun {{had been found}} on his person, but other reports state {{that none of the}} deputies was armed. Carp himself <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> against government actions, denouncing a cover-up attempt.|$|E

25|$|After his arrest, Einhorn {{fled the}} country and spent 23 years in Europe before being extradited to the US. He <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> in his own defense, {{claiming}} his ex-girlfriend {{had been killed by}} CIA agents who framed him for the crime because he knew too much about the agency's paranormal military research. He was convicted and is currently serving a life sentence.|$|E

Both of his grandmothers were ordered {{out of the courtroom}} before he <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand.</b> The prosecution and defense teams both considered the testimony inconsistent and Du Bois complained that the boy had been coached.|$|E
25|$|Thurman was {{the target}} of a stalker from about 2004 to 2011. He was arrested in October 2007 and, {{following}} a trial in which Thurman herself <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand,</b> was convicted of stalking and harassment charges the following May. Sentenced to three years probation, he was arrested again in 2010 on charges of violating a restraining order by attempting to contact her. He pleaded guilty in November 2011 after spending 11 months in jail in lieu of bail, and was released with time served.|$|E
25|$|Regarding Chicoine’s {{allegation}} of Bishop Schuckardt’s incompetency. Neither civil nor ecclesiastical law (Canon 12, Canons 1648 – 50,…) allow legal actions {{to be taken}} against an incompetent person. Since Chicoine’s public accusations of incompetency, Bishop Schuckardt squared off with him in various courts of law in California, Washington, Utah, Canada. Never once did Chicoine raise the incompetency issue in any legal proceeding nor did any court of law ever question the Bishop’s competence, {{despite the fact that the}} Bishop <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> in many of these legal actions.|$|E

25|$|Valentino {{eventually}} befriended Chilean heiress Blanca de Saulles, who was unhappily {{married to}} prominent businessman John de Saulles, {{with whom she}} had a son. Whether Blanca and Valentino actually had a romantic relationship is unknown, but when the de Saulles couple divorced, Valentino <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> to support Blanca de Saulles's claims of infidelity on her husband's part. Following the divorce, John de Saulles reportedly used his political connections to have Valentino arrested, along with a Mrs. Thyme, a known madam, on some unspecified vice charges. The evidence was flimsy at best, and after a few days in jail, Valentino's bail was lowered from $10,000 to $1,500.|$|E
25|$|Williams' {{trial began}} on January 6, 1982 in Fulton County. During the two-month trial, {{prosecutors}} matched nineteen different sources of fibers from Williams' home and car environment—his bedspread, bathroom, gloves, clothes, carpets, dog and an unusual tri-lobal carpet fiber—to {{a number of}} victims. Other evidence included eyewitness testimony placing Williams with several victims while they were alive, and inconsistencies in his accounts of his whereabouts. Williams <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> in his own defense, but alienated the jury by becoming angry and combative. After twelve hours of deliberation, the jury found him guilty on February 27 of the murders of Cater and Payne. He {{was sentenced to life}} imprisonment.|$|E
25|$|On 27 February 2012 Andrea Gilroy, David Gilroy's wife, {{was cited}} as a witness by the Crown. As she <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand,</b> the trial judge Lord Bracadale {{explained}} {{that she had the}} right not to give evidence against her husband if she did not wish. She declined to give evidence. Mrs Gilroy could only decline to give evidence because the events she would speak to took place before section 86 of the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 came into force. This act amended the law such that spouses and civil partners of an accused person in Scotland, are competent and compellable witnesses for the prosecution.|$|E

He also gave a more {{detailed}} version of the pair's plans. Malvo, after extensive psychological counseling, admitted that he was lying at the earlier Virginia trial where he had admitted to being the trigger man for every shooting. Malvo claimed that he had said this {{in order to protect}} Muhammad from a potential death sentence, and because it was more difficult to obtain the death penalty for a minor. Malvo said that he wanted to do what little he could for {{the families of the victims}} by letting the full story be told. In his two days of testimony, Malvo outlined detailed aspects of all the shootings.|$|E
25|$|With {{a change}} in {{administration}} and charges of conflict of interest (on both sides) arising from the original trial, the U.S. Attorney General dropped the lawsuit on 30 November 1897 leaving several issues undecided on the merits. During a deposition filed for the 1887 trial, Meucci claimed to have created the first working model of a telephone in Italy in 1834. In 1886, {{in the first of}} three cases in which he was involved, Meucci <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> as a witness in the hopes of establishing his invention's priority. Meucci's evidence in this case was disputed due to lack of material evidence of his inventions as his working models were reportedly lost at the laboratory of American District Telegraph (ADT) of New York. ADT did not merge with Western Union to become its subsidiary until 1901.|$|E
25|$|On 21 September 2016, Nicky Hager was subpoenaed by Colin Craig's {{lawyers to}} testify {{as part of}} the latter's defence in a {{defamation}} suit filed by Jordan Williams, the co-founder of the New Zealand Taxpayers' Union. Hager had initially volunteered to give evidence, however decided {{he did not want to}} after Mr Williams gave evidence in relation to Craig's treatment of his former press secretary, Rachel MacGregor. Craig gave evidence that he had read Hager's book Dirty Politics before producing his pamphlet Dirty Politics and Hidden Agendas, which was found to have defamed Williams. Hager <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> as an expert witness and alleged that publications linked to Jordan Williams on Cameron Slater's blog attacked Craig and followed a similar pattern that had been documented in his book. After testifying for fifteen minutes, Hager was not cross-examined by Williams' lawyers and was allowed to leave by the judge.|$|E
