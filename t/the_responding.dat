5|$|On 24 December Brilliant and Coventry {{encountered}} {{their second}} privateer, the 24-gun Le Dragon. There {{was a brief}} exchange of fire in which four French sailors were killed and up to 12 wounded, against six wounded men aboard Coventry. After the outgunned French vessel struck her colours the British took her surviving 280 crew prisoner. On the following day a third French ship hove into view, the Intrepid, a 14-gun snow-rigged privateer. After a short chase she fell within range of Brilliants guns; the French fired first, wounding one British sailor. <b>The</b> <b>responding</b> broadside from Brilliant capsized Intrepid and killed ten men among her crew of 120. The survivors were taken prisoner aboard Brilliant and handed over to British authorities at Plymouth.|$|E
5|$|On Saturday, February 7, Murray's father Fred {{arrived in}} Amherst. He told {{investigators}} he and Maura went car-shopping that afternoon and later went {{to dinner with}} a friend of Murray's. Murray dropped her father off at his motel room and, borrowing his Toyota Corolla, she returned to campus to attend a dorm party. She arrived at 10:30 pm. At 2:30 am on Sunday, February 8, she left the party. At 3:30 am, en route to her father's motel, she struck a guardrail on Route 9 in Hadley causing nearly $10,000 worth of damage to her father's car. <b>The</b> <b>responding</b> officer wrote an accident report but there is no documentation of sobriety field tests being conducted. She was driven to her father's motel and stayed in his room the rest of the morning. At 4:49 am, there was a cell phone call placed to Murray's boyfriend from Fred's phone. The participants and content of the phone call are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{exhibition}} {{opened on}} July 9, 1962, with Warhol absent. The thirty-two single soup can canvases {{were placed in}} a single line, much like products on shelves, each displayed on narrow individual ledges. The contemporary impact was uneventful, but the historical impact is considered today {{to have been a}} watershed. The gallery audience was unsure what to make of the exhibit. A John Coplans Artforum article, which was in part spurred on by <b>the</b> <b>responding</b> display of dozens of soup cans by a nearby gallery with a display advertising them at three for 60 cents, encouraged people to take a stand on Warhol. Few actually saw the paintings at the Los Angeles exhibit or at Warhol's studio, but word spread in the form of controversy and scandal due to the work's seeming attempt to replicate the appearance of manufactured objects. Extended debate on the merits and ethics of focusing one's efforts on such a mundane commercial inanimate model kept Warhol's work in art world conversations. The pundits could not believe an artist would reduce the art form to the equivalent of a trip to the local grocery store. Talk did not translate into monetary success for Warhol. Dennis Hopper was the first of only a half dozen to pay $100 for a canvas. Blum decided to try to keep the thirty-two canvases as an intact set and bought back the few sales. This pleased Warhol who had conceived of them as a set, and he agreed to sell the set for ten monthly $100 installments to Blum. Warhol had passed the milestone of his first serious art show. While this exhibition was on view in Los Angeles, Martha Jackson canceled another planned December 1962 New York exhibition.|$|E
50|$|A responsory has two parts: a respond (or refrain), and a verse. Methods of {{performance}} vary, but typically <b>the</b> <b>respond</b> will be begun by the cantor then {{taken up by}} the entire choir. The verse is then sung by a cantor or a small group; or the verse can be begun by the cantor and continued by the entire choir. The chant concludes with a repetition of all or part of <b>the</b> <b>respond.</b> Sometimes <b>the</b> second repetition of <b>the</b> <b>respond</b> is followed by a half-doxology, Gloria Patri et Filio et Spiritui Sancto, sung by the cantor, followed in turn by a third repetition of all or part of <b>the</b> <b>respond.</b>|$|R

25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{whistles}} that possess the characteristics of both monopole and dipole sound sources.

25|$|An {{authoritative}} server indicates {{its status}} of supplying definitive answers, deemed authoritative, by setting a protocol flag, called the Authoritative Answer (AA) bit in its responses.

25|$|The {{fundamental}} difference of these whistles from those described above {{is that there}} are now two sets of characteristic variables. For the driving source, the characteristic speed is U, and the characteristic dimension is L1. For <b>the</b> <b>responding</b> source, the characteristic speed is c0 and the characteristic dimension is L2, typically the corrected cavity depth or tube length. The non dimensional descriptors for each of these are the fluid mechanical Strouhal number and the acoustical Strouhal number. The tie between these two numbers is the commonality of the frequency.|$|E

During these in-situ tests, a constant voltage was applied during the deformation experiment to record current evolution during intermittent plastic flow.

The sparks from the cutting landed inside {{a wall and}} ignited the foam insulation. The area was temporarily evacuated and a minor back injury to one of <b>the</b> <b>responding</b> firefighters was reported. Green Bay Fire Lt. Nick Craig says the fire was small but in an unwieldy area. He says fire officials had to proceed slowly because they didn’t want to open the wall and allow the flames an oxygen supply until they had enough water on hand. The fire happened on Aaron Rodgers Day, a day the state proclaimed {{in honor of the}} Packers quarterback because Rodgers wears No. 12, and the date that Wednesday was 12-12-12. The fire damage cost $5,000 in repairs.|$|E
25|$|The largest battle yet {{since the}} fall of Kunduz to anti-Taliban forces in 2001 took place on April 2, the year's Good Friday, {{in the form of an}} attack by 200 insurgents. A platoon of 2nd Company, 373rd Airborne Battalion was caught in the open after a {{roadside}} bomb struck their patrol in the village of Isa Khel; simultaneously, the troops manning a nearby base situated in an Afghan police station came under fire as well. During nine hours of intense fighting, 20 soldiers out of the 36 strong German platoon trapped in Isa Khel were killed or wounded in action. Six Afghan troops were also killed by German friendly fire. Furthermore, coalition ground troops and responding US MEDEVAC helicopters belonging to the US Army's 158th Aviation Regiment sustained considerable combat damage in a hail of small arms fire. The American helicopters and <b>the</b> <b>responding</b> German forces saved the platoon from almost certain annihilation.|$|E

500|$|In his {{majority}} opinion, Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. {{held that}} Schmerber's constitutional rights were not violated when police took his blood without his consent. Relying upon the Court's holding in Breithaupt v. Abram, {{he concluded that}} the police did not violate Schmerber's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination because the extraction and chemical analysis of the blood sample did not involve [...] "even a shadow of testimonial compulsion." [...] Likewise, Justice Brennan held that the officers did not violate Schmerber's Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable seizures. Justice Brennan wrote that absent exigent circumstances, searches that involve intrusions into the human body require a search warrant. Here, the search was not justified as a search incident to arrest because weapons and contraband are not ordinarily concealed beneath the skin. However, the involuntary blood draw was justified under the Fourth Amendment's exigent circumstances exception because if the officers had waited to receive a search warrant, evidence of intoxication would have been lost through the body's natural metabolism of alcohol in the bloodstream. He wrote that <b>the</b> <b>responding</b> officer [...] "might reasonably have believed that he was confronted with an emergency," [...] where evidence would be destroyed if he waited to receive a warrant. Additionally, Justice Brennan cautioned that the Court's ruling was limited [...] "only to {{the facts of the}} present record" [...] and that [...] "minor intrusions into an individual's body under stringently limited conditions in no way indicates that it permits more substantial intrusions, or intrusions under other conditions." ...|$|E
