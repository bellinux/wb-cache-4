The decades-long history of dissenting opinions in the practice of several European constitutional courts calls for an analysis.  While there is an extensive literature in the United States regarding the use of dissenting opinions, comprehensive empirical research is still absent in Europe.  American scholars have conducted research from several different points of view.

40|$|This {{essay is}} a {{reflection}} on my practice in a service-learning course, in which students got involved in exhibitions of works created by people with disabilities.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the distinctive character of Keiji Nishitani's philosophy of religion, it is necessary to examine what he terms, "the standpoint of experience. " This term was first introduced <b>in</b> the <b>essay,</b> "The Philosophy of Religion: An Introduction" (1941). While absent from his later works, the term nevertheless carries the basic ideas of Nishitani's philosophy of religion. Understanding the meaning of "the standpoint of experience" is, therefore, crucial in shedding light on the fundamental orientation of Nishitani's <b>thought.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, I consider the significance and the status of "the standpoint of experience" in Nishitani's philosophy of religion. The approach will be a comparative study on the following three works: "Religion, History and Culture" (1937), "The Philosophy of Religion: An Introduction" (1941) and "Religion and Nothingness" (1961). The paper begins by underlining the basis of Nishitani's early <b>thought</b> found <b>in</b> the <b>essay,</b> "Religion, History and Culture.

" Finally, it is argued that in his magnum opus, "Religion and Nothingness," "the standpoint of experience" develops into the idea of "appropriation...|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the issue of semblance in art, being only a sketch of the aesthetical problem which would need a {{detailed}} description. I concentrate on a few aspects of the fol-lowing question: “how a philosophy recognize semblance in art?”. Although philosophers as different as Plato, Hegel or Nietzsche had remarked on it, the semblance as an aesthetic appearance did not become the topic of sustained philosophical attention in its own right until past few decades – for example <b>in</b> Adorno‟s <b>thought.</b> <b>In</b> my <b>essay</b> I attempt to theorise the semblance “as an appearance”, that is assuming that the semblance is present without an ontological “superstructure” or a distinctive kind of re-presentation of logos, or truth. In my opinion, traditional thought (including Nietzsche‟s aesthetics) identifies the idea of mimesis and illusion in art. These two concepts correspond to two different kinds of semblance, which create different aesthetical experience. In fact, we think about the semblance through the prism of these ideas and our philosophical depiction of semblance is still deeply rooted in the traditional perspective, yet we experience it at many levels and dimensions.

40|$|What is {{the purpose}} of public education? What is the value of {{taxpayer}} supported public schools? Who is invited to answer these questions? Except among policymakers, few publicly answer or debate these questions. Instead, the neoliberal forces of competition and deregulation seem to be driving education decision-making. The formal education system is seen as a tool for personal and national economic growth. Much of the education policy debate is centered on how to attain academic success as measured by standardized high stakes tests and evaluations. But, how to educate children and youth is a second order question. The first question must be 'what {{is the purpose}} of schooling, and is it limited to the presumed answer that it is to prepare workers so our nations can sustain economic superiority?' Students, parents, teachers, business people, artists, retirees, First Nations people, military veterans, and religious professionals are not typically invited to answer these questions - despite their stake in educational outcomes.

Motivated by {{a growing sense of}} historical uncertainty, Italians increasingly dissented from Croce, but they remained more wedded to Crocean thought—and in particular to Crocean historicism—than has often been argued.
