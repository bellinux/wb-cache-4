40|$|Drawing {{from the}} Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model and {{research}} on social exchange relationships, this study investigates the impact of <b>three</b> <b>job</b> demands (work overload, interpersonal conflict, and dissatisfaction with the organization’s current situation) on employees’ organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), the hitherto unexplored mediating role of organizational commitment in the link between job demands and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), {{as well as how}} this mediating effect might be moderated by social interaction. Using a multi-source, two-wave research design, surveys were administered to 707 employees and their supervisors in a Mexican-based organization. The hypotheses were tested with hierarchical regression analysis. The results indicate a direct negative relationship between interpersonal conflict and OCB, and a mediating effect of organizational commitment for interpersonal conflict and dissatisfaction with the organization’s current situation. Further, social interaction moderates the mediating effect of organizational commitment for each of the <b>three</b> <b>job</b> demands such that the mediating effect is weaker at higher levels of social interaction. The study suggests that organizations aiming to instill OCB among their employees should match the immediate work context surrounding their task execution with an internal environment that promotes informal relationship building...|$|R

40|$|Resource {{management}} for a data center with multiple job classes is investigated in this thesis. We focus on strategies for allocating resources to an application mix {{such that the}} service level agreements (SLAs) of individual applications are met. A performance model with two interactive job classes is {{used to determine the}} smallest number of processor nodes required to meet the SLAs of both classes. For each class, the SLA is specified by the relationship: Prob(response time≤x) ≥y. Two allocation strategies are considered: shared allocation (SA) and dedicated allocation (DA). For the case of FCFS scheduling, analytic results for response time distribution are used to develop a heuristic algorithm that determines the allocation strategy (SA or DA) that requires fewer processor nodes. The effectiveness of this algorithm is evaluated over a range of operating conditions. The performance of SA with non-FCFS scheduling is also investigated. Among the scheduling disciplines considered, a new discipline called probability dependent priority (PDP) is found to have the best performance in terms of requiring the smallest number of nodes. Furthermore, we extend our heuristic algorithm for FCFS to <b>three</b> <b>job</b> classes. The effectiveness of this extended algorithm is evaluated. As to priority scheduling, the performance advantage of PDP is also confirmed for the case of <b>three</b> <b>job</b> classes...|$|R
