40|$|Based on the {{differential}} principle of thread transmission, an analytical model considering helical directions between screw and <b>roller</b> <b>threads</b> in planetary <b>roller</b> screw mechanism (PRSM) {{is presented in}} this work. The model is critical {{for the design of}} PRSM with a smaller lead and a bigger pitch to realize a higher transmission accuracy. The kinematic principle of planetary transmission is employed to analyze the PRSM with different screw <b>thread</b> and <b>roller</b> <b>thread</b> directions. In order to investigate the differences with different screw <b>thread</b> and <b>roller</b> <b>thread</b> directions, the numerical model is developed by using the software Adams to validate the analytical solutions calculated by the presented model. The results indicate, when the helical direction of screw thread is identical with the direction of <b>roller</b> <b>thread,</b> that the lead of PRSM is unaffected regardless of whether sliding between screw and rollers occurs or not. Only when the direction of screw thread is reverse to the direction of <b>roller</b> <b>thread,</b> the design of PRSM with a smaller lead can be realized under a bigger pitch.

The contact line distribution and the contact location were also calculated in order to confirm the cross section of the meshing points. In the research presented in this paper, the actual transmission ratio is analyzed and the study results in a new method to calculate the actual transmission ratio.

The spacer rings have equidistant holes that act as rotary bearings for the smooth pivot ends (studs) of the rollers. Roller-type thrust bearings between the spacer rings and bearing ring permit free rotation of the bearing ring while transferring the axial load between the two.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} requirements imposed to the modern mechanisms is economic feasibility. Therefore, considered as advanced are mechanical transducers of rotary motion to translational one, where rolling friction is mainly realized. They include planetary roller-screw mechanisms (PRSM). PRSM has a large variety of features. The design feature of PRSM is multiple starts of screw and nut <b>thread.</b> <b>Rollers,</b> as a rule, are made single-threaded. Number of screw thread starts which equals to a number of nut thread starts, has an effect on almost all performance characteristics of PRSM. This article covers comprehensively enough the influence of screw thread starts quantity on: kinematical parameters of PRSM, transfer function, mechanism radial dimensions, efficiency, power values, required characteristics of electric motor. As a result of investigations the graphs of dimensionless parameters vs. number of screw thread starts have been plotted, which are demonstrative and common. Being high enough the PRSM efficiency can vary within 20 … 25 % and more. It depends on a variety of mechanism part parameters; primarily on geometrical ones, as well as on a number of screw thread starts. Previously the methods of PRSM design calculation consisted in determination of the main geometric parameters of mechanism parts, then in determination of mechanism efficiency. At that, it was not always possible to design the economically feasible PRSM structure. Introduction of a dimensionless value – a relation of PRSM part thread pitch to average screw thread diameter – contributed to successive plotting of the assemblage of curves for relation of efficiency to the indicated ratio and a number of screw thread starts. By taking this assemblage of curves as a basis, the method of economically feasible PRSM structures calculation and design was proposed.   The essence of the developed method lies in that selection or definition of a number of screw thread starts helps to determine the relation of PRSM parts thread pitch to average diameter of screw thread which provides the maximum possible efficiency. Given further are check calculations confirming the operation capability of the selected PRSM design. </p...|$|R
50|$|The nut {{and screw}} have {{identical}} multiple-start <b>threads.</b> The <b>rollers</b> have a single-start thread with an angle matching the nut thread. The matched thread angle prevents axial movement between the nut and the roller as the rollers spin. The nut assembly includes spacer rings and ring gears that position and guide the rollers. The spacer rings, which rotate within the ring gears, have equidistant holes {{that act as}} rotary bearings for the smooth pivot ends (studs) of the rollers. The ring gears time the spinning and orbit of the rollers about the screw axis by engaging gear teeth near {{the ends of the}} rollers. The spacer rings rotate on axis with the screw in unison with the orbit of the rollers. The spacer rings float relative to the nut, axially secured by retaining rings, because they spin around the screw at a lower frequency (angular velocity) than the nut.|$|R
50|$|The {{screw and nut}} {{may have}} very fine {{identical}} single- or two-start <b>threads.</b> Recirculating <b>rollers</b> are grooved (instead of threaded) so they move axially during spinning engagement with the threads of the nut and screw, shifting up or down by one lead of thread after completing an orbit around the screw. The nut assembly typically includes a slotted cage and cam rings. The cage captivates the rollers in elongated slots, equally spacing the rollers while permitting rotation and axial motion of the rollers. The cam rings have opposing cams aligned with an axial groove in {{the wall of the}} nut. After a roller completes an orbit about the nut it is released into the groove, disengages from nut and screw, and is pushed between the cams to the axial midpoint of the nut assembly (shifting by a distance equal to the lead of the screw). Returned to its starting position, and reengaged to nut and screw, the roller may then orbit the screw once again.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} trends in development of machine engineering is to improve load capacity of mechanisms, assemblies and parts without increasing their overall dimensions and weight. This is also relevant to the most promising items so far, i. e. orbital roller drives (ORD), which are the rotational-to-progressive motion converters widely used in vehicles. The previously published article suggested increasing a load capacity (by about 15 %) through reducing a thread turn section angle of the threaded ORD components and change of the radius of <b>roller</b> <b>thread</b> turn section outline. Due to such ORD modification, a number {{of the most}} critical ORD parameters are to be changed thereby demanding further research. Further, the article published suggests a method considering the abovementioned changes to calculate the dimensions of ORD main components and their tolerance ranges. Though this method being not complete as the increment of ORD center-to-center spacing in relation to its rated value, required for assembly, is unknown; and to determine the ORD center-to-center spacing increment, outer diameters of the <b>roller</b> and screw <b>threads</b> are to be known. Hence, these two methods are interconnected. This article presents the numerical calculation method, mathematical support and method to determine the increment of ORD center-to-center spacing and initial contact point of the mating <b>roller</b> and screw <b>thread</b> turns. Due to considerable scope of calculations, the method was turned into the software. Similar calculation methods and techniques were developed to a particular case, where the thread turn section angle of the threaded components was of 90 °, and the <b>roller</b> <b>thread</b> turn section outline was a circular arc centered to the roller axis. Hence the developed numerical calculation method, mathematical support and technique refer to the general case which is to determine the ORD center-to-center spacing increment and initial contact point of the mating <b>roller</b> and screw <b>thread</b> turns. Taking this into account, the calculations for a particular case were performed as test calculations during the software development. The results obtained matched the calculation results for a particular case published in several papers. Using a developed calculation technique, the calculation method to determine dimensions of ORD main components and their tolerance ranges may be completed for a general case considering the arbitrary turn section angle of threaded ORD components and radius of <b>roller</b> <b>thread</b> turn section outline. </p...|$|R
40|$|It is {{established}} {{that at the}} present moment the roller screws (RS) are the most challenging mechanical transducers of rotational motion into forward motion. For that reason their field of application is being constantly enlarged. In the West one can observe the tendency of the replacement of hydraulic drive by RS-based electromechanical drive. The main RS parts are screw, <b>thread</b> <b>rollers</b> and female screw which on the load transmission interact in the contact lands located on the pitch diameters of the special thread of these parts. To exclude the edge contacts on the male screw and female screw the thread with triangular profile waps are performed, on the rollers – with convex profile. Besides the pitch diameters of the male screw, rollers and female screw thread form the closed-loop dimension chain, and the values of these diameters affect the RS axial play and its performance capabilities significantly. Therefrom in manufacturing thread pieces it is required {{to carry out the}} high-precision control of their thread pitch diameters. For the male thread this control is carried out by means of three cylindrical wires with preferred diameter. Such wires are available at the factories of the Russian Federation and are represented in AllUnion State Standard 2475 - 88 for the standard thread (metric, trapeziform and others), and they are not available for the RS pieces special thread. It was proposed for the RS pieces male thread pitch diameter control to use the standard wires, the diameter of which is the next larger to the necessary preferred diameter of the RS piece controlled thread. The article presents the preferred diameters of the wires for the RS thread pieces control with employed pitch of the special thread. The dependencies for sizing up of the RS pieces male screw and roller pitch diameter dimension control is deduced by utilizing the wires of unspecified diameter, including preferred diameter. In view of the RS potential it is required to set up in Russia the production of wires with preferred diameters for the RS pieces male thread control. In the long term while reexamination of the All-Union state standard 2475 - 88 it is required to enlarge the range of smooth wires with new ones intended for RS advanced concepts pieces male thread pitch diameter control...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} {{trend in the}} development of aerospace industry is to increase load capacity of mechanisms, assemblies, and parts without increasing their size and weight. The above is also true for widely used in aircrafts and the most promising up to date Epicyclic Roller-Screw Mechanisms (ERSM) that convert rotational movement into translational one. Previously (in the article), it was proposed to increase the load capacity (approximately by 15 %) through reduction of included angle of ERSM threaded parts from 90 ° to 70 °. However, such improvement of ERSM will change dimensions of the mechanism parts and its parameters and characteristics (efficiency factor, position of initial point of contact of the conjugated thread turns and parameters of their contact interaction, as well as kinematic parameters), which will require additional studies. If we take into account the priority of these studies, then surely we must begin with development of technique to determine dimensions of the ERSM main parts and their tolerance zones because we need drawings to manufacture and test the upgraded ERSM. We have developed a technique to calculate dimensions of the main parts of ERSM and associated tolerance zones that takes in to account the change of included angle of threaded parts of the mechanism and radius of circular arc according to which <b>roller</b> <b>thread</b> profile has been fulfilled. So the proposed technique is the general one in comparison with the previous ones. This technique uses various conditions and equations to determine dimensions of parts and associated tolerance zones. For example, a nut encircles a screw with rollers, and their dimensions form a closed dimension chain, in which the dimensions and associated tolerances must be such as to ensure ERSM assembling, on the one hand, and, on the other hand the backlash of the mechanism should be minimal to ensure high load capacity, kinematic accuracy, and rigidity of ERSM. We used the following conditions: a lack of sharp thread turns on the screw, <b>rollers</b> and nut; <b>thread</b> turn of <b>roller</b> with minimal thickness is in the root of nut with maximal width; <b>thread</b> turn of <b>roller</b> with minimal thickness is in the root of screw with maximal width, taking into consideration the ERSM design features. Concurrently, possible wear out of threaded surfaces of ERSM parts is taken into account. </p...|$|R
40|$|As a more {{powerful}} transmission device, planetary roller screws (PRSs) recently have received more attention, compared to conventional ball screws.

To facilitate the PRS design, a new study on the parameter relationships of PRS is conducted in this work.

40|$|Today roller-screw {{mechanisms}} (RSM) are {{the most}} prospective motion converters from rotary to linear type. RSM manufacturers have suggested their design in the way, similar to the rolling bearings, in static and dynamic load ratings. The latter means that during long operations the main criterion of the RSM working capacity is fatigue spalling. However, this approach does not permit to consider temporal changes {{of the most critical}} performance parameters of the RSM (such as the axial play, the efficiency factor, the axial stiffness, the accuracy, the starting torque force for zero lash RSMs, etc.) through calculations. The abovementioned method was not perfect, because the choice of the main criterion of RSM working capacity was wrong. The article proves that wear-resistance is the main criterion of RSM working capacity. The proof is the RSM efficiency factor equal to 80 - 88 % on the average. The power loss occurs because of overcoming a sliding friction between multiple (from 300 to 1000) interfacing turns of thread on the screw and the rollers {{as well as on the}} rollers and the nut. That is why the RSMs are the screwtype rolling mechanisms with an essential portion of sliding friction. High-accuracy measurements taken using the device called a form-tracer for threaded pieces permitted to determine the essential changes on the profiles of turns of <b>threads</b> on the <b>rollers</b> (a straight-line portion appeared on the radial profile); these changes could emerge only from wear. Besides, the length of this portion increased with the increasing RSM operation time. The JSC “Moskvich” has examined the RSMs, which have been put out of operation after completing their service life as parts of robot welding machines. There were no traces of fatigue spalling found on the threaded surfaces of the RSM parts, while the sizes of the straight-line portions on the turns of the <b>roller</b> <b>threads</b> were much bigger than they were during the measurements after the initial period of operation. Therefore, it is relevant to conduct a research for developing the RSM wear-resistance calculation methods. The aim and objectives of such a research have been established, and the initial object – a non-nut type roller-screw mechanism of simple design and kinematics – has been chosen. By now a whole range of theoretical studies have been conducted entirely, or partially, a test rig has been designed and manufactured, and the metrological examination methods have been developed for threaded surfaces of the RSM parts...|$|R
50|$|The {{spinning}} frame or water frame {{was developed by}} Richard Arkwright who, along with two partners, patented it in 1769. The design was partly based on a spinning machine built for Thomas High by clockmaker John Kay, who was hired by Arkwright. For each spindle, the water frame used a series of four pairs of rollers, each operating at a successively higher rotating speed, to draw out the fibre, which was then twisted by the spindle. The roller spacing was slightly longer than the fibre length. Too close a spacing caused the fibres to break while too distant a spacing caused uneven <b>thread.</b> The top <b>rollers</b> were leather-covered and loading on the rollers was applied by a weight. The weights kept the twist from backing up before the rollers. The bottom rollers were wood and metal, with fluting along the length. The water frame was able to produce a hard, medium count thread suitable for warp, finally allowing 100% cotton cloth {{to be made in}} Britain. A horse powered the first factory to use the {{spinning frame}}. Arkwright and his partners used water power at a factory in Cromford, Derbyshire in 1771, giving the invention its name.|$|R
50|$|Ellen was {{expected}} to work from 5.30 am till 8.00 pm in the mill. Her job entailed looking after half a frame of throstles, this would probably be 32 ends. As she started, an experienced tenter (spinning operative) would have worked the other half, and been on hand to help her. In time she would have taken over the entire frame, with a consequent wage rise. Later this may have increased to two frames- or more as she trained up another youngster. There are three parts to the job: piecing any broken rovings, rovings can break at any time. The two loose ends are twisted back together {{in a way that}} keeps lumps out of the yarn, it is best done by small young fingers rather than large old arthritic ones. The cops have to be creeled, and the new rovings <b>threaded</b> through the <b>rollers</b> and the flyer and secured to the bobbin. Taller workers find this task easy. Full bobbins have to be doffed and replaced with empty ones. The operative has a degree of control over the timing of these two latter tasks- and throughout the shift would try and balance the timing so roving bobbins did not all run out together, producing a smoother and less stressful work flow. Ellen complained to her mother that she couldn't do this and couldn't 'keep all her ends up'.|$|R
50|$|Toyota {{introduced}} its Valvematic technology in 2008. Valvematic employs an intermediate shaft to achieve continuous variable valve lift. The intermediate shaft has an actuating member for each cylinder. Each actuating member {{is made of}} two finger followers {{on either side of}} a roller bearing member. The followers can rotate in relation to the roller member by means of internal gear threads and an electric motor attached {{to the end of the}} intermediate shaft. The gear <b>threads</b> of the <b>roller</b> member and finger followers are in opposing directions. This means when the shaft swivels, the roller member and finger followers will move in opposing directions, moving either apart or closer together. In this way, the axle angle between them can be varied infinitely by the electric motor. The intake valve is actuated by camshaft via the intermediate shaft. Specifically, the camshaft acts on the roller member of intermediate shaft, transferring the movement to both finger followers, then towards the roller rocker arms and ultimately to the intake valves. When the angle of the finger followers is narrow with respect to the roller member, valve lift is low. As the angle increases, so does valve lift. In this way, Valvematic can vary valve lift by adjusting the angle of the finger followers in relation to the roller bearing member.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} trends in mechanical engineering development is the constant improvement of load capacity of machines, mechanisms, units and parts without increasing their overall dimensions and weight. This is also true for today’s most prospective planetary rollerscrew mechanisms (PRSM) converting motion from rotary to linear type. The problem of PRSM load capacity improvement deserves more attention, because these mechanisms have very high performance characteristics, which leads to problems in the choice of support devices for these mechanisms. However, for many mechanical engineering industries it is important to decrease the PRSMs weight and dimensions, or to improve their reliability and durability. This has led to finding the reserves for improving the PRSM load capacity by decreasing the thread turn profile angle, α, of PRSM threaded parts, as compared to α = 90 ° in traditional mechanisms. When PRSM calculation methods were developed, it was decided to use α = 90 ° for transforming the mechanism parts into a physical model and a design pattern. It allowed us to reduce the PRSM designing to well-known roller bearing designing based on very extensive experimental data. Proposed PRSM designs do not contradict to accepted physical models and design patterns – they just have different basic characteristics of PRSM, i. e. static and dynamic load ratings. Proposed PRSM designs with a thread turn profile angle α= 70 ° on their parts allow to increase the load capacity by 15 %, as compared to traditional PRSMs, which have threaded parts with a thread turn profile angle α = 90 °. There are two factors, which can improve the PRSM load capacity. The first one is the decrease of normal force between mating thread turns of a screw and a roller with the same operational axial force. The second one is the increase of the radius of the shaped profile of a <b>roller</b> <b>thread</b> turn resulting in the expansion of the contact area pattern between the mating thread turns of a screw and a roller. The first factor dominates here. For implementing the proposed PRSM designs into production, one has to explore additionally the effect of α-angle on linkage parameters, process requirements and specific features of the initial contact between the mating thread turns of a screw and a roller. </p...|$|R
