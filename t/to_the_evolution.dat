40|$|Abstract When an (accounting) {{database}} schema {{does not meet}} the requirements of a fmn, the schema must be changed. Such schema evolution can be considered as realizable via a sequence of operators. This research proceeds in the following three steps. First, we define a set of basic evolution schema operators and employ <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> heuristics <b>to</b> guide <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> process. Second, we explore how domain-specific knowledge can be used <b>to</b> guide <b>the</b> use of <b>evolution</b> operators <b>to</b> complete <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> task. A well-known accounting data model is used here <b>to</b> guide <b>the</b> schema <b>evolution</b> process. Third, we discuss a tool built <b>to</b> implement <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> operators, using <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> heuristics and domain-specific knowledge...|$|R

5|$|Tiktaalik has a {{possibility}} of being {{a representative of the}} evolutionary transition from fish to amphibians. It is an example from several lines of ancient sarcopterygian fish developing adaptations to the oxygen-poor shallow-water habitats of its time, environmental conditions which are thought to have led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> of tetrapods.|$|E
5|$|However, some eusocial {{species such}} as {{termites}} are not haplodiploid. Conversely, all bees are haplodiploid but not all are eusocial, and among eusocial species many queens mate with multiple males, creating half-sisters that share only 25% of their genes. Haplodiploidy is thus neither necessary nor sufficient for eusociality. But, monogamy (queens mating singly) is the ancestral state for all eusocial species so far investigated, so {{it is likely that}} haplodiploidy contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> of eusociality in bees.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{main points}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{transition}} from reptile <b>to</b> bird are <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> from scales <b>to</b> feathers, <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> of <b>the</b> beak (although independently evolved in other organisms), the hallofication of bones, development of flight, and warm-bloodedness.|$|R

5|$|Notable {{classical}} composers from Japan include Toru Takemitsu and Rentarō Taki. Popular {{music in}} post-war Japan has been {{heavily influenced by}} American and European trends, which has led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> of J-pop, or Japanese popular music. Karaoke is the most widely practiced cultural activity in Japan. A 1993 survey by the Cultural Affairs Agency found that more Japanese had sung karaoke that year than had participated in traditional pursuits such as flower arranging (ikebana) or tea ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Some {{eukaryotic}} protozoa such as Leishmania {{major and}} Trypanosoma cruzi lack the RNAi pathway entirely. Most {{or all of}} the components are also missing in some fungi, most notably the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The presence of RNAi in other budding yeast species such as Saccharomyces castellii and Candida albicans, further demonstrates that inducing two RNAi-related proteins from S. castellii facilitates RNAi in S. cerevisiae. That certain ascomycetes and basidiomycetes are missing RNA interference pathways indicates that proteins required for RNA silencing have been lost independently from many fungal lineages, possibly due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> of a novel pathway with similar function, or to the lack of selective advantage in certain niches.|$|E
5|$|Tiktaalik is a genus of extinct sarcopterygian (lobe-finned fish) {{from the}} Late Devonian period, with many {{features}} akin {{to those of}} tetrapods (four-legged animals).

Well-preserved fossils were found in 2004 on Ellesmere Island in Nunavut, Canada.|$|E

The services opened with the motorway in 1962 and have undergone many developments over time, largely due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> of the motorway, which {{at the time of its}} opening ran from Birmingham to Strensham but now runs to Exeter some 100 miles southwards.

5|$|Viral {{recombination}} produces {{genetic variation}} that likely contributes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> {{of resistance to}} anti-retroviral therapy. Recombination may also contribute, in principle, to overcoming the immune defenses of the host. Yet, for the adaptive advantages of genetic variation to be realized, the two viral genomes packaged in individual infecting virus particles need to have arisen from separate progenitor parental viruses of differing genetic constitution. It is unknown how often such mixed packaging occurs under natural conditions.|$|E
5|$|Also notable are the spiracles {{on the top}} of the head, which {{suggest the}} {{creature}} had primitive lungs as well as gills. This attribute would have been useful in shallow water, where higher water temperature would lower oxygen content. This development may have led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> of a more robust ribcage, a key evolutionary trait of land-living creatures. The more robust ribcage of Tiktaalik would have helped support the animal’s body any time it ventured outside a fully aquatic habitat. Tiktaalik also lacked a characteristic that most fishes havebony plates in the gill area that restrict lateral head movement. This makes Tiktaalik the earliest known fish to have a neck, with the pectoral girdle separate from the skull. This would give the creature more freedom in hunting prey either on land or in the shallows.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, J.Scott Turner and C.Richard Tracy {{proposed}} that {{the evolution of a}} sail in Dimetrodon was related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> of warm-bloodedness in mammal ancestors. They thought that the sail of Dimetrodon enabled it to be homeothermic, maintaining a constant, albeit low, body temperature. Mammals are also homeothermic, although they differ from Dimetrodon in being endothermic, controlling their body temperature internally through heightened metabolism. Turner and Tracy noted that early therapsids, a more advanced group of synapsids closely related to mammals, had long limbs which can release heat {{in a manner similar to}} that of the sail of Dimetrodon. The homeothermy that developed in animals like Dimetrodon may have carried over to therapsids through a modification of body shape, which would eventually develop into the warm-bloodedness of mammals.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to being a major source of variation, mutation may also function as a mechanism of evolution when there are different probabilities at the molecular level for different mutations to occur, a process known as mutation bias. If two genotypes, for example one with the nucleotide G and another with the nucleotide A in the same position, have the same fitness, but mutation from G to A happens more often than mutation from A to G, then genotypes with A will tend to evolve. Different insertion vs. deletion mutation biases in different taxa can lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> of different genome sizes. Developmental or mutational biases have also been observed in morphological evolution. For example, according to the phenotype-first theory of evolution, mutations can eventually cause the genetic assimilation of traits that were previously induced by the environment.|$|E
5|$|Modern radar scans many angles {{around the}} site. Reflectivity values at {{multiple}} angles {{above ground level}} in a storm are proportional to the precipitation rate at those levels. Summing reflectivities in the Vertically Integrated Liquid or VIL, gives the liquid water content in the cloud. Research shows that hail development in the upper levels of the storm is related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> of VIL. VIL divided by the vertical extent of the storm, called VIL density, has a relationship with hail size, although this varies with atmospheric conditions and therefore is not highly accurate. Traditionally, hail size and probability can be estimated from radar data by computer using algorithms based on this research. Some algorithms include {{the height of the}} freezing level to estimate the melting of the hailstone and what would be left on the ground.|$|E

5|$|Spain and {{subsequently}} Mexico controlled {{much of what}} is now the western United States until the Mexican–American War, including the entire state of Texas. After Texas joined the United States, the native Tejanos living in the state began culturally developing separately from their neighbors to the south, and remained culturally distinct from other Texans. Central <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> of early Tejano music was the blend of traditional Mexican forms such as mariachi and the corrido, and Continental European styles introduced by German and Czech settlers in the late 19th century. In particular, the accordion was adopted by Tejano folk musicians around the start of the 20th century, and it became a popular instrument for amateur musicians in Texas and Northern Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{discovery}} of the first Sphecomyrma fossils, there were no fossil records of any ants from Cretaceous amber and the oldest social insects at the time extended back to the Eocene epoch; the earliest known ant at the time was described from a forewing found in the Claiborne Formation in Tennessee. The great diversity of ant fossils found in the Baltic amber and Florissant shales of the Oligocene and in the Sicilian amber of the Miocene have prompted entomologists to search for ants of Cretaceous age that may link ants and non-social wasps together. Such a link may shed light on the early origins of ants, but no fossils of any social insect existed before S. freyi was discovered, thus the early evolution of ants remained a mystery. Only a single hymenopterous Upper Cretaceous fossil {{has been the subject of}} possible significance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> of aculeate wasps and ants. A single forewing was discovered in Siberia and described in 1957 as Cretavus sibiricus, with the author noting that the wing ventation closely resembles those of bethylid or scoliid wasps, of which these families of wasps have close connections with the origin of ants. However, there were several problems: as the fossil was only a single wing, scientists could not explain or answer whether or not the insect had key diagnostic body traits that would even place it within the subclade Aculeata.|$|E
