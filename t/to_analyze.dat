5|$|As {{the number}} of known {{specimens}} increased, scientists began <b>to</b> <b>analyze</b> the variation between individuals and discovered {{what appeared to be}} two distinct body types, or morphs, similar to some other theropod species. As one of these morphs was more solidly built, it was termed the 'robust' morph while the other was termed ''. Several morphological differences associated with the two morphs were used <b>to</b> <b>analyze</b> sexual dimorphism in Tyrannosaurus rex, with the 'robust' morph usually suggested to be female. For example, the pelvis of several 'robust' specimens seemed to be wider, perhaps to allow the passage of eggs. It was also thought that the 'robust' morphology correlated with a reduced chevron on the first tail vertebra, also ostensibly to allow eggs to pass out of the reproductive tract, as had been erroneously reported for crocodiles.|$|E

5|$|Even {{within the}} same phases, their self-assembled {{structures}} are tunable by the concentration: for example, in lamellar phases, the layer distances increase with the solvent volume. Since lyotropic liquid crystals rely on a subtle balance of intermolecular interactions, {{it is more difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>analyze</b> their structures and properties than those of thermotropic liquid crystals.|$|E

5|$|In Mission: Earth, Voyage to the Home Planet, {{astronaut}} Thomas David Jones recounts {{his experiences}} studying the Earth {{during his first}} mission with the United States space agency NASA. Jones' space mission lasted eleven days. Jones {{was a member of}} the crew of the Space Shuttle Endeavour, which left Earth in April 1994. The mission was intended to provide the Space Radar Lab with a view of the planet. By using three separate radar echoes, scientists were able <b>to</b> <b>analyze</b> a full image of the planet. The radar technology could penetrate obstructions, including clouds and thick outgrowth of trees. Another purpose of the mission was <b>to</b> <b>analyze</b> the ecological state of the planet and to take measurements of pollution caused by carbon monoxide.|$|E

5|$|Later, Allison {{acquired}} a 2 MeV Van de Graaff generator, and he recalled an old paper on producing lithium ions from minerals like Eucryptite. This {{allowed him to}} produce a 1.2 MeV lithium ion beam. He created hitherto unknown isotopes of boron and other light elements, and measured their neutron capture cross sections. A side effect of this work was a method <b>to</b> <b>analyze</b> surface materials where chemical analysis was unavailable. His colleague Anthony L. Turkevich subsequently used this <b>to</b> <b>analyze</b> {{the makeup of the}} Moon on the later Surveyor program missions. Allison continued to take on Ph.D. candidates, some of whom, such as James Cronin went on to distinguished careers.|$|E

50|$|In Britain and the United States, {{the study}} of {{political}} institutions dominated political science until after the post-war period. This approach, sometimes called 'old' institutionalism, focused on analyzing the formal institutions of government and the state in comparative perspective. After the behavioral revolution brought new perspectives <b>to</b> <b>analyzing</b> politics such as positivism, rational choice theory and behavioralism, the focus on institutions was discarded as it was too narrow. The focus moved <b>to</b> <b>analyzing</b> the individual rather than the institutions which surrounded him/her.|$|R
