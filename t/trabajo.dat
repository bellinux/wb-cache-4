5|$|The Spanish anarcho-syndicalists, {{who opposed}} the war out of doctrinaire cynicism and a belief that neither faction were on the workers' side, angrily repudiated their former idols (including Kropotkin, Malato and Grave) after {{discovering}} they had authored the manifesto. A small number of anarchists in Galicia and Asturias dissented and were heatedly denounced {{by the majority of}} Catalan anarcho-syndicalists (who prevailed in the anarchist union Confederación Nacional del <b>Trabajo).</b>|$|E
5|$|Arévalo's {{response}} {{toward the}} non-communist unions was mixed. In 1945, he criminalized all rural labor unions in workplaces {{with fewer than}} 500 workers, which included most plantations. One of the few unions big enough to survive this law was of the banana workers employed by the UFC. In 1946 this union organized a strike, which provoked Arévalo into outlawing all strikes until a new labor code was passed. This led to efforts {{on the part of}} employers to stall the labor code, as well as to exploit workers as far as possible before it was passed. The unions were also damaged when the US government persuaded the American Federation of Labor to found the Organización Regional Internacional del <b>Trabajo</b> (ORIT), a union that took a virulently anti-communist stance.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{targets of}} the {{operation}} were the personal possessions and documents of Jacobo Árbenz and those of Carlos Enrique Díaz (who had been chief {{of the armed forces}} under Árbenz, and briefly his successor as president), as well as the headquarters of the Partido Guatemalteco del <b>Trabajo</b> (PGT), and the offices of trade unions, known front organizations, and police agencies. The results of the initial searches were disappointing for the CIA; many of the offices had already been plundered both by the Guatemalan army and by other looters. The CIA were particularly interested in finding documents that mentioned the Árbenz's government's purchase of weapons from Czechoslovakia, but they were unsuccessful. They were also unsuccessful in finding any evidence that the Soviet Union had controlled the communist movement in Guatemala.|$|E

5|$|The repressive {{policies}} of the Ubico government resulted in a popular uprising led by university students and middle-class citizens in 1944. Ubico fled, handing over power to a three-person junta which continued Ubico's policies until it too was toppled, by the October Revolution that aimed to transform Guatemala into a liberal democracy. The largely free election that followed installed a philosophically conservative university professor, Juan José Arévalo, as the President of Guatemala. Arévalo's administration drafted a more liberal labor code, built health centers, and increased funding to education. Arévalo enacted a minimum wage, and created state-run farms to employ landless laborers. He also cracked down on the communist Guatemalan Party of Labour (Partido Guatemalteco del <b>Trabajo,</b> PGT) and in 1945 criminalized all labor unions in workplaces with fewer than 500 workers. By 1947, the remaining unions had grown strong enough to pressure him into drafting a new labor code, which made workplace discrimination illegal and created health and safety standards. However, Arévalo refused to advocate land reform of any kind, and stopped short of drastically changing labor relations in the countryside.|$|E

25|$|General Francisco Franco {{confined}} the UGT to {{exile and}} clandestinity after his {{victory in the}} Spanish Civil War {{until his death in}} 1975. The Union emerged from secrecy during the democratic transition after Franco's death, as did the communist Workers' Commissions (Comisiones Obreras, CCOO). The UGT and CCOO, between them, constitute the major avenues for workers' representation in today's Spain, with the anarcho-syndicalist Confederación General del <b>Trabajo</b> (CGT) a distant third.|$|E

25|$|Relgis {{enjoys a}} more {{enduring}} reputation abroad. Initially, his anarchist eugenics enjoyed some popularity among Spanish anarchists; his pacifism also inspired Llorenç Vidal Vidal, the Balearic poet and educator. Some of his tracts have been reissued after 2001, with the Anselmo Lorenzo Foundation (Confederación Nacional del <b>Trabajo).</b> Italian-language versions of his novels, poems and political tracts, including Cosmometápolis, were published by Gaspare Mancuso and his Libero Accordo group, over the 1960s and '70s.|$|E
25|$|In {{this first}} congress, held in Madrid, a {{minority}} sector {{in favor of}} union elections split from the CNT, initially calling themselves CNT Valencia Congress (referring to the alternative congress held in this city), and later Confederación General del <b>Trabajo</b> (CGT) after an April 1989 court decision determined {{that they could not}} use the CNT initials. In 1990, a group of CGT members left this union because they rejected the CGT's policy of accepting government subsidies, founding Solidaridad Obrera.|$|E
25|$|Starting in the 1930s, and {{following}} a general tendency in Latin America, nationalist ideas were fortified {{in the countryside}} and many diverse sectors of Argentina. Political parties such as the Unión Cívica Radical, the Socialist Party of Argentina, and in the unions organized {{under the umbrella of}} the Confederación General del <b>Trabajo</b> the favorable currents for the State to become interventionist were growing, in order to push the preservation on the national interests and promote industrialization.|$|E

25|$|The Republican {{forces were}} {{composed}} of 12,000 Andalusian militiamen (only 8,000 armed) of the National Confederation of Labour (Confederación Nacional del <b>Trabajo,</b> or CNT). Although large {{in number and}} high in spirit, the militiamen were completely unprepared for military warfare and there was strong antagonism between CNT and communist militiamen. In addition, they lacked the weapons to sustain a successful defense against the modern weapons of the Italians. Malaga lacked anti-aircraft defenses, the militiamen did not build trenches or road blocks {{and there was a}} lack of ammunition.|$|E
25|$|The patrimonial {{dependency}} (dependencia patrimonial) of {{a hospital}} (or other health care facility) is the individual or other juridical entity that owns, at least, the building occupied by the facility. Hospitals that are under the dependency of Spanish Social Security belong primarily to the General Treasury of Social Security, {{although there is a}} special group within Social Security for the Mutuals of Accidents and Occupational Diseases (Mutuas de Accidentes de <b>Trabajo</b> y Enfermedades Profesionales, MATEP). There are also a few cases where patrimony is shared by two or more public entities on a consortium basis.|$|E
25|$|After {{the flight}} of King Alfonso XIII (r. 1886–1931), the Second Spanish Republic was {{established}} on 14 April 1931, led by President Niceto Alcalá-Zamora, whose government instituted a program of secular reforms, which included agrarian reform, {{the separation of church}} and state, the right to divorce, women's suffrage (November 1933), the socio-political reformation of the Spanish Army, and political autonomy for Catalonia and the Basque Country (October 1936). President Alcalá-Zamora’s reforms to Spanish society were continually blocked by the right-wing parties and rejected by the far-left-wing National Confederation of Labour (CNT, Confederación Nacional del <b>Trabajo).</b> The Second Spanish Republic suffered attacks from the right wing (the failed coup d'état of Sanjurjo in 1932), and the left wing (the Asturian miners' strike of 1934), whilst perduring the economic impact of the Great Depression.|$|E

25|$|During World War I era, the UGT {{followed}} a tactical line of close relationship and unity of action with the Confederación Nacional del <b>Trabajo</b> (CNT, National Labour Confederation). This era {{came to a}} sudden end {{with the advent of}} the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, who gave a legal monopoly on labor organizing to his own government-sponsored union. While the CNT opted for a radical confrontation with the regime, and were prohibited on this account, the UGT, although in disagreement with the dictatorship, adopted a collaborative attitude in order to continue to operate legally. The radicalization during the period of the Second Spanish Republic of the wing led by Francisco Largo Caballero, when the UGT surpassed a million members, and the bloody breakout of the Spanish Civil War deepened the internal fissures that resulted in the departure of Largo Caballero from the position of UGT secretary general in 1937.|$|E
25|$|During the 1933 electoral {{campaign}} Arellano was included as Carlist candidate on the Navarrese Union of the Right coalition; he was comfortably elected with 72 thousand votes and together with José Luis Zamanillo {{became one of}} the youngest Traditionalist deputies ever. In great national politics Arellano followed Rodezno and his policy of seeking alliance within a broad monarchist grouping, first in coalition named as TYRE and later having signed manifiesto constitutivo of Bloque Nacional; he remained active in the latter despite discouragement from the emerging Carlist leader, Manuel Fal Conde. Another thread of his activity was a penchant for social focus. In the early 1930s Arellano was already engaged in rural arbitration bodies like Jurado Mixto del <b>Trabajo</b> Rural and Catholic-sponsored labor organizations like Federación Católico-Social Navarra and Sindicatos Obreros Profesionales. Partially as representative of these organizations he entered Grupo Social Parliamentario. Finally, in the Cortes he was very active fighting comisión gestora and demanding re-establishment of Diputación Foral de Navarra.|$|E
25|$|Political {{parties and}} trade unions were {{forbidden}} {{except for the}} government party, Traditionalist Spanish Falange and Offensive of the Unions of the National-Syndicalist (Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista or FET de las JONS), and the official trade union Spanish Trade Union Organisation (Sindicato Vertical). Hundreds of militants and supporters of the parties and trade unions declared illegal under Franco's dictatorship, such as the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (Partido Socialista Obrero Español), PSOE; the Communist Party of Spain (Partido Comunista de España), PCE; the Workers' General Union (Unión General de Trabajadores), UGT; and the National Confederation of Labor (Confederación Nacional del <b>Trabajo),</b> CNT, were imprisoned or executed. The regional languages, like Basque and Catalan, were also forbidden, and the statutes of autonomy of Catalonia and the Basque country were abolished. Censorship of the press (the Law of Press, passed in April 1938) and of cultural life was rigorously exercised and forbidden books destroyed.|$|E
