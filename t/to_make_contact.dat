5|$|Individuals who are {{intentional}} {{in their}} actions display regularity in their behavior. Individuals locate objects with their eyes, move towards the object, {{and then use}} hands <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> with and manipulate the object. Change in gaze direction {{is one of several}} behavioral cues that individuals use in combination with changes in facial and vocal displays and body posture to mark the intention to act on an object. Individuals who seek or follow a joint focus of attention display knowledge that what is in their awareness is also in another's awareness. They believe that they are experiencing the same world as others.|$|E

5|$|Realising {{that foreign}} support would be {{necessary}} for {{the continued existence of}} the United Belgian States, the Statists tried <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> with foreign powers they believed to be sympathetic. Despite numerous attempts, however, the revolution failed to gain foreign support. The Dutch were not interested and, although the Prussian king, Frederick William II, was sympathetic and did send some troops to aid the revolutionaries in July, Prussia was also forced to withdraw its forces under combined Austrian and British pressure.|$|E

More backstory on the Others, {{as well as the}} Dharma Initiative, is revealed. The survivors face continuous threats from their enemies, and also from their friends. The survivors attempt <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> with a freighter which they believe is there to rescue them. Season three takes place over 24 days.|$|E
5|$|The British had {{witnessed}} the Polish drop but were unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> by radio so a swimmer was sent {{south of the}} Rhine.

The second corner was crossed in towards Piqué, but he was unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> with the ball.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, the Harwich Force sortied {{on the night}} of 23–24 October in {{response}} to the German transfer of two flotillas of torpedo boats to Zeebrugge, in occupied Belgium, but failed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> with the German ships. The Admiralty ordered Tyrwhitt to detach Carysfort and four destroyers to reinforce Vice-Admiral Reginald Bacon's Dover Patrol as they feared that the transfer was in preparation for a concerted attack on the shipping protected by the latter. Three nights later, the newly arrived German destroyers did exactly what the Admiralty feared and attacked. Carysfort played no role in the resulting action, but was kept in reserve and helped to search for damaged vessels the following morning. German destroyers made another attack {{on the night of}} 20/21 April 1917 and were driven off, losing two destroyers, without the cruiser's intervention.|$|E

Before he is able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> with her, he is detained by Skinner and two FBI agents.

5|$|Ariel first {{appears in}} The Little Mermaid (1989), {{in which she}} is shown as being adventurous and curious about the world of humans, a fascination which angers both her father King Triton and his court {{composer}} Sebastian, as merfolk are not allowed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> with the human world. She and Flounder go in search of human objects, which they take to a seagull named Scuttle for appraisal. Ariel {{falls in love with}} a human prince named Prince Eric after saving him from drowning, and visits the sea witch, Ursula, who agrees to turn her into a human in exchange for her voice. Ariel must make Prince Eric fall in love with her and romantically kiss her within three days, lest she belong to Ursula forever.|$|E
5|$|As {{the wine}} {{business}} began to prosper, Schnaufer also gave thought to alternative employment possibilities in peacetime aviation. With his wartime friend Hermann Greiner, he traveled from Weil am Rhein to Bern in Switzerland to meet South American diplomats; the two {{hoped to find}} employment as pilots in South America. To get to Bern, they crossed the Swiss-German border illegally. The meeting was a failure. As they returned to Germany, they were caught by Swiss border guards attempting to make a second illegal border crossing. The Swiss handed {{them over to the}} French occupation authorities and they were imprisoned in Lörrach, where they remained until Schnaufer managed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> with a French general, who was a customer of the Schnaufer winery and had them released. This misadventure kept him away from his business for about half a year.|$|E
5|$|Barrichello placed blame upon Frentzen for {{starting}} the lap one accident at the Variante della Roggia corner. He demanded that Frentzen be banned for ten races. Barrichello also added that his helmet was damaged from his collision with de la Rosa. Frentzen reacted {{by suggesting that}} Barrichello braked earlier which forced him <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> with teammate Trulli. FIA Race Director Charlie Whiting defended his decision not to stop the race saying that the safety car was deployed as all cars involved were in the run-off areas and that he believed stopping the race would be dangerous. However, {{he admitted that he}} was not aware about Gislimberti's condition when making the decision. Jordan team principal Eddie Jordan believed that Whiting had made the right decision and praised the safety of the modern Formula One car for protecting drivers.|$|E

5|$|In July 1942, South West Pacific Area, {{became aware}} of the {{resistance}} movements forming in occupied Philippines through attempted radio communications to Allies outside of the Philippines; by late 1942, couriers had made it to Australia confirming the existence of the resistance. By December 1942, SWPA sent Captain Jesús A. Villamor to the Philippines <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> with guerrilla organizations, eventually developing extensive intelligence networks including contacts within the Second Republic Government. In addition, through the Allied Intelligence Bureau's Philippine Regional Section, SWPA began to send operatives, and equipment, into the Philippines <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> and supply guerrilla organizations. Unique to other guerrillas in the Philippines were the Wa Chi; a resistance unit composed of Filipino-Chinese and Chinese immigrants. They were established to counter the Japanese suspicion and abuse of the Chinese living in the country, and had over 700 men strong. The movement was aided by the American guerrilla forces and were also supported by anti-Japanese civilians and farmers living in the outskirts. In Nueva Ecija, guerrillas led by Juan Pajota and Eduardo Joson protected the U.S. Army Rangers and Alamo Scouts who were conducting a rescue mission of Allied POWS from a counterattack by Japanese reinforcements. Pajota and the Filipino guerrillas received Bronze Stars for their role in the raid. Among the guerrilla units, the Blue Eagles were a specialized unit established for landmine and sniper detection, as well as in hunting Japanese spies who have blended in with the civilian population.|$|E
5|$|In {{carrying}} out Eighth Army's orders {{to block the}} Poun road, regimental commander Colonel John H. Michaelis, a West Point graduate known as an effective commander, assigned the 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> with the first North Korean attacks. On the morning of July 23, Lieutenant Colonel Gilbert J. Check moved the 1st Battalion northward toward Poun from the Hwanggan assembly area. He took up defensive positions in the evening {{near the village of}} Sangyong-ni, south of Poun. The battalion assumed responsibility for that sector at 17:00 after South Korean troops fell back through its position. However, the battalion was unable to ascertain from the retreating soldiers the NK 2nd Division's status or threat.|$|E
5|$|In the Halo universe, {{humans had}} {{advanced}} to a comparable level {{of technology to}} the Forerunners but, after losing a war with them, all human technology was destroyed and their intelligence reduced, leaving them in a subsistence economy with measures to prevent redevelopment of electronics. Humans {{are aware of the}} other, space-faring races, but their interactions are limited to visits from Forerunners as {{they do not have the}} technology <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> themselves, they live in wooden buildings and have only primitive steam engines. The San'Shyuum (or Prophets as they are referred to in the Halo games) were also defeated by the Forerunners but their technology was not destroyed; they were instead confined to their home solar system and forbidden to manufacture weapons.|$|E
