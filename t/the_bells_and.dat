5|$|Christ Church, {{although}} a larger building than St John's, {{is the daughter}} church in Radyr. Designed by the Llandaff diocesan surveyor George Halliday, the nave was ready for use at Easter 1904 and the chancel and tower were completed in November 1910. Also in 1910 John Taylor & Co of Loughborough cast a ring of eight bells for the tower. Lieutenant Colonel Fisher paid for <b>the</b> <b>bells,</b> <b>and</b> each bell is inscribed {{with the names of}} members of his family.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{widening}} {{of the tower}} arches in 1270 and 1320 the tower of St.Mary's had been structurally weak. The subsequent addition of <b>the</b> <b>bells</b> <b>and</b> belfry and the lead-covered spire added to {{the weight of the}} tower, and the number of burials of local notables within the church and of parishioners immediately outside the church building weakened the structure further. By the 18th century the problems had become severe enough that the west arch of the south transept was blocked up in an effort the strengthen the structure, and a hollow pillar which housed the stairway to the rood loft was filled in. The tower continued to weaken, a situation made worse by the addition in 1812 of a new ring of six bells with a 17cwt(860kg) tenor bell, cast by Thomas Mears II of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. Iron bands were wrapped around the tower to strengthen it but these soon snapped, and by the 19th century large cracks, which had appeared in the tower, were filled with broken bricks and rubble and covered over with roughcast as an interim solution.|$|E

25|$|Josephus' {{explanation}} is this: The coat was {{the symbol of}} the earth, the upper garment emblemized heaven, while <b>the</b> <b>bells</b> <b>and</b> pomegranates represented thunder and lightning. The ephod typified the four elements, and the interwoven gold denoted the glory of God. The breastplate was {{in the center of the}} ephod, as the earth formed the center of the universe; the girdle symbolized the ocean, the stones on the shoulders the sun and moon, and the jewels in the breastplate the twelve signs of the zodiac, while the miter was a token of heaven.|$|E
25|$|The Trinity Lutheran Church {{was founded}} in 1851 in the Lutheran-All Faiths Cemetery. A school {{was founded in}} the church in 1861, and the church burned just two years later. Then, it moved to 69th Street. At the 69th Street site, the school burned down in 1895 and the church burned down in 1906. Another church {{was built on the}} 69th Street site, but it was {{structurally}} damaged by lightning damage in 1975 and completely burned in a 1977 fire. The church's third structure, built in 1979, is located on a plot of land bounded by present-day Penelope Avenue, Dry Harbor Road, Juniper Boulevard South, and 81st Street. <b>The</b> <b>bells</b> <b>and</b> cornerstones from the first two churches are the only remnants of the original structures, and are located in front of the original church.|$|E

25|$|The carillonneur or carillonist is {{the title}} of the {{musician}} who plays the carillon. The carillonneur usually sits in a cabin beneath <b>the</b> <b>bells</b> <b>and</b> presses down, with a loosely closed fist, on a series of baton-like keys arranged in the same pattern as a piano keyboard. The batons are almost never played with the fingers as one does a piano, though this is sometimes used as a special carillon playing technique. The keys activate levers and wires that connect directly to the bells' clappers; thus, as with a piano, the carillonneur can vary the intensity of the note according to the force applied to the key. In addition to the manual keys, the heavier bells are also played with a pedal keyboard. These notes can either be played with the hands or the feet.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, more record {{companies}} and artists began making video clips for their music {{than in the}} past, realizing the popularity of MTV and the growing medium. In keeping with the influx of videos, MTV announced changes to its playlists in the November 3, 1984, issue of Billboard magazine, that would take effect the following week.

500|$|Note also Peter Lightfoot's Wells Cathedral clock, {{constructed}} c.1390.

Above the clock {{is a set of}} figures, which hit <b>the</b> <b>bells,</b> <b>and</b> a set of jousting knights who revolve around a track every 15minutes. The clock was converted to pendulum-and-anchor escapement in the 17th century, and was installed in London's Science Museum in 1884, where it continues to operate. [...] Similar astronomical clocks, or horologes, survive at Exeter, Ottery St Mary, and Wimborne Minster.|$|E

500|$|Opinion on For Your Eyes Only has {{not changed}} {{with the passing of}} time and the reviews are still mixed: as of October 2015, the film holds a 74% 'fresh' rating from Rotten Tomatoes, being ranked twelfth among the 22 Bond films. Ian Nathan of Empire gives the film only two of a {{possible}} five stars, observing that the film [...] "still ranks {{as one of the most}} forgettable Bonds on record." [...] In 2006, IGN chose For Your Eyes Only as the sixth best Bond film, claiming it is [...] "a good old-fashioned espionage tale", a placement shared by Norman Wilner of MSN, who considered it [...] "the one Moore film that seems to reach back to Connery's heyday", and Entertainment Weekly chose it as the tenth best in 2008, saying it was a [...] "return to low-tech, low-key Bond ... some of the best stunts since the early days". In October 2008 Time Out re-issued a review of For Your Eyes Only and observed that the film is [...] "admirable in intent" [...] but that it [...] "feels a little spare", largely because the plot has been [...] "divested of <b>the</b> <b>bells</b> <b>and</b> whistles that hallmark the franchise".|$|E

Eurogamer's Oli Welsh said that the game avoids the normal pitfalls that developers introduce in sequels, stating that [...] "Portal is perfect. Portal 2 is not. It's something better than that.". Gus Mastrapa of The A.V. Club wrote that with Portal 2, Valve had alleviated any doubts that [...] "Portal could be expanded into a big, narrative experience with all <b>the</b> <b>bells</b> <b>and</b> whistles of a mainstream gaming hit".

[...] According to Ryan, Lazzara [...] "changed his style a bit" [...] and [...] "occasionally sound like his jaw is wired shut." [...] Entertainment Weekly reviewer Clark Collis wrote that the album's title [...] "justifies its name thanks to a chunkier array of riffs and choruses" [...] compared to Where You Want to Be. Sarah Dean wrote on FasterLouder that Louder Now differs from the band's past records; it has [...] "a darker mood, bigger choruses and perhaps even catchier melodies," [...] with the [...] "emo-pop punk flavour Taking Back Sunday are renowned for." [...] Gigwise contributor Lee Glynn wrote that the album had [...] "no standout tracks" [...] other than [...] "MakeDamnSure." [...] Apart from the latter, [...] "there is nothing on this album that reaffirms them as a band full of malice and bite." [...] Spence D. of IGN gave the album a score of 6.7 out of 10: [...] "It's a safe bet to say that TBS diehards will soak up the 11 tracks with a sponge-like vengeance. Newcomers may wonder what all <b>the</b> <b>bells</b> <b>and</b> whistles are about, though. But tracks like 'My Blue Heaven', 'Spin', 'Divine Intervention' and 'I'll Let You Live' promise even greater things to come from this band, who are only now hinting at their growing sonic maturity." ...|$|E

[...] Carolyn Menyes of the Music Times applauded Grande for her calming vocals and transition into a more mature sound of music. Billboards Jason Lipshutz called the production [...] "impressive" [...] and said the song [...] "rows stickier upon each listen". Digital Spy writer Lewis Corner and Entertainmentwise's Shaun Kitchener noted the song showed her R roots, the latter stating that it [...] "wouldn't have sounded out of place on Kelly Rowland's under-rated last album [...]" [...] The Official Charts Company critic Rob Copsey felt it was [...] "like an extension of Yours Truly, albeit moodier and more grown up." [...] Brennan Carley of Spin called it [...] "classic Grande, eshcewing any of <b>the</b> <b>bells</b> <b>and</b> whistles that she's fond of, instead focusing entirely on her carefully sung vocals and the quiet piano line in the song's background." [...] Newsday critic Glenn Gamboa described [...] "Best Mistake" [...] as a [...] "gorgeous hip-hop" [...] song that [...] "showcases her wide-ranging voice, without focusing on the upper notes too much."

500|$|Millionaire socialite Henry J. [...] "Bob" [...] Topping Jr. (1948–1952). A {{brother of}} New York Yankees owner Dan Topping and a {{grandson}} of tin-plate magnate Daniel G. Reid, Topping proposed to Turner at the 21 Club in Los Angeles by dropping a diamond ring into her martini. The ceremony occurred {{three days after}} Topping was divorced from his third wife, actress Arline Judge, who had been previously married to his brother Dan. Although worth millions when they married, Topping suffered heavy financial losses due to poor investments and excessive gambling. The couple's marriage resulted in a church trial for the officiant because the marriage took place {{less than a year}} after Topping's divorce from Judge. Cheryl Crane writes in her memoir that her mother's wedding to Bob Topping was a beautiful, lavish affair held in the spacious Topping family mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut, with all of <b>the</b> <b>bells</b> <b>and</b> whistles accompanying a traditional wedding. Despite the fact that both the bride and the groom had been married and divorced multiple times previously, Lana wore a traditional white gown, the bridesmaids wore equally beautiful gowns of Lana's choosing, and young Cheryl served as the flower girl. Crane goes on to state that she later saw this as her mother's attempt to finally have a beautiful, traditional wedding while she was still young after three failed marriages (to Artie Shaw and Steve Crane) in which the ceremonies took place before justices of the peace with Lana usually attired in a simple dress suit and heels.|$|E
