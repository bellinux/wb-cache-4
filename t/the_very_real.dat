5|$|Following {{the orders}} of {{the captain of the}} Barracouta, Waddell {{immediately}} converted the warship back to a merchant ship, storing her cannon below, discharging all arms, and repainting the hull. At this point, Waddell decided to sail back to England and surrender the Shenandoah in Liverpool. Surrendering in an American port carried the certainty of facing a court with a Union point of view and <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> risk of a trial for piracy, for which he and the crew could be hanged. Sailing south around Cape Horn and staying well off shore to avoid shipping that might report Shenandoah's position, they saw no land for another 9,000 miles until they arrived back in England, having logged a total of over 58,000 miles around the world in a year's travel—the only Confederate ship to circumnavigate the globe.|$|E
5|$|Gebhard clearly {{intended}} to transform an important ecclesiastical territory into a secular, dynastic duchy. This problematic conversion would then bring {{the principle of}} cuius regio, eius religio into play in the Electorate. Under this principle, all of Gebhard's subjects {{would be required to}} convert to his faith: his rule, his religion. Furthermore, as a relatively young man, heirs would be expected. Gebhard and his young wife presented <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> possibility of successfully converting a rich, diplomatically important and strategically placed ecclesiastical territory of a prince-prelate into a dynastic territory that carried with it one of the coveted offices of imperial elector.|$|E
5|$|In April 1878, L'Estrange reappeared on the Australian {{scene with}} a new {{performance}} – gas ballooning. The first balloon ascent in Australia {{had been made in}} Melbourne in 1853, with Sydney following five years later in December 1858. The idea that people could be lifted from the ground to fly and return safely fired the imagination of the public, and the novelty of balloon ascents continued to draw large crowds through the 1860s and 1870s. No doubt <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> chance of disaster and injury added to the crowd's keen interest, as mishaps were not uncommon.|$|E

5|$|Due to Tom's illness, Falcon-Price {{takes over}} the {{operation}} of the station and the team must deal with his constant presence and the pressure which they are put under. Falcon-Price's constant attempts to prove that Tom is not up to his job have also grown more intense at Tom's initial sign of weakness. We see that Alex is having trouble dealing with his new role as a father, and, on top of this, Alex is stabbed by a criminal, and this begins to look as if it is all Tom's fault. The two rivals, Kelly and Joss, enter into new romances: Joss with a pickpocket victim and Kelly with a rival lawyer. They must deal with their constant jealousy of each other and their constant drive to outdo each other, as it had been ever since they left the Academy. Joss must also deal with his growing gambling debts and the consequences of these, including his being beaten up, his being forced to get a second job and his becoming homeless. He must also deal with the people around him who, in trying to help him, make him feel worse; particularly the arrival of his mother in town. Dismissed police officer Adam Cooper also arrives back in Mount Thomas, {{for the first time since}} Tom dismissed him in 1998. This time he arrives in Mount Thomas as a photocopier technician and wants to take revenge on Tom. In an attempt to do this, he tries to frame him for a crime he did not commit. In the heat of these allegations against Mount Thomas' top cop, there is <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> possibility that the Mount Thomas police station may be closed forever, and the team are forced to find new placements and the possibility of separation from one another.|$|E

25|$|The unmanageably {{high number}} of corpses strewn all over the cities and countrysides, limited {{resources}} and time for identifying bodies, and <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> threat of cholera, diphtheria and other diseases prompted emergency workers to create makeshift mass graves.

25|$|Additional {{causes of}} the Gaelic revival were {{political}} and personal grievances against the Hiberno-Normans, but especially impatience with procrastination and <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> horrors that successive famines had brought. Pushed away from the fertile areas, the Irish were forced to eke out a subsistence living on marginal lands, which left them with no safety net during bad harvest years (such as 1271 and 1277) or in a year of famine (virtually the entire period of 1311–1319).|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Yolngu of {{northeast}} Arnhem Land were taking their grievances to the courts, {{in the case}} of Milirrpum v Nabalco, after unsuccessfully petitioning the Commonwealth government with a bark petition. The judge's decision in Gove had relied on the doctrine of terra nullius to deny the Yolngu rights to their land and ensure the security of a bauxite mine by Nabalco. Coupled with the ongoing Gurindji strike, this case highlighted <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> need for Aboriginal land rights in Australia.|$|E

25|$|Both {{meanings}} can {{be politically}} charged. Using {{the second to}} the exclusion of the first may be considered offensive to some in that it excludes francophones born in or with ethnic origins from other countries, such as Haiti, Vietnam or Tunisia, from the Franco-Ontarian community. Using the first {{to the exclusion of}} the second obscures <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> ethno-cultural distinctions that exist between Franco-Ontarians, Québécois, Acadians, Métis and other Canadian francophone communities, and the pressures toward assimilation into the English Canadian majority that the community faces.|$|E
25|$|Finkel's opponents {{argued that}} the pure focus on the Talmud would {{automatically}} create greatness in both scholarship and ethics. But Finkel believed that, while {{this might have been}} true in previous generations, the modern age was different. In his view, too many new enticing secular ideologies, such as Socialism and Zionism and <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> lure of atheism in universities, were becoming a replacement for traditional Judaism for many young Jews. He was determined to prove that what he had to offer was more appealing than anything the outside world could offer.|$|E
25|$|By November 1928, a Canadian company, International Airways, {{had taken}} {{over control of the}} {{airfield}} from Mount Vernon Airways. Despite its small size, three foreign flights per day left Hoover Field, and in the 18 months prior to December 1928 the airport saw more than 50,000 flights depart. In June 1928, it set an area record for sending 4,200 passengers aloft in a single month. But these statistics belied <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> dangers at the field. In 1928, a pilot and engineer were killed when their plane crashed during take-off. Later that year, a plane attempting to land at night struck a car parked on the field, injuring four.|$|E

It was a little belated, perhaps, like a rose {{blooming}} in October which should have bloomed in June; but none the less a rose, all sweetness and fragrance, with the gleam of gold in its heart. Never did Anne's feet bear her on a more willing errand than on that walk through the beechwoods to Grafton the next morning. She found Miss Lavendar in the garden. Anne was fearfully excited. Her hands grew cold and her voice trembled.|$|R

25|$|Rickover {{found himself}} {{frequently}} and loudly in bureaucratic combat with these senior naval officers, {{to the point}} that he almost missed becoming an admiral: two selection boards passed over Captain Rickover for promotion. One of these selection boards even met the day after USS Nautilus had its keel-laying ceremony in the presence of President Truman — and indicative of the Navy's attitude toward the ship's creator, Rickover had not been originally invited and was only eventually invited by way of his AEC role, not his Navy role. It eventually took the intervention of the White House, U.S. Congress, and the Secretary of the Navy— and <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> threat of changing the Navy's admiral-selection system to include civilians— before the next flag-selection board welcomed the twice passed-over Rickover (normally a career-ending event) into their ranks.|$|E
25|$|However, given <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> {{possibility}} of a limp, constant and/or debilitating pain, complicated treatment and impaired mobility later in life, careful developmental monitoring is indicated and early intervention is often the result. The worst possible consequence of non treatment is developing early arthritis, sometimes even during teenage years. All treatment aims to delay the onset of arthritis, but no treatment is fully successful in avoiding it; and, all available treatments bear the risk of inflicting equivalent damage. Most unfortunately, studies have as yet {{been unable to find}} a method of predicting outcomes in either the surgical/orthopedic treatment of the condition in infants and young children, or the surgical treatment of these early treatments' negative outcomes later in life (such as arthritis, avascular necrosis, trochanteric bursitis, and bone spurs of up to 2cm just medial of the gluteus maximus insertion point on the greater trochanter due to excessive friction).|$|E
25|$|In 2005, the NCAA {{purchased}} 10-year {{rights to}} the NIT from the MIBA for $56.5 million to settle an antitrust lawsuit, which had gone to trial and was being argued until very shortly before the settlement was announced. The MIBA alleged that compelling teams to accept invitations to the NCAA tournament even if they preferred {{to play in the}} NIT was an illegal use of the NCAA's powers. In addition, it argued that the NCAA's expansion of its tournament to 65 teams (68 since 2011) was designed specifically to bankrupt the NIT. Faced with <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> possibility of being found in violation of federal antitrust law {{for the third time in}} its history, the NCAA chose to settle. (The first two violations were related to restrictions on televising college football and capping assistant coach salaries.) As part of the purchase of the NIT by the NCAA, the MIBA disbanded.|$|E

25|$|Apart {{from the}} 1948 Arab-Israeli War, when {{manpower}} shortages saw many Palmach and IDF women taking {{active part in}} land battles, women were historically barred from battle in the IDF, serving {{in a variety of}} technical and administrative support roles. Soon after the establishment of the IDF, the removal of all women from front-line positions was decreed. Decisive for this decision was <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> possibility of falling into enemy hands as prisoners of war. It was fair and equitable to demand from women equal sacrifice and risk, it was argued, but the risk for women prisoners of rape and sexual molestation was infinitely greater than the same risk for men. A majority of women serving in the IDF then were secretaries. The rest served primarily as instructors, nurses, clerks and telephone operators. A few women flew transport missions in the 1950s and a few women were accepted into flight training in the 1970s, but did not complete the program before it was closed to women.|$|E
