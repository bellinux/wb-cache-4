5|$|Mr Albert is Galaxity's contact on 20th century Earth. He {{makes his}} first {{appearance}} in Métro Châtelet, Direction Cassiopeia. He is a retired gentleman who drives an obsolete Renault 4CV and lives {{in the suburbs of}} Paris, France. He maintains a wide range of contacts in government and scientific circles as well as with many experts in fields outside the mainstream such as ufology, telepathy, and sorcery. He is also a pigeon fancier and uses his carrier pigeons to relay messages between some of his contacts. Unlike Valérian he tries to avoid getting involved {{in the thick of the}} action and never acts impulsively, always preferring to take his time about things. He enjoys the finer things in life: gourmet cuisine, fine wines and likes to <b>take</b> <b>things</b> easy.|$|E

5|$|Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) tells Aden that {{he should}} behave in a manner his {{grandfather}} would be proud of. This upsets Aden, and he tries to cause trouble at school. When Cassie discovers she has HIV, Aden becomes irate at the prospect {{that she may have}} infected him in the car accident. After his tests come back negative, he cries in disappointment. His doctor, Rachel Armstrong (Amy Mathews), suggests that Aden may need counselling, but he refuses. When Aden's alcoholic father Larry throws him out, he is taken in by his friend Roman. Aden is upset to learn that Roman was in the army like his grandfather, and visits the structurally damaged local diner to be alone. The ceiling collapses and Aden is seriously injured. In the aftermath, Larry tells Rachel that Aden was abused by his grandfather as a child. Aden cannot face going home, so moves in with Roman more permanently. He is attracted to Roman's daughter Nicole, but does not pursue her out of respect for Roman. Instead, Aden kisses Belle, but deflects her attempts to <b>take</b> <b>things</b> further. She goes on a date with Angelo Rosetta (Luke Jacobz), which prompts a jealous Aden to admit that he could not sleep with her because of the abuse he suffered as a child. When Larry injures himself while drunk, he is found by his son, and admits that Aden's grandfather also abused him. Aden holds Larry, Rachel and Belle hostage so that his father cannot receive medical assistance, but they are rescued by Angelo. Aden is forced into counselling, and begins {{to come to terms with}} his abuse.|$|E
5|$|Someone paints butts on Pam Halpert's (Jenna Fischer) {{warehouse}} mural. Distraught, she {{demands to}} know the vandal's identity, but the warehouse workers remain silent to protect their coworker. She then tries appealing to the sympathies of the other office workers, but with her husband Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) off in Philadelphia, only Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) show any interest. The three lure warehouse worker Nate (Mark Proksch) upstairs and interrogate him in isolation; Nate soon cracks and identifies Frank (Brad William Henke) as the vandal. They take the matter to human resources, and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) holds a meeting between the involved parties. Pam, presumably at Toby's suggestion, apologizes for having possibly infringed on Frank's space by using the warehouse to paint her mural, but Frank in response insults Pam and her mural using vulgar language and insists that his drawing of butts was funny. Toby and Nelly both take Frank's side, so Pam and Dwight <b>take</b> <b>things</b> {{into their own hands}} by painting a grotesque nude man on Frank's truck with washable paint. As Pam tells the documentary crew that she feels it is appropriate that she used her art to enact her revenge for the vandalism, Frank shows up yelling in anger and lunges at Pam. Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos), the crew's boom mic operator, intervenes by hitting Frank across the face with his mic. Frank and Brian are subsequently fired by their respective employers. As Brian leaves, he tells Pam that he will always be there for her if she needs someone.|$|E

It is the planet of day-to-day expression and relationships. Mercury's action is to <b>take</b> <b>things</b> apart and put them back together again. It is an opportunistic planet, decidedly unemotional and curious.|$|E

25|$|While a few {{writers and}} {{researchers}} {{have tried to}} assign such a retrospective diagnosis to Turing, {{and it is true}} that he had his share of eccentricities, the Asperger's-like traits portrayed in the film – social awkwardness, difficulty working cooperatively with others, and tendency to <b>take</b> <b>things</b> too literally – bear little relationship to the actual adult Turing, who, despite enjoying working alone, was sociable and had friends, was also viewed as having a sense of humour, and had good working relationships with colleagues.|$|E
25|$|After {{several months}} {{living with the}} Riglers, Genie's {{behavior}} and social skills improved {{to the point that}} she started going to first a nursery school and then a public school for mentally retarded children her age. The Riglers also taught her some basic self-help skills, including simple chores such as ironing, using a sewing machine, and preparing simple meals for herself. She made substantial progress with controlling herself both at home and in public, and although it was extremely hard to prevent her socially inappropriate masturbation she had almost entirely ceased it by the end of her stay. In February 1973 Curtiss recorded the first time Genie shared something with her, and while she continued to <b>take</b> <b>things</b> from other people her responses clearly indicated that she knew she was not supposed to.|$|E
25|$|The {{good news}} is, I'm finally {{working on my}} debut retail album. It sounds amazing so far. Everyone is excited about it. The bad news is, no more free music. Odds are, ever. No loopholes. Which means, Vampire Sunlight {{might be the last}} free release, and The Evil Microchip will not drop. Not even on YouTube. Sorry, Markus. But a major thank you is in order for {{everyone}} who's helped me this far. Everyone from Boe and Dre to Jimmy Iovine. All the graphic designers who have made covers, all the fans who uploaded my music, everyone. Thank you. My digital revolution has taken the Galaxy by storm, and I'm proud of it. It's just time to <b>take</b> <b>things</b> to a higher level. Hopefully, yall will support me. I'm not gonna throw the fact you've heard all my secrets for free in your face. But honestly, I would personally appreciate it if you went out and supported whatever I put in stores. More news to come, but once again, no free music indefinitely. Hold your head, kids...|$|E

500|$|In October 1909, the Union balloted {{its members}} over the organisation's {{membership}} of the General Federation of Trade Unions (GTFU). The result of the vote, a decisive [...] "no" [...] to GFTU support, effectively supported the FA's position that professional footballers were fundamentally different from workmen in other industries. Meredith resumed league football in November 1909, bemoaning his view that [...] "many players refuse to <b>take</b> <b>things</b> seriously and continue to live a kind of schoolboy life".|$|E
500|$|According to biographer Barbara Victor in {{the book}} Goddess: Inside Madonna, Madonna wrote the song during her six-month vocal {{training}} with vocal coach Joan Leder in preparation of {{her role in the}} musical Evita. In a January 1996 [...] interview with Spin magazine, Madonna said that the song was inspired by a happy moment in her life, when she gave a chance to a man she knew, {{and he was able to}} fulfill it to her needs. She reversed the situation and wrote the song. Madonna explained, [...] "Often in my songwriting, I <b>take</b> <b>things</b> people say to me and turn them around, and put it in the first person. So it's actually something that was said to me." [...] Madonna did not reveal the name of the person who became the main subject of the song.|$|E
500|$|..... And when Michel {{gets his}} strokes of genius and, {{in the video}} for [...] "Army of Me", wants a dentist that's a gorilla to find a diamond in my mouth, some people call it nonsense. But it's {{probably}} the most realistic way of expressing what situation I'm in - all these people trying to <b>take</b> <b>things</b> away from me, and the gorilla finding a diamond that I don't know I have and then stealing it. [...] "Army of Me" [...] is so much about me actually learning that I have to defend myself. I {{have to stand up}} and fight the fucking gorilla. Once I've got the diamond and I run away with it, it becomes massive 'cos it's mine. But if the gorilla had kept it, it would have gone really tiny. That's surrealism for me.|$|E

Linden rushes in to help. Three weeks have passed since Maddy was stabbed. She is in Holby Care and we hear her thinking about a letter she has written to her sister Hannah. She seems to be fully recovered and is desperately trying to get back to work and be interviewed for the ST3 job. Ric held the interviews open until Maddy was well enough, and today she's going to make sure she gets the job. Maddy's going to show them that they can throw anything at her and she'll cope...even after being stabbed. Linden wants Maddy to be careful and <b>take</b> <b>things</b> easy, as she nearly died, but Maddy wants to get back to work.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} month, in November 1906, Hogan {{responded to}} rumors that Walter East, {{manager of the}} Akron Rubbernecks, had agreed to [...] "lay down" [...] to the Youngstown club, enabling them to win the pennant. [...] "Instead of laying down to us, Akron loaded up with catcher [...] Munson and pitcher Bob Spade", Hogan {{said in an interview}} with the Pittsburgh Press. [...] "They worked their heads off to down us, but could not do so". [...] Hogan went on to assert that the Akron club, and its manager, received generous incentives to defeat Youngstown. [...] "The Akron owner offered the players a bonus of $500 if they would beat us out in addition to a $300 wad for East", Hogan said. [...] Then, he accused East himself of attempting to [...] "fix" [...] a game during the 1906 season, claiming that the Akron manager had [...] "tried to get another club to <b>take</b> <b>things</b> easy against Akron so that Akron could beat us for the pennant".|$|E
500|$|In an interview, Coldplay vocalist Chris Martin {{revealed}} that the song was written in mid-2004 and was inspired by Martin's daughter, Apple, and English alternative rock singer Kate Bush: [...] "That's a song where we were listening {{to a lot of}} Kate Bush last summer, and we wanted a song which had a lot of tom-toms in it. I just had my daughter up also, and was kind of feeling in a sense of awe and wonderment, so the song is kind of a Kate Bush song about miracles." [...] The drumbeat of the song was inspired by Bush's 1985 song [...] "Running Up that Hill". In a separate interview, bassist Guy Berryman said: [...] "We were really trying to recreate the drums on that song for this song, and the chords. Some bands are reluctant to admit that they <b>take</b> <b>things</b> from other artists and bands that they listen to and we're shameless in that respect, we don't mind telling." ...|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Kevin (Brian Baumgartner) seeks {{advice from}} {{others in the}} office on how to start a {{relationship}} with Lynne (Lisa K. Wyatt), the woman he socialized with at the Valentine's Day singles mixer at the office (from the previous episode, [...] "Blood Drive"). Andy (Ed Helms), still upset from his recent broken engagement with Angela (Angela Kinsey), suggests that Kevin should be mean to Lynne, providing only backhanded compliments and ignoring her calls. Jim (John Krasinski) suggests he ask her out, but not immediately and <b>take</b> <b>things</b> slow. Pam (Jenna Fischer), on the other hand, suggests he ask her out immediately and not be afraid to express himself to her. When Lynne visits the office, Kevin said he has decided to simply tell her what exactly he is thinking. He tells her {{that she has a}} nice smile and he would like to take her out to dinner and a movie, which she accepts. Kevin then accidentally says [...] "Nice...boobs", but Lynne seems flattered by the statement.|$|E
500|$|Concerned for his health, Irving's {{brothers}} financed {{an extended}} tour of Europe from 1804 to 1806. Irving bypassed {{most of the}} sites and locations considered essential {{for the development of}} an upwardly mobile young man, to the dismay of his brother William. William wrote that, though he was pleased his brother's health was improving, he did not like the choice to [...] "gallop through Italy... leaving Florence on your left and Venice on your right". Instead, Irving honed the social and conversational skills that would later make him one of the world's most in-demand guests. [...] "I endeavor to <b>take</b> <b>things</b> as they come with cheerfulness", Irving wrote, [...] "and when I cannot get a dinner to suit my taste, I endeavor to get a taste to suit my dinner". While visiting Rome in 1805, Irving struck up a friendship with the American painter Washington Allston and nearly allowed himself to be persuaded into following Allston into a career as a painter. [...] "My lot in life, however", Irving said later, [...] "was differently cast".|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song {{describe}} a [...] "tortured romantic scenario" [...] of a newly formed couple's relationship, which, according to McCall, is enhanced by the piano and guitar arrangements. Kelley and Scott alternate on lead vocals. It speaks of the couple who prefer not to take their romantic relationship further anytime soon, want to <b>take</b> <b>things</b> slow, and are satisfied with [...] "just a goodnight kiss". McCall {{also noted that the}} lyrics portray how the female character's lines, sung by Scott, attempt to fight back her lustful feelings, and precariously sighs the line [...] "I don't want to mess this thing up." [...] Scott told Billboard that [...] "there is so much excitement {{at the beginning of a}} new relationship ... all the butterflies and that optimistic feeling that this person could be 'the one'. This song is about one of those times when your brain kicks in and tells your heart 'good things are worth waiting for.'" [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe wrote that the song's production is [...] "emblematic of the album's midtempo complacency." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix noted that the strings [...] "give a nice lift at the end." ...|$|E
