5|$|Both {{operations}} were {{hampered by the}} German need to rely on their Croatian allies as well as <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> forces were ill-equipped for operations in mountainous terrain during extreme winter conditions. The Croatian units had proven {{not to be a}} useful addition to the operation, as they possessed {{little in the way of}} fighting power, had little unit cohesion and suffered from serious supply problems.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} shared {{association}} with skiing and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> place names referring to Ullr and Skaði appear most frequently in Sweden, {{some scholars have}} proposed a particular {{connection between the two}} gods. On the other hand, Skaði may potentially be a masculine form and, as a result, some scholars have theorized that Skaði may have originally been a male deity.|$|E
5|$|Dundee United's {{traditional}} rivals are Dundee, {{with whom}} they compete in the Dundee derby. The fixture was lacking a competitive element {{for a number of}} years until Dundee's return to the top flight of the Scottish game. A unique element of the rivalry lies in <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> clubs' stadiums are located within 100 yards of one another.|$|E

5|$|Antón, as expected, {{was named}} as the squad {{leader for the}} Vuelta a España. His goal was overall success. He was joined in the squad by fellow Giro d'Italia stage winner Nieve, Martínez, Verdugo, Txurruka, Oroz, Isasi, Azanza and Cazaux. Nieve commented a day into the Vuelta that he would ride solely to support Antón, despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> had won Giro stages and he (Nieve) had {{actually}} finished the race higher overall.|$|E
5|$|Both {{individually}} {{and as a}} comedic duo, Pascal and Maximus have garnered universal acclaim from film critics, who referred to the characters as scene stealers – British magazine SFX dubbed Maximus the film's breakout star while The Age hailed the character as the funniest horse in film history – in addition to praising <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> characters are refreshingly funny, expressive and charismatic {{without the use of}} dialogue. Additionally, several film critics preferred Pascal and Maximus to the film's couple.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} greeted warmly by the {{majority}} of the boxing community, with many experts believing the Rocky character is still a key symbol of the sport and that the boxing scenes were the most realistic of any film. On the DVD, Stallone attributes this {{to the fact that he}} used realistic sound-effects (the previous installments had become notorious for their unrealistic and loud sounds of punches landing) and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> Stallone and Tarver threw real punches at each other.|$|E
5|$|The {{present form}} of the {{doctrine}} seems to be unchanged {{at least since the}} time of Bhadrabahu (c. 300 BCE) who is respected by both the sects. This is supported by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> Svetambara and Digambara sects agree on the basic doctrine, giving indication that it reached in its present form before the schism took place. Bhadrabahu is usually seen as the last leader of united Jain sangh. Detailed codification of types of karma and their effects were attested by Umasvati who is regarded by both Digambara and Svetambara as one of theirs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{calculation}} {{speed is}} one of most dofficult problems for a computer-generated hologram of an object. This is due to <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> pixel number of an object {{and that of the}} hologram are very large. In this paper we calculate the computer-generated hologram of an object by a difference method and translation symmetry. The main operation of the difference method is addition which is faster than multiplication and division. By translation symmetry of pixels of the object and holgram plane, we can void many repeating calculations. Thus oue method can speed up the computer-generated hologram of an objec. The computer simulation result proves that our method is effective...|$|R

5|$|An {{additional}} intensity to {{the rivalry}} is <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> Maribor and Olimpija always had support on their matches from ultras groups, called Viole Maribor (supporting Maribor), and the Green Dragons, who support Olimpija. The two groups {{are the largest}} in the country, and it is not uncommon that the matches between the two clubs were sometimes interrupted by violent clashes between the two groups or with the police. On many occasions, before or after the matches, the fans of the two clubs would also meet up and fight on the streets. One of the worst incidents, in April 2010 after a match, resulted in a stabbing of a member of the Green Dragons who, with a group of friends, got into a fight with members of the Viole in Ljubljana's railway station. However, to date, there have not been any fatalities in the country related to football violence.|$|E
5|$|Atomic {{exchange}} involves {{exchange between}} an adatom and an adjacent atom within the surface lattice. As {{shown in figure}} 4, after an atomic exchange event the adatom has taken {{the place of a}} surface atom and the surface atom has been displaced and has now become an adatom. This process may take place in both heterodiffusion (e.g. Pt adatoms on Ni) and self-diffusion (e.g. Pt adatoms on Pt). It is still unclear from a theoretical point of view why the atomic exchange mechanism is more predominant in some systems than in others. Current theory points towards multiple possibilities, including tensile surface stresses, surface relaxation about the adatom, and increased stability of the intermediate due to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> atoms involved maintain high levels of coordination throughout the process.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1968, Motown {{initiated}} {{a number of}} high-profile collaborations for the Supremes with their old colleagues, the Temptations. Besides <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> groups had come up together, the pairings made financial sense: the Supremes had a mostly white fanbase, while the Temptations a mostly black fanbase. By 1969, the label began plans for a Diana Ross solo career. A number of candidates—most notably Syreeta Wright—were considered to replace Ross. After seeing 24-year-old Jean Terrell perform with her brother Ernie in Florida, Berry Gordy decided on Ross' replacement. Terrell was signed to Motown and began recording the first post-Ross Supremes songs with Wilson and Birdsong during the day, while Wilson and Birdsong toured with Ross at night. At the same time, Ross began to make her first solo recordings. In November 1969, Ross' solo career was publicly announced.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} that the developers faced was in adding enough elements to Metroid: Zero Mission to make it feel new, while keeping the spirit of the original Metroid. Because both games were made for the Game Boy Advance, Metroid: Zero Mission uses a rebuilt version of the game engine used for Metroid Fusion so that it {{did not need to be}} built from scratch. This marked the first time two Metroid installments have been released for the same video game console. Metroid Fusion had offered connectivity with Metroid Prime on the Nintendo GameCube, but Metroid: Zero Mission did not offer such a feature. Sakamoto explained that the developers wanted to make the game connect to Metroid Prime 2: Echoes on the GameCube, but <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> their release dates were far apart and not enough development time to implement connectivity features prevented them from doing so. However, they managed to include the ability for Metroid Fusion to connect with Metroid: Zero Mission.|$|E
5|$|Pospisil {{is more of}} a {{contemporary}} rather than a rival of Raonic. Owing to their similarity in age—Pospisil is six months older—and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> are successful products of Tennis Canada's development programs, they have been linked as the leaders {{of a new generation of}} Canadian tennis players. They partnered in doubles frequently early in their careers, winning doubles titles together in junior and ATP Challenger events. Between 2011 and 2015, Raonic and Pospisil have been the two top-ranked Canadian men in year-end rankings. As well as four ATP Challenger and Futures matches, they have played each other in two ATP World Tour matches: Raonic beat Pospisil in the first all-Canadian semifinal at an ATP 1000 tournament, and in the first all-Canadian final in ATP history. They are frequent Davis Cup teammates, and they planned to play doubles together at the 2016 Rio Olympics until Raonic withdrew.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt {{had been}} {{surprised}} by {{the outcome of the}} Republican convention, having expected to oppose a conservative isolationist. The polls showed Willkie behind by only six points, and the president expected this to be a more difficult race than he had faced in his defeats of Hoover and Landon. Roosevelt felt that Willkie's nomination would remove the war issue from the campaign. Roosevelt was nominated by the Democratic convention in Chicago in July, though he stated that because of the world crisis, he would not actively campaign, leaving that to surrogates. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> major-party presidential candidates favored intervention frustrated isolationists, who considered wooing Charles Lindbergh as a third party candidate.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after his}} seizure of power, Gelimer's {{domestic}} position began to deteriorate, as he persecuted his political enemies among the Vandal nobility, confiscating their property and executing many of them. These actions undermined his already doubtful legitimacy {{in the eyes}} of many, and contributed to the outbreak of two revolts in remote provinces of the Vandal kingdom: in Sardinia, where the local governor, Godas, declared himself an independent ruler, and shortly after in Tripolitania, where the native population, led by a certain Pudentius, rebelled against Vandal rule. Although Procopius' narrative makes both uprisings seem coincidental, Ian Hughes points out <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> rebellions broke out shortly before the commencement of the Roman expedition against the Vandals, and that both Godas and Pudentius immediately asked for assistance from Justinian, as evidence of an active diplomatic involvement by the Emperor in their preparation.|$|E
5|$|The {{probable}} {{properties of}} further alkali metals beyond unhexpentium {{have not been}} explored yet as of 2015; in fact, it is suspected {{that they may not}} be able to exist. In periods 8 and above of the periodic table, relativistic and shell-structure effects become so strong that extrapolations from lighter congeners become completely inaccurate. In addition, the relativistic and shell-structure effects (which stabilise the s-orbitals and destabilise and expand the d-, f-, and g-orbitals of higher shells) have opposite effects, causing even larger difference between relativistic and non-relativistic calculations of the properties of elements with such high atomic numbers. Interest in the chemical properties of ununennium and unhexpentium stems from <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> elements are located close to the expected locations of islands of stabilities, centered at elements 122 (306Ubb) and 164 (482Uhq).|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech was {{selected}} as {{a participant in the}} 2006 Gator Bowl following a 10–2 regular season that included wins over 15th-ranked Georgia Tech and traditional rivals Virginia and West Virginia. A loss to Florida State in the inaugural ACC Championship Game gave Tech a position in the Gator Bowl instead of the more prestigious Bowl Championship Series-run Orange Bowl game. Facing the 12th-ranked Hokies were the 15th-ranked Louisville Cardinals, who finished 9–2 during the regular season of their first year in the Big East Conference. Louisville won its last five games before the Gator Bowl and participated in the Liberty Bowl {{at the end of the}} previous season. Pre-game media coverage of the game focused on Virginia Tech's fall from being a contender for the national championship, Louisville's loss of star quarterback Brian Brohm to injury, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> teams were playing under new conference affiliations, and the rise of Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick, younger brother of NFL star Michael Vick.|$|E
