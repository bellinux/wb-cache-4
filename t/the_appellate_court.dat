5|$|The Court's {{caseload}} {{continued to}} grow over time.

5|$|In 1970 state {{constitutional}} amendments reorganized the Court. The constitution renamed <b>the</b> <b>Appellate</b> <b>Court</b> the Indiana Court of Appeals. With {{the formation of}} the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court could choose which cases it would hear and which cases it would leave to the lower courts. Constitutional amendments also lengthened judicial terms to ten years and changed the limits {{on the size of the}} Court to a minimum of five members and a maximum of nine. The method of selecting justices was changed from statewide election to appointment by the governor. The amendment also provided for a Judicial Nominating Commission to choose candidates. Justices also became subject to a retention election. In addition, the office of chief justice became permanent. Previously the title rotated among the justices. In 2004 the Indiana General Assembly created the Supreme Court Division of Administration, legalizing and expanding the role of the clerks of the Court.|$|E
5|$|Slade's Case (or Slade v. Morley) {{was a case}} in English {{contract}} law that ran from 1596 to 1602. Under the medieval common law, claims seeking the repayment of a debt or other matters could only be pursued through a writ of debt in the Court of Common Pleas, a problematic and archaic process. By 1558 the lawyers had succeeded in creating another method, enforced by the Court of King's Bench, through the action of assumpsit, which was technically for deceit. The legal fiction used was that by failing to pay after promising to do so, a defendant had committed deceit, and was liable to the plaintiff. The conservative Common Pleas, through <b>the</b> <b>appellate</b> <b>court</b> the Court of Exchequer Chamber, began to overrule decisions made by the King's Bench on assumpsit, causing friction between the courts.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 and 2005, two state-level {{class action}} suits were filed against Apple in New York and California alleging the first, second, and third {{generation}} iPod music players sold prior to May 2004 {{did not have}} the battery life represented and/or that the battery's capacity to take and hold a charge substantially diminished over time. Rather than litigate these claims, Apple entered into a settlement agreement in August 2005 after a fairness hearing in the California action, with the settlement terms designed to end the New York action as well. An appeal followed the California court's approval of the settlement but <b>the</b> <b>appellate</b> <b>court</b> upheld the settlement in December 2005. Eligible members of the class were entitled to extended warranties, store credit, cash compensation, or battery replacement, and some incentive payments, with all unfiled claims expiring after September 2005. Apple agreed to pay all costs of the litigation, including incentive payments to the class members and the plaintiffs' attorney fees, but admitted no fault. In 2006 Apple Canada, Inc., also settled several similar Canadian class action suits alleging misrepresentations by Apple regarding iPod battery life.|$|E

40|$|This Article first {{examines}} the problem currently facing <b>the</b> <b>appellate</b> <b>courts</b> {{as to whether}} a party may initially raise ERISA preemption after trial or on appeal.

The Article then explores the failure of <b>the</b> <b>appellate</b> <b>courts</b> to follow <b>the</b> ERISA mandate. Finally, the Article outlines <b>the</b> analysis <b>appellate</b> <b>courts</b> should conduct relating the legislative intent to the procedural effect of ERISA preemption in answering {{the question of whether}} a party can waive the preemption. This Article asserts that ERISA preemption is jurisdictional and, therefore, may be raised {{for the first time on}} appeal. This approach gives ERISA preemption the same procedural effect as NLRA preemption and preserves a uniform federal common law with respect to employee benefit plans, thereby encouraging the growth of private employee benefit plans...|$|R

5|$|The tribe then {{appealed the}} case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. <b>The</b> <b>appellate</b> <b>court</b> found that various federal laws {{required}} the DOI and BIA to maintain historic buildings and to maintain Indian trust properties, but that they did not authorize monetary damages. The court then looked to the 1960 act and determined that this act did create a trust relationship that could be enforced with monetary damages. This was based on common law, with the court referencing the Restatement (Second) of Trusts to outline that a trust requires a trustee (the United States), a beneficiary (the tribe), and a trust body (the land and buildings). The court noted that both parties agreed that there was a trust, but not that damages were authorized. The court held that where the United States had control over the use and maintenance of the buildings to the exclusion of the tribe, a fiduciary duty was created that authorized the tribe to seek monetary damages. The court then reversed and remanded the decision of the trial court. The United States appealed, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.|$|E
5|$|The {{troubles}} {{during this}} period are best illustrated by Slade's Case. Under the medieval common law, claims seeking the repayment of a debt or other matters could only be pursued through a writ of debt in the Common Pleas, a problematic and archaic process. By 1558 the lawyers had succeeded in creating another method, enforced by the Court of King's Bench, through the action of assumpsit, which was technically for deceit. The legal fiction used was that by failing to pay after promising to do so, a defendant had committed deceit, and was liable to the plaintiff. The conservative Common Pleas, through <b>the</b> <b>appellate</b> <b>court</b> the Court of Exchequer Chamber, began to overrule decisions made by the King's Bench on assumpsit, causing friction between the courts. In Slade's Case, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench, John Popham, deliberately provoked the Common Pleas into bringing an assumpsit action to a higher court where the Justices of the King's Bench could vote, allowing them to overrule the Common Pleas and establish assumpsit as the main contractual action. After the death of Edmund Anderson, the more activist Francis Gawdy became Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, which briefly led to a less reactionary and more revolutionary Common Pleas.|$|E
5|$|As {{a longer}} term and more {{significant}} development, the Bill of Middlesex {{was one of}} several revolutionary developments by the King's Bench met with a conservative reaction from the Common Pleas, fearful of losing its own caseload.

25|$|If a {{defendant}} is {{sentenced to death}} at the trial level, the case then goes into a direct review. The direct review process is a typical legal appeal. An appellate court examines the record of evidence presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether the decision was legally sound or not. Direct review of a capital sentencing hearing will result {{in one of three}} outcomes. If <b>the</b> <b>appellate</b> <b>court</b> finds that no significant legal errors occurred in the capital sentencing hearing, <b>the</b> <b>appellate</b> <b>court</b> will affirm the judgment, or let the sentence stand. If <b>the</b> <b>appellate</b> <b>court</b> finds that significant legal errors did occur, then it will reverse the judgment, or nullify the sentence and order a new capital sentencing hearing. Lastly, if <b>the</b> <b>appellate</b> <b>court</b> finds that no reasonable juror could find the defendant eligible for the death penalty, a rarity, then it will order the defendant acquitted, or not guilty, of the crime for which he/she was given the death penalty, and order him sentenced to the next most severe punishment for which the offense is eligible. About 60 percent survive the process of direct review intact.|$|E
