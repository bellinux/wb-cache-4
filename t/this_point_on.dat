5|$|From <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on,</b> {{the term}} 'dreadnought' became less widely used. Most pre-dreadnought battleships were {{scrapped}} or hulked after World War I, so the term 'dreadnought' became less necessary.|$|E

5|$|Imaginos/Desdinova becomes from <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> an {{instrument}} of Les Invisibles' manipulation of human history.

5|$|This was {{not enough}} to cause a {{complete}} fallout between the two men, though from <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> Warwick increasingly stayed away from court. The promotion of Warwick's brother George to Archbishop of York shows that the earl was still in favour with the king. In July 1465, when Henry VI was once more captured, it was Warwick who escorted the fallen king to his captivity in the Tower.|$|E

M-28 has not shared its routing with any other state trunklines.|$|E
5|$|After Edward I's death, Arundel {{became part}} of the {{opposition}} to the new king Edward II, and his favourite Piers Gaveston. In 1311 {{he was one of the}} so-called Lords Ordainers who assumed control of government from the king. Together with Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, he was responsible for the death of Gaveston in 1312. From <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on,</b> however, his relationship to the king became more friendly. This was to a large extent due to his association with the king's new favourite Hugh Despenser the Younger, whose daughter was married to Arundel's son. Arundel supported the king in suppressing rebellions by Roger Mortimer and other Marcher Lords, and eventually also Thomas of Lancaster. For this he was awarded with land and offices.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} July 5 Battle of Osan, US troops began a {{continuous}} and unsuccessful ground {{campaign against the}} North Koreans, {{and many of the}} US air assets were used in close air support and airstrike roles to aid the faltering ground troops. From <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> bombers mounted strategic bombing missions against military targets of all types supporting the North Korean ground troops, including ports, armor concentrations and supply stockpiles. A massive interdiction campaign ensued which would have implications for the upcoming conflicts. As more US Air Force, US Navy and US Marine Corps aviation assets arrived in the country, they increased their interdiction campaigns for several days striking bridges and strategic areas though going mostly unthreatened by the North Korean Air Force, though at least one F-80 was lost when it hit power lines during a bombing run.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} new king was {{initially}} met with goodwill from his subjects, {{it was not}} long before certain members of the nobility became disaffected with Gaveston and the special relationship he enjoyed with Edward. On 2 December 1307, exactly one month after Gaveston's marriage, the King organised a tournament in Gaveston's honour at Wallingford Castle. Here Gaveston and his companions in arms handed a humiliating defeat to the earls of Warenne, Hereford, and Arundel. Gaveston won, according to various accounts of the events, either by bringing too many knights to the field, or simply by having a better contingent. From <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> Warenne – and possibly also the other two earls – became hostile to Gaveston.|$|E
5|$|His {{first study}} of {{mathematics}} began with papers by George Pólya {{and by the}} crystallographer Friedrich Haag on plane symmetry groups, sent {{to him by his}} brother Berend, a geologist. He carefully studied the 17 wallpaper groups, and created periodic tilings with 43 drawings of different types of symmetry. From <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> he developed a mathematical approach to expressions of symmetry in his art works using his own notation. Starting in 1937, he created woodcuts based on the 17 groups. His Metamorphosis I (1937) began a series of designs that told a story through the use of pictures. In Metamorphosis I, he transformed convex polygons into regular patterns in a plane to form a human motif. He extended the approach in his piece Metamorphosis III, which is four metres long.|$|E

5|$|Kruger's final {{administration}} was, Meintjes suggests, {{the strongest}} {{in the history}} of the republic. He had the former Free State President FW Reitz as State Secretary from June 1898 and Leyds, who set up an office in Brussels, as Envoy Extraordinary in Europe. The post of State Attorney was given to a young lawyer from the Cape called Jan Smuts, for whom Kruger presaged great things. The removal of Leyds to Europe marked the end of Kruger's longstanding policy of giving important government posts to Dutchmen; convinced of Cape Afrikaners' sympathy following the Jameson Raid, he preferred them from <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on.</b>|$|E
5|$|North of Wemple, the {{sporadic}} residences {{along the}} highway are replaced by a string of tank farms serving barges on the Hudson River. The industrial surroundings follow NY144 into the hamlet of Glenmont, centered on the route's junction with Glenmont Road. Here, NY144 crosses over another set of railroad tracks before heading northeastward from the community toward Normans Kill. The route runs alongside the Hudson River tributary and another set of tank farms to an intersection with NY32 (Corning Hill Road) near the Port of Albany–Rensselaer, where the NY144 designation terminates. NY32 continues northward from <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> NY144's right-of-way, becoming South Pearl Street and immediately crossing Normans Kill to enter the city of Albany.|$|E
5|$|Route22 {{continues}} heading northeast along {{a narrow}} strip of land between the East Branch and Bog Brook reservoirs. It then resumes its northward heading, following a much straighter course than it had up to <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>on</b> two lanes through wooded areas {{of the town of}} Patterson, where two local state highways, NY312 and 164, come in from the west. The highway gradually expands to three and sometimes four lanes as it passes through built-up areas of strip development. Shortly after intersecting a third state highway, NY311, and passing another strip plaza, NY22 crosses into Dutchess County.|$|E

5|$|The Partisans then {{committed}} the 16th Vojvodina Division {{to assist the}} 36th Vojvodina Division that had borne the brunt of Operation Heiderose to <b>this</b> <b>point.</b> <b>On</b> 20 July, both divisions attacked the 27th Regiment, which counterattacked the following day after the Partisans were rebuffed with heavy casualties. On 23 July, the Partisans began to withdraw south out of the area. The division began {{to search for the}} hidden Partisan bases that German intelligence had indicated were located there. After a day of searching, the division uncovered more than ten Partisan bases, which the cooperating Chetniks began to clear despite having shown little interest in actually fighting the Partisans in previous days.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} work to {{represent}} this new orthography was Elihu Doty's Anglo-Chinese Manual with Romanized Colloquial in the Amoy Dialect, published in 1853. The manual {{can therefore be}} regarded as the first presentation of a pre-modern POJ, a significant step onwards from Medhurst's orthography and different from today's system in only a few details. From <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> various authors adjusted some of the consonants and vowels, but the system of tone marks from Doty's Manual survives intact in modern POJ. John Van Nest Talmage has traditionally been regarded as the founder of POJ among the community which uses the orthography, although it now seems that he was an early promoter of the system, rather than its inventor.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Lithuania between 1219 and 1295 {{concerns}} {{the establishment and}} early history of the first Lithuanian state, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The beginning of the 13th century {{marks the end of}} the prehistory of Lithuania. From <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> the history of Lithuania is recorded in chronicles, treaties, and other written documents. In 1219, 21 Lithuanian dukes signed a peace treaty with Galicia–Volhynia. This event is widely accepted as the first proof that the Baltic tribes were uniting and consolidating. Despite continuous warfare with two Christian orders, the Livonian Order and the Teutonic Knights, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was established and gained some control over the lands of Black Ruthenia, Polatsk, Minsk, and other territories east of modern-day Lithuania that had become weak and vulnerable after the collapse of Kievan Rus'.|$|E
