Most <b>third</b> <b>elements</b> used in the studies, such as C, Si, Co, and Cr, decreased the start temperature of γ → ε martensitic transformation (Ms), the start temperature of its reverse transformation (As), the amount of ε martensite at room temperature, and the damping capacity, although they increased the hardness and strength.

50|$|The novel {{tells of}} the {{events leading up to}} the Warriors' return to Mars and retells the story of The <b>Third</b> <b>Element</b> strip. It {{introduces}} the troubled marriage of Senator Diaz and Juanita Perez, and we see the latter's relationship with Joe Pineapples develop. We are also witness to the disagreements between President Cobb and Senator Diaz, which lead to civil war. These elements are picked up in the following comic strip, The Shadow Warriors. It should be noted that by placing Roadkill after The <b>Third</b> <b>Element,</b> the novel contradicts the strip. In the comic, Morrigun appears in Roadkill and is killed in The <b>Third</b> <b>Element.</b> In the novel, she dies and then the events of Roadkill are said to have happened (without Morrigun's appearance).|$|R
