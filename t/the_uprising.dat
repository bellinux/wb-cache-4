5|$|Eventually, <b>the</b> <b>uprising</b> {{was doomed}} by poor {{communication}} and the overeagerness {{of some of}} the PMO activists. Piłsudski failed to discourage local PMO activists from carrying out the Sejny Uprising in the Suwałki Region. The local PMO disregarded his recommendations and launched <b>the</b> <b>uprising,</b> which while locally successful, led to the failure of the nationwide coup. PMO members in Lithuania stated that the Sejny uprising had damaged their reputation, and many of its former supporters rejected calls by PMO recruiters.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, {{following}} {{the collapse of}} the First United Front, Kuomintang authorities ordered Zhu to lead a force against Zhou Enlai and Liu Bocheng's Nanchang Uprising. Having helped orchestrate <b>the</b> <b>uprising,</b> Zhu and his army defected from the Kuomintang. <b>The</b> <b>uprising</b> failed to gather support, however, and Zhu was forced to flee Nanchang with his army. Under the false name of Wang Kai, Zhu managed to find shelter for his remaining forces by joining warlord Fan Shisheng. He was soon named head of a new First United Front military institute in Nanchang.|$|E

Only 26 years later, in 1525, the German Peasants' War reached Aach, when region's aristocrats flew from <b>the</b> <b>uprisings</b> to <b>the</b> city, whereupon it was {{occupied}} by the rebel peasants.

5|$|The major revolt {{began on}} September 20, 1260. It was {{triggered}} by the Lithuanian and Samogitian military victory against the joint forces of the Livonian Order and Teutonic Knights in the Battle of Durbe. As <b>the</b> <b>uprising</b> was spreading through Prussian lands, each clan chose a leader: the Sambians were led by Glande, the Natangians by Herkus Monte, the Bartians by Diwanus, the Warmians by Glappe, the Pogesanians by Auktume. One clan that did not join <b>the</b> <b>uprising</b> was the Pomesanians. <b>The</b> <b>uprising</b> was also supported by Skalmantas, leader of the Sudovians. However, {{there was no one}} leader to coordinate efforts of these different forces. Herkus Monte, who was educated in Germany, became the best known and most successful of the leaders, but he commanded only his Natangians.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>uprising</b> {{contributed to}} the {{deterioration}} of the Polish–Lithuanian relations and further discouraged the Lithuanians from joining Piłsudski's proposed Międzymorze federation. The Sejny Uprising doomed the Polish plan to overthrow the Lithuanian government in a coup d'état. After <b>the</b> <b>uprising,</b> the Lithuanian police and intelligence intensified their investigation of Polish sympathizers and soon uncovered the planned coup. They made mass arrests of Polish activists from August 27 to the end of September 1919. During the investigations, lists of PMO supporters were found; law enforcement completely suppressed the organisation in Lithuania, arresting members.|$|E

5|$|A {{division}} {{developed between}} the uprising's communist {{leadership and the}} nationalists participating. The nationalists recognised <b>the</b> <b>uprising</b> had been crushed and wanted to stop fighting, while the Partisans were determined to continue the struggle. In late 1941, the nationalists contacted the Italians and offered to help them fight the communists, who had since been renamed Partisans. The nationalistsincluding Đurišić, who was popular in his own Vasojević clan of northern Montenegrosubsequently withdrew into the hinterland. They sought to avoid provoking the Italians and protect the mountain villages if they were attacked. In northern Montenegro, there was a marked distinction between the communists and nationalists. The nationalists had closer ties with Serbia and possessed a frontier mentality towards Muslims. The communists wished to continue <b>the</b> <b>uprising</b> by turning against their class enemies. Ustaše manipulation of the Muslims in the Sandžak and the expulsion of Serbs from areas annexed by Albania made Đurišić and his Chetniks impatient to continue fighting the Italians. They subsequently turned on the Muslims and Albanians in the region. <b>The</b> <b>uprising</b> continued with reduced intensity until December 1941. In 1941, Đurišić was awarded the Order of Karađorđe's Star by the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{on the recommendation of}} Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović.|$|E

He returned in 2009 when he co-founded Al Wafa' opposition group and became its official spokesperson. He played a bigger role in the uprising; he was not arrested when <b>the</b> <b>uprising</b> began nor was he outside the country. Hussain led the first demonstration in <b>the</b> <b>uprising</b> {{in the early hours of}} 14 February. He is also credited with suggesting autonomous action and total decentralization of the protest movement which was adopted by February 14 Youth Coalition, the group behind the call for an uprising in order to avoid getting infiltrated by government.|$|E

5|$|From July to October 1948 in Antananarivo, the French {{organized}} a large public trial of <b>the</b> <b>uprising,</b> charging 77 {{officials of the}} MDRM. The French authorities claimed that MDRM appeals for calm immediately prior to the outbreak of violence had been a diversion tactic to mask their involvement in organizing the rebellion, which the French alleged was secretly launched by way of an encoded MDRM telegram. Deputies Ravoahangy and Rabemananjara were arrested and imprisoned on 12 April 1947, followed two months later by Raseta (who was in Paris when <b>the</b> <b>Uprising</b> began), in violation {{of their right to}} diplomatic immunity.
