Second, the decision on the <b>tax</b> <b>rule</b> and the corporate tax rate is endogenized as outcome in a non-cooperative game. All tax rules lead to the same inefficient outcome.

40|$|First Draft – Please do not quote This paper {{investigates the}} effects of fiscal policy rules in {{providing}} macroeconomic stabilization under imperfect unemployment insurance. We use a micro-founded New Keynesian model which incorporates persistence in inflation, non-Ricardian consumers {{as well as a}} frictional labor market. We find in line with recent literature that in presence of a frictional labor market, tax smoothing may not necessarily be the optimal choice but that taxes should rather tackle inefficiencies on the labor market. Still, a countercyclical stance for a <b>tax</b> <b>rule</b> seems preferable. Under a progressive tax system, the role of smoothing is weaker than under proportional taxation. The focus on the level of debt is relatively small in both rules. Our welfare matrix, calculated as an average consumer loss function for the aggregated shocks, suggests that progressive taxation under the optimal <b>tax</b> <b>rule</b> is welfare-better...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} ability of a region {{participating}} in a currency union to affect its inflation differential with respect to the union through fiscal policy. We study the interaction between regional fiscal policy and inflation differentials in a flexible-price, two-region model with both traded and nontraded goods. For symmetric regions, changes in one region’s <b>tax</b> <b>rule</b> that decrease the volatility of its inflation differential also decrease the volatility of its output. The decrease in the volatility of the inflation differential is brought about by an increase in the volatility of tax rates. The effect of the <b>tax</b> <b>rule</b> on output volatility – but not inflation volatility – depends on country size. For a small country lower volatility of inflation differentials is associated with higher volatility of output. This relationship results from the fact that small countries are more open, and hence there is a greater role for traded goods productivity shocks. Fiscal policy; Inflation (Finance) ...|$|E

The EOp- and EO-criteria provide alternative methods for summarizing the efficiency-equality trade-off in the distribution of individual welfare. We also compare the results depending on whether we use income or money-metric utility as a measure of individual welfare. We estimate micro-econometric models of household labour supply and corresponding individual welfare measures based on 1995 Norwegian data for both married couples and singles. We then use these models to simulate behavioural responses and welfare gains and losses of various constant-revenue four-parameter <b>tax</b> <b>rules,</b> i. e. the <b>tax</b> <b>rules</b> defined by a lump-sum transfer (positive or negative), two marginal tax rates and a “kink point” that produces the same revenue collected with the observed 1995 rules.

This thesis aims {{to figure}} out an optimal {{combination}} of monetary policy tools and macroprudential tools {{in order to maintain}} both financial stability and price stability. In particular, given that monetary policy authority already considers loan growth in its objective function, it asks whether an additional macroprudential tool, a loan tax, is welfare-improving. For this purpose, it constructs a simple New Keynesian Model with capital and banking sector. By incorporating loan growth in a loss function, monetary policy authority chooses the optimum weights and derives a Taylor-type interest rate rule, which could be also called as leaning against the credit winds. Then, it adds an endogenous <b>tax</b> <b>rule</b> and compares the minimum mean values of loss function. The result of simulations suggest that a <b>tax</b> <b>rule</b> that responses to deviations from steady state value of growth, inflation and loan growth leads lower loss values, thus, the inclusion of tax in the policy rule set is welfareimprovingÇelik, ŞivaM.
