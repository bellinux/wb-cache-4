5|$|For random initial conditions, the {{boundaries}} between <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> formed in this way themselves shift in a seemingly random pattern, and trees frequently die out altogether. But {{by means of the}} theory of shift registers he and others were able to find initial conditions in which <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> all remain alive forever, the pattern of growth repeats periodically, and all of the clearings can be guaranteed to remain bounded in size.|$|E
5|$|In May 2000, twenty {{trees were}} planted, {{one for each}} boys who attended. During the {{planting}} ceremony, the Scout Chief Commissioner for England, along {{with representatives of the}} Scouts and the Guides, planted <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> on the seaward side of the original site. <b>The</b> <b>trees</b> were designed to act as a permanent memorial to the camp, as well as providing a series of future windbreaks against coastal winds.|$|E

50|$|Before {{climbing}} <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> both parts need to {{be adjusted}} to <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> so that both upper and lower parts are angled up {{to account for the}} narrowing of <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> To climb <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>the</b> back of each part is angled to <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> one at a time and pulled up. Then the part that the hunter is moving is set back level and the next part is moved up. This is done until the hunter is at the desired height. In addition to <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> stand, some hunters use a safety harness to prevent injury in the event that any component of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> stand fails. You should always be connected to <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> for safety. To descend <b>the</b> <b>tree,</b> <b>the</b> hunter simply reverses the order of operations to climb <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> - lowering <b>the</b> standing platform, standing on the standing platform, then lowering the sitting platform.|$|R
50|$|A pit, {{as defined}} above, is formed when {{pressure}} {{is applied to}} the trunk and crown of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> that is more powerful than the root and associated soil's ability to hold <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> upright and in place and knocks <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> down. This toppling of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> can be caused by a multitude of different types of forest disturbance. Wind may blow <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> down; snow may accumulate and put excessive weight on <b>the</b> tree; <b>the</b> <b>tree's</b> roots may have decayed to a point where they are not strong enough to hold <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> upright. Soil conditions also {{play a role in the}} ability of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> to remain upright. Wet soil can loosen <b>the</b> hold a <b>tree's</b> roots have on the soil, and dry soil can help hold <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> in place.|$|R
5000|$|Situations {{where the}} top of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> being {{measured}} is above eye level and the base of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> being measured is below eye level {{is the most common}} situation encountered in the field. The other two cases are those where both {{the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> and <b>the</b> base of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> are above eye level, and where both the top of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> and base of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> are located below eye level. In the first situation, if D1 is the distance to the top of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> as measured with a laser rangefinder, and (a) is the angle to the top of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> measured with a clinometer, then this forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle with the base of the triangle at eye level. The height of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> above eye level is = sin(a) x D1. The same process is used to measure the height or extension of the base of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> above or below eye level where D1 is the distance to the base of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> and (b) is the angle to the base of <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> vertical distance to the base of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> above or below eye level is = sin(b) x D2. Common sense should prevail when adding h1 and h2. If the base of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> is below eye level the distance it extends below eye level is added to the height of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> above eye level to calculate the total height of <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> If <b>the</b> base of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> is above level then this height is subtracted from the height to the top of <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> Mathematically since <b>the</b> sine of a negative angle is negative, we always get the following formula: ...|$|R
5|$|With the {{darkness}} and fog, Mexican soldiers could not estimate how many men had surrounded them. They withdrew 300 yards (meters) to a nearby bluff.

5000|$|Identifying <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> as {{movement}}. <b>The</b> movement {{includes the}} flow of the juices through the veins of <b>the</b> <b>tree,</b> <b>the</b> breathing of the leaves, the roots sucking the water, the never-ending activities between <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> and earth and air, and the growth of <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} method {{used to prevent}} sun {{scalding}} on <b>the</b> trunks of <b>trees</b> is to wrap <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> up to <b>the</b> first branch with white paper overlapping approximately thirty three percent each time around <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> <b>The</b> white paper is effective in reflecting {{the heat of the}} sun off <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> <b>The</b> paper should be applied after <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> has gone dormant for the winter and taken off before it becomes active again.

5|$|Although the {{ecoregion}} remains ecologically intact, {{it faces}} conservation challenges {{that include the}} negative affects of certain forestry management and logging practices, higher risks of forest fires due to the alteration of <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> {{that make up the}} forest composition, and habitat fragmentation as a result of urban sprawl and development, which endangers the long-term survival of vulnerable species such as mountain caribou and the Northern goshawk.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} serious disease {{problems}} are fireblight, a bacterial disease; and Gymnosporangium rust, and black spot, two fungal diseases. Codling moths and apple maggots are two other pests which affect apple trees. Young apple trees are also prone to mammal pests like mice and deer, which feed on the soft bark of <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> especially in winter.|$|E
5|$|At higher {{elevations}} above the lake (especially in rocky or exposed locations), the pine and fir tree forests are thinner, and <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> grow {{in a more}} stunted fashion; instead, shrubs and bushes, such as green manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula), dwarf mountain manzanita (Arctostaphylos neuadensis), and tan oak (Lithocarpus densiflorus) find areas and niches to grow.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tree</b> {{height is}} <b>the</b> {{vertical}} {{distance between the}} base of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> and <b>the</b> tip of the highest branch on <b>the</b> <b>tree,</b> and is difficult to measure accurately. It {{is not the same}} as the length of the trunk. If a <b>tree</b> is leaning, <b>the</b> trunk length may be greater than the height of <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> <b>The</b> base of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> is where <b>the</b> projection of the pith (center) of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> intersects <b>the</b> existing supporting surface upon which <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> is growing or where the acorn sprouted. If <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> is growing on the side of a cliff, the base of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> is at <b>the</b> point where the pith would intersect the cliff side. Roots extending down from that point would not add to the height of <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> On a slope this base point is considered as halfway between the ground level at the upper and lower sides of <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> Tree height can be measured in a number of ways with varying degrees of accuracy.|$|R

5|$|In north-west Nelson, {{there are}} three {{ecotypes}} defined by soil and exposure. Trees growing on limestone bluffs have stiff, blue-green leaves.

Along the coast to the far west, <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> are robust with broad, bluish leaves.
