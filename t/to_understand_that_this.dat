5|$|Part of the {{conflict}} between Team Bondi and Rockstar was due to Rockstar's frustration with Team Bondi's direction, and eventually Team Bondi's management in turn resented Rockstar for taking lots of creative control. It's also worth pointing out that Rockstar used to be very keen on making Team Bondi something like 'Rockstar Sydney' - the more they worked with Team Bondi management, the more they came <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was a terrible idea.|$|E
25|$|In Christian Europe, {{people were}} persecuted for heresy, {{especially}} {{in countries where}} the Inquisition was active. Thomas Aquinas' five proofs of God's existence and Anselm's ontological argument implicitly acknowledged {{the validity of the}} question about God's existence. Frederick Copleston, however, explains that Thomas laid out his proofs not to counter atheism, but to address certain early Christian writers such as John of Damascus, who asserted that knowledge of God's existence was naturally innate in man, based on his natural desire for happiness. Thomas stated that although there is desire for happiness which forms the basis for a proof of God's existence in man, further reflection is required <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> desire is only fulfilled in God, not for example in wealth or sensual pleasure.|$|E

[...] The album peaked at #51 on the Billboard 200. Twiztid released their first compilation album and third overall album, Cryptic Collectionon November 13, 2000.|$|E

2500|$|During the South Carolina Democratic Debate in Myrtle Beach, Edwards {{sought to}} {{distinguish}} himself from Senators Obama and Clinton, and criticized {{them for their}} attacks and [...] "big city" [...] politics. As soon {{as he began to}} question how the attacks helped, he was widely cheered by the audience for in what many people thought was what distinguished Edwards from negative campaigning. Saying [...] "This kind of squabbling, how many children are going to get healthcare? How many {{people are going to get}} an education from this? How many kids are going to be able to go to college because of this? We have got to understand and I respect both of my fellow candidates, but we have got <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is not about us personally, it is about what we are trying to do for this country and what we believe in", Edwards began to get applause from several members of the audience.|$|E
2500|$|Ethan {{returns to}} the farm and picks up Mattie {{to take her to}} the train station. They stop at a hill upon which they had once planned to go sledding and decide to sled {{together}} as a way of delaying their sad parting. After their first run, Mattie suggests a suicide pact: that they go down again, and steer the sled directly into a tree, so they will never be parted and so that they may spend their last moments together. At first, Ethan refuses the plan, but, in his despair, he ultimately agrees. On the way down the hill, a vision of Zeena's face startles Ethan into swerving a bit, but he corrects their course, and they crash into the elm tree. Ethan regains consciousness after the accident, but Mattie lies beside him [...] "cheeping" [...] in pain like a small wounded animal. Ethan is also injured, and the reader is left <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was the [...] "smash-up" [...] that left Ethan with a permanent limp.|$|E

2500|$|In {{certain parts}} of Latin America, the usage of negro to {{directly}} address black people can be colloquial. It is important <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is not similar {{to the use of}} the word nigga in English in urban hip hop subculture in the United States, given that [...] "negro" [...] is not a racist term. For example, one might say to a friend, [...] " [...] (literally 'Hey, black-one, how are you doing?'). In such a case, the diminutive [...] can also be used, as a term of endearment meaning 'pal'/'buddy'/'friend'. [...] has thus also come to be used to refer to a person of any ethnicity or color, and also can have a sentimental or romantic connotation similar to 'sweetheart' or 'dear' in English. (However, in the Philippines negrito was used for a local dark-skinned, short population native to Luzon and the Visayas islands among other places; this is the meaning of Negrito in English.) In other Spanish-speaking South American countries, the word [...] can also be employed in a roughly equivalent term-of-endearment form, though it is not usually considered to be as widespread as in Argentina or Uruguay (except perhaps in a limited regional and/or social context). [...] It is consequently occasionally encountered, due to the influence of nigga, in Chicano English in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|On December 2, it was {{announced}} that Harper's plan was to ask the Governor General to prorogue parliament, delaying a confidence vote until the new year. The coalition leadership sent a letter to Jean—who, at the time, was abroad conducting state visits to various European countries—informing her of the events, upon the receipt of which, Jean announced that she would cut her trip short and return to Ottawa [...] "in light of the current political situation in Canada." [...] Harper visited the Governor General at Rideau Hall, at approximately 9:30 am ET, on December 4. After consulting with the Prime Minister and other advisors for more than two hours, Jean granted Harper's request and parliament was prorogued until January 26, 2009, with the Conservatives scheduled to announce the budget the following day. Near the end of her tenure as vicereine, Jean revealed to the Canadian Press that the two-hour delay in giving her decision was partly to [...] "send a message—and for people <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> warranted reflection." [...] She later stated in an interview on The Hour that [...] "I was in a position where I could have said no... And the decision had really to, in my mind, to be in the best interests, really, of the country, looking at all of the circumstances. And I have no regrets." ...|$|E
