5|$|He and Doctor Phlox then tend to Porthos, and Archer {{spends the}} night in Sickbay {{to be with his}} pet. Throughout <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> <b>as</b> Porthos' immune system weakens, Archer {{experiences}} Phlox's side of life in Sickbay. During <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> <b>as</b> he dreams of Porthos' funeral, Archer also deals with unresolved and suppressed sexual tension with T'Pol. He also relates to Phlox how he met Porthos, and how he was the last in a litter of four male puppies, the 'Four Musketeers'. Through it all, Archer struggles to reach an emotional understanding with Phlox and T'Pol, as the two alien senior-crew members have little grasp of the human-pet relationship, and Phlox keeps offering Archer unsolicited advice about dealing with his apparent feelings for T'Pol.|$|E

5|$|Eleanor of Castile {{had died}} on 28November 1290. Uncommon for such marriages of the period, the couple loved each other. Moreover, like his father, Edward was very {{devoted to his}} wife and was {{faithful}} to her throughout their married lives — a rarity among monarchs of the time. He was deeply affected by her death. He displayed his grief by erecting twelve so-called Eleanor crosses, one at each place where her funeral cortège stopped for <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> <b>As</b> part of the peace accord between England and France in 1294, it was agreed that Edward should marry Philip IV's half-sister Margaret, but the marriage was delayed by the outbreak of war.|$|E

The Thunder crowd jeered him loudly during pregame warmups, starter introductions, and whenever he touched the ball.|$|E
5|$|Pyrrhus {{failed to}} breach the Lacedaimonian defences and when night fell, he withdrew {{back to his}} camp. According to Plutarch, Pyrrhus {{received}} an omen during <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> <b>As</b> he slept, he dreamt of Sparta being smitten and set alight by thunderbolts coming from his own hand. While Pyrrhus {{and most of his}} counsellors interpreted the dream as indicating that they would seize Sparta by storm, his friend Lysimachus warned him that places struck by thunderbolts were usually avoided and that Pyrrhus was destined not to enter Sparta. Pyrrhus dismissed this interpretation and buoyed by what he deemed to be a portentous sign, he prepared his men for a further assault.|$|E

Chattar Lal rebuffs Indy's questions about the villagers' claims and his theory that the ancient Thuggee cult is responsible for their troubles. Later that night, Indy is attacked by an assassin, leading Indy, Willie, and Shorty to believe that something is amiss. They discover a series of tunnels hidden behind a statue in Willie's room {{and set out to}} explore them, overcoming a number of booby-traps along the way.|$|E

5|$|Wildfire {{intensity}} increases during daytime hours. For example, burn {{rates of}} smoldering logs {{are up to}} five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground {{during the day and}} causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>as</b> the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth.|$|E
5|$|Atlantic puffins are {{cautious}} {{when approaching}} the colony and no bird likes {{to land in}} a location where other puffins are not already present. They make several circuits of the colony before alighting. On the ground they spend much time preening, spreading oil from their preen gland and setting each feather in its correct position with beak or claw. They also spend time standing by their burrow entrances and interacting with passing birds. Dominance is shown by an upright stance, with fluffed chest feathers and cocked tail, an exaggerated slow walk, head jerking and gaping. Submissive birds lower their head and hold their body horizontal and scurry past dominant individuals. Birds normally signal their intention to take off by briefly lowering their body before running down the slope to gain momentum. If a bird is startled and takes off unexpectedly, a panic can spread through the colony with all the birds launching themselves {{into the air and}} wheeling around in a great circle. The colony is at its most active in the evening, with birds standing outside their burrows, resting on the turf or strolling around. Then the slopes empty for <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>as</b> the birds fly out to sea to roost, often choosing to do so at fishing grounds ready for early morning provisioning.|$|E
5|$|Finally in December, Matilda {{responded by}} {{escaping}} from the castle; the popular {{version of this}} has the Empress waiting until the Castle Mill Stream was frozen over and then dressed in white as camouflage in the snow, being lowered down the walls {{with three or four}} knights, before escaping through Stephen's lines in <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>as</b> the king's sentries tried to raise the alarm. The chronicler William of Malmesbury, however, suggests Matilda did not descend the walls, but instead escaped from one of the gates. Matilda safely reached Abingdon-on-Thames and Oxford Castle surrendered to Stephen the next day. Robert had died in the final weeks of the siege and the castle was granted to William de Chesney {{for the remainder of the}} war. At the end of the war the constableship of Oxford Castle was granted to Roger de Bussy before being reclaimed by Henry D'Oyly, Robert D'Oyly the younger's son, in 1154.|$|E

5|$|In {{the end the}} Māoris {{remained}} in position until 17 April. Throughout the previous two days the battalion worked hard to repel repeated attempts by elements of the German 2nd Infantry Regiment to infiltrate their lines, before they finally received the order to fall back. With isolated platoons still {{in contact with the}} Germans and amidst high winds and a heavy downpour of rain, the New Zealanders had difficulty disengaging. Withdrawing over difficult terrain towards the pass, the manoeuvre continued into <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>as</b> the Germans continued to harass their rearguard units. The move was carried out with considerable urgency because the intention was to blow a bridge up just after the battalion had withdrawn across it in order to delay the German advance. In the end the battalion only just made it, for the engineers tasked with carrying out the demolition had received the order to complete their task and were about to detonate when the battalion arrived shortly after 3:00am.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the known}} {{residents}} of Quahog are invited to a dinner party in his palatial mansion by James Woods, who states {{he has become a}} born-again Christian thanks to his new girlfriend Priscilla, and wishes to repent for all his wrongdoings. Early into <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> <b>as</b> Woods and Priscilla go to the kitchen, Quagmire's new companion, Stephanie, is mysteriously shot when she sits in Woods's seat, leading the guests to believe Woods intends to murder them all. They try to leave, but lightning strikes a tree, causing it to break the bridge. Meanwhile, the main road is flooded due to the storm. Returning amidst accusations, Woods pleads ignorance before he too is murdered in front of the guests by an unseen killer with a knife during a power outage, causing Priscilla to faint. Trapped on the remote estate with no way of contacting anyone due to a thunderstorm, the guests realize that the killer is among them. They also discover that Stephanie's body has disappeared.|$|E
5|$|New Year's Rockin' Eve was {{temporarily}} placed on hiatus for New Year's Eve 1999–2000. Instead, Clark participated in ABC News's day-long telecast, ABC 2000 Today, which {{as part of}} an international broadcast consortium, televised festivities from around the world celebrating the arrival of the year 2000. Clark joined host Peter Jennings and ABC News reporter Jack Ford as correspondents for the festivities from Times Square. Clark took on a similar role on ABC 2000 Today as he did on New Year's Rockin' Eve, including conducting his traditional countdown alongside Ford at midnight on the East Coast. However, unlike New Year's Rockin' Eve, festivities from Times Square were also broadcast live across the entire country instead of tape-delayed for the West Coast, since the special broadcast midnight festivities in other cities and time zones for the remainder of <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> <b>as</b> they had done throughout the day.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of January 29, Mậu and Khiêm alerted the rebel troops to assume their {{positions}} around Saigon. These included many of those used in the first coup: armored cars and tanks and some elements from the 5th and 7th Divisions, two airborne battalions and one Marine battalion {{and an assortment of}} Special Forces, Ranger and Civil Guard units. A number of American officers and embassy officials were alerted to be in their offices at 02:00. Lodge was kept fully informed throughout <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> <b>As</b> the time approached, Khánh donned his paratrooper uniform and headed to the military headquarters at Tan Son Nhut, where he saw that the compound was empty apart from a few guards. When he telephoned Khiêm, he found that his co-conspirator had overslept after having forgotten to set his alarm clock. Despite this, by daybreak, Khánh had taken over the government without a shot being fired.|$|E
5|$|Schmitt {{arrived at}} dusk, {{and the action}} {{continued}} well after dark; in mid-November night falls at close to 17:00 in the upper Danube climes. Despite the darkness, Schmitt descended out of the defiles and deployed his troops to assail Dupont's flank. As his Russians entered the fray, they came between a battalion of French and another of Russians. With the additional force, the French were overwhelmed, {{but most of the}} shooting subsided when the combatants could not tell apart friend from foe in the dark. Under the cover of darkness, aided by a waning moon, Mortier used the French flotilla to evacuate his exhausted troops to the south bank. The French and Russians continued to skirmish fitfully into <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>as</b> sentries encountered one another in the dark. Portions of Gazan's force provided any necessary rear guard action, and the following morning the remaining men were evacuated from the north shore of the Danube, while they maintained possession of only Spitz and Weissenkirchen on the north bank.|$|E

As she grows older, she becomes a generally well-behaved house dog, but when she is eight months old, she tries to attack a beloved mounted bald eagle belonging to the Master. He whips her and then locks her in a shed for <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>as</b> punishment; however, during the night it catches on fire. Lad desperately tries to break down the door to free her, then howls in agony, before jumping through its high window to join Lady inside.
