5|$|After leaving {{government}} service, Matlock has occasionally {{joined with}} other experts to criticize U.S. government policy. On June 26, 1997, he signed an Open Letter to Bill Clinton criticizing plans for NATO expansion. His reason for opposition, as given {{in his testimony}} before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is the belief <b>that</b> <b>NATO</b> expansion will preclude significant nuclear arms reduction with Russia, and consequently {{increase the risk of}} a terrorist nuclear attack.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December 1954, the North Atlantic Council {{approved}} MC 48, a key {{document in}} the evolution of NATO nuclear thought. MC 48 emphasized <b>that</b> <b>NATO</b> would have to use atomic weapons from the outset of a war with the Soviet Union whether or not the Soviets chose to use them first. This gave SACEUR the same prerogatives for automatic use of nuclear weapons as existed for the commander-in-chief of the US Strategic Air Command.|$|E

5|$|The {{structure}} of NATO evolved throughout the Cold War and its aftermath. An integrated military structure for NATO was first established in 1950 {{as it became}} clear <b>that</b> <b>NATO</b> would need to enhance its defences for the longer term against a potential Soviet attack. In April 1951, Allied Command Europe and its headquarters (SHAPE) were established; later, four subordinate headquarters were added in Northern and Central Europe, the Southern Region, and the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|Cheney {{publicly}} {{expressed concern}} that nations such as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, could acquire nuclear components {{after the collapse of}} the Soviet Union in 1991. The end of the Cold War, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact obliged the first Bush Administration to reevaluate the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO's) purpose and makeup. Cheney believed <b>that</b> <b>NATO</b> should remain the foundation of European security relationships and that it would remain important to the United States in the long term; he urged the alliance to lend more assistance to the new democracies in Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|However, in {{response}} to the Russian military intervention in Ukraine, Yatsenyuk announced his intentions to resume the bid for NATO integration on 29 August 2014, and in December 2014, Ukraine's parliament voted to drop the non-aligned status that it adopted in 2010. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has stated <b>that</b> <b>NATO</b> membership is still an option for Ukraine, and support for NATO membership has risen to 63.9 percent in government-controlled Ukraine according to a July 2015 poll. Previous polls had shown that the decline in opposition to membership was linked to the ongoing Russian intervention.|$|E
5000|$|Both the Non-Aligned Movement {{and critics}} inside <b>NATO</b> believe <b>that</b> <b>NATO's</b> nuclear sharing violates Articles I and II of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which {{prohibit}} the transfer and acceptance, respectively, of {{direct or indirect}} control over nuclear weapons.|$|R
50|$|Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov {{has stated}} <b>that</b> <b>NATO's</b> pattern of {{deployment}} of Patriot missiles indicates that {{these will be}} used to defend against Iranian missiles in addition to the stated goal of defending against spillover from the Syrian civil war.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept is}} most widely {{explored}} in Noam Chomsky's book The New Military Humanism: Lessons from Kosovo (1999) {{in which he}} argues <b>that</b> <b>NATO's</b> 1999 bombing of Kosovo was not conducted for humanitarian reasons but to further the military hegemony of western democratic powers such as the United States.|$|R
5|$|NATO leaders {{endorsed}} {{measures to}} improve NATO’s {{ability to take}} on operations when and where necessary, committing themselves to be able at all times to deploy and sustain larger proportions of their forces on operations {{in order to ensure}} <b>that</b> <b>NATO</b> has a permanently available pool of assets and forces that can deployed. They also endorsed changes to NATO’s defence planning, hoping that the Alliance’s long-term defence planning process would become more flexible, thereby helping member countries generate forces that can reach further, faster and still take on the full range of missions.|$|E
5|$|On 28 August 1995, {{a mortar}} shell {{slammed into a}} Sarajevo marketplace, killing 37 people. The United States {{subsequently}} blamed Bosnian Serb forces for the attack. Admiral Leighton Smith, the NATO commander, recommended <b>that</b> <b>NATO</b> launch retaliatory air strikes against the Serbs under the plan established for Operation Deliberate Force. On 30 August 1995, NATO officially launched Operation Deliberate Force with large-scale bombing of Serb targets. This bombing superseded Operation Deny Flight's role for air strikes and close air support, but Deny Flight remained an active operation, still enforcing the no-fly zone over Bosnia.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of NATO brought about some standardization of allied military terminology, procedures, and technology, which {{in many cases}} meant European countries adopting US practices. The roughly 1300Standardization Agreements (STANAG) codified many of the common practices <b>that</b> <b>NATO</b> has achieved. Hence, the 7.62×51mm NATO rifle cartridge {{was introduced in the}} 1950s as a standard firearm cartridge among many NATO countries. Fabrique Nationale de Herstal's FAL, which used the 7.62mm NATO cartridge, was adopted by 75 countries, including many outside of NATO. Also, aircraft marshalling signals were standardized, so that any NATO aircraft could land at any NATO base. Other standards such as the NATO phonetic alphabet have made their way beyond NATO into civilian use.|$|E
50|$|On 19 October 2004, it was {{confirmed}} <b>that</b> 115 <b>NATO</b> soldiers {{had been killed}} during the operation. After <b>that</b> 50 more <b>NATO</b> soldiers were confirmed to have died, including 42 Slovak soldiers in a military plane crash in Hungary.|$|R
5000|$|... The Turkish population, as {{a result}} of historical, cultural, and {{religious}} ties to the Balkans supported their government's anti-Serb and pro-NATO position. Turkey, a NATO member, supported and was involved in the bombing campaign though it expressed hesitation about a ground offensive. The Turkish government stressed <b>that</b> <b>NATO's</b> involvement was not about undermining Yugoslav territorial integrity, but about reversing the genocidal policies of the Milošević government.|$|R
5000|$|And {{while most}} members of the Indian {{strategic}} community readily admit <b>that</b> <b>NATO’s</b> Afghanistan mission coincides with India’s own strategic interest in stabilising that country, they do not necessarily conclude from this <b>that</b> India and <b>NATO</b> should develop closer cooperation. It is believed that many Indian analysts harbour doubts about the possible implications for their country’s international position should it develop closer ties with NATO. In a report published by NATO review it said, “The choice should be clear: exploiting NATO’s potential as a forum for consultation and cooperation is a 'win-win' situation, both for India and for the Alliance.” ...|$|R
5|$|In February 1991, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic and Slovakia (as Czechoslovakia) {{formed the}} Visegrád Group {{to push for}} European {{integration}} under the European Union and NATO, {{as well as to}} conduct military reforms in line with NATO standards. Internal NATO reaction to these former Warsaw Pact countries was initially negative, but by the 1991 Rome summit in November, members agreed to a series of goals that could lead to accession, such as market and democratic liberalization, and <b>that</b> <b>NATO</b> should be a partner in these efforts. In subsequent years, wider forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its eastern neighbors were set up, including the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (later the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council) and the Partnership for Peace.|$|E
5|$|On Wednesday, Assad sent Tlass to Moscow {{to seek a}} {{comprehensive}} air umbrella. The Soviets refused but prepared large amounts of military equipment at airfields for dispatch to Syria and sent Marshall Pavel Stepanovich Kutakhov to Syria {{to find out what}} happened to the Syrian SAMs, fearing <b>that</b> <b>NATO</b> might do the same in Eastern Europe. On June 9, Assad met with American envoy Habib in Damascus and rejected his terms, demanding that Israel withdraw its forces from Lebanon as a condition for a ceasefire. US President Ronald Reagan called on Begin and Assad to accept a ceasefire effective at 6:00 AM, on June 10. By noon on Friday, when the ceasefire took effect, the IAF had shot down 82 aircraft without losing any in air combat. A year after the battle, a US fact-finding mission headed by Lieutenant-General John Chain, then deputy chief of staff for plans and operations, arrived in Israel to learn lessons from the battle.|$|E
5|$|This {{programme}} is one {{of three}} programmes <b>that</b> <b>NATO</b> is pursuing in the area of missile defence. The contract puts the Alliance on track for having, by 2010, a system to protect troops on missions against ballistic missiles. The contract is worth approximately 75 million EUR for work that would be conducted over a period of six years. The theatre missile defence would be a multi-layered system of systems, comprising early warning system sensors, radar and various interceptors. While NATO member countries would provide the sensors and weapon systems, NATO itself would develop a commonly funded NATO architecture to integrate all of these elements. The development of the ALTBMD system was agreed by NATO members in large part because it is limited. NATO members are deeply divided about the multi-tiered BMD architecture promoted by the US Missile Defense Agency (MDA).|$|E

5|$|Comprehensive Political Guidance (CPG), {{a policy}} {{document}} {{that had been}} agreed by Defence Ministers in June 2006 and an addition to the 1999 Strategic Concept document, was formally endorsed during the summit. The CPG intends to provide a framework and political direction for NATO's continuing transformation in the coming 10 to 15 years. More specifically, the document expresses {{the belief that the}} principal threats to the Alliance in the coming decades are terrorism, proliferation, failing states, regional crises, misuse of new technologies, and disruption of the flow of vital resources. According to this document, the Alliance should adapt to these new threats and sets out the Alliance vis-a-vis capability issues, planning disciplines and intelligence for the next 10 to 15 years, including among others the need for joint expeditionary forces and the capability to deploy and sustain them over long periods of time. The document further underlined that NATO's forces should be able to conduct a variety of missions, from high to low intensity, and emphasized the likelihood <b>that</b> <b>NATO</b> will need to carry out a greater number and range of smaller operations. The CPG also confirmed the principle that 40% of the member states' military forces must be redeployable, and 8% must constantly be on operations abroad. This principle makes it, among other things, possible to effectively compare the contributions made by various states, irrespective of the size of their populations.|$|E
25|$|The Conservative Party upholds {{the view}} <b>that</b> <b>NATO</b> should remain the most {{important}} security alliance for the United Kingdom.

While previously regarded as a relatively low-cost intervention that goes beyond sanctions, the relatively forceful imposition of the Libyan no-fly zone means that the policy tool is now viewed with suspicion...|$|R
