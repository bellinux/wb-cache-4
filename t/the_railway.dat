5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of <b>the</b> <b>railway,</b> Cheadle Hulme was a rural and {{agricultural}} cluster of hamlets. <b>The</b> <b>railway</b> brought a huge influx of people to the area, and provided opportunities for residents to work {{in places such as}} Manchester. Cheadle Hulme gradually grew to become a large suburb of over 29,000people thanks to <b>the</b> <b>railway.</b>|$|E
5|$|From {{before midnight}} on 27 March, the tired 12th Brigade {{had been holding}} <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> line between Albert and Dernancourt, having {{relieved}} the 9th (Scottish) Division. The forward positions of the salient held by the 12th Brigade were along <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> line, which ran along a series of embankments and cuttings, up to but not including a railway bridge immediately northwest of Dernancourt where the Dernancourt–Laviéville road passed under <b>the</b> <b>railway.</b> A mushroom-shaped feature known as the Laviéville Heights overlooked <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> line, which curved around its foot. This was difficult ground to defend, particularly where <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> line curved and skirted the northwestern corner of Dernancourt, as if the line there was overrun, the enemy {{would be able to}} fire into the rear of the troops lined out along <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> in both directions. Despite this, the Australian commanders considered it important to hold <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> line; if it was not garrisoned, the enemy could assemble in the dead ground behind the embankment. A further difficulty arose from the fact that if an attack occurred during daylight, it would be almost impossible to move troops down the exposed slopes to reinforce <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> line without crippling losses, and troops withdrawing from <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> line would be similarly exposed. To afford them some protection along <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> line, the forward posts dug one-man niches in the near side of the embankment, but the only way for them to fire was to climb up and lie on top of the embankment, thus exposing themselves to enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|Sixteen {{coaches were}} {{originally}} {{built for the}} L in 1898, and another was built by <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> in 1911. Although most were broken up when <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> closed, several parts have survived, and have been retrieved and stored by <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> preservationists.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>railway</b> was {{constructed}} in 1899 and opened to passengers on 20 July 1903, following its electrification in 1902. After <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> grouping of 1923, passenger numbers declined so significantly that the hospital authorities no longer considered passenger usage of the line to be economical, and that service was withdrawn. <b>The</b> <b>railway</b> closed to freight in 1959, following the hospital's decision to convert its coal boilers to oil, which rendered <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|After an {{inspection}} by the Board of Trade, <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> opened to goods on 12 September 1854 and {{approval for the}} carriage of passengers was given two days later. <b>The</b> <b>railway</b> was officially opened on 19 September, and two locomotives hauling twenty-five carriages carrying 400 passengers left Kittybrewster at 11am. The number of passengers had grown to about 650 {{by the time the}} train arrived to a celebration at Huntly at 1:12pm. Public services began the following day.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the main}} canal was {{replaced}} by <b>the</b> <b>railway,</b> Kymer's dock continued {{to be used for}} the transfer of coal to coastal ships for another 50 years. Principal destinations included Laugharne, Carmarthen, St Clears and Llanstephan. The Kidwelly Corporation took out a lease on the dock in 1872, and <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> built a branch to it in 1873, which ran alongside the old canal. Most of the traffic had transferred to <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> by 1914, but some coasters continued to transport coal; the last recorded sailing was in the early 1920s, and was bound for Llanstephan.|$|E
50|$|Venlo {{railway station}} {{is located in}} Venlo, the Netherlands. It is {{situated}} on <b>the</b> Maastricht-Venlo <b>railway,</b> <b>the</b> Viersen-Venlo <b>railway,</b> <b>the</b> Venlo-Eindhoven <b>railway</b> and <b>the</b> Nijmegen-Venlo <b>railway.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>railways</b> {{constructed}} and upgraded under <b>the</b> <b>Railways</b> (Standard Gauge) Construction Act 1961 form {{the backbone of}} <b>the</b> freight <b>railway</b> network in Perth.|$|R
50|$|Alongside {{the station}} is <b>the</b> <b>railway's</b> Aylsham Locomotive Depot, a large three-track engine shed, capable of housing all <b>the</b> <b>railway's</b> {{locomotive}}s. Behind <b>the</b> locomotive depot is <b>the</b> <b>railway's</b> main engineering workshop, equipped to carry out running repairs or full-scale locomotive overhauls. This facility also contains locker rooms, wash rooms, and administrative offices for <b>the</b> <b>railway's</b> engineers.|$|R
5|$|Between May and July 1918, {{military}} stores from White City, Wormwood Scrubs and Baker Street {{were moved}} to the site, with items kept in the completed sheds. A shortage of bricks in October meant the widening of the bridge over <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> was delayed, as was the construction of <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> line into the site.|$|E
5|$|By 14:00 the 4th Parachute Brigade was {{no further}} forward. With {{casualties}} mounting, Brigadier Hackett asked General Urquhart's permission to withdraw south of <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> line. His {{intention was to}} move through Wolfheze and into Oosterbeek where the division's support units waited. The change of direction was further complicated {{by the lack of}} vehicle crossings along <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> line—there were only two, one at Wolfheze and the other at Oosterbeek.|$|E
5|$|By early December 1916, {{construction}} of <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> {{had reached the}} wells at Bir el Mazar, the last water sources available to the EEF before El Arish. Bir el Mazar was about half way between Kantara on the Suez Canal and the Egyptian-Ottoman territorial border. British intelligence had reported Ottoman Army plans to strengthen the garrison at Magdhaba, by extending <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> (or light rail) south east from Beersheba (and Hafir el Auja) towards Magdhaba.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>railways</b> of Great Britain were [...] "grouped" [...] {{under the}} terms of <b>the</b> <b>Railways</b> Act 1921, {{effective}} from 1 January 1923 (although some effective dates were shortly before or after that date).

5|$|Charles met Frederick Kemp, a {{land agent}} newly arrived in Poulton {{from his native}} Essex, and {{introduced}} him to his brother, {{who was on the}} lookout for a steward or agent. Kemp, well-dressed and charming, made a good impression on Hesketh, who employed him immediately. At the meeting of <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> committee Hesketh put forward a persuasive argument. Despite opposition from the Lytham contingent the committee decided that Rossall Point was the best place for <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> terminus to be built, and <b>the</b> <b>Railway</b> and Port Company was formed. In the early 19th century it was thought that steam locomotives would be unable to negotiate hilly terrain, and that Lake District hills like Shap Fell would prevent <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> from reaching Scotland. The Fylde terminus would have even more importance than Hesketh had hoped, providing a sea link for passengers from London to travel on to Scotland. Initially Hesketh had considered naming his new town New Liverpool or Wyreton, but after changing his name to Hesketh-Fleetwood in 1831 he decided to call it Fleetwood. With a new career in parliament to prepare for, he readily handed over financial management of the project to his manager, Frederick Kemp.|$|E
5|$|East Midlands Trains operate direct {{trains to}} London St Pancras International from Wellingborough railway station, departing every 30 minutes, {{with an average}} journey time of around 55 minutes. <b>The</b> <b>railway</b> line also connects Wellingborough with Bedford, Luton, Kettering, Corby, Leicester, Nottingham, Derby, Sheffield and Leeds. Just north of <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> station is a GB Railfreight location, usage is for London Underground {{maintenance}} and other freight services.|$|E
5|$|Following the battalion's move up <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> line in July, Blackader was {{transferred}} to a new post at Balmoral; as well as <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> station, he was made responsible for a civilian concentration camp outside the town. These camps were frequently crowded, unhealthy, and badly supplied; few reports have survived on the Balmoral camp, however, {{and it is not}} clear how efficient or otherwise Blackader's administration was.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> North British <b>Railway</b> was a {{constituent}} {{of the new}} London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) from 1923, following <b>the</b> <b>Railways</b> Act 1921 and <b>the</b> <b>railways</b> were again re-organised by Government in 1948, when <b>the</b> <b>railways</b> were nationalised, <b>the</b> local lines being part of British Railways Scottish Region.|$|R
5000|$|Two <b>railways,</b> <b>the</b> Jersey Western <b>Railway</b> in 1870, and <b>the</b> Jersey Eastern <b>Railway</b> in 1874, were opened. <b>The</b> western <b>railway</b> from [...] to La Corbière and <b>the</b> eastern <b>railway</b> from [...] to Gorey Pier. <b>The</b> two <b>railways</b> {{have never}} been connected.

5|$|Important {{features}} {{incorporated in}} the line include four loops (spirals) and four 'Z' reverses (zigzags). The introduction of bogie carriages allowed for {{the replacement of the}} basic four wheel carriages formerly used for support and stability. In 1897, a major earthquake damaged <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> requiring rebuilding of the route, including extensive improvements to the track and stations. Further modernization occurred as part of the Northeast Frontier Railway Zone. Most trains on the route are still powered by steam engines, although a modern diesel engine is used for the Darjeeling Mail train. <b>The</b> <b>railway</b> is notable for its signage located at key vantage points, marking locations with titles such as Agony Point and Sensation Corner. Spirals located on steep hills are a feature of <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> that provide scenic views of the valleys below.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 the Norwegian National Rail Administration {{warned that}} lack of funding {{might lead to a}} closure of all long-distance {{passenger}} trains in Norway, including the Bergen Line. Torild Skogsholm, Minister of Transport and Communications assured that it was not the government's policy to close railway lines. In 2004 the Progress Party suggested closing down <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> line and replacing it with a motorway between Bergen and Oslo, arguing that <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> was unprofitable, and that bus transport was cheaper while easier truck transport would aid business. Other political parties rejected the proposal pointing out the better environmental performance of <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> and that <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> transports large volumes of freight.|$|E

5|$|In {{common with}} most canals, {{competition}} from railways posed a major threat, and in 1845 the canal owners {{agreed to sell}} it to the Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway when their line from Ambergate to Grantham was opened. Although <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> was completed in 1850, <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> company did not honour the agreement. The canal company brought a large number of cases against <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> company, and successfully opposed several bills which <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> were trying to get passed in Parliament. Eventually <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> company agreed to pay, and shareholders received £45 per share in cash, with the balance being in railway mortgages. The agreement was reached on 1 June 1854, and the transfer of ownership took place on 20 December. Railway mergers meant that the canal came {{under the control of the}} Great Northern Railway in 1861, and later the London and North Eastern Railway.|$|E
5|$|In fact, <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> caused mass-produced {{goods from}} {{northern}} England to flood into central Wales.|$|E
50|$|In 1914, <b>the</b> <b>railways</b> {{were taken}} into Government control due to World War I, but were {{returned}} to the original owners in 1921, {{three years after the}} war had ended. However, in that same year, the government introduced <b>the</b> <b>Railways</b> Act 1921. This forced <b>the</b> 120 <b>railway</b> companies then operating to merge into just four. This grouping officially took place on 1 January 1923. <b>The</b> four <b>railway</b> companies formed from the grouping were: <b>The</b> Great Western <b>Railway,</b> <b>the</b> Southern <b>Railway,</b> <b>the</b> London and North Eastern <b>Railway,</b> and <b>the</b> London, Midland and Scottish Railway. In Britain during World War II, <b>the</b> <b>railways</b> {{were taken into}} State control. They were heavily damaged by enemy attacks and were run down aiding the war effort. After the war, the Transport Act 1947 provided for nationalizing <b>the</b> four major <b>railways.</b> On January 1, 1948, <b>the</b> <b>railways</b> were nationalized and British Railways was created, under the overall management of the British Transport Commission, later <b>the</b> British <b>Railways</b> Board.|$|R
