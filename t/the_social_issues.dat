25|$|The Book of Lamentations by Gregory of Narek (951–1003) is {{an example}} of the {{development}} of a literature and writing style of Old Armenian by the 10th century. In addition to elevating the literary style and vocabulary of the Armenian language by adding about well above a thousand new words, through his other hymns and poems Gregory paved the way for his successors to include secular themes and vernacular language in their writings. The thematic shift from mainly religious texts to writings with secular outlooks further enhanced and enriched the vocabulary. “A Word of Wisdom”, a poem by Hovhannes Sargavak devoted to a starling, legitimizes poetry devoted to nature, love, or female beauty. Gradually, the interests of the population at large were reflected in other literary works as well. Konsdantin Yerzinkatsi and several others even take the unusual step of criticizing the ecclesiastic establishment and addressing <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>issues</b> of the Armenian homeland. However, these changes represented the nature of the literary style and syntax, but they did not constitute immense changes to the fundamentals of the grammar or the morphology of the language. Often, when writers codify a spoken dialect, other language users are then encouraged to imitate that structure through the literary device known as parallelism.|$|E

40|$|The {{benefits}} to a corporate sponsor of {{two types of}} philanthropic activities [...] cause promotions and advocacy advertising [...] are examined. Results from four laboratory studies indicate that perceptions of corporate sponsorship responsibility (CSR) are affected by consumers’ elaboration levels. Consumer perceptions of CSR are more favorable for cause promotions, which do not receive much elaboration, than they are for advocacy advertising, which prompts more elaboration. In addition, perceived congruence between the sponsor and <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>issue</b> is shown to moderate these effects: higher congruence between <b>the</b> sponsor and <b>social</b> <b>issue</b> increases favorable ratings of CSR for cause promotions, but only if elaboration on the sponsorship activity is facilitated. On the other hand, lower congruence increases favorable ratings of CSR for advocacy advertising as long as elaboration on the sponsorship is not constrained. We also find that higher congruence enhances CSR ratings if participants are primed to focus their attention on the sponsor brand, while lower congruence enhances CSR if participants are primed to focus their attention on <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>issue.</b> ...|$|R
500|$|The Great Seimas of Vilnius ( [...] , {{also known}} as the Great Assembly of Vilnius, the Grand Diet of Vilnius, or the Great Diet of Vilnius) was a major {{assembly}} held on December 4 and 5, 1905 (November 21–22, 1905 O.S.) in Vilnius, Lithuania, then part of the Russian Empire, largely inspired by the Russian Revolution of 1905. It was the first modern national congress in Lithuania and dealt primarily not with <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>issues</b> that sparked the revolution, but with national concerns. Over 2,000 participants took part in the Seimas. The assembly made the decision to demand wide political autonomy within the Russian Empire and achieve this by peaceful means.

500|$|Kooman made justice {{the focus}} of She Has a Name; <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>issues</b> that {{interest}} him include poverty, the HIV/AIDS epidemic, {{and the effects of}} war. The central issues in She Has a Name are gender-based. The general topic of the play is human traffickingspecifically the trafficking of children into sexual slavery. Kooman has stated that She Has a Name [...] "suggests that justice can only be realized if real people know, care and take informed and decisive action." [...] The victimized child in the play is known only by the number 18 to reflect that traffickers often dehumanize their victims by giving them a new name or simply a number, which in some cases is branded onto the victim's body. After his rape of Number 18, the pimp leaves the situation without adverse effect, but Number 18 is left bleeding from her crotch and mouth. The play invites viewers to feel sympathetic towards Number 18, and, although the world of human trafficking is depicted as horrific and ugly, both the victims and perpetrators of human trafficking are portrayed as relatable characters, suggesting that every individual has inherent value and dignity. In an interview with The Calgary Journal prior to the 2012 tour, Waldschmidt said that the sympathetic portrayal of the perpetrators prevents the play from becoming a simplistic story of good and evil. According to Liz Nicholls of the Edmonton Journal, Number 18 is a nuanced character, better-developed than the stock damsel in distress.|$|E
500|$|Although it is {{difficult}} to establish the exact origin of the dictator novel in the nineteenth century, its intellectual influence spans Latin American Literature. Most of the novels were written in the middle [...] years of the twentieth century, and each has a unique literary style that employed techniques of the “new novel”, by which the writer rejected the formal structure of conventional literary realism, arguing that “its simplistic assumption that reality is easily observable” is a narrative flaw. As a genre, the dictator novel redefined the literary concept of “the novel” in order to compel the readers to examine the ways in which political and social mores affect their daily lives. Therefore, the regional politics and <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>issues</b> of the stories yielded to universal human concerns, thus the traditional novel’s “ordered world view gives way to a fragmented, distorted or fantastic narrative” in which the reader has an intellectually active role in grasping the thematic gist of the story. Additional to the narrative substance, the novelists redefined the formal literary categories of author, narrator, character, plot, story, and reader, in order to examine the etymological link between “author” and “authority”, wherein the figure of the novelist (the author) became very important to the telling of the tale. In the dictator novels, the writers questioned the traditional story-teller role of the novelist as the “privileged, paternal figure, as the authoritative ‘father’, or divine creator, in whom meaning would be seen to originate”, and so, the novelists fulfilled the role of the dictator.|$|E
