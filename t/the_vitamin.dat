5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of the de novo pathway, the salvage reactions are essential in humans; a lack of niacin in the diet causes <b>the</b> <b>vitamin</b> deficiency disease pellagra. This high requirement for NAD results from the constant consumption of the coenzyme in reactions such as posttranslational modifications, since the cycling of NAD between oxidized and reduced forms in redox reactions does not change the overall levels of the coenzyme.|$|E

5|$|In organisms, NAD can be {{synthesized}} {{from simple}} building-blocks (de novo) from the amino acids tryptophan or aspartic acid. In an alternative fashion, more complex {{components of the}} coenzymes are taken up from food as <b>the</b> <b>vitamin</b> called niacin. Similar compounds are released by reactions that break down the structure of NAD. These preformed components then pass through a salvage pathway that recycles {{them back into the}} active form. Some NAD is also converted into nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP); the chemistry of this related coenzyme {{is similar to that of}} NAD, but it has different roles in metabolism.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>vitamins,</b> though {{required}} {{in small amounts}} in the diet, play major roles in growth, physiology and metabolism of the animal. Their absence in the diet causes major deficiency syndromes. Also, <b>the</b> <b>vitamins</b> should be present in optimum levels in the diet; any excess in certain <b>vitamins</b> in <b>the</b> diet causes pathological symptoms and inhibit growth.

40|$|Biofunctional nanohybrids are {{synthesized}} from layered double hydroxide (LDH) and <b>the</b> <b>vitamins</b> such as {{ascorbic acid}} and topopherol acid succinate.

No significant change in UV-Vis and IR absorption characteristics of <b>the</b> intercalated <b>vitamins</b> strongly supports <b>the</b> safe maintenance of their bioactivities without any deterioration of chemical and structural integrity.

5|$|Storage can be {{short-term}} or long-term. Most {{vegetables are}} perishable and short-term storage {{for a few}} days provides flexibility in marketing. During storage, leafy vegetables lose moisture, and <b>the</b> <b>vitamin</b> C in them degrades rapidly. A few products such as potatoes and onions have better keeping qualities and can be sold when higher prices may be available, and by extending the marketing season, a greater total volume of crop can be sold. If refrigerated storage is not available, the priority for most crops is to store high-quality produce, to maintain a high humidity level, and to keep the produce in the shade.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, most fruits rich in vitamin C, such as oranges, became {{difficult}} to obtain in the United Kingdom. Since blackcurrant berries are {{a rich source of}} <b>the</b> <b>vitamin</b> and blackcurrant plants are suitable for growing in the UK climate, the British Government encouraged their cultivation and soon the yield of the nation's crop increased significantly. From 1942 onwards, blackcurrant syrup was distributed free of charge to {{children under the age of}} two, and this may have given rise to the lasting popularity of blackcurrant as a flavouring in Britain. In Britain the commercial crop is completely mechanised and about 1,400 hectares of the fruit are grown, mostly under contract to the juicing industry. Commercially, most large-scale cultivation of blackcurrants is done in eastern Europe for the juice and juice concentrate market.|$|E
