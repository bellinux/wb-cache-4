40|$|A large scale, {{variable-geometry inlet}} {{system with a}} design Mach number of 3. 0 was tested at Mach numbers from 0. 6 to 1. 28. Variable {{features}} for off-design operation are an adjustable-height ramp system and a <b>translating</b> <b>cowl.</b> Experimental results are presented for transonic ramp and cowl positions showing the effect of throat boundary layer bleed and vortex generators on engine-face performance. Detailed pressure and force-balance data are used to evaluate transonic drag characteristics...|$|E
40|$|A {{preliminary}} investigation {{was conducted in}} quiescent air on a <b>translating</b> <b>cowl</b> technique for improving the take-off performance of a sharp-lip supersonic diffuser. The technique consists of cutting the cowling in a plane normal to its axis and then translating the forepart of the cowling in the forward direction. The {{leading edge of the}} fixed portion of the cowling is rounded. Appreciable improved inlet performance was obtained with a cowling translation corresponding to a gap of only 1 / 4 inlet radius...|$|E
40|$|A 38. 8 -cm (15. 28 -in.) capture {{diameter}} {{model of}} a mixed-compression axisymmetric inlet system with a <b>translating</b> <b>cowl</b> was designed and tested. The internal contours, designed for Mach number 2. 65, provided a throat area of 59 percent of the capture area when the cowl was retracted for transonic operation. Other model features included a boundary-layer removal system, vortex generators, an engine airflow bypass system, cowl support struts, and rotating rakes at the engine face. All tunnel testing was conducted at a tunnel total pressure of about 1 atm (a unit Reynolds number of about 8. 53 million/m at Mach number 2. 65) at angles of attack from 0 deg to 4 deg. Results for the following were obtained: total-pressure recovery and distortion at the engine face {{as a function of}} bleed mass-flow ratio, the effect of bleed and vortex generator configurations on pressure recovery and distortion, inlet tolerance to unstart due to changes in angle of attack or Mach number, surface pressure distributions, boundary-layer profiles, and transonic additive drag. At Mach number 2. 65 and with the best bleed configurations, maximum total pressure recovery at the engine face ranged from 91 to 94. 5 percent with bleed mass-flow ratios from 4 to 9 percent, respectively, and total-pressure distortion was less than 10 percent. At off-design supersonic Mach numbers above 1. 70, maximum total-pressure recoveries and corresponding bleed mass flows were about the same as at Mach number 2. 65, with about 10 to 15 percent distortion. In the transonic Mach number range, total pressure recovery was high (above 96 percent) and distortion was low (less than 15 percent) only when the inlet mass-flow ration was reduced 0. 02 to 0. 06 from the maximum theoretical value (0. 590 at Mach number 1. 0) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{design and}} performance analysis of two exhaust nozzles considered {{for use on}} a vehicle following an accelerating flight profile to a maximum flight speed corresponding to Mach 4. 2 is presented. The vehicle operational requirements were set by the Air Vehicle Baseline Study commissioned by the Office of Naval Research. An afterburning engine cycle was assumed {{in the design and}} analysis process. The two nozzles investigated here were an axisymmetric convergent-divergent (C-D) nozzle with variable throat and exit area and an isentropic plug nozzle with variable throat area enabled by a <b>translating</b> outer <b>cowl.</b> Computational fluid dynamics was used to assist in the design process and to investigate the installed performance of the two nozzles at flight points from Mach 1. 2 to Mach 4. 2. For both nozzle configurations, the nozzles could not achieve perfectly expanded exit areas at the highest Mach numbers in order for the nozzle exit area to not exceed the vehicle cross sectional area. At the lower Mach numbers, the installed performance of the C-D nozzle was higher than that of the plug nozzle while at the highest Mach numbers, the performance of the two nozzles was similar...|$|R
