5|$|Armed with a gun, Neelambari {{reaches the}} temple where Chandru and Anitha are married. In anger, {{she tries to}} kill Padayappa. However, Padayappa saves her life when he {{prevents}} a bull from attacking her, {{while at the same}} time dodging the bullets she fires at him. Rather than live with <b>the</b> <b>humiliation</b> <b>of</b> knowing she was unsuccessful in avenging her father's death, as well as having her life saved by her enemy, Neelambari commits suicide, promising to take revenge on Padayappa in her next birth. Padayappa prays for her soul to be at peace and eventually attain salvation.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of <b>the</b> <b>humiliation</b> <b>of</b> Casey, {{the deaths of}} the topmen, and the severe punishment {{of the rest of the}} sailors appears to have driven the crew to mutiny. These factors, however, were arguably the final events in a series of harsh and brutal punishments by the captain. Dudley Pope, in his book The Black Ship, argues that it was not Pigot's cruelty that drove the men to mutiny but the general injustice that he showed in his favouritism to some and overly harsh punishment of others. Had Pigot remained more even-handed in his leadership, the mutiny might have been avoided.|$|E
5|$|Whilst {{the civil}} war was raging, the Turks in Anatolia took the {{opportunity}} to seize Philadelphia in 1390, marking the end of Byzantine rule in Anatolia, although by now the city was far from Imperial rule. The city had long been under only nominal Imperial rule and its fall was of little strategic consequence to the Byzantines – whose Emperor had to suffer <b>the</b> <b>humiliation</b> <b>of</b> accompanying the Sultan during the campaign.|$|E

50|$|His sixth book, {{a comedy}} {{entitled}} Less, {{was published by}} Lee Boudreaux books in 2017. It is the comedy of a man fleeing <b>the</b> <b>humiliations</b> <b>of</b> love, middle-age, and failure by accepting invitations that lead to a trip {{around the world and}} back, at last, to face his final demon: himself. An excerpt was published in The New Yorker.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{integration}} of southern Vietnam into the central administration, newly appointed imperial officials arrived in Saigon. The new mandarins carried out a detailed inquiry into Duyệt's rule and claimed that widespread corruption and abuse of power took place. Bạch Xuân Nguyên, {{the head of the}} inquiry, called for Duyet's posthumous prosecution, which resulted in 100 lashes being applied to his grave. Many of Duyệt's subordinates were arrested and 16 of his family members were executed. This action prompted the Duyệt's officials—fearful of their positions and security under the central system—to launch a revolt under the leadership of his adopted son Lê Văn Khôi. Historical opinion is divided with scholars contesting whether <b>the</b> <b>humiliation</b> <b>of</b> Duyệt or the loss of southern autonomy was the main catalyst.|$|E
5|$|President Sadat {{believed}} that Egypt's economic, political, social and military problems were {{a result of}} the Six Day War. He believed the solution to these problems lay with erasing <b>the</b> <b>humiliation</b> <b>of</b> the 1967 defeat, which required regaining the Sinai. In 1971 Sadat began the coordinated political and military groundwork to achieve this. In February, he proposed a phased Israel withdrawal from the Sinai, which would involve a reopening of the Suez Canal, and Israeli fulfillment of the UNSCR 242, including resolving the Palestinian refugee problem. In return Egypt would sign a peace treaty with Israel and reestablish relations with the United States. However Israeli insistence on retention of territory necessary for its security ended diplomatic efforts.|$|E
5|$|Following the Empire-wide seizure and {{imprisonment}} of all Venetians in March 1171, the Byzantine fleet {{was strong}} enough to deter an outright attack by the Venetians, who sailed to Chios and settled for negotiations. Manuel sent a fleet of 150 ships under Kontostephanos to confront them there and employed delaying tactics, until, weakened by disease, the Venetians began to withdraw and were pursued by Kontostephanos' fleet. It was a remarkable reversal of fortunes, compared with <b>the</b> <b>humiliation</b> <b>of</b> 1125. In 1177, another fleet of 70 galleys and 80 auxiliary ships under Kontostephanos, destined for Egypt, returned home after appearing off Acre, as Count Philip of Flanders and many important nobles of the Kingdom of Jerusalem refused to participate in the campaign. However, by the end of Manuel's reign, the strains of constant warfare on all fronts and the Emperor's various grandiose projects had become evident: the historian Niketas Choniates attributes the rise of piracy in the latter years of Manuel's reign to the diversion of the funds intended for the maintenance of the fleet for other needs of the imperial treasury.|$|E

To drive away from the palace, where she had been more than queen, under the scornful eyes and bitter gibes of so many {{personal}} enemies!

5|$|Gaveston was not exiled immediately; he did {{not have}} to leave the realm until 25 June, but faced excommunication by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Winchelsey, should he return. Edward used the {{intervening}} period to provide for his favourite's continued prosperity and political importance. As a compensation for the loss of the earldom of Cornwall, which was another condition of the exile, Gaveston was granted land worth 3,000 marks annually in Gascony, and land amounting to the same value in England. Further to this, he was appointed the King's Lieutenant of Ireland, so that a certain amount of honour could be maintained despite <b>the</b> <b>humiliation</b> <b>of</b> the exile. The appointment came the day after Richard de Burgh, Earl of Ulster, had been given the same position, indicating that it was an improvised measure. Gaveston's appointment came with wider authority than Ulster's, however, for he had full regal powers to appoint and dismiss any royal officers.|$|E
5|$|Hancock's only {{significant}} military defeat {{occurred during the}} Siege of Petersburg. His II Corps moved south of the city, along the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad, tearing up track. On August 25, Confederate Maj. Gen. Henry Heth attacked and overran the faulty Union position at Reams's Station, shattering the II Corps, capturing many prisoners. Despite a later victory at Hatcher's Run, <b>the</b> <b>humiliation</b> <b>of</b> Reams's Station contributed, along with the lingering effects of his Gettysburg wound, to his decision to give up field command in November. He left the II Corps after {{a year in which}} it had suffered over 40,000 casualties, but had achieved significant military victories. His next assignment was to command the ceremonial First Veteran Corps. He performed more recruiting, commanded the Middle Department, and relieved Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan in command of forces in the now-quiet Shenandoah Valley. He was promoted to brevet major general in the regular army for his service at Spotsylvania, effective March 13, 1865.|$|E
5|$|In August 1805, the French Grande Armée {{invaded the}} German states {{in hopes of}} {{knocking}} Austria {{out of the war}} before Russian forces could intervene. On 25 September, after great secrecy and feverish marching, 200,000 French troops began to cross the Rhine on a front of 160 miles (260km). Mack had gathered the greater part of the Austrian army at the fortress of Ulm in Bavaria. Napoleon hoped to swing his forces northward and perform a wheeling movement that would find the French at the Austrian rear. The Ulm Maneuver was well executed, and on 20 October Mack and 23,000 Austrian troops surrendered at Ulm, bringing the total number of Austrian prisoners in the campaign to 60,000. The French captured Vienna in November and went on to inflict a decisive defeat on a Russo-Austrian army at Austerlitz in early December. Austerlitz led to the expulsion of Russian troops from Central Europe and <b>the</b> <b>humiliation</b> <b>of</b> Austria, which signed the Treaty of Pressburg on 26 December.|$|E

5|$|Kartik struggled, taking 2/129 against East {{and then}} 0/178 {{in the first}} innings as North Zone {{accumulated}} 8/690 declared. He then had to endure <b>the</b> <b>humiliation</b> <b>of</b> not being trusted to bowl in the second innings as North reached 8/233. In the last match against South, Kartik could only aggregate 1/87. Although Kartik had scored 45 and 27 in his two innings, he totalled only three Duleep Trophy wickets {{at an average of}} 131.33. The selectors were unsatisfied by these performances, and despite a shoulder injury to Kumble, Kartik was discarded as India hosted Australia in the 2001 Border Gavaskar Trophy. Harbhajan was recalled and took 32 wickets at 17 to engineer an Indian series win and permanently establish himself as India's leading spinner alongside Kumble. Kartik played in one more match for Railways {{at the end of the}} season, and his poor season continued, managing only a total of 2/152, although he did score 79 with the bat.|$|E

50|$|The Reformed divines refer them to both natures; so that Christ's {{human nature}} {{was in a}} state <b>of</b> <b>humiliation</b> as {{compared}} with its future exaltation, and his divine nature was in <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> <b>humiliation</b> as to its external manifestation (ratione occultationis).
