50|$|A <b>tally</b> stick (or simply <b>tally)</b> was {{an ancient}} memory aid device used to record and {{document}} numbers, quantities, or even messages. <b>Tally</b> sticks first appear as animal bones carved with notches during the Upper Paleolithic; a notable {{example is the}} Ishango Bone. Historical reference is made by Pliny the Elder (AD 23-79) about the best wood to use for <b>tallies,</b> and by Marco Polo (1254-1324) who mentions {{the use of the}} <b>tally</b> in China. <b>Tallies</b> have been used for numerous purposes such as messaging and scheduling, and especially in financial and legal transactions, {{to the point of being}} currency.|$|R
50|$|Three {{anonymous}} judges for Baron's Hall use a <b>tally</b> {{sheet to}} determine the awards. The judges give one <b>tally</b> mark for every year that a student participated in an activity. (example: football = 1 <b>tally</b> mark in the designated box). If a student has achieved letters/bars or has had a leadership position, one point is appointed for each. (example: football captain = 1 <b>tally</b> mark; a letter and two bars in cross country = 3 <b>tally</b> marks). The <b>tally</b> sheet is arranged by category; by the end, it is obvious which seniors deserve awards. Four to eight seniors are chosen per category.|$|R
5|$|Anthony Minichiello {{holds the}} record for the most first grade games (302), having surpassed Luke Ricketson's tally of 301 matches in round 3 of the finals in 2014. Former team captain Craig Fitzgibbon holds the club record for scoring the most points, <b>tallying</b> 1,376 over his 210 matches. Fitzgibbon also broke the all-time point scoring record for a forward in the later rounds of 2006. Dave Brown's tally of 45 points (five tries and 15 goals) in a single match against Canterbury in 1935 remains a {{competition}} record after more than seven decades. Ivan Cleary scored 284 points in 1998, which at the time was an all-time points scoring record in a season.|$|E
5|$|During the 2006–07 season, Lapierre {{received}} {{four separate}} call-ups from Hamilton. Playing {{in the first}} game of a call-up in December, he registered his first career NHL point in a 4–3 win against the Boston Bruins, earning the first assist on the game-winning goal by Guillaume Latendresse on December 12, 2006. The following game, he scored his first NHL goal in a 4–2 win against the Tampa Bay Lightning, tipping a Mike Komisarek shot past goaltender Marc Denis. In late-January 2007, he received his last call-up of the campaign, remaining with the club {{until the end of the}} NHL regular season. Over 46 NHL games, he recorded six goals and six assists, while also <b>tallying</b> 24 points over 37 games in the AHL.|$|E
5|$|In January 1994, over 60,000 third–sixth {{graders in}} the state of Oklahoma {{selected}} from Shiloh 23 nominees as the winner of the Sequoyah Children's Book Award. The Sequoyah Award was presented to Naylor in April 1994 during the yearly Oklahoma Library Association conference. On April 14, 1994, at the annual conference of the Missouri Association of School Librarians, Shiloh received that year's Mark Twain Readers Award. The Mark Twain Award is decided annually through a vote by fourth–eighth graders {{in the state}} of Missouri. On October 29, 1994, Naylor received the William Allen White Children's Book Award for Shiloh. The award is decided through the <b>tallying</b> of over 55,000 children {{in the state of}} Kansas.|$|E

5|$|The Democrats' success {{continued}} in the down-ballot races. Democratic city commissioners Maurice S. Osser and Thomas P. McHenry were reelected as was Republican Walter I. Davidson. William M. Lennox was reelected county sheriff and Joseph A. Scanlon was reelected {{clerk of the court}} of quarter sessions (a court whose jurisdiction is now exercised by the court of common pleas). The Democrats also took four of the seven magisterial district judge positions up for election that year (a local court, the duties of which are now performed by the Philadelphia Municipal Court). The ballot contained two referendums authorizing the city to take loans for construction of medical facilities, streets, sewers, playgrounds, and other civic improvements. They passed with overwhelming support, each <b>tallying</b> 84% affirmative votes.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptologists {{identifying}} Sheshi with Salitis follow Josephus, Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius {{who report}} that Manetho credited Salitis with 19 years of reign in his Aegyptiaca. Ryholt relies instead on a statistical method and estimates {{the duration of}} Sheshi's reign to have been between 20 and 53 years. The method consists in <b>tallying</b> the seals of Yakbim Sekhaenre, Ya'ammu Nubwoserre, Qareh Khawoserre and 'Ammu Ahotepre with those of Sheshi. Then, knowing that the first four of these kings reigned for at least c. 30 years, implies that they have left between 7.5 and 20 seals per year on throne. Consequently, Sheshi's nearly 400 scarabs would correspond to 20 to 53 years, which Ryholt gives as c. 40 years.|$|E
40|$|Zero {{variance}} {{procedures have}} been in existence {{since the dawn of}} Monte Carlo. Previous works all treat the problem of zero variance solutions for a single <b>tally.</b> One often wants to get low variance solutions to more than one <b>tally.</b> When the sets of random walks needed for two <b>tallies</b> are similar, it is more efficient to do zero variance biasing for both <b>tallies</b> in the same Monte Carlo run, instead of two separate runs. The theory presented here correlates the random walks of particles by the similarity of their <b>tallies.</b> Particles with dissimilar <b>tallies</b> rapidly become uncorrelated whereas particles with similar <b>tallies</b> will stay correlated through most of their random walk. The theory herein should allow practitioners to make efficient use of zero-variance biasing procedures in practical problems...|$|R
50|$|Peris is <b>Tally's</b> {{childhood}} friend.

He is also a very understated character throughout the series. Peris was <b>Tally's</b> best friend until he left her to jump alone off the hot air-balloon.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a computer program, provisionally named Krempe, {{developed for the}} analysis and presentation of mesh and other <b>tallies</b> from Monte Carlo radiation transport codes MCNP and MCNPX. Data along a line can be extracted from mesh <b>tallies</b> and the profile plotted. Peaks in the profile can be fitted to a Gaussian. We describe {{the use of such}} a fit to obtain a measure of the spatial spreading of a particle beam. Smoothing functions are available to average over noise. Additional fitting functions are available for peaks in an energy spectrum. <b>Tallies</b> as a function of energy or other variables can be plotted in a variety of styles. Multiple <b>tallies</b> can be shown together, each with an optional independent scaling factor. A new <b>tally</b> can be defined from linear combination of two <b>tallies.</b> Data is imported from MCTAL files. A list shows available <b>tallies.</b> A sequence of <b>tallies</b> can be plotted in three dimensions...|$|R

June also saw a wave of controversy arrive involving Charlie Davies and deceiving match officials during the run of play, causing Davies to be fined by MLS. As the international transfer window neared, United made an unanticipated, blockbuster trade with their Atlantic Cup rivals, New York Red Bulls on 27 June. On the pitch, however, United failed to win any matches during the month, <b>tallying</b> three draws and a loss during the month.|$|E
5|$|The block {{voting system}} was used, with each peer casting as many votes {{as there were}} seats to be filled.

The Lord Clerk Register was responsible for <b>tallying</b> the votes. The return issued by the Lord Clerk Register was sufficient evidence to admit the representative peers to Parliament; however, unlike other peers, Scottish representatives did not receive writs of summons.|$|E
