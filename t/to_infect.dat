Distemper causes the deaths of many pups in the wild, though some specimens can survive infection. Tularemia, a bacterial disease, infects coyotes through their rodent and lagomorph prey, and can be deadly for pups.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The PfEMP 1 {{family of}} Plasmodium falciparum antigens {{play a key}} role in {{pathogenesis}} of severe malaria through their insertion into the surface of parasite infected erythrocytes, and adhesion to host cells. Previous studies have suggested that parasites expressing PfEMP 1 subclasses group A and DC 8, associated with severe malaria, may have a growth advantage in immunologically naïve individuals. However, this idea has not been tested in longitudinal studies. Methods Here we assessed expression of the var genes encoding PfEMP 1, in parasites sampled from volunteers with varying prior exposure to malaria, following experimental infection by sporozoites (PfSPZ). Using qPCR, we tested for associations between the expression of various var subgroups in surviving parasite populations from each volunteer and 1) the levels of participants’ antibodies <b>to</b> <b>infected</b> erythrocytes before challenge infection and 2) the apparent in vivo parasite multiplication rate. Results We show that 1) expression of var genes encoding for group A and DC 8 -like PfEMP 1 were associated with low levels of antibodies <b>to</b> <b>infected</b> erythrocytes (αIE) before challenge, and 2) expression of a DC 8 -like CIDRα 1. 1 domain was associated with higher apparent parasite multiplication rate in a manner that was independent of levels of prior antibodies <b>to</b> <b>infected</b> erythrocytes. Conclusions This study provides insight into the role of antibodies <b>to</b> <b>infected</b> erythrocytes surface antigens in the development of naturally acquired immunity and may help explain why specific PfEMP 1 variants may be associated with severe malaria.

Based on their hybridization specificities toward DNAs of leukemic tissues, these sequences were designated as follows: (i) “COM,” (ii) “LYM” or “MYE,” (iii) “UNI,” and (iv) “UND. ” The COM fraction represented sequences common {{to all of the}} viral genomes. The LYM fraction, which was isolated only from gibbon ape leukemia viruses associated with {{lymphocytic leukemia}}, represented genomic sequences associated with lymphocytic leukemia since the RNA hybridized at a 4 - to 15 -fold-higher rate <b>to</b> <b>infected</b> tissue DNA from lymphocytic leukemic gibbons than <b>to</b> <b>infected</b> tissue DNA from myelogenous leukemic gibbons.
