5|$|Before {{the late}} 1960s, fires were {{generally}} believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>detrimental</b> for parks and forests, and management policies {{were aimed at}} suppressing fires as quickly as possible. However, as the beneficial ecological role of fire became better understood in the decades before 1988, a policy was adopted of allowing natural fires to burn under controlled conditions, which proved highly successful in reducing the area lost annually to wildfires.|$|E

5|$|In 1913, {{representative}} William J. Hughes of Whatcom County {{proposed the}} formation of a commission to adopt the state flag, consisting of the Governor, Secretary of State, and Adjutant General. Governor Ernest Lister became a supporter of the idea, issuing a call for designs from the state's citizens and city organizations. The campaign for a state flag, however, was opposed by patriotic groups like the Sons of the American Revolution and Sons of Veterans, finding the use of a state flag <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>detrimental</b> to the national flag.|$|E
5|$|The ONA {{believe that}} there are {{historical}} precedents to their practice of human sacrifice, expressing belief in a prehistoric tradition in which humans were sacrificed to a goddess named Baphomet at the spring equinox and to the Arcturus star in the autumn. However, the ONA's advocacy of human sacrifice has drawn strong criticism from other Satanist groups like the Temple of Set, who deem it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>detrimental</b> to their own attempts to make Satanism more socially acceptable within Western nations.|$|E
5|$|The Land Estates Act of 1908 {{was passed}} by the Madras Government in order to protect {{cultivators}} in Zamindaris from exploitation. Under the act, ryots were made permanent occupants of the land. However, far from protecting the ryots, the legislation proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>detrimental</b> to the interests of the cultivators in the Oriya-speaking northern districts of the presidency who were the intended beneficiaries, as it tied the cultivator to his land and landlord with the chains of eternal serfdom. In 1933, an amendment to the Act was introduced by the Raja of Bobbili to curb the rights of Zamindars and safeguard the cultivators from exploitation. This act was passed in the legislative council despite strong opposition from the Zamindars.|$|E
30|$|The {{intensive}} monitoring {{that patients}} <b>are</b> subjected <b>to</b> <b>is</b> <b>detrimental</b> <b>to</b> the intrinsic sleep cycle, suggesting that {{under these conditions}} ICU patients will experience sleep deprivation. Further, in an observational study by Le et al. [88], nursing staff reported that 13.9 % of nocturnal interactions could be safely omitted and, in turn, reduce the disturbance to patients. This suggests {{that a number of}} nursing-based activities are performed as a routine rather than based on clinical evidence and necessity. This highlights the need for clinical staff to critically evaluate the necessity for some of the care provided and to consider making adjustments to workflow in order to promote nocturnal sleep.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Sjahrir {{continued}} to work on negotiations with the Allied forces. On 7October 1946, Sjahrir and the former Dutch Prime Minister, Wim Schermerhorn, agreed to work towards a ceasefire. The discussions were to be moderated by the British diplomat Lord Killearn and involved Sudirman. He took a specially commissioned train to Jakarta, departing on 20October. However, he ordered it to return to Yogyakarta when Dutch troops refused to allow him and his men to enter the city with their weapons, feeling that such an order violated his sense of honour; the Dutch apologised, construing the events as a misunderstanding. Sudirman took another train in late October, arriving at Gambir Station in Jakarta on 1November, where he was greeted by large crowds. The discussions in Jakarta resulted in the drafting of the Linggadjati Agreement on 15 November; the agreement was ratified on 25March 1947, despite heavy opposition from Indonesian nationalists. Sudirman was vocally against the agreement, which he found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>detrimental</b> to Indonesian interests, but considered himself obliged to follow his orders.|$|E

Unlike Hitler, he did not so much inspire antisemitism in them (none of these three were particularly anti-Semitic), but rather provided one important role model for their generally combative, unrelenting stance towards ideological political opponents, which ultimately proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>detrimental</b> to the cohesion of the Austrian state.|$|E

25|$|Haitian {{politics}} have been contentious: since independence, Haiti has suffered 32 coups. Haiti {{is the only}} country in the Western Hemisphere to undergo a successful slave revolution, but a long history of oppression by dictators—including François Duvalier and his son Jean-Claude Duvalier—has markedly affected the nation. France, the United States and other Western countries have repeatedly intervened in Haitian politics since the country's founding, sometimes at the request of one party or another. Along with international financial institutions, they have imposed large quantities of debt. Haiti has so much foreign debt that payments have rivaled the available government budget for social sector spending. There have been criticisms of financial institutions for enforcing trade policies on Haiti, which are considered by some <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>detrimental</b> to local industry.|$|E

Starting with 4-hydroxyindole, they generated psilocybin from psilocin in 85% yield, a marked improvement over yields reported from previous syntheses. Purified psilocybin is a white, needle-like crystalline powder with a melting point between , and a slightly ammonia-like taste.|$|R
25|$|Some {{controversy}} surrounded Pascarl {{soon after}} the abduction, as she successfully applied to the Australian Family Court to prevent the content of any interview with her children from appearing in the Australian media, the Courts deeming published interviews <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>detrimental</b> to the children and contrary to their future reintroduction into Australian society. The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd unsuccessfully appealed the decision. Ray Martin of 60 Minutes had travelled to Malaysia and interviewed the prince and his family there, and while footage of the children appeared on television, what was said by the children was not broadcast in Australia. Some criticism was levelled at Pascarl regarding how she, and her then husband, had dealt with the media, but she stated she felt justified in protecting the psychological welfare of her kidnapped children.|$|E
25|$|The Cape Dwarf Chameleon is {{currently}} experiencing habitat loss and fragmentation of its natural habitat through causes such as urbanization and agriculture. The historical habitat of Bradypodion pumilum has recently become severely fragmented due to intense urbanization and agricultural transformation. This trend is continuing with approximately 6.5 square kilometers of undeveloped land becoming lost to {{transformation in the}} Cape Town municipal area per year. Additional losses are expected to occur because of rapid climatic changes near Cape town {{which is where the}} species is primarily distributed. In urban areas, Cape Dwarf Chameleons are limited to planted vegetation, usually nonindigenous species, and patches of highly disturbed habitat. Populations are often found living in the overgrowth of exotic vegetation on road verges, abandoned urban ground, riverine thickets, or residential areas. Part of the species distribution lies in habitats that are protected by provincial parks, national parks, and private reserves. This protected area only amounts to 40% of the total area of occupancy. Most of the shrubland found in these protected areas are fire-prone, and natural fires are known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>detrimental</b> to dwarf chameleon populations.|$|E
25|$|Parliament {{passed the}} Industrial Coordination Act during the Second Malaysia Plan, which {{required}} all new manufacturing enterprises with M$100,000, or twenty-five or more workers, to be {{licensed by the}} Minister of Trade and Industry.

Malaysian Chinese manufacturers {{were concerned about the}} act, as they had operated with minimal control from the government before. Nevertheless, the government stated the act was not meant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>detrimental</b> towards any group, and went ahead with its implementation. Under the act, firms were divided into three categories: firms approved after 1 January 1972, firms approved before then, and firms operating without approval from the Ministry. All firms subject to the act were required to submit a proposal to the Ministry stating how they planned to achieve the long-term target of achieving 30% Malay and 70% non-Malay Malaysian ownership in the company. Proposals that were accepted then became the guidelines for how the relevant company would operate.|$|E
