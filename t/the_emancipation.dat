5|$|Copeland {{returned}} to her mother's home and frequent arguments. Her mother had long resented the Bradleys' influence and soon decided that Copeland would cease study with the Bradleys. Copeland was distraught with fear {{that she would not}} be able to dance. She had heard the term emancipation while in San Francisco; the procedure was common among young performers to secure their financial and residential independence. The Bradleys introduced Copeland to Steven Bartell, a lawyer who explained <b>the</b> <b>emancipation</b> petition process. The Bradleys encouraged her to be absent from home when <b>the</b> <b>emancipation</b> petition was delivered to her mother. Copeland ran away from home for three days and stayed with a friend, while Bartell filed <b>the</b> <b>emancipation</b> papers. After her mother reported Copeland missing, she was told about <b>the</b> <b>emancipation</b> petition. Three days after running away, Copeland was {{returned to}} her mother by the police. DelaCerna engaged lawyer Gloria Allred and applied for a series of restraining orders, which included the Bradleys' five-year-old son, who had been Copeland's roommate, and Bartell. The order was partly intended to preclude contact between the Bradleys and Copeland, but it did not have proper legal basis, since there had been no stalking and no harassment.|$|E
