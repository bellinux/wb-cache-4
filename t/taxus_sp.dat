40|$|Taxol, a diterpenoid {{natural product}} first {{isolated}} from Taxus brevifolia, {{is one of}} today's better known anticancer drugs. Despite its clinical efficacy, the difficulty of establishing a secure and cost-effective supply of taxol has limited its use. However, its unique mode of action and efficacy against multiple forms of cancer has ensured continual efforts to achieve total and semisynthesis, as well as biotechnological production methods. Total synthesis is now possible but inefficient, so the production of taxol and related taxoids remains completely dependent on biomass derived from <b>Taxus</b> <b>sp,</b> with cell suspensions and collected plant materials as sources. The key to improving the supply of taxol and other clinically useful taxoids is the detailed elucidation of the taxoid biosynthesis pathway, {{which has been the}} subject of intense research. Many genes and enzymes in the Taxus pathway for taxoid biosynthesis have now been identified, although gaps remain. In addition to <b>Taxus</b> <b>sp,</b> taxoids are also synthesized by various endophytic fungi, which often live in association with Taxus trees, thus raising questions about the evolutionary origin of this complex diterpenoid pathway. In the future, it may be possible to improve taxoid synthesis through the genetic modification of Taxus cell cultures, by culturing endophytic fungi or by transferring the entire pathway into a heterologous expression host, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae...|$|E
40|$|Taxus sumatrana (Miquel) de Laubenfels {{is known}} as an endanger forest tree species grown at Kerinci National Park in Jambi,Indonesia. This plant was known {{potential}} on producing taxol. Taxol is a bioactive compound, {{could be used as}} antibacterial agent and recently confirmed to cure cancer cells. For the first time in 1960, Arthur Barclay found the taxol compound from <b>Taxus</b> <b>sp.</b> (pacific yew). However to isolate the bioactive compound, huge amount of tree biomass is needed. Research on endophytes microbes which are isolated from inner tissue of <b>Taxus</b> <b>sp.</b> declared that those microbes have potential on producing antioxidant agent for drug discovery. Isolation and conservation of endophytes and selecting its potential is promising the novel of finding new drug that may be effective for treating the newly developing diseases in human. Fifteen isolates of Taxus endophytes have been successfully studied on their ability on producing antioxidant. The results showed that endophytes fungus isolates TsC- 17, isolated from Taxus sumatrana grown in Cibodas Botanical Gardens-LIPI, could produce extracellular bioactive compound which performed activity of suppressing free radical, is significantly better compared to intracellular bioactive compound eventhough it is not as high as in vitamin C. The activity of suppressing free radical resulted from bioactive compound of endophyte fungus isolates TsC- 17 was 20 % for intracellular bioactive compound, while it was 60 % for extracellular bioactive compound and 90 % for vitamin C...|$|E
40|$|The {{values of}} some morpho-anatomical {{features}} (the {{size and shape}} of the epidermic cells of the leaves, as well as the size and features of the stomata) recorded in some fossil vegetal species and their actual correspondent species were analysed. These differences offer information about the evolution process. In the case of the analysed species (Ginkgo sp., <b>Taxus</b> <b>sp.,</b> Magnolia sp. and Buxus sempervirens), two hypotheses concerning the genetic mechanisms involved in evolution and in the speciation processes or in the adaptation to the environmental conditions can be considered. These genetic mechanisms are: the multiplication of genomes and the process of gene amplification. They both result in an increase in epidermic cells and stomata size, {{as well as in the}} enzymatic activity, which determines a better adaptation to the environmental conditions, as well as to the settlement of the speciation process. ...|$|E

40|$|Docetaxel (DTX) is a semisynthetic taxoid, {{analogue}} of paclitaxel, {{derived from}} the European yew tree (<b>Taxus</b> bacata <b>sp.)</b> {{and is one of}} the most effective drugs in chemotherapy. It has proven to be useful against several types of cancers such as breast, ovarian, prostate, head and neck, gastric and non-small lung cancers. The oral bioavailability of DTX is hampered by their both high lipophilic character and low permeability related to their affinity for the P-glycoprotein and cytochrome P 450 enzymatic complex. In order to solve these problems and, thus, enhance the oral absorption of these drugs, one possible solution may be the encapsulation of these drugs into polymeric nanoparticles with both mucus-penetrating properties and inhibitory abilities of the efflux pump activity and cythocrome P 450 metabolism. In this way, in a first step, these nanoparticles would be capable to cross the mucus layer that covers the surface of the enterocytes and, thus, conduct the drug till the absorptive membrane. Once there, in a second step, the carriers would release the cargo and, in parallel, disturb the activity of enzymes and pumps involved in the presystemic metabolism of the loaded drug. The pegylation of nanoparticles from the copolymer of methyl vinyl ether and maleic anhydride (Gantrez® AN) yields submicronic carriers with these specific properties. In the present work, our aim was to explore the potential of these pegylated nanoparticles as delivery systems for docetaxel. 	In summary, pegylated nanoparticles provide an adequate device for the oral delivery of docetaxel. When orally administered, these nanoparticles offered prolonged and sustained plasma levels of the anticancer drug for 3 days. In addition, the relative oral bioavailability was calculated to be up 56 % and around 12 -times higher than for ¿naked¿ nanoparticles. Interestingly, the elimination and distribution of docetaxel in vivo from pegylated nanoparticles and intravenous Taxotere® was found to be similar, suggesting that these nanoparticles after reaching the surface of the enterocytes would remain within the gut and did not enter into the circulation. Finally, toxicity study revealed a reduced toxicity profile for nanoparticles orally administered compared to Taxotere®...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{cell-based}} bioprocessing—is {{to use the}} biosynthetic pathways {{of plant}} cells/tissues {{for the production of}} useful metabolites (large and small molecules) and biotransformation. Despite aworld-wide effort over 50 years, “potential” is still the most frequentword used to describe this technology as yet with very limited commercial success (Zhang and Curtin, 2002). To advance our knowledge and tools in translating “potential” into “commercial success”, the present presentation will discuss a newstrategy—a molecular bioprocessing approach focusing on the characterization and manipulation of post-biosynthetic pathways (compartmentation, transport, storage, catabolism/degradation and secretion, etc.) to improve the yield and productivity of plant secondarymetabolites (Conn, 2006). The presentation will use two case studies of resveratrol production by Vitis vinifera cell culture and taxane production by <b>Taxus</b> <b>sp.</b> cell culture to demonstrate the potential of this novel strategy (Zhang and Curtin, 2002; Conn, 2006; Zhang et al., 2002).

40|$|Paclitaxel is an {{effective}} antineoplastic agent originally extracted in low yield from the bark of Taxus breVifolia. Although it was generally considered a particular metabolite of <b>Taxus</b> <b>sp.,</b> paclitaxel was recently found in hazel cell cultures. The aim of the present work was to verify whether hazel differentiated tissues {{could be used as}} a commercial source of paclitaxel and other taxanes. Thus, shells and leaves of hazel plants were analyzed by ELISA and HPLC-MS. Both shell and leaf extracts contained taxanes. Among these, paclitaxel, 10 -deacetylbaccatin III, baccatin III, paclitaxel C, and 7 -epipaclitaxel were identified and quantified. Hazel extracts also showed biological activity, inhibiting metaphase to anaphase transition in a human tumor cell line. The level of total taxanes in leaves was higher than in shells collected in the same period from the same plants. However, the finding of these compounds in shells, which are considered discarded material and are mass produced by many food industries, is of interest for the future availability of paclitaxel and other antineoplastic compounds...|$|E

40|$|False spider mites (Acari: Tenuipalpidae) are {{flattened}} and red in color. They {{are distributed}} worldwide and considered as cosmopolitan pests. Some {{of the species}} are host specific, found on greenhouse plants {{as well as many}} other plants. Some of the tenuipalpids, such as Pentamerismus sp., have been found on coniferous host plants and forest trees such as Juniperus sp. and Thuja sp. Tenuipalpids puncture the epidermis of the host plants and suck out the juices with their needle-shaped mouth parts. Their damage causes leaves to turn brown and finally to wilt and die. This damage resembles that caused by spider mites. Although taxonomic characters are extensively used for the identification of tenuipalpids, their ultrastructure is not sufficiently well studied. False spider mite species were surveyed in recreational areas in Ankara, Turkey in 2008 and 2009. Thuja sp., Juniperus sp., and <b>Taxus</b> <b>sp.</b> were sampled and the mite species collected were identified using a light microscope. Their identification is difficult and will be discussed.

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} of the study Taxol {{is one of the most}} {{effective}} anticancer drugs that isolated from <b>Taxus</b> <b>sp.</b> due to the slow growth of Taxus trees and low concentration of Taxol in the tissues, the biotechnological approaches especially plant cell culture have been considered to produce Taxol in commercial scale. MethodsWe investigated the effects of basal medium type used in culture media on production of Taxol and other taxane compounds from cell suspension culture of T. baccata L. Briefly, five commonly basal media including Gamborg, Murashige and Skoog, Woody Plant, Schenk and Hildebrandt, and Driver and Kuniyuki medium were used for preparing separate suspension culture media. The intra- and extra-cellular yields of taxanes were analyzed by using HPLC after 21 days period of culturing. ResultsThe yields of taxanes were significantly different for the cultures prepared by different basal media. Moreover, the effects of basal medium on the yield of products differed for varius taxane compounds. Maximum yields of Baccatin III (10. 03 mgl- 1) and 10 -deacetyl baccatin III (4. 2 mgl- 1) were achieved from the DKW basal media, but the yield of Taxol was maximum (16. 58 mgl- 1) in the WPM basal media. Furthermore, the secretion of taxanes from the cells into medium was also considerably affected by the type of basal medium. The maximum extra-cellular yield of Taxol (7. 81 mgl- 1), Baccatin III (5. 0 mgl- 1), and 10 -deacetyl baccatin III (1. 45 mgl- 1) were also obtained by using DKW basal medium that were significantly higher than those obtained from other culture media...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Genes {{for plant}} {{nitric oxide synthase}} (NOS) now help explain how NO is {{produced}} from nitrate, nitrite, and/or L-arginine in the culture medium and in cells. Evidence is presented that under aseptic conditions; plant NOS activity, NO bursts, and cell death (apoptosis) are important factors in the recovery of taxol (paclitaxel) from cell suspensions of several <b>Taxus</b> <b>sp.</b> Cell-suspension responses to mechanical stresses, simulated microgravity, and hypergravity were dominated by NO bursts and cell death (apoptosis) and by the overproduction and release of free and bound taxol into the culture medium. The synthesis of the taxane ring in the chloroplasts and gravisensing amyloplasts, and the subsequent assembly of taxol and related taxane diterpenoids were visualized by immunocytochemical, laser confocal and scanning electron microscopy. Drug-producing cells and taxane-bearing materials in the culture medium were recovered using immunoparamagnetic beads. Bound taxol and taxanes were recovered from xylanase hydrolyates. Binding {{was associated with the}} expression of two proteins for ‘touch ’ genes expressed under mechanical forces. Taxol recovery was increased by 64 % by the use of a NO donor. NOS inhibition with guandino compounds, and the use of a NO trap, reduced taxol recovery and reduced taxane diterpenoid biosynthesis. This offered countermeasures to NO-mediated stress, and reduced apoptosis. In hypergravity, the taxol and taxanes released from cells by syneresis were recovered on hydrophobic PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) filters. Cyclodextrins added to the culture medium enhanced biomass yield and altered the solubility of taxanes to improve the recovery of taxol and taxanes...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between reproductive performance and preference for potential host plants of the vine weevil is investigated, {{as shown in}} tests on contact (or feeding) preference, presented herein, and tests on olfactory preference, published elsewhere. Assessment of reproductive performance shows that the host-plant range of the adult vine weevil Otiorhynchus sulcatus in Europe is limited to one gymnosperm genus (<b>Taxus</b> <b>sp.)</b> and {{a broad range of}} angiosperm plants in two subclasses of the Dicotyledonae, namely Dilleniidae and Rosidae. The successful reproduction on very distantly related plant taxa suggests that the original weevil- and plant-habitat has mediated the current host-plant range of the vine weevil. Contact-preference tests with equally suitable hosts, such as Aronia, Fragaria, Euonymus and Taxus, and one less suitable host, Humulus, indicate a mismatch between contact preference and performance and, as far as olfactory preferences are known, these match neither the contact preferences nor the performance. This mismatch may arise because (i) host plant species offered do not occur in weevil habitat in Europe (e. g. Aronia and the cultivated Fragaria come from North America) and (ii) predation (or disease) risks differ among host plants, thereby altering effective reproductive performance. With respect to performance on novel hosts (Thuja, Prunus) and bad hosts (Rhododendron), some between-individual variation is found within a single population, suggesting that local populations harbour (possibly genetic) variation for adaptation to new hosts. How this variation is maintained in the face of strong selection pressures on local populations of flightless and thelytokous weevils, is an important question for understanding the broad host plant range in the vine weevil...|$|E

40|$|For the {{production}} of taxol (paclitaxel) by immobilized cells cultured in a bioreactor, cells prepared from Taxus cuspidata var. nana were entrapped with calcium alginate {{and the amount of}} paclitaxel released into F 4 G 4 liquid medium was investigated. Immobilized cell cultures were developed using various calcium alginate gel concentrations (2, 2. 5 and 4 % w/v) and cell concentrations (3, 5 and 10 % w/v). Some of the paclitaxel produced in the immobilized cells was found to be released into F 4 G 4 liquid medium. The amount released depended on the gel and cell concentrations used. The free cells in suspension cultures accumulated paclitaxel in intracellular compartments, while the cells immobilized with the calcium alginate gel released some paclitaxel into the medium. The gel forced some of the paclitaxel produced in the cells to be released into the medium. When the cultures using immobilized cells entrapped at a 3 % cell concentration and 2. 5 % gel concentration with an air-lift bioreactor were conducted for 30 days, the amount of paclitaxel released into the medium increased with time on the addition of an elicitor, chito-heptaose.
