5|$|The {{depression}} continued west-northwestward, passing {{north of}} the Leeward Islands, before drifting northwestward. It once again attained tropical storm status on September 28, while situated well {{to the east of}} the Bahamas. Inga continued to intensify, and achieved hurricane status at 0000 UTC on September 30, at which point it turned northeastward. The storm <b>then</b> <b>abruptly,</b> yet gradually, turned towards the south, and ultimately completed a counter-clockwise loop as it bent back westward. Steering currents were weak, and the hurricane continued to proceed slowly. Late on October 3, it turned to the northwest, still as a Category 1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm then curved northeastward and intensified to Category 2 status at 0000 UTC on October 5.|$|E
5|$|Michael and Dwight {{meet with}} Jan, {{who is now}} a fairly {{successful}} office manager for a hospital and single mother. After Jan gives Michael a brutal description of why their relationship failed and he watches her play with her daughter Astrid, Michael reveals that he has herpes. He meets with Helene, Pam's mother, who is playing with CeCe at a playground; after an awkward conversation in which she also points out his skewed memory, he insults her and walks off. He meets with Carol while she is conducting an open house. Carol attempts to be polite, but <b>then</b> <b>abruptly</b> points out his faults too. Finally, Michael calls Holly one last time, only to get her voicemail. He leaves her a heartfelt message that what she said hurt him and that when he saw all his other exes, he had not been happy to see any of them, but when he talked to her, he was happy. He says that does not understand why she wants to downplay what they had, but he remembers their relationship perfectly and considers it special. Before hanging up, he awkwardly adds that she should be tested for herpes.|$|E
5|$|On 30December, the JTWC {{reported}} that Rewa had become {{equivalent to a}} category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale (SSHS); early {{the next day the}} BoM {{reported that}} the system had developed into a category 3severe tropical cyclone, and an eye became visible on satellite imagery. The system <b>then</b> <b>abruptly</b> turned and started to move towards the south parallel to the Queensland coast because of an interaction with an upper-level trough of low pressure. On 2January both the JTWC and the BoM reported that Rewa had reached its peak intensity, with the JTWC reporting that Rewa had peaked with 1-minute windspeeds of 230km/h (145mph), equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on the SSHWS. Meanwhile, the BoM reported that the system had peaked with 10-minute windspeeds of 205km/h (125mph) with a central pressure of , which made it a category 5severe tropical cyclone on the Australian Scale. Rewa remained at its peak intensity for 24hours before the system started to weaken during 3January, as strengthening upper level north-westerlies increased vertical wind shear over the system. Throughout that day, the cyclone started to move towards the south-east, before it started to take a more eastwards track as it approached 160°E.|$|E

25|$|The 2003 film Tropical Malady, {{directed}} by Apichatpong Weerasethakul, depicts a romance between a Thai army soldier {{and a local}} small-town boy. The narrative of the film <b>then</b> <b>abruptly</b> shifts in the middle to relate a folk tale about a tiger shaman, with the soldier alone in the jungle, haunted by the tiger-shaman's spirit. The film won a jury prize at the Cannes Film Festival.|$|E
25|$|In 1690, {{the leading}} {{inhabitants}} petitioned William III and Mary for Croydon to be incorporated as a borough. The application was initially approved, the King authorising {{the drafting of}} a charter, but the process was <b>then</b> <b>abruptly</b> halted, apparently through the intervention of Archbishop John Tillotson, who probably feared a threat to his own authority over the town. The application was revived the following year, when Queen Mary again authorised a charter, but once again it was abandoned. A second petition in 1707 was effectively ignored.|$|E

25|$|Late on December 24, {{the winter}} storm began {{absorbing}} an ample amount of Gulf stream energy; as a result, {{the storm was}} able to reorganize. The core of the storm eventually moved southeast into the Gulf of Mexico <b>then</b> <b>abruptly</b> turned sharply northeastward into the Florida panhandle and state of Georgia as it merged with an upper-level low pressure system located near Virginia. As it became a stacked low pressure system, the storm system began a period of rapid intensification off the North Carolina coast while tracking {{along the coast of}} the Northeast and Newfoundland.|$|E
25|$|Cave 24 is like Cave 21, {{unfinished}} {{but much}} larger. It features {{the second largest}} monastery hall (29.3 X 29.3 m) after Cave 4. The cave 24 monastery has been important to scholarly studies of the site because it shows how multiple crews of workers completed their objectives in parallel. The cell construction began {{as soon as the}} aisle had been excavated and while the main hall and sanctum were under construction. The construction of Cave 24 was planned in 467 CE, but likely started in 475 CE, with support from Buddhabhadra, <b>then</b> <b>abruptly</b> ended in 477 with the sponsor king Harisena's death.|$|E
25|$|By then, the {{aircraft}} had insufficient speed to abort the landing. Aware that {{the aircraft}} most likely would overrun, the commander opted to not steer {{it off the}} left {{where there was a}} steep descent, or to the right where there were rocks. As a last resort, the commander attempted to reduce speed by skidding the aircraft by first steering it right, and <b>then</b> <b>abruptly</b> to the left. The aircraft overran the runway at 22.8 seconds after touchdown, at 07:32:37. At the same time, the crash alarm was activated by AFIS. The aircraft slid off the runway at about a forty-five degree angle, roughly north-west.|$|E

The Roman historian, Curtius, states that Meleager broke out into violent invectives against the ambition of Perdiccas and <b>then</b> <b>abruptly</b> quit the assembly in order to encourage the soldiery to express their opposition against Perdiccas. The Greek historian, Diodorus, states that Meleager was sent by the assembled generals to appease the clamours and discontent of the troops, but instead of doing so, he joined the mutineers.|$|E
25|$|The stanza {{begins with}} a celebration of divine power, and <b>then</b> <b>abruptly</b> shifts to a darker, more allusive train of thought, {{featuring}} condemnation of a renowned poet, Archilochus, Grown fat on the harsh words of hate. Archilochus was an iambic poet, working within a genre that licensed abusive and scurrilous versea regrettable tendency {{from the viewpoint of}} Pindar, whose own persona is intensely earnest, preaching to Hieron the need for moderation (wealth with wisdom) and submission to the divine will. The reference to the embittered poet appears to be Pindar's meditative response to some intrigues at Hieron's court, possibly by his rivals, condemned elsewhere as a pair of ravens (Olympian 2). The intensity of the stanza suggests that it is the culmination and climax of the poem. In fact, the stanza occupies the middle of Pythian 2 and the intensity is sustained throughout the poem from beginning to end. It is the sustained intensity of his poetry that Quintilian refers to above as a rolling flood of eloquence and Horace below refers to as the uncontrollable momentum of a river that has burst its banks. Longinus likens him to a vast fire and Athenaeus refers to him as the great-voiced Pindar.|$|E

Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B- and a more mixed review, writing that the episode was [...] "Not one for the ages, despite some jarring moments (car meets tree, Scully's hoodoo hallucinations, and that final shot — whoa)." [...] Reviewer Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C, and wrote that [...] "the biggest {{problems}} here are the lack of focus and the chaotic pacing. The episode rumbles along in first gear for about three-quarters of its running time and <b>then</b> <b>abruptly</b> shifts into high gear at the end, moving toward an apocalyptic finish that doesn't feel wholly earned.

500|$|Although several storms caused minimal effects, several {{tropical}} cyclones {{also left}} extensive impact. Hurricane Gloria, the strongest storm of the season, resulted in 14fatalities and about $900million (1985USD) in damage in North Carolina, Virginia, the Mid-Atlantic, and New England. Hurricane Elena threatened the central Gulf Coast of the United States, <b>then</b> <b>abruptly</b> re-curved toward Florida. Unexpectedly, Elena doubled-back and struck Mississippi, resulting in two mass evacuations. The storm caused $1.3billion in losses, {{with most of}} the damage in Louisiana and Mississippi. Similarly, Hurricane Juan caused $1.5billion in damage due to its erratic track offshore and across Louisiana. Three other tropical cyclones [...] Hurricanes Bob, Danny, and Kate [...] caused moderate to extensive damage in Cuba and the United States.

[...] A week later Howe tried to spring a trap on one of Washington's detachments that would have cut the American retreat into the hills off; this effort was repulsed in the Battle of Short Hills. [...] After this failure, Howe embarked his army on transports and set sail for Chesapeake Bay, intending to take Philadelphia from the south.|$|E
500|$|In February 1943, John Slessor {{took over}} as AOC. During this time, a debate was {{taking place in the}} RAF over how best to attack U-boats and sink them in large numbers. Arthur Harris, AOC Bomber Command, and the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), were in favour of {{knocking}} out their bases and attacking submarine construction yards. Partly this was a mark of the AOCs in the air forces, particularly Harris, who hated using 'his' bombers in what he considered to be [...] "defensive" [...] roles. Slessor agreed with the need to take the war to the U-boats. He preferred attacking the German vessels in the Bay of Biscay, in transit to the Atlantic. His operational tool was Air-Vice Marshal G.R Bromet's No. 19 Group. The offensive became collectively known as [...] "The Second Bay Offensive". Operation Gondola, lasting from 4–16 February. This operation included two B-24 squadrons with SCR 517 (ASV III) radar. A total of 300 sorties were managed, 19 sightings and 8 attacks were made. Only one U-boat (...) was sunk by No. 2 Squadron. The US units were <b>then</b> <b>abruptly</b> moved to the Moroccan Sea Frontier, despite the protests of Slessor.|$|E
500|$|Travis Fickett of IGN {{said that}} the episode was [...] "still satisfying, even when it's {{not one of the}} show's funnier episodes", but [...] "it's a bit of a shame this episode wasn't a home run, because having Dwight and Michael hit the clubs is a funny idea." [...] Fickett went on to praise the episode's awkward moment between Toby and Pam, when Toby placed his hand on Pam's leg, and Toby's {{subsequent}} escape by hopping the fence. Fickett stated that, for Toby's growing love of Pam, and growing jealousy of Jim, [...] "this is pretty great pay off". Claire Zulkey, a writer for the Los Angeles Times, was not as pleased with the episode. Zulkey wrote [...] "that when it's at its zaniest, The Office is at its worst", and the episode was [...] "just too silly to be funny". Zulkey did say that [...] "it was hilarious to see him [...] let his hand more-than-linger on her knee and <b>then</b> <b>abruptly</b> flee the premises by jumping over the fence and running home."
