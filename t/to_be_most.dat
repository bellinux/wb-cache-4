While Dortmund {{went on to win the}} Bundesliga title in the 1995–96 season, Berger was frequently used as a substitute, making 12 of his 25 league appearances from the bench. Hitzfeld preferred to employ Berger as a defensive midfielder as he considered him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> suited to the role.|$|E
5|$|Also {{during the}} 1970s, Bill Morris was {{studying}} giant lambeosaurine remains from Baja California. He named them ?L. laticaudus in 1981 (type specimen LACM 17715). Morris used {{a question mark}} in his work because no complete crest had been found for his species, and without it a definitive assignment could not be made. From what was known of the skull, he considered it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> like Lambeosaurus. He interpreted this species as water-bound, due to features like its size, its tall and narrow tail (interpreted as a swimming adaptation), and weak hip articulations, {{as well as a}} healed broken thigh bone that he thought would have been too much of a handicap for a terrestrial animal to have survived long enough to heal. This species was later (2012) assigned to the new genus Magnapaulia.|$|E
5|$|Boletus luridus is {{the type}} species of Boletus section Luridi, {{originally}} circumscribed by Fries in 1838. This section includes species producing medium to large fruit bodies with thick, swollen stems, and minute pores that are coloured red, orange, or brown. However, the genus {{as a whole is}} strongly paraphyletic and has been partly fragmented as further studies have resolved relationships to a finer detail. Manfred Binder and David Hibbett showed B.luridus <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> closely related to a group containing B.torosus and B.luteocupreus, with B.vermiculosus and Pulveroboletus ravenelii as more distant relatives, based on molecular phylogenetics inferred from ribosomal DNA sequences. In a separate molecular study of ten frequently eaten European boletes, B.luridus clustered together with B.rhodoxanthus. Genetic analysis published in 2013 shows that B. luridus and many (but not all) red-pored boletes are part of a dupainii clade (named for Boletus dupainii), well-removed from the core group of Boletus edulis and relatives within the Boletineae. For this reason, it is now considered a species of Suillellus.|$|E

5|$|By 1912, Sadler and his wife, both doctors by then, {{operated}} a joint practice in Chicago that catered to children's and women's health issues. Sadler initially focused on surgery, performing surgeries with his wife, but widened his practice to include psychiatric counseling in 1930 {{and became a}} consulting psychiatrist at Columbus Hospital. As a psychiatrist, Sadler advocated {{an eclectic mix of}} techniques, applying the theories of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Alfred Adler, and Adolf Meyer. Sadler believed that religious faith was beneficial to mental health, and specifically promoted prayer, which he believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> effective in the context of Christian faith. However, he thought that religious beliefs were deleterious to mental health if based on fear.|$|E
5|$|Collected and {{described}} by Robert Brown {{in the early}} 19th century, Banksia coccinea appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> closely related to Banksia speciosa and B.baxteri. Banksia coccinea plants are killed by bushfire, and regenerate from seed. The flowers attract nectar- and insect-feeding birds, particularly honeyeaters, {{and a variety of}} insects. Widely {{considered one of the most}} attractive Banksia species, B.coccinea is a popular garden plant and one of the most important Banksia species for the cut flower industry; it is grown commercially in several countries including Australia, South Africa, Canada, the United States, New Zealand and Israel. In cultivation, B.coccinea grows well in a sunny location on well-drained soil, but it cannot survive in areas with humid or wet summers.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Oldfield Thomas of the British Museum of Natural History (BMNH) in London {{published}} the first description of Mindomys hammondi, using two specimens collected at Mindo in Pichincha Province, Ecuador, in 1913 by Gilbert Hammond. He named the species Nectomys hammondi, classifying {{it in the}} genus Nectomys, {{which at the time}} included not only the large water rats currently placed in it, but also Sigmodontomys alfari and Oryzomys dimidiatus. He considered the animal <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> closely related to Nectomys russulus, a species he had himself described in 1897 and which is now recognized as a synonym of Sigmodontomys alfari.|$|E

Relationships are unclear and it is uncertain into which direction the group radiated (into rainforest or into arid Australia).|$|E
5|$|In his 1918 {{revision}} of North American Oryzomys, Goldman considered O.nelsoni <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> {{closely related to}} the nearest mainland subspecies of O.couesi, O.couesi mexicanus. In 2009, Michael Carleton and Joaquin Arroyo-Cabrales revised the Oryzomys of western Mexico and confirmed that O.nelsoni is a very distinct species. Their morphometrical analysis found some resemblance between the species and Oryzomys albiventer of interior mainland Mexico, and they suggested that although O.nelsoni likely represents an old, distinctive lineage, it may have derived from a common ancestor with O.albiventer.|$|E

5|$|Keli was {{the second}} of three {{tropical}} cyclones to affect Tonga during a ten-month period, with Cyclones Hina and Ron affecting the island nation during March 1997 and January 1998. Ahead of the system impacting Tonga, the FMS issued cyclone warnings for the Niuas and strong wind warnings {{for the rest of}} Tonga. As a result of the warnings a vessel that was heading to the island group had to be recalled, which was predicted to affect supplies on the islands when it was likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> needed. During June 13, Keli caused some damage to the islands with plantations, breadfruit trees and other large trees devastated. The strong winds also destroyed several residences while causing damage to public buildings.|$|E
5|$|Killed by bushfire, Grevillea juniperina regenerates {{afterwards}} by {{seeds that}} germinate after lying dormant in the soil, stimulated {{by exposure to}} heat and smoke. Plants over 1m (3ft) high produce more seed. Intervals of 10 to 15 years between fires are thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> beneficial for the species' survival, as this allows seed numbers to build up in the soil over time. Grevillea juniperina can also colonise disturbed areas, though overgrowth of Bursaria spinosa can negatively impact its spread.|$|E
