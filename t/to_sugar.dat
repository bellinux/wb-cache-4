5|$|A typical 100-g parsnip {{contains}} 75 Calories (230 kJ) of energy. Most parsnip cultivars {{consist of}} about 80% water, 5% sugar, 1% protein, 0.3% fat, and 5% dietary fiber. The parsnip {{is rich in}} vitamins and minerals, and is particularly rich in potassium with 375mg per 100g. Several of the B-group vitamins are present, but levels of vitamin C are reduced in cooking. Since most of the vitamins and minerals are found close to the skin, many will be lost unless the root is finely peeled or cooked whole. During frosty weather, part of the starch is converted <b>to</b> <b>sugar</b> and the root tastes sweeter.|$|E
5|$|Before the Revolution, New Englanders {{consumed}} {{large quantities}} of rum and beer as maritime trade provided relatively {{easy access to the}} goods needed to produce these items. Rum was the distilled spirit of choice as molasses, the main ingredient, was readily available from trade with the West Indies. In the continent's interior, colonists drank whiskey, as they had ready access to corn and rye but did not have good access <b>to</b> <b>sugar</b> cane. However, up until the Revolution, many colonists considered whiskey to be a coarse beverage unfit for human consumption, believing that it caused the poor to become raucous and disorderly.|$|E
5|$|Cicadas are not major {{agricultural}} pests {{but in some}} outbreak years, trees may be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of females laying their eggs in the shoots. Small trees may wilt and larger trees may lose small branches. Although in general, the feeding activities of the nymphs do little damage, during the year before an outbreak of periodic cicadas, the large nymphs feed heavily and plant growth may suffer. Some species have turned from wild grasses <b>to</b> <b>sugar</b> cane, and this has affected the crop adversely, {{and in a few}} isolated cases, females have oviposited on food crops such as date palms, grape vines, citrus trees, asparagus and cotton.|$|E

40|$|Lipid/polymer {{membranes}} were modified with a phenolic compound, gallic acid, {{to obtain}} a high sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>sugars,</b> such as sucrose, glucose and fructose. Electric responses <b>to</b> <b>sugars</b> were measured with surface-modified membranes composed of tetradodecylammonium bromide, di-n-octylphenylphosphonate and polyvinyl chloride. The spectroscopic properties of gallic acid in an aqueous solution and {{in the presence of}} amphiphilic molecules in a buffer solution were studied. The obtained results show that the change in the absorption spectrum of gallic acid is pH- and time-dependent, and is susceptible to electric responses <b>to</b> <b>sugars...</b>|$|R

5|$|East of US285, {{the route}} enters {{the town of}} Center, where it skirts {{the south side of}} town as 8th Street. Here, it meets a {{railroad}} that connects the town <b>to</b> <b>Sugar</b> Junction farther south. The route moves east through farmland, where it meets County Road 100, which continues south to SH15. It then skirts along the county line all the way east to SH17 at the north side of Hooper.|$|E
5|$|In 17th-century Germany, the {{physician}} Eberhard Gockel discovered lead-contaminated wine {{to be the}} cause of an epidemic of colic. He had noticed that monks who did not drink wine were healthy, while wine drinkers developed colic, and traced the cause <b>to</b> <b>sugar</b> of lead, made by simmering litharge with vinegar. As a result, Eberhard Ludwig, Duke of Württemberg issued an edict in 1696 banning the adulteration of wines with litharge.|$|E
5|$|Maple syrup is a syrup {{usually made}} from the xylem sap of sugar maple, red maple, or black maple trees, {{although}} {{it can also be}} made from other maple species. In cold climates, these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before the winter; the starch is then converted <b>to</b> <b>sugar</b> that rises in the sap in late winter and early spring. Maple trees are tapped by drilling holes into their trunks and collecting the exuded sap, which is processed by heating to evaporate much of the water, leaving the concentrated syrup.|$|E
50|$|Digoxigenin (DIG) is a steroid found {{exclusively}} in the flowers and leaves of the plants Digitalis purpurea, Digitalis orientalis and Digitalis lanata (foxgloves), where it is attached <b>to</b> <b>sugars,</b> <b>to</b> form the glycosides (e.g. Lanatoside C).|$|R

5|$|Lt. Blue and Parrish {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>Sugar</b> Hollow where Parsons was awaiting them, and Parsons {{set about}} locating pine {{from which to}} make torches to light {{their way out of}} the hollow. Parsons carried with him a small hatchet, and began splitting pine in the darkness to fashion a torch. He accidentally struck himself in the knee with his hatchet, and Blue applied a handkerchief to his wound to stop its bleeding. The three men traveled through the dark and rain to the nearby home of Frank Carter, where they ate and dried their clothes by the fire. The following morning, they mounted their horses and traveled to Rev. Harris' home, where Parsons and Blue parted with Parrish. Parsons and Blue continued east over Town Hill and reached George Thompson's residence on the Little Cacapon River, which had risen due to the previous night's rainfall. They remained with Thompson for two days until the river subsided, then traveled to Blue's Gap, where they set up camp. There, Lt. Blue received orders from Col. Angus William McDonald to carry out an expedition for General Stonewall Jackson to ascertain the number of Union Army infantry, cavalry, and artillery present in and around Romney; he was accompanied on this expedition by Col. Parsons' son, Isaac Parsons, Jr., and by W. V. Parsons.|$|E

25|$|Ethanol is {{produced}} by microbial fermentation of the sugar. Microbial fermentation currently only works directly with sugars. Two major components of plants, starch and cellulose, are both made of sugars—and can, in principle, be converted <b>to</b> <b>sugars</b> for fermentation. Currently, only the sugar (e.g., sugar cane) and starch (e.g., corn) portions can be economically converted. There is much activity {{in the area of}} cellulosic ethanol, where the cellulose part of a plant is broken down <b>to</b> <b>sugars</b> and subsequently converted to ethanol.|$|R
30|$|The biocatalytic {{conversion}} of sugars from biomass-derived waste offers a promising route for the biotechnological production of fuels, chemicals and materials (Andberg et al. 2012). Next <b>to</b> <b>sugars</b> also sugar derivatives constitute an important building block of natural fibers {{and are therefore}} readily available.|$|R

50|$|As an {{adaptive}} consequence of pest control by poisoned sugar baits, {{a strain of}} German cockroaches has emerged that reacts to glucose as distastefully bitter. They refuse to eat sweetened baits, which presents an obstacle to their control, given that baits are an economical and effective means of control. It also is a dramatic illustration of adaptive selection; {{in the absence of}} poisoned sweet baits, attraction <b>to</b> <b>sugars</b> strongly promotes growth, energy, and reproduction; cockroaches that are not attracted <b>to</b> <b>sugars</b> take longer <b>to</b> grow and reproduce, whereas in the presence of poisoned sugared baits, sugar avoidance promotes reproduction.|$|R

40|$|We {{report that}} in Escherichia coli, {{chemotaxis}} <b>to</b> <b>sugars</b> transported by the phosphotransferase system is mediated by adenylate cyclase, the nucleotide cyclase {{linked to the}} phosphotransferase system. We conclude that adenylate cyclase is required in this chemotaxis pathway because mutations in the cyclase gene (cya) eliminate or impair the response <b>to</b> phosphotransferase system <b>sugars,</b> even though other components of the phosphotransferase system known to be required {{for the detection of}} these sugars are relatively unaffected by such mutations. Moreover, merely supplying the mutant bacteria with the products of this enzyme, cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP, does not restore the chemotactic response. Because a residual chemotactic response is observed in certain strains with residual cyclic GMP synthesis but no cyclic AMP synthesis, it appears that the guanylate cyclase activity rather than the adenylate cyclase activity of the enzyme may be required for chemotaxis <b>to</b> <b>sugars</b> transported by the phosphotransferase system. Mutations in the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase gene, which increase the level of both cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP, also reduce chemotaxis <b>to</b> these <b>sugars.</b> Therefore, it appears that control of the level of a cyclic nucleotide is critical for the chemotactic response <b>to</b> phosphotransferase system <b>sugars...</b>|$|R
