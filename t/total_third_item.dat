If the average SNR level of current speech signals is above zero, then the {{short-term}} SNRs around the speech endpoints are usually much lower than those between the endpoints.

5000|$|In Indian {{philosophical}} writings, {{the traditional}} structure of presenting a system {{consisted of three}} things: uddesa (listing of items to be discussed), laksana (defining each item in the list) and pariksa (critically examining whether the definitions apply properly to the items defined). The Tarka-Sangraha follows this model except for the <b>third</b> <b>item</b> of pariksa. The text presents the ontology, logic and epistemology of the Nyaya-Vaiseshika system.|$|R

Thus two shades of blue, {{to be perceived as}} similar must be contrasted with something differing greatly in hue from both—e.g., a shade of red.|$|R

30|$|The {{relationship}} is equal. WFJ is a developer, a businessman. We {{are not in}} an affiliated relationship. It is between a relocator and the relocatees. We are the two parties in this specific case. The <b>third</b> <b>item</b> of “the Civil Law” clearly stipulates that parties shall have equal status in a civil activity. The sixth item in it also mentions that civil activities must comply with relevant laws, regulations, and national policies.|$|R

The <b>third</b> <b>item,</b> in order to be allowed, would have to begin with the letter [...] "E".|$|R
