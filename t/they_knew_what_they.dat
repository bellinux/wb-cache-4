5|$|Lombard {{was eager}} to win an Academy Award, and {{selected}} her next project—from several possible scripts—with the expectation that it would bring her the trophy. Vigil in the Night (1940), directed by George Stevens, featured Lombard as a nurse who faces a series of personal difficulties. Although the performance was praised, she did not get her nomination, as the sombre mood of the picture turned audiences away and box-office returns were poor. Despite the realization that she was best suited to comedies, Lombard completed one more drama: <b>They</b> <b>Knew</b> <b>What</b> <b>They</b> Wanted (1940), co-starring Charles Laughton, which was mildly successful.|$|E

He also joined the Group Theatre, where he began acting in many plays and was introduced to a young Elia Kazan, who later worked with him on A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) and On the Waterfront (1954).|$|E

500|$|Through a {{collaboration}} with science consultant André Bormanis, the producers established the Phage as a bacteriophage. During a behind-the-scenes feature {{included on the}} DVD release of the show's second season, Bromanis explained that the writers and producers paid close attention to imagining a virus that could believably almost exterminate an entire species. Both Piller and Braga responded positively to Taylor's concept of the Vidiians. Piller viewed the idea of [...] "an alien culture who are a civilized people who are forced to do uncivilized things in order to survive" [...] as a compelling plot point. Braga agreed with Piller's assessment, saying: [...] "Very rarely do you stumble on something that has real resonance." [...] Freelance writer Skye Dent, who had helped with the original development of the Vidiians, felt that pride characterized the alien species. She explained: [...] "ven though <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were doing was wrong {{in terms of the}} actual action, they were very confident that because they were culturally superior, they were totally justified in killing people and taking their organs".|$|E
500|$|A {{low quality}} snippet of [...] "Frozen" [...] was leaked by fans on January 23, 1998, after it debuted on radio in Singapore, and posted {{it on the}} Internet. They said <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were doing was wrong, but that they hoped it would simply {{generate}} interest from Madonna. The song was played on the US radios, including the WKTU New York radio. Warner Bros. Records enlisted the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)'s Anti-Piracy Unit to delete the Internet downloads of the song. Erik Bradley, musical director of Chicago B96, classified [...] "Frozen" [...] as a [...] "the mark of a smash. Clearly, American pop radio needs Madonna", after he played the track on his station. According to Jon Uren, marketing director of Warner Music Europe, the song also had [...] "fantastic" [...] early support across Europe. Shortly after the song leaked, a remix version of [...] "Frozen" [...] was broadcast by the BBC website, and also was previewed on the soundtrack at the 1998 Versace fashion spring parade. The single was released commercially on February 23, 1998 in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Pearl Jam {{promoted}} the album with tours in Oceania and North America in 1998. Both {{were met with}} financial success, and the Australian shows in Melbourne sold out in just 17 minutes. After finishing the Australian concerts, Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring. Pearl Jam's sound engineer Brett Eliason stated, [...] "We went and did Hawaii and Australia with Jack. When we came back, Jack wasn't {{in a position to}} carry on. He made that decision more or less by himself. He can be a really great drummer but he had difficulty on tour putting out the energy for the length of shows they were doing. I don't know if he thought they'd put things on hold for him." [...] He was replaced on an initially temporary basis with former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron. Cameron said, [...] "I got a phone call out of the blue, from Mr. Ed Ved, Stoney and Kelly. I was ambushed. It was really short notice. He called and said 'hey what are you doing this summer?'" [...] Cameron learned over 80 songs in two weeks. [...] Regarding his entrance, Cameron stated that [...] "The guys made me feel real welcome and it wasn't a struggle to get it musically, but my style was a little bit different, I think, than what they were used to. And they've been through so many different drummers, I don't even know if <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted. So, I just kind of played the way I played and then eventually we kind of figured out what worked best for the band." ...|$|E

He played a Victorian butler in Forever and a Day (1943) and an Australian bar-owner in The Man from Down Under (1943). Simon Callow's 1987 biography quotes a number of contemporary reviews of Laughton's performances in these films. James Agate, reviewing Forever and a Day, wrote: [...] "Is there no-one at RKO to tell Charles Laughton when he is being plain bad?" [...] On the other hand, Bosley Crowther of the New York Times declared that Forever and a Day boasted [...] "superb performances".|$|E
