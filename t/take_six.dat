5|$|According to Congressman Jim Himes' website, the {{demolition}} funding was appropriated in 2009 {{and consisted of}} more than $2 million through federal funding. The money was funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the Comprehensive Appropriations Act of 2009, and a Community Development Block Grant. According to the Connecticut Post, the State of Connecticut funded $1.2 million for {{the demolition}} of the bridge, and {{the first phase of}} the project was expected to cost $500,000. The contract for the demolition of the bridge was given to S Corporation and the first task was to remove the eastern portion of the bridge. The entire process was expected to <b>take</b> <b>six</b> weeks to demolish the bridge. It was estimated that another $450,000 would be needed to remove the bridge's concrete counter-weights and $8 million to remove the approaches. In 2010, the Drawbridge Operation Regulation; Pequonnock River, Bridgeport, CT struck the rule pertaining to the operation of the bridge due to its removal.|$|E
5|$|P. lanceolata shrubs {{destroyed}} by bushfire regenerate through seedlings surviving through seedbank in the soil. The Ku-ring-gai Chase {{study found that}} seedlings germinated within two years of a 1994 bushfire, although some appeared up to six years afterwards, while germination {{was not related to}} any particular season. Plants <b>take</b> <b>six</b> years to reach maturity. Thus, more frequent bushfires prevent recruitment and hence endanger populations. However, plants in Lane Cove National Park were recorded maturing three years after an especially intense bushfire. What triggers germination is unknown, and seedlings have also arisen from areas disturbed by sand mining, sometimes growing in higher concentrations than before the disturbance. The natural lifespan of a plant appears to range from 25 to 60 years.|$|E

5|$|Sites at Watts Bar Dam, Muscle Shoals and Detroit were considered, but it {{was decided}} to build it at the Clinton Engineer Works, where water could be {{obtained}} from the Clinch River and steam from the K-25 power house. The thermal diffusion project was codenamed S-50. An S-50 Division was created at the Manhattan District headquarters in June under Lieutenant Colonel Mark C. Fox, with Major Thomas J. Evans, Jr., as his assistant with special authority for plant construction. Groves selected the H. K. Ferguson Company of Cleveland, Ohio, as the prime construction contractor on its record of finishing jobs on time, notably the Gulf Ordnance Plant in Mississippi, on a cost plus fixed fee contract. The H. A. Jones Construction Company would build the steam plant, with H. K. Ferguson as engineer-architect. Although his advisors had estimated that it would <b>take</b> <b>six</b> months to build the plant, Groves gave H. K. Ferguson just four, and he wanted operations to commence in just 75 days.|$|E
5|$|The tour {{moved to}} Australia and Bosanquet scored fifties against the three states which Hawke's team played, accumulating 168 runs {{at an average}} of 33.60. As a bowler, he took eight wickets at 42.75. His best bowling {{performance}} was to <b>take</b> <b>six</b> for 153 out of a New South Wales total of 463. This included the wicket of Victor Trumper, the leading Australian batsman {{and one of the best}} in the world at the time. Bosanquet delivered two conventional leg breaks followed by a googly, later described by Bosanquet as the first bowled in Australia, which bowled Trumper. Many critics were impressed by the wicket-taking potential of googly bowling on hard pitches and Warner later described Bosanquet's bowling as causing a sensation.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Rouen duck, {{the other}} popular meat variety in England in the 19th century, Aylesbury ducks lay eggs from early November. Aylesbury ducks fatten quickly and by eight weeks after {{hatching}} weigh up to , {{large enough to}} eat but still young and extremely tender. Consequently, their meat came onto the market from February onwards, after {{the close of the}} game season but before the earliest spring chickens were on sale. Rouen ducks, whose mallard-like coloration made them less valuable, lay eggs from early February and <b>take</b> <b>six</b> months to grow large enough to eat. As a consequence, Aylesbury ducks were sold primarily in the spring and summer, and Rouen ducks in the autumn and winter.|$|E

5|$|In the {{following}} seasons, Surrey dropped steadily down the Championship table. Fender {{failed to reach}} 1,000 runs in 1927, although his average of 31.96 was his best for five seasons; he also took 89 wickets at 25.75. That season, he achieved {{one of the best}} bowling performances of his career when he took six wickets in 11 balls against Middlesex, to become the first player in first-class cricket to <b>take</b> <b>six</b> wickets in so few deliveries. This remained a record until 1972 when Pat Pocock took seven wickets in 11 balls. Fender went on to take seven wickets in 19 balls; his final analysis was seven for 10. The following two seasons were his best with the bat; in 1928, he scored 1,376 runs at 37.18, his highest average in a season, and in 1929 he scored 1,625 runs, his highest run aggregate. He was less successful with the ball: in 1928 he took 110 wickets but his bowling average rose to 28, and took 88 wickets at an average of over 30 in 1929. His good form at the start of 1929 led to his recall to the England team, and he played one Test against South Africa. This was his final Test; overall, in 13 Tests, he scored 380 runs at an average of 19.00 and took 29 wickets at 40.86. By that season, Surrey had fallen to tenth in the table.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} his first for Starbucks' Hear Music record label, after {{previously}} having a 45-year-old relationship with Capitol/EMI. The recording contract with Capitol/EMI ended a few {{months prior to the}} release of the album, after McCartney had found out that EMI were planning to <b>take</b> <b>six</b> months to set up a promotional plan for the album. McCartney was the first artist to sign to Hear Music. The album was released on 4 June 2007 in the UK, and a day later on the 5th in the US, and with a vinyl edition later in the month on 25 June. In the US, Memory Almost Full debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200 with about 161,000 copies sold within the first week, making it McCartney's highest-charting album there since 1997's Flaming Pie. 47% of the album sales from the opening week were from Starbucks coffee shops, which were the best sales for any album in the history of Starbucks. While it was announced that copies of the album sold in the Starbucks coffee shops in the UK would not be counted by the Official UK Charts, because they are not registered in the copies counting system, Memory Almost Full, however, still managed to hit number 5 on the UK Album Charts. The album was also peaked at number 1 on Billboard Internet Sales Chart, and number 3 on Billboard Top Internet Albums Downloads.|$|E
5|$|The suspect (later {{identified}} as David Lace) was discovered when {{the profile of}} the killer showed a partial match on the national database, which belonged to a sibling of a previous suspect. A further sample was taken from another sibling, who was not on the database, to help confirm the match via a process called familial searching. At first the police refused to release the identity of the new prime suspect, except to reveal that he had committed suicide in 1988, and had confessed to DeSimone's murder while in custody for an unrelated crime in 1983, 18 months after Hodgson's conviction. His body was exhumed at Kingston cemetery in Portsmouth on 12 August 2009 in order to compare his DNA to that found at the crime scene. Hampshire Constabulary said the breakthrough in the case was only possible because of advances in forensic science and tests on the body would <b>take</b> <b>six</b> weeks, after which a file on the dead suspect could then be submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service. Visitors to the cemetery in Portsmouth said the grave of the suspect had no headstone and was untended. Police revealed that the suspect's confession was one of seven which had been made since Hodgson's conviction.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{arrival at}} Plymouth, Lord Clyde was paid off {{and a new}} engine was built for her at Devonport Dockyard. In addition, her {{four-bladed}} propeller {{was replaced by a}} lighter, two-bladed propeller with less drag and the ship was rearmed. She remained in reserve until 1871 when she recommissioned under the command of Captain John Bythesea, an officer who had won the Victoria Cross during the Crimean War of 1854–55. Lord Clyde rejoined the Mediterranean Fleet; six months after her arrival, she ran aground herself whilst attempting to rescue a British steamship that had gone aground off the island of Pantellaria. Attempts to lighten the ship enough to float her off were futile and she remained stuck fast taking damage from wave action that strained her back and wrenched off her sternpost, rudder post and rudder. Lord Warden was able to pull her off and tow her to be repaired at Malta where the dockyard estimated repairs would <b>take</b> <b>six</b> months. Bythesea and his navigator were convicted during their court-martial and neither ever served at sea again.|$|E
