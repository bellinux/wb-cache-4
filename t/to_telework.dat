Telework relates to continuity of operations (COOP) and national pandemic preparedness planning, reducing {{dependence on foreign oil}} and the burden of rising gas prices, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC), and a focus on recruitment and retention. During a keynote address at the September 12, 2007 Telework Exchange Town Hall Meeting, Lurita Doan, at that time the Administrator for the General Services Administration, announced an aggressive commitment goal to increase agency telework participation.

40|$|This study uses a {{knowledge}} transfer perspective, focusing both on 'disruptive' and 'commiting' consequences of teleworking affecting organisational knowledge transfer, to understand {{variations in the}} adoption and formalisation of teleworking practices in organisations. It hypothesises {{the influence of a}} set of conditions related to the so-called 'knowledge transfer risk': constituent characteristics (i. e., the percentage of knowledge workers; the presence of time and spatial flexible work arrangements; and output management), cultural compatibility (flexible organisational culture), and management cognition (managers' perceived <b>telework</b> attributes relating <b>to</b> productivity; social cohesion; and work-life balance). Hypotheses are tested through a series of multivariate logistic regression analyses. Survey data were collected in 2003 among 407 firms. Our study shows that firms are more likely <b>to</b> integrate <b>teleworking</b> practices in their strategic HR management policies and introduce formal teleworking policies as a long-term investment in (highly-valued) personnel, when the knowledge transfer risk is lower and when they anticipate higher organisational commitment and productivity levels due <b>to</b> <b>teleworking.</b> These findings indicate direction for policy makers that aim <b>to</b> stimulate <b>telework</b> adoption and formalisation of fair telework policies...|$|R

Through an in-depth analysis of 10 individual cases of consultants benefitting from specific work-life balance arrangements (ranging from sabbatical leaves <b>to</b> <b>teleworking</b> or part-time work), we analyse how they navigate their atypical situation in order to avoid stigmatisation. We show that their accounts are characterised by a strong ambivalence between a discourse of resistance emphasising the uniqueness of their situation and a discourse of compliance very much in line with the dominant ideology. We propose the concept of “conforming work” to better understand how individuals handle the gap between their practices, that they perceive as counter-normative, and expectations of conformity to the norm...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the wide}} {{dissemination}} {{and acceptance of}} teleworking, there are negative effects for employees. Literature shows that these negative effects of <b>telework</b> lead <b>to</b> undesired outcomes for teleworkers such as telework-exhaustion. The present research, however, goes one step further by identifying three significant telework-characteristics and hypothesizing the relationship between telework-characteristics and telework-enabled stressors. By doing so, one can understand the reason why telework-enabled stressors are perceived and identify the source of these stressors, which can then be counteracted to maintain the advantages of teleworking. Therefore, this research investigates {{the influence of the}} following telework-characteristics - information undersupply, autonomy, and isolation - on telework-enabled stressors and accordingly on telework-exhaustion and on the intention <b>to</b> continue <b>teleworking.</b> Results of an analysis on 310 teleworkers show that telework-characteristics influence telework-enabled stressors and accordingly increase the extent of telework-exhaustion and decrease the intention <b>to</b> continue <b>teleworking...</b>|$|R

Coworkers who do not telework can feel resentful and jealous because they may consider it unfair {{if they are not}} allowed <b>to</b> <b>telework</b> as well. However, despite fewer interpersonal actions and professional isolation, a meta-analysis of telecommuting did not find support for negative telecommuter-coworker relationships or telecommuter-supervisor relationships.

50|$|International {{evidence}} and experience shows that telework can deliver {{a broad range}} of benefits to individuals, employers and society as a whole. Telework is a shift in the way business is accomplished which can make a difference overtime. As an example, a recent Australian study revealed that telework enabled by the National Broadband Network is expected to add $8.3 billion to Gross Domestic Product by 2020, creating the equivalent of an additional 25,000 full-time jobs. Around 10,000 of these jobs will be in regional Australia. When it comes to environment, {{it has been estimated that}} if 10 per cent of Australian employees were <b>to</b> <b>telework</b> 50 percent of the time, it would save 120 million litres of fuel and 320,000 tonnes of carbon emissions. That rate of telework would also deliver a productivity benefit of between $1.4 billion and $1.9 billion a year.|$|E

According to the report, {{there are more than}} 793,000 employees in the DoD and of those employees, 134,477 were deemed eligible for teleworking. Overall, the federal government seems to have embraced teleworking and is attempting to create more remote working opportunities for employees.

Suggestions include using telework as a tool to retain employees at or near retirement age and using telework to expand hiring of highly trained disabled veterans.|$|E

30|$|Aspects {{related to}} the {{sustainability}} of the software development process have become increasingly important in recent times (Penzenstadler et al. 2012). In future work, we aim to devise more sustainable RE approaches, and the reuse-based requirements specification techniques put into practice in this work could be a promising contribution in this regard. There are many potential benefits of using requirements catalogues to promote the reuse of software artifacts. More requirements reuse means more productivity, which is normally pursued by companies, because it improves the business results. Another {{way of looking at}} this is the lower cost—i.e. time, effort, resources—at which software can be produced. As a result, companies could reduce the energy consumption and environmental impact associated with software development projects. For example, the experimental results presented in this work are supportive of the application of catalogue-based requirements reuse in GSD, which could encourage companies <b>to</b> resort <b>to</b> <b>teleworking</b> more often, thus reducing their carbon footprint.|$|R
