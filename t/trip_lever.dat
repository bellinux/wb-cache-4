50|$|These {{superseded}} wrap-spring single-revolution clutches in page printers, such as teleprinters, {{including the}} Teletype Model 28 and its successors, {{using the same}} design principles. IBM Selectric typewriters also used them. These are typically disc-shaped assemblies mounted on the driven shaft. Inside the hollow disc-shaped drive drum are two or three freely floating pawls arranged {{so that when the}} clutch is tripped, the pawls spring outward much like the shoes in a drum brake. When engaged, the load torque on each pawl transfers to the others to keep them engaged. These clutches do not slip once locked up, and they engage very quickly, on the order of milliseconds. A trip projection extends out from the assembly. If the <b>trip</b> <b>lever</b> engaged this projection, the clutch was disengaged. When the <b>trip</b> <b>lever</b> releases this projection, internal springs and friction engage the clutch. The clutch then rotates one or more turns, stopping when the <b>trip</b> <b>lever</b> again engages the trip projection.|$|E
5000|$|In 1928, Frederick G. Creed {{developed}} a single-turn spring clutch (see above) that was particularly {{well suited to}} the repetitive start-stop action required in teleprinters. [...] In 1942, two employees of Pitney Bowes Postage Meter Company {{developed a}}n improved single turn spring clutch. [...] In these clutches, a coil spring is wrapped around the driven shaft and held in an expanded configuration by the <b>trip</b> <b>lever.</b> When tripped, the spring rapidly contracts around the power shaft engaging the clutch. At {{the end of one}} revolution, if the <b>trip</b> <b>lever</b> has been reset, it catches the end of the spring (or a pawl attached to it) and the angular momentum of the driven member releases the tension on the spring. These clutches have long operating lives, many have cycled for tens and perhaps hundreds of millions of cycles without need of maintenance other than occasional lubrication.|$|E
5000|$|Pick A Toilet {{gave it a}} {{total score}} of 4.6/5, saying [...] "this is a very {{efficient}} good value for money toilet. The option to have the <b>trip</b> <b>lever</b> {{on either side of}} the tank, together with the shape and height of the seat make the Drake fully ADA compliant" [...] and gave it ratings of 4.5/5 for the design/materials and 4.7/5 for the cleaning, but noted that it uses 1.6 gallons per flush and therefore does not meet EPA WaterSense guidelines, which rules out use in municipalities that have strcit water conservation regulations in force, such as Los Angeles.|$|E
5000|$|In 1559, Taqi al-Din {{invented a}} six-cylinder 'Monobloc' pump. It was a hydropowered water-raising machine {{incorporating}} valves, suction and delivery pipes, piston rods with lead weights, <b>trip</b> <b>levers</b> with pin joints, and cams on the axle of a water-driven scoop-wheel. His 'Monobloc' pump could also create a partial vacuum, which was formed [...] "as the lead weight moves upwards, it pulls the piston with it, creating vacuum which sucks the water through a non return clack valve into the piston cylinder." ...|$|R
50|$|This starter {{includes}} a no-voltage magnetic holding feature, which causes the rheostat to spring to the off position if power is lost, {{so that the}} motor does not later attempt to restart in the full-voltage position. It also has overcurrent protection that <b>trips</b> the <b>lever</b> to the off position if excessive current over a set amount is detected.|$|R
5000|$|As the spade moves forward, {{it pushes}} the {{projectile}} and powder case into the chamber. The spade's time of travel, {{from the rear}} of the tray to the breech, is one second. As it approaches breech, the Cross Head pushes through a spring latch that locks it there. At the same time, the Cross Head <b>trips</b> another <b>lever</b> connected to the Rammer Controller, and the Controller releases the hydraulic pressure to the Ram Cylinder.|$|R
50|$|The HK43, {{which was}} the {{precursor}} to the HK93, was {{for the most part}} identical in appearance to the HK33. Instead of a “push-pin” grip housing, it came with a clip-on style grip housing marked “SF.” In order to save money, H&K used the same fire control group that went into the HK33 models, but with some modifications. The auto-sear was removed from the fire control group, as well as the <b>trip</b> <b>lever,</b> to prevent automatic fire. Moreover, the grip frame housing was modified to prevent the selector lever from going into the full-auto position. The one other modification H&K made for the HK43s was to mill off the trip ledge on the bolt carrier assembly.|$|E
50|$|A Spring Starter uses {{potential}} energy {{stored in a}} spring {{wound up with a}} crank to start an engine without a battery or alternator. Turning the crank moves the pinion into mesh with the engine’s ring gear, then winds up the spring. Pulling the release lever then applies the spring tension to the pinion, turning the ring gear to start the engine. The pinion automatically disengages from the flywheel after operation. Provision is also made to allow the engine to be slowly turned over by hand for engine maintenance. This is achieved by operating the <b>trip</b> <b>lever</b> just after the pinion has engaged with the flywheel. Subsequent turning of the winding handle during this operation will not load the starter. Spring starters can be found in engine-generators, hydraulic power packs, and on lifeboat engines, with the most common application being backup starting system on seagoing vessels.|$|E
5000|$|The MG 15 fires {{from an open}} bolt, {{meaning that}} the bolt stays back when the gun is ready to fire, and also making it nearly {{impossible}} for [...] "through the propeller" [...] synchronized forward firing on a fuselage mount. Pulling the trigger releases the bolt and allows it to go forward, stripping a round from the magazine. The bolt continues pushing the round into the chamber and locks up when the lockring rotates and locks the bolt and barrel extension together. At this point the <b>trip</b> <b>lever</b> releases the firing pin and the gun fires. Recoil pushes the barrel, lock and bolt backwards until the lockring hits a cam that rotates it unlocking the bolt and barrel. Inertia carries the bolt backwards until {{the base of the}} fired case hits the ejector flinging the empty out of the receiver. If the trigger is held down the cycle will continue. If the trigger is released the bolt will remain in the rearward position.|$|E
5000|$|The steer roper starts {{behind a}} [...] "barrier" [...] - a taut rope {{fastened}} with an easily broken string which is fastened lightly to the steer. When the roper {{calls for the}} steer, the chute man <b>trips</b> a <b>lever,</b> opening the doors. The steer breaks out running. When the steer reaches {{the end of the}} tether, the string breaks, releasing the barrier for the horse and roper. Should the roper break the barrier, a 10-second penalty is added to his time). The roper must throw his rope in a loop around the steer's horns.|$|R
50|$|By {{the middle}} of the 20th century, some {{high-end}} U.S. toasters featured automatic toast lowering and raising, with no levers to operate — simply dropping the slices into the machine commenced the toasting procedure. A notable example was the Sunbeam T-20, T-35 and T-50 models (identical except for details such as control positioning) made from the late 1940s through the 1960s, which used the mechanically multiplied thermal expansion of the resistance wire in the center element assembly to lower the bread; the inserted slice of bread <b>tripped</b> a <b>lever</b> to switch on the power which immediately caused the heating element to begin expanding thus lowering the bread.|$|R

5000|$|The calves {{are lined}} up {{in a row and}} moved through narrow runways leading to a chute with {{spring-loaded}} doors. When a calf enters the chute, a door is closed behind it and a lightweight 28 ft rope, attached to a <b>trip</b> <b>lever,</b> is fastened around the calf's neck. The lever holds a taut cord or [...] "barrier" [...] that runs across a large pen or [...] "box" [...] at one side of the calf chute, where the horse and rider wait. The barrier is used to ensure that the calf gets a head start. When the roper is ready, he (or, in some roping events, she) calls for the calf, and the chute operator pulls a lever opening the chute doors and releasing the calf. The calf runs out in a straight line. When the calf reaches the end of the rope, that trips the lever, the rope falls off the calf, and the barrier for the horse is released, starting the clock and allowing horse and rider to chase the calf.|$|E

50|$|This clock uses 20 {{counterweighted}} buckets {{that are}} free to swing and are mounted {{around the edge of}} a wheel 2.3 m in diameter. Water supplied from a meniscus-full tank runs into a bucket at a constant rate until the weight of water in the bucket is sufficient to overcome the counterweight (see the Chinese Buddha sculpture) allowing the bucket to tip over spilling its contents. As it falls, it <b>trips</b> a <b>lever</b> connected by a cable to a catch on top of the water wheel which is released to allow the wheel to rotate. However, by the time it has moved on, the catch has returned to its position locking the wheel in place so that the next empty bucket is now under the water flow to repeat the cycle.|$|R
5000|$|When the steer wrestler {{is ready}} he [...] "calls" [...] for the steer by {{nodding his head}} and the chute man <b>trips</b> a <b>lever</b> opening the doors. The {{suddenly}} freed steer breaks out running, shadowed by the hazer. When the steer reaches {{the end of his}} rope, it pops off and simultaneously releases the barrier for the steer wrestler. The steer wrestler attempts to catch up to the running steer, lean {{over the side of the}} horse which is running flat out and grab the horns of the running steer. The steer wrestler then is pulled off his horse by the slowing steer and plants his heels into the dirt further slowing the steer and himself. He then takes one hand off the horns, reaches down and grabs the nose of the steer pulling the steer off balance and ultimately [...] "throwing" [...] the steer to the ground. Once all four legs are off the ground, an official waves a flag marking the official end and a time is taken. The steer is released and trots off.|$|R

5|$|Seismometer: The Chinese polymath and {{inventor}} Zhang Heng (78–139) of the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) {{invented the}} first seismometer in 132, a large metal urn-shaped instrument which employed either a suspended pendulum or inverted pendulum acting on inertia (i.e. ground tremors from earthquakes) to dislodge a metal ball by a <b>lever</b> <b>trip</b> device; this ball would {{fall out of}} dragon-shaped metal mouth into the corresponding metal toad mouth indicating the exact cardinal direction of where a distant earthquake had occurred {{in order for the}} state to send swift aid and relief to the affected regions; several subsequent recreations of his device were employed by Chinese states up until the Tang Dynasty (618–907), when use of the device fell into obscurity, a fact noted even by the writer Zhou Mi around 1290, during the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368).|$|R
50|$|Since {{the money}} train now had no braking {{power and the}} {{throttle}} lever is jammed at full power, the brothers decide to throw it into reverse, derailing it and killing both of them but allowing the passengers to live.

When the trains collide one more time, the reverse lever is activated and both brothers jump across to the other train as the money train derails tumbles around several times knocking over several support beams (much to the horror of Patterson who witnesses the whole crash) before finally screeching to a stop on its side just before the station.|$|R
5000|$|On 21 December, Seadragon sighted {{an enemy}} {{submarine}} near Cape St. George, made her approach, and launched three torpedoes at the target. The first missed ahead. The second exploded about 18 seconds after firing. The third torpedo hit the target. [...] sank with her bow vertical {{and with all}} hands lost. The second torpedo explosion, however, had damaged Seadragon. The force of the explosion had knocked down the personnel in the forward torpedo room, and the final bow torpedo in No. 1 tube, the outer door of which was open, was forced against the tail buffer. The countermining effect forced the torpedo forward shearing off the guide stud and <b>tripping</b> the starting <b>lever.</b> The outer door could not be closed. Depth control was lost. The final bow torpedo was fired. Control was regained as the torpedo exploded on Seadragons port quarter at an estimated 200 yards.|$|R
500|$|Escapement, hydraulic-powered (use in clockworks): Although the {{escapement}} mechanism was first invented by the Greek Philon of Byzantium for a mechanical washstand, an {{escapement mechanism}} for clockworks was first {{developed by the}} Buddhist monk, court astronomer, mathematician and engineer Yi Xing (683–727) of the Tang Dynasty (618–907) for his water-powered celestial globe {{in the tradition of}} the Han dynasty polymath and inventor Zhang Heng (78–139), and could be found in later Chinese clockworks such as the clock towers developed by the military engineer Zhang Sixun (fl. late 10th century) and polymath inventor Su Song (1020–1101). Yi Xing's escapement allowed for a bell to be rung automatically every hour, and a drum beaten automatically every quarter-hour, essentially a striking clock. Unlike the modern escapement which employs a suspended oscillating pendulum resting and releasing its hooks on a small rotating gear wheel, the early Chinese escapement employed the use of gravity and hydraulics. In Su Song's clock tower, scoop containers fixed to the spokes of a vertical waterwheel (which acted like a gear wheel) would be filled one by one with siphoned water from a clepsydra tank. When the weight of the water in the scoop filled to an excess, it overcame a counterweight that in turn <b>tripped</b> a <b>lever</b> allowing the scoop to rotate on a pivot and drain its water. However, as the scoop fell, it tripped a coupling tongue that temporarily pulled down on a long vertical chain, the latter yanking down on a balancing lever which would pull upward on a small chain connected to a locking arm, the latter lifting momentarily to release the top arrested spoke before coming back down to repeat the entire process over again. It should be pointed out that the Chinese intermittently working liquid-driven escapement had [...] "only the name in common" [...] with the true mechanical escapement of medieval European mechanical clocks of the 14th century onwards, which worked instead with weights, producing continuous but discrete beats and that derived from the Greek and Roman verge mechanism (alarum) [...] device of earlier mechanisms.|$|R
2500|$|After its {{introduction}} to service, reports of unserviceability of the M3 commenced in February 1944 with stateside units in training, who reported early {{failure of the}} cocking handle/bolt retraction mechanism on some weapons. [...] Similar reports later came from U.S. forces in Britain who were issued the M3. [...] An investigation revealed several deficiencies {{in the construction of}} the M3's bolt retraction mechanism, together with issues concerning barrel removal and retention as well as easily bent rear sights. [...] As a result, several product improvements were incorporated into all new M3 production, including a new design retracting pawl with improved heat treatment, a new spring stop fitted to the right-hand brace of the retracting lever, a modified ejector featuring a cocking <b>lever</b> <b>trip,</b> a larger ratchet pad with improved heat treatment to more securely retain the barrel assembly, and strengthening gussets fitted to the sides of the fixed 'L' rear sight. [...] After new complaints were raised about accidental magazine releases and failure of the wire buttstock to remain in place in the collapsed position, two additional changes were made to M3 production and approved by Ordnance on 31 August 1944. [...] This included a small sheet metal guard around the magazine release button, and the inclusion of a stop between the two rods forming the wire stock at the butt end.|$|R
40|$|Thursday, September 4, 1997 WRITER: Kathy R. Pharr, 542 - 5172 CONTACT: Richard Ford, 548 - 1151 BRITISH BARRISTERS TO DEBATE UGA LAW STUDENTS ATHENS, Ga. [...] The {{skills of}} two third-year law {{students}} at the University of Georgia, Leigh Martin and Michael McCabe, {{will be put to}} the test next week as they debate two future British barristers in a case concerning British negligence law. The moot court competition will be held on Friday, September 12 at 3 : 30 p. m. in the law school 2 ̆ 7 s Hatton Lovejoy Courtroom. The competition marks the eighth exchange between UGA and Gray 2 ̆ 7 s Inn of London since 1983. Teams from the two institutions compete every other year, and in alternating years, the law school participates in a moot court exchange with King 2 ̆ 7 s Inns of Dublin, Ireland. The purpose is to promote law students 2 ̆ 7 knowledge of other cultures and legal systems. This year 2 ̆ 7 s hypothetical case concerns a police officer who sued his department for failure to provide proper safety equipment after he contracted the HIV virus while assisting the victim of a car wreck, who, unbeknownst to him, had AIDS. The police officer also sued the accident victim for general negligence, since the wreck had been caused when he forgot English traffic laws and drove {{on the wrong side of}} the road. Gray 2 ̆ 7 s Inn, one of the famed British Inns of Court, is a prestigious training ground for barristers. Under the English system of legal education, students major in law as an undergraduate, then become bar students at one of the Inns of Court. Those who pass the bar examination after a year of study become interns with barristers, the British version of trial lawyers. This summer, law faculty and three graduates of UGA 2 ̆ 7 s moot court program [...] members of the team which won the 1997 National Moot Court Competition [...] visited London as guests of Gray 2 ̆ 7 s Inn. In addition to participating in a moot court competition, they were treated to a tour of the English criminal court, dinner at Gray 2 ̆ 7 s Inn, and <b>trips</b> to <b>Lever</b> Castle and Cambridge. The four British students who travel to Georgia for the moot court exchange will enjoy a Bulldog football game in Sanford Stadium, tour the Georgia Supreme Court, visit the Atlanta law firm of Troutman Sanders, and be entertained at several dinners and receptions. The students are accompanied by the Honorable John Mummery, an appellate judge in England. The law school 2 ̆ 7 s participation in the Gray 2 ̆ 7 s Inn Exchange Program is financed in part by the William Carroll Brown Fund...|$|R
