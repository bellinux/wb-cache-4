Norrköping developed with the construction of a cotton refinery. It was at the Spring Fair in 1930. The industry in Norrköping, including textile manufacturers, expanded into the 20th century. Borås is the leading textile city of Sweden, starting as a location spot for textile mills. In Borås he established contact with the engineer {{and executive director of the}} textile firm AB Hugo Hennig & Company (Sven Bjurqvist), who also was the editor for the Scandinavian Journal of Textile Industry, where some articles of Kornél Tolnai was printed (i.e. No 7-8, 1931). Hugo Hennig also was a member of Flax Cultivation Committee in Sweden. He founded his own agency and machine company in Borås. Over time, the company became, under his sons direction, only a sales agency for a variety of manufacturers of machines and accessories for the textile industriy.|$|E

John Chiorini, a 17-year-old Eagle Scout, {{was working on the}} waterfront. [...] "Béla came through camp with a patrol of six or seven boys and commandeered me to teach a class on camp craft. He said he was trying out some new ideas with this patrol," [...] Chiorini reported [...] "Béla listened intently as I presented and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> up after and gave me some tips on teaching. He was a mentor to me from that point on." ...|$|E
500|$|The opening track, [...] "Dance on a Volcano" [...] was {{the first}} song written for the album. Rutherford felt in {{contrast}} to the material on The Lamb..., it was easy to write, and was intended to show how Genesis would move forward. [...] "Entangled" [...] was mostly written by Hackett, with help from Banks. Rutherford recalled that Hackett [...] "started writing verses which were very airy-fairy and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> down with a bang". [...] "Squonk" [...] is based on the North American tale of the Squonk which, when captured, dissolves in a pool of tears. The song combines a main theme written by Rutherford against a middle section written by Banks, and was designed to sound like Led Zeppelin's [...] "Kashmir".|$|E

500|$|Speaking {{about the}} reveal that Fitz was just imagining the {{presence}} of Simmons due to the injuries he sustained {{at the end of}} the first season, Tancharoen said, [...] "We didn’t want him to come out of that experience unscathed. He clearly suffered major trauma to his body. The lack of oxygen to his brain has to have consequences because that’s how it is in real life. We wanted there to be a price. Basically, he in his own Fitz way had professed his love for her, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> out of that. How do you come out of that experience without any physical damage, there would still be probably a change to their relationship because the feelings are out in the open. But, of course, being the people that we are, we wanted to make it even more painful and compound it." ...|$|E
500|$|James Caldwell, {{also of the}} Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter, {{published}} {{a review of the}} show in which he also gave ratings out of 5 stars and some comments on the top matches on the card. He considered the main event [...] "underwhelming" [...] due to the [...] "audience having sat through every possible gimmick match combination prior to another Joe-Booker bout that everyone knew was going to end with some sort of gimmicky finish" [...] and that it was [...] "not memorable" [...] but that it would [...] "generate talk about Jarrett." [...] He gave the bout 2 stars. [...] "That was an epic match", said Caldwell when discussing the Last Man Standing match. However, he felt the bout had a [...] "silly pin-and-count-'em stipulation" [...] and that the [...] "all-too-real neck injury angle, followed by some post-match activity that took away from Styles's win." [...] Caldwell felt the match made Styles look [...] "like a star when he won, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> across like a punk attacking Angle, then a fool being in position for Sting to take him out" [...] but that he had a [...] "memorable, star-making victory over Angle." [...] He disapproved of Styles being [...] "used a means to the end of explaining Sting's purpose-driven TNA life." [...] Caldwell rated the encounter 4 stars. As for the Street Fight, {{he said it was a}} [...] "fun brawl for the audience" [...] and gave it 2 1/2 stars. Caldwell believed that the World Tag Team Championship match had [...] "good heat" [...] that [...] "over-rode the stream of outside interference, referee incompetence, and overall over-booking" [...] and that it was [...] "refreshing to see TNA use an injury angle from TV to set-up the finish of an important PPV match." [...] He gave the match 3 stars. The X Division Championship match was given 3 stars and he said it would have been [...] "great" [...] if it had avoided involving [...] "outside interference." ...|$|E

Then it struck me that I had every reason to consider myself badly guided" [...] before that point (Loukomsky 1928). He turned for new, Neoclassical instruction from Antoine Decrezet, a friend of Winckelmann, and the former's pupil Niccola Giansimoni, measuring and drawing the antiquities of Rome.|$|E
2500|$|Sakharov later {{described}} {{that it took}} [...] "years" [...] for him to [...] "understand {{how much}} substitution, deceit, and lack of correspondence with reality there was" [...] in the Soviet ideals. [...] "At first I thought, despite everything that I saw with my own eyes, that the Soviet State was a breakthrough into the future, a kind of prototype for all countries". <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>came,</b> in his words, to [...] "the theory of symmetry: all governments and regimes to a first approximation are bad, all peoples are oppressed, and all are threatened by common dangers." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The young {{brother of}} Crazy Horse (Little Hawk) {{was on a}} trip where now is Utah, {{and there he was}} killed by some white settlers. [...] They were having some trouble with the Indians there. When Crazy Horse learned that his brother was killed he took his wife with him and went away but told no one where he was going. [...] He was gone for a long time. [...] He went to the place where his brother was killed and camped in the woods where he could see the settlement. [...] He stayed there nine days. [...] Every day he would look around and when he saw someone he would shoot him. [...] He killed enough to satisfy and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> home." ...|$|E

Merton was hurt.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, Freud used {{a form of}} {{treatment}} based on the one that Breuer had described to him, modified by what he called his [...] "pressure technique" [...] and his newly developed analytic technique of interpretation and reconstruction. According to Freud's later accounts of this period, {{as a result of}} his use of this procedure most of his patients in the mid-1890s reported early childhood sexual abuse. He believed these stories, which he used as the basis for his seduction theory, but <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to believe that they were fantasies. He explained these at first as having the function of [...] "fending off" [...] memories of infantile masturbation, but in later years he wrote that they represented Oedipal fantasies, stemming from innate drives that are sexual and destructive in nature.|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} typical mythology in the Talmud exists as a {{discussion}} about a giant deer and a giant lion which are both originated in a mythical forest called [...] "Bei Ilai". ('Bei' means house in Aramaic) The deer is called [...] "keresh", it has one horn, and its skin measures 15 cubits in length. The lion, called [...] "tigris", {{is said to be}} so big that there is a space of 9 cubits between its ears. The Roman Caesar Hadrian once asked Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah to show him this lion, since every lion can be killed, but the Rabbi refused and pointed out {{that this is not a}} normal lion. The Roman Caesar insisted, so the Rabbi reluctantly called for the lion of [...] "Bei Ilai". He roared once from a distance of 400 [...] parasangs, and all pregnant women miscarried and all the city walls of Rome tumbled down. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to 300 parasangs and roared again, and the front teeth and molars of Roman men fell out, and even the emperor himself fell from his throne. He begged the Rabbi to send it back. The Rabbi prayed and it returned to its place.|$|E
2500|$|The 20/20 Experience was {{produced}} in a span of 20 days. Recording sessions for The 20/20 Experience began in the [...] "late part of May, first week in June" [...] and concluded in July 2012. [...] The album was recorded at EastWest Studios in Los Angeles, Jungle City Studios in New York City and Larrabee Studios in North Hollywood. Of Timbaland's participation, Wright said: [...] "(Their) relationship is like a brotherhood; they're just so comfortable with each other– not only as musical friends but as personal friends... {{that you can get}} things done {{in a short period of}} time. Had (the Affleck movie) not happened, we might have actually set up and put the album out sooner." [...] After recording was finished, Timberlake and Wright, with M2M Construction, begin [...] "formulating plans for how to release the music". Justin Timberlake, and most of the band used JH Audio in-ear monitoring systems. With regards to the album's lead single [...] "Suit & Tie", Timberlake shared with 97.1 AMP Radio/Los Angeles how the classic, [...] "Get out your seat, Hov" [...] lyric was born inside the studio with JAY-Z: [...] "I had finished the verses and I was going in to record them and he was sitting in the room working, freestyling to himself. And <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> up with a line he really liked and he jumped out of his seat and he said, 'Uh oh! Get out of that seat, Hov.' And I just thought it was so funny. It made me laugh. I was standing right beside him when he did it and so I just put it on the record, more or less as a joke to him." [...] Timberlake added that the song harkens back to the glory years of the Rat Pack. [...] "Not to compare ourselves to those guys, but just the fun that they had," [...] he said. [...] "I was picturing like, being at the Sands in Vegas and saying, 'Oh, JAY-Z's in the house tonight. Uh, let's have him come up and do a number. Why don't you go ahead and get out of your seat, Hov?' That's more or less where it came from." ...|$|E
