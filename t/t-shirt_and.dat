5|$|Naughty Dog based Drake's {{appearance}} and personality on daredevil Johnny Knoxville, actor Harrison Ford, and {{the heroes of}} pulp magazines, novels and films. To make him relatable, the character was dressed {{in jeans and a}} <b>T-shirt,</b> <b>and</b> given an everyman persona; he is strong-willed, and often jokes and quips. The designers focused on giving him realistic reactions to his environment; for example, he stumbles while running, barely clears objects during leaps, and recognizes the absurdity of the situations in which he finds himself.|$|E
5|$|The band {{met at the}} Londonderry Hotel on Park Lane, {{overlooking}} the park, where they had booked a tenth-floor suite, and proceeded to the park in the armoured personnel carrier, together with their two official photographers, Michael Cooper and Spanish Tony Sanchez. They alighted from the carrier into a caravan-trailer behind the stage. Jagger, his face heavily made up and with a studded leather collar around his neck, was clad in a white dress. He had borrowed the dress, which had been made for Sammy Davis Jr. at the Mr. Fish boutique, and wore it to Prince Rupert Lowenstein's white ball, where he had shown it to Princess Margaret. Jagger was only to wear it for half-an-hour at the Hyde Park concert, after which he tore it off to reveal a violet <b>T-shirt</b> <b>and</b> white loon pants.|$|E

5|$|The visual {{is almost}} {{six and a}} half minutes long. As the video begins, waves are seen {{crashing}} on a night time beach. Nearly a minute later, Beyoncé appears; she is strolling on a beach at night and she seemingly carries a massive trophy while an eerie music is playing in the background. Sporting a sheer negligee that reveals her bra and panties beneath, she twists her body in the sand. The singer also dances seductively against a backdrop of smoke and mouths the song's lyrics, staring at the camera. Beyoncé is later joined by husband Jay-Z, who is wearing a <b>T-shirt</b> <b>and</b> a backwards baseball cap. He raps with his eyes down holding a glass with alcohol in his hand while Beyoncé mouths the words behind him, smiling. The last seconds of the video show Beyoncé dancing and it concludes with close-up shots of the singer's face.|$|E
5|$|Commercials {{instructed}} fans to mail in episodes' geographical destinations during sweeps week.

Turner selected ten viewers from the United States and nine from Latin America and Asia as grand-prize winners. They and two-hundred others received Quest-themed adventure packs, including a backpack, flashlight and siren, travel journal, pen, <b>T-shirt,</b> <b>and</b> glow sticks. Cartoon Network aired the names of winning children on a special feature in which Jeremiah Surd issued personal threats.|$|E
5|$|Reso {{made his}} {{debut in the}} Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) {{promotion}} on November 13, 2005 at TNA's Genesis PPV event under his old ring name Christian Cage. Cage then made his way the ring, where he grabbed a microphone and announced his intentions to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship held by Jeff Jarrett, after taking a few shots at his former employer. Coach Scott D'Amore and Bobby Roode of the villainous Team Canada alliance then {{made their way to}} the ring. D'Amore then offered Cage a position in Team Canada (since Reso is Canadian) and even giving him a Team Canada <b>T-shirt</b> <b>and</b> telling Cage to take his time on making a decision. Later in the night after the main event, a six-man tag team match pitting the team of Jarrett and America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) (AMW) against Rhino and Team 3D (Brother Ray and Brother Devon), Cage ran down to the ring while Team Canada (D'Amore, Roode, Eric Young, and A-1), AMW, and Jarrett were assaulting Rhino and Team 3D. After Cage entered the ring, he removed the jacket he was wearing to reveal the Team Canada T-shirt he was given earlier by D'Amore. D'Amore immediately rejoiced that Cage was seemingly a member of Team Canada until Cage turned on D'Amore and performed his Unprettier maneuver; Cage's act also solidified his character as a face. Cage, Rhino, and Team 3D attacked AMW and Team Canada and threw them out of the ring; they then forced the remaining Jarrett through a wooden table after Cage removed his Team Canada shirt to reveal a hidden TNA T-shirt.|$|E

The Gray Uniform consists of a gray <b>T-shirt</b> <b>and</b> gray shorts. The band hat with plume is worn with this uniform.|$|E
