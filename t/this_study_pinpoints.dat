30|$|Discussion <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>pinpoints</b> three {{interesting}} findings. First, it is {{well known}} that hypernatremic metabolic alkalosis may occur under CBA-CRRT in case of using trisodium citrate, which contains a high sodium load (408  mmol/L) as compared to 18 / 0 citrate (140  mmol/L of sodium), but the mild risk of alkalosis due to hypochloremia using dilute citrate (86  mmol/L in 18 / 0) is mostly unrecognized. However, no patient presented severe metabolic alkalosis, but natremia was significantly higher in group A and chloremia lower in group B. Second, hypophosphoremia rate, which has been diagnosed in as many as 65  % of the patients undergoing CRRT when using dialysis or replacement solutions without phosphate, is effectively decreased by using phosphate containing solutions. Finally, attention must be drawn on the high proportion of hypomagnesaemia, even if dialysis and replacement solutions contain magnesium, as citrate creates complex with magnesium as well as calcium.|$|E

American think-tanks, on the other hand, do not have such institutional credibility, and therefore need to provide evidence of their credibility to their main constituencies, especially in making their case for funding.

A qualitative research approach was employed in the study. The study used interviewing as the data collection method. Eight participants were interviewed to find out about their perceptions regarding what factors contributed to the over representation of minority students into special education. Participants perceived that socioeconomic status (SES), cultural differences, teacher characteristics, language, high transiency, assessment, impact of history and gender differences were factors in the overrepresentation of minority students in special education. An analysis of the data revealed that the issue of over representation is multifaceted, complex and interrelated. In light of the above, the study identified {{that there is a need}} for transformation in the current school system to accommodate changing demographics in order to make education more equitable for minority students. Most participants believed that there is a need for inclusion of minority cultural knowledge in the curriculum and assessment process.

Out of 854 publications identified in literature search, 54 papers were retained after screening and eligibility checks, providing in total 82 case studies with unique extreme event—ecological response associations for which data were extracted.

Indeed, mounting evidence implicates splicing factors in signal transduction of the abscisic acid (ABA) phytohormone, which plays pivotal roles in the response to various abiotic stresses. Using real-time RT-qPCR, we analyzed total steady-state transcript levels of the 18 SR and two SR-like genes from Arabidopsis thaliana in seedlings treated with ABA and in genetic backgrounds with altered expression of the ABA-biosynthesis ABA 2 and the ABA-signaling ABI 1 and ABI 4 genes. We also searched for ABA-responsive cis elements in the upstream regions of the 20 genes. We found {{that members of the}} plant-specific SC 35 -Like (SCL) Arabidopsis SR protein subfamily are distinctively responsive to exogenous ABA, while the expression of seven SR and SR-related genes is affected by alterations in key components of the ABA pathway. Finally, despite pervasiveness of established ABA-responsive promoter elements in Arabidopsis SR and SR-like genes, their expression is likely governed by additional, yet unidentified cis-acting elements.
