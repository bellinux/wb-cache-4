He saw action with these units in the Battle of France, Battle of Britain, and Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, before he transferred to the night fighter force. He claimed his first aerial victory on the night of 6/7 May 1942.

5|$|In the 18th century, Shakespeare became {{associated}} with rising British nationalism, and Boydell tapped {{into the same}} mood that many other entrepreneurs were exploiting. Shakespeare appealed not only to a social elite who prided themselves on their artistic taste, but also <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>emerging</b> middle class who saw in Shakespeare's works {{a vision of a}} diversified society. The mid-century Shakespearean theatrical revival was probably most responsible for reintroducing the British public to Shakespeare. Shakespeare's plays were integral to the theatre's resurgence at this time. Despite the upsurge in theatre-going, writing tragedies was not profitable, and thus few good tragedies were written. Shakespeare's works filled the gap in the repertoire, and his reputation grew as a result. By the end of the 18th century, one out of every six plays performed in London was by Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s blues music was largely known in Britain through blues-influenced boogie-woogie, and the jump blues of Fats Waller and Louis Jordan. Imported {{recordings}} of American artists were brought over by African American servicemen stationed in Britain {{during and after}} World War II, merchant seamen visiting the ports of London, Liverpool, Newcastle on Tyne and Belfast, and in a trickle of (illegal) imports. From 1955 major British record labels HMV and EMI (the latter, particularly through their subsidiary Decca Records), began to distribute American jazz and increasingly blues records <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>emerging</b> market.|$|E

By the end of March, he had accumulated 21 aerial victories for which he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 16 April 1942. He received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves on 2 August 1943, for 45 aerial victories. He was promoted to Major and tasked with leading Nachtjagdgeschwader 5 (NJG5) in January 1944, before he and his crew were killed in a flight accident on 12 March 1944.|$|E

5|$|The Second World War {{caused a}} drastic setback <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>emerging</b> breed, {{with the vast}} {{majority}} of breeding stock destroyed because of wartime hardship and food shortages. For instance, in the Ttiweh Cavalier Kennel, the population of sixty dogs dropped to three during the 1940s. Following the war, just six dogs would survive as the new beginning from which all present-day Cavaliers descend. These dogs were Ann's Son, his litter brother Wizbang Timothy, Carlo of Ttiweh, Duce of Braemore, Kobba of Kuranda and Aristide of Ttiweh. The numbers increased gradually, and in 1945 the Kennel Club first recognised the breed in its own right as the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.|$|E

30|$|Our {{approach}} {{began with}} open coding {{of the available}} data. Specifically, we identified and categorized different variables of the phenomenon studied by examining the data. We thus noted a series of recurrent themes raised during individual interviews, related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> initial hypotheses. We then performed selective analysis of <b>the</b> data. <b>To</b> do so, we identified the constants within each initial category <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> <b>emerging</b> theory (Gray 2004). We analyzed the relations between <b>the</b> <b>emerging</b> theories and <b>the</b> data available <b>to</b> validate <b>the</b> <b>emerging</b> theories, and identified differences in viewpoints by situating them in their context to define whether these divergences represented marginal exceptions or new emerging theories. After having established <b>the</b> <b>emerging</b> theories and created relations among them, we reached the findings presented in this article.|$|R
