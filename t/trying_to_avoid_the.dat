5|$|From 1840 onwards {{he became}} a leading chess commentator, and won matches against top players of the 1840s. In 1847 he entered a {{parallel}} career as a Shakespearean scholar. Ill health and his two writing careers led him to give up competitive chess after 1851. In 1858 {{attempts were made to}} organise a match between Staunton and Paul Morphy, but they failed. It is often alleged that Staunton deliberately misled Morphy while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> match, but it is also possible Staunton overestimated his chances of getting physically fit and of making time available for a match.|$|E
5|$|The multifidus muscles run up {{and down}} along the back of the spine, and are {{important}} for keeping the spine straight and stable during many common movements such as sitting, walking and lifting. A problem with these muscles is often found in someone with chronic low back pain, because the back pain causes the person to use the back muscles improperly in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> pain. The problem with the multifidus muscles continues even after the pain goes away, and is probably an important reason why the pain comes back. Teaching people with chronic low back pain how to use these muscles is recommended as part of a recovery program.|$|E
5|$|As per his contract, Webber {{started the}} year in Melbourne with Red Bull Racing. He {{recorded}} top-six lap times {{in each of the}} three practice sessions, and was on his way to the top ten in the qualifying session when the front right brake disc in his car failed going into turn 6 during Q2, sending him spinning off into the sand trap ending his qualifying session, and resulting in 15th position on the grid. Although starting well, he momentarily went off the track at turn 1 to avoid being involved in contact that had already erupted. Webber made several positions by turn 3 but an incident involving himself, Kazuki Nakajima and Anthony Davidson when he was slightly contacted by Davidson whilst <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> struggle between the other two drivers, ended his race.|$|E

25|$|This {{race was}} held June 17 at Kentucky Speedway. Denny Hamlin won the pole.

Wales led 15–0 after 15 minutes and 18–15 at half-time, and though England managed to draw {{level in the}} second half, James Hook then kicked two penalties and a drop goal, to give Wales the victory by 27–18. This result confirmed France's position as champions and handed the wooden spoon to Scotland, both on points difference.|$|E
25|$|Debogorski, Rowland, Jessee, Hall, and Kelly {{continue}} {{driving the}} Dalton Highway for Carlile this season.

Rowland spent the season <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> Department of Transport (DOT) Weigh station. Jessee was assigned {{some of the toughest}} loads, to be taken over some of the roughest roads. Kelly started out the season with goals to achieve: she wanted to try hauling heavier, bigger loads and have a go at push-truck driving; she also aimed to save enough money to buy back her horse. Both goals she eventually achieved.|$|E
25|$|All three {{battalion}} advances {{were turned}} back with great losses. The final group, led by Wells and Farnsworth, circled back toward Big Round Top, where they met {{a line of}} the 15th Alabama across their front. Farnsworth's party had dwindled to only ten troopers as they weaved back and forth, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> murderous fire. Farnsworth fell from his horse, struck in the chest, abdomen and leg by five bullets. Postwar accounts by a Confederate soldier who claimed Farnsworth committed suicide with his pistol to avoid capture have been discounted. Maj. Wells received the Medal of Honor for his heroism in leading {{the rest of his}} men back to safety. The Vermont regiment suffered 65 casualties during the futile assault.|$|E

25|$|Leung {{came under}} severe {{criticism}} in January 2003 {{when he bought}} a HK$790,000 (US$101,282) Lexus LS 430, just weeks before he raised the tax on new vehicles in his March budget. Although Leung claimed that he had decided on the tax increase after buying the car, which he said his family needed because of the arrival of his first-born in February. Leung denied that he was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> new tax, which would have cost him an additional HK$180,000. (USD 23,000). However, unlike {{other members of the}} Executive Council, Leung had failed to disclose the purchase to the council. News of the car purchase dealt a blow to the Hong Kong government's credibility {{as well as to the}} effectiveness of the newly introduced Principal Officials Accountability System (POAS).|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} Antipas' {{involvement}} has been debated. Theodor Mommsen {{argued that the}} normal legal procedure of the early Roman empire was for defendants to be tried by the authorities of their home provinces. A. N. Sherwin-White re-examined the relevant legal texts and concluded that trials were generally based on {{the location of the}} alleged crimes, but that there was a possibility of referral to a province of origin in special cases. If Pilate was not required to send Jesus to Antipas, he may have been making a show of courtesy to the tetrarch and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> need to deal with the Jewish authorities himself. When Jesus was sent back, Pilate could still have represented Antipas' failure to convict as support for his own view (according to Luke) that Jesus was not guilty of a capital offence, thus allowing him to avoid responsibility for Jesus' crucifixion.|$|E
25|$|In August, the Talmadges {{left for}} California, where Norma's first role was in Captivating Mary Carstairs. The whole {{enterprise}} was a fiasco; the sets and costumes were cheap and the studio itself lacked adequate backing. The film was a flop, {{and the small}} new studio shut down {{after the release of}} Mary Carstairs. The demise of National Pictures Company left the family stranded in California after only one picture. Deciding it was smarter to aim high, they went to the Triangle Film Corporation, where D.W. Griffith was supervising productions. On the strength of The Battle Cry, Talmadge got a contract with Griffith's Fine Arts Company. For eight months, she starred in seven features for Triangle, including the comedy The Social Secretary (1916), a comedy written by Anita Loos and directed by John Emerson, that gave her an opportunity to disguise her beauty as a girl <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> unwelcome attentions of her male employers.|$|E

25|$|Chaz Mostert won {{the first}} race of the Skycity Triple Crown ahead of {{teammate}} Mark Winterbottom. Rick Kelly took his second podium finish in three races by finishing third. James Courtney had taken pole position but tangled with Shane Van Gisbergen and Garth Tander on a restart after a safety car period, with Courtney penalised {{for his role in}} the incident. Jamie Whincup, Craig Lowndes and Jason Bright also received points penalties for various incidents during the race. Lowndes recovered in the second race to score his 100th career victory in the Australian Touring Car Championship and V8 Supercars, becoming the first driver to reach the mark. Tim Slade finished second ahead of Mostert. Rick Kelly had qualified on pole position for the first time since 2011 but collided with Fabian Coulthard at the first corner and received a drive-through penalty. David Reynolds took pole position for the Sunday race but Coulthard took the lead at the start. Coulthard lost the lead when he went off the track while lapping Andre Heimgartner, losing places to Reynolds and Mostert. Reynolds himself ran off the circuit in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> lapped Michael Caruso, cutting off a portion of the track in the process. After retaking his place behind Caruso, Reynolds held off Mostert to take victory. A delaminated tyre for Lowndes towards the end of the race dropped him to fifteenth, allowing Winterbottom to extend his championship lead to 95 points.|$|E
500|$|The {{first single}} {{released}} from Tragic Kingdom was [...] "Just a Girl", which details Gwen Stefani's exasperation with female stereotypes and her father's concerned reaction to her driving home late from her boyfriend's house. It peaked at number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 10 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song also charted on the UK Singles Chart, where its original release peaked at number 38 and its reissue at number three.

It reached number five on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, number 11 on the Billboard Top 40 Mainstream chart, and number 16 on the UK Singles Chart.|$|E
500|$|The aircraft's {{flight path}} took {{them around the}} south eastern corner of Malta and up the eastern coast of Sicily. The route was {{measured}} {{to ensure that the}} first planes arrived over the drop zones at 22:20. When the planes arrived off Sicily, they were supposed to stay [...] offshore until reaching the Simeto River, when they would head inland for the drop zones. Somehow, 33 aircraft strayed off course and approached an Allied convoy. The naval gunners had been warned to expect an air raid, and opened fire on the American and British aircraft. Two of the planes, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> unexpected anti-aircraft fire, collided and crashed into the sea. Another two were shot down, and nine were so badly shot up, with wounded crew and passengers, that they were forced to turn back towards their airfields in North Africa.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{explains}} why across Europe very few job matches are facilitated by public employment services (PES), {{looking at the}} existence of a double-sided asymmetric information problem on the labour market. It is argued that although a PES potentially reduces search costs, both employers and employees have strong incentives not to use the PES. The reason is that employers <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> ‘worst’ employees, and employees <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> ‘worst’ employers. Therefore PES get caught in a low-end equilibrium that is almost impossible to escape. The mechanisms leading to this low-end equilibrium are illustrated by means of qualitative interviews with 40 private employers in six European countries...|$|R

500|$|As cars {{continued}} {{to drive through}} the accident scene, the No. 77 car driven by Wheldon and the No. 12 driven by Power left the racing surface. Wheldon was racing at [...] when he came upon the scene, frantically <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> collision. Although {{he was able to}} considerably slow it down, Wheldon's car went airborne about [...] after running into the back of Kimball's and went barrel-rolling into the catch fence cockpit-first, causing his head to hit one of the poles. The No. 77 landed back on the racing surface having been sliced apart by the fence and slid to a stop next to the S.A.F.E.R. barrier. Power, meanwhile, went airborne when he ran over the back of Lloyd's car and struck the S.A.F.E.R. barrier. The car landed sideways on the track and rolled over, which caused the front wheel assembly to break; one of the front tires flew over Power's head and barely missed hitting him.|$|E
500|$|Stead {{finds that}} kids today {{are much less}} {{independent}} since her childhood. She wrote, [...] "rom age nine, my friends and I were on the streets, walking home, going to each other's houses, going to the store. I really {{wanted to write about}} that: the independence that's a little bit scary but also a really positive thing in a lot of ways. And I'm not sure that most kids have that today". Throughout the novel, Miranda and her friends often walk around town without any adults. They are even found working in a sandwich store at lunch and walking home from school while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> laughing man. While writing the novel, Stead hoped to show her sons the time period in which she lived, [...] "send them on a little time-travel journey of their own". Laura Miller of The New Yorker found that this lack of independence in today's youth is mainly {{due to the fact that}} kids now grow up with adults constantly watching them. Miller noted how, despite the lower crime rate in current times, the [...] "characters, middle-class middle school students, routinely walk around the Upper West Side by themselves, a rare freedom in today's city." ...|$|E
