The North Koreans sought to occupy a number of hill masses, most prominently Hill 902, known to South Koreans as Ka-san, for the ancient fortress situated atop it.|$|E
25|$|The Accounts were {{frequently}} {{used by the}} Ordinaries to refute personal slights and display their diligence and efforts. They stressed their manly fortitude and the firm manner in which <b>they</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>the</b> most hardened malefactors, repeatedly reminding the reader of their constant visits to the condemned {{in spite of their}} poor health and of the epidemic typhus which was common in 18th century prisons. They tended to exaggerate the bad behaviour of the criminals to emphasise how much they improved under the Ordinaries' care.|$|E
25|$|Ferdinand {{abandoned}} Goirle and Tilburg {{and marched}} with his army to Hilvarenbeek, where his troops crossed the Dommel river {{over the bridge}} of Halder, located a league from Den Bosch, and camped in Helmond, Neerwert, Heutsingben, and Rogelen. He ordered the Marquis Sigismondo Sfondrati to cross the Meuse through the bridge of Gennep with some companies and wend to Venlo, where he arrived the next day. By then the garrison had been warned, but Ferdinand decided to invest the town and entrusted this task to the Marquis of Sfondrati. <b>They</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>the</b> governor of Venlo, Nicolaas van Brederode, a bastard of the noble family of van Brederode who has at his disposition 15 companies of infantry and some cavalry troops amounting {{to a total of}} 1,000 or 1,200 men.|$|E

25|$|The Roman force {{stationed}} at the pass, with no Fabius to restrain them, deserted their posts {{at the head of}} the pass to attack what they thought was the main Carthaginian army trying to outflank their position and escape across the saddle. As soon as the Romans left their position, Hannibal's main army left camp, with the African infantry leading, the cavalry, the baggage train and the cattle herds marching in line after them, and Celts and Iberian infantry guarding the rear. The Carthaginian army moved through the pass unmolested, as Fabius did not challenge them. The Roman force attacking the saddle was bewildered when <b>they</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>the</b> lights on the saddle. The cattle ran amok, breaking their lines, the Carthaginian spearmen ambushed them, and a wild melee ensued. As dawn broke to make matters clear, a group of Iberian infantry was seen scaling the saddle walls to join the ongoing pandemonium on the saddle. The Iberians, being experts in mountain warfare, engaged the now scattered Roman soldiers and killed over 1,000 of their number, and managed to rescue the Carthaginian camp followers, the spearmen guard and some of the cattle well before the main Roman army could intervene.|$|E

In the summer the Byzantine Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos sent troops under the commander Saktikios to repel another Bulgarian raid at {{the outskirts of}} the Byzantine capital. The Byzantines stormed the Bulgarian camp but were defeated when <b>they</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>the</b> main Bulgarian forces.

In the process, <b>they</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>the</b> Time-Displaced Original X-Men, who had tracked down Jimmy after he was detected by Cerebro. Following a brief confrontation against the X-Men and Jimmy, during which Marvel Girl learned of Miss Sinister's involvement, the New Marauders were ordered by their superior to leave.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "battle" [...] {{was really}} {{more of a}} running gun fight, as the Comanche War Party {{was trying to get}} back to the Llano Estacado with a huge herd of horses and mules they had captured, a large number of firearms, and other plunder such as mirrors, liquor, and cloth. Volunteers from Gonzales under Mathew Caldwell and from Bastrop under Ed Burleson {{gathered}} to intercept the Comanches. [...] Joined by Ranger companies and armed settlers hastily assembled as militia from central and east Texas, <b>they</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>the</b> Indians at Good's Crossing on Plum Creek, near the modern town of Lockhart (about 27 miles south of Austin). Texas history says the Texans won this battle, although the Indians got away with most of their plunder and a great many of the captured horses and mules. [...] "Several hundred head of horses and mules were recaptured, as were also immense quantities of dry goods." [...] The Texans reported killing 80 Comanches (unusually heavy casualties for the Indians) in the fight, yet recovered only 12 Indian bodies. This was primarily due to the Comanche's tradition of gathering warrior corpses and burning them for burial.|$|E

60|$|The {{people had}} been drawing nearer and nearer and {{drinking}} {{in the words of}} their champion, who spoke in accents long disused, like one unaccustomed to converse except with the dead of many years ago. But his voice stirred their souls. <b>They</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>the</b> soldiers, not wholly without arms and ready to convert the very stones of the street into deadly weapons. Sir Edmund Andros looked at the old man; then he cast his hard and cruel eye over the multitude and beheld them burning with that lurid wrath so difficult to kindle or to quench, and again he fixed his gaze on the aged form which stood obscurely in an open space where neither friend nor foe had thrust himself. What were his thoughts he uttered no word which might discover, but, whether the oppressor were overawed by the Gray Champion's look or perceived his peril in the threatening attitude of the people, it is certain that he gave back and ordered his soldiers to commence a slow and guarded retreat. Before another sunset the governor and all that rode so proudly with him were prisoners, and long ere it was known that James had abdicated King William was proclaimed throughout New England.|$|E
