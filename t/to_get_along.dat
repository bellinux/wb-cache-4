5|$|A {{mostly white}} breed {{with either a}} smooth, rough or broken coat, it {{conforms}} to a narrower range of sizes than the Jack Russell. It is a feisty, energetic terrier, suited to sports and able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>along</b> with children and other animals. It has a range of breed-related health issues, mainly relating to eye disorders.|$|E
5|$|Although {{happy in}} the company of others, they are fine if left alone. Sealyham Terriers are suited for both the town and country. They can be stubborn, vocal, and boisterous but also full of personality. While they make for loyal family companions, they can be trained to be working dogs, making them {{excellent}} mousers or ratters. They can also be taught as a puppy <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>along</b> with other animals, including cats and birds.|$|E

5|$|Discontent {{against the}} king grew, however, and {{eventually}} affected also Edmund. The antagonism was largely caused by Edward's preference {{for his new}} favourites, Hugh Despenser the Younger and his father. In 1326, Edmund joined a rebellion led by Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer, whereby Edward II was deposed. Edmund failed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>along</b> with the new administration, and in 1330 he was caught planning a new rebellion, and executed.|$|E
5|$|Josquin {{probably}} {{remained in}} the service of Louis XII until 1503, when Duke Ercole I of Ferrara hired him for the chapel there. One of the rare mentions of Josquin's personality survives from this time. Prior to hiring Josquin, one of Duke Ercole's assistants recommended that he hire Heinrich Isaac instead, since Isaac was easier <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>along</b> with, more companionable, was more willing to compose on demand, and would cost significantly less (120 ducats vs. 200). Ercole, however, chose Josquin.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{was married}} twice, divorcing {{his first wife}} in acrimonious circumstances, and had a {{reputation}} for infidelity. His relationships with other players were difficult; team-mates and opponents alike found him hard <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>along</b> with. He was unsuccessful in business dealings and failed to establish a successful career once he retired from cricket. He moved to South Africa in the 1950s in an attempt to start a business, but this came to nothing. As a result, he and his family struggled financially. Shortly after beginning a career as a sports administrator, he was involved in a serious car crash in 1960 which left him frail. He {{died of a heart attack}} in 1965.|$|E

5|$|A {{short while}} {{later at the}} Andronikov Monastery, a {{messenger}} arrives from Moscow to ask Andrei for his assistance in decorating the Annunciation Cathedral with Theophanes the Greek. Both Daniil and Kirill are agitated by the recognition that Andrei receives. Daniil refuses to accompany Andrei and reproaches him for accepting Theophanes’ offer without considering his fellows, but soon repents of his temper and tearfully wishes Andrei well when the younger monk comes {{to say goodbye to}} his friend. Kirill is jealous of Andrei and in a fit of anger, decides to leave the monastery for the secular world, throwing accusations of greed in the face of his fellow monks, who also dismiss him. Kirill stumbles out of the monastery into the snowy countryside and is pursued by his dog, but Kirill savagely beats it with his walking stick and leaves it for dead. Andrei leaves for Moscow with his young apprentice Foma (Mikhail Kononov). Foma is another creative character, representing the light-hearted and practical-minded commercial artist. Still he seems to be contemplative enough <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>along</b> with Andrei.|$|E
5|$|Among other {{inhabitants}} of London are 10,000 red foxes, {{so that there}} are now 16 foxes for every square mile (2.6 square kilometres) of London. These urban foxes are noticeably bolder than their country cousins, sharing the pavement with pedestrians and raising cubs in people's backyards. Foxes have even sneaked into the Houses of Parliament, where one was found asleep on a filing cabinet. Another broke into the grounds of Buckingham Palace, reportedly killing some of Queen ElizabethII's prized pink flamingos. Generally, however, foxes and city folk appear <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>along.</b> A survey in 2001 by the London-based Mammal Society found that 80 percent of 3,779 respondents who volunteered to keep a diary of garden mammal visits liked having them around. This sample cannot be taken to represent Londoners as a whole.|$|E
5|$|However, Hornsby {{was often}} hard <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>along</b> with, {{a major reason}} he changed teams so {{frequently}} {{in the last decade}} of his career. He usually left due to falling out with the front office. Most of the players he managed did not like him due to his insistence that others follow his lifestyle, although some (like Woody English and Clint Courtney) did. Hornsby never played cards, but he did bet frequently on horse races, and he lost more than he won. His gambling was often a factor in his dismissal from a team. By most contemporary accounts, he was at least as mean and nasty as Cobb, who was known in his time for his aggressive attitude and dirty play. He never went to movies or read books, convinced that it would harm a batter's eyesight, and he never smoked or drank.|$|E
50|$|Animals that {{thrive in}} Joshua Tree often have special adaptations {{for dealing with}} limited water and high summer temperatures. The smaller mammals and all {{reptiles}} take refuge from the heat underground. Desert mammals make more efficient use of their bodies’ water supply than does the human body. Reptiles are physiologically adapted <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>along</b> with little water, and birds can fly to water sources {{when they need to}} drink. Nevertheless, the springs and seeps in the park are necessary to the survival of many animals.|$|R

Tom returns to the Snakehole Lounge to close his tab, where he meets the bartender, Lucy (Natalie Morales), who makes fun of his efforts to pick up women. The two get along and Lucy gives Tom her phone number, to his immense pleasure. Leslie decides to apologize to Ben, and he invites her out for a beer. As they finally start <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>along,</b> Leslie realizes Ben was the mayor {{of a small town}} called Partridge, Minnesota. It was national news because he was only 18 when elected, and he promptly drove the entire government into the ground. Ben became a state auditor to prove he can be responsible and restart his political career. Later, at the parks department budget meeting, Chris and Ben reveal Pawnee's budget crisis was far worse than previously thought and that the Pawnee government will shut down until further notice, horrifying Leslie and delighting Ron.|$|E
5|$|Many historians {{attribute}} the Confederacy's weaknesses {{to the poor}} leadership of Davis. His preoccupation with detail, reluctance to delegate responsibility, lack of popular appeal, feuds with powerful state governors and generals, favoritism toward old friends, inability <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>along</b> with people who disagreed with him, neglect of civil matters in favor of military ones, and resistance to public opinion all worked against him. Historians agree he was a much less effective war leader than his Union counterpart Abraham Lincoln. After Davis was captured in 1865, {{he was accused of}} treason and imprisoned at Fort Monroe. He was never tried and was released after two years. While not disgraced, Davis had been displaced in ex-Confederate affection after the war by his leading general, Robert E. Lee. Davis wrote a memoir entitled The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, which he completed in 1881. By the late 1880s, he began to encourage reconciliation, telling Southerners to be loyal to the Union. Ex-Confederates came to appreciate his role in the war, seeing him as a Southern patriot, and he became a hero of the Lost Cause in the post-Reconstruction South.|$|E
5|$|The White Stag Leadership Development Program's methods {{address all}} of the areas the studies identified. Mentored and coached by adults, the youth staff develop, plan and {{implement}} the week-long summer camp programs. They develop skills in research, writing, planning, and evaluation. Using the outdoors, they practice learning activities, games, and outdoor skills required {{to live in a}} camping environment. They learn <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>along</b> with and other counsel youth from different backgrounds. They study eleven specific skills of leadership and practice presenting them to one another before summer camp, when they present these learning sessions to the participants. The youth, led and mentored by adults, work together with other youth they have never met, forming new relationships and learning to connect and cooperate. They learn basic group membership skills required in work life, like communication and planning, and plan and implement their leadership skills in their home community. They learn and practice problem-solving and counseling skills, how groups form and grow, and planning skills. They learn and rehearse various kinds of communications skills, how to represent their group—both with and without the group's input—and how to work effectively with others.|$|E
