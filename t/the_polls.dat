30|$|If <b>the</b> <b>polling</b> fails, then <b>the</b> AP has to {{wait for}} <b>the</b> maximum <b>polling</b> cycle before polling again, because it must be sure {{that it will not}} collide with a {{possible}} ongoing transmission.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>poll</b> is {{especially}} important in riding, as correct flexion at <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> joint {{is a sign that}} the horse is properly on the bit. Over-flexion, with <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> lowered and <b>the</b> neck bent at a cervical vertebra farther down the neck, is usually a sign that the horse is either evading contact or that the rider is trying to pull the horse onto the bit, rather than correctly ride from behind. In classical dressage, <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> should always be the highest point on the horse when the horse is on the bit. The horse is always relaxed over <b>the</b> <b>poll,</b> giving it a relaxed look when going about its job. When, for example, the third vertebra (C3) is the highest point on the neck, rather than <b>the</b> <b>poll,</b> it is a clear sign of incorrect work.|$|R
5|$|The Brazilian {{constitution}} of 1988 {{called for a}} general vote on {{the restoration of the}} monarchy, which was held in 1993. The royalists went to <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> divided, with the press indicating there were actually two princes aspiring to the Brazilian throne (Dom Luiz de Orleans e Bragança and Dom João Henrique); this created some confusion among the voters. Voting tickets further divided the electorate by placing one box for a presidential republic on the ballot and four for a monarchy. Additional anti-monarchial sentiment was generated by several aggressive television commercials claiming that a vote for monarchy would be a vote for the return of slavery for blacks and a loss of Brazil's recent return to democracy after decades of military dictatorship. This result was a loss for the monarchists at <b>the</b> <b>polls.</b>|$|E

Their position in <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> climbed with each opponent they defeated. They beat Duke as the No. 25 team, Georgia Tech as the No. 23 team, North Carolina as the No. 20 team and No. 23 Miami as the No. 16 team. The Miami victory clinched Tech the division championship and a slot in the ACC championship game, but the Hokies still won their final previously scheduled game, the annual Commonwealth Cup rivalry against Virginia.|$|E
25|$|Entropy is {{a measure}} of unpredictability of the state, or equivalently, of its average {{information}} content. To get an intuitive understanding of these terms, consider the example of a political poll. Usually, such <b>polls</b> happen because <b>the</b> outcome of <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> is not already known. In other words, the outcome of <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> is relatively unpredictable, and actually performing <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> and learning <b>the</b> results gives some new information; these are just different ways of saying that the a priori entropy of <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> results is large. Now, consider the case that <b>the</b> same <b>poll</b> is performed a second time shortly after <b>the</b> first <b>poll.</b> Since <b>the</b> result of <b>the</b> first <b>poll</b> is already known, the outcome of <b>the</b> second <b>poll</b> can be predicted well and the results should not contain much new information; in this case the a priori entropy of <b>the</b> second <b>poll</b> result is small relative to that of the first.|$|R

5|$|After the {{violence}} of November 4, the Indianapolis Merchant's Association and other business leaders petitioned Governor Ralston to call out the Indiana National Guard. Members of both parties accused the union leaders of trying to prevent their voters from reaching <b>the</b> <b>polls.</b> The riots made national news and public leaders began to consider them an embarrassment to the state. Union leaders informed the Governor that calling out the guard would only cause them to escalate the riot and lead to more bloodshed.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} June 2013, Labor's {{standing}} in <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> had worsened, and the Coalition had been leading in most opinion polls for two years; one poll in early June showed that Labor would be reduced to as few as 40 seats after the next election. With a general election due later that year, even some staunch Gillard supporters began to believe that Labor faced almost certain defeat if Gillard continued as leader. According to the ABC's Barrie Cassidy, the question was not whether Gillard would be ousted as Labor leader, but when the ousting would take place.|$|E

However, in common usage, many horsemen refer to <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> joint, between <b>the</b> atlas (C1) and skull as <b>the</b> <b>poll.</b> <b>The</b> area at the joint has a slight depression, and is a sensitive location. Thus, because the crownpiece of a bridle passes over <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> joint, a rider can indirectly exert pressure on <b>the</b> horse's <b>poll</b> by means of the reins, bit, and bridle.|$|R
5|$|During {{the general}} election, Humphrey faced former Vice President Richard Nixon of New York, the Republican Party nominee.
