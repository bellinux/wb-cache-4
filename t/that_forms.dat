5|$|Carboniferous Period (359–299 {{million years}} ago) rocks are {{represented}} by the Carboniferous Limestone <b>that</b> <b>forms</b> the Mendip Hills, rising abruptly out of the flat landscape of the Somerset Levels and Moors. The limestones are very fossiliferous, and contain evidence of the abundant marine life that existed {{at the time of}} their creation, including fossil crinoids (sea-lilies), corals and brachiopods.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{emulsion}} has a {{place within}} each crystal where LIs are formed preferentially. They are called [...] "sensitivity centers." [...] Emulsions <b>that</b> <b>form</b> LIs in the interior are called internal(ly) sensitive emulsions, and those <b>that</b> <b>form</b> LI on the surface are called surface sensitive emulsions. The sensitivity type largely reflects the site of very shallow electron traps <b>that</b> <b>form</b> latent images effectively.|$|R
50|$|The {{sub-family}} {{of rocks}} <b>that</b> <b>form</b> from volcanic lava are called igneous volcanic rocks (to differentiate them from igneous rocks <b>that</b> <b>form</b> from magma below the surface, called igneous plutonic rocks).|$|R
25|$|Generally speaking, more mafic magmas, such {{as those}} <b>that</b> <b>form</b> basalt, are hotter and less viscous than more silica-rich magmas, {{such as those}} <b>that</b> <b>form</b> rhyolite. Low {{viscosity}} leads to gentler, less explosive eruptions.|$|R
5|$|Chetro Ketl's {{walls were}} {{constructed}} using three bulk materials: stone, clay-sand, and water. Two types of stone were used: a hard gray-brown tabular sandstone <b>that</b> <b>forms</b> the bench above Chaco Canyon's cliffs, and a softer, tan, massively bedded sandstone <b>that</b> <b>forms</b> the cliffs themselves. Chacoans preferred the harder, tabular stone {{as it was}} easier to shape, but much of it had to be dug up and levered out of the ground with wooden poles. Because the massive tan stone of the cliff faces was easier to procure, but much more difficult to work, the Chacoans probably used it only after the more easily quarried gray-brown stone beds had been depleted.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is a {{relatively}} rare neoplasm that is classified as an adenocarcinoma (a cancer <b>that</b> <b>forms</b> glands or secretes significant amounts of mucins). It has an annual incidence rate of 1–2 cases per 100,000 in the Western world, but rates of cholangiocarcinoma have been rising worldwide {{over the past few}} decades.|$|E
5|$|Ctenophores have no brain {{or central}} nervous system, but instead have a nerve net (rather like a cobweb) <b>that</b> <b>forms</b> a ring round {{the mouth and}} is densest near {{structures}} such as the comb rows, pharynx, tentacles (if present) and the sensory complex furthest from the mouth.|$|E
50|$|The magmas <b>that</b> <b>formed</b> Parinacota and Pomerape are {{considered}} to be a group distinct from these <b>that</b> <b>formed</b> older volcanic centres in the region, but also distinct from the magmas <b>that</b> <b>formed</b> the subsidiary vent of Pomerape and the Ajata cones; these tend to be more mafic. In turn, the younger and older Ajata cone lavas have different compositions, one having a high quantity of strontium and the other a low one.|$|R

5|$|In {{physics and}} fluid mechanics, a Blasius {{boundary}} layer (named after Paul Richard Heinrich Blasius) describes the steady two-dimensional {{laminar boundary layer}} <b>that</b> <b>forms</b> on a semi-infinite plate which is held parallel to a constant unidirectional flow. Falkner and Skan later generalized Blasius' solution to wedge flow (Falkner–Skan boundary layer), i.e. flows in which the plate is not parallel to the flow.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{the thermal}} {{denaturation}} process of DNA provides insight into other biological processes that involve denaturation. Examining bubbles in DNA investigates the intermediate states {{that exist in}} this important melting transition. Information can be gathered by studying the impact {{the location of a}} defect that will nucleate a bubble has on the amount of bubble states <b>that</b> <b>form.</b> A relationship exists where the closer the defect is to the middle, the less bubble states <b>that</b> <b>form.</b> Further investigation found that the nature of the defect appeared to impact the amount of bubble states <b>that</b> <b>formed...</b>|$|R
5|$|Neuroblastoma (NB) {{is a type}} {{of cancer}} <b>that</b> <b>forms</b> in certain types of nerve tissue.

5|$|A {{pathology}} {{has been}} identified on the tail of Apatosaurus, caused by a growth defect. Two caudal vertebrae are seamlessly fused along the entire articulating surface of the bone, including the arches of the neural spines. This defect might {{have been caused by}} the lack or inhibition of the substance <b>that</b> <b>forms</b> intervertebral disks or joints. It has been proposed that the whips could have been used in combat, but the tails of diplodocids were quite light and narrow compared to Shunosaurus and mamenchisaurids, and thus to injure another animal with the tail would severely injure the tail itself.|$|E
