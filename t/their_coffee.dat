5|$|Rwandans {{have been}} growing coffee since colonial times, but until 1999 the product was classed below Grade C, making it unsalable on the global markets. The farmers {{did not have the}} means to wash and prepare <b>their</b> <b>coffee</b> {{cherries}} to specifications in a timely manner. Buyers paid US$0.33 per kilogram, a price that kept the farmers poor.|$|E

25|$|By 1920, small growers {{had done}} more to develop the {{industry}} than any other group. For many decades they planted, processed and sold <b>their</b> <b>coffee</b> virtually unnoticed by Colombia's government. On the other hand, the large growers began voicing their opinions and grievances against the Government through the Agricultural Society of Colombia (Sociedad de Agricultores de Colombia). By {{the start of the}} 20th century, there were about 750 coffee farms and plantations. Between 1910 and 1932, this number had increased to more than 150,000 farms and plantations, according to the Coffee Census of 1932.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the last}} 50 years, coffee {{production}} in India {{has grown by}} over 15 percent. From 1991, economic liberalisation took place in India, and the industry took full advantage of this and cheaper labour costs of production. In 1993, a monumental Internal Sales Quota (ISQ) made {{the first step in}} liberalising the coffee industry by entitling coffee farmers to sell 30% of their production within India. This was further amended in 1994 when the Free Sale Quota (FSQ) permitted large and small scale growers to sell between 70% and 100% of <b>their</b> <b>coffee</b> either domestically or internationally. A final amendment in September 1996 saw the liberalisation of coffee for all growers in the country and a freedom to sell their produce wherever they wished.|$|E

25|$|In 1870 Brazil's {{trade with}} America was valued at about 31 million dollars while the {{combined}} trade {{of all the}} South American countries was valued at about $29million. Brazil was a significant producer of coffee {{and because of this}} the United States imported about four times as much as it exported to Brazil. In 1885 Brazil was producing more than one half of the world's supply of coffee. Brazil's trade in 1890 was more than $71million while that of Argentina and Chile was $14million and $6million respectively. Soon after 1896, the production of coffee started to surpass consumption and prices began to fall in Brazil. Brazil then stored <b>their</b> <b>coffee</b> instead of selling all of it, and when there was bad season of coffee production they would use what they had previously stored from the year before.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, the {{government}} of Puerto Rico expropriated most of the lands of Buena Vista, {{as a result of}} a new law to provide land to local farmers. Only 87 acres of land remained with the Vives, including the manor house and the water channel system. These were acquired by the Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico in 1984. In 1986, the Trust restored the hacienda to much of its past glory and turned it into a museum. It opened in 1987. The museum has operated continuously for 23 years. It is the only such museum in Puerto Rico. In 1988, the Trust entirely reconstructed the coffee mill to its 1892 look. While the Vives family had rebuilt <b>their</b> <b>coffee</b> mill after 1928, the Trust chose to reconstruct an approximation of the earlier coffee mill of 1892.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{argue that}} Fairtrade harms all non-Fairtrade farmers. Fairtrade claims that its farmers are paid higher prices and are given special advice on {{increasing}} yields and quality. Economists state that, {{if this is}} indeed so, Fairtrade farmers will increase production. As the demand for coffee is highly elastic, a small increase in supply means a large fall in market price, so perhaps a million Fairtrade farmers get a higher price and 24 million others get a substantially lower price. Critics quote the example of farmers in Vietnam being paid over the world price in the 1980s, planting lots of coffee, then flooding the world market in the 1990s. The Fairtrade minimum price means that when the world market price collapses, it is the non-Fairtrade farmers, particularly the poorest, who have to cut down <b>their</b> <b>coffee</b> trees. This argument is supported by mainstream economists, not just free marketers.|$|E

25|$|Viennese cafés have an {{extremely}} long and distinguished history {{that dates back}} centuries, and the caffeine addictions of some famous historical patrons of the oldest are something of a local legend. These coffee houses are unique to Vienna and many cities have unsuccessfully sought to copy them. Some people consider cafés as their extended living room where nobody will be bothered if they spend hours reading a newspaper while enjoying <b>their</b> <b>coffee.</b> Traditionally, the coffee comes {{with a glass of}} water. Viennese cafés claim to have invented the process of filtering coffee from booty captured after the second Turkish siege in 1683. Viennese cafés claim that when the invading Turks left Vienna, they abandoned hundreds of sacks of coffee beans. The Polish King John III Sobieski, the commander of the anti-Turkish coalition of Poles, Germans, and Austrians, gave Franz George Kolschitzky (Polish – Franciszek Jerzy Kulczycki) some of this coffee as a reward for providing information that allowed him to defeat the Turks. Kolschitzky then opened Vienna's first coffee shop. Julius Meinl set up a modern roasting plant in the same premises where the coffee sacks were found, in 1891.|$|E
25|$|The {{producers}} {{wanted to}} have a gathering place outside of home and work where the characters could meet. After a trip to Seattle, and seeing the many burgeoning coffee shops, the production designer suggested to producers that they use a coffee shop. Unlike many of the relatively modern coffee shop designs prevalent in Seattle, the production designer opted for a more warm and inviting style which would appear more established and traditional. Stools were specifically omitted to avoid any similarity to the bar on Cheers. Several Los Angeles coffee shops were used for reference. A bookcase was added on the back wall, suggesting patrons could grab a book and read while they enjoyed <b>their</b> <b>coffee.</b> The show used three versions of the interior set depending on how much space other sets for each episode required. If there was not space for the full set, a smaller version that omitted the tables closest to the audience could be used. If there wasn't space for that set, a small back section {{of the back of the}} cafe at the top of the steps could be set up under the audience bleachers. A set was also used on occasion for the exterior patio.|$|E

McCartney was initially reluctant to try it, but eventually did so in late 1966. He became the first Beatle to discuss LSD publicly, declaring in a magazine interview that [...] "it opened my eyes" [...] and [...] "made me a better, more honest, more tolerant member of society".|$|E

500|$|Newspapers and {{journals}} {{around the world}} speculated that Brazil was acting {{as a proxy for}} a naval power which would take possession of the two dreadnoughts soon after completion, as they did not believe that a previously insignificant geopolitical power would contract for such powerful armament. The evidence for a sale seemed strong, as Brazilian attempts to float a multi-million-dollar loan against the value of <b>their</b> <b>coffee</b> crop in 1908 were unsuccessful. With three dreadnoughts planned (including the upcoming [...] ), a Spanish naval journal stated [...] "it was only natural that rumors [...] to circulate supporting the argument that Brazil acted as an intermediary for some great power which would acquire them before they terminate their construction." [...] Various British papers speculated that either the Germans, Japanese, or Americans were actually buying the ships, while naval experts in Germany thought the Americans, British, or Japanese were going to take them over. On {{the other side of the}} Atlantic, some American papers theorized that the ships would be sold to the United Kingdom, Germany, or Japan.
