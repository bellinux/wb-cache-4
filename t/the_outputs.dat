5|$|Dataflow {{programming}} languages describe {{systems of}} operations on data streams, and {{the connections between}} <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> of some operations and the inputs of others. These languages can be convenient for describing repetitive data processing tasks, in which the same acyclically-connected collection of operations is applied to many data items. They can be executed as a parallel algorithm in which each operation is performed by a parallel process as soon as another set of inputs becomes available to it.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebellum}} modulates <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> {{of other}} brain systems, whether motor related or thought related, {{to make them}} certain and precise. Removal of the cerebellum does not prevent an animal from doing anything in particular, but it makes actions hesitant and clumsy. This precision is not built-in, but learned by trial and error. The muscle coordination learned while riding a bicycle {{is an example of}} a type of neural plasticity that may take place largely within the cerebellum. 10% of the brain's total volume consists of the cerebellum and 50% of all neurons are held within its structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{iterative}} algorithms were independently {{published in}} 1975–1976 by American physicist Eugene Salamin and Australian scientist Richard Brent. These avoid reliance on infinite series. An iterative algorithm repeats a specific calculation, each iteration using <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> from prior steps as its inputs, and produces a result in each step that converges {{to the desired}} value. The approach was actually invented over 160 years earlier by Carl Friedrich Gauss, {{in what is now}} termed the arithmetic–geometric mean method (AGM method) or Gauss–Legendre algorithm. As modified by Salamin and Brent, it is also referred to as the Brent–Salamin algorithm.|$|E
25|$|<b>Output</b> {{sink current}}: <b>The</b> <b>output</b> sink current is the maximum current allowed {{to sink into}} <b>the</b> <b>output</b> stage. Some {{manufacturers}} show <b>the</b> <b>output</b> voltage vs. <b>the</b> <b>output</b> sink current plot, which gives an idea of <b>the</b> <b>output</b> voltage when it is sinking current from another source into <b>the</b> <b>output</b> pin.|$|R
5000|$|This mirror uses {{feedback}} to raise <b>the</b> <b>output</b> impedance {{in such a}} way that <b>the</b> <b>output</b> transistor contributes collector current fluctuation noise to <b>the</b> <b>output.</b> All three transistors of the Wilson current mirror add noise to <b>the</b> <b>output.</b>|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{it is easy}} to {{see that}} <b>the</b> <b>output</b> of HybN is {{identical}} to <b>the</b> <b>output</b> of S, and <b>the</b> <b>output</b> of Hyb 0 is identical to the real view view_A. Because there are at most polynomial hybrids in this experiment, we can conclude that <b>the</b> <b>output</b> of S is indistinguishable from <b>the</b> <b>output</b> of <b>the</b> real interaction.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>outputs</b> of a {{structural}} alignment are a superposition {{of the atomic}} coordinate sets and a minimal {{root mean square deviation}} (RMSD) between the structures. The RMSD of two aligned structures indicates their divergence from one another. Structural alignment can be complicated by the existence of multiple protein domains within {{one or more of the}} input structures, because changes in relative orientation of the domains between two structures to be aligned can artificially inflate the RMSD.|$|E
5|$|In vertebrates, {{the part}} of the brain that plays the {{greatest}} role is the hypothalamus, a small region at the base of the forebrain whose size does not reflect its complexity or the importance of its function. The hypothalamus is a collection of small nuclei, most of which are involved in basic biological functions. Some of these functions relate to arousal or to social interactions such as sexuality, aggression, or maternal behaviors; but many of them relate to homeostasis. Several hypothalamic nuclei receive input from sensors located in the lining of blood vessels, conveying information about temperature, sodium level, glucose level, blood oxygen level, and other parameters. These hypothalamic nuclei send output signals to motor areas that can generate actions to rectify deficiencies. Some of <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> also go to the pituitary gland, a tiny gland attached to the brain directly underneath the hypothalamus. The pituitary gland secretes hormones into the bloodstream, where they circulate throughout the body and induce changes in cellular activity.|$|E
5|$|Transversal {{filters are}} not usually {{associated}} with passive implementations but the concept {{can be found in}} a Wiener and Lee patent from 1935 which describes a filter consisting of a cascade of all-pass sections. <b>The</b> <b>outputs</b> of the various sections are summed in the proportions needed to result in the required frequency function. This works by the principle that certain frequencies will be in, or close to antiphase, at different sections and will tend to cancel when added. These are the frequencies rejected by the filter and can produce filters with very sharp cut-offs. This approach did not find any immediate applications, and is not common in passive filters. However, the principle finds many applications as an active delay line implementation for wide band discrete-time filter applications such as television, radar and high-speed data transmission.|$|E
5000|$|The {{shrinking}} generator takes {{a different}} approach. Two LFSRs are used, both clocked regularly. If <b>the</b> <b>output</b> of <b>the</b> first LFSR is [...] "1", <b>the</b> <b>output</b> of <b>the</b> second LFSR becomes <b>the</b> <b>output</b> of <b>the</b> generator. If <b>the</b> first LFSR <b>outputs</b> [...] "0", however, <b>the</b> <b>output</b> of <b>the</b> second is discarded, and no bit is <b>output</b> by <b>the</b> generator. This mechanism suffers from timing attacks on the second generator, since the speed of <b>the</b> <b>output</b> is variable {{in a manner that}} depends on the second generator's state. This can be alleviated by buffering <b>the</b> <b>output.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{activation}} function of <b>the</b> <b>output</b> neuron is also different; <b>the</b> <b>output</b> neuron is always activated by the linear function y = u, where u {{is the potential}} of <b>the</b> <b>output</b> neuron calculated as the scalar product of the weight vector v and <b>the</b> <b>output</b> vector o.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>outputs</b> {{that can}} be {{realized}} from the D-17B computer are binary, discrete, single character, phase register status, telemetry, and voltage outputs. Binary outputs are computer generated levels of +1 or −1 available on the binary output lines.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} example {{illustrates how}} a Boolean network can model a GRN together with its gene products (<b>the</b> <b>outputs)</b> and the substances {{from the environment}} that affect it (the inputs). Stuart Kauffman was amongst the first biologists to use the metaphor of Boolean networks to model genetic regulatory networks.|$|E

50|$|Dynamic logic {{requires}} a minimum clock rate fast enough that <b>the</b> <b>output</b> state of each dynamic gate is used or refreshed before the charge in <b>the</b> <b>output</b> capacitance leaks out {{enough to cause}} the digital state of <b>the</b> <b>output</b> to change, during {{the part of the}} clock cycle that <b>the</b> <b>output</b> is not being actively driven.|$|R
25|$|The F-function {{splits the}} 32-bit input into four eight-bit {{quarters}}, {{and uses the}} quarters as input to the S-boxes. The S-boxes accept 8-bit input and produce 32-bit output. <b>The</b> <b>outputs</b> are added modulo 232 and XORed to produce the final 32-bit output (see image in the upper right corner).|$|E
25|$|Combined {{cardiac output}} (CCO) {{is the sum}} of <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> of the right and left sides of the heart. It is a useful {{measurement}} in fetal circulation, where cardiac outputs {{from both sides of the}} heart work partly in parallel by the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus, which directly supply the systemic circulation.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the primal}} and the dual {{problems}} {{make use of}} the same matrix. In the primal space, this matrix expresses the consumption of physical quantities of inputs necessary to produce set quantities of outputs. In the dual space, it expresses the creation of the economic values associated with <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> from set input unit prices.|$|E

25|$|By {{assigning}} a softmax activation function, a {{generalization of}} the logistic function, on the output {{layer of the}} neural network (or a softmax component in a component-based neural network) for categorical target variables, <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> {{can be interpreted as}} posterior probabilities. This is very useful in classification as it gives a certainty measure on classifications.|$|E
25|$|Dynamic FBA {{attempts}} {{to add the}} ability for models to change over time, thus in some ways avoiding the strict steady state condition of pure FBA. Typically the technique involves running an FBA simulation, changing the model based on <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> of that simulation, and rerunning the simulation. By repeating this process an element of feedback is achieved over time.|$|E
25|$|The {{core of the}} LZB route center, {{or central}} controller, {{consists}} of a 2-of-3 computer system with two computers connected to <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> and an extra for standby. Each computer has its own power supply and is in its own frame. All 3 computers receive and process inputs and interchange their outputs and important intermediate results. If one disagrees it is disabled and the standby computer takes its place.|$|E

30|$|All flux along <b>the</b> <b>output</b> {{channel is}} {{collected}} in <b>the</b> <b>output</b> node, i.e., given a particular {{state of the}} switch nodes, the flux into <b>the</b> <b>output</b> node is <b>the</b> sum of the fluxes consumed from the left.|$|R
25|$|It can {{be shown}} that for <b>the</b> <b>output</b> of Markov {{information}} sources, Kolmogorov complexity {{is related to the}} entropy of the information source. More precisely, the Kolmogorov complexity of <b>the</b> <b>output</b> of a Markov information source, normalized by the length of <b>the</b> <b>output,</b> converges almost surely (as the length of <b>the</b> <b>output</b> goes to infinity) to the entropy of the source.|$|R
25|$|Normally the {{steering}} shaft {{is connected to}} the engine directly, instead of the output from the transmission. This means it spins at a relatively narrow range of RPM compared to the main drive shaft. The steering shaft is split into two output shafts through a clutch system that allows <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> to spin forward, backward, or not at all. An idler reverses the direction on one side, so they always spin in opposite directions.|$|E
25|$|The step {{response}} {{of a system}} in a given initial state consists of the time evolution of its outputs when its control inputs are Heaviside step functions. In electronic engineering and control theory, {{step response}} is the time behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> of a general system when its inputs change from zero to one {{in a very short}} time. The concept can be extended to the abstract mathematical notion of a dynamical system using an evolution parameter.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the primary}} ways to improve energy {{conservation}} in buildings is to use an energy audit. An energy audit is an inspection and analysis of energy use and flows for energy conservation in a building, process or system {{to reduce the amount}} of energy input into the system without negatively affecting <b>the</b> <b>output(s).</b> This is normally accomplished by trained professionals and can be part of some of the national programs discussed above. In addition, recent development of smartphone apps enable homeowners to complete relatively sophisticated energy audits themselves.|$|E
