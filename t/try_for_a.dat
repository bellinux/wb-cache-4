5|$|In 1855, Tchaikovsky's father funded {{private lessons}} with Rudolph Kündinger and {{questioned}} {{him about a}} musical career for his son. While impressed with the boy's talent, Kündinger said he saw nothing to suggest a future composer or performer. He later admitted that his assessment was also based on his own negative experiences as a musician in Russia and his unwillingness for Tchaikovsky to be treated likewise. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then <b>try</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> post in the Ministry of Justice.|$|E
5|$|Music {{was not a}} {{priority}} at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then <b>try</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> post in the Ministry of Justice.|$|E

Virginia Tech didn't score in the first half, and Auburn managed just threefield goals, {{including}} one taken inside the Virginia Tech red zone after Auburn failed to score a touchdown from the Tech one-yard line. Tech also {{had a chance to}} score a touchdown from inside their opponent's one-yard line, but like Auburn, failed to do so. The Hokies elected to <b>try</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> touchdown rather than a field goal on fourth down, but were stopped. At halftime, Auburn had a 9–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Bernhard Mahler {{supported}} his son's ambitions for a music career, and {{agreed that the}} boy should <b>try</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> place at the Vienna Conservatory. The young Mahler was auditioned by the renowned pianist Julius Epstein, and accepted for 1875–76. He made good progress in his piano studies with Epstein and won prizes {{at the end of}} each of his first two years. For his final year, 1877–78, he concentrated on composition and harmony under Robert Fuchs and Franz Krenn. Few of Mahler's student compositions have survived; most were abandoned when he became dissatisfied with them. He destroyed a symphonic movement prepared for an end-of-term competition, after its scornful rejection by the autocratic director Joseph Hellmesberger on the grounds of copying errors. Mahler may have gained his first conducting experience with the Conservatory's student orchestra, in rehearsals and performances, although it appears that his main role in this orchestra was as a percussionist.|$|E

25|$|He {{was very}} slow {{to move into}} {{first-class}} cricket. Cuttell's early cricket was played for the Accrington Club in the Lancashire League. Having been born in Yorkshire and his father William Cuttell having played {{for them in the}} 1860s, he decided to <b>try</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> place in the Yorkshire eleven. However, his form in a couple of matches against opposition that was not recognised as first-class was not encouraging, so that Willis returned to league cricket. From 1891 he shifted to the Nelson Club (later famous as where Ted McDonald played when qualifying for Lancashire) and proved himself the best bowler in league cricket. In 1895 he took 106 wickets for 8½ runs apiece and in 1893 as many as 118 wickets fell to his bowling in league games.|$|E
25|$|After the {{formation}} of the National Government, Creech Jones at first went along with his TGWU colleague Ernest Bevin in joining the Socialist League. He was a leading figure in the National I.L.P. Affiliation Committee, which sought to persuade the Independent Labour Party to continue its affiliation to the Labour Party, but when the fight was lost, he resigned from the ILP and joined the Labour Party directly. Initially unwilling to <b>try</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> seat in Parliament, it was reported to be his observation of events in Germany which persuaded him to change his mind and at the 1935 general election he won the constituency of Shipley as a Labour Party candidate; his election was helped by the Conservative vote being split between the official candidate and the sitting Member of Parliament (MP), who had been deselected.|$|E
25|$|About 75% of cats {{treated with}} {{chemotherapy}} for lymphoma go into remission. Unfortunately, {{after an initial}} remission, most cats experience a relapse, after which they have a median survival of 6 months. However, about one-third of cats treated with chemotherapy will survive more than 2 years after diagnosis; {{a small number of}} these cats may be cured of their disease. Untreated, most cats with lymphoma die within 4–6 weeks. Most cats tolerate their chemotherapy well, and fewer than 5% have severe side effects. Cats do not lose their fur from chemotherapy, though loss of whiskers is possible. Other side effects include low white blood cell count, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, or fatigue. These can typically be controlled well, and most cats have a good quality of life during treatment. If a cat relapses after attaining remission, the cat can be treated with different chemotherapy drugs to <b>try</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> second remission. The chances of a second remission are much lower than the chances of obtaining a first, and the second remission is often shorter than the first.|$|E

25|$|The {{main part}} of the game is to lead a Sim from the start of life to death. A Sim will be born when a female Sim and a male Sim <b>try</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> baby. The mother will spend 3 Sim days (each day lasts 24 minutes though time can be sped-up) {{pregnant}} before giving birth to a baby. Players can name the new Sim upon birth. The baby's appearance and personality will be based on the genetics of its parents (though the baby's appearance is hidden until it becomes a toddler). Babies can also be adopted by calling the social worker on the phone, even by single parents or same-gender couples. The baby will change into a toddler in 3 days, and 4 more days for the toddler to change into a child. After 8 days, the child grows into a teenager, and will live 15 days before changing into an adult. After 29 days, the Sim will become an elder. An elder will eventually die; the length of this final stage depends on the aspiration bar when they become an elder.|$|E
