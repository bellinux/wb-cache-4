5|$|The Fourth Amendment (Amendment IV) to the United States Constitution prohibits {{unreasonable}} {{searches and}} seizures. It requires governmental searches and seizures {{to be conducted}} only upon issuance of a warrant, judicially sanctioned by probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, particularly describing <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> searched and the persons or things to be seized. It {{is part of the}} Bill of Rights and was adopted in response to the abuse of the writ of assistance, a type of general search warrant issued by the British government, and a major source of tension in pre-Revolutionary America. The Fourth Amendment was introduced in Congress in 1789 by James Madison, along with the other amendments in the Bill of Rights, in response to Anti-Federalist objections to the new Constitution. Congress submitted the amendment to the states on September 28, 1789. By December 15, 1791, the necessary three-fourths of the states had ratified it. On March 1, 1792, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the amendment.|$|E
25|$|When the anticipatory warrant is {{predicated}} on a triggering condition, the Fourth Amendment requires that there is probable cause {{to believe that the}} triggering condition will occur, and that if it occurs, that there is a fair probability that the contraband will be found at <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> searched. In this case, the warrant application satisfied both conditions, based on the delivery of the tape as the triggering condition.|$|E

25|$|In this {{particular}} decision, which arose {{from a federal}} child pornography prosecution, the Court ruled that a warrant that was predicated on the undercover delivery of a videotape to the defendant's home, but did not state this on its face, was properly issued and executed because it described <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> searched and the objects to be seized, and the search was conducted after the delivery was made.

25|$|Back on Broadway, Arthur {{continued}} {{to appear in}} small plays that received little attention. Critics, however, {{continued to}} praise her in their reviews. It {{has been argued that}} in this period, Arthur developed confidence in her acting craft for the first time. On the contrast between films in Hollywood and plays in New York, Arthur commented:I don't think Hollywood is <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> yourself. The individual ought to find herself before coming to Hollywood. On the stage I found myself to be in a different world. The individual counted. The director encouraged me and I learned how to be myself.... I learned to face audiences and to forget them. To see the footlights and not to see them; to gauge the reactions of hundreds of people, and yet to throw myself so completely into a role that I was oblivious to their reaction.|$|E
25|$|State government: {{including}} police cars, fire engines, {{and other}} state government cars usually use a combination in the Maa-nnn series of plates for registration. These plates exclusively use the Maa-nnn combinations and their design has always mirrored that of general issue plates. The government plate series started at MZA-000 to MZZ-999, MYA-000 to MYZ-999, MXA-000 to MXZ-999, MWA-000 to MWZ-999 and MVA-000 to MVU-999. The original state government plates were identical in design to the general issue equivalents. With {{the release of the}} Victoria – Garden State plates in 1977, the green text on white background was replaced with red text on white for government applications. This colour scheme has remained ever since, even with the adoption of newer plate designs and slogans. In 1992, plates in the MVE-000 to MVU-999 series sported a Victoria – Drive Safely slogan as per the general issue plates of this time. With the switch in 1994 to the slogan, Victoria – On the Move, the plates started at MAA-000 having skipped from MVV-000 to MVZ-999. The design and slogan changed in 2000 to the Victoria – <b>The</b> <b>Place</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> type starting at MBE-000. Sometime between August 2013 and April 2015, the series continued from MCV-000 under the new slogan Vic – Stay Alert Stay Alive. From circa March 2016, Government red plates began to be produced with the Education State slogan from MCZ-000 onwards. Due to a supplier change, emergency service vehicles temporarily reverted to general issue plates (blue on white) in late 2016. The new plates appear to have a lighter shade of red and the new series began at MDA-000. As of September 2017, the series was up to MDD-000.|$|E

2500|$|The band visited Dingle, on Ireland's {{west coast}} and started writing new material. They {{stayed in a}} small house, {{described}} by Simpson as a [...] "little round house overlooking the sea". They then did some recording in a studio. The main recording sessions, though, happened in an old [...] "condemned" [...] studio in Westmeath, located in {{the central part of}} the country. Simpson found <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> [...] "laid-back" [...] and [...] "almost like a holiday home". The location was in a secluded area, quite distant from any civilization, with animals running around. This helped the band concentrate well without much distraction. The band stayed there for six weeks. Simpson felt the reason why producer Jacknife Lee was taking the band to different places was because he did not want them to get too comfortable with the surroundings. The songs were generally not written as a whole, but the band wrote them as they [...] "came". The writing process thus varied for each song; instead of spending excess time on one and overworking themselves, the band chose to work on another, often revisiting the song later. The band was also constantly changing song arrangements. Due to this, they found they had gotten a much clearer idea of which songs they would ultimately polish to possibly make the album. Simpson noted that the band had much more time to write and record this time, a luxury they had not enjoyed previously.|$|E
2500|$|Apart {{from the}} acts, {{the stars of}} the club were the patrons. Tender Trap patrons were {{generally}} regarded by the press of the day to be a cut above – articles often refer to their eccentric, period fashion sense and funky moves. The most loyal patrons were a group known as [...] "the Kids" [...] – the Captain, Tito, 'Tache, Glen, Peta, Ineke, Jodie, & Megan. Other colourful patrons included [...] "Lantern", the [...] "Dancing Partner", Mr. Tambourine Man, Quiet Dave, Disco Phil, and Bongo John. A teenage Hana Shimada, now a co-director of her own successful GoodGod Small Club in downtown Sydney, was a regular sight on the dance-floor. All club regulars were issued the prized [...] "Swingers" [...] membership cards. However, the door policy was deliberately inclusive – all types were welcome, young and old, straight and gay, the sophisticated, the sexy, and the downright spooky. Celebrities had to pay to get in – they included Leonardo DiCaprio, Princess Stephanie of Monaco, Russell Crow, Geoffrey Rush, numerous touring rockers such as Urge Overkill and Donovan Leitch. Only one celebrity was ever admitted free as a special guest – Lamonte McLemore, one of the founding members of the American popular music vocal group the 5th Dimension. Lamonte received star treatment, and was feted by young ladies at his own table. Lamonte smiled enigmatically as a room full of people danced wildly to the 5th Dimension hits, Up, Up and Away, and Puppet Man, 30 years after those records had first hit the charts. At its peak, and on long weekend holidays, the Tender Trap could be packed with 1200 patrons, the queue stretching down Darlinghurst Road, all in a building licensed to entertain 300. The crush added to the sense of wild occasion, but for those wanting a more laid-back experience, mid-winter Tender Trap was <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Caliphate lasted in {{the area}} until 1099, when the Christian Crusader Godfrey de Bouillon took Hebron and renamed it [...] "Castellion Saint Abraham". It was {{designated}} capital of the southern district of the Crusader Kingdom and given, in turn, as the fief of Saint Abraham, to Geldemar Carpinel, the bishop Gerard of Avesnes, Hugh of Rebecques, Walter Mohamet and Baldwin of Saint Abraham. [...] As a Frankish garrison of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, its defence was precarious being 'little more than an island in a Moslem ocean'. The Crusaders converted the mosque and the synagogue into a church. In 1106, an Egyptian campaign thrust into southern Palestine and almost succeeded the following year in wresting Hebron back from the Crusaders under Baldwin I of Jerusalem, who personally led the counter-charge to beat the Muslim forces off. In the year 1113 {{during the reign of}} Baldwin II of Jerusalem, according to Ali of Herat (writing in 1173), a certain part over the cave of Abraham had given way, and [...] "a number of Franks had made their entrance therein". And they discovered [...] "(the bodies) of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob", [...] "their shrouds having fallen to pieces, lying propped up against a wall...Then the King, after providing new shrouds, caused <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> closed once more".

Towards the end of the period of Crusader rule, in 1166 Maimonides visited Hebron and wrote,'On Sunday, 9 Marheshvan (17 October), I left Jerusalem for Hebron to kiss the tombs of my ancestors in the Cave. On that day, I stood in the cave and prayed, praise be to God, (in gratitude) for everything'.|$|E
