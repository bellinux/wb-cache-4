His results were sufficiently promising that he recommended further development to Commander Stanford C. Hooper. [...] In October, 1919 Commander Hooper instructed A. Crossley, an expert radio aid, to develop and test the concept {{on a larger scale}} at the New London Naval Base. Crossley installed a longer version of the cable that Marriott had designed. He used a wooden hulled launch for the first round of tests before moving to a steel-hulled submarine for later tests.

The generators produced direct current, which was used to signal the readiness of the mines. An interrupter was used to convert a portion of this current to AC which was used to fire the mines; the distinct current supply was a safety feature. The casemate also {{had a number of}} telephone lines, keeping it in touch with remotely located mine observation and fire-control positions, with the mine commander, and with the gun batteries and searchlights that covered the mine fields.

40|$|The {{transfer}} impedance Z/sub t/ of a cable is often {{assumed to be}} a characteristic of the shield only. We investigate the limits of this assumption by calculations and measurements. The first <b>test</b> <b>cable</b> was formed by a solid copper tube (ldquoshieldrdquo) and a wire inside; several positions, also non-central, were chosen for the wire. The common mode current (between 10 Hz and 100 kHz) through the tube had as return path a single wire, which was placed at several positions, near and at some distance from the shield. A second cable with a braided shield was tested as well. The results show that both the differential mode and the common mode circuit have to be carefully defined for a particular Z/sub t/. Varying either circuit may alter Z/sub t/ drastically. Consequently, the Z/sub t/ of a particular cable measured in a triaxial setup, is a characteristic of that setup and cannot always be used in another setup as in for instance cable bundle...|$|E
40|$|Using a long, {{flexible}} <b>test</b> <b>cable</b> {{connected with}} a one-wire voltage feedback circuit, a resistive tactile sensor in a shared row-column fashion exhibited flexibility in robotic operations but suffered from crosstalk caused by the connected cable due to its wire resistances and its contacted resistances. Firstly, we designed a new non-scanned driving-electrode (VF-NSDE) circuit using two wires for every row line and every column line to reduce the crosstalk caused by the connected cables in the circuit. Then, an equivalent resistance expression of the element being tested (EBT) for the two-wire VF-NSDE circuit was analytically derived. Following this, the one-wire VF-NSDE circuit and the two-wire VF-NSDE circuit were evaluated by simulation experiments. Finally, positive features of the proposed method were verified with the experiments of a two-wire VF-NSDE prototype circuit. The experiment {{results show that the}} two-wire VF-NSDE circuit can greatly reduce the crosstalk error caused by the cables in the 2 -D networked resistive sensor array...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} detect and locate partial {{discharge}} (PD) activity within HV cables and in particular cable joints, the feasibility of using a very high frequency (VHF) capacitive coupler technique has been investigated. In addition, an alternative PD off-line test method for cable joints or cable sections within long cable systems has been developed. By energising the joint or a short section of the cable screen only this method {{has the advantage of}} reducing the power supply requirement of the test source. The application of capacitive couplers for this PD off-line test method has been investigated. In order to use this approach there must be an insulation gap between the coupler and the outer sheath of the <b>test</b> <b>cable.</b> The effect of this gap on measured sensitivity has been investigated experimentally and {{through the use of a}} simulation model. Obtained results are in good agreement. Cross-correlation techniques have been implemented to automatically estimate the signal time of flight from different coupler outputs.

40|$|Cable {{distribution}} {{networks are}} inherently complex and inaccessible systems; {{many of them}} are coming to the end of their original design life. As assets, they represent a dynamic and challenging issue with regard to the tasks of maintenance and management. Partial discharge (PD) has long been recognized as both a cause and symptom of the degradation of dielectric materials that protect high voltage plant. Utilities use the analysis of PD activity to make pre-fault decisions in areas such as maintenance, supply continuity and asset management. On-line PD monitoring systems are still in their relative infancy. An EDF Energy Networks funded research is investigating and identifying trends in PD activity associated with specific faults that commonly occur in distribution networks. In this paper an experiment to mimic the conditions experienced by on-line cable sections in the field is described. PD measurement has been obtained using conventional techniques covered in IEC 60270 in parallel with a commercially available substation monitor that is employed in distribution networks worldwide. Later work will involve using this experiment to PD <b>test</b> <b>cable</b> samples that contain a range of defects.

40|$|High {{density of}} {{electrical}} modules and {{electronic control units}} are, nowadays, extensively integrated into modern automotive systems. Estimate and further control the electromagnetic emissions from these components tend to be increasingly indispensable before marketing them. Full-compliance Absorber Lined Shielded Enclosure (ALSE) method or so-called antenna method according to CISPR 25, gives a standardized test configuration to estimate the radiated emissions on component level. However, this emission test method often suffers from the need of a large anechoic chamber, where often only the integrated impact of common-mode current on the <b>test</b> <b>cable</b> bundle is measured. Availability of a specific-size anechoic chamber and repeated experimental runs after a test failure increase the cost {{for the development of}} a new product. Since the common-mode current can be measured quite easily, it is promising to estimate the level of radiated emissions directly from the measured current. This thesis aims to develop a common-mode current based method to predict the radiated emissions according to CISPR 25 and discuss its applicability based on several complex test cases. Different problems linked to this approach have to be solved. Firstly, appropriate common-mode current acquisition methods are required. Secondly, a flexible common-mode radiation model of the cable bundle is required. Thirdly, in order to get comparable data the real ALSE-test environment has to be taken into account. For the mentioned problems, different solutions are developed and discussed. The proposed solutions are applied to several cable structures and a real stepper-motor drive system.

40|$|The Goddard Space Flight Center's thermal vacuum {{laboratory}} {{has developed}} a high-speed automated system for testing the integrity of 37 -pin MIL-C- 5015 cylindrical electrical feedthrough connectors used on penetration plates of thermal vacuum chambers. The system consists of a desktop PC driving a data acquisition front end. The latter measures the resistance through each pin of the connector and the resistance from each pin to all other pins and the connector shell. In addition to identifying unacceptable feedthroughs, the system is also used for testing cables. In the special case of Type T thermocouples (used almost exclusively at the lab), the difference in resistance between the copper and constantan wires provides positive proof of accidentally reversed connector wiring. Data acquisition time to completely test a cable or feedthrough connector is less than thirty seconds. The system provides a hardcopy printout of the resistance readings. Connectors or cables with fewer wires are tested using simple adapter cables. Initial tests indicate that {{the performance of a}} given feedthrough connector can be predicted on the basis of measured resistance readings, reducing ongoing cost of connector replacement. The opportunity to positively certify the integrity of cables, cable connectors and feedthroughs before the start of a thermal vacuum test minimizes the likelihood of a circuit problem that would require returning the chamber to ambient conditions for repair. This system has two principal advantages for the Goddard thermal vacuum laboratory. Its only significant cost was the labor to fabricate the <b>test</b> <b>cable</b> and shorting cable [...] about 40 man-hours total.

VLF <b>cable</b> <b>testing</b> uses different wave shapes, typically sine and square and {{care must be taken}} when describing the voltage to be used.
