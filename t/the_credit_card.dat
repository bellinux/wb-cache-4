The attendant said that he observed Parsons throwing away clothing, books, posters and carpentry tools into a dumpster. Parsons asked the attendant about the distance to Denver and spoke of Ernest's 9-year-old son as his own. He purchased cigarettes and food with Ernest's MasterCard credit card before leaving. At 7:23 a.m., Parsons used <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> to check into a Quality Inn at Richfield, Utah.

At about 4:25 p.m. on August 31, a Utah Highway Patrol officer found Parsons sleeping in Ernest's car at the Red Creek rest area on Interstate 70, west of Salina, Utah. When Parsons was brought into the Richfield police station where the bloody clothes were gathered, he continued to insist that he was Ernest.

40|$|<b>Credit</b> <b>cards</b> {{have become}} a {{noticeable}} feature on most American households’ financial landscape. Data from the Bank for International Settlements indicate that <b>the</b> number of <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> in circulation increased 34 percent between 1988 and 1994, and <b>the</b> number of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> transactions increased 55 percent. The data also show that <b>the</b> value of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> transactions increased 98 percent during the same period. The higher number of cards and their use increased <b>the</b> size of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt, so that total consumer revolving credit outstanding grew from $ 175 billion to $ 339 billion. Unfortunately, aggregate data like those above fail {{to provide information about}} <b>the</b> composition of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt growth. So it is impossible to tell whether the increased debt arose from a general {{increase in the number of}} households or from a larger proportion of households with <b>credit</b> <b>cards.</b> Aggregate data also do not reveal who holds <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> balances—upper- or lower-income households—nor do they indicate which factor contributed more to <b>the</b> growth of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt—an increase in the number of households with <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> or an increase in average <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> indebtedness. Such detailed information about <b>the</b> components of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt growth is important because each component has different implications for the viability of <b>the</b> growth of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt.

40|$|Abstract Purpose – <b>The</b> Islamic <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> {{is a type}} {{of banking}} product offered by Islamic banks. Given the {{importance}} to <b>the</b> Islamic <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> to Islamic banks, the study is aimed at identifying the factors determining the Malaysian bank customers’ behavioral intention to use <b>the</b> Islamic <b>credit</b> <b>card.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Drawing upon the Theory of Reasoned Action (the TRA model), this study proposes a modified model to examine the acceptance factors of attitude, subjective norm and perceived financial cost within <b>the</b> Islamic <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> context. <b>The</b> study used multiple regression model in order to examine the impacts of these explanatory variables on the intention to use <b>the</b> Islamic <b>credit</b> <b>card.</b> <b>The</b> model is tested using survey data from 257 respondents. Findings – The results reveal that attitude, subjective norm and perceived financial cost significantly influence <b>the</b> Islamic <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> intention to use. Of these, attitude was first ranked factor explaining intention to use <b>the</b> Islamic <b>credit</b> <b>card.</b> Research limitations/implications – The research suffers from two limitations. The first limitation is related to the generalization of finding whilst the second limitation is related to the limited measures employed in the current work. Despite these limitations, this research is significantly contributed to the body of knowledge in the area of Islamic <b>credit</b> <b>card,</b> at least at exploratory level. Practical implications – Information gathered from the study will serve as a basis for more future works in the area of Islamic <b>credit</b> <b>card.</b> <b>The</b> theory developed in the current study’s model could also be generalized into other contexts of Islamic banking products and services. Practically, branch managers of Islamic banking institutions could of prime importance to extend the findings of the study for the better future planning of their Islamic <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> offerings. Originality/value – Importantly, the study extends the applicability of the TRA model into Islamic <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> context.
