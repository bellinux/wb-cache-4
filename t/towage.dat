5|$|Plans for the salvage {{operation}} {{were approved}} by the Irish Coast Guard, and the salvage operation began on 1 September, with work to remove loose ropes and secure the fuel containers; the salvage operation was expected to take up to 3 weeks. Astrid was recovered by the sheerleg GPS Atlas on 9 September 2013 by Atlantic <b>Towage</b> and Marine, and was transported on a barge to Kinsale for assessment and an investigation of what caused the accident. The insurers of the ship deemed the cost of restoring Astrid to be too high due to the damage caused while she was partially submerged (an economic write-off); as such she was scrapped and taken to Cork Harbour to be broken up. The scrapping process was completed by April 2014.|$|E
25|$|Once {{it became}} a {{publicly}} listed company in its own right, Adsteam Marine established a strong investor following. In addition to <b>towage,</b> the company developed shipping agency and tug barging activities. Adsteam Marine doubled its size in May 2001 when it acquired the <b>towage</b> interests of Howard Smith, its partner in many <b>towage</b> ventures, for more than $500 million, making it the largest <b>towage</b> operator in Australia and the United Kingdom, together with operations in Papua New Guinea and Fiji. Other activities included barge operations in the United States, and ships agency services throughout Australia, New Zealand and India.|$|E
25|$|As this {{activity}} was happening, <b>towage</b> began to reassert {{itself as an}} important element of the company; From 1993 it exhibited a period of aggressive growth until the company had a fleet of 156 tug boats, and operated in over 40 Australian, Indian, Pacific Oceana and British ports. Strengthened by a series of industry rationalisations - Brambles' Port Kembla, Sydney and Newcastle operations and P's <b>towage</b> operations in Western Australia - the <b>towage</b> division became a valuable candidate for asset disposal. In April 1997 the company changed its name to Residual Assco Group Limited and in June 1997 floated its marine division which was registered on the Australian Stock Exchange as Adsteam Marine Limited.|$|E
40|$|Two {{phenomena}} {{have been}} studied {{in order to enhance}} the contingency plans and improve the safety of <b>towages.</b> 1. For multi tug <b>towages</b> it is important to prepare proper contingency plans for the case that a tug fails and overrun by the tow is a probability, especially the <b>towages</b> of FPSO’s and huge rigs performed by more tugs. A model has been developed to assess the time between the failure and the moment the tow will collide. After thorough research not the stopping distance proved important, but the time it takes for both objects to collide. In case the tug is allowed to be pulled towards the FPSO, the time from engine failure to collision is 380 [s] or 6 minutes 20 seconds. Both objects will collide with a speed difference of 2. 28 [m/s]. In case the towline is cut, the time until collision is 1479 [s], or 24 minutes and 40 seconds. In this case {{it is very important to}} cut the towline instantly after the engine failure. Otherwise the tug will gain a negative speed of 1 m/s within 2 minutes, and the distance between the FPSO and the tug will be reduced to 683 [m] already. 2. Grounding of tow lines must be avoided the standard of the catenary approach to assume a hyperbolic shape is investigated and a detailed finite element model approach shows that the standard assumptions are not accurate enough. A numerical approach has been used to calculate the effect of current and loss of tension in the wire. The influence of current along the towing-wire depends on the speed, diameter, length and the angle of the towing-wire in the water. The maximum depth increases when the speed increases or the tension in the wire decreases. In the example the depths are on the safe side for depths below 35 [m], but above 35 [m] the values are too optimistic when current is involved. 1...|$|R
25|$|A {{relatively}} minor sideline, {{started in the}} 1890s, was the company's tug boat operations. Gradually, tug boat operations extended {{over a number of}} ports, but until the middle of the 20th century they remained the poor relation of the more significant coastal shipping operations. With the decline of coastal shipping however, <b>towage</b> assumed more importance. By the 1960s, <b>towage</b> and associated operations represented a very significant part of the company's activities.|$|E

25|$|Apart {{from special}} occasions, the city's ice boats were usually only {{employed}} {{for two or}} three months of the yearthrough the winter months of December/January through February/Marchbeing laid up for repair or refit the rest of the year. Though their primary role was to keep Philadelphia's channel to the sea free of ice, towing vessels endangered or hampered by ice was an important secondary task, which had the additional benefit of earning the city <b>towage</b> fees.|$|E
25|$|In 1977 the company's {{interest}} in Bulkships Limited was disposed of, and Adelaide Steamship Company ceased its connection with ship owning and operating. It had diversified into investment and property ownership, vineyard and wine production, optical goods manufacturing and distribution, engineering, share investment, and, until 1973, shipbuilding. Thus <b>towage</b> and associated operations {{continued to have}} prominence, even during the 1970s and 1980s when the Adelaide Steamship Company became the foundation for one the country's major conglomerate organisations.|$|E
25|$|The tug was {{operated}} from 1914 by the Lambton & Hetton Collieries Ltd which, {{merged with}} the Joicey Collieries in 1924 to form the Lambton, Hetton & Joicey Collieries Ltd. In November 1945, a little before the collieries themselves were nationalised and vested in the National Coal Board, the <b>towage</b> business was sold to France, Fenwick Tyne and Wear Ltd which, after refurbishment, operated her at Sunderland on the River Wear until 1964. In 1952, the tug was modified slightly to obtain a passenger certificate, {{so that she could}} transport officials from newly built ships after they had completed their sea trials.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s and 1940s, {{the company}} diversified into the airline operations, <b>towage,</b> shipbuilding, and the {{shipping}} of salt, coal and sugar. Adelaide Airways {{was formed in}} 1935, and purchased West Australian Airways before merging with Holyman's Airways to form Australian National Airways (ANA) in 1936. ANA was sold to Reg Ansett in 1957. In 1964, the Interstate fleet merged with McIlwraith, McEacharn & Co, and the partnership developed the world's first purpose built container ships. However, in 1973, the company ceased its shipbuilding operations, and in 1977, in its 103rd year of operation, the company sold its shipping related businesses, and ceased its connection with ship owning and operating. The company did, however, retain its interests in tugboat operations.|$|E
25|$|By {{the start}} of World War II, the company owned 30 ships. With World War II, the company was again forced to {{surrender}} nine ships to the Navy, including Manoora and Manunda which became an Armed Merchant Cruiser and a hospital ship. Manunda was in Darwin harbour during the Japanese bombing {{and was able to}} bring 260 military and civilian casualties to safety in Fremantle. In all during the war she carried about 30,000 sick and wounded back to Australia from the Middle East and New Guinea. During the 1940s, a decline in trade necessitated the company to diversify and they began to acquire interests in other companies and projects. Consequently, after the war, the company diversified into <b>towage,</b> shipbuilding, and the shipping of salt, coal and sugar.|$|E
25|$|In January 1911, Capt. H.B. James, of Victoria, {{together}} with his lifelong friend and former shipmate Harold Gray Jarvis, a marine surveyor bought Sechelt at Vancouver, formed the Sechelt <b>Towage</b> Company, and then brought the vessel over to Vancouver Island. Although he had had experience as an officer on oceangoing vessels, Captain James had not long operated inland steamships, having arrived in British Columbia in only about late 1909. James and Jarvis then set up business as the British Columbia Steamship Company. In 1910 or early 1911, they chartered the small steel-hulled twin-propeller steamer Tasmanian for a month to run on the route from Victoria to Sooke as test {{to see if the}} business warranted the purchase of a larger vessel. Both James and Jarvis had licenses as master mariners. They then put Sechelt on the Victoria - Sooke route, and she made her first run on March 1, 1911, under Capt. Caral Stromgren.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the next}} decade, and {{particularly}} after 1902, boats on the canal shifted from independent operators to company-owned craft. Boats with colorful names (Bertha M. Young or Lezen Ragan) {{gave way to}} numbered craft ("Canal <b>Towage</b> Company" [...] with a number) run by a schedule.|$|E
2500|$|By the mid-1880s, Clara Clarita {{had passed}} {{into the hands of}} the Knickerbocker Steam <b>Towage</b> Company and been {{converted}} into an oceangoing tug. Her primary duty with this company would most likely have been towing barges filled with ice blocks cut from the Kennebec River to New York City. Along with Ice King, Clara Clarita was one of the company's largest tugs.|$|E
2500|$|Another form {{of cargo}} {{transport}} was the <b>towage</b> of log rafts. [...] As of February 1896, Sarah Dixon was employed in towing saw logs. [...] According {{to the editor}} of the Oregon Mist, a St. Helens newspaper, who was aways a booster for the boat, “ is too bad to wear out such a good boat in that business, but the Dixon is a good towboat just the same.” ...|$|E
2500|$|With the {{completion}} of the liquidation, on 30 April 1997 the company was renamed Residual Assco Group Limited in order that the Adelaide Steamship name could be reused. Residual Assco was delisted on 24 December 1999.A subsequent entry dated 3 April 2007 states: [...] "company is an unlisted public company awaiting resolution of outstanding tax issues - it may then be wound up - shareholders are unlikely to receive any return but they can contact the company on 02 9258 8833 or Registries Ltd on 02 9290 9600". In June 1997, the tug boat operations were floated on the Australian Stock Exchange under the name Adsteam Marine. In 2001, Adsteam Marine acquired its joint venture partner (and major rival as the premier Australian <b>towage</b> operator), Howard Smith. Adsteam Marine became the largest <b>towage</b> operator in Australia and the United Kingdom, with further extensive operations in the South Pacific. In 2006, Adsteam Marine was acquired as the Pacific arm of the world's largest shipping company, AP Moeller-Maersk, thus removing the Adelaide Steamship name from the Australian Stock Exchange and Australian Company registers.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the course}} of his career, Southard served his region in many {{different}} capacities. He was Richmond's first postmaster, and later became an [...] "active director" [...] on the boards of several New England railroad and telegraph companies, <b>towage</b> corporations, banks and other institutions, such as the Portland and Kennebec Railroad, International Telegraph Company, and the State Bank and First National Bank, as well as being a longstanding president of the Sagadahoc Agricultural and Horticultural Society. He also served his state as a politician, firstly {{as a member of the}} Maine House of Representatives, in 1853, and later as a state senator in 1865-66. Southard was a Douglas Democrat before the American Civil War, but later became a supporter of President Abraham Lincoln.|$|E
2500|$|In 1856 John Moody and Charles Seale Hayne {{established}} a Dartmouth–Totnes steamboat service. The first vessel in the fleet was the purpose-built PS Louisa, a 90-foot paddle steamer built at Deptford on the River Thames in 1856. [...] Two years later, two additional paddle steamers were acquired second hand - the PS Mary for the Totnes run, and PS Pilot for <b>towage</b> work in Dartmouth harbour. [...] In 1859 {{the company was}} incorporated under the name the Dartmouth Steam Packet Company. The new company bought all of the shares of the Louisa {{and a majority of}} the shares in the Pilot in 1859; with the Mary returning to South Shields. [...] For the next few years, the Pilot, having been refitted as a full-time passenger boat, ran coastal and cross-channel trips, in addition to the normal services.|$|E
2500|$|The {{jurisdiction}} of the British court of admiralty was extended in both 1840 and in 1861 by the Admiralty Court Acts of 1840 and 1861. [...] That increase in jurisdiction did not flow down to the New South Wales court. [...] The British Parliament passed the Vice Admiralty Courts Act 1863 (UK) to confirm the colonial {{jurisdiction of}} the courts as well as giving them jurisdiction over ships mortgages, disputes over ownership or possession of ships, employment, the earnings of any registered ship, claims for master’s wages, <b>towage</b> and building or repairing ships. The Act provided for {{an appeal to the}} Privy Council and also allowed the judge of the court to appoint a registrar or marshal locally, rather than wait on an appointment from the United Kingdom. [...] However, these changes did not make the court a local court, and the court was still an Imperial Court of the United Kingdom.|$|E
6000|$|And when we rose not a {{word had}} been said about <b>towage!</b> Not a word! The game was won and the honour was safe. Oh! blessed white cotton umbrella!

6000|$|We {{ignored his}} noise. But Hermann's {{excitement}} suddenly {{went off the}} boil as when you remove a saucepan from the fire. I urged on his consideration {{that he had done}} now with Falk and Falk's confounded tug. He, Hermann, would not, perhaps, turn up again {{in this part of the}} world for years to come, since he was going to sell the Diana at the end of this very trip ("Go home passenger in a mail boat," [...] he murmured mechanically). He was therefore safe from Falk's malice. All he had to do was to race off to his consignees and stop payment of the <b>towage</b> bill before Falk had the time to get in and lift the money.|$|E
6000|$|Naturally, I did {{not believe}} Schomberg, but I own that for a time I {{observed}} closely what went on. All I discovered was some impatience on Hermann's part. At the sight of Falk, stepping over the gangway, the excellent man would begin to mumble and chew between his teeth something that sounded like German swear-words. However, as I've said, I'm {{not familiar with the}} language, and Hermann's soft, round-eyed countenance remained unchanged. Staring stolidly ahead he greeted him with, [...] "Wie gehts," [...] or in English, [...] "How are you?" [...] with a throaty enunciation. The girl would look up for an instant and move her lips slightly: Mrs. Hermann let her hands rest on her lap to talk volubly to him {{for a minute or so}} in her pleasant voice before she went on with her sewing again. Falk would throw himself into a chair, stretch his big legs, as like as not draw his hands down his face passionately. As to myself, he was not pointedly impertinent: it was rather as though he could not be bothered with such trifles as my existence; and the truth is that being a monopolist he was under no necessity to be amiable. He was sure to get his own extortionate terms out of me for <b>towage</b> whether he frowned or smiled. As a matter of fact, he did neither: but before many days elapsed he managed to astonish me not a little and to set Schomberg's tongue clacking more than ever.|$|E
6000|$|For that, too, Falk {{was made}} {{responsible}} apparently. And {{looking at my}} Hermann's heavy, puffy, good-natured face, I knew he would not exert himself till greatly exasperated, and, therefore, would thrash very hard, and being fat would resent the necessity. How Falk had managed to turn the girl's head was more difficult to understand. I supposed Hermann would know. And then hadn't there been Miss Vanlo? It could not be his silvery tongue, or the subtle seduction of his manner; he had no more {{of what is called}} [...] "manner" [...] than an animal--which, however, on the other hand, is never, and can never be called vulgar. Therefore it must have been his bodily appearance, exhibiting a virility of nature as exaggerated as his beard, and resembling a sort of constant ruthlessness. It was seen in the very manner he lolled in the chair. He meant no offence, but his intercourse was characterised by that sort of frank disregard of susceptibilities a man of seven foot six, living in a world of dwarfs, would naturally assume, without in the least wishing to be unkind. But amongst men of his own stature, or nearly, this frank use of his advantages, in such matters as the awful <b>towage</b> bills for instance, caused much impotent gnashing of teeth. When attentively considered it seemed appalling at times. He was a strange beast. But maybe women liked it. Seen in that light he was well worth taming, and I suppose every woman at the bottom of her heart considers herself as a tamer of strange beasts. But Hermann arose with precipitation to carry the news to his wife. I had barely the time, as he made for the cabin door, to grab him by the seat of his inexpressibles. I begged him to wait till Falk in person had spoken with him. There remained some small matter to talk over, as I understood.|$|E
