The decision to rectify <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the castle may have been taken by King Henry himself. Oxenbridge appears to have stayed on as the pay master and acted as {{the master of the}} works, with von Haschenperg remaining in his role as engineer almost {{until the end of the}} project, despite the difficulties with his earlier work. The cost of the second phase of work was much higher than the first, around £10,000.|$|E

5|$|According to the anti-nuclear movement, most of <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> {{nuclear power}} today are {{much the same}} as in the 1970s.

Nuclear weapons proliferation continues to occur, notably in Pakistan and North Korea, building on facilities and expertise from civilian nuclear operations. The alternatives to nuclear power, efficient energy use and renewable energy (especially wind power), have been further developed and commercialised.|$|E

5|$|By 1867, church {{authorities}} deemed <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> {{the tower}} as {{severe enough to}} warrant a major reconstruction of the church. George Gilbert Scott, who had recently designed the monumental London buildings of the Foreign Office and St.Pancras Station, was chosen to lead the project. Scott was a leading advocate of the Gothic Revival and saw the renovation {{as a chance to}} return St.Mary's to a state nearer to its earlier Gothic design.|$|E
5|$|Describing {{the system}} in November 1988, Cray stated that the 12 times {{performance}} increase would {{be made up of}} a three times increase due to GaAs circuits, and four times due to the use of more processors. One of <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the Cray-2 had been poor multiprocessing performance due to limited bandwidth between the processors, and to address this the Cray-3 would adopt the much faster architecture used in the Cray Y-MP. This would provide a design performance of 8000 MIPS, or 16 GFLOPS.|$|E

In the third book, Narayan addresses the concept of a wife putting up with her husband's antics and attitudes.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s {{samples of}} extremophile molds {{were taken from}} Mir. Ninety species of {{micro-organisms}} were found in 1990, {{four years after the}} station's launch. By the time of its decommission in 2001, the number of known different micro-organisms had grown to 140. As space stations get older, <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> contamination get worse. Moulds that develop aboard space stations can produce acids that degrade metal, glass and rubber. The moulds in Mir were found growing behind panels and inside air-conditioning equipment. The moulds also caused bad smell, which was often cited as visitors' strongest impressions.|$|E

Richbourg was killed when the Sea Dart he was piloting disintegrated in midair. The four surviving planes were retired in 1957, but some were kept in reserve until 1962.|$|E

5|$|A {{week later}} Kujau met Jäckel and Alex Kuhn in {{connection}} with the poems he had forged and sold to Stiefel. These had been published by Jäckel and Kuhn in 1980, but one historian pointed out that one of the poems could not have been produced by Hitler as it had been written by the poet Herybert Menzel. Jäckel was concerned that the poem in question had been accompanied by a letter on Nazi party stationery guaranteeing it as a genuine work by Hitler. Many of the other pieces in Stiefel's collection were similarly verified, so doubts began to surface over these, too. Kujau claimed ignorance, saying he was only the middleman, but told them that Heidemann, a reputed journalist, had seen the crash site from which the papers originated; Jäckel advised Stiefel to have his collection forensically examined, and passed 26 suspect poems to the Hamburg district attorney for investigation. Gruner + Jahr also knew about <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the poems, and that the source had been Kujau, but he assured them that this source had been elsewhere in East Germany, unconnected to the diaries, and they continued with their deal.|$|E
5|$|After an enquiry into <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the {{airborne}} missions in Sicily, the British Army and Royal Air Force submitted some recommendations. Aircrew {{had to be}} trained in parachute and glider operations, and pathfinders landing before the main force had to {{have enough time to}} set out their beacons. The landing plan was simplified, with complete brigades landing on one drop zone, instead of the smaller battalion landing areas used in Sicily. Gliders were no longer released at night while still over water, and their landing zones would be large enough to accommodate the aircraft with room to spare. Following the friendly fire incident over the convoy, more training was given to ships' crews in aircraft recognition, and Allied aircraft were painted with three large white stripes on their wings. Training for pilots belonging to the Glider Pilot Regiment was increased, and improvements to the gliders were implemented, including better inter-aircraft communication.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the fishing}} {{industry}} thrived in Christchurch, {{the importance of the}} harbour declined as it became inaccessible to vessels of a large draught. The harbour entrance was particularly troublesome with constantly shifting sandbars. In 1665 Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon, bought the Lordship of the Manor of Christchurch. As part of his plans to improve trade in the town, he attempted to resolve <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the harbour entrance by cutting a new one through the sandspit at the foot of Hengistbury Head. However, upon completion the new entrance repeatedly silted up and in 1703 a large storm damaged a groyne which blocked the entrance entirely. Over the following 150 years alternative schemes were proposed but none were ever taken up.|$|E
