Using scanning electron microscopy, Benner Larson has identified 15 different punches used on the plates, falling into three distinct <b>tool</b> <b>sets.</b> No individual plate has marks from more than one of these groups, and this fits with previous attempts at stylistic attribution, which identify at least three different silversmiths. Multiple artisans would also explain the highly variable purity and thickness of the silver.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{realization}} of the handwheel function is a key problem for development of numerical control system of micro milling machine. This paper introduced the interface specifications and hardware connecting methods of handwheel NK 100 AB 2, developed control program based on PMAC (Programmable Multi-Axis Controller) and industrial personal computer, finally achieved the function of axes selecting and the feed rate selecting. Based on the traditional edge detector <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> method, an improved <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> method is proposed. The inverted micro milling cutter hilt is used to replace the traditional edge detector, which avoids the opposite reamer error caused by the irregular cutter blade shape, finally, <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> function is achieved through the collecting of electrical signal. The research will provide a useful reference for the {{realization of}} handwheel and <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> of micro milling machine based on PMAC...|$|R
