25|$|Various {{aspects of}} {{pterosaur}} biology invited controversy from the beginning. Samuel Thomas von Soemmering ignited a multi-century {{debate over how}} pterosaurs walked on the ground by suggesting they crawled on all fours like bats. August Quenstedt, by contrast, argued that they walked on their hind limbs. In the early 20th century, Hankin and Watson in the first major study of pterosaur flight biomechanics concluded that on the ground these reptiles were altogether helpless and could only scoot along on their stomachs like penguins. The debate gained steam in 1957 when William Stokes reported unusual tracks left by a four-footed animal he suspected was a pterosaur walking along the ground. In 1984, Kevin Padian, who had recently argued that pterosaurs walked on their hind legs, dismissed Stokes's tracks as those of a crocodilian. However, in the mid-1990s, Jean-Michel Mazin and others reported that fossil footprints in Crayssac, France were similar to <b>those</b> <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> Stokes from the US. Mazin's tracks were more obviously pterosaurian in origin and settled the debate in favor of pterosaurs walking on all fours.|$|E
500|$|Some of the {{attributes}} of mermaids may {{have been influenced by}} the Sirens of Greek mythology. [...] Historical accounts of mermaids, such as <b>those</b> <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> Christopher Columbus during his exploration of the Caribbean, may have been inspired by manatees and similar aquatic mammals. [...] While {{there is no evidence that}} mermaids exist outside folklore, reports of mermaid sightings continue to the present day, including 21st century examples from Israel and Zimbabwe.|$|E

500|$|In 1920 and 1922, Regina {{physician}} F.A. Corbett {{was commissioned}} {{to visit the}} schools in {{the west of the}} country, and found similar results to <b>those</b> <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> Bryce. At the Ermineskin school in Hobbema, Alberta, he found 50% of the children had tuberculosis. At Sarcee Boarding School near Calgary, he noted that all 33 students were [...] "much below even a passable standard of health" [...] and [...] "ll but four were infected with tuberculosis". In one classroom, he found 16 ill children, many near death, who were being made to sit through lessons.|$|E

[...] Kennedy also testified that he attended a meeting during which Dr. Cotter orally reported that his testing reached results similar to <b>those</b> <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> Uhlmann.

2500|$|Athena's epithet Pallas {{is derived}} either from , meaning [...] "to brandish [...] ", or, more likely, from [...] and related words, meaning [...] "youth, young woman". On this topic, Walter Burkert says [...] "she is the Pallas of Athens, Pallas Athenaie, just as Hera of Argos is Here Argeie." [...] In later times, after the {{original}} meaning of the name had been forgotten, the Greeks invented myths to explain its origin, such as <b>those</b> <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> the Epicurean philosopher Philodemus and the ancient mythographer Pseudo-Apollodorus, which claim that Pallas was originally a separate entity, whom Athena had slain in combat.|$|E
2500|$|Another partial {{replication}} {{of the experiment}} was conducted by Jerry M. Burger in 2006 and broadcast on the Primetime series Basic Instincts. Burger noted that [...] "current standards {{for the ethical treatment}} of participants clearly place Milgram's studies out of bounds." [...] In 2009, Burger was able to receive approval from the institutional review board by modifying several of the experimental protocols. Burger found obedience rates virtually identical to <b>those</b> <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> Milgram found in 1961–62, even while meeting current ethical regulations of informing participants. In addition, half the replication participants were female, and their rate of obedience was virtually identical to that of the male participants. Burger also included a condition in which participants first saw another participant refuse to continue. However, participants in this condition obeyed at the same rate as participants in the base condition.|$|E

2500|$|Rivers's {{first task}} was to examine first hand the colour vision of the islanders and compare it to that of Europeans. In {{the course of his}} {{examinations}} of the visual acuity of the natives, Rivers showed that colour-blindness did not exist or was very rare, but that the colour vision of Papuans was not the same type as that of Europeans; they possessed no word for blue, and an intelligent native found nothing unnatural in applying the same name to the brilliant blue sea or sky and to the deepest black. [...] "Moreover," [...] Head goes on to state in Rivers's obituary notice, [...] "he was able to explode to old fallacy that the 'noble savage' was endowed with powers of vision far exceeding that of civilised natives. Errors of refraction are, it is true, less common, especially myopia. But, altogether the feats of the Torres Straits islanders equalled <b>those</b> <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> travellers {{from other parts of the}} world, they were due to the power of attending to minute details in familiar and strictly limited surrounding, and not to supernormal visual acuity." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Myers {{concludes that}} 'it {{does not seem}} worth while, as a rule, to examine the {{testimony}} to physical marvels occurring {{in the presence of}} professional mediums'. He therefore collects evidence in the article quoted, for physical marvels occurring where there is no paid medium. Here, as in the business of levitation, the interest of the anthropologist and mythologist lies in the uniformity and identity of narratives from all countries, climates, and ages. Among the earliest rappings with which we chance to be familiar are <b>those</b> <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> Froissart {{in the case of the}} spirit Orthon, in the fourteenth century. The tale had become almost a fabliau, but any one who reads the amusing chapter will see that it is based on a belief in disturbances like those familiar to Glanvill and the Misses Fox. Cieza de Leon (1549) in the passage already quoted, where he describes the levitated Cacique of Pirza in Popyan, adds that 'the Christians saw stones falling from the air' (as in the Greatrakes tale of the Youghal witch), and declares that, 'when the chief was sitting with a glass of liquor before him, the Christians saw the glass raised up in the air and put down empty, and a short time afterwards the wine was again poured into the cup from the air'. Mr. Home once equalled this marvel, {109a} and Ibn Batuta reports similar occurrences, earlier, at the court of the King of Delhi. There is another case in Histoire Prodigieuse d'une jeune Fille agitee d'un Esprit fantastique et invisible. {109b} A bourgeois of Bonneval was beset by a rapping rattle of a sprite. 'At dinner, when he would lay his hand on a trencher, it was carried off elsewhere, and the wineglass, when he was about drinking, was snatched from his hand.' So Mr. Wesley's trencher was set spinning on the table, when nobody touched it! In such affairs we may have the origin of the story of the Harpies at the court of Phineus.|$|E
