5|$|The sepoys {{were also}} accused {{of not being}} able to adjust and adapt to the living {{conditions}} in their new environment. While in India, the sepoys would have a constant supply of goat meat and milk but because it was difficult to receive a constant supply of goat in Singapore, the sepoys had to make do with a substitute – chicken - and very little milk. The sepoys resorted to buying their own meat and milk <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> insufficient amount they received and the use of the dollar versus the rupee irked them further.|$|E
5|$|After this, the Australian Corps {{was removed}} from the line for rest and {{training}} in preparation for further operations. In order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> losses the Australians had suffered during the previous months, a number of Australian battalions were disbanded at this time to provide reinforcements to those that remained. The 32nd Battalion received a large number of reinforcements from the all-Victorian 29th Battalion, which was subsequently disbanded. It was still out of the line when the Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918. During the battalion's final series of battles, the battalion was led by Major Blair Wark, who was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his leadership and bravery.|$|E

5|$|Chicago's defense {{allowed the}} 5th least total yardage, allowed less than 100yards per {{game on the}} ground, and allowed the fewest yards per drive of any NFL team. The line was {{anchored}} by Adewale Ogunleye, who had 6.5 sacks, and Pro Bowler Tommie Harris, who recorded 5, along with rookie Mark Anderson, who led the team with 12 sacks. Behind them, {{two of the three}} Bears starting linebackers, Lance Briggs, and Brian Urlacher, were selected to the 2007 Pro Bowl. In the secondary, cornerbacks Ricky Manning and Charles Tillman each recorded five interceptions. The defense was also able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> offense's poor performance earlier in the season, as explained in the win against the Cardinals in Week 6.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{withdrawal}} of U.S. forces under the policy of Vietnamization, from 1 November 1968 until 23 February 1973, Barrel Roll competed for a share of diminishing U.S tactical air assets. In December 1968, approximately 700 American strike aircraft had been available in-theater. By the spring of 1972, that number had fallen to 313. On 18 July, the Nakhon Phanom-based 22nd Special Operations Squadron was disbanded. Its sister squadron, the 602nd Special Operations Squadron, closed out on 20 December, leaving only the 1st Special Operations Squadron at Nakhon Phanom to support Royal Laotian ground operations. The RLAF attempted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> diminishing number of American sorties. During 1968 the Laotians flew 10,000 strike sorties. During 1970 through 1972 that number increased to over 30,000 in each year.|$|E
5|$|During {{the week}} of 22 May, United had a bye week from league play, which allowed the club to {{schedule}} a home friendly against the defending Dutch champions, AFC Ajax of Amsterdam. The previous week, Ajax had tallied a 3–1 win over Twente to secure the Dutch title for an unprecedented 30th time, their first since 2004. The Amsterdamers notched an early strike in the 10th minute thanks to forward, and Serbian international, Miralem Sulejmani. The Black-and-Red managed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> early setback thanks to a 58th-minute cross from Ngwenya to newly drafted Blake Brettschneider, leveling the match at one apiece. However, the match ended in Ajax's favor over United as the Amsterdammers tallied a final goal in the 87th minute courtesy of midfielder Vurnon Anita.|$|E

5|$|Frank Womack's {{captaincy}} and {{the creativity}} of Scottish international playmaker Johnny Crosbie contributed much to Birmingham winning their second Division Two title in 1920–21. Womack went on to make 515 appearances, a club record for an outfielder, over a twenty-year career. 1920 also saw the debut of the 19-year-old Joe Bradford, {{who went on to}} score a club record 267 goals in 445 games, and won 12 caps for England. In 1931, manager Leslie Knighton led the club to their first FA Cup Final, which they lost 2–1 to Second Division club West Bromwich Albion. Though Birmingham remained in the top flight for 18 seasons, they struggled in the league, with much reliance placed on England goalkeeper Harry Hibbs <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> lack of goals, Bradford excepted, at the other end. They were finally relegated in 1939, the last full season before the Football League was abandoned {{for the duration of the}} Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Imo {{was granted}} {{clearance}} to leave Bedford Basin by {{signals from the}} guard ship HMCS Acadia at approximately 7:30 {{on the morning of}} 6 December, with Pilot William Hayes on board. The ship entered the Narrows well above the harbour's speed limit in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> delay experienced in loading her cargo. Imo met American tramp steamer SS Clara being piloted up the wrong (western) side of the harbour. The pilots agreed to pass starboard-to-starboard. Soon afterwards though, Imo was forced to head even further towards the Dartmouth shore after passing the tugboat Stella Maris, which was travelling up the harbour to Bedford Basin near mid-channel. Horatio Brannen, the captain of Stella Maris, saw Imo approaching at excessive speed and ordered his ship closer to the western shore to avoid an accident.|$|E
5|$|Louis {{returned}} to Britain in May 1869. In June he joined HMS Royal Alfred, the flagship of the North America and West Indies Station, becoming a midshipman in October. From June to September 1870 he took leave in Germany, {{coinciding with the}} Franco-Prussian war, but {{he spent the next}} three-and-a-half years in the Americas (Bermuda and Halifax, Nova Scotia), where his tour of duty served <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> training he had missed while posted with the Prince of Wales on the Ariadne. Returning to Europe in early 1874, he was posted to the shore establishment HMS Excellent, and passed the sub-lieutenant's examinations—gaining the best marks ever recorded at seamanship and joint best-ever at gunnery.|$|E

5|$|McCall {{came through}} City's youth system {{after he was}} signed by George Mulhall in 1980 from Farsley Celtic {{at the age of}} 16, before {{becoming}} an apprentice in June 1981. Mulhall's successor, Roy McFarland gave McCall his first-team debut at Reading on 28 August 1982 – the opening day of the 1982–83 season – when he deputised for Ces Podd at right back. He had played just six league games by 29 January 1983 when he made the first of 134 consecutive league appearances, all in midfield under new manager Trevor Cherry. City finished 12th in Division Three that season. The following season City struggled <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> absence of Bobby Campbell, who had left to join Derby County, and won just one of their first fifteen games, until Cherry bought Campbell back from Derby, and City won a record ten consecutive games {{on their way to a}} seventh place finish.|$|E

5|$|The voter {{approval}} of Initiative 695 in 1999, which eliminated the motor vehicle excise tax used to fund ferry service, cut $93 {{million from the}} ferry system's budget {{by the end of}} 2001. Voter rejection of 2002's Referendum 51, which would have funded the replacement of car ferries with a gas tax, led the state to consider eliminating passenger-only service to Bremerton and Vashon Island <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> shortfall. In May 2003, the state legislature approved cuts to ferry service, including the elimination of passenger-only ferries. Passenger-only ferry service ceased operations on September 20, 2003, and the MV Chinook and MV Snohomish were sold in 2008 to Golden Gate Ferries in the San Francisco Bay Area after an unsuccessful auction on eBay.|$|E
5|$|These later castles did {{not always}} have a keep, but {{this may have been}} because the more complex design of the castle as a whole drove up costs and the keep was sacrificed to save money. The larger towers {{provided}} space for habitation <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> loss of the donjon. Where keeps did exist, they were no longer square but polygonal or cylindrical. Gateways were more strongly defended, with the entrance to the castle usually between two half-round towers which were connected by a passage above the gateway– although there was great variety in the styles of gateway and entrances– and one or more portcullis.|$|E
