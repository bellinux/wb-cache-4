Power-ups scattered across each world, presented as picture frames, include carrots that extend Robbit's health, extra lives, time-outs <b>that</b> <b>stop</b> the clock and freeze the level's dynamics for a few seconds, hourglasses that extend the player's time, and power pills that make Robbit invincible {{for a short period}} of time. Enemies in the game vary from anthropomorphic versions of creatures to robots and plants.|$|E
5|$|SODO Station {{was first}} {{proposed}} in the late 1980s, but was ignored in subsequent light rail proposals until {{the addition of the}} Beacon Hill Tunnel to the Central Link route in 1998. It was built between 2005 and 2006 by Kiewit Pacific and opened to Link service on July 18, 2009. Trains serve the station 20 hours a day on most days; the headway between trains is 6 minutes during peak periods, with less frequent service at other times. SODO Station is also served by several Sound Transit Express and King County Metro buses <b>that</b> <b>stop</b> on the SODO Busway adjacent to the platforms.|$|E

5|$|Beacon Hill Station {{was first}} {{proposed}} in 1998 and was opened on July 18, 2009, {{as part of}} the inaugural Link line, after five years of tunnel boring and station construction. It consists of a single island platform, divided into two sections by the twin bores of the Beacon Hill Tunnel; four high-speed elevators ferry passengers from the platform to the surface entrance. Trains serve the station 20 hours a day on most days; the headway between trains is 6 minutes during peak periods, with less frequent service at other times. Beacon Hill Station is also served by two King County Metro buses <b>that</b> <b>stop</b> at a pair of sheltered bus stops on Beacon Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Cells <b>that</b> <b>stop</b> {{dividing}} (post-mitotic) and differentiate into neurons {{early in}} cortical development {{are important in}} laying the groundwork on which other developing neurons can be guided to their proper destination. Tbr1 aids in neuronal migration in the early development of the cerebral cortex. It is largely expressed in post-mitotic neurons of the preplate, which forms a foundation upon which neurons are able to grow and move. As a transcription factor, Tbr1 modulates the expression of RELN, which encodes the Reln protein that forms part of the extracellular matrix of cells. Thus, through regulation of Reln expression, Tbr1 regulates {{the formation of the}} matrix through which neurons migrate. Without Tbr1, neurons fail to migrate properly.|$|E
5|$|Freight trains {{started using}} the tunnel on 26 August 2011, and {{passenger}} trains on 28 August. The official opening {{took place on}} 2 September. Along with several other projects west of Oslo, including a new Lysaker Station and Høvik Station, and an upgrade to the Drammen Line between Lysaker and Etterstad, {{the completion of the}} Asker Line will allow higher service frequency, higher regularity and faster trains west of Oslo. A new high-frequency schedule, named Route Plan 2012, was planned for introduction in early 2013 following delivery of new Stadler FLIRT trains. This will also allow for more trains <b>that</b> <b>stop</b> at all stations on the Drammen Line and introduce three hourly trains to Vestfold and six hourly trains stopping at the main stations west of Oslo.|$|E

5|$|Mount Baker {{is served}} by six King County Metro bus routes <b>that</b> <b>stop</b> at the Mount Baker Transit Center, a three-bay bus station located on Forest Street between Rainier Avenue and Martin Luther King Jr. Way that opened on September 19, 2009. Routes 7 and 9 Express run through the transit center, {{connecting}} the Rainier Valley to Downtown Seattle and Capitol Hill; Route 8 terminates at Mount Baker, running north to the Central District, Capitol Hill, and the Seattle Center in Uptown; Route 14 runs through the transit center, connecting Downtown and the Mount Baker area of the city (that the station was named after); Route 48 terminates at Mount Baker, running north to the University District via the Central District; Route 106, which begins in the International District, switches to local, frequent-stop service at Mount Baker, running on Martin Luther King Jr. Way South to Rainier Beach and towards Skyway and Renton.|$|E
5|$|Stadium Station was {{proposed}} in 1998 {{as part of}} the segment between the Downtown Seattle and Beacon Hill tunnels and subsequently deferred months later. It was reinstated in 2005 and construction of the station was completed in May 2006, several years before Link light rail service began on July 18, 2009. Trains serve the station 20 hours a day on most days; the headway between trains is 6 minutes during peak periods, with less frequent service at other times. Stadium Station is also served by several Sound Transit Express and King County Metro buses <b>that</b> <b>stop</b> on the SODO Busway west of the platform, as well as the Seattle Greyhound station east of the platform.|$|E
