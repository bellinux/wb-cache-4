5|$|About half-past {{one o'clock}} on the morning, an {{explosion}} {{took place in}} Felling colliery, by which nine men and thirteen boys were hurried into eternity, several others severely burnt, and all the underground horses but one destroyed. The accident occurred {{at the time of}} calling course, or when one set of men were relieving another. Several of the morning shift men were standing round the mouth of the pit, waiting <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down,</b> when the blast occurred, and the part who had just descended met it soon after they had reached the bottom of the shaft; these were most miserably burnt and mangled.|$|E
5|$|American Philo McGiffin, who was {{on board}} Zhenyuan, {{reported}} after the battle {{that there had been}} a variety of stories about the fate of the ship, but one that the survivors agreed on was the tale of the interaction between Captain Deng and his dog. As the ship went down, the captain ended up clinging to a piece of debris. However, his dog swam to him. Deng released the debris, and unable to swim, he drowned along with the dog. Chinese sources have subsequently stated Captain Deng made the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> with Zhiyuan. In this retelling, the dog attempted to drag him to safety, but he refused to be moved and both died.|$|E

As the stricken Cloudbase loses altitude, Green is killed by another explosion, which also cripples Blue and leaves him unable to save himself.

5|$|There were {{numerous}} proposals {{at the time}} to build an electric aerial tramway, with one such line <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> the Avenida de Mayo. One proposal was the 1889 Le Tellier proposal, which envisioned multiple lines running along the city's wider avenues with the trams moved using cables and would hang from steel rails fixed to 6 metre high steel and iron posts positioned in 10–15 metre intervals. The lines would take 24 months to build and construction would commence 3 months after their approval by the Argentine National Congress, a decision which was ultimately not taken, favouring instead an underground tramway.|$|E

5|$|After the High Councillor's {{downfall}} and the regime's {{defeat in}} Metropolis, the Regime is dismantled {{and all of}} its accomplices are arrested. Harley Quinn has the Joker sent back to the prime universe after realizing that he does not care about her, Green Lantern hands over his counterpart and Sinestro to the Guardians of the Universe to stand trial, and Wonder Woman dethrones her counterpart. The dictator Superman is placed in a prison emitting red sun radiation that renders him powerless, and his prime counterpart admits that if he were placed in the same position, he might have done the same thing. The alternate Batman tells Superman that he hopes that Superman never has to learn what he could be capable of if he turns evil, and warns him that if something ever happens to him, causing him <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> the path of his counterpart, he will come after him. As they walk away, the alternate Superman's eyes glow red, indicating he still has some degree of his powers.|$|E
5|$|Eames impersonates Fischer's godfather, Peter Browning, {{to suggest}} Fischer reconsider his father's will. Yusuf drives the van {{as the other}} dreamers are sedated into the second level. In the second level, a hotel dreamed by Arthur, Cobb persuades Fischer {{that he has been}} kidnapped by Browning and Cobb is his {{subconscious}} protector. Cobb persuades him <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> another level to explore Browning's subconscious (in reality, it is a ruse to enter Fischer's). The third level is a fortified hospital on a snowy mountain dreamed by Eames. The team has to infiltrate it and hold off the guards as Cobb takes Fischer into the equivalent of his subconscious. Yusuf, under pursuit by Fischer's projections in the first level, deliberately drives off a bridge and initiates his kick too soon. This causes an avalanche in Eames' level and removes the gravity of Arthur's level, forcing him to improvise a new kick synchronized with the van hitting the water. Mal's projection emerges and kills Fischer; Cobb kills Mal, and Saito succumbs to his wounds. Cobb and Ariadne enter Limbo to rescue Fischer and Saito, while Eames sets up a kick by rigging the hospital with explosives.|$|E

Meanwhile, above ground, Emma finds the opening of the elevator shaft and volunteers <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> the shaft, where she succeeds in rescuing Henry and Archie. Archie tells Regina that he will continue to see Henry and that if she attempts to interfere he will take action against Regina and have her declared an unfit mother. Regina backs down after Archie's threat, she looks at the object she had in her pocket and throws it down the shaft, where it lands on top of the rest of Snow White's (Ginnifer Goodwin) glass coffin.|$|E

5|$|The Leafs {{finished}} {{in first place}} {{at the end of}} the regular season. Kennedy had finished the regular season third in points on the team behind the other two star centers Apps and Bentley, but it was Kennedy who was to dominate the playoffs. In the first round Toronto played Boston and eliminated the Bruins in five games. Kennedy set up the tying goal which led to an overtime win in game 1 and scored four times in the second game. But it was in the fifth and deciding for which he received greatest praise for his fore-checking tenacity and clutch goalscoring. First, with Toronto down 2–1 and the Bruins having the better of the play, he out-fought two Boston players for possession to get the puck to Bentley who in turn set up Lynn for the tying goal. Then later, Kennedy was carrying the puck into the Boston end. He passed to Meeker, who returned the pass, Kennedy faked once, moved in front of the net, forced goaltender Brimseck <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down,</b> then lifted the puck over him. In the finals, Toronto swept Montreal in four straight games to win the Stanley Cup. Kennedy scored twice in the Cup-winning game and finished leading all players in the playoffs in points with eight goals and five assists and he was also not given a single penalty in the entire playoffs. His checking and work in the corners has been credited as critical to the victory.|$|E
