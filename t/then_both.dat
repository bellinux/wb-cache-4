He scored his first Premier League goal at Crystal Palace on Boxing Day 2004. He scored again on Boxing Day in 2006, when grabbing two headed goals against West Ham United.|$|E
5|$|Phenomenalism is {{the theory}} that {{representations}} (or sense data) of external objects are all that exist. Such a view was briefly adopted by Bertrand Russell {{and many of the}} logical positivists during the early 20th century. A third possibility is to accept the existence of a basic substance that is neither physical nor mental. The mental and physical would <b>then</b> <b>both</b> be properties of this neutral substance. Such a position was adopted by Baruch Spinoza and was popularized by Ernst Mach in the 19th century. This neutral monism, as it is called, resembles property dualism.|$|E

5|$|Selection has {{different}} effects on traits. Stabilizing selection acts {{to hold a}} trait at a stable optimum, and in the simplest case all deviations from this optimum are selectively disadvantageous. Directional selection favours extreme values of a trait. The uncommon disruptive selection also acts during transition periods when the current mode is sub-optimal, but alters the trait {{in more than one}} direction. In particular, if the trait is quantitative and univariate <b>then</b> <b>both</b> higher and lower trait levels are favoured. Disruptive selection can be a precursor to speciation.|$|E
5|$|The egg size is {{independent}} of the clutch size and the nest site, but may vary between different females. The female incubates for 17–18days before the altricial downy chicks are hatched, and is fed at the nest by the male. The female broods the newly hatched chicks for around ten days, and <b>then</b> <b>both</b> parents share feeding and nest sanitation duties. The chicks fledge 31–41days after hatching.|$|E
5|$|The {{two ships}} of the Formidabile class were ordered by Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, <b>then</b> <b>both</b> the Prime Minister and Naval Minister of the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860, {{shortly before the}} {{unification}} of Italy. The ships were originally intended to be armored floating batteries, but they were redesigned as sea-going ironclads after construction began. These ships were the first components of a major naval expansion program {{that was designed to}} prepare a fleet of ironclad warships capable of defeating the Austrian Navy. Italy considered the Austrian Empire to be its main rival, since it controlled predominantly Italian areas, including Venice.|$|E

5|$|A {{fortnight}} later, Miller {{proceeded to}} the Second Test in Sydney, {{where he had}} a quiet match without his partner Lindwall, who was sidelined with chickenpox. England batted first and Miller opened the bowling with Victorian teammate and debutant Fred Freer. Miller bowled nine overs without success, conceding 24 runs as Hammond's tourists amassed 270. On a turning surface, nine of the English wickets fell to the spinners Johnson and McCool. In the hosts' reply, Miller contributed 40 with seven fours in a 63-run stand with Barnes as Australia reached 4/159. Bradman—who had dropped himself down the order—and Barnes <b>then</b> <b>both</b> scored 234 and put together a world record fifth-wicket partnership of 405 to propel Australia to 8/659 declared. Miller bowled 11 overs in the second innings, taking the wicket of Hutton who was out hit wicket after going on a short-lived attack that yielded 37 runs from 39 balls in 24 minutes. Hutton shaped to drive the last ball before lunch, and successfully made contact, but in following through, his bat slipped from his hand and clipped the stumps. Miller had a light bowling workload as Johnson and McCool took seven wickets between them for the innings and eight wickets each for the match as Australia completed another innings victory.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{learns that}} Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) and Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) are dating each other, {{which they have}} been holding in secrecy from him in order to make his breakup with Erin easier. Andy {{attempts}} to fire Pete, but Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) points out that he can not do this since Pete and Erin already disclosed their relationship. Erin and Pete <b>then</b> <b>both</b> lecture Andy about moving on, claiming that working alongside one's ex-lover {{does not have to be}} awkward. To refute this claim, Andy hires both Pete's ex-girlfriend Alice (Collette Wolfe) and Erin's ex-boyfriend Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods). After giving Pete and Erin time to appreciate how uncomfortable this is, he holds a meeting with them and their ex-lovers, leading the two couples to argue with each other. Andy tells the camera that seeing Erin and Pete unhappy has made him feel better.|$|E
5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, {{the castle}} was armed with nine 36-pounder guns, {{supported}} by further artillery batteries placed along the beach. To protect Deal, units of infantry and cavalry, called fencibles, were formed in 1794 by William Pitt the Younger– <b>then</b> <b>both</b> the Prime Minister and the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports– and in 1802 units of bombardiers recruited by Pitt carried out military exercises at the castle. The politician and banker Lord Carrington carried out {{improvements to the}} castle in 1802, apparently as a rival project to his friend Pitt's work at Walmer. According to Samuel Wilberforce, Carrington had hoped to charge {{the cost of the}} work to the Treasury, but when he attempted to submit the claims, they were rejected by Pitt and he had to pay for the improvements himself.|$|E

5|$|Following some fruitless negotiations, {{the women}} and {{children}} were allowed to leave the house, and <b>then</b> <b>both</b> sides began firing. After about an hour, McFarlane called a ceasefire; according to some, a white flag had been waved in the house. As McFarlane stepped into the open, a shot rang out from the house, and he fell mortally wounded. The enraged rebels then set fire to the house, including the slave quarters, and Kirkpatrick surrendered. The number of casualties at Bower Hill is unclear; McFarlane and one or two other militiamen were killed; one U.S. soldier may have died from wounds received in the fight. The rebels sent the U.S. soldiers away. Kirkpatrick, Lenox, and Presley Neville were kept as prisoners, but they later escaped.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Records {{found that}} the plane {{did not respond to}} his control column. Even with the control column turned {{all the way to the}} left, {{commanding}} maximum left aileron, and pulled all the way back, commanding maximum up elevatorinputs that would never be used together in normal flight, commanding a roll to the left and the aircraft's nose to risethe aircraft was instead banking to the right with the nose dropping. Haynes attempted to level the aircraft with his own control column, <b>then</b> <b>both</b> Haynes and Records tried using their control columns together, but the aircraft still did not respond. Afraid the aircraft would roll into a completely inverted position (an unrecoverable situation), the crew reduced the left wingmounted engine to idle and applied maximum power to the right engine. This caused the airplane to slowly level out.|$|E
5|$|Montejo was {{appointed}} alcalde mayor (a local colonial governor) of Tabasco in 1529, and pacified that province {{with the aid}} of his son, also named Francisco de Montejo. D'Avila was sent from eastern Yucatán to conquer Acalan, which extended southeast of the Laguna de Terminos. Montejo the Younger founded Salamanca de Xicalango as a base of operations. In 1530 D'Avila established Salamanca de Acalán as a base from which to launch new attempts to conquer Yucatán. Salamanca de Acalán proved a disappointment, with no gold for the taking and with lower levels of population than had been hoped. D'Avila soon abandoned the new settlement and set off across the lands of the Kejache to Champotón, arriving there towards the end of 1530. During a colonial power struggle in Tabasco, the elder Montejo was imprisoned for a time. Upon his release, he met up with his son in Xicalango, Tabasco, and they <b>then</b> <b>both</b> rejoined d'Avila at Champotón.|$|E

5|$|Some of the Device Forts {{worked in}} {{conjunction}} with the volunteer units raised during the wars to counter the threat of a French invasion. Walmer Castle was used by its captain William Pitt the Younger – <b>then</b> <b>both</b> the Prime Minister and the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports – as the base for volunteer cavalry unit and a fleet of 35 armed fishing boats called luggers. Nearby Deal also had units of infantry and cavalry, called fencibles and in 1802 units of bombardiers recruited by Pitt carried out military exercises at the castle. Calshot was used to store munitions for nearby Sea Fencibles. Pendennis held a new volunteer artillery unit, which was used to train other garrisons across Cornwall.|$|E
