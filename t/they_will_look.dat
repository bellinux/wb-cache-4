25|$|One of the {{drawbacks}} of cosmetic lenses is {{not knowing how}} <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> before physically trying them on. This {{has led to an}} industry where lens retailers are heavily influenced by cutting edge digital fashion technology, specifically the Virtual Dressing Room technology. Virtual Dressing Room technology offers users the option to upload a photo so they can virtually try on different lenses and experience how <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> before committing to a purchase. Examples of retailers that currently offer this technology are Freshlook Color Studios and Colorful Eyes.|$|E

25|$|If {{the people}} {{come to believe that}} the {{constitution}} is not a text like other texts; if it means, not what it says or what it was understood to mean, but what it should mean, in light of the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> for qualifications other than impartiality, judgment, and lawyerly acumen in those whom they elect to interpret it. More specifically, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> for people who agree with them as to what those evolving standards have evolved to; who agree with them as to what the constitution ought to be. If the courts are free to write the constitution anew, they will write it the way the majority wants; the appointment and confirmation process will see to that. This suggests the end of the Bill of Rights, whose meaning will be committed to the very body it was meant to protect against: the majority. By trying to make the constitution do everything that needs doing from age to age, we shall have caused it to do nothing at all.|$|E

In May 2011, a PATH train crashed in the basement of Hoboken Terminal, causing minor injuries. Investigators said that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> into the possibility that the 2011 and 2016 accidents may have similar causes and circumstances.

25|$|The Judges {{themselves}} are not exempt from the law; in fact {{they are expected to}} obey it more strictly than any other. A violation that would earn a citizen a few months in an Iso-Cube would get a Judge a twenty-year sentence, served as hard labor on Saturn's moon, Titan, after surgical modification to enable the convict to survive outside there without needing an expensive space suit. (Titan is a moon of Saturn in reality, but was located over Jupiter in an early Dredd strip.) When Judges do make a minor mistake (anything were the citizen is alive or not in an intensive care ward) such as wrongful arrest or search they do have to pay the citizen a compensation fee if there is no crimes to be charged with. On that basis, if they can't find any evidence for the main charge, then <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> for any minor crime or misdemeanours to charge to citizen with to get themselves off the hook.|$|E
25|$|Residents {{may also}} choose to purchase, or rent, land from another Resident (a Resident landlord) {{rather than from}} Linden Lab. On a private region, the {{built-in}} land selling controls allow the landlord to sell land {{in the region to}} another Resident while still retaining some control. Residents purchasing, or renting, land from any other party than Linden Lab are not required to hold a Premium membership nor to necessarily pay a tier fee, although typically the landlord will require some form of upfront or monthly fee to compensate them for their liability to pay the land use fee charged by Linden Lab. However Linden Lab acknowledges only the landlord as the owner of the land, and will not intervene in disputes between Residents. This means, for example, that a landlord can withdraw a Resident's land from availability, without refunding their money, and Linden Lab will not arbitrate in the dispute unless it is a clear-cut matter of 'land fraud'. Users can report such matters to Linden Lab if they occur and <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> into it.|$|E

25|$|During {{the period}} of the Asian {{financial}} crisis, however, the temple was subject to widespread criticism for its fundraising methods and teachings, Luang Por Dhammajayo was eventually charged with embezzlement and removed from his office as abbot. In 2006, the charges were withdrawn and he was restored as abbot. The temple grew further in the following years and became known for its many projects in education, promotion of ethics, and scholarship in Thai society. The temple's movement developed an international scope, as of 2007, the temple's following was estimated at one million practitioners worldwide and thirty to fifty international centers outside of Thailand. Under the 2014 military junta, the abbot and the temple were put under scrutiny again and Luang Por Dhammajayo was accused of receiving stolen money of a supporter and money-laundering. This incident led to several standoffs between the temple and the junta, eventually leading to 23 day lock down of the temple in 2017 by the junta that made headlines worldwide. In the aftermath of the lock down the junta stated <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> for Luang Por Dhammajayo elsewhere but continued its scrutiny of the temple, giving the vice abbot, Luang Por Dattajivo several charges as well.|$|E
25|$|Node lookups {{can proceed}} asynchronously. The {{quantity}} of simultaneous lookups is denoted by α and is typically three. A node initiates a FIND_NODE request by querying to the α nodes {{in its own}} k-buckets that are the closest ones to the desired key. When these recipient nodes receive the request, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> in their k-buckets and return the k closest nodes to the desired key that they know. The requester will update a results list with the results (node ID's) he receives, keeping the k best ones (the k nodes that are closer to the searched key) that respond to queries. Then the requester will select these k best results and issue the request to them, and iterate this process again and again. Because every node has a better knowledge of his own surroundings than any other node has, the received results will be other nodes that are every time {{closer and closer to}} the searched key. The iterations continue until no nodes are returned that are closer than the best previous results. When the iterations stop, the best k nodes in the results list are the ones in the whole network that are the closest to the desired key.|$|E

However, in February 2013, Double Fine announced that a Windows version of the game will be released on February 26, 2013.

The multiplayer aspects of the PC version include a number of tweaks that Double Fine had tracked that they wanted to have made to the console version but could not do; while the full list of changes are not expected to be present in the initial PC release, Schafer has stated that if sales of the PC version are successful, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> at adding new units, factions, and gameplay modes that they had originally scoped out for the console version.

500|$|The Florida Territorial Council {{passed laws}} forbidding interracial {{marriage}} {{and the right of}} free blacks or mixed race descendants to inherit property. To avoid difficulties with the new government in what he termed its [...] "spirit of intolerant prejudice", Kingsley sent his wives, children, and a few slaves to Haiti, by that time free black republic. [...] His two daughters had already each married white planters and remained in Florida. He sold the plantation to his nephew, Kingsley Beatty Gibbs in 1839, and transferred some of the slaves to his plantation in San Jose, now a neighborhood in Jacksonville. Kingsley started a plantation in Haiti that was worked by former Fort George Island slaves, who had become indentured servants; slavery was not allowed in Haiti. [...] They were to earn their freedom in nine years. In 1842 Kingsley gave an interview to the abolitionist Lydia Child.

2500|$|Theories {{derived from}} early unilingual {{research}} relied mainly upon generalizations without precise specification {{of how these}} specific systems of lexical access works. Due {{to the advancement of}} medical science within the last decade, the field of Psycholinguistics has evolved immensely, resulting in more detailed research and therefore, {{a deeper understanding of the}} mechanisms behind language production. [...] "Many early studies of second language acquisition focused on the morphosyntactic development of learners, and the general findings was that bound morphemes appear in the same order in the first and second language"(Bardovi-Harlig 1999. In addition, [...] "second language learners are also able to produce and process simple sentences before complex sentences" [...] (Pienemann et al.2005), just like first language learners. For example, the theory of serial search models and parallel access models. Serial Search Models propose that when monolinguals encounter a word, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> through all the lexical entries to distinguish whether the input item is a word not, and then they will only retrieve the necessary information about that word (i.e., its semantics or orthography). They also propose that the lexical access would process sequentially by activating only one lexical entry at a time. In contrast, the Parallel Access Models believe that multiple entries can be activated at once, which means that the perceptual input from a word would activate all lexical items directly, even though some of them might not be necessary. In this way, numbers of potential candidates would be activated simultaneously and then the lexical candidates which are most consistent with the input stimulus would be chosen. [...] Later, the researchers addressed that both the serial and parallel process are accounted for the lexical organization and lexical access.|$|E
