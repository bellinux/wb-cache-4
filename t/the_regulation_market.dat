30|$|Another {{approach}} is the one of Kamboj et al. [5], which proposes the formation of coalitions among EVs in order to operate in <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>market.</b> The goal of <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>market</b> is to bring stability to the grid by ensuring that it always meets the demand. <b>The</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>market</b> basically provides power to the grid whenever demand exceeds supply, and store energy whenever supply exceeds demand. To provide energy, the market usually depends on large batteries (can readily store and supply energy, but are very expensive) and generators (can generate energy, {{but they are very}} polluting and take some time to start working). Thus, considering that vehicles remain parked 96 % of the time [2], the use of EVs’ batteries would help to reduce costs and to improve efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>market.</b> However, such approach addresses coalition formation in an ad hoc fashion, disregarding the solution quality.|$|E

30|$|Without loss of generality, we {{may well}} {{conclude}} that the aggregator, which possesses the ability to access the wholesale electricity market and conduct optimization based on the distributed battery characteristics, can flexibly allocate the biddings among different batteries. As a result, it is more economically feasible to operate distributed batteries than consumer-based ones. In addition, revenues from <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>market</b> play a more vital role in the total profits than revenues from simply conducting energy arbitrary. Moreover, compared to <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>market</b> without such a mechanism, the PBR mechanism enables batteries to gain {{a considerable amount of}} additional profit.|$|E
30|$|Comparing Figs.  6 and 9, {{it can be}} {{concluded}} that if the batteries are operated by consumers themselves, the battery utilization rate is relatively low. However, when batteries are operated by the aggregator for joint optimizing between the energy market and <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>market,</b> battery resources can be used more effectively.|$|E

However, the PtG plants can only reduce their electricity consumptions for reserve purposes, similar to the regulation up service in <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>market.</b> Considering the reserve market prices are generally much lower than that of the regulation service market, it is foreseeable that the PtG plants are not likely to benefit considerably from the reserve market. However, the combined participation in regulation and reserve market could be the optimal solution for the PtG plants. For an ideal case where the reserve service will not be dispatched, the PtG plants will gain additional income for the reserve capacity. If the reserve market price is 5 $/MW [28], the considered PtG plant will get extra 360 $ each day, based on the model (13)–(26).|$|E

30|$|In {{the smart}} grid paradigm, {{buildings}} can be aggregated to place load reduction bids in the day-ahead market. In this way, the aggregated TCLs {{act as a}} virtual power plant (VPP) [11]. It can ‘generate more power’ to the grid by turning off some TCLs to decrease the load and can ‘generate less power’ by turning some TCLs on. Once the load reduction contracts are determined for the day-ahead market, the differences between actual load shedding amounts and contracted load reduction volumes will be settled in <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>market.</b> Therefore, after determining the day-ahead contracts, the TCL aggregators need to optimize the real-time control actions on TCLs by {{taking into account the}} contracts and real-time information (e.g., regulation prices, weather information, etc.). Although there have been several works studying the TCL control schemes of in <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>market,</b> e.g., [12, 13], they all consider TCL aggregators as ancillary service providers to follow certain frequency regulation signals.|$|E

40|$|The {{valuation}} of an electricity storage device {{is based on}} the expected future cash ow generated by the device. Two potential sources of income for an electricity storage system are energy arbitrage and participation in the frequency regulation market. Energy arbitrage refers to purchasing (stor- ing) energy when electricity prices are low, and selling (discharging) energy when electricity prices are high. Frequency regulation is an ancillary service geared towards maintaining system frequency, and is typically procured by the independent system operator in some type of market. This paper outlines the calculations required to estimate the maximum potential revenue from participating in these two activities. First, a mathematical model is presented for the state of charge {{as a function of the}} storage device parameters and the quantities of electricity purchased/sold as well as the quantities o ered into <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>market.</b> Using this mathematical model, we present a linear programming optimization approach to calculating the maximum potential revenue from an elec- tricity storage device. The calculation of the maximum potential revenue is critical in developing an upper bound on the value of storage, as a benchmark for evaluating potential trading strate- gies, and a tool for capital nance risk assessment. Then, we use historical California Independent System Operator (CAISO) data from 2010 - 2011 to evaluate the maximum potential revenue from the Tehachapi wind energy storage project, an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) energy storage demonstration project. We investigate the maximum potential revenue from two di erent scenarios: arbitrage only and arbitrage combined with <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>market.</b> Our analysis shows that participation in <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>market</b> produces four times the revenue compared to arbitrage in the CAISO market using 2010 and 2011 data. Then we evaluate several trading strategies to illustrate how they compare to the maximum potential revenue benchmark. We conclude with a sensitivity analysis with respect to key parameters...|$|E

40|$|For {{wind power}} to {{participate}} in the short-term power market, forecasts up to 36 hours ahead of the hour of operation are required. These forecasts are never perfect, and the resulting wind power mismatch implies imbalance costs for the participant in <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>market.</b> Bidding the expected forecast in the day-ahead market is sub-optimal, as the difference between the day-ahead spot price and upward and downward regulation price is different. If the traded volume on <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>market</b> is low and the mismatched energy is high, this {{will have an impact on}} the imbalance price. This research aims to find a bidding strategy for stand-alone wind power in the day-ahead market that includes the price elasticity of <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>market.</b> The imbalance costs can be further reduced by teaming the wind power with conventional power that can balance out the mismatches. Hence, a bidding strategy for a mixed portfolio is also proposed. For both bidding strategies the value of the wind forecast service and its accuracy are also simulated. The ethics and social welfare of the bidding strategies are then examined. The bidding strategies were simulated in the Dutch market for 2006. For stand-alone wind power in the day-ahead market the proposed bidding strategy resulted in a profit increase of 3. 5 % compared to the well-known optimal quantile bidding strategy and 7. 5 % compared to bidding the expected generation. Teaming the wind power with gas power to balance out the mismatch gave a profit increase of 9. 6 % compared to separate bidding in the day-ahead market. The profit of teaming is greatly reduced by the capacity reserves that the conventional unit need to withhold in order to balance out the mismatch. In reality, the excess reserve capacity can be bid at the balancing market when the hour of operation approaches and the expected wind power generation can be more accurately estimated. This strategy may increase the mixed portfolio profit substantially. For wind farms bidding alone in the day-ahead market the profits are strongly affected by the level of wind forecast accuracy. For the 200 MW capacity wind farm used in this simulation, the profit increase was 11 million euros for a 10 percentage point decrease in the standard deviation of the wind forecast error, if the initial forecast had 25 % standard deviation. The dependency was greatly reduced when teamed with a 400 MW conventional unit. The same decrease in wind forecast error now resulted in a profit increase of 5 million euros. The bidding strategies do not violate bidding rules and was found to decrease the total amount of regulation power needed. It is not possible to exploit the difference in market price between the day-ahead market and <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>market,</b> as assumptions the bidding strategy is based upon prevent the possibility of market arbitrage. The cooperation between the conventional unit and the wind farm will create a player in the market that has more power to affect the prices versus participants bidding separately in the market. However, the bidding strategy is based on a price-taking assumption for the day-ahead market and since any involvement in the balancing market is assumed to only decrease the profit, no market power will be exploited using this strategy. 	 Social welfare is unchanged by the bidding strategy. Depending on the regulation state and the traded imbalance value, there is a transfer of surplus between supplier and consumer in the day-ahead market and <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>market.</b> For the wind farm there is a total gain of surplus, making wind power a more compatible investment option versus other conventional power sources to meet the rising electricity demand. As an environmental energy source this can have a positive impact on the social welfare in the long run. However, examining the environmental benefits is a more complex analysis including analysis of the environmental effects of the balance responsible conventional unit. </p...|$|E
30|$|In contrast, when {{batteries}} are {{operated by the}} aggregator in Scenario 1, the profit is considerable. When the revenue in the energy market is negative, {{the main source of}} revenue is the participation in <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>market.</b> Although the capacity revenue is higher than the mileage revenue, the latter does occupy a considerable part of the profits. Without the mileage revenue brought by the PBR mechanism, the aggregator’s total profits will decrease by 25.17 %. The greatest portion of the total costs consists of battery degradation costs. Therefore, the aggregator focuses most on degradation costs to reduce the costs.|$|E
30|$|Another major {{application}} for batteries is providing ancillary services, which compromise {{a wide range}} of offerings, such as synchronized reserve, non-synchronized service and regulation service. Among these, regulation service is especially lucrative. Compared with the traditional regulation resources, batteries have a higher ramp rate and can respond faster. However, because compensation is based on the committed capacity, regulation markets currently usually fail to consider the actual performance of regulation resources. To handle this problem, the FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) Order 755 [17] has developed pay-for-performance tariffs, which take both the speed and accuracy of providing frequency regulation into consideration, thus remedying the undue discrimination. This makes the regulation service increasingly lucrative for batteries. When batteries participate in <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>market,</b> they need to be engaged in the energy market so that they can meet the energy balance demand. Many scholars have conducted research on the joint optimization of the energy market and <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>market,</b> but fail to consider the performance based regulation (PBR) mechanism. J. Cho and A.N. Kleit developed a probability model to accommodate the PBR mechanism and calculated the net present value of many years’ income based on the discount rate [18]. G. He, Q. Chen, C. Kang et al. proposed a battery storage optimal bidding strategy in the joint day-ahead market, with the consideration of the PBR mechanism and battery cycle life model, which makes the economic evaluation of storage more accurate [19].|$|E

30|$|Moreover, most of {{the works}} above are {{concerned}} with bulk batteries.

However, this assumption is mismatched from actual circumstances: distributed batteries often contain equipment in different conditions, with different technical characteristics. The current study investigates different types of batteries and chooses the lithium-ion battery as the desirable distributed battery. Characteristic differences among these specific batteries are included in the analysis. In addition, this study considers the market participations of the distributed battery aggregators in the wholesale energy market and <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>market</b> with the PBR mechanism.

The differences mainly exist in these aspects: a) the individual battery could not gain regulation market revenue, and regulation market constraints are thus discarded; b) the object function is the profit of every individual battery, not the total profits of all distributed batteries.|$|E
