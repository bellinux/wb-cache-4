Norman Haire, who was the star witness after Havelock Ellis bowed out, declared that homosexuality ran in families and a person could no more become it by reading books than if he could become syphilitic by reading about syphilis.

500|$|Thompson {{viewed the}} novel as a story of [...] "love and money," [...] noting that some people needed one more than the other. During the writing process, {{executive}} producer Sydney Pollack stressed that the film be understandable to modern audiences, and that it be made clear why the Dashwood sisters could not just obtain a job. [...] "I'm from Indiana; if I get it, everyone gets it," [...] he said. Thompson believed that Austen was just as comprehensible in a different century, [...] "You don't <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> still concerned with marriage, money, romance, finding a partner?" [...] She was keen to emphasise the realism of the Dashwoods' predicament in her screenplay, and inserted scenes to make the differences in wealth more apparent to modern audiences. Thompson made the Dashwood family richer than {{in the book and}} added elements to help contrast their early wealth with their later financial predicament; for instance, because it might have been confusing to viewers that one could be poor and still have servants, Elinor is made to address a large group of servants at Norland Park early in the film for viewers to remember when they see their few staff at Barton Cottage. Lee also sought to emphasise social class and the limitations it placed on the protagonists. Lee conveys this in part when Willoughby publicly rejects Marianne; he returns to a more lavishly furnished room, a symbol of the wealth she has lost. [...] "Family dramas," [...] he stated, [...] "are all about conflict, about family obligations versus free will." ...|$|E
