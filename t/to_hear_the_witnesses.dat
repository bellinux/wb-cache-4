5000|$|In 1905, {{as part of}} {{a series}} of lectures on the {{relationship}} between the church and the state, Algernon Sidney Crapsey made statements which were understood to challenge the doctrines of the virgin birth, the bodily resurrection and the divinity of Jesus. A committee appointed to review his case declined to recommend a trial, but condemned his teaching. Considerable controversy ensued, and in 1906 the Bishop initiated a [...] on two counts of heresy and appointed a court <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> case. <b>Witnesses</b> called <b>to</b> support the orthodoxy of Crapsey's views were not allowed to testify, and Crapsey was convicted. On appeal the conviction was upheld. Crapsey resigned and never took another church position.|$|R
5|$|As the Director-General was {{a public}} officer {{appointed}} by statute to discharge public duties, he was subject to an order of prohibition in an appropriate case. The Court found that on the affidavit evidence produced by the applicants, the Director-General could not reasonably {{have come to the}} conclusion he came <b>to</b> without <b>hearing</b> <b>the</b> applicants' <b>witnesses.</b> He had thus misdirected himself on the law as to the nature of the evidence that was required to be produced to prove the export of the goods. Finally, there had been an insufficient inquiry which had resulted in a failure to take into account relevant considerations, and an investigation that was unfair to the applicant. The Court therefore made an order of prohibition against the Director-General to prevent him from deducting money from the bankers' guarantees.|$|R
5000|$|Such beliefs clearly {{projected}} contemporary practices {{back to the}} 1st century, and {{in their}} developed form are not found before the lead-up to the Iconoclastic Controversy, but in the 4th century, Eusebius, who disapproved of images, accepted that [...] "the features of His apostles Peter and Paul, and indeed of Christ himself, have been preserved in coloured portraits which I have examined". [...] Many famous images, including the Image of Edessa and Hodegetria, were described in versions of their stories as this type of image. The belief that images presumably of the 6th century at the earliest were authentic products of the 1st century distorted any sense of stylistic anachronism, {{making it easier for}} further images to be accepted, just as the belief in acheiropoieta, which must have reflected a divine standard of realism and accuracy, distorted early medieval perceptions of what degree of realism was possible in art, accounting for the praise very frequently given to images for their realism, when to modern eyes the surviving corpus has little of this. The standard depictions of both the features of the leading New Testament figures, and the iconography of key narrative scenes, seemed to have their authenticity confirmed by images believed to have been created either by direct witnesses or those able <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> accounts of <b>witnesses,</b> or alternatively God himself or his angels.|$|R

50|$|On 22 October 2010, {{when the}} trial was nearing its conclusion, Wilders's {{attorney}} Moszkowicz asked for the judges to be substituted because of a perceived bias against his client. Moszkowicz had unsuccessfully asked for substitution before. The second request was made because Tom Schalken, one of the judges {{in the court of}} appeal case that ordered the prosecution of Wilders on 21 January 2009 had allegedly tried to convince a <b>witness</b> in <b>the</b> main trial, Hans Jansen, that {{the trial was}} justified. Moszkowicz wanted <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> this <b>witness</b> immediately regarding <b>the</b> alleged conflict of interest, but the court decided it would not <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness.</b> <b>The</b> substitution chamber decided that this decision had an appearance of bias and awarded the substitution, thereby ordering a retrial.|$|R
