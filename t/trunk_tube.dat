The develop-mental potential of mouse neural crest in vitro {{was shown to}} be essentially {{similar to that of}} avian neural crest. In the mouse, however, melanocytes always appeared in association with the epithelial sheet close to the explant. Neural crest cells surrounding the epithelial sheet, which probably migrated from the neural tubes in the early culture phase, never differen-tiated into melanocytes. The bimodal behaviour of mouse crest cells seems to be due to the heterogenous potency of the crest cells and the interaction of these cells with the surround-ing microenvironment.

We analyzed the molecular mechanisms of posterior neural development and axis formation regulated by eve 1. We show that eve 1 is involved in establishing trunk and tail neural ectoderm by two independent mechanisms: First, eve 1 posteriorizes neural ectoderm via induction of aldh 1 a 2, which encodes an enzyme that synthesizes retinoic acid; second, eve 1 is involved in neural induction in the posterior ectoderm by attenuating BMP expression. Further, eve 1 can restore <b>trunk</b> neural <b>tube</b> formation in the organizer-deficient ichabod −/− mutant.

40|$|The enteric {{nervous system}} of jawed {{vertebrates}} arises primarily from vagal neural crest cells that {{migrate to the}} foregut and subsequently colonize and innervate the entire gastrointestinal tract. Here we examine development of the enteric nervous system in the basal jawless vertebrate the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) to gain insight into its evolutionary origin. Surprisingly, we find no evidence {{for the existence of}} a vagally derived enteric neural crest population in the lamprey. Rather, labelling with the lipophilic dye DiI shows that late-migrating cells, originating from the <b>trunk</b> neural <b>tube</b> and associated with nerve fibres, differentiate into neurons within the gut wall and typhlosole. We propose that these trunk-derived neural crest cells may be homologous to Schwann cell precursors, recently shown in mammalian embryos to populate post-embryonic parasympathetic ganglia, including enteric ganglia. Our results suggest that neural-crest-derived Schwann cell precursors made an important contribution to the ancient enteric nervous system of early jawless vertebrates, a role that was largely subsumed by vagal neural crest cells in early gnathostomes...|$|R

The results show that this subunit is prevalent in cells of the developing nervous system and muscle. α_ 6 is first observed on neuroepithelial cells of the cranial neural plate and <b>trunk</b> neural <b>tube.</b> With time, immunoreactivity becomes prominent near the lumen and ventrolateral portions of the neural tube, co-distributing with neurons and axons, particularly notable on commissural neurons.

40|$|Abstract Background Vertebrate neural {{development}} requires precise {{coordination of}} cell proliferation and cell specification to guide orderly transition of mitotically active precursor cells into {{different types of}} post-mitotic neurons and glia. Lateral inhibition, mediated by the Delta-Notch signaling pathway, may provide a mechanism to regulate proliferation and specification in the vertebrate nervous system. We examined delta and notch gene expression in zebrafish embryos and tested the role of lateral inhibition in spinal cord patterning by ablating cells and genetically disrupting Delta-Notch signaling. Results Zebrafish embryos express multiple delta and notch genes throughout the developing nervous system. All or most proliferative precursors appeared to express notch genes whereas subsets of precursors and post-mitotic neurons expressed delta genes. When we ablated identified primary motor neurons soon after they were born, they were replaced, indicating that specified neurons laterally inhibit neighboring precursors. Mutation of a delta gene caused precursor cells of the <b>trunk</b> neural <b>tube</b> to cease dividing prematurely and develop as neurons. Additionally, mutant embryos had excess early specified neurons, with fates appropriate for their normal positions within the neural tube, and a concomitant deficit of late specified cells. Conclusions Our {{results are consistent with}} the idea that zebrafish Delta proteins, expressed by newly specified neurons, promote Notch activity in neighboring precursors. This signaling is required to maintain a proliferative precursor population and generate late-born neurons and glia. Thus, Delta-Notch signaling may diversify vertebrate neural cell fates by coordinating cell cycle control and cell specification. </p...|$|R
40|$|Neural crest cells (NCCs) {{arising from}} <b>trunk</b> neural <b>tube</b> (NT) during primary and {{secondary}} neurulation give rise to melanocytes, glia and neurons, except {{for those in the}} caudal-most region during secondary neurulation (somites 47 to 53 in the chick embryo), from which no neurons are formed, either in vivo or in vitro. To elucidate this discrepancy, we have specifically analyzed caudal-most NCC ontogeny. In this region, NCCs emerge at E 5 /HH 26, one day after full cavitation of the NT and differentiation of flanking somites. The absence of neurons does not seem to result from a defect in NCC specification as all the usual markers, with the exception of Msx 1, are expressed in the dorsal caudal-most NT as early as E 4 /HH 24. However, Bmp 4 -Wnt 1 signaling, which triggers trunk NCC delamination, is impaired in this region due to persistence of noggin (Nog) expression. Concomitantly, a spectacular pattern of apoptosis occurs in the NT dorsal moiety. Rostral transplantation of either the caudal-most somites or caudal-most NT reveals that the observed features of caudal-most NCCs relate to properties intrinsic to these cells. Furthermore, by forced Nog expression in the trunk NT, we can reproduce most of these particular features. Conversely, increased Bmp 4 -Wnt 1 signaling through Nog inhibition in the caudal-most NT at E 4 /HH 24 induces proneurogenic markers in migratory NCCs, suggesting that noggin plays a role in the lack of neurogenic potential characterizing the caudal-most NCCs.

40|$|AbstractRecent {{studies show}} that {{specification}} of some neural crest lineages occurs prior to or {{at the time of}} migration from the neural tube. We investigated what signaling events establish the melanocyte lineage, which has been shown to migrate from the <b>trunk</b> neural <b>tube</b> after the neuronal and glial lineages. Using in situ hybridization, we find that, although Wnts are expressed in the dorsal neural tube throughout the time when neural crest cells are migrating, the Wnt inhibitor cfrzb- 1 is expressed in the neuronal and glial precursors and not in melanoblasts. This expression pattern suggests that Wnt signaling may be involved in specifying the melanocyte lineage. We further report that Wnt- 3 a-conditioned medium dramatically increases the number of pigment cells in quail neural crest cultures while decreasing the number of neurons and glial cells, without affecting proliferation. Conversely, BMP- 4 is expressed in the dorsal neural tube throughout the time when neural crest cells are migrating, but is decreased coincident with the timing of melanoblast migration. This expression pattern suggests that BMP signaling may be involved in neural and glial cell differentiation or repression of melanogenesis. Purified BMP- 4 reduces the number of pigment cells in culture while increasing the number of neurons and glial cells, also without affecting proliferation. Our data suggest that Wnt signaling specifies melanocytes {{at the expense of the}} neuronal and glial lineages, and further, that Wnt and BMP signaling have antagonistic functions in the specification of the trunk neural crest...|$|R

In the present study, we have analyzed NEDD 9 mRNA expression in the mouse and identified new relevant expression sites. In addition, we have characterized NEDD 9 protein expression pattern {{for the first time}} in mammals. At E 9. 5 -E 10. 5, high levels of Nedd 9 and the neurogenic transcription factor neurogenin- 2 (Ngn 2) were found to largely overlap in two discrete domains of the <b>trunk</b> neural <b>tube</b> along its dorso-ventral axis, with Nedd 9 extending to more ventral regions of the ventricular zone and Ngn 2 differentially expressed in neuronally committed progenitors of the intermediate zone.

A sharp down-regulation of NEDD 9 expression was found in cells upon lineage commitment, as observed in Nurr 1 (+) and Ngn 2 (+) mesencephalic dopaminergic and brainstem neuronal progenitors. In other tissues/organs, i. e. prospective heart, retina, olfactory epithelium, gonads, cartilage, gut and pituitary gland, NEDD 9 was found to be co-expressed with Sox 2, RXR alpha and/or Nurr 1 -like proteins, suggesting that NEDD 9 expression is confined to early progenitors involved in diverse organogenesis and that it may depend on the repertoire and levels of retinoic acid co-receptors expressed by those cells...|$|R
40|$|Injury to a {{peripheral}} nerve {{is followed by}} local synthesis and release of neurotrophic factors of importance for the regeneration process. This concept was adopted for repair of transected human median and ulnar nerves in the forearm. As an alternative to conventional microsurgical repair of the nerve <b>trunk,</b> silicone <b>tubes</b> of appropriate size were used to enclose the injury zone, intentionally leaving a gap measuring 3 - 4 mm between the nerve ends inside the tube. The early results from a prospective, randomized, clinical study comparing this principle with conventional microsurgical technique for repair of human median and ulnar nerves, is presented. Eighteen patients (14 men and 4 women), aged 12 - 72 (mean, 29. 5) years, were randomized to either tubulization (11 cases) or conventional microsurgical repair (7 cases).

ISM 1 was identified in the frog embryo {{as a member of the}} FGF 8 synexpression group due to its expression in the brain midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB) or isthmus. In zebrafish, ISM 1 was described as a WNT- and NODAL-regulated gene. The function of ISM 1 remains largely elusive. So far, ISM 1 has been described as an angiogenesis inhibitor that has a dual function in endothelial cell survival and cell death. For a better understanding of ISM 1 function, we examined its spatiotemporal distribution in mouse and chick using RT-PCR, ISH, and IHC analyses. In the mouse, ISM 1 transcripts are found in tissues such as the anterior mesendoderm, paraxial and lateral plate mesoderm, MHB and <b>trunk</b> neural <b>tube,</b> as well as in the somites and dermomyotome. In the newborn and adult, ISM 1 is prominently expressed in the lung and brain. In addition to its putative role during embryonic and postnatal development, ISM 1 may also be important for organ homeostasis in the adult. In the chick embryo, ISM 1 transcripts are strongly detected in the ear, eye, and spinal cord primordia.

Cells were isolated from paraxial mesoderm and limb buds of transgenic mouse embryos at 9. 5 days after conception and grown in culture at clonal density either on collagen-coated dishes or on various feeder cell layers. The transgene used contained a reporter gene encoding beta-galactosidase {{with a nuclear}} localization signal {{under the control of}} regulatory sequences from the gene for fast myosin light chain 3, so that beta-galactosidase staining indicated the presence of differentiated muscle cells. After 5 days in culture, the number and size of beta-galactosidase-positive (beta-gal+) clones were recorded. Cells isolated from somites I-V (the last five somites to have formed) or from unsegmented paraxial mesoderm did not give rise to any beta-gal+ clones. Cells isolated from somites VI-X or from the forelimb bud gave rise to beta-gal+ clones, but only on feeder cells. Cells from somites XI or older gave rise to beta-gal+ clones independently of the substrate. However, when cells isolated from unsegmented paraxial mesoderm or somites I-V were cultured with nontransgenic cells from the <b>trunk</b> (including neural <b>tube</b> and notochord), differentiation occurred on condition that the cells were in a three-dimensional aggregate, even though their specific position in the somite had been lost.

40|$|Genetic {{studies in}} worms, flies, and humans have implicated the presenilins in the {{regulation}} of the Notch signaling pathway and in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease. There are two highly homologous presenilin genes in mammals, presenilin 1 (PS 1) and presenilin 2 (PS 2). In mice, inactivation of PS 1 leads to developmental defects that culminate in a perinatal lethality. To test {{the possibility that the}} late lethality of PS 1 -null mice reflects genetic redundancy of the presenilins, we have generated PS 2 -null mice by gene targeting, and subsequently, PS 1 /PS 2 double-null mice. Mice homozygous for a targeted null mutation in PS 2 exhibit no obvious defects; however, loss of PS 2 on a PS 1 -null background leads to embryonic lethality at embryonic day 9. 5. Embryos lacking both presenilins, and surprisingly, those carrying only a single copy of PS 2 on a PS 1 -null background, exhibit multiple early patterning defects, including lack of somite segmentation, disorganization of the <b>trunk</b> ventral neural <b>tube,</b> midbrain mesenchyme cell loss, anterior neuropore closure delays, and abnormal heart and second branchial arch development. In addition, Delta like- 1 (Dll 1) and Hes- 5, two genes that lie downstream in the Notch pathway, were misexpressed in presenilin double-null embryos: Hes- 5 expression was undetectable in these mice, whereas Dll 1 was expressed ectopically in the neural tube and brain of double-null embryos. We conclude that the presenilins play a widespread role in embryogenesis, that there is a functional redundancy between PS 1 and PS 2, and that both vertebrate presenilins, like their invertebrate homologs, are essential for Notch signaling...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSoon {{after they}} {{segregate}} from the neural <b>tube,</b> <b>trunk</b> neural crest cells disperse on two spatially and temporally distinct pathways. Only crest cells that migrate early and ventromedially {{give rise to}} neurons of the peripheral nervous system. It is also known that neural crest cell-derived populations require appropriate environmental cues early in development in order to generate neurons, and for the subsequent survival of differentiated neurons. We examined whether neurotrophin- 3 (NT- 3), a survival factor for subsets of peripheral neurons, is also involved in the regulation of neurogenesis by neural crest cells. First, we found that premigratory and migrating neural crest cells on the medial migration pathway of Embryonic Day 2. 5 (E 2. 5) embryos express mRNAs encoding multiple isoforms of the NT- 3 receptor,trkC, as do cells in the neural tube and epithelial dermamyotome. On E 4, a subpopulation of neurons in nascent sensory ganglia expresstrkC message. Second, we demonstrate thattrkC mRNA is only expressed in neural crest cell populations that possess neurogenic potential. Third, we show {{that the presence of}} NT- 3, during the initial development of cultured neural crest cells, is required for neurogenesis by a subpopulation of neurogenic neural crest-derived cells. These results suggest that a subpopulation of neurogenic neural crest cells expresses functionaltrkC receptors and requires the timely availability of NT- 3 for their development before reaching their final embryonic locations. We suggest that developmental heterogeneity exists in the identity and requirements of neural crest cell subsets that harbor neurogenic potential. We also suggest that the “paradoxical” expression oftrkC receptors by the somitic dermamyotome may, in fact, {{play a role in the}} exclusive development of crest-derived neurogenic precursors on the medial pathway by limiting the availability of NT- 3 on the lateral pathway...|$|R
