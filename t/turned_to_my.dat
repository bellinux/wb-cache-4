500|$|Baywatch and Knight Rider star David Hasselhoff {{accepted}} the role when his daughters, Taylor-Ann and Hayley, urged him: [...] "I got {{an offer to}} do a cameo in the SpongeBob Movie and I <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> girls, who were like 16 and 14, and I said, 'Who's SpongeBob?' and they said, 'Oh my God, Dad, it's the number one cartoon in the world, you gotta do it.'" [...] Hasselhoff enjoyed his cameo: [...] "It was great fun {{and to this day}} around the world kids stop me and say, 'Are you David Hasselhoff?' because I was the only human in the picture." [...] Hasselhoff said that the film gained him new fans: [...] "It's amazing - so many of the kids were so young and didn't see Baywatch and Knight Rider so I got a whole new legion of fans." ...|$|E
500|$|The Heroes of the Lance are {{the protagonists}} of the Chronicles trilogy, the first series of Dragonlance books. They {{were created by}} Weis and Hickman, then fleshed out as player {{characters}} in gaming sessions of Dungeons & Dragons at Hickman's apartment. One player at this initial gaming session was game designer Terry Phillips, who was playing as Raistlin. According to Hickman in the foreword to The Soulforge, [...] " [...] were just settling in to the game when I <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> good friend Terry Phillips and asked what his character was doing. Terry spoke...and the world of Krynn was forever changed. His rasping voice, his sarcasm and bitterness all masking an arrogance and power that never needed to be stated suddenly were real. Everyone {{in the room was}} both transfixed and terrified. To this day Margaret [...] swears that Terry wore the black robes to the party that night." ...|$|E
500|$|Frank {{has been}} outspoken on many civil rights issues, {{including}} lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights. In 1987, he publicly {{came out as}} gay. In 1990, Frank was instrumental in crafting the 1990 Immigration Act, which restated the reasons for which a person could be denied entry into the country. [...] The act did not include [...] "sexual preference exclusion", reforming earlier immigration law which allowed persons to be excluded for a sexual deviance [...] "afflict". He said in a 1996 interview: [...] "I'm used to being in the minority. I'm a left-handed gay Jew. I've never felt, automatically, a member of any majority." [...] In 1995, then-Republican House Majority Leader Dick Armey famously referred to Frank as [...] "Barney Fag" [...] in a press interview. Armey apologized {{and said it was}} [...] "a slip of the tongue". Frank did not accept Armey's explanation, saying [...] "I <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> own expert, my mother, who reports that in 59 years of marriage, no one ever introduced her as Elsie Fag." [...] In 1998, Frank founded the National Stonewall Democrats, the national LGBT Democratic organization.|$|E
30|$|Having {{established}} that (yi)-ge heads an nP {{and takes the}} secondary predicate as its complement in a SGC, I now <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> analysis of TAc in the construction.|$|R
6000|$|I said, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> uncle, [...] "under the {{testimony}} {{that can be}} offered, and am surprised to hear you suggest a doubt of {{the result of the}} trial." ...|$|R
60|$|I obeyed automatically, proffering it to {{the lady}} who nearly {{withered}} me with a glance, and then to each <b>to</b> each in <b>turn.</b> <b>To</b> <b>my</b> relief the young man took one.|$|R
2500|$|W. B. Yeats {{refers to}} Llull twice in Rosa Alchemica, first {{published}} in 1897 ("I <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> last purchase, a set of alchemical apparatus which, the dealer in the Rue le Peletier had assured me, once belonged to Raymond Lully"; and [...] "There were the works [...] of Lully, who transformed himself into the likeness of a red cock"). It is also {{interesting to note that}} his [...] "first eight poems in The Green Helmet and Other Poems were published under the general title 'Raymond Lully and his wife Pernella'; an erratum-slip corrected this: 'AN ERROR By a slip of the pen when I was writing out the heading for the first group of poems, I put Raymond Lully's name in the room of the later Alchemist, Nicolas Flamel'".|$|E
60|$|Sir Lothian {{shrugged his}} shoulders, and looked blackly at the magistrate. Then he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> uncle.|$|E
60|$|Still repeating this word, I <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> pillow; {{and still}} repeating it, I steeped that pillow with tears.|$|E
6000|$|... "Which they {{certainly}} will do," [...] I continued. <b>Turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> wife and Aunt Martha, [...] "As {{you have heard}} this fine story, I think {{it is time for}} you to retire." ...|$|R
60|$|But, however, it was {{not without}} some little consequences, even at that time, and which gave a little <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> way of living at first, as you shall hear in its place.|$|R
6000|$|I <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> {{botanist}} almost reprovingly. [...] "You know, she won't {{be quite}} the same lady here that you knew in Frognal," [...] I say, and wrest myself from a subject {{that is no longer}} agreeable by rising <b>to</b> <b>my</b> feet.|$|R
60|$|From {{the boats}} they <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> costume. They {{could not make}} enough of my red sash; and my knife filled them with awe.|$|E
60|$|I <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> letters. One {{was from}} Lickford, with a Cornish postmark. I glanced {{through it and}} laid it aside for a more {{exhaustive}} perusal.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} me very searchingly, seeking in my countenance--as I now know--some trace of irony or guile. Finding none, he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> mother. He was very solemn.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{do you say}} to all this, Miss Warren," [...] I asked, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> companion, for by {{some secret}} {{influence}} I was walking at her side. [...] "Are you 'up canopy' or 'down canopy'?" ...|$|R
6000|$|An {{impressive}} silence ensued. The Judge arose, put on {{the black}} cap and in a voice trembling with emotion sentenced me to life and liberty. Then <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> counsel he said, coldly but significantly: ...|$|R
6000|$|But all the time, I felt ill at heart; and {{was filled}} with an {{undercurrent}} of dismal forebodings. But I strove to dispel them; and <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> companion, exclaimed, [...] "And pray, do you live here, Harry, in this Palace of Aladdin?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is my choice," [...] I declared. [...] "Right here we take root. This {{shall be}} the Garland Homestead." [...] I <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> father. [...] "When can you move?" ...|$|E
60|$|My father {{seemed to}} me to be on the eve of a collapse. His lips moved, and he mumbled something, but the words were wholly unintelligible. Ray <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> stepmother.|$|E
60|$|Adèle stooped down, but he eluded her. With a low growl he sprang {{through the}} opening, and {{fastened}} {{his teeth in}} my trousers. Adèle <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> cousin {{and her face was}} as pale as death.|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{she come}} forward and speak for herself?" [...] said Mrs. Bretton, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> corner; and at this invitation, forward I came. Graham courteously rose up to greet me. He stood tall on the hearth, a figure {{justifying}} his mother's unconcealed pride.|$|R
60|$|Sweeping {{a glance}} over the skittle-alley, he sent forth a long puff of smoke; then, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> {{companion}} (of the politer sex) {{with the air}} of one who has made himself perfect master of a foreign tongue, he smiled, and spoke.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} was," [...] I replied, {{with some}} embarrassment at the determined suddenness of the question, and then, endeavouring {{to give a}} complimentary <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> frank avowal--"How is it possible I should think of anything else, seated as I have the happiness to be?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> {{father and}} said: 'Is this true, my uncle?' And my father answered: 'Yes, {{that is the}} best bargain I could make with the Englishman, seeing that you were not here to make a better.'" ...|$|E
60|$|I frowned. It {{seemed to}} me the affair had now gone much too far. Lord Porthoning had {{staggered}} to a chair and was sitting there with his face buried in his hands. He was a stricken man. I <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> father-in-law.|$|E
6000|$|We were {{beginning}} to descend. In the distance below us already twinkled {{the lights in the}} solitary rancho of Lone Valley. I <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> companion. [...] "But you have forgotten that I don't even know your name. What am I to call you?" ...|$|E
50|$|Your <b>Turn</b> <b>to</b> Curtsy, <b>My</b> <b>Turn</b> <b>to</b> Bow is a 1958 novel from William Goldman.|$|R
60|$|Miss Sampson looked alarmed and Sally <b>turned</b> pale, <b>to</b> <b>my</b> extreme joy.|$|R
60|$|He went reluctantly {{into the}} house, and I <b>turned</b> again <b>to</b> <b>my</b> audience.|$|R
60|$|I felt {{proud to}} know that the liberties of Massachusetts and of our {{fatherland}} were in such safe keeping; and as I <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> hoeing again I was filled with an inexpressible confidence, and pursued my labor cheerfully with a calm trust in the future.|$|E
60|$|So he spoke, pronouncing in {{his strong}} Scotch accent the most {{carefully}} selected English I had ever heard. A hard-headed, square-shouldered, pertinaciously self-willed man--it was plainly useless {{to contend with}} him. I <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> mother's gentle face for encouragement; and I let my doctor have his own way.|$|E
6000|$|... "But, madam!--but, madam!" [...] exclaimed Varney anxiously, {{and still}} placing himself in her way, [...] "I trust that what I have spoken in humble duty and service {{will not be}} <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> ruin? I hope that my {{faithful}} advice will not be bewrayed to my prejudice? I implore that--" ...|$|E
60|$|Bishop Morehouse <b>turned</b> appealingly <b>to</b> <b>my</b> father, but {{he laughed}} and nodded his head.|$|R
60|$|I {{went and}} when I reached them, <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> look <b>my</b> last on her.|$|R
60|$|As I <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> meet <b>my</b> new foe it {{was with}} a heart {{considerably}} lightened.|$|R
