5|$|Obama's {{inaugural address}} {{received}} mixed reviews, with some describing {{the tone of}} <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> a praiseworthy one of restraint and plain speaking, while others described <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> as low-brow and cliched. Despite his optimism, Obama was critical of former Presidents GeorgeW. Bush and BillClinton. David E. Sanger, chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, described <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> as the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an inaugural address since Franklin Roosevelt's call for restoration of American values. The Bush administration was upset about the tone of <b>the</b> <b>speech,</b> saying that <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> veered {{from that of a}} ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe. Members of the Republican party viewed <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> as a missed chance to seek unity, while Rahm Emanuel, Obama's White House Chief of Staff, described <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> as a reflection of the mandate of the people. In an analysis of the inaugural address, one reporter described <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> as one that emphasized the burdens of the moment and the cloudy future whose challenges may be met with the resolve that is part of our American heritage.|$|E
5|$|While <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> {{revolves}} around the life of Neaira, this is of little importance to {{the substance of the}} accusations. The details seem to be part of <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> {{in the hope that the}} salacious accusations will hide the weakness of Apollodorus' case. The accuracy of the evidence given in <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> has been questioned, and is known to contain both lies and inaccuracies. Despite this, <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> tells us much about the life of an accomplished hetaera, and is extremely valuable to historians as a source on women's lives in classical Greece. Indeed, it is our most reliable extant source on prostitution in the classical world, and one of our best sources on women's lives and gender relations in general for the period.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>speeches</b> in Thucydides {{have long}} {{been a source of}} lively {{historical}} controversy. Many scholars have discounted their historical veracity in differing degrees. This has been true even of <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> of Pericles, particularly his famous Funeral Oration, although scholarly objections to the content and tone of <b>the</b> Periclean <b>speeches</b> have largely been of a purely subjective nature. However, an examination of how the Homeric h&d 5;,qov, with its stringent demand for the studied cultivation and possession of timh&d 12; and a,r 3 t h&d 12;, functions within <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> of Pericles as a key motivating force for the steadfast pursuance of a highly aggressive foreign policy, sheds an interesting light {{on the question of the}} historical nature of <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> and <b>the</b> outbreak of the Athenian-Peloponnesian War. In conjunction with this "Homeric reading" to <b>the</b> <b>speeches,</b> a further consideration of the more realistic analyses of modern manifestations of Realpolitik in the sphere of international politics and diplomacy, adduces additional support for the acceptance of <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> of Pericles as important forms of historical evidence for the basic workings of Machtpolitik...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>speeches</b> Against Stephanos (κατὰ Στεφάνου Ψευδομαρτυριῶν, [...] "Against Stephanos for bearing false witness") {{were two}} orations {{surviving}} in the Demosthenic corpus, and delivered by Apollodoros of Acharnae. <b>The</b> second <b>speech</b> Against Stephanos, preserved as Demosthenes' 46th, {{was certainly not}} composed by Demosthenes, but the authorship of <b>the</b> first <b>speech</b> is disputed. <b>The</b> <b>speeches</b> {{are part of a}} dispute between Apollodoros and his stepfather Phormion.|$|R

5|$|Against Neaera is {{preserved}} as Demosthenes' fifty-ninth speech, {{though it has}} been thought inauthentic since antiquity. Dionysius of Hallicarnassus, for instance, questioned its authorship. Modern scholars from the nineteenth century to the present have generally accepted that <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> was not written by Demosthenes, and today it is often grouped {{with the rest of}} the speeches concerning Apollodoros as being the work of a single Pseudo-Demosthenes. This author has been identified as Apollodoros himself by various scholars, including Kapparis in his commentary on <b>the</b> <b>speech.</b>|$|E
5|$|All five {{versions}} of <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> differ widely {{from one another}} in regard to particulars. All versions, except that in the Gesta Francorum, generally agree that Urban talked about the violence of European society {{and the necessity of}} maintaining the Peace of God; about helping the Greeks, who had asked for assistance; about the crimes being committed against Christians in the east; and about a new kind of war, an armed pilgrimage, and of rewards in heaven, where remission of sins was offered to any who might die in the undertaking. They do not all specifically mention Jerusalem as the ultimate goal. However, {{it has been argued that}} Urban's subsequent preaching reveals that he expected the expedition to reach Jerusalem all along. According to one version of <b>the</b> <b>speech,</b> the enthusiastic crowd responded with cries of Deus vult! ("God wills it!"). However, other {{versions of}} <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> do not include this detail.|$|E

40|$|By {{examining}} <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> of opponents, <b>the</b> work {{attempts to}} investigate what role {{they play in}} the unfolding narrative of Luke’s second volume.   In addition, the thesis attempts to probe Luke’s historiographic horizon by comparing his use of <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> of opponents {{to that of other}} instances in biblical and Second Temple narrative literature. An introductory chapter proposes that the category of the “opponent” or “outsider” is a helpful grid through which to view the manner in which an author builds and strengthens the identity of a community in a historical document. Chapter two reviews research on <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> of Acts from F. C. Baur to the present.   It is observed that the majority of studies on <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> have concentrated on matters of historicity and theology. With the work of Martin Dibelius, it is argued that a fresh avenue of research on <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> was opened, whereby a shift in scholarship slowly began to take place. Rather than focusing exclusively on the historicity of the discourses, scholars began to concentrate on the function of <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> in Acts as a whole {{as well as on the}} historiographic orientation of Acts provided by <b>the</b> <b>speeches.</b> Chapters three to six are exegetical investigations of <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> of opponents in Acts. Chapter seven examines <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> of <b>the</b> opponents of Israel in selected Hebrew and Second Temple Jewish narrative literature. The dissertation draws the following conclusions: Luke used <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> of opponents as one of the channels through which to convey his own ideology.   This literary technique was built upon a theological/historiographical foundation that adhered to the following logic: if God’s control over the history of the Jesus movement was such that even the enemy – unwittingly – was helping in its propagation, then it truly must be a movement sanctioned by God.    The speeches of non-Christians in Acts, therefore, are used as a legitimating factor for its readers.

5|$|Baldwin blocked <b>the</b> <b>speech,</b> {{saying that}} it would shock many people and would be a grave breach of {{constitutional}} principles.
