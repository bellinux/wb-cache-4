5|$|Built by J.W.Walker and Sons, {{the organ}} was {{completed}} {{only two days}} before the opening of the cathedral in 1967. Made {{as an integral part of}} the new cathedral, the architect, Frederick Gibberd, saw the casework as part of his brief and so designed the striking front to the organ. Using decorative woodwork, Gibberd was inspired by the innovative use of the pipes at Coventry Cathedral and the Royal Festival Hall and so arranged <b>the</b> <b>shiny</b> zinc pipes and brass trumpets en chamade to contrast strikingly with concrete pillars which surround the organ.|$|E

There, he {{interrupts}} her lecture on the culture and downfall of Atlantis, and the two return to Sophia's apartment. They discover that Kerner ransacked her office in search of Atlantean artifacts, but Sophia says that she keeps her most valuable item, her necklace, with her. She owns another of <b>the</b> <b>shiny</b> beads, now identified as the mystical metal orichalcum, and places it in the medallion's mouth, invoking the spirit of the Atlantean god Nur-Ab-Sal. She explains that a Nazi scientist called Dr. Hans Ubermann is searching for the power of Atlantis to use it as an energy source for warfare.|$|E

Similar downloads would be available for <b>the</b> <b>shiny</b> Entei (January 17 to 23) and shiny Suicune (January 31 to February 6). All three of these Pokémon still enabled the event for Zoroark in the North American Black and White versions. These three Pokémon were later distributed via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection for European, Australian, and North American markets (for a second time) starting February 7 to 13 with Raikou, again, with subsequent staggered releases for Entei and Suicune throughout February.|$|E

25|$|Reverse swing is a {{phenomenon}} that makes the ball swing {{in the opposite direction}} to that usually produced by the orientation of <b>the</b> <b>shiny</b> and rough sides of the ball. When the ball is reverse swinging, the ball will swing towards <b>the</b> <b>shiny</b> side. Balls that reverse swing move much later and much more sharply than those swinging conventionally, both factors increasing the difficulty the batsman will have in trying to hit the ball. At speeds of over 90mph a ball will always exhibit reverse swing, but as roughness increases on the leading side, the speed at which reverse swing occurs decreases. This means that an older ball {{is more likely to be}} delivered with reverse swing as its surface will have been roughened through use.|$|E
25|$|Lumps of {{red ochre}} found here {{and at other}} Neolithic sites have been {{interpreted}} as evidence that body painting may have been practised.

[...] The scene cuts to Melinda talking to Jim about the plumber still working, and Jim {{says that he has}} not even seen the plumber, but Melinda thinks he had called him. Then she realizes that the plumber is a ghost. When he confesses to this, he takes out Aiden's soldier out of the tub, which was the reason for the plumbing problem. Then at night Aiden is shown talking to Cassidy; then Carl arrives. They talk about <b>the</b> <b>Shinies</b> being children and how <b>the</b> <b>Shinies</b> would win in case of a war breaking out between them and the Shadows.|$|R

Worried about her son's bad deeds, Melvin's mother gives Lapitch a silver coin for luck before they go off. The mouse later gives it to the raccoon, after he falls off Dirty Rat's wagon.|$|E
30|$|Regarding additives, two recipes mention their use: Córdoba (fifteenth century), where {{pomegranate}} peel {{is added}} to the galls extraction, and Madrid (fifteenth to seventeenth centuries), with añil (indigo), refined sugar and alum.

25|$|The rough side tears {{hold the}} air {{more easily than}} <b>the</b> <b>shiny</b> side valleys, so to {{maintain}} the air within the valleys the initial air layer must {{have a very high}} velocity, which is why reverse swing is primarily, but not necessarily, achieved by fast bowlers. Due to the less static nature of the initial air layer it takes longer for the swing to occur, which is why it occurs later in the delivery. This is why conventional and reverse swing can occur in the same delivery.|$|E
25|$|Swing {{balls are}} bowled {{with the same}} grip and {{technique}} as fast balls although the seam is usually angled slightly rather than straight, and the slower ball grip may be used. It is difficult to achieve swing with a cutter grip since the ball will spin in flight, varying the orientation of <b>the</b> <b>shiny</b> and rough surfaces as it moves through the air. Many players, commentators on the game, and fans agree that swing is easier to achieve in humid or overcast conditions, and also that the red ball used in Test cricket swings more than the white ball used in the one-day game.|$|E
25|$|Paintings {{and sculptures}} from the Popeye series, which Koons began in 2002, feature the cartoon figures of Popeye and Olive Oyl. One such item is a {{stainless}} steel reproduction of a mass-market PVC Popeye figurine. The artist will also make use of inflatable animals again, this time in combination with ladders, trashcans and fences. To create these sculptures, the toys get a layer of coating after finding the right shape. Then a hard copy is made {{and sent to the}} foundry to be cast in aluminium. Back in the studio the sculptures are painted in order to achieve <b>the</b> <b>shiny</b> look of the original inflatables. For these surrealist installations, Acrobat in particular, Koons got inspiration from the Chicago Imagist H.C. Westermann.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} mining at Philmont {{dates back to}} the years {{immediately}} after the Civil War. U.S. soldiers were stationed in the West after the war, as the U.S. Army was driving out the American Indians. The story is that one of these soldiers befriended an Indian, who happened to give him a shiny rock. <b>The</b> <b>shiny</b> material in the rock was found to be copper. According to the story, the soldier and two of his friends went up to investigate, and found gold. They could not stay to mine the gold and the area was overrun by miners by the time they returned the next year. Scores of gold mines were excavated in Philmont, and operated into the early 20th century. A large vein of gold is said to lie under Mount Baldy to this day, but extracting it has not been feasible. It is a common joke at Philmont that some day the mines under Baldy will collapse and Phillips will be the highest mountain in Philmont. The Contention Mine, located at Cyphers Mine, and the Aztec Mine, located at French Henry, are open to guided tours.|$|E

She had also told the doctors that if anything happened, then she wanted the child to live even if this caused her death. Melinda listens quietly, then simply hangs up on him without reaction because Delia is knocking on the door in the store, which Melinda had locked.

Aiden comes down and tells Jim, Delia, Ned, and Eli that they have to take him to where Melinda is before something bad happens to her. They go to the store and Aiden knocks on the door. Melinda shows up saying that she is not his mother. Aiden answers that he knows that and that he wants her back. Melinda says, [...] "We're busy." [...] She then goes back into the dark.
