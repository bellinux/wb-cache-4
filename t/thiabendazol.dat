40|$|Com o objetivo de avaliar a eficiência de alguns fungicidas sobre Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, agente etiológico da antracnose do mamoeiro (Carica papaya L.), testes {{in vitro}} foram conduzidos no Laboratório de Epidemiologia/UFLA. Para tanto, utilizou-se o método de incorporação do fungicida ao meio de cultura BDA para avaliação da inibição do crescimento micelial e lâmina escavada contendo água com fungicida para germinação de conídios. Os fungicidas testados foram: azoxystrobin, chlorotalonil, hipoclorito de sódio, imazalil, oxicloreto de cobre, prochloraz, propiconazol, tebuconazol, <b>thiabendazol</b> e tiofanato metílico, nas concentrações de 0, 1, 10, 100, 500 e 1. 000 ppm para avaliar a inibição do crescimento do micélio e 0, 1, 10, 50 e 100 ppm para testar inibição da germinação de conídios. Os fungicidas azoxystrobin, chlorotalonil, imazalil, prochloraz, propiconazol e tebuconazol apresentaram alta eficiência na inibição do crescimento micelial. Os fungicidas dos grupos dos benzimidazóis (<b>thiabendazol</b> e tiofanato metílico) mostraram baixa eficiência e ineficiência, respectivamente, no controle do patógeno, demonstrando uma tolerância do isolado em estudo a estes produtos. O hipoclorito de sódio também apresentou baixa eficiência no controle do crescimento micelial do fungo. Quanto à inibição da germinação dos conídios, os fungicidas que demonstraram maior eficiência em baixas concentrações foram: chlorotalonil e hipoclorito de sódio. The {{efficiency}} of fungicides on Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was evaluated in vitro in the Laboratory of Epidemiology and Diseases Management of the Department of Phytopathology /UFLA. The fungicides were applied either in BDA medium or in glass slide chambers, {{the latter to}} assess the effects on conidial germination. The fungicides tested were: azoxystrobin, chlorothalonil, sodium hypochloride, imazalil, copper oxychloride, prochloraz, propiconazol, tebuconazol, <b>thiabendazol</b> and thiophanate-methyl in the concentrations of 0, 1, 10, 100, 500 and 1. 000 ppm to evaluate the inhibition of the mycelial growth and in the concentrations of 0, 1, 10, 50 and 100 ppm to test inhibition of the conidial germination. The fungicides azoxystrobin, chlorotalonil, imazalil, prochloraz, propiconazol and tebuconazol presented high efficiency in the inhibition of the mycelial growth. The fungicides of the benzimidazol group (<b>thiabendazol</b> and thiophanate-methyl) showed low efficiency in the control of C. gloeosporioides. Sodium hypochloride showed low efficiency in {{the control of the}} mycelial growth of the fungus. For inhibition of the conidial germination, the fungicides oxychloride, chlorothalonil and sodium hypochloride showed high efficiency, even at low concentrations. C. gloeosporioides showed to be tolerant to the fungicides thiabendazole and thiophanate-methyl, as conidial germination and mycelial growth were not affected in the presence of these products...|$|E
40|$|We have {{reported}} {{a case of}} Strongyloides stercolaris complicated with gastric cancer. A 67 -year-old man who had no clinical symptoms and signs of parasitic infection was admitted to Juzenkai Hospital in Nagasaki because of iron-deficient anemia. He had histories of diabetes mellitus, chronic atrial fibrillation and benign prostate hypertrophy. The radiological studies revealed the existence of gastric cancer (Bormann III) and the rhabditiform larvae {{were found in the}} stool after purgation unexpectedly. Subsequently characteristic filariform larvae were detected in the stool by means of filter paper culture technique. We performed the radiological and endoscopic examinations of the alimentary tract, and made a diagnosis of strongyloides infestation by the morphological and immunological (Ouchterlony's method) studies. First of all we tried to exterminate the parasite because the influence of surgical operation in aggravation of infections was a troublesome problem. The treatment with pyrantel pamoate was not effective but a large dose of <b>thiabendazol</b> was very effective to get rid of rhabditiform larvae in the stool. He underwent a gastrojejunostomy with Billroth I methods under the diagnosis of gastric cancer with no evidence of metastasis. After operation, he received the twice of therapy with <b>thiabendazol</b> and the rhabditiform larvae in the stool disappeared completely. We could protect him against the manifestation of the strongyloides infestation. This case suggests that an asymptomatic case of the strongyloides infestation may be existent with or without other disease and we have to examine not only occult blood but also the existence of the parasite in the stool especially before surgical operation of the alimentary tract...|$|E
40|$|Tolerance in {{isolations}} of Trichoderma {{was developed}} by exposing two strains of T. harzianum and three of T. asperelloides to increasing concentrations of chemical fungicides. These isolation of Trichoderma were exposed to three fungicides: Captan, <b>Thiabendazol</b> and the mixture Captan-Carboxin. Some selected lines of these strains reached tolerance to Captan and partial tolerance to the mixture Captan-Carboxin. The biological and genetic changes in these tolerant lines were monitored by determining the relative growth rate of the fungus, inhibition of Fusarium and by analyzing the genomic changes through UP-PCR. The {{results show that the}} tolerance to fungicides can be developed without affecting the parameters of biological activity in these lines of Trichoderma (growth and parasitism against Fusarium). Chemical tolerance to the fungicide was verified by means of changes at the DNA level (UP-PCR), mainly in the lines tolerant to Captan. This suggests that Trichoderma survives in environments with remnants of fungicide molecules...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn H 3 /H 4 histone chaperone, Asf 1, {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in maintaining genomic stability in many species, including fission yeast. Here, we showed that overexpression of a CENP-A chaperone Sim 3 suppressed the temperature sensitive phenotype of asf 1 – 33 and asf 1 – 30 mutants and the defect in chromatin structure, and prevented the accumulation of DNA damage in asf 1 – 33 mutants at high temperatures. Furthermore, asf 1 – 33 and Δsim 3 were synthetic lethal. Consistent with this, shutdown of sim 3 expression in asf 1 – 33 Δsim 3 double mutants that contained extragenic sim 3 resulted in growth retardation. In addition, the Δsim 3 mutant displayed sensitivity to <b>thiabendazol</b> and hydroxyurea, which suggests that Sim 3 plays a general role in maintaining chromatin structure. Our results suggest a possibility that Sim 3 functions as a histone chaperone...|$|E

The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of storage period and mass on the germination of Carabao mango seeds. The fruits were picked and the pits were dried. The seeds were weighed and separated in two classes: I) with a mass up to 19. 0 g, and II) above 19. 0 g. The seeds were treated with 60 % <b>thiabendazol,</b> wrapped in perforated transparent polyethylene bags, maintained in a laboratory, and germinated directly in the plastic bags. The statistical analysis used a randomized block design, with four repetitions, that consisted of five storage periods: 0 (zero), 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. A regression analysis was made. Due to the small number of seeds with a mass less than 19. 0 g, the germination tests using two classes were done only for the periods of zero and the first seven days of storage. It was found that the seeds of Carabao mango, when treated with fungicide, performed best when sown after seven days of storage in polyethylene bags, and that the mass of the seeds positively influenced germination...|$|E

Osbeck), grown under subtropical climatic conditions in Khuzestan, Iran. Each orange cultivar was harvested in optimal {{time and then}} divided into 2 groups for different postharvest treatments. Treatments included heat treatment (hot water dip 52 °C for 3 min and water 25 °C for 3 min), <b>Thiabendazol</b> (TBZ) fungicide (2 g L - 1), without fungicide, wax and combination of these treatments. Consequently, all fruit samples were stored at 6 ± 1 °C and 85 - 90 % humidity (RH) for 3 months. The results showed that, using hot water, wax and TBZ fungicide treatments minimized the postharvest decay especially penicillium molds. Using of these treatments on Siavars cultivar caused to a decay reduction to 2 % as compared to control treatment with 26. 7 % decay. Application of wax significantly ceased to inhibition of fruit weight, ascorbic acid and fruit tissue firmness reduction. Hot water treatment significantly ceased to inhibition of fruit weight and tissue firmness, but a decrease in ascorbic acid content. During cold storage period titratable acidity (TA%) as well as ascorbic acid content significantly decreased.

Malassezia pachydermatis is a yeast recognized as a normal inhabitant on the skin and mucous membranes of dogs and cats. However, it is considered an opportunistic agent that causes external otitis and dermatitis in these animals. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the in vitro effect of thiabendazole against 51 isolates of M. pachydermatis using the CLSI Broth Microdilution method that has been adapted for this yeast species (NCCLS, 2002). Based on this test, the Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) of <b>thiabendazol</b> was calculated. Subsequently, the susceptibility of each isolate against this antifungal was determined.

40|$|In Australia, Sportak® (a. i., prochloraz) {{has been}} {{registered}} {{since the early}} 1980 's for the postharvest control of both anthracnose and stem-end rots in papaya fruit, despite the persistence of fruit breakdown due to disease during transit and at market destinations. Consequently, the Australian papaya industry has been concerned over the efficacy of prochloraz and whether substitute or alternative solutions were available for better disease control, particularly during times of peak disease pressure. This study therefore investigated the effects of various postharvest treatments for disease control in papaya. Fruit were harvested at colour break from coastal farms in Far North Queensland and treated with commercial rates of various fungicides, including prochloraz, imazalil, thiabendazole and fludioxonil. Additional solutions known to inhibit disease were examined, including chitosan and carnauba wax both with and without ammonium carbonate (AC). Following treatment, fruit were ripened and assessed for quality over their shelf life. Fludioxonil when applied as a hot dip {{was found to be}} a more efficacious treatment for control of disease in papaya than prochloraz. The other fungicides were moderately effective, as both <b>thiabendazol</b> and prochloraz exhibited an intermediate response and imazalil was the least effective. Disease severity was lowest in fruit treated with AC followed by chitosan, whilst chitosan delayed degreening. Overall, the study found that hot fludioxonil provided an effective replacement of the currently registered chemical prochloraz, and that alternate solutions such chitosan and AC may also be beneficial, particularly for low chemical input farming systems...|$|E

40|$|A multiclass wide-scope {{screening}} of organic contaminants in natural and waste {{water has been}} developed and validated for qualitative purposes, i. e. detection and reliable identification of compounds detected in samples at {{a certain level of}} concentration. The screening is based on the use of liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry (LC–QTOF MS) and has been applied to water samples of different origin and matrix composition (surface water, ground water and effluent urban wastewater). Water samples were spiked with a standard mixture of around 150 organic contaminants from different chemical families (including a number of relevant metabolites/transformation products (TPs), at 0. 1 and 1 μg/L concentration levels. After solid-phase extraction with Oasis HLB cartridges, sample extracts were analyzed by LC–QTOF MS and the accurate-mass full-spectrum data were processed for qualitative analysis. The presence of at least two ions (typically the (de) protonated molecule and one fragment ion) accurate-mass measured was used for the reliable identification. The screening detection limit (SDL) and the limit of identification (LOI) were established as the main parameters of the screening method. Nearly all compounds could be detected at the lowest concentration tested, but identification was problematic for some compounds at 0. 1 μg/L level, especially in wastewater samples. The screening procedure was finally applied to different water samples using a home-made database of around 1100 organic contaminants. It allowed the detection and identification of several antibiotics, anti-inflammatory/analgesics drugs and lipid regulators. Cocaine and its metabolite benzoylecgonine were also frequently detected.

40|$|The most {{commonly}} cultivated basidiomycetes worldwide and in Serbia are button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus), oyster mushroom (Pleurotus sp.) and shiitake (Lentinus edodes). Production of their fruiting bodies is severely afflicted by fungal, bacterial, and viral pathogens that {{are able to}} cause diseases which affect yield and quality. Major A. bisporus fungal pathogens include Mycogone perniciosa, Lecanicillium fungicola, and Cladobotryum spp., the causal agents of dry bubble, wet bubble, and cobweb disease, respectively. Various Trichoderma species, the causal agents of green mould, also affect all three kinds of edible mushrooms. Over the past two decades, green mould caused by T. aggressivum has been the most serious disease of button mushroom. Oyster mushroom is susceptible to T. pleurotum and shiitake to T. harzianum. The bacterial brawn blotch disease, caused by Pseudomonas tolaasii, is distributed globally. Disease control on mushroom farms worldwide is commonly based on the use of fungicides. However, evolution of pathogen resistance to fungicides after frequent application, and host sensitivity to fungicides are serious problems. Only a few fungicides are officially recommended in mushroom production: chlorothalonil and <b>thiabendazol</b> in North America and prochloraz in the EU and some other countries. Even though decreased sensitivity levels of L. fungicola and Cladobotryum mycophilum to prochloraz have been detected, disease control is still mainly provided by that chemical fungicide. Considering such resistance evolution, harmful impact to the environment and human health, special attention should be focused on biofungicides, both microbiological products based on Bacillus species and various natural substances of biological origin, together with good programs of hygiene.

30|$|In {{the present}} study, dry bean seeds coated with {{thiophanate-methyl}} combined with Trichoderma spp. soil treatment reduced damping-off and root rot/wilt incidence more than using {{any of them}} individually. Data also reveal that Trichoderma spp. were more effective to reduce damping-off and root rot/wilt than thiophanate-methyl. On the other hand, the combination of thiophanate-methyl + T. virens, thiophanate-methyl + T. harzianum, and thiophanate-methyl + T. viride recorded almost the same protection against {{to any of the}} tested fungi. It was suggested that the addition of Trichoderma spp. to the soil before sowing reduced the inoculums of the pathogens and bean seeds coated with thiophanate-methyl protect them from invasion by such pathogens. In the previous study, we found that Trichoderma spp. were highly compatible with thiophanate-methyl in vitro tests (Elshahawya et al. 2016). Also, the combined treatment of Trichoderma spp. and thiophanate-methyl highly reduced the growth of F. solani and F. oxysporum than individual treatment (Elshahawya et al. 2016). Hefnawy et al. (2014) found that T. harzianum and T. koningii combined with low dose of Rizolex T 50 % increased the inhibition percentages of pathogenic fungi and may be beneficial in controlling soil-borne fungi. Bhale and Rajkonda (2015) reported that T. viride, T. harzianum, T. koningii, and T. virens were compatible to fungicides viz., Mancozeb and Captan at lower concentrations. Also, Wedajo (2015) reported that by increasing the fungicide concentrations to 400 [*]ppm (sancozeb) and 600 [*]ppm (curzate), T. harzianum and T. viride tolerate the fungicides 50 % and slightly incompatible at higher concentrations of 800 and 1000 [*]ppm, and completely inhibited beyond 1000 [*]ppm, compared to the control for both fungicides. The obtained results are in agreement with those obtained by many workers. Chaparro et al. (2011) reported that Trichoderma spp. were able to survive in soils with remnants of fungicide molecules such as fungicides of Captan, <b>thiabendazol,</b> and the mixture Captan-Carboxin. Mahmood et al. (2015) reported that thiophanate-methyl combined with Trichoderma spp. gave adequate disease control of bean seedlings and can protecting bean seedling in the field. The use of Trichoderma spp. combined with some commercial fungicides was applied by many workers to obtain additive effects against soil-borne pathogens. Howell et al. (1997) reported that cotton seeds treated with T. virens plus metalaxyl gave seedling stands significantly greater than the untreated seeds as well as seeds treated with fungicide only. Wang et al. (2005) suggested that Trichoderma combined with fludioxonil could be applied into a disease management program for controlling of Fusarium root rot in coneflower. Howell (2007) indicated that Trichoderma spp. plus chloroneb produce the optimum combination treatment for damping-off control of cotton, followed by T. virens plus chloroneb plus metalaxyl. Khalequzzaman (2016) showed that seed treatment with Provax 200 (2.5 [*]g/kg seed), followed by seed treatment with T. harzianum compost (1 : 5) gave the lowest foot and root rot disease incidence of lentil than the untreated control.|$|E
40|$|Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{nematodes}} in the world. Adult worms multiply in the large intestine. Gravid female pinworms migrate to the rectum, where they lay eggs on the skin around the anus. The disease caused by pinworm is called enterobiosis. Small children specially are suffering from this disease. There is no association with world areas or social groups. Enterobiosis is transmitted by faecal-oral route. Eggs are transmitted either through contaminated hands or objects or even dust can contain pinworm eggs. Enterobiosis is usually asymptomatic. However, sometimes there is itching in the anal area, insomnia, discomfort and enuresis and also there could be further complication such as acute appendicitis. Rarely, but in women pinworm can move into the vagina and from there further to uterus or also to the urinary tract. In this case pills Mebendazoland, <b>Thiabendazol</b> are used as a treatment. The goals of this thesis were: 1) To examine representative group of children by Graham method to determine prevalence of enterobiosis. 2) To compare the results with past results which were recorded in the Czech Republic. 3) To compare the results with results published elsewhere. In total 113 children were examined from 3 infant schools. Children were in age between 3 - 7. Nine out of those children were from village and the rest of them were town children. Samples had been collected in the period of time May 2012 - March 2013. Parents of those children gave permission for examination. Samples were taken by Graham method, also called,,Cellophane tape test?? which is simple and cheap. Transparent adhesive tape was applied and pressed to perianal area of the child several times. Afterward the tape has been attached to microscope slide, marked by pertaining number and put into the plastic box before observation. Those samples were observed using the light microscope Olympus CX 21. Objective 10 x has been used to scan the slide and find eggs of Enterobius vermicularis and objective 40 x for confirmation of egg determination. To find eggs of Enterobius vermicularis object-lens 10 x was used. To check positivity when eggs were found I used lens 40 x. Five samples out of 113 samples of examinated children were positive on presence of enterobiosis. The total prevalence was 4, 4 %. Age and sex were considered. Three out of five positive samples came from boys and two from girls. One of the boys was age 4 and two age 6. Girls were of age 4 and 5. The level of significance (P> 5 %) confirmed that there was no difference among children aged depending on the disease. Difference between sexes was not been confirmed. From a previous study was found out that differences between adults and children were not big at all and statistically were not confirmed that adults suffering from enterobiosis is lass than children suffering from this disease. It is hard to confirm that there is no relation between age and spreading this disease because we there are not enough studies on this subject. The cases where adult became ill with enterobiosis were predominately caused by transmission of the infection from children that obtained enterobiosis in the school and then infected family members. Studies focused on occurrence children enterobiosis took place in the Czech Republic in 70 ´s. My results were compared with results from those studies. The prevalence was compared at a time and displayed in a graph. I found out that prevalence decreased 10 - 20 times. From foreign studies the prevalences in European and Asian states were taken and compared with others in the chart. Assumption was, that prevalence in Europe will be lower than in Asia. From my statistics had been demonstrated that the prevalences of this disease is equal in both areas. However the groups of examined were different in each state, which means that results cannot be statistically compared...|$|E
