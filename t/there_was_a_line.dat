25|$|The battle {{ended on}} 24 July 2001 {{after a night}} of fighting. The next day Tetovo was quiet while ethnic Albanian insurgents built up defences with sandbags. Across the {{graveyard}} Macedonian security forces were stationing armoured personnel carriers. After the battle <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> dividing Tetovo with the city stadium being the"border". Although there were individual armed provocations until the end of 2001, the positions held by both sides inside the city of Tetovo, after the battle of 24 July, did not change. The biggest incident after the clashes on 24 July, happened on 7 August when the NLA made another attempt {{to take control of the}} city. The attack failed when the special units of the police launched a counter-strike and forced the insurgents back to their former positions.|$|E
2500|$|Marcia Wallace {{spoke of}} Newhart's amiable nature on set: [...] "He's very low key, and he didn't want to cause trouble. I {{had a dog}} {{by the name of}} Maggie that I used to bring to the set. And {{whenever}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> that Bob didn't like—he didn't want to complain too much—so, he'd go over, get down on his hands and knees, and repeat the line to the dog, which invariably yawned; and he'd say, 'See, I told you it's not funny!'" [...] Wallace has also commented on the show's lack of Emmy recognition: [...] "People think we were nominated for many an Emmy, people presume we won Emmys, all of us, and certainly Bob, and certainly the show. Nope, never!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Also, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> of {{succession}} from Archbishop Makarios III, {{patriarch of the}} Church of Cyprus.|$|R

60|$|Again Crystal was silent. The frown had darkened on her face: <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> {{of bitter}} resentment round her lips--a look of contempt, of hate, {{of a desire}} to hurt, in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|She {{detached}} the stud which {{closed the}} wrist-band of the shirt. On the inner {{side of the}} linen <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> written in red letters--red {{of the color of}} blood. She saw these words: Look in the lining of my trunk.|$|E
60|$|There {{was more}} laughter, a few angry shouts, and a {{movement}} toward the platform. The German signed the paper Mr. Jaswell placed {{before him and}} withdrew. Soon <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> extending from the banker's table to the crowd below, and the signatures for bonds were slowly but steadily secured.|$|E
5000|$|In “The Ballad of Thunder Road” by Robert Mitchum <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> “The {{mountain}} boy took {{roads that}} even angels fear to tread.” ...|$|R

30|$|Determine whether <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> between i and j, i.e., A(i, j) =  0. If so, {{proceed to}} step 5, {{otherwise}} proceed to step 10.|$|R
60|$|He went on reading. Rutherford {{watched him}} with furtive keenness. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> coming {{at the bottom}} of the page which he was then reading which ought to hit him, an epigram on golf, a {{whimsical}} thought put almost exactly as he had put it himself five minutes back when telling his golf story.|$|E
6000|$|... "Copy of the Marriage Register of Welmingham Parish Church. Executed {{under my}} orders, and {{afterwards}} compared, entry by entry, with the original, by myself. (Signed) Robert Wansborough, vestry-clerk." [...] Below this note <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> added, in another handwriting, as follows: [...] "Extending {{from the first}} of January, 1800, to the thirtieth of June, 1815." ...|$|E
6000|$|Without {{a word of}} comment, Amelius put {{a letter}} into his friend's hand. It was his own letter to Regina {{returned}} to him. On the back of it, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> in Mr. Farnaby's handwriting:--"If you send any more letters they will be burnt unopened." [...] In those insolent terms the wretch wrote with bankruptcy and exposure hanging over his head.|$|E

5000|$|On the {{inscription}} and above each {{line of the}} lyrics (transcribed here in polytonic script), <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> with letters and signs for the tune: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>are</b> right, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{certainly}} <b>a</b> break <b>there.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> of surf, but it {{does not}} run up the shore, as it does everywhere else." ...|$|R
60|$|But the Prince had not {{calculated}} that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> of British infantry behind the routed Irish Brigade. Borne {{on with the}} hurry of the melee, flushed with triumph, puffing and blowing with running, and forgetting, in the intoxication of victory, the trifling bayonet-pricks which had impelled them to the charge, the conquering National Guardsmen found themselves suddenly in presence of Jenkins's Foot.|$|E
6000|$|Still {{undecided}} {{what to do}} next, {{her interest}} was excited {{by the appearance of}} one of the servants on the lawn. The woman approached her, and presented a visiting-card; bearing on it the name of Sir Jervis Redwood. Beneath the name, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> written in pencil: [...] "Mrs. Rook, to wait on Miss Emily Brown." [...] The way to the new life was open before her at last! ...|$|E
60|$|The {{sounds of}} hoofbeats grew louder. Gale made out a dark moving mass against a {{background}} of dull gray. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> of horses. He could not discern whether or not all the horses carried riders. The murmur of a voice struck his ear--then a low laugh. It made him tingle, for it sounded American. Eagerly he listened. There was an interval when only the hoofbeats could be heard.|$|E
5000|$|In Nicholas Lanier's [...] "No More Shall Meads be deckt with Flowers", <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>line,</b> [...] "Black Lethe shall {{oblivion}} leave, {{before my}} Celia I deceive...".|$|R

60|$|Mile after mile {{was passed}} as they flew {{like the wind}} over the rolling plains, {{scarcely}} impeded at all by the Pampas grass, which was not long at that season, but at last {{they came to a}} ridge on which <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> of low bushes. By that time, by dint of hard spurring, Lawrence had managed to get up almost alongside of the girl, whose look of gleeful excitement was now changed to one of wild anxiety.|$|E
6000|$|These were {{thoughts}} {{which gave}} {{interest to the}} scene as we passed through the porchway, adorned with petrified stags' horns, into the long entrance hall of the mansion. This porch was copied from one in Linlithgow palace. One side of this hall was lighted by windows of painted glass. The floor was {{of black and white}} marble from the Hebrides. Round the whole cornice <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> of coats armorial, richly blazoned, and the following inscription in old German text: ...|$|E
6000|$|To my unspeakable amazement, {{the writing}} {{certified}} that, [...] "the suspended vital forces in Mrs. Wagner had recovered their action, in the Deadhouse of Frankfort, at half-past one o'clock {{on the morning}} of the fourth of January; that he had professionally superintended the restoration to life; and that he thereby relieved the magistrates from any further necessity for pursuing a private inquiry, the motive for which no longer existed." [...] To this statement <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> added, declaring that Mr. Keller withdrew his application to the magistrates; authenticated by Mr. Keller's signature.|$|E
50|$|The head is purplish-grey, {{occasionally}} {{with a red}} {{patch on}} the nape. It has a moderately short snout. The lips <b>are</b> <b>a</b> strong red colour. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> red <b>line</b> running {{from the corner of}} the mouth toward the tail, and in some specimens <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> of white or yellow colouration running forward from the eye through the nostrils.|$|R

60|$|The aquatic mile-stones of the monikin seas {{have been}} already mentioned; but I believe I omitted to say, that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> of {{demarcation}} drawn in the water, {{by means of}} a similar invention, to point out the limits of the jurisdiction of each state. Thus, all within these water-marks was under the laws of Leaphigh; all between them and those of some other country, was the high seas; and all within those of the other country, Leaplow for instance, was under the exclusive jurisdiction of that other country.|$|E
60|$|Next {{after the}} pages came the embassy itself. First <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> of thirty-six carriages, {{containing}} the principal officers and attendants {{of the three}} embassadors. In one of these carriages, riding quietly with the rest as a subordinate in the train, was Peter. There was doubtless some vague intimation circulating among the crowd that the Emperor of Russia was somewhere in the procession, concealed in his disguise. But there were no means of identifying him, and, of course, whatever curiosity the people felt on the subject remained ungratified.|$|E
60|$|Daylight was now breaking, {{and they}} were able to see that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> of storehouses on the islands {{together}} with a large number of huts. The greater portion of the men were ordered to land, and the fugitives from the ships were hunted down. Most of these had taken refuge in the battery at the mouth of the harbour, but as this was open on the land side it was soon stormed and the defenders all cut down. Then the huts were searched and burnt and the storehouses opened.|$|E
5000|$|An object has reflectional {{symmetry}} (line or mirror symmetry) if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> {{going through}} it which divides it into two pieces which are mirror images of each other.|$|R
