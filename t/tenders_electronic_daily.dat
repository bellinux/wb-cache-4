For instance, the creation of the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU), which advertises public sector contracts from EU local authorities, and the implementation of the <b>Tender</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>Daily</b> (TED) web platform represent an attempt at increasing the level of cooperation and exchange especially among small and medium enterprises (SMEs) across Europe. Similar efforts have been made also in the private sector, where several operations have been moved online, including some significant purchasing functions and procedures. The expansion of so called e-tools (ebidding, e-purchasing and e-procurement) has significantly enlarged the market for European firms, which now are more likely to engage with partners and companies operating outside their regions.

40|$|The thesis tackles {{two major}} {{components}} of modern statehood; {{the creation of}} markets, and public procurement. The context is the European Union’s efforts to create an integrated market for public procurement {{as an effort to}} bind the notion {{of what it means to}} realise the state into a single concept within the European project. The thesis in particular studies the <b>Tenders</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>Daily</b> (TED) that has been a major component of the modern version of the procurement market and constitutes a major effort to control the discursive construction of the act of procurement. The thesis concludes that through market structures there exists the opportunity for perpetuation of ideational hegemony.

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{amount of}} public procurement data is nowadays being ported to linked data format, {{in view of}} its exploitation by government, commercial as well as non-profit subjects. One of the crucial tasks in public procurement is matchmaking demand with supply. We conceived this task as that of finding a supplier with previous successful history of contracts similar to a current call for tenders. In this paper we show how to implement a portable matchmaking service that relies solely on the capability of SPARQL 1. 1. In order to show its effectiveness, the proposed service has been tested and evaluated on the RDFized versions of 2 procurement databases: the European Union's <b>Tenders</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>Daily</b> and the Czech public procurement register. We evaluate several factors influencing matchmaking accuracy, including score aggregation and weighting, query expansion, contribution of additional features obtained from linked data, data quality and volume...|$|E
40|$|Public {{construction}} {{agencies are}} one of the largest developers within the Danish construction industry, where such agencies own and develop new public construction projects. Most of these projects are put out in European tender. This study analyses the selection and assignment criteria employed by these agencies in different types of public sector projects. Some of the objectives pursued by the study include the determination of 1 / the selection and assignment criteria mostly used in Danish public tenders 2 / how different types of projects use selection and assignment criteria in the bidding process, and 3 / any significant difference between the use of selection and assignment criteria in Danish public construction projects. The study uses a quantitative research approach where 157 Danish public tender cases were selected from the European <b>Tenders</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>Daily</b> database between the period: January 2010 to March 2013.

40|$|Public {{procurement}} {{is estimated}} to constitute more than 16 % of GDP in the EU, see e. g. Ramsey (2006). This {{is one of the}} reasons why a lot of interest has been attached to this topic. Most of the papers in this field have been of a theoretical nature but during the last ten years also a few empirical studies have become available, see e. g. Marion, J. (2007) and Bajari et al (2008). At the EU level liberalizations have been going on since the late 80 ’ies (see e. g. the EU commission (1985). Here certain regulations imply that public projects of a certain size need to be subject to a public tender. Again according to Ramsey (2006) around 16 % of all public procurement in the EU is subject to these rules and regulations and information on the contracts corresponding to these 16 % can be found in <b>Tenders</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>Daily</b> (TED) database. In general, the hypothesis is that public procurement will increase competition and ultimately lead to cheaper contracts for the authorities, see e. g. Cecchini (1988) for the economic arguments. But in practice: do the rules and regulations ensure more competition? Do they lead to more internationalization in the sense that more foreign firms become contract winners? Do the government and municipalities in the EU countries actually gain economically from the procurement? Does the choice of type of procedure matter? A lot of interesting questions immediately pops up and some of them – but only some of them - may be analyzed based on the content of this data base. Still, due to the large coverage and the international nature of the data base we believe that a thoroughly study of the possibilities of TED is of major interest and the present study is just a first step in this direction. One of the students who extracted the TED data has also used them for analysis in his master thesis, see Bundsgaard (2010). He has, however, limited his interest to analyze the choice of procedure: auction vs. negotiation and therefore our study has a broader scope when it comes to available variables. To our knowledge we are the first group of researchers who begins to analyze the content of this database using explorative statistical techniques based on a broad range of variables...|$|E
40|$|In December 2007 the Dutch {{government}} {{agreed on}} the action plan Netherlands Open in Connection, hereafter called NOiV, the Dutch acronym. The objectives of this strategic plan are the following: 1. increase interoperability by accelerating the use of open standards; 2. reduction of supplier dependence through a faster introduction of open source software, open standards {{and the use of}} ODF (a document format based on an open standard); 3. promotion of a level playing field in the software market ( [...] .) by forceful stimulation of the use of open source software, and by giving preference to open source software during the process of IT acquisition. To reach these goals the action plan describes a number of different policies for open standards and open source software. A vast number of these policies directly affects the process of IT procurement within government organisations. To understand why some objectives are supported and some are resisted by government buyers, the following researchquestion was selected: How and under what circumstances does a strategic IT plan influence behaviour regarding the practice of public tenders? If these circumstances can be identified it would become possible for policymakers to take them into account while designing future strategic IT policies. To answer the research question a conformance and performance research methodology is used. This methodology focuses bottom-up on the influence a strategic policy has on the behaviour of a targeted organisation during the policy implementation phase. A strategic policy is fulfilling its purpose if it plays a tangible role in the choices of the addressed policy takers. Through monitoring information is produced about the observed policy outcomes (conformance) and through evaluation the research produces information about the value of the observed policy outcomes (performance). To see how the Dutch strategic IT policy is enacted in practice, empirical quantitative research was carried out which asked for the data of all the Dutch calls for tender, published in <b>Tenders</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>Daily</b> (TED) between January and June 2010, that followed the open procedure and that consisted of the delivery of software of some kind. Out of the total sample of 94 calls, data relating to 80 tenders was received, a response rate of 85 %. All these tender documents were examined on different aspects and policies, such as the needs or want for open standards, vendor-independent award criteria, the possibility to use ODF for the bid, and the possible preference for open or closed source products. The goal of this quantitative research is not to generalise the outcome, but to see if during a certain period the policy has been supported or resisted. The collected data from this quantitative research is needed to give input and meaning to the subsequent question whythe strategic policy is resisted or supported. ...|$|E

40|$|Major {{risk factors}} {{relating}} to electronic transactions {{may lead to}} destructive impacts on trust and transparency {{in the process of}} <b>tendering.</b> Currently, <b>electronic</b> <b>tendering</b> (e-tendering) systems still remain uncertain in issues relating to legal and security compliance and most importantly it has an unclear security framework. Particularly, the available systems are lacking in addressing integrity, confidentiality, authentication, and non-repudiation in e-tendering requirements. Thus, one of the challenges in developing an e-tendering system is to ensure the system requirements include the function for secured and trusted environment. Therefore, this paper aims to model a secured e-tendering system using misuse case approach. The modeling process begins with identifying the e-tendering process, which is based on the Australian Standard Code of Tendering (AS 4120 - 1994). It is followed by identifying security threats and their countermeasure. Then, the e-tendering was modelled using misuse case approach. The model can contribute to e-tendering developers and also to other researchers or experts in the e-tendering domain...|$|R
