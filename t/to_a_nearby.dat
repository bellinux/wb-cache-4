Yangwei quickly suffered the same fate. As the Chaoyong attempted to make way <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> island to beach itself, it collided with the Chinese cruiser , before listing to starboard and sinking in shallow water nearby. Some of the crew were rescued by a Chinese torpedo boat engaged in the battle.|$|E
5|$|Bales burned {{some of the}} victims' bodies, an act {{considered}} desecration under Islamic law. Witnesses {{said that}} the eleven corpses from one family were shot in the head, stabbed, then gathered into one room and set on fire. A pile of ashes {{was found on the}} floor of one victims' house; at least one child's body was found partially charred.

5|$|By the 19th century, the {{graveyard}} was full {{and had become}} a public health concern. It was overrun with rats, and dogs chasing the rats, {{both of which were}} damaging the churchyard. Finding sufficient ground for new burials was increasingly difficult and bones were often removed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> charnel house. In 1849, an extra charge was put on burials of people from outside the parish. In 1884, the churchyard was closed to all burials and a cemetery was opened in the town.|$|E

Margot was distraught and took an overdose of strychnine, but survived after Van Gogh rushed her <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> hospital. On 26 March 1885, his father died of a heart attack.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to {{mitigate}} damage by camas pocket gophers to sensitive habitat, the Oregon Department of Transportation and the Institute for Applied Ecology trap and relocate the animals. At a site south of Philomath, Oregon, the IAE is working to protect a small but viable population of Kincaid's lupine (Lupinus sulphureus). This threatened flower is the primary host plant for the endangered Fender's blue butterfly (Icaricia icarioides fenderi), which is endemic to the Willamette Valley. The gophers are relocated <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> location distant from the lupines.|$|E

They moved again a week later to Leck. Around this time, II./JG 1 had moved to airfield at Marienehe and also started taking delivery of the He 162. These new jet aircraft would never see widespread combat with JG 1 due to their late introduction and a shortage of pilots, aircraft and fuel. JG 1 could no longer field their full complement or effectively fly operations as required.|$|E
5|$|On August 11, 1944, the 258 {{men from}} the prison barge were marched <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> sports field and lectured by Admiral Wright who told them that troops {{fighting}} on Saipan desperately needed the ammunition {{they were supposed to}} be loading and that continued refusal to work would be treated as mutinous conduct, which carried the death penalty in times of war. Wright, who had seen nearly 400 of his men killed in 1942 in the Battle of Tassafaronga, said that although loading ammunition was risky, death by firing squad was the greater hazard.|$|E
