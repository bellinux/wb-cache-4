5|$|Like {{many other}} German veterans, Göring was {{a proponent of}} the Stab-in-the-back legend, the belief which held that the German Army had not really lost the war, but instead was betrayed by the {{civilian}} leadership: Marxists, Jews, and especially <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> <b>who</b> had overthrown the German monarchy.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Obama {{administration}} {{passed the}} Affordable Care Act, {{which made the}} most sweeping reforms to the nation's healthcare system in nearly five decades, including mandates, subsidies and insurance exchanges. The law caused {{a significant reduction in}} the number and percentage of people without health insurance, with 24 million covered during 2016, but remains controversial due to its impact on healthcare costs, insurance premiums, and economic performance. Although the recession reached its trough in June 2009, voters remained frustrated with the slow pace of the economic recovery. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans,</b> <b>who</b> stood in opposition to Obama's policies, won control of the House of Representatives with a landslide in 2010 and control of the Senate in 2014.|$|E
5|$|She, {{along with}} the {{remaining}} members of the Imperial Family, was sent into exile after a coup d'état staged by a clique of army officers in 1889. Being cast from her beloved adopted land had a devastating effect on Teresa Cristina's spirit and health. Grieving and ill, she died of respiratory failure leading to cardiac arrest {{little more than a}} month after the monarchy's collapse. She was greatly loved by her subjects, both during her lifetime and afterwards. She was even respected by <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>who</b> overthrew the Empire. Despite having had no direct impact on Brazil's political history, Teresa Cristina is well regarded by historians not only for her character and irreproachable behavior, but also for her sponsorship of Brazilian culture.|$|E

5|$|During Grant's {{presidency}} {{the early}} Women's suffrage movement led by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton gained national attention. Anthony lobbied for female suffrage, equal gender pay, {{and protection of}} property for women who resided in Washington D.C. In April 1869, Grant signed into law the protection of married women's property from their husbands' debts and the ability for women to sue in court in Washington D.C. In March 1870 Representative Samuel M. Arnell introduced a bill, coauthored by suffragist Bennette Lockwood, that would give women federal workers equal pay for equal work. Two years later Grant signed a modified Senate version of the Arnell Bill into law. The law required that all federal female clerks would be paid the fully compensated salary, however, lower tiered female clerks were exempted. The law increased women's clerk salaries from 4% to 20% during the 1870s, however, the culture of patronage and patriarchy continued. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans,</b> <b>who</b> needed women to campaign for Grant in the 1872 Presidential Election, added to their platform open discussion of women's rights.|$|E

25|$|Cooper {{was elected}} to the Third Protectorate Parliament in early 1659 as member for Wiltshire. During the debates in this parliament, Cooper sided with <b>the</b> <b>republicans</b> <b>who</b> opposed the Humble Petition and Advice and insisted that the bill {{recognising}} Richard Cromwell as Protector should limit his control over the militia and eliminate the protector's ability to veto legislation. Cooper again spoke out against the Other House (consisting of new lords), and in favour of restoring the old House of Lords.|$|E
25|$|In 1823, {{during the}} First Costa Rican Civil War, Costa Rica {{was divided into}} two groups: the Imperialists, who were loyal to the First Mexican Empire, and <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> <b>who</b> wanted independence. For the most part, Alajuela and San José fought against the coup staged by the Republicans in Heredia and Cartago. The Alajuelan side won, and Costa Rica left the Mexican Empire shortly before it dissolved. While Costa Rica {{was a member of}} the Federal Republic of Central America in the 1830s, the city of Alajuela was the nation's capital.|$|E
25|$|Nehru closely {{worked with}} Subhas Chandra Bose in {{developing}} {{good relations with}} governments of free countries all over the world. However, the two split in the late 1930s, when Bose agreed to seek the help of fascists in driving the British out of India. At the same time, Nehru had supported <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>who</b> were fighting against Francisco Franco's forces in the Spanish Civil War. Nehru along with his aide V. K.

25|$|On 31 July 1817 Morillo {{launched}} the assault, which began at eight thirty in the morning. The struggle was fierce, with the Spanish pressing {{hard against the}} defensive front. In his later report on the battle, Morillo paid tribute to the stubborn courage of <b>the</b> <b>republicans,</b> <b>who</b> repelled repeated cavalry charges. During {{the course of the}} fighting, many unarmed men and women from the town joined the defenders, taking up the arms of those who had been killed or wounded. General Esteban Gómez himself was hit by bullets several times, and his horse was killed under him.|$|E
25|$|Throughout 1938 the {{principal}} if not exclusive source of new men was a draft; {{at this stage}} it was <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>who</b> conscripted more aggressively. In {{the middle of the}} year, just prior to the Battle of Ebro, the Republicans achieved their all-time high, commanding an army of slightly above 800,000; this was already no match for the Nationalists, who numbered 880,000. The Battle of Ebro, fall of Catalonia and collapsing discipline produced a massive shrinking of the Republican troops. In late February 1939 their army was 400,000 compared to more than double that number of Nationalists. In the moment of their final victory, the latter commanded over 900,000 troops.|$|E
25|$|With his ranks swelled by Italian {{troops and}} Spanish colonial {{soldiers}} from Morocco, Franco made {{another attempt to}} capture Madrid in January and February 1937, but was again unsuccessful. The Battle of Málaga started in mid-January, and this Nationalist offensive in Spain's southeast would turn into a disaster for <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> <b>who</b> were poorly organised and armed. The city was taken by Franco on 8 February. The consolidation of various militias into the Republican Army had started in December 1936. The main Nationalist advance to cross the Jarama and cut the supply to Madrid by the Valencia road, termed the Battle of Jarama, led to heavy casualties (6,000–20,000) on both sides. The operation's main objective was not met, though Nationalists gained a modest amount of territory.|$|E

Carlucci prevailed in the general election.|$|R
5000|$|Thus, {{until the}} turn of the 20th century, the {{dominant}} forces of the French Left were composed of <b>the</b> Opportunist <b>Republicans,</b> <b>who</b> considered that <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> regime could only be consolidated by successive phases.

25|$|The {{cultural}} history throughout Brazil {{is relevant to}} the changing theories of art's purpose and the consequential role that Modernist artists played. There were not many art institutions in Brazil and the country lacked a long theory of art technique that was institutional in other countries such as France with the Academie Royale de Peinture et Sculpture. By {{the end of the}} nineteenth century there was dissent in Rio's National School of Fine Arts and it was threatened to be closed by <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>who</b> wanted all people who desired to become artists would have the ability to do so. This stemmed somewhat of a revolution where society became more receptive to new ideas by 1890. However, people who were too tied to the emperor were left from the artistic and cultural spectrum. By the 1920s there was a desire for a more specified and formal reconsideration of the arts and São Paulo was especially prominent in this area. However, along with the desire for renovation came the equally strong loyalty to a realistic portrayal of Brazilian life and culture.|$|E
25|$|The popular historiography of the War in the Vendée {{is deeply}} rooted in {{conflicts}} between different schools of French historiography, and, as a result, writings on the uprising are generally highly partisan, coming down strongly {{in support of the}} revolutionary government or the Vendéen royalists. This conflict originated in the 19th century between two groups of historians, the Bleus, named for their support of <b>the</b> <b>republicans,</b> <b>who</b> based their findings on archives from the uprising and the Blancs, named for their support of the monarchy and the Catholic Church, who based their findings on local oral histories. The Bleus generally argued that the Vendée was not a popular uprising, but was the result of noble and clerical manipulation of the peasantry. One of the leaders of this school of thought, Charles-Louis Chassin, published eleven volumes of letters, archives, and other materials supporting this position. The Blancs, generally members of the former nobility and clergy themselves, argued (frequently using the same documents as Chassin, but also drawing from contemporary memoirs and oral histories) that the peasants were acting out of a genuine love for the nobility and a desire to protect the Catholic Church.|$|E

[...] Henry L. Stimson, Secretary of War under President Taft and Secretary of State under Hoover, was restored to the War position, and Landon's 1936 running mate, Frank Knox, was appointed Navy Secretary.

500|$|In 1855 the {{national}} Know Nothing convention {{split on the}} subject of slavery. [...] Prominent antislavery Know Nothing supporters in Massachusetts, including Henry Wilson, began another attempt (after having failed in 1854) to form a party with abolition as a major focus. [...] This effort resulted {{in the formation of the}} Republican Party, which sought to negotiate with the Know Nothings for a fusion of the two parties. [...] However, Massachusetts Know Nothing leadership refused fusion and Republican leadership refused coalition, with many Republicans skeptical of Gardner's fidelity to the antislavery cause despite his support for fusion. [...] The parties ended up fielding separate slates of candidates, and many Know Nothing politicians and supporters switched allegiance. [...] In the fall election Gardner, running on a strictly nativist platform, garnered 38% of the vote, to the 27% of Republican Julius Rockwell. [...] With the new plurality voting rule in effect, Gardner won the election, but the split (and disaffection in some circles with the Know Nothing agenda) cost him support from former Free Soilers and Democrats. [...] In the 1856 election Gardner benefited from a deal with <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> <b>who</b> refused to run a candidate for governor in exchange for Know Nothing support for their presidential candidate, John C. Frémont. [...] He easily won reelection, although many Republicans voted for a protest candidate instead of supporting him. [...] He attempted to parlay the Republican support into an election to the United States Senate (a matter then decided by the state senate early in its session) replacing Charles Sumner. [...] However, Republican operatives maneuvered the Senate into voting before Gardner's speech opening the 1857 session, and Sumner was easily reelected.|$|E
