5|$|In his 1931 autobiography, <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> pioneer Harry Reichenbach claimed {{responsibility}} for the controversy surrounding September Morn– and the work's resulting popularity. He stated that Braun and Company had acquired some 2,000 reproductions of the painting which they could not sell, and then hired him for $45 so that he could unload the stock. They then paid for a large lithograph reproduction to be made and put on display. Reichenbach, he stated, then contacted public figures to protest against the display. When there was no response, he accosted Comstock in his office and dragged him to the dealership, where some young children, whom Reichenbach had hired for fifty cents each, lusted over the display. <b>The</b> <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> man then worked towards maintaining interest in the work, prints of which had already increased in price– from 10 cents to a dollar.|$|E

Although he and LeMay were friends, LeMay had been Hansell’s subordinate in England, and Hansell declined the offer. While all the command problems factored into his relief, the main reasons were Hansell’s persistence in daylight precision attacks, reluctance to night firebombing, Norstad's view that Hansell was an impediment to instituting incendiary attacks, and a perception by Arnold and Norstad that <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> effort by XXI Bomber Command had been unsatisfactory in preparing the American public for such attacks.|$|E

Bradman advised Lindwall to ensure that his dragging rear right foot was further behind the line than usual to avoid being no-balled, and to refrain from bowling at full speed until the umpires were satisfied with his delivery stride. The Australian captain guaranteed Lindwall selection for the Tests and told him that his first priority in the lead-in tour matches was passing the umpires' scrutiny. Bradman recalled how paceman Ernie McCormick had been no-balled 35 times in the traditional tour opener against Worcester during the 1938 campaign, destroying his confidence {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, she {{returned}} to India {{in the wake of}} the economic recession and moved to Mumbai to stay with Priyanka. During a visit to Yash Raj Films studio, Priyanka (who was filming for Pyaar Impossible!) introduced Parineeti to the head of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> team of the company. Chopra obtained an internship in the marketing department, joining the production company as a public-relations consultant. She considered it a perfect job, because she could use what she had learned and work in films. Chopra had disliked actors and acting; to her, the profession seemed like an excuse to wear too much makeup. This changed when she observed Priyanka's preparations for her role in 7 Khoon Maaf (2011), which highly influenced her and changed her perception towards acting and actors. Once she learnt more about filmmaking, her respect for the profession increased.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MTech (<b>Public</b> <b>Relations</b> Management)) [...] Cape Technikon, 2004 <b>The</b> role of <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> as a {{management}} function is currently under discussion among <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> practitioners in South Africa. PRISA - <b>the</b> Institute for <b>Public</b> <b>Relations</b> and Communication Management (Southern Africa) has also immersed itself {{in this discussion}} and is actively involved {{in a number of}} activities aiming at repositioning <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> as a strategic management function. This discussion is the latest development in a discourse on <b>the</b> role of <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> spanning a number of decades, and is a logical outcome of an evolution of the understanding of <b>the</b> contribution that <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> makes to <b>the</b> success of organisations. The discussion, however, has several dimensions - <b>the</b> role of <b>pUblic</b> <b>relations</b> in regard to marketing; <b>the</b> contribution that <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> makes to integrated marketing communication; and <b>the</b> role of <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> as {{a management}} function on the top level of the organisation. Clarity about, and an understanding of, <b>the</b> role of <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> in <b>the</b> organisation is therefore crucial to the practical implementation of "new" thinking on <b>public</b> <b>relations.</b> Literature - especially in <b>the</b> sphere of <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> - seeks to give theoretical manifestation to a relatively young discipline seeking to carve its own niche in the organisational sphere of operation. While a number of authors agree on the valuable contribution that <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> can make to the organisation's strategic success, some measure of confusion seems to exist regarding the precise relationship between <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> and other functional departments within the organisation, most notably marketing and marketing communication...|$|R

In addition to overseeing the innovative event itself, Goodman's public relations service did yeoman work to ensure extensive news media coverage.

Sixty-four news releases were issued and <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> service assisted {{in the making of}} 11newsreels and 53magazine articles. The three major U.S. radio networks of the time, NBC, CBS and Mutual, all set up complete broadcasting studios near the jamboree headquarters to produce almost 19hours of live, on-site jamboree coverage broadcast coast-to-coast. Celebrities also visited the jamboree, including well-known broadcaster Lowell Thomas and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. While at the jamboree, Scouts also attended a three-game baseball series between the Washington Senators and the Boston Red Sox at Griffith Stadium, with Goodman arranging for Eagle Scouts to have a place of honor with President Roosevelt in the stands (pictured).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Relations</b> Society of America and the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication {{commissioned}} {{studies in}} 1975 and 1987 {{on the state}} of public relations in education. They found that too many classes were taught by educators with little or no experience in the field and that most didn't have a post-graduate degree. Several standards in education were established by the studies, including that 75 percent of coursework for PR professionals be outside the major. In 1991, PRSA hosted a Task Force on the Structure and Role on Public Relations, which found that public relations teachers still lacked practical experience. In 1993 PRSA published a Professional Career Guide, which classified skills and knowledge that were needed at five different levels of someone's career. PRSA also advocates that MBA programs include communications programs, so business executives will be more prepared for a crisis.|$|E
5|$|Today, the MLB commissioner's office {{directly}} {{employs the}} official scorers {{who are responsible}} for producing score reports, but most scorers are hired on the recommendation of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> directors of baseball teams. Official scorers are typically retired writers, coaches, and umpires. Unlike umpiring teams, MLB official scorers do not typically travel between stadiums. Each official scorer is assigned to a stadium for the season, with each stadium having one or more scorers. Scorers now have access to replay video from different angles which they can review before making a decision. As of 2012, MLB official scorers earned $150 per game. Official scorers are not required to meet the old BBWAA requirements, and are also no longer required to pass a written test, which was once administered by the National League before it was phased out in the mid-1990s. Potential scorers are generally required to briefly apprentice under an existing scorer before they are allowed to work alone.|$|E
