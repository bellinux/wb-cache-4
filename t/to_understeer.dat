5|$|At low forward speeds, the {{precession}} of {{the front}} wheel is too quick, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to oversteer, start to lean {{the other way and}} eventually oscillate and fall over. At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency <b>to</b> <b>understeer</b> and eventually fall over without ever having reached the upright position. This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is easy for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, Holden's then {{managing}} director, an American named George Roberts, {{insisted that}} the HQ Holdens should [...] "ride like a Cadillac" [...] and that the front suspension be engineered to make the car prone <b>to</b> <b>understeer</b> for [...] "safety reasons". Advertising of the car promoted its [...] "jet-smooth ride" [...] over rough roads. Notwithstanding persistent criticism from many motoring journalists, this policy persisted with the subsequent HJ and HX facelift models. It was arguable whether Australian buyers favoured this engineering philosophy {{and it was not}} until the 1977 HZ facelift that radical changes were made to the suspension to improve handling.|$|E
50|$|Evidently {{moving the}} centre of gravity {{forwards}} increases this speed, giving the vehicle a tendency <b>to</b> <b>understeer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Vehicles are {{inherently}} nonlinear systems, {{and it is}} normal for K to vary over the range of testing. It is possible for a vehicle <b>to</b> be <b>understeer</b> in some conditions and oversteer in others. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} specify the speed and lateral acceleration whenever reporting understeer/oversteer characteristics.|$|R
50|$|Several {{tests can}} be used <b>to</b> {{determine}} <b>understeer</b> gradient: constant radius (repeat tests at different speeds), constant speed (repeat tests with different steering angles), or constant steer (repeat tests at different speeds). Formal descriptions of these three kinds of testing are provided by ISO. Gillespie goes into some detail {{on two of the}} measurement methods.|$|R
5000|$|MP4-12C shares {{its name}} with the MP4/12 Formula 1 car that raced in the 1997 season. This car {{featured}} a second brake pedal discovered by photographers <b>to</b> counter <b>understeer</b> on the exit {{of the corners}} by selecting the inside rear wheel, similar to the computer controlled [...] "brake steer" [...] system of the MP4-12C.|$|R
5000|$|Front-engine {{front-wheel-drive}} layouts are [...] "nose heavy" [...] {{with more}} weight distribution forward, {{which makes them}} prone <b>to</b> <b>understeer,</b> especially in high horsepower applications.|$|E
50|$|Under hard acceleration, the {{decreased}} weight {{over the}} front wheels means less traction, sometimes producing a tendency for rear-engined cars <b>to</b> <b>understeer</b> out of a corner.|$|E
50|$|Note: Installing a heavy, {{powerful}} {{engine in}} a light weight production vehicle designed around a small engine increases both its directional stability, and its tendency <b>to</b> <b>understeer.</b> The result is an overpowered vehicle with poor cornering performance.|$|E
5000|$|When {{cornering}} under acceleration on {{a slippery}} surface, the rear axle is engaged with delay, causing sudden {{change in the}} car's behaviour (from <b>understeer</b> <b>to</b> oversteer).|$|R
50|$|Standard {{terminology}} used <b>to</b> describe <b>understeer</b> and oversteer {{are defined by}} the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) in document J670 and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in document 8855. By these terms, understeer and oversteer are based on differences in steady-state conditions where the vehicle is following a constant-radius path at a constant speed with a constant steering wheel angle, on a flat and level surface.|$|R
5000|$|The MP4-12C {{features}} a carbon fibre composite chassis, and {{is powered by}} a mid-mounted McLaren M838T 3.8-litre V8, twin-turbo engine developing approximately [...] and around 443 lbft Nm of torque. The car makes use of Formula 1-sourced technologies such as [...] "brake steer", where the inside rear wheel is braked during fast cornering <b>to</b> reduce <b>understeer.</b> Power is transmitted to the wheels through a seven-speed seamless shift dual-clutch gearbox.|$|R
5000|$|Predictable {{handling}} characteristics: front-wheel-drive cars, with a {{front weight}} bias, tend <b>to</b> <b>understeer</b> at the limit, which (according to SAAB engineer Gunnar Larsson) is easier since it makes instinct correct in avoiding terminal oversteer, and {{less prone to}} result in fishtailing or a spin.|$|E
5000|$|The RS 5 weighs 1800 kg, with 56.3 {{percent at}} the front and 43.7 in the rear which makes it prone <b>to</b> <b>understeer,</b> however Audi has added two {{electro-mechanical}} systems to counter its nose-heaviness. The stability-control system attempts to stop front-end plow before it happens by squeezing the brakes on the inside wheels which effectively drag those tires enough to pull the car into the corner.|$|E
50|$|In {{steady-state}} cornering, front-heavy cars tend <b>to</b> <b>understeer</b> and rear-heavy cars {{to oversteer}} (Understeer & Oversteer explained), {{all other things}} being equal. The mid-engine design seeks to achieve the ideal center of mass, though front-engine design {{has the advantage of}} permitting a more practical engine-passenger-baggage layout. All other parameters being equal, at the hands of an expert driver a neutrally balanced mid-engine car can corner faster, but a FR (front-engined, rear-wheel drive) layout car is easier to drive at the limit.|$|E
5000|$|Electronic {{stability}} control (ESC) is {{a computerized}} technology that improves {{the safety of}} a vehicle's stability by attempting to detect and prevent skids. When ESC detects loss of steering control, the system applies individual brakes to help [...] "steer" [...] the vehicle where the driver wants to go. Braking is automatically applied to individual wheels, such as the outer front wheel to counter oversteer, or the inner rear wheel <b>to</b> counter <b>understeer.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{start of}} the race saw Michael Schumacher {{immediately}} cut Montoya, making the Colombian brake and avoid a collision, this allowed Barrichello to get alongside Montoya coming into the first corner. Montoya however managed to out-brake the Brazilian into the first corner and thus was alongside Schumacher going through the corner. As the Williams and Ferrari travelled through the corner, Schumacher's Ferrari started <b>to</b> experience <b>understeer</b> and went into Montoya's car, taking the Ferrari front wing off. The incident left Montoya going wide and going off the track for a brief moment.|$|R
5000|$|During the season, F1 Racing {{photographer}} Darren Heath {{noticed that}} the rear brakes of the McLarens were glowing red in an acceleration zone of the track. The magazine discovered through photos of {{the inside of the}} cockpit, that McLaren had installed a second brake pedal, selectable by the driver to act on one of the rear wheels. This allowed the driver <b>to</b> eliminate <b>understeer</b> and reduce wheelspin when exiting slow corners, dubbed [...] "brake steer". Ferrari's protestations to the FIA led to the system being banned the following season at the 1998 Brazilian Grand Prix.|$|R

5000|$|Although the {{architecture}} of the suspension remained as before, numerous detailed modifications were made to counter criticism of the old model. Changes included an anti-roll bar as standard equipment on all but the entry-level models, and stiffer springs at the back, intended to compensate for the Victor's tendency <b>to</b> <b>understeer.</b> At the front the springing remained soft {{by the standards of the}} time: the track was widened (by 1.7 inches / 4 cm) and wheel geometry modified to incorporate [...] "anti-dive action", improvements intended to address the Victor's tendency to wallow, which by then was attracting criticism from performance-oriented commentators.|$|E
50|$|Automotive {{magazine}} Road & Track {{reviewed the}} GT in their June 1969 issue, recording 0-96 km/h in 10.8 seconds {{and a top}} speed of 182 km/h. Road & Track also found the car <b>to</b> have strong <b>understeer,</b> suggesting the 165x13 tires to be too small, although the ride was comfortable.|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{the vehicle}} had power {{steering}} and a semi-automatic transmission (the transmission required no clutch pedal, but gears {{still had to}} be shifted by hand), though the shift lever controlled a powered hydraulic shift mechanism {{in place of a}} mechanical linkage, and a fibreglass roof which lowered the centre of gravity and so reduced weight transfer. Inboard front brakes (as well as independent suspension) reduced unsprung weight. Different front and rear track widths and tyre sizes reduced the unequal tyre loading, which is well known <b>to</b> promote <b>understeer,</b> typical of front-engined and front-wheel drive cars.|$|R
5000|$|This {{arrangement}} {{gave the}} car about [...] {{and a top}} speed of 196 km/h (achieved at Såtenäs airfield). This was a speed record but was not recognised on account of discrepancies in scrutineering and recording. The low weight and the 'drop' or aerofoil shape of the body gave the rear end a tendency to become airborne when approaching the top speed. The amount of torque, coupled with front-wheel drive, also gave rise <b>to</b> severe <b>understeer.</b> It was the combination of immense power and poor handling that gave rise to the name 'Monster'. The project was terminated because it proved impractical.|$|R
50|$|Most cars {{today are}} FWD and are prone <b>to</b> <b>understeer.</b> This makes a vehicle stable {{at high speed}} but {{requires}} larger steering inputs near the limits of adhesion, especially on low-grip surfaces. Skilled drivers are able to allow for understeer by using a maneuver similar to the Scandinavian flick, though with less steering input and control the possible slide by using opposite lock. In the best of cases, the driver would use the inertia of the feint to make the car enter the bend without initiating a slide. This requires excellent knowledge of the specific car. However, less skilled drivers must not attempt to use this technique, as it can prove very dangerous.|$|E
50|$|The {{season will}} be best remembered for the two-car {{accident}} between Masato Kawabata and Daigo Saito in Fuji Speedway, when during the sudden death second tsuiou round, Saito dipped into the inner apex of the 300R corner, causing his car <b>to</b> <b>understeer</b> and collecting Kawabata's Silvia onto the tyre barrier in the process, severely destroyed both cars. Kawabata had a second luck escape as when he collided with the barrier, a nitrous tank housed {{on the passenger side}} of his vehicle exploded from the impact, but played no part in Kawabata's injury.Among those narrowly escaping death was Video Option cameraman, Zaku, had to duck to avoid debris from the crash. Both drivers survived without serious injuries, but however Kawabata had to be taken to hospital for treatment for whiplash injuries.|$|E
5000|$|They feature {{air-conditioning}} and a wrap-around {{seating arrangement}} at the rear. They {{are designed to}} mimic trams in their appearance and in the UK, the Wright StreetCar buses are used on First Group's ftr services since its launch in May 2006, with high frequencies and dedicated stops to further enforce {{the impression of a}} premium service. They have also gained the nickname of [...] "understeer streetcar" [...] with some drivers because of a tendency <b>to</b> <b>understeer</b> negotiating roundabouts.In 2006, Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada in the United States placed an order for 50 StreetCar Rapid Transit Vehicles for delivery in late 2000s. Developed from the Wright StreetCar, these will be hybrid-powered vehicles with chassis built by Carrosserie Hess of Switzerland. On 24 December 2008, RTC StreetCar A016 arrived, appropriately on Christmas Eve.|$|E
5000|$|At the 1997 Austrian Grand Prix, Darren Heath, an F1 Racing photographer, {{noticed that}} the rear brakes of the McLarens were glowing red in an {{acceleration}} zone of the track. The magazine discovered through investigation that McLaren had installed a second brake pedal, selectable by the driver to act on {{any one of the}} rear wheels at the driver's control. This allowed the driver <b>to</b> eliminate <b>understeer</b> and reduce wheelspin when exiting slow corners. This system was entirely legal, but was an innovation, and hence gave McLaren an advantage. While F1 Racing suspected what McLaren were doing, they required proof to publish the story.|$|R
50|$|Other {{features}} included VDC (Vehicle Dynamic Control) or Alfa's {{version of}} ESP (Electronic Stability Program), ASR (Anti Slip Regulation) or traction control, EBD (Electronic Brake Distribution), ABS, brake assist {{and later the}} Q2 System. The Q2 system is Alfa's limited-slip differential technology, for improved cornering, reducing wheel spin, and torque steer <b>to</b> help mitigate <b>understeer</b> common <b>to</b> front-wheel drive cars.|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} control {{potential in}} all-wheel drive vehicles enables the vehicle <b>to</b> maintain <b>understeer</b> characteristics from the linear tire range {{up to the}} grip limit. This provides consistent feedback to the driver over {{a wider range of}} operating conditions than for two-wheel drive vehicles. In order to aid the development of current and emerging driveline systems, the authors see a need for improved theory and methods (numerical and graphical) describing the influence of drive force distribution on these said factors. In this work the methods for computing the lateral grip margin for a general drive force distribution are developed for four special cases; front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive, rigid all-wheel drive; and finally, an optimal front/rear drive force distribution...|$|R
50|$|In , at round 2, held in Fuji Speedway, {{during a}} sudden death round against Daigo Saito, Saito dipped {{into the inner}} apex of the 300R corner and jumped the curb of the track, causing his front wheels to lose traction, which {{resulted}} Saito's car <b>to</b> <b>understeer</b> and collecting Kawabata's Silvia onto the tyre barrier in the process, severely destroyed both cars. The impact between the cars {{and when they were}} hurled into the track protection barrier happened at speeds of over 150 km/h. Kawabata had to be taken to hospital for treatment for whiplash injuries, Saito miraculously evaded any physical damages. Kawabata won the round which he was unable to continue, leaving Atsushi Kuroi without an opponent. For the following round, he returned with a new car and took the win at the next round at Sportsland SUGO.|$|E
50|$|The ratios {{between the}} slip angles {{of the front}} and rear axles (a {{function}} of the slip angles of {{the front and rear}} tires respectively) will determine the vehicle's behavior in a given turn. If the ratio of front to rear slip angles is greater than 1:1, the vehicle will tend <b>to</b> <b>understeer,</b> while a ratio of less than 1:1 will produce oversteer. Actual instantaneous slip angles depend on many factors, including the condition of the road surface, but a vehicle's suspension can be designed to promote specific dynamic characteristics. A principal means of adjusting developed slip angles is to alter the relative roll couple (the rate at which weight transfers from the inside to the outside wheel in a turn) front to rear by varying the relative amount of front and rear lateral load transfer. This can be achieved by modifying the height of the roll centers, or by adjusting roll stiffness, either through suspension changes or the addition of an anti-roll bar.|$|E
5000|$|EBD {{may work}} in {{conjunction}} with ABS and Electronic Stability Control (ESC) to minimize yaw accelerations during turns. ESC compares the steering wheel angle to vehicle turning rate using a yaw rate sensor. [...] "Yaw" [...] is the vehicle's rotation around its vertical center of gravity (turning left or right). If the yaw sensor detects more/less yaw than the steering wheel angle should create, the car is understeering or oversteering and ESC activates one of the front or rear brakes to rotate the car back onto its intended course. For example, if a car is making a left turn and begins <b>to</b> <b>understeer</b> (the car plows forward {{to the outside of}} the turn) ESC activates the left rear brake, which will help turn the car left. The sensors are so sensitive, and the actuation is so quick that the system may correct direction before the driver reacts. ABS helps prevent wheel lock-up and EBD helps apply appropriate brake force to make ESC work effectively and easily.|$|E
50|$|Significant {{advances}} {{were made}} with the rear suspension. The previous large Taunus had featured a rigid rear axle, suspended using traditional leaf-springs, but with the TC Ford used a rear suspension configuration involving coil springs, with the axle located using two longitudinal and two lateral linkages. The front wheels, no longer driven, were suspended with a conventional wishbone suspension, which eschewed shock absorbers and gave the car a soft 'freeway' ride and, with the heavier 6-cylinder engines, a tendency <b>to</b> excessive <b>understeer.</b> Press criticism of the trade-off between the car's road-holding and ride-comfort soon evolved into a more general critique, not convincingly addressed by the manufacturer for several years, that Ford had launched the Taunus TC before they had finished developing it.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A rigid-elastic {{coupling}} multi-body {{dynamic model}} of a car was established. The controllability and stability including constant cornering, steering returnability and steering effort performances are analyzed. Results {{show that there is}} still a feasibility <b>to</b> enhance the <b>understeer.</b> By optimizing the suspension parameters using DOE method, the characteristic of understeer was improved. Simulation analysis indicated that the characteristics of steering effort and steering returnability were not affected due to change of suspension parameters...|$|R
2500|$|Electronic {{stability}} control (ESC), {{also referred}} to as electronic stability program (ESP) or dynamic stability control (DSC), is a computerized technology that improves a vehicle's stability by detecting and reducing loss of traction (skidding). When ESC detects loss of steering control, it automatically applies the brakes to help [...] "steer" [...] the vehicle where the driver intends to go. Braking is automatically applied to wheels individually, such as the outer front wheel to counter oversteer or the inner rear wheel <b>to</b> counter <b>understeer.</b> Some ESC systems also reduce engine power until control is regained. ESC does not improve a vehicle's cornering performance; instead, it helps to minimize the loss of control. [...] According to Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, one-third of fatal accidents could be prevented by the use of the technology.|$|R
