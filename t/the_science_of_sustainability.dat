40|$|Abstract (Human {{durability}} and chemical education) Two {{hundred years of}} intense economical growth, centrally driven by abundant access to sources of inexpensive energy have allowed {{the establishment of a}} social paradigm that has directed the development of all social, economic, educational, scientific and technological aspects of our society However, during the past fifty years, evidence has accumulated of our displacement towards several planetary boundaries {{as a result of the}} effects of the application of this paradigm, thus alerting us of the impossibility of its continuance. Sustainability science is a rational attempt of adopting an alternative paradigm that allows to deviate from these planetary boundaries. The relative autonomy of universities and its influence on the creation of cultural capital make them a forceful participant in the diffusion and application of <b>the</b> <b>science</b> <b>of</b> <b>sustainability.</b> Chemistry has an important role in solving some of the most urgent problems of our present situation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an empirical application of some {{recent developments in}} <b>the</b> social <b>science</b> <b>of</b> <b>sustainability</b> to understanding sustainable transport behaviour. We analyse talk about holidaymaking taken from interviews with self-defined “eco” or “sustainable” tourists. The focus of this paper explores {{the ways in which}} participants understand and reconcile the potential conflict of air transport and the notion of sustainable holidays. We identify a number of discursive strategies participants used to project and maintain positive self-representations in the context of complex, often incompatible constructions <b>of</b> <b>sustainability</b> derived from this particular dilemma. Such strategies are considered as concrete examples of the psychosocial organisation of denial and thus offer discursive barriers to sustainable transport futures. However, the analysis also demonstrates the ways in which some individuals were able to resist or challenge such forms of socially organised denial. The potential implications of these discursive barriers and strategies for sustainable transport futures and the tourism sector are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} based upon the {{understanding}} that fundamental disciplines of human knowledge such as chemistry, ecology, sociology, geology, economics, engineering or politics, cannot, by themselves, provide the sufficient and necessary solutions to complex problems <b>of</b> <b>sustainability.</b> The paper, therefore, presents an integrated knowledge approach to sustainability policy on industry with the understanding that the essence of such an approach is to enable and support stewardship for building a sustainable society by transcending the conflicts between the paradigm of economics and the paradigm of ecology. This is done by testing the complementarities of three functional modes of knowledge (contextual, technological, and reconciliatory) in actuating <b>the</b> policy <b>science</b> <b>of</b> <b>sustainability.</b> This {{is based upon}} an analysis of surveys on CP implementation motives, CP technologies and CP policies. The paper colludes with the finding that even when provided with impressive amounts of data, information and supportive opinion on specific sustainability issues, a society that is not sufficiently cognizant of the necessary knowledge synthesis processes will be unlikely to gain momentum in moving forward in the development, implementation and on-going support <b>of</b> industrial <b>sustainability</b> policy...|$|R
30|$|Nevertheless, {{there are}} also reasons to believe that such traps can be {{overcome}} through institutional changes and stakeholder engagements following the principles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> place-based <b>science</b> <b>of</b> <b>sustainability</b> (Kates et al. 2001; Kates and Parris 2003; Wu 2013; Wu et al. 2014, 2015). There are already several encouraging signs emerging. First, the population of Inner Mongolia, {{as well as the}} population of China as a whole, seems close to reaching a steady state in the near future, so do the total demands for food, water, and other essential life-supporting materials. Second, new policies from the central government and local governments have increasingly emphasized the “quality” (environmental impacts), instead of the “quantity” (GDP), of economic development. This is particularly evident in China’s 13 th Five-Year Plan, approved by China’s National People’s Congress in March of 2016, which provides the blueprint for the economic and social development of the country from 2016 to 2020. Third, as China’s socioeconomic development puts more emphasis on “quality,” people’s awareness and participation of protecting the environment are also increasing. These positive signs of government policy and stakeholders’ attitude towards nature are essential for a sustainable future of Inner Mongolia.|$|R
40|$|Sustainability is an {{important}} concept currently {{at the forefront of}} many policy agendas. Yet, <b>the</b> <b>science</b> <b>of</b> <b>sustainability</b> is still inchoate: What does it means for a system to be sustainable? What are the features of sustainable systems and how can they be quantified? The systems we deal with - ecological, economic, social, and integrated - are complex and operate by maintaining functional gradients away from equilibrium. While there are basic requirements regarding availability of input and output boundary flows and sinks, sustainability is centrally a feature of system configuration. A system must provide a basis of positionally-balancing, wholeness-enhancing centers of activity. One aspect of this system balance is between efficiency and redundancy which can be measured in ecological and economic systems using information-based network analysis. Specifically, the robustness indicator as developed by Robert Ulanowicz and colleagues offers deep insight into the structure and function of these self-sustaining autocatalytic configurations (through constant flows of energy and matter). In this paper, I overview these concepts and methods and provide examples from economic and ecological systems and discuss the meaning of the differences in outcome...|$|E

Yet, <b>the</b> <b>science</b> <b>of</b> <b>sustainability</b> is still inchoate: What does it means for a system to be sustainable? What are the features of sustainable systems and how can they be quantified? Systems ecology is built on Bertalanffy’s premise that organisms, like all complex adaptive systems, are self-organized and interactive. This shifted our perspective from a linear mechanism to models that required a broader, holistic orientation in order to understand fully the dynamics involved. These complex systems operate by maintaining functional gradients away from equilibrium. While there are basic requirements regarding availability of input and output boundary flows and sinks, sustainability is centrally a feature of system configuration. A system must provide a basis of positionally balancing, wholeness-enhancing centers of activity.

40|$|The Ecological Footprint (EF) is a {{powerful}} tool to advance <b>the</b> <b>science</b> <b>of</b> <b>sustainability.</b> However, the static snapshot of EF accounting is not designed to make projections of future sustainability consequences, which fails to elicit policy implications from a dynamic, temporally explicit perspective. This work attempts to incorporate system dynamics (SD) into EF to develop a dynamic EF forecasting framework, and provide a platform to support policy making for urban sustainability improvement. SD is firstly adopted to model the dynamics and interactions of EF driving forces, and then incorporated into the EF framework by correlating system drivers to EF-related consumption categories, embodied EF is finally calculated using the compound-based method. Based on different policy feasibility and sustainability targets, four policy scenarios are designed to explore future sustainability prospects and formulate integrated policies which would attain that sustainability scenario. The modeling procedure is applied to a case study area to illustrate how it works, and policy making for urban sustainability can hopefully be supported using this developed framework in the near future.

40|$|If {{we wish to}} {{understand}} how our species can adapt to the coming tide of environmental change, then understanding how we have adapted {{throughout the course of}} evolution is vital. Evolutionary biologists have been exploring these questions in the last forty years, establishing a solid record of evidence that conventional, individual-based models of natural selection are insufficient in explaining social evolution. More recently, this work has supported a growing consensus that our evolution, in which we have expressed extra-ordinary adaptive capacities, can best be explained by “Multi-level Selection”, a theory that includes the influence of both genes and culture to support unique adaptive capacities premised on pro-social behaviours and group selection, not individual-level competition for survival. Applying this scholarship to contemporary concerns about adapting to environmental change may be quite fruitful for identifying sources of vulnerability and adaptive capacity, thereby informing efforts to enhance the likelihood for sustainable futures.

The Ecological Footprint {{methodology}} is {{a framework}} that tracks Ecological Footprint (humanity’s demands on the biosphere) by comparing human demand against the regenerative capacity (Biocapacity) of the planet (WWF, 2010) to advance <b>the</b> <b>science</b> <b>of</b> <b>sustainability.</b> As such, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the Ecological Footprint (EF) and Biocapacity (BC) in a given watershed are important topics {{in the field of}} sustainability research based on remote sensing (RS) data and geographic information system (GIS) techniques．This paper reports on a case study of the Jinghe River Watershed using improved EF methodology with the help of GIS and high resolution remote sensing data, to quantitatively estimate the relationship between EF demand and BC supply and analyze their spatial distribution patterns at multiple spatial scales for four periods (1986, 1995, 2000 and 2008). We predict the future BC both overall, and of six categories of biological productivity area for the next four decades using the Markov Chain Method．The results showed that the spatial distribution of EF demand and BC supply were significantly uneven in the region, in which the per-capita EF of all counties located in the watershed increased continually from 1986 to 2008, and the EF per person of counties in the middle and lower reaches area was markedly greater than that in the upper reaches over time.

Across the world the number of {{tourists}} seeking close interaction with wildlife in their natural environment is growing. Understanding the interface between visitors (social) and wildlife (environmental) can make a critical contribution to the <b>sustainability</b> <b>of</b> this industry. This study examined wildlife tours in Australia. Questionnaires were posted to wildlife tour operators in Tasmania, Western Australia and Northern Territory, seeking information on the characteristics of tours, and <b>the</b> place <b>of</b> <b>science</b> and moni-toring in their business. The results illustrate several similarities between wildlife and ecotourism, suggesting the benefits of increasing education and interpretation, both central features of ecotourism, to enhancing the <b>sustainability</b> <b>of</b> wildlife tourism. For tour operators, interactive activities included feeding, swimming with and touching wildlife, and the level of interaction was identified as high, making it imperative to better define interaction and develop species or group-specific protocols for sustain-ably managing these interactions. Lastly, this study showed a low level of engagement of scientists in protecting the wildlife of interest to tours.

40|$|Science per se {{has always}} been advocating sustainability. The {{fundamentals}} of physical and biological sciences {{are based on the}} principles of thermodynamics and emphasize the need for efficiency and conservation. Thus, sustainability is a 'scientific' prerequisite, from the systems perspective of development. In studies of sustainable development, the terms 'science' and 'technology' are often used together - in tandem - as 'science & technology'. However, if one looks at the advancement of science & technology from a sustainability perspective, it may be said that it is becoming increasingly 'technological', but not duly 'scientific'. Instead of science-based technology, what we have developed today is a technology-based science, in our desperation to sustain the unsustainable. Corporate-funded research in industry as well as in academy is governed by profitability rather than ecological concern or disinterested scientific inquiry. In the guise of a 'knowledge-based economy', what we have constructed is an 'economy-based knowledge' indeed. Sustainability is not a goal but only a means and it is a science by itself, but, unlike conventional sciences, which are supposedly value free and amoral, <b>the</b> <b>science</b> <b>of</b> <b>sustainability</b> is inclusive not only of values and responsibilities but also of the institutions and instruments that stand for sustainability.
