40|$|Two {{formulations}} of EPDM elastomer, one substituting a UV stabilizer for the normal antioxidant in this polymer, {{and the other}} the normal formulation, were synthesized and samples of each were exposed to gamma irradiation in initially pure deuterium gas to compare their radiation stability. Stainless steel containers having rupture disks were designed for this task. After 130 MRad dose of cobalt- 60 radiation in the SRNL Gamma Irradiation Facility, {{a significant amount of}} gas was created by radiolysis; however the composition indicated by mass spectroscopy indicated an unexpected increase in the total amount deuterium in both formulations. The irradiated samples retained their ductility in a bend test. No change of sample weight, dimensions, or density was observed. No change of the glass transition temperature as measured by dynamic mechanical analysis was observed, and most of the other dynamic mechanical properties remained unchanged. There appeared to be an increase in the storage modulus of the irradiated samples containing the UV stabilizer above the glass transition, which may indicate hardening of the material by radiation damage. Polymeric materials become damaged by exposure over time to ionizing radiation. Despite the limited lifetime, polymers have unique engineering material properties and polymers continue to be used in tritium handling systems. In tritium handling systems, polymers are employed mainly in joining applications such as valve sealing surfaces (eg. Stem <b>tips,</b> <b>valve</b> packing, and O-rings). Because of the continued need to employ polymers in tritium systems, over the past several years, programs at the Savannah River National Laboratory have been studying the effect of tritium on various polymers of interest. In these studies, samples of materials of interest to the SRS Tritium Facilities (ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, Teflon{reg_sign}), Vespel{reg_sign} polyimide, and the elastomer ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM)) have been exposed in closed containers to tritium gas initially at 1 atmosphere pressure.

As a basic technique, laparoscopic total gastrectomy employed Roux-en-Y reconstruction, laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy employed double tract reconstruction, and end-to-side anastomosis {{was used for the}} cut-off stump of the esophagus and lifted jejunum. We used EEATM OrVilTM as a device that permitted mechanical purse-string suture similarly to conventional EEA, and endo-Surgitie. After the gastric lymph node dissection, the esophagus was cut off using an automated stapler. EEATM OrVilTM was orally and slowly inserted from the <b>valve</b> <b>tip,</b> and a small hole was created {{at the tip of the}} obliquely cut-off stump with scissors to let the <b>valve</b> <b>tip</b> pass through. Yarn was cut to disconnect the anvil from a tube and the anvil head was retained in the esophagus. The end-Surgitie was inserted at the right subcostal margin, and after the looped-shaped thread was wrapped around the esophageal stump opening, assisting Maryland forceps inserted at the left subcostal and left abdomen were used to grasp the left and right esophageal stump. The surgeon inserted anvil grasping forceps into the right abdomen, and after grasping the esophagus with the forceps, tightened the end Surgitie, thereby completing the purse-string suture on the esophageal stump. The main unit of the automated stapler was inserted from the cut-off stump of the lifted jejunum, and a trocar was made to pass through. To prevent dropout of the small intestines from the automated stapler, the automated stapler and the lifted jejunum were fastened with silk thread, the abdomen was again inflated, and the lifted jejunum was led into the abdominal cavity. When it was confirmed that the automated stapler and center rod were made completely linear, the anvil and the main unit were connected with each other and firing was carried out. Then, DST-based anastomosis was completed with no dog-ear. The method may facilitate safe laparoscopic anastomosis between the esophagus and reconstructed intestine. This is also considered to serve as a useful anastomosis technique for upper levels of the esophagus in laparotomy. </p...|$|R

MethodsForty-two AMI patients having undergone CR were enrolled in this observational study. Assessments were performed before and after 6 weeks of CR. Left atrial strain analysis was carried out by two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was measured by the biplane Simpson's method. Pulsed-wave Doppler at the <b>tip</b> of mitral <b>valve</b> leaflets enabled us to measure early (E) and late (A) diastolic filling velocities, deceleration time (DT) of early filling velocity and isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT). Left ventricle tissue velocity was measured by tissue Doppler imaging of the lateral mitral annulus (e’) and E/e’ was subsequently calculated. Ratio of E/e’ to left atrium (LA) peak strain was used to estimate LA stiffness.

Organs on the ovipositor of parasitoid wasps have mechanical and tactile senses that coordinate the complex movements of egg laying, and the ovipositor of Hymenopteran insects have evolved associated venom glands as part of their stinging defense. The ovipositor of parasitic wasps has evolved an additional function as a piercing organ that is required for the deposition of eggs within suitable host larvae. The morphology and ultrastructure of sense organs on the ovipositor and sheath of Macrocentrus cingulum Brischke (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) are described using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Three types of sensilla trichodea were shown to be abundant on the outer sheath of the ovipositor, with types II and III being most distal, and the inner surface of the ovipositor covered with microtrichia, more densely near the apex.

Our aim was to test the hypothesis that a combined application of different methods could improve the hemodynamic evaluation. Methods: 43 patients (pts) with catheterization determined wedge pressure (PCWP) were studied with transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography. The Doppler data at the mitral <b>valve</b> <b>tips</b> were analyzed for the peak E and A velocities, E at onset of A, E/A, acceleration time, deceleration time of E and A, atrial filling fraction and isovolumic relaxation time. Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) of the mitral annulus was used to acquire its diastolic velocities Ea and Aa. Parameters from transesophageal pulmonary venous systolic (S), diastolic (D), atrial reverse waves (Ar) and systolic fraction (SF) were also measured. Results: The ratio of E/Ea had the strongest relation to PCWP (r = 0. 85, PCWP = 1. 53 + 1. 48 E / Ea) irrespective of the mitral filling pattern. Univariate analysis revealed that only E/Ea was associated with PCWP (p = 0. 007). Multivariate analysis showed the combination of SF + E / Ea to be most predictive of PCWP (chi square = 11. 8, p = 0. 009).

40|$|The host {{acceptance}} behaviour in Aphidius ervi is investigated, {{assessing the}} role of both external and internal host-associated cues, offered to the experimental parasitoids with parafilm-made aphid dummies. The reaction to internal cues present in the host haemolymph is clearly evident, and its intensity is enhanced by external cues. Parasitoid females lay few eggs in aphid dummies filled with host haemolymph. A {{significant increase in the}} number of both oviposition reactions (host stinging) and egg laying is observed only when these dummies are coated with cornicle secretion. However, this enhancement is not observed when the aphid dummies contain distilled water.

The physiological basis of this behavioural response is investigated with a detailed study on the anatomy and ultrastructure of A. ervi ovipositor. The detection of chemical cues present in the host haemolymph that act as kairomones is made possible by the presence of gustatory sensilla on the tip of the ovipositor. These sensilla consist of porous areas, reached by unbranched dendrites running inside both the lower valves (i. e. first valvulae) and the unpaired upper valve (i. e. second valvulae).

5000|$|... "Over-arcing" [...] in this definition's context {{relates to}} one of two variables, {{dictated}} by which of two halves the rocker arm's pivotal axis resides in relation to the ensuing motion. In the strict definition, over-arcing pertains to the pivotal axis residing too low with regard to its starting point of motion, in providing a 90 degree relationship at exactly the mid-lift point of motion; whereby 90 degrees is reached (if ever) at some point AFTER the exact half way point of motion (mid-lift) occurs. In the opposite example to this definition, the rocker arm's pivotal axis sits too high with regard to the starting point (<b>valve</b> <b>tip)</b> of motion, thus effecting a sweep of its radial path that dominates beneath itself, whereby the 90 degree relationship of the linear component's axis (valve and push-rod, respectively) to the tangent points to the rocker arm's pivotal axis is acquired BEFORE the mid-lift point of movement is attained. In this example, the term used is under-arcing. As with over-arcing, the result in wasted motion is the same, but the consequences to the ever changing velocity delivered to the valve, which is dictated by where this 90 degree tangent point occurs, is opposite (in both symptoms and effect) to the phenomena of its counterpart. Although both terms are simple in principle, their consequences to the efficient design and implementation of high performance push-rod driven (and otherwise) valve trains is decisive.|$|R

The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of the sinus pocket on the flow dynamics in a prosthetic valve. MethodsA bench top in vitro experiment was set up at physiological flow conditions to simulate the flow inside a venous system. Bicuspid bioprosthetic valves with different leaflet lengths (5 and 10  mm) were tested in tubes with and without a sinus pocket and the flows around the valve were visualized by particle image velocimetry (PIV). Velocity data measurements were made and the vorticity was calculated in the with- and without-sinus set-ups. ResultsPIV measurements showed that vortex structure was maintained by the sinus. For the 10 -mm leaflet length design with sinus, the jet width at the exit of the valve was 59 % of that without sinus. For the 5 -mm design with sinus, the jet width was 73 % of the valve without sinus. Flow from the sinus region was entrained into the main jet observed near the exit of the sinus and altered the flow at the near wall region. ConclusionsThe sinus pocket alters the flow around the valve and functions as flow regulator to smooth the flow pattern around the valve. The vortical structure inside the sinus is maintained at the <b>valve</b> leaflet <b>tip</b> during the <b>valve</b> cycle.

The aim of {{this study}} was to set up {{reference}} values for Doppler flow-derived left ventricular filling parameters and to evaluate physiologic determinants of changes in signal expression related to maturation. Background. In left ventricular diastolic function studies, age-related modulations in signal expression are observed. Assuming degenerative myocardial changes to be absent during childhood and adolescence, the determinants of these modulations must be different from those suspected in adults. Methods. Pulsed wave Doppler signals from the mitral <b>valve</b> <b>tip</b> region were recorded in 329 healthy subjects aged 2 months to 39 years. Multiple linear regression was used to evaluate statistical relations between Doppler flow signals and stroke volume in the mitral valve area. Results. Increasing early filling time velocity integral throughout maturation caused a decrease in atrial filling fraction from 0. 34 ± 0. 06 to 0. 24 ± 0. 04 (p < 0. 005). Peak flow velocities during atrial systole decreased from infancy to adolescence (66 ± 15 to 41 ± 10 cm/s). Main effects on signal modulation were caused by heart rate, stroke volume and mitral ring area with a linear model fit (R 2) of 0. 79 for early filling phase (E) -time velocity integral, 0. 6 for atrial filling phase peak velocity 0. 84 for total E duration and 0. 73 for E deceleration time. Atrial filling phase-time velocity integral, albeit significantly dependent on heart rate, was stable throughout growth. Conclusions. During infancy and childhood, the stroke volume crossing the mitral valve is a main modulator for early filling phase (E) -time velocity integral and diastolic time intervals during early filling, whereas atrial filling phase parameters are mainly dependent on heart rate. This results in a more pronounced atrial filling during infancy and childhood...|$|R

A Green 2 ̆ 7 s function is formulated for a vertical point load on the elastic half-space (Lamb 2 ̆ 7 s problem) since the mathematical model of the half-space is easier to handle than that of the infinite plate. A numerical solution is obtained by evaluating the complex integral equations of the Green 2 ̆ 7 s function. A simple and efficient convolution scheme is developed for numerically extending this point {{solution to the problem of}} impact pressure distribution. A superposition algorithm is developed for the purpose of obtaining the displacements and stresses of the plate interior by utilizing the half-space solutions. The superposition method consists of two steps to satisfy the free boundary conditions of the plate, which is a unique feature of the algorithm. Several numerical results are presented for the half-space and infinite plate. ^ The three dimensional stress wave solution is compared with the one dimensional solution for certain limiting cases. The agreement of the two solutions is quite excellent. ^ The stress reversal phenomenon at the free boundary of the plate and the stress fluctuation near the S wave front indicate that the plate may fail earlier than expected by using conventional S-N curves. Thus, it is suggested that new S-N curves which incorporate the impact loading be constructed for a better compressor valve life prediction. ...|$|R

A thorough background review demonstrated that soot related wear is a major issue for the automotive and lubricants industry. A {{detailed analysis of the}} physical properties and effects of soot contaminated lubricants highlighted that there are associated effects that will tend to reduce engine perfonnance and efficiency. The actual wear that was produced is studied for the area of the engine which is most significantly affected by soot contamination, the valve train. A typical elephant's foot to <b>valve</b> <b>tip</b> contact, known to suffer from soot related wear, fonned the basis of the specimen ball-on-flat reciprocating wear testing. A standardised wear test rig and method were developed for the testing, which investigated different lubricants (base and fonnulated oil), increasing levels of soot contamination (using carbon black as a soot surrogate) and different temperatures. The results demonstrated significant increases in wear with increasing level of carbon black contamination. Furthennore, increased temperature tended {{to increase the amount of}} wear produced and using a fonnulated lubricant reduced the amount of wear measured when compared to tests using base oil. Significant changes in wear mechanism were visible from surface imaging ofthe wear scars, showing initially lubricated sliding, which changes to abrasion at higher contamination levels, and then shifting to contact starvation as the contamination significantly reduces the flow of lubricant into the contact at very high contamination levels. Significantly, the severity of the effects of soot contamination was due to the lubricant film thickness in the contact and therefore ultimately the lubrication regime within which it is operating. Where boundary lubrication is significantly affected by soot contaminated lubricants, but these effects are reduced when the contact operates under elastohydrodynamic (EHD) lubrication conditions. A region of the engine that is significantly affected by soot contaminated oil is the contact between the piston and the cylinder wall or liner. This is mainly due to the component's proximity to the area where soot in produced. Wear will occur in this highly sensitive region due to the breakdown of the protective oil film, which will occur when the lubricant is contaminated with soot. A method of analysing the effect sO~as been investigated 'using an ultrasonic technique to measure the oil film between a piston and a cylinder wall or liner. The ultrasonic oil film thickness measurement technique (developed at the University of Sheffield) has been used in many static and dynamic applications; therefore an initial trial was performed on a single cylinder engine, demonstrating some success. A motored test engine was then built on which to develop the technique and to provide a platform for future research. The test engine demonstrated potential for future success, as a variety of ultrasonic transducers were tested. Testing also highlighted that significant future work, regarding reducing electrical interference, improving the data processing electronics and further investigations into the different types of transducer is required to improve the technique.
