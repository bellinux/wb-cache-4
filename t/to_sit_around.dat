25|$|The F121 engine had a rare set {{of design}} {{parameters}} {{as it is}} designed to be used only once. As a cruise missile engine, it was designed to have a long shelf life (be able <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> unused for long periods of time) and then operate when needed for several hours. It was designed to power the AGM-136 Tacit Rainbow, which was to be a stand-off anti radiation missile. Its first flight was on July 30, 1984. The AGM-136 program was canceled several years later.|$|E
25|$|The {{relative}} infrequency of SWAT call-outs means these expensively {{trained and}} equipped officers cannot be left <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>around,</b> {{waiting for an}} emergency. In many departments the officers are normally deployed to regular duties, but are available for SWAT calls via pagers, mobile phones, or radio transceivers. Even in the larger police agencies, such as the LAPD or the NYPD, SWAT personnel will normally be seen in crime suppression roles—specialized and more dangerous than regular patrol, perhaps, but the officers would not be carrying their distinctive armor and weapons.|$|E
25|$|Eugene Nagel {{became aware}} of Pantridge's work in 1967. He {{believed}} that the physician-staffed model of prehospital care {{was not going to}} work for the United States in general or for Miami in particular. Physicians were too expensive <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> fire stations waiting for calls, and if they had to be picked up in hospitals, it would take too long to arrive at the scene. When Nagel or his colleague James Hirschman, rode on the ambulance themselves they could, of course, defibrillate and provide medications, but they could not be present on all shifts. Nagel became convinced {{it was time to move}} away from a program using physicians to one staffed by paramedics.|$|E

25|$|The {{chapter house}} is of {{exceptional}} quality {{and in a}} good state of preservation. It is fronted by three heavily decorated round arches of the late 13th century, the larger centre arch a doorway and the flanking arches originally windows. The shafts between were built with carved capitals, {{but a series of}} sculptures of saints was added to them in the 14th century. The chapter house was substantially remodelled in the 16th century, perhaps subsequent to the complaints about its condition under Abbot Pontesbury. There is no trace of the original seating, which would have allowed the canons <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> the walls of the building. The chapter house was demolished after the dissolution, apart from the western arches and south side, with another building taking its place. This was fitted with an impressive moulded, wooden ceiling, probably moved from another part of the abbey. This remains in place. The parlour would have been next to the chapter house but nothing remains of it.|$|E

He cited surrealist films Eraserhead and Un Chien Andalou (as mentioned in [...] "Debaser") as major influences on his work with the Pixies; however, surrealism was less of an influence in his solo career. He commented on these influences (which he paid tribute to most in the Pixies' Doolittle), saying he [...] "didn't have the patience <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> reading Surrealist novels", but found it easier to watch 20-minute films.|$|E

Marshall canceled its football program in 1943 as Gatski entered his senior year, but his unit was activated and he was sent with an infantry division {{to fight in the}} European theater of World War II. He went to England and followed American troops as they landed in Normandy and marched further into Europe. [...] "I wasn't in any heavy fighting," [...] he later said. He was a Private First Class in the Army. Gatski returned from duty in 1945, but Marshall had yet to resume its football program, so he enrolled at Auburn University in Alabama and finished out his studies, playing part of the season on the school's football team.

On the House floor he said, [...] "hat I am trying to prevent is the holocaust of our children getting STDs, AIDS, and various other diseases {{that are going to}} affect their lives.

2500|$|Roberts once stated: [...] "You're {{going to}} be {{unemployed}} if {{you really think you}} just have <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> and wait for the muse to land on your shoulder." [...] She concentrates on one novel at a time, writing eight hours a day, every day, even while on vacation. Rather than begin with an outline or plot summary, Roberts instead envisions a key incident, character, or setting. She then writes a short first draft that has the basic elements of a story. After finishing the first draft, Roberts goes {{back to the beginning of}} the novel. The second draft usually sees the addition of details, the [...] "texture and color" [...] of the work, as well as a more in-depth study of the characters. She then does a final pass to polish the novel before sending it to her agent, Amy Berkower.|$|E
2500|$|The bridal dress, {{designed}} by the London-based designer Sarah Burton at Alexander McQueen, was made of satin and featured an overlaid lace bodice and appliqued skirt. The lace bodice incorporated machine-made lace, sourced from manufacturers in France and Britain. Floral motifs were cut from lengths of these and then appliquéd by hand onto silk net (tulle) by workers from the Royal School of Needlework. The veil was {{held in place by}} a Cartier Scroll Tiara, made in 1936 and lent to her by the Queen. It was purchased by the Queen's father, the future King George VI, for his wife Elizabeth three weeks before his accession. Princess Elizabeth (now Queen Elizabeth II) received the tiara from her mother on her 18th birthday. In order to avoid her tiara falling off, as had happened for Lady Diana Spencer while wearing a Spencer family tiara during her 1981 wedding to the Prince of Wales, Catherine's stylists [...] "backcombed the top [...] to create a foundation for the tiara <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>around,</b> then did a tiny plait in the middle and sewed it on." ...|$|E

A follower of the Prairie Style and its ideal of [...] "organic architecture," [...] Jensen designed the garden to reflect an idealized vision of the Midwestern woods and prairies. In his 1935 design, Jensen placed eight council rings, his design icon, throughout the Garden. These fire circles, built of Midwestern splitstone, are designed for groups of 12-50 people <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> together <b>around</b> an open fire. Most of the fire circles are situated to give all participants a view of Lake Springfield. By sitting in a fire circle, visitors {{have the opportunity to}} balance the four elements within themselves.|$|R

In Italy the circular or polygonal form was used throughout the medieval period for baptisteries, while in England it was adapted for chapter houses. In France the aisled polygonal plan was adapted as the eastern terminal and in Spain the same form is often used as a chapel.|$|R
2500|$|The title character, Beowulf, {{is portrayed}} by Ray Winstone. Zemeckis cast Winstone after seeing his {{performance}} as the title character of the 2003 ITV serial Henry VIII. On {{the topic of the}} original poem, Winstone commented during an interview, [...] "I had the beauty of not reading the book, which I understand portrays Beowulf as a very one-dimensional kind of character; a hero and a warrior and that was it. I didn't have any of that baggage to bring with me." [...] Winstone enjoyed working with motion capture, stating that [...] "You were allowed to go, like theater, where you carry a scene on and you become engrossed within the scene. I loved the speed of it. There was no time <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>around.</b> You actually cracked on with a scene and your energy levels were kept up. There was no time to actually sit around and lose your concentration. So, for me, I actually really, really enjoyed this experience." [...] Unlike some of his castmates, Winstone's animated counterpart bears little resemblance to the actor who was in his early 50s when he filmed the role; Winstone noted that his computer-generated counterpart resembled himself at the age of eighteen, although the filmmakers did not have a photo for reference. Winstone also played a dwarf performer, and the [...] "Golden Man"/Dragon.|$|E

Marlette would produce an EP for Lowery's short-lived band, Red Square Black, entitled Square. The duo also helped write and record much of David Lee Roth's DLR Band album. The blueprint for 2wo began in October 1995, when Halford first met Lowery.
