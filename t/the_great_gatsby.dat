Considered to be Fitzgerald's magnum opus, <b>The</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Gatsby</b> explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that {{has been described as a}} cautionary tale regarding the American Dream.|$|E

5|$|After the fight, the Fitzgeralds kept up {{appearances}} {{with their}} friends, seeming happy. In September, Zelda overdosed on sleeping pills.

They attempted to celebrate with travel to Rome and Capri, but both were unhappy and unhealthy. When he received the proofs from his novel he fretted over the title: Trimalchio in West Egg, just Trimalchio or Gatsby, Gold-hatted Gatsby, or The High-bouncing Lover.

40|$|The {{article is}} {{dedicated}} to the factors contributing to the greatness of “The <b>Great</b> <b>Gatsby</b> ” by F. Sc. Fitzgerald. The following factors are analyzed: title, eternal topics, hero (and not just major character), going beyond genres, exquisite language and style, sophisticated and simultaneously simple plot, being place-bound and cosmopolitan as well as historic and timeless. This greatness has been time-tested. Gatsby is an American Don Quixote of the 1920 s, ridiculous and charming at the same time. However (or that is why), millions of women all over the world would like to meet their Gatsby...|$|R

5|$|Fitzgerald's {{visits to}} Long Island's south shore and his {{experience}} attending parties at mansions inspired The Great Gatsbys setting. Today, {{there are a}} number of theories as to which mansion was the inspiration for the book. One possibility is Land's End, a notable Gold Coast Mansion where Fitzgerald may have attended a party. Many of the events in Fitzgerald's early life are reflected throughout <b>The</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Gatsby.</b> Fitzgerald was a young man from Minnesota, and like Nick, he was educated at an Ivy League school, Princeton (in Nick's case, Yale). Fitzgerald is also similar to Jay Gatsby, in that he fell in love while stationed far from home in the military and fell into a life of decadence trying to prove himself to the girl he loved. Fitzgerald became a second lieutenant, and was stationed at Camp Sheridan, in Montgomery, Alabama. There he met and fell in love with a wild seventeen-year-old beauty named Zelda Sayre. Zelda finally agreed to marry him, but her preference for wealth, fun, and leisure led her to delay their wedding until he could prove a success. Like Nick in <b>The</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Gatsby,</b> Fitzgerald found this new lifestyle seductive and exciting, and, like Gatsby, he had always idolized the very rich. In many ways, <b>The</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Gatsby</b> represents Fitzgerald's attempt to confront his conflicting feelings about the Jazz Age. Like Gatsby, Fitzgerald was driven by his love for a woman who symbolized everything he wanted, even as she led him toward everything he despised.|$|E

2500|$|Variety {{called it}} [...] "a distended, talky, {{redundant}} and moody melodrama" [...] and added, [...] "The overemphasis on Streisand makes the film just {{another one of}} those Streisand vehicles where no other elements ever get a chance." [...] Time Out London observed, [...] "ith the script glossing whole areas of confrontation (from the Communist '30s to the McCarthy witch-hunts), it often passes into the haze of a nostalgic fashion parade. Although Streisand's liberated Jewish lady is implausible, and emphasizes the period setting as just so much dressing, Redford's Fitzgerald-type character [...] [...] [...] is an intriguing trailer for his later <b>Great</b> <b>Gatsby.</b> It's a performance that brings more weight to the film than it deserves, often hinting at depths that are finally skated over." ...|$|R
