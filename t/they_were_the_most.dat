5|$|Atlético versus América {{was known}} as the Clássico das Multidões ("Derby of the Masses") before the {{construction}} of the Mineirão, as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> popular clubs in the state. In their first years, América {{was known as}} an elitist club, while Atlético had popular appeal; the former dominated {{the early years of the}} encounter, winning ten consecutive Campeonato Mineiro titles from 1916 to 1925. In the 1930s, Atlético pioneered professionalization of football in Minas Gerais, whereas América resisted against it. From that time on, Galo became the major force between the two, with América suffering a setback as a result of its internal disagreements regarding professionalism.|$|E
5|$|In 1885 he {{was made}} a Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George as thanks from the {{government}} for allowing the use of maps of the Upper Nile valley he had had made when working on the Khedive's projects. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> accurate survey of the area and {{were used in the}} British Relief of Khartoum. In 1887 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Northern triptychs and polyptychs {{were popular}} across Europe {{from the late}} 14th century, with the peak of demand lasting until the early 16th century. During the 15th century, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> widely {{produced}} format of northern panel painting. Preoccupied with religious subject matter, they come in two broad types: smaller, portable private devotional works, or larger altarpieces for liturgical settings. The earliest northern examples are compound works incorporating engraving and painting, usually with two painted wings that could be folded over a carved central corpus.|$|E

5|$|The Lexington-class {{ships were}} {{originally}} designed to be battlecruisers, with heavy guns, high speed, and moderate armor protection. The Navy laid down six ships of the class in 1919–20. When the battlecruisers were cancelled under the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, two of the unfinished ships were designated for completion as carriers. Lexington and Saratoga were selected since <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> advanced of the six ships in construction.|$|E
5|$|A few teams {{expressed}} interest in St. Louis. He chose to sign with the Tampa Bay Lightning as he believed <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> likely to give him playing time in the NHL. He made his debut with the team on October 6, 2000. He struggled at first, failing to score a goal {{in the first six}} weeks of the season and again found himself out of the lineup at times. Realizing that he was at a career crossroads, St. Louis abandoned the changes to his game that his NHL coaches had impressed on him, trusting his own instincts. He scored his first goal of the season in late November, and finished the season with 18 goals and 40 points – 34 of which came after December 1.|$|E
5|$|On {{the outer}} {{fringes of the}} few small gay {{communities}} were people who challenged gender expectations. They were effeminate men and masculine women, or people assigned male at birth who dressed and lived as women and people assigned female at birth who dressed and lived as men, respectively, either part or full-time. Contemporary nomenclature classified them as transvestites, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> visible representatives of sexual minorities. They belied the carefully crafted image portrayed by the Mattachine Society and DOB that asserted homosexuals were respectable, normal people. The Mattachine and DOB considered the trials of being arrested for wearing clothing of the opposite gender as a parallel to the struggles of homophile organizations: similar but distinctly separate. Gay and transgender people staged a small riot at the Cooper Do-nuts cafe in Los Angeles in 1959 in response to police harassment.|$|E

5|$|The current taxonomic {{arrangement}} of the Banksia genus is based on botanist Alex George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this arrangement, B.canei is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, because its inflorescences {{take the form of}} Banksias characteristic flower spikes; section Banksia because of its straight styles; and series Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. Kevin Thiele placed it in a subseries Integrifoliae, where he found strong support for it and B.saxicola to be each other's closest relative. The two were a sister group (i.e. next closest relative) to the four then-recognised subspecies of B.integrifolia. The subseries all bear whorled leaves apart from B.canei and B.aquilonia. However, this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George. He did place the two subalpine taxa (B.canei and B.saxicola) {{at the end of the}} sequence as he thought <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> recently evolved species, since he considered the group to have a tropical origin and B.dentata to be the oldest lineage.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, initial {{support to}} develop {{alternative}} fuels {{by the government}} was also {{a response to the}} first oil crisis, and some time later, as a goal to improve air quality. Also, liquid fuels were preferred over gaseous fuels not only because they have a better volumetric energy density but also because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> compatible fuels with existing distribution systems and engines, thus avoiding a big departure from the existing technologies and taking advantage of the vehicle and the refueling infrastructure. California led the search of sustainable alternatives with interest focused in methanol. Ford Motor Company and other automakers responded to California's request for vehicles that run on methanol. In 1981, Ford delivered 40 dedicated methanol fuel (M100) Escorts to Los Angeles County, but only four refueling stations were installed. The biggest challenge in the development of alcohol vehicle technology was getting all of the fuel system materials compatible with the higher chemical reactivity of the fuel. Methanol was even more of a challenge than ethanol but much of the early experience gained with neat ethanol vehicle production in Brazil was transferable to methanol. The success of this small experimental fleet of M100s led California to request more of these vehicles, mainly for government fleets. In 1983, Ford built 582 M100 vehicles; 501 went to California, and the remaining to New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E
