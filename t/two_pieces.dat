5|$|Offshore, a 30,000ton freighter, the MV Korean Star, {{sustained}} extreme damage {{during the}} storm. Rough seas caused {{the hull of}} the ship to break and the vessel was separated into <b>two</b> <b>pieces.</b> Although the freighter was in <b>two</b> <b>pieces,</b> the ship did not sink and the wreckage of it came ashore near Cape Cuvier. No one on the ship sustained injury as all 19 crew members abandoned ship. The crew was rescued within a day of sustaining the damage and flown to Carnarvon.|$|E

Laguna City was completed in 1991 and Sceneway Garden was completed in 1992.|$|E
5|$|The Xenogears Original Soundtrack is the {{official}} soundtrack to Square's role-playing video game Xenogears. It was composed by Yasunori Mitsuda and contains 44 tracks, including a Bulgarian choral song and <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> performed by the Irish singer Joanne Hogg. Though the game was released in both Japan and North America, the album was published in Japan exclusively as a 2-CD set on March 1, 1998.|$|E

50|$|The {{most basic}} {{breakdown}} of stock types is into one-piece and <b>two</b> <b>piece</b> stocks. A one piece stock {{is a single}} unit from butt to fore-end, such as that commonly found on bolt action rifles. <b>Two</b> <b>piece</b> stocks use a separate piece for the butt and fore-end, such as that commonly found on break open shotguns, and lever-action rifles and shotguns. Traditionally, <b>two</b> <b>piece</b> stocks were easier to make, since finding a wood blank suitable for a long one piece stock is harder than finding short blanks for a <b>two</b> <b>piece</b> stock.|$|R

5|$|Welds can be geometrically {{prepared}} {{in many different}} ways. The five basic types of weld joints are the butt joint, lap joint, corner joint, edge joint, and T-joint (a variant of this last is the cruciform joint). Other variations exist as well—for example, double-V preparation joints are characterized by the <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> of material each tapering to a single center point at one-half their height. Single-U and double-U preparation joints are also fairly common—instead of having straight edges like the single-V and double-V preparation joints, they are curved, forming {{the shape of a}} U. Lap joints are also commonly more than <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> thick—depending on the process used and the thickness of the material, many pieces can be welded together in a lap joint geometry.|$|E
5|$|Although many of {{his works}} feature his {{signature}} aliens, no <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> are alike. The subject matter may also be themed and adapted to their context. Invader's repertoire of subjects includes Star Wars characters, the Pink Panther and Mega Man, Spider-Man, Hong Kong Phooey, Thomas from Kung-Fu Master and Popeye. Sites near major bank buildings are marked with dollar sign mosaics, those in Hong Kong have an oriental theme.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's {{influence}} is marked {{in the first}} <b>two</b> <b>pieces.</b> Orledge observes that the right-hand figuration {{at the end of}} No 1 is remarkably similar to {{that at the end of}} Chopin's Waltz in E minor. In No 2 Nectoux detects the additional influence of Liszt (Au bord d'une source) in the opening bars. In the closing bars of No 2, Orledge finds a resemblance to the end of Chopin's Grande Valse Brillante, Op, 18.|$|E
50|$|Burial 8 {{contained}} {{a fragment of}} a wooden tray and a <b>two</b> <b>piece</b> wooden object. One of the pieces slotted into the other, leading archaeologists to speculate that the <b>two</b> <b>pieced</b> object {{was some kind of}} hafting device. In this case, human remains lay under a fabric shroud.|$|R
40|$|The {{thermal stress}} field of a <b>two</b> <b>piece</b> turbine shroud seal concept was {{analyzed}} and results compared to one piece designs by finite element analysis. The <b>two</b> <b>piece</b> seal has independently formed structure (substrate) and ceramic components that are assembled at ambient conditions. The boundary conditions used for analysis were hot gas surface temperatures of 1370 and 1650 C (2500 and 3000 F) and cooled surface temperature of 700 C (1285 F). The resulting thermal stress field, of the <b>two</b> <b>piece</b> seal {{when compared to}} the one piece seals in the region of all ceramic material, was reduced substantially...|$|R

5|$|Cockroaches {{appear to}} use just <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> of {{information}} to decide where to go, namely how dark {{it is and how}} many other cockroaches there are. A study used specially-scented roach-sized robots that appear to the roaches as real to demonstrate that once there are enough insects in a place to form a critical mass, the roaches accepted the collective decision on where to hide, even if this was an unusually light place.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1943 Petrov {{notified}} the People's Commissar of Armaments Dmitriy Ustinov {{about the new}} project. On 13 April Ustinov informed Petrov that the State Committee of Defence had requested for five of the new guns {{to be sent to}} the testing grounds on 1 May. On 5 May, <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> were received for trials; two days later, on 7 May the gun was recommended for adoption, and on 8 August 1943 it was officially adopted as the 152mm howitzer M1943. One and a half months later, the first series production D-1 howitzers were delivered to the Red Army representatives.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} {{fifty years after}} 1945, every {{published}} description and drawing of the Little Boy mechanism assumed that a small, solid projectile was fired {{into the center of}} a larger, stationary target. However, critical mass considerations dictated that in Little Boy the larger, hollow piece would be the projectile. The assembled fissile core had more than two critical masses of uranium-235. This required one of the <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> to have more than one critical mass, with the larger piece avoiding criticality prior to assembly by means of shape and minimal contact with the neutron-reflecting tungsten carbide tamper.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, KFC International {{launched}} the Krusher (Krushem in some markets) line of frozen beverages. The product {{was an attempt}} to introduce a between-meals snack to KFC, and was marketed towards teenagers. In April 2010, the Double Down sandwich was launched. Criticised as an unhealthy product, it featured <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> of fried chicken in lieu of a conventional bread bun. It {{has proved to be a}} success for the company, with 15 million Double Downs sold worldwide between March 2011 and March 2013. In September 2012, the Chicken Little sandwich returned in the US.|$|E
5|$|Numerous deities {{have been}} {{considered}} patrons of third-sex or homoerotically-inclined people. This patronage can originate in mythological stories about the deity, or from religious practices and rituals. For example, Conner and Sparks argue that the goddess of fire, love and sexuality, Arani, {{has been linked to}} lesbian eroticism via rituals in her honor: for example <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> of wood perceived as feminine, called the adhararani and utararani, are rubbed together, simulating a spiritual lesbian interaction.|$|E
5|$|Shostakovich's orchestral works include 15 symphonies and six concerti. His chamber output {{includes}} 15 string quartets, a piano quintet, two piano trios, and <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> for string octet. His solo piano works {{include two}} sonatas, an early set of preludes, and a later set of 24 preludes and fugues. Other works include three operas, several song cycles, ballets, and a substantial quantity of film music; especially well known is The Second Waltz, Op. 99, {{music to the}} film The First Echelon (1955–1956), {{as well as the}} suites of music composed for The Gadfly.|$|E

5|$|Some comets {{have been}} {{observed}} to break up during their perihelion passage, including great comets West and Ikeya–Seki. Biela's Comet was one significant example, when it broke into <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> during its passage through the perihelion in 1846. These two comets were seen separately in 1852, but never again afterward. Instead, spectacular meteor showers were seen in 1872 and 1885 when the comet should have been visible. A minor meteor shower, the Andromedids, occurs annually in November, and it is caused when the Earth crosses the orbit of Biela's Comet.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} apparatus {{was only}} suitable for small fires, and was supplemented in 1902 with a steam-operated pumper and a hose wagon, both horse-drawn. The <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> of equipment were purchased by Walter Law's Briarcliff Realty Company and were loaned {{to the fire}} company without charge. At the time, the fire company housed its equipment and horses at the Briarcliff Farms' Barn A (present-day St. Theresa's School) and used the Wheelwright shop as a meeting room and for social events.|$|E

5|$|The magician John Nevil Maskelyne {{also criticized}} {{the design of}} the {{experiment}} for taking place under a table. The psychologist Millais Culpin wrote the experiment was not scientific and questioned why the experiment was done under the table instead of in a more convenient position on top of it. Before the accordion experiment with Crookes, Home had performed the accordion feat for over fifteen years under various conditions but always under his control. It was reported by sitters and Crookes that Home's accordion played only <b>two</b> <b>pieces,</b> Home Sweet Home and The Last Rose of Summer. Both contain only one-octave.|$|E
