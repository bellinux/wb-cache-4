[...] Her first parts there included Lola in Cavalleria rusticana and Preziosilla in the premiere of a new production of La forza del destino, and by years end she was singing Carmen, a key role she would later bring to Geneva, London, and the Metropolitan Opera spring tour. Eventually at Hamburg she would sing, in her words, [...] "just about every mezzo role around."But it was the Aix-en-Provence Festival in 1966 (for which Liebermann himself had recommended her) that saw her breakthrough performance in Richard Strausss Ariadne auf Naxos (to the Ariadne of Régine Crespin). In her role debut as the Composer, wrote Elizabeth Forbes, [...] "she made a heart-breaking—and heart-broken—adolescent, whose voice, in Strausss great paean to the power of music, soared into the warm, Provencal night and seemed to hang there like the stars of a rocket." [...] That performance, followed by her first Octavian in Strausss Der Rosenkavalier at Londons Covent Garden in 1968 (to the Marschallin of Lisa Della Casa), effectively initiated her international career—although, said Liebermann, [...] "she returned to Hamburg unspoiled" [...] after her triumph at Aix and [...] "took up her modest engagements as if nothing had happened." [...] The early success at Aix was caught by French television and a kinescope has been preserved.|$|E

5000|$|Erin Hershey Presley {{was cast}} as Alison Barrington in 2000. For {{the first two}} years of her run, Alisons love {{interest}} was Jamal Woods. The character was crafted as, at first, shallow and spoiled. She then softened to be playful and charming. The breakup with Jamal and the romance with Rafe Kovich developed her into full adulthood. Rafe was created in 2001 as a vampire slayer and an angel. Brian Gaskill, who had portrayed an angel before in the short film Higher Grounds, was cast in the part. Gaskill told Soap Opera Weekly he was excited to be playing an angel again. [...] "Theres something about having that light," [...] he said in the interview. [...] "Playing someone who comes from there is very freeing." [...] Rafe was written as [...] "unconventional," [...] allowing Gaskill to infuse his own [...] "offbeatness" [...] into the role. On other programs, he was not allowed the same freedoms to make the acting choices he wanted. [...] "I would make choices on some shows and theyd say, <b>Thats</b> <b>really</b> quirky and interesting, but guess what? Not on this show! Youve got to be the good-looking cool guy." [...] Gaskill credited the role for helping him in his personal life as well as with his acting. [...] "It has opened me up as much as an actor and as a person in ways that I never expected," [...] he said in an interview with Soap Opera Update. [...] "Its been a little bit of back and forth between me and Rafe. Im bringing to Rafe, but Rafe is giving to me. Thats where Im at. Sort of a coming of age a little late." ...|$|E

We mixed it all at one time, but we recorded it... well, just look at the credits: L.A., New York, Boston, Rockford, Chicago, Nashville, Florida. So <b>thats</b> <b>really</b> it. I think the longest we were in one spot was maybe a week. We travel all the time, so were already traveling. We say, lets try out this studio; if weve got extra time available, and our gear is here, lets do it. That way were kind of on the road. And its not like, if you get stuck, and something is not working, youre sitting there for a month trying to figure out something. You decide, well, thats good enough. But this way we get to let the songs breathe a bit. There was good stuff we left off. Its not like we took only the best. Of course, good stuff, but theres some other stuff that is equal or better than some of the things that are on there that was left off because, well, I dont want to put it out until its finished. Robins got one great song we took off. But he was uncomfortable with it. Hey, youve got to respect that. I chose to have it on, but he decided to leave it off. Being a songwriter, I know when something is missing and you dont like it. And if you settle; youre mad forever, because its on an album." ...|$|E

Fortunately everybody (in the play) is incredibly talented (and) really lovely people too and it has been an incredible learning experience for me. Its not my responsibility to draw (the audience) in, I just have to play the character. The way I would perform songs was always about the lyrics and always about trying to speak to everybody and make them watch and believe what Im saying and I suppose Im essentially doing that here but Im not looking at the audience Im obviously looking at the other actors.Im really happy to do this. I feel rejuvenated by it, I feel excited again. Youre very much alive, youre very much in the moment, so I feel Im really living.After I released my solo record I felt really disappointed, I believed in the record I made but if you dont have the back-up of your record company investing and marketing it. Its a really tough job and because I wrote the whole thing I really believed in this record, as did Nellee Hooper, I was jaded and disappointed.Last year I decided Im not doing music until Im excited again, then this came along and also I did end up making another record which Ill release at some point. Its just being mastered, its a lovely album; I didnt write this one, this is old songs and I have to sort out my situation- I dont want the same problem as before.I think everybodys enjoyed doing their own thing.

Our mother and father were really were great parents and they hope to be as good a mother as mine, but Sharons making her own record and will hopefully release it at some point.

40|$|Intestinal worms in goats Cue: Goats are a {{livestock}} species {{which many}} farmers find easier to keep. They tend to multiply quickly and owners are soon {{able to get}} a return on their investment. They also have a high immunity to disease. However, once in a while, young goats do die, and often the cause of death is internal parasites, such as tape worms, round worms and liver flukes. To find out more about how farmers can protect their goats, particularly their young animals, from the danger of internal parasites Patrick Mphaka spoke to Michael Watson Chikafa, Assistant Veterinary Officer in Blantyre District, Malawi. He began by asking how a farmer can recognise when his animal is infected. IN:		?Whenever a goat has been infected ? OUT:		?keep the disease most of the time. ? DUR?N		 3 ? 13 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Michael Watson Chikafa with some advice on de-worming goat flocks, in particular to protect young animals. Transcript Chikafa	Whenever a goat has been infected with worms, the most likely thing that is noticed is a pot belly, emaciation, and the hair itself doesn?t look all that good, and there is loss of appetite, most of the times, and sometimes what you notice is just sudden death. Mphaka	<b>That?s</b> <b>really</b> dangerous to see a goat dying because it has got worms. Is there anything else which farmers can do once they notice the symptoms which you have just talked about? Chikafa	When a farmer realizes {{that there is a problem}} of the sort, most of the time what he has to do is to look for veterinary services. All he has to do is simply just to go to any veterinary station where he can get assistance. Mphaka	Why do you think these problems affect the young goats and not the other goats of other ages? Chikafa	These parasites most of the times they affect the young ones just because their immune status is just too low for them to resist. It does not necessarily mean that the older ones do not have them; they do have them but only that they are immune enough to protect themselves. Hence they do not suffer much from those parasites. Mphaka	How does one goat which is safe get infected? Chikafa	This problem is transmitted from one goat to another through droppings because whenever the feed is somehow contaminated with the droppings, eggs remain on the feed and when the other animal takes that feed, it gets infected right away. Mphaka	Now, since the interest when we have the domesticated animals is normally to assist us as humans for meat, is there any danger for one to consume a goat which has got this problem? Chikafa	Provided the meat has been inspected by professionals, it has no harm. But there is danger if ever people take the meat which is not inspected; there is a danger of contracting some of these diseases because some of the tapeworms are transmissible to human beings through meat. Mphaka	When you are talking about round worms, tape worms, liver flukes, are they the same ones which sometimes we can say ?this person is suffering from round worms? and people go to hospital. Is this the same disease you are talking about? Chikafa	There isn?t much of a difference because most of the worms we do suffer, normally we contract them from our own domestic animals. Mphaka	If somebody stays a bit far from a veterinary office, is there any emergency treatment which they can do before they pay an actual visit to an office? Chikafa	The only advice I can give to a farmer with animals is simply just to have some of the worm drugs ready. Normally, de-worming is supposed to be done at regular intervals, more especially during the rainy season. After three to four months, they have to be de-wormed as well. During the dry season they have to be de-wormed. In so they doing, a farmer mostly will have a healthy flock. Mphaka	When you do the de-worming, do you target the smaller ones or the old ones as well? Chikafa	We de-worm the whole flock because if we target only the young ones, definitely they will still contract the same disease from the old ones, since the old ones are immune enough to keep the disease most of the time. End of track. Michael Watson Chikafa, Assistant Veterinary Officer in Blantyre district, Malawi...|$|E
