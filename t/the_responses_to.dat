5|$|Wollstonecraft was {{compared}} with such leading lights as the theologian and controversialist Joseph Priestley and Paine, whose Rights of Man (1791) {{would prove to}} be the most popular of <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> Burke. She pursued the ideas she had outlined in Rights of Men in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), her most famous and influential work. Wollstonecraft's fame extended across the English channel, for when the French statesmen Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord visited London in 1792, he visited her, during which she asked that French girls be given the same right to an education that French boys were being offered by the new regime in France.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes are {{involved}} in defending the territory. One aspect of territorial defense involves identifying {{the proximity of the}} threat based on the loudness of bird song as well as the level of degradation of the calls. In experiments involving playback, the wrens are capable of discriminating between degraded and undegraded songs, as well as degraded songs in the same acoustic conditions, and can detect changes of acoustic properties within their territories, such as songs under foliage. Song degradation {{can also be used to}} determine the proximity of potential intruders. If the song of a bird appears to be degraded, the wrens will assume that the threat is distant not respond; if the song is not degraded, they respond by attacking. Not all birds within their territory are potential enemies. Some species of birds that are neighbors are designated as 'dear-enemies' by the wrens, and <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> neighbors and intruders in their territories differ by the season. In spring, the wrens respond more aggressively toward neighbors, though in the fall, no major discrepancy in responses is shown. When protecting their nest, alarm calls are the general response. The wrens judge the size of the potential threat, such as a blue jay and avoid the risk of injury when attacking. Countersinging produced by intruder birds is more likely to be taken as an aggressive threat to male Carolina wrens.|$|E
5|$|Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark {{retreated from}} Wollstonecraft's earlier focus on God as judge to God as mere creator, {{shocking}} some conservative readers {{who were not}} prepared to accept anything akin to deism. Worried more about Wollstonecraft's promotion of sensibility, fellow feminist and author Mary Hays criticized the book's mawkishness. A professor of moral philosophy, Thomas Brown, published a poetic response to the book, The Wanderer in Norway (1816). Rather than rejoicing in the freedom that Wollstonecraft argued the connection between nature and emotion offered, however, Brown represented {{her work as a}} failure and Wollstonecraft as a tragic victim. He read the book as a cautionary tale, whereas Wollstonecraft had intended it as a description of the possibilities of social and personal reform. As Favret argues, almost all of <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark placed the narrator/Mary in the position of a sentimental heroine, while the text itself, with its fusion of sensibility and politics, actually does much to challenge that image.|$|E

For {{the first time in}} the Candidature phase, the official bid flag was raised during a ceremony held at the Palácio da Cidade (English: City's Palace) on June 23, 2008, celebrating the Olympic Day. On July 3, 2008, the Rio de Janeiro bid committee paid a fee of USD 500,000 to the IOC and signed the Candidature Procedure, reconfirming its acceptance of the rules. Then, Rio officials participated in the Olympic Games Observers Program from August 8 to 24, during the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China; and attended the IOC Official Debriefing of the Beijing Games from November 24 to 27, in London, United Kingdom. On February 11, 2009, the Rio de Janeiro bid committee delivered its Candidature File to the IOC in Lausanne and, eight days later, to the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) in Bonn, Germany; containing <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> the 2016 Candidature Procedure and Questionnaire, as well as guarantees and undertakings. The Candidature File had three volumes containing 568 pages of detailed answers to 300 technical questions, divided into 17 themes. Finally, on June 17, 2009, the IOC organized the 2016 Candidate Cities Briefing to 93 of its members at the Olympic Museum, being the first such meeting in its history and the most important before the election. Rio officials came out stronger after a presentation of 45 minutes, considered to be exceptional, followed by a session of 16 questions.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} locally {{administered}} physostigmine and di-isopropylphosphorofluoridate (DFP) were compared on <b>the</b> secretory <b>response</b> of sweat glands to intradermally injected acetylcholine and carbachol in healthy male volunteers (physostigmine: six subjects; DFP: one subject). <b>The</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> acetylcholine {{reached its peak}} within 10 s of injection and then rapidly declined, whereas <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> carbachol increased steadily reaching a peak between 5 and 7 min after injection. <b>The</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> acetylcholine was potentiated {{in the presence of}} both physostigmine and DFP, whilst <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> carbachol was not significantly affected by either of these drugs. The difference in <b>the</b> time-course of <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> acetylcholine and carbachol may be attributed to differences in the susceptibility of the two drugs to metabolism by acetylcholinesterase; carbachol, unlike acetylcholine, being virtually immune to metabolism by this enzyme. It is concluded that <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> carbachol is mediated by a direct stimulatory action on post-synaptic muscarinic receptors rather than by activation of pre-synaptic nicotinic receptors leading to the release of endogenous acetylcholine...|$|R

25|$|NOS3 {{variants}} {{may also}} affect <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> drugs that affect NO signaling, such as statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors (PDE5i). Statin treatment {{was more effective}} in increasing NO bioavailability in subjects carrying the CC genotype for the g.-786T>C polymorphism than in TT carriers. Hypertensive patients carrying the TC/CC genotypes and the C allele for the g.-786T>C polymorphism showed better antihypertensive responses to ACEi enalapril. Likewise, patients with erectile dysfunction carrying the C allele for g.-786T>C polymorphism showed better responses to PDE-5 inhibitor sildenafil. Together, these studies suggest that statins, ACEi and PDE-5 inhibitors may restore an impaired NO production in subjects carrying the variant allele/genotype for g.-786T>C NOS3 polymorphism, thus attenuating the cardiovascular risk. In addition to analysis of genetic polymorphisms individually, haplotypes including the SNPs g.-786T>C and Glu298Asp and the VNTR in intron 4 were showen to affect <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> sildenafil in patients with erectile dysfunction.|$|E

25|$|Among rice cultivars, {{there are}} {{differences}} in <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to,</b> and recovery from, pest damage. Many rice varieties have been selected for resistance to insect pests. Therefore, particular cultivars are recommended for areas prone to certain pest problems. The genetically based ability of a rice variety to withstand pest attacks is called resistance. Three main types of plant resistance to pests are recognized as nonpreference, antibiosis, and tolerance. Nonpreference (or antixenosis) describes host plants which insects prefer to avoid; antibiosis is where insect survival is reduced after the ingestion of host tissue; and tolerance is the capacity of a plant to produce high yield or retain high quality despite insect infestation.|$|E
25|$|Bird {{intelligence}} {{deals with}} the definition of intelligence and its measurement {{as it applies to}} birds. The difficulty of defining or measuring intelligence in non-human animals makes the subject difficult for scientific study. Anatomically, birds (the 10,000 species of which are the direct living descendants of, and so are, theropod dinosaurs) have relatively large brains compared to their head size. The visual and auditory senses are well developed in most species, while the tactile and olfactory senses are well realized only in a few groups. Birds communicate using visual signals as well as through the use of calls and song. The testing of intelligence is therefore based on studying <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> sensory stimuli.|$|E

40|$|Eleven healthy male volunteers {{participated in}} a study {{comparing}} the effects of locally and systemically administered cholinoceptor antagonists on <b>the</b> secretory <b>response</b> of sweat glands to intradermally injected carbachol chloride.

The nicotinic receptor antagonists hexamethonium bromide and (+) -tubocurarine chloride, however, {{had little effect on}} <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> carbachol. Atropine sulphate, administered systemically by intramuscular injection, caused a non-surmountable antagonism of <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> carbachol: <b>the</b> maximum of the dose-response curve was depressed with little change in the value of ED 50. Atropine methonitrate (a mixed muscarinic/nicotinic receptor antagonist), and hexamethonium bromide (a nicotinic receptor antagonist), both with poor access to the central nervous system, were injected intramuscularly: both caused non-surmountable antagonism of <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> carbachol. It is concluded that <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> carbachol is mediated by muscarinic rather than nicotinic receptors. The effect of atropine sulphate on <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> carbachol depends on the route of administration: while locally applied atropine sulphate appears to act as a competitive antagonist, systemically applied atropine sulphate, like atropine methonitrate and hexamethonium bromide, appears to act in a non-competitive manner. It is suggested that the systemically administered cholinoceptor antagonists reduce <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> carbachol by interacting with cholinoceptors in sympathetic ganglia: such an interaction would reduce the impulse flow in sudomotor fibres resulting in decreased sensitivity of the sweat glands to carbachol...|$|R
25|$|The {{immunochemistry}} of Triticeae glutens {{is important}} in several inflammatory diseases.

The response is also dependent on the genetic makeup of the human leukocyte antigen genes. In gluten sensitive enteropathy, there are 4 types of recognition, innate immunity (a form of cellular immunity priming), HLA-DQ, and antibody recognition of gliadin and transglutaminase. With idiopathic gluten sensitivity only antibody recognition to gliadin has been resolved. In wheat allergy, the response pathways are mediated through IgE against other wheat proteins and other forms of gliadin.|$|E
