5|$|Though fibrofolliculomas {{are unique}} to Birt–Hogg–Dubé, they may present with an {{ambiguous}} appearance and must be confirmed histologically. Other diseases can mimic the dermatologic manifestations of BHD, including <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis</b> complex, Cowden syndrome, familial trichoepitheliomas, and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. <b>Tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis</b> must be distinguished because both disorders can present with angiofibromas on the face, though they are more common in <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Advocates for {{the diet}} {{recommend}} {{that it be}} seriously considered after two medications have failed, as the chance of other drugs succeeding is only 10%. The diet can be considered earlier for some epilepsy and genetic syndromes where it has shown particular usefulness. These include Dravet syndrome, infantile spasms, myoclonic-astatic epilepsy and <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis</b> complex.|$|E
5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} can manifest {{similarly to}} other diseases, {{which must be}} ruled out when making a diagnosis. These include <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis,</b> which causes skin lesions similar to fibrofolliculomas, and Von Hippel-Lindau disease, which causes hereditary kidney cancers. Once diagnosed, people with BHD are treated preventatively, with monitoring of kidneys and lungs using medical imaging. Fibrofolliculomas can be removed surgically and pneumothorax and kidney cancer are treated according to the normal standard of care.|$|E
5|$|Children who {{discontinue}} {{the diet}} after achieving seizure freedom {{have about a}} 20% risk of seizures returning. The length of time until recurrence is highly variable but averages two years. This risk of recurrence compares with 10% for resective surgery (where {{part of the brain}} is removed) and 30–50% for anticonvulsant therapy. Of those that have a recurrence, just over half can regain freedom from seizures either with anticonvulsants or by returning to the ketogenic diet. Recurrence is more likely if, despite seizure freedom, an electroencephalogram (EEG) shows epileptiform spikes, which indicate epileptic activity in the brain but are below the level that will cause a seizure. Recurrence is also likely if an MRI scan shows focal abnormalities (for example, as in children with <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis).</b> Such children may remain on the diet longer than average, and {{it has been suggested that}} children with <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis</b> who achieve seizure freedom could remain on the ketogenic diet indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Hereditary {{recurrent}} pneumothorax or pulmonary cysts {{are associated}} with Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, <b>Tuberous</b> <b>Sclerosis</b> Complex (TSC), alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, and cystic fibrosis. Non-hereditary recurrent pneumothorax and/or pulmonary cysts can occur with Langerhans cell histiocytosis and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. These conditions are differentiated from Birt–Hogg–Dubé through examining the patient history and performing a physical examination. In women suspected to have the disease, ruling out pulmonary or thoracic endometriosis may be necessary.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis</b> (TSC) {{research}} spans less than 200 years. TSC is a rare, multi-system genetic disease {{that can cause}} benign tumours to grow on the brain or other vital organs such as the kidneys, heart, eyes, lungs, and skin. A combination of symptoms may include seizures, developmental delay, behavioural problems and skin abnormalities, as well as lung and kidney disease. TSC is caused by mutations on either of two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, which encode for the proteins hamartin and tuberin respectively. These proteins act as tumour growth suppressors and regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. Originally regarded as a rare pathological curiosity, it is now an important focus of research into tumour formation and suppression.|$|E
5|$|FLCN {{creates a}} protein called folliculin that has two isoforms. It appears {{to act as}} a tumor {{suppressor}} and is expressed strongly in the skin, distal nephrons, and type I pneumocytes. It has also been found in the parotid gland, brain, breast, pancreas, prostate, and ovaries. Tumor suppressors normally prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Mutations in the FLCN gene may interfere with the ability of folliculin to restrain cell growth and division, leading to the formation of noncancerous and cancerous tumors. Recent studies suggest that folliculin accomplishes this function through its involvement with cellular metabolism, possibly through modulation of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway and/or oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Folliculin interacts with FNIP1 and FNIP2 (FLCN-interacting protein) to form a complex with AMP-activated protein kinase. Folliculin's participation in the mTOR pathway may explain the similarity in phenotype between BHD syndrome, Cowden syndrome, <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis,</b> and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Other tumors {{can include}} trichodiscomas (tumors {{of the hair}} disc, which may be {{identical}} to fibrofolliculomas), angiofibromas, and perifollicular fibromas. However, angiofibromas are more common in <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis.</b> Along with the tumors, other skin conditions are seen in people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. Approximately 40% of people or families with the disease have papules in their mouth, which can be located on the cheeks (buccal mucosa), tongue, gums, or lips. Either white or mucosa-colored, they are discrete, small, and soft and consist of fibrous tissue covered in thickened epithelium. Collagenomas of the skin are also found in some families. Many people with BHD have skin lesions {{that appear to be}} acrochordons (skin tags), but may instead be fibrofolliculomas. These lesions are usually found in the armpit, on the eyelids, and in folds of skin. Not all individuals develop the facial tumors; some families with the mutation that causes BHD develop only kidney tumors or spontaneous pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|Secondary {{causes of}} tics (not related to {{inherited}} Tourette syndrome) are {{commonly referred to}} as tourettism. Dystonias, choreas, other genetic conditions, and secondary causes of tics should be ruled out in the differential diagnosis for Tourette syndrome. Other conditions that may manifest tics or stereotyped movements include developmental disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and stereotypic movement disorder; Sydenham's chorea; idiopathic dystonia; and genetic conditions such as Huntington's disease, neuroacanthocytosis, Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Wilson's disease, and <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis.</b> Other possibilities include chromosomal disorders such as Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, XYY syndrome and fragile X syndrome. Acquired causes of tics include drug-induced tics, head trauma, encephalitis, stroke, and carbon monoxide poisoning. The symptoms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome may also be confused with Tourette syndrome. Most of these conditions are rarer than tic disorders, and a thorough history and examination may be enough to rule them out, without medical or screening tests.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{epilepsy}} following meningitis is {{less than}} 10%; that disease more commonly causes seizures during the infection itself. In herpes simplex encephalitis {{the risk of a}} seizure is around 50% with a high risk of epilepsy following (up to 25%). Infection with the pork tapeworm, which can result in neurocysticercosis, is the cause of up to half of epilepsy cases in areas of the world where the parasite is common. Epilepsy may also occur after other brain infections such as cerebral malaria, toxoplasmosis, and toxocariasis. Chronic alcohol use increases the risk of epilepsy: those who drink six units of alcohol per day have a two and a half fold increase in risk. Other risks include Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis,</b> and autoimmune encephalitis. Getting vaccinated does not increase the risk of epilepsy. Malnutrition is a risk factor seen mostly in the developing world, although it is unclear however if it is a direct cause or an association. People with cerebral palsy have an increased risk of epilepsy, with half of people with spastic quadriplegia and spastic hemiplegia having the disease.|$|E
25|$|HMB-45 is nonreactive {{with almost}} all non-melanoma human malignancies, with the {{exception}} of rare tumors showing evidence of melanogenesis (e.g., pigmented schwannoma, clear cell sarcoma) or tumors associated with <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis</b> complex (angiomyolipoma and lymphangiomyoma).|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type of LGS (70–78%) is {{symptomatic}} (secondary) - that is an identifiable underlying pathology is responsible. This includes encephalopathy (brain damage) or another disease and/or developmental disorder. Frequent causes include <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis,</b> hereditary metabolic diseases, inflammatory brain disease such as encephalitis, meningitis, and toxoplasmosis; hypoxia–ischemia injury and other birth injuries; and lesions of the frontal lobe. These patients tend to have a worse prognosis than those with idiopathic (unknown cause) LGS.|$|E
25|$|On May 28, 2015, the FDA {{approved}} sirolimus {{to treat}} lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a rare, progressive lung disease that primarily affects {{women of childbearing}} age. This made sirolimus the first drug approved to treat this disease. LAM involves lung tissue infiltration with smooth muscle-like cells with mutations of the <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis</b> complex gene (TSC2). Loss of TSC2 gene function activates the mTOR signaling pathway, resulting in the release of lymphangiogenic growth factors. Sirolimus blocks this pathway.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis</b> complex (TSC) {{is a rare}} multisystem {{genetic disease}} that causes benign tumors {{to grow in the}} brain and on other vital organs such as the kidneys, heart, liver, eyes, lungs, and skin. A {{combination}} of symptoms may include seizures, intellectual disability, developmental delay, behavioral problems, skin abnormalities, and lung and kidney disease. TSC is caused by a mutation of either of two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, which code for the proteins hamartin and tuberin, respectively. These proteins act as tumor growth suppressors, agents that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation.|$|E
25|$|Sirolimus {{also shows}} promise in {{treating}} <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis</b> complex (TSC), a congenital disorder that leaves sufferers prone to benign tumor {{growth in the}} brain, heart, kidneys, skin, and other organs. After several studies conclusively linked mTOR inhibitors to remission in TSC tumors, specifically subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas in children and angiomyolipomas in adults, many US doctors began prescribing sirolimus (Wyeth's Rapamune) and everolimus (Novartis's RAD001) to TSC patients off-label. Numerous clinical trials using both rapamycin analogs, involving both children and adults with TSC, are underway in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Nitrazepam is not {{recommended}} for use in those under 18 years of age. Use in very young children may be especially dangerous. Children treated with nitrazepam for epilepsies may develop tolerance within months of continued use, with dose escalation often occurring with prolonged use. Sleepiness, deterioration in motor skills and ataxia were common side effects in children with <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis</b> treated with nitrazepam. The side effects of nitrazepam may impair the development of motor and cognitive skills in children treated with nitrazepam. Withdrawal only occasionally resulted in a return of seizures and some children withdrawn from nitrazepam appeared to improve. Development, for example the ability to walk at five years of age, was impaired in many children taking nitrazepam, but was not impaired with several other nonbenzodiazepine antiepileptic agents. Children being treated with nitrazepam have been recommended to be reviewed and have their nitrazepam gradually discontinued whenever appropriate. Excess sedation, hypersalivation, swallowing difficulty, and high incidence of aspiration pneumonia, {{as well as several}} deaths, have been associated with nitrazepam therapy in children.|$|E

500|$|... 1864: German {{pathologist}} Rudolf Virchow {{published a}} three-volume work on tumours that described {{a child with}} cerebral <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis</b> and rhabdomyoma of the heart.

500|$|... 1942: Sylvan E. Moolten {{proposed}} [...] "the <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis</b> complex", {{which is}} now the preferred name. This recognises the multi-organ nature of the disease. Moolten introduced three words to describe its pathology: [...] "the basic lesion is hamartial, becoming in turn tumor-like (hamartoma) or truly neoplastic (hamartoblastoma)." ...|$|E
500|$|... 1835: French {{dermatologist}} Pierre François Olive Rayer {{published an}} atlas of skin diseases. It contains 22 large coloured plates with 400 figures {{presented in a}} systematic order. On page 20, fig. 1 is a drawing that {{is regarded as the}} earliest description of <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis.</b> Entitled [...] "végétations vasculaires", Rayer noted these were [...] "small vascular, of papulous appearance, widespread growths distributed on the nose and around the mouth". No mention was made of any medical condition associated with the skin disorder.|$|E
500|$|... 1862: German {{physician}} Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen, who {{was working}} {{as an assistant to}} Rudolf Virchow in the Institute for Pathological Anatomy in Berlin, presented a case to the city's Obstetrical Society. The heart of an infant who [...] "died after taking a few breaths" [...] had several tumours. He called these tumours [...] "myomata", one of which was the [...] "size of a pigeon's egg". He also noted the brain had [...] "a great number of scleroses". These were almost certainly the cardiac rhabdomyomas and cortical tubers of <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis.</b> He failed to recognise a distinct disease, regarding it as a pathological-anatomical curiosity. Von Recklinghausen's name would instead become associated with neurofibromatosis after a classic paper in 1881.|$|E
2500|$|Uncommon {{risk factors}} include genetic {{disorders}} such as neurofibromatosis, Li–Fraumeni syndrome, <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis,</b> or Turcot syndrome. Previous radiation therapy is also a risk. For unknown reasons, GBM occurs more commonly in males.|$|E
2500|$|Wood's lamp {{is useful}} in {{diagnosing}} conditions such as <b>tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis</b> and erythrasma (caused by 'Corynebacterium minutissimum', see above). [...] Additionally, detection of porphyria cutanea tarda can sometimes be made when urine turns pink upon illumination with Wood's lamp. Wood's lamps have also been used to differentiate hypopigmentation from depigmentation such as with vitiligo. A vitiligo patient's skin will appear yellow-green or blue under the Wood's lamp. Its use in detecting melanoma has been reported.|$|E
2500|$|Only one mutated copy of {{the gene}} will be {{necessary}} {{for a person to}} be affected by an autosomal dominant disorder. Each affected person usually has one affected parent. [...] The chance a child will inherit the mutated gene is 50%. [...] Autosomal dominant conditions sometimes have reduced penetrance, which means although only one mutated copy is needed, not all individuals who inherit that mutation go on to develop the disease. [...] Examples of this type of disorder are Huntington's disease, [...] neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2, Marfan syndrome, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, hereditary multiple exostoses (a highly penetrant autosomal dominant disorder), <b>Tuberous</b> <b>sclerosis,</b> Von Willebrand disease, and acute intermittent porphyria. Birth defects are also called congenital anomalies.|$|E
2500|$|Dystonias, {{paroxysmal}} dyskinesias, chorea, other genetic conditions, {{and secondary}} causes of tics should {{be ruled out}} in the differential diagnosis.

2500|$|In 1998 the Silva {{laboratory}} {{moved to}} the Department of Neurobiology at the UCLA School of Medicine. There, the laboratory [...] bridged their growing involvement in animal models of cognitive disorders with clinical studies. Additionally, UCLA's large and highly collaborative neuroscience community was an ideal environment for the interdisciplinary studies that characterized work in the Silva laboratory. [...] The Silva laboratory became more involved in studying molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for cognitive deficits in genetic neurodevelopmental disorders. In the late nineties, cognitive deficits associated with this class of disorders {{were thought to be}} caused by genetic disruptions of brain development [...] Animal model studies of Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) in the Silva lab suggested that the learning and memory deficits associated with NF1 mutations are caused by changes in synaptic plasticity mechanisms in adults. Accordingly, a project led by Rui M. Costa in the Silva Lab demonstrated that the electrophysiological, and more importantly the behavioral deficits, caused by NF1 mutations could be reversed in adults by manipulations that corrected the molecular signaling deficits associated with these mutations. This discovery, and a series of later studies in many laboratories worldwide, have demonstrated the surprising efficacy of adult interventions in reversing cognitive phenotypes in animal models of neurodevelopmental disorders. Following the NF1 studies published in 2002 by the Silva laboratory, other findings that reported adult rescue of neurodevelopment disorders include, for example, animal studies of Lhermitte-Duclos disease [...] and Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome in 2003, Fragile X syndrome in 2005, Down syndrome in 2007, Rett syndrome [...] and Angelman syndrome in 2007, <b>Tuberous</b> <b>Sclerosis</b> in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Weidong Li and Steven Kushner led {{a team in}} the Silva lab that {{developed}} a treatment for the cognitive deficits associated with an animal model of [...] Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1). They discovered that Lovastatin, a statin that crosses the blood-brain barrier, at a dose that does not affect control mice, rescues the Ras/MAPK signaling, synaptic plasticity and behavioral deficits of mice with a NF1 mutation. Statins decrease the levels of isoprenyls, lipid groups that are required for the isoprenylation and activity of Ras, a signaling molecule normally regulated by the protein encoded by the NF1 gene. The work in the Silva lab showed that the NF1 mutation leads to increases in the levels of active Ras in the brain, and that statins reverse this increase without affecting Ras signaling in controls. These results {{have led to a}} number of small promising, but inconclusive, clinical trials, and to two large on going clinical studies in the USA and Europe. A team led by Dan Ehninger in the Silva lab also showed that rapamycin, an FDA approved inhibitor of mTOR, can reverse the late-LTP deficits and learning impairments they discovered in an animal model of <b>Tuberous</b> <b>Sclerosis</b> (Tsc2 heterozygous mice). Interestingly, TSC is highly associated with autism, but the Tsc2 heterozygous mice did not show any autism-like behavioral abnormalities, such as social interaction deficits. Artificially activating the immune system of pregnant mice, however, does reveal social interaction deficits in [...] Tsc2 heterozygous progeny, suggesting that the autism-like symptoms in TSC require not only Tsc mutations, but also another factor, such as immune activation during pregnancy. Importantly, analyses of human TSC data suggested a similar interaction between the TSC mutation and immuno-activation during pregnancy. Recently, Miou Zhou and colleagues at the Silva lab found that rapamycin is also capable of both preventing and reversing behavioral deficits caused by mutation of a schizophrenia-causing gene (DISC 1) in neurons that are born and develop in adult mice (i.e., adult neurogenesis). Surprisingly, rapamycin reverses behavioral deficits despite its inability to reverse structural deficits discovered in neurons with Disc 1 knock down. All together, these findings make a compelling case that adult treatments may be effective at reversing behavioral cognitive and psychiatric symptoms associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as NF1, TSC and Schizophrenia.|$|E
