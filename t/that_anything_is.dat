25|$|When Poirot first {{arrives at}} the Chevenix-Gore's house, he meets Chevenix's wife Vanda, an {{eccentric}} who believes she is a reincarnation of an Egyptian woman, his adopted daughter Ruth and her cousin Hugo, and Miss Lingard, a secretary helping Chevenix research a family history. It is revealed that before Poirot arrives, all the guests and family were dressing for dinner, and after they heard the dinner gong, a shot rang out. No one suspected <b>that</b> <b>anything</b> <b>is</b> wrong, believing that either a car had backfired or champagne was being served. And Chevenix-Gore not being {{the most popular of}} men, {{there are any number of}} suspects, including his own daughter and nephew. It is revealed that Hugo is engaged to Susan (another guest at the house) and Ruth has already married Lake (Chevenix-Gore's agent) in secret.|$|E

500|$|The 2012 Summer Games marked Sherab Zam's Olympic debut. She was {{the flag}} bearer {{at both the}} opening and closing ceremonies. She {{qualified}} for the individual archery competition after receiving a wildcard from the Tripartite Commission. In an interview with Reuters before the games Zam said that [...] "Participation {{is more important than}} winning a medal." [...] Zam spent time in South Korea and India preparing for the games. The archery events at the 2012 games were held at the Lord's Cricket Ground. Zam competed on 27 July in the ranking round, finishing 61st out of 64 competitors with 589 points. She scored 82 points less than the leading competitor, Ki Bo-bae of South Korea. Zam competed against American Khatuna Lorig, the fourth ranking athlete in the ranking round, in the round of 64. Lorig beat Zam three sets to none in about six minutes. This meant Zam was eliminated from the competition. After the games Zam said: [...] "I am not that good at archery but I love it. It was so good to meet world ranking archers who are famous and to watch how they do it. I have learnt a lot from them," [...] and that, [...] "When I grew up I never dreamt I would come to London, let alone compete in an Olympics. This just shows <b>that</b> <b>anything</b> <b>is</b> possible. The Olympics is great for that." ...|$|E

25|$|Finally, in lightly used {{wilderness}} areas, {{it is best}} {{to replace}} <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> moved while preparing the fire site, and scatter <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> gathered, so that it looks as natural as possible.

Williams was inspired by Winters's ingenuity, realizing, he said, [...] "that anything is possible, <b>that</b> <b>anything</b> <b>is</b> funny He gave me {{the idea that it}} can be free-form, that you can go in and out of things pretty easily." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hypomania {{may feel}} good to some persons who {{experience}} it, though most people who experience hypomania state that {{the stress of the}} experience is very painful. Bipolar people who experience hypomania, however, tend to forget the effects of their actions on those around them. Even when family and friends recognize mood swings, the individual will often deny <b>that</b> <b>anything</b> <b>is</b> wrong. What might be called a [...] "hypomanic event", if not accompanied by depressive episodes, is often not deemed problematic, unless the mood changes are uncontrollable, volatile, or mercurial. Most commonly, symptoms continue for a few weeks to a few months.|$|E
2500|$|... ust {{as in the}} {{sciences}} {{we have learned that}} we are too ignorant to safely pronounce anything impossible, so for the individual, since we cannot know just what are his limitations, we can hardly say with certainty <b>that</b> <b>anything</b> <b>is</b> necessarily within or beyond his grasp. Each must remember that no one can predict to what heights of wealth, fame, or usefulness he may rise until he has honestly endeavored, and he should derive courage from the fact that all sciences have been, at some time, in the same condition as he, and that it has often proved true that the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow.|$|E

2500|$|Mereology {{has been}} {{explored}} {{in various ways}} as applications of predicate logic to formal ontology, in each of which mereology is an important part. Each of these fields provides its own axiomatic definition of mereology. A common element of such axiomatizations is the assumption, shared with inclusion, that the part-whole relation orders its universe, meaning that everything {{is a part of}} itself (reflexivity), that a part of a part of a whole is itself a part of that whole (transitivity), and that two distinct entities cannot each {{be a part of the}} other (antisymmetry), thus forming a poset. [...] A variant of this axiomatization denies <b>that</b> <b>anything</b> <b>is</b> ever part of itself (irreflexivity) while accepting transitivity, from which antisymmetry follows automatically.|$|E
2500|$|In Buddhism, dukkha {{is one of}} {{the three}} marks of existence, along with impermanence and anattā (non-self). Buddhism, like other major Indian religions, asserts that {{everything}} is impermanent (anicca), but, unlike them, also asserts that there is no permanent self or soul in living beings (anattā). Gombrich (2006), page 47, Quote: [...] "(...) Buddha's teaching that beings have no soul, no abiding essence. This 'no-soul doctrine' (anatta-vada) he expounded in his second sermon." [...] Steven Collins (1994), Religion and Practical Reason (Editors: Frank Reynolds, David Tracy), State Univ of New York Press, , page 64; [...] "Central to Buddhist soteriology is the doctrine of not-self (Pali: anattā, Sanskrit: anātman, the opposed doctrine of ātman is central to Brahmanical thought). Put very briefly, this is the [...] doctrine that human beings have no soul, no self, no unchanging essence."; John C. Plott et al (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 63, Quote: [...] "The Buddhist schools reject any Ātman concept. As we have already observed, this is the basic and ineradicable distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism"; Katie Javanaud (2013), , Philosophy Now; David Loy (1982), Enlightenment in Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta: Are Nirvana and Moksha the Same?, International Philosophical Quarterly, Volume 23, Issue 1, pages 65–74 The ignorance or misperception (avijjā) <b>that</b> <b>anything</b> <b>is</b> permanent or that there is self in any being is considered a wrong understanding, and the primary source of clinging and dukkha.|$|E
