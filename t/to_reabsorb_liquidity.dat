40|$|THE KIDNEYS FILTER 120 ml/min at the renal glomeruli, and {{two thirds}} of this ultrafiltrate is reabsorbed in the {{proximal}} tubule. To accomplish this high rate of reabsorption, the proximal tubule has a tall brush border formed by densely packed microvilli each with a core of actin filaments bundled with cytoskeletal proteins (Fig. 1) (6). This microvillar specializa-tion is estimated to increase the surface area of the cell 30 -fold (10). Transporters in the apical microvilli include the Na/H exchanger isoform 3 (NHE 3) and anion transporters <b>to</b> <b>reabsorb</b> most of the sodium chloride and bicarbonate, the Na-phosphate cotransporter 2 (NaPi 2) <b>to</b> <b>reabsorb</b> phosphate, Na-glucose and Na-amino acid transporters <b>to</b> <b>reabsorb</b> substrates, and water channels (aquaporin- 1) <b>to</b> <b>reabsorb</b> water.

30|$|Though easily available, {{interpretation}} of preterm urinary sodium loss is difficult, {{as a high}} fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) could signify excess supplementation in functioning tubules, or inability <b>to</b> <b>reabsorb</b> sodium in tubulopathy.

50|$|Renal {{compensation}} for metabolic alkalosis, less effective than respiratory compensation, consists of increased excretion of HCO3− (bicarbonate), as the filtered load of HCO3− exceeds {{the ability of}} the renal tubule <b>to</b> <b>reabsorb</b> it.|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the site of}} bicarbonate reabsorption, tubular fragments from five different segments of the salamander nephron (Ambystoma) were perfused in vitro. Bicarbonate contents (total CO 2) of tubular fluid were determined by microcalorimetry. Bicarbonate was not transported by the diluting segment or the mid-distal tubule. Although proximal tubule fragments did appear <b>to</b> <b>reabsorb</b> bicarbonate (10. 8 +/- 3. 7 pmol X mm- 1 X min- 1, P less than 0. 01, n = 14), the chemical gradients observed were small {{with respect to the}} sensitivity of our methods. In the late distal tubule (LDT), bicarbonate reabsorption averaged 28. 9 +/- 8. 2 pmol X mm- 1 X min- 1 (P less than 0. 01, n = 16). Transport in this segment was inhibited by ethoxzolamide or by perfusing with a sodium-free solution. Ethoxzolamide had no effect on the trans-epithelial voltage. Thus bicarbonate is reabsorbed by the LDT of amphibia via a mechanism that is dependent on carbonic anhydrase and the presence of luminal sodium. The 13 initial collecting tubules (ICT) studied did not appear <b>to</b> <b>reabsorb</b> bicarbonate. On the other hand, some ICT developed substantial bicarbonate gradients. Therefore this nephron segment has the capacity <b>to</b> <b>reabsorb</b> bicarbonate...|$|R

50|$|Cystinuria {{is caused}} by {{mutations}} in the SLC3A1 and SLC7A9 genes. These defects prevent proper reabsorption of basic, or positively charged, amino acids: Cystine, lysine, ornithine, arginine. Under normal circumstances, this protein allows certain amino acids, including cystine, <b>to</b> be <b>reabsorbed</b> into the blood from the filtered fluid that will become urine. Mutations in either of these genes disrupt the ability of this transporter protein <b>to</b> <b>reabsorb</b> these amino acids, allowing them to become concentrated in the urine. As the levels of cystine in the urine increase, the crystals typical of cystinuria are able to form, resulting in kidney stones. Cystine crystals form hexagonal-shaped crystals that can be viewed upon microscopic analysis of the urine. The other amino acids that are not reabsorbed do not create crystals in urine.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the course}} of the first novel it becomes {{apparent}} that Ukiah is, in fact, not human—or at least not completely human. When he is severely injured his blood forms into independently operating animals: larger clots form [...] "blood mice," [...] smaller clots might form insects or other animals of appropriate size. This is a defense mechanism that allows cells to live independently if the main body is injured. These animals contain some of his memories, and they will subsequently try to rejoin him <b>to</b> be <b>reabsorbed</b> by his body; failure <b>to</b> <b>reabsorb</b> such a [...] "blood animal" [...] results in the loss of that memory. Ukiah can even be killed, but as long as his body is not destroyed (e.g. by burning) he will recover given sufficient time.|$|R
2500|$|Vasopressin {{regulates the}} [...] tonicity of body fluids. It is {{released}} from the posterior pituitary in response to hypertonicity and causes the kidneys <b>to</b> <b>reabsorb</b> solute-free water {{and return it to}} the circulation from the tubules of the nephron, thus returning the tonicity of the body fluids toward normal. An incidental consequence of this renal reabsorption of water is concentrated urine and reduced urine volume. AVP released in high concentrations may also raise blood pressure by inducing moderate vasoconstriction.|$|R
50|$|A {{human being}} usually has four {{parathyroid}} glands {{located on the}} back surface of the thyroid in the neck.

When a parathyroid adenoma causes hyperparathyroidism, more parathyroid hormone is secreted, causing the calcium concentration of the blood to rise, resulting in hypercalcemia.|$|R

Glycosuria leads to excessive water loss into the urine with resultant dehydration, a process called osmotic diuresis.|$|R
