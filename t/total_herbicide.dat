Herbicides {{should be used to}} their greatest potential by ensuring that the timing, dose, application method, soil and climatic conditions are optimal for good activity. In the UK, partially resistant grass weeds such as Alopecurus myosuroides (blackgrass) and Avena spp. (wild oat) can often be controlled adequately when herbicides are applied at the 2-3 leaf stage, whereas later applications at the 2-3 tiller stage can fail badly.

In addition, Graham Brookes of PG Economics accused Benbrook of making subjective estimates of herbicide use because the data provided by the National Agricultural Statistics Service doesn't distinguish between genetically modified and non-genetically modified crops.

30|$|Few {{comprehensive}} estimates {{have been}} made of the impacts of HR crops on herbicide use. The USDA has not issued a new estimate in well over a decade; the USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) reported an 3.7 million kg (8.2 million pound) decrease in pesticide use in 1998 as a result of GE corn, soybeans, and cotton [7], an estimate that is comparable to the present study’s estimate of a 4.4 million kg (9.6 million pound) reduction [Additional file 1 : Table S 15]. A series of unpublished simulation studies have been carried out by the National Center for Food and Agriculture Policy (NCFAP). In a report covering crop year 2005, NCFAP projected that HR corn, soybean, and cotton reduced <b>total</b> <b>herbicide</b> use by 25.6 million kgs, compared to hectares planted to non-HR varieties [6]. Sankula’s herbicide use estimates are based on observations of mostly university experts regarding “typical” herbicide use rates on farms planting HR versus non-HR varieties. The rates incorporated in Sankula’s estimates often differ from those published for the same year by USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) [8]. NASS reported that an average 1.5 applications of glyphosate were made on HR soybeans in 2005, while Sankula assumes only 1.18 applications. Sankula’s estimate of <b>total</b> <b>herbicide</b> use on RR soybeans in 2005, 1.15 kgs/ha (1.03 pounds/acre), is less than the NASS figure for glyphosate alone, 1.23 kgs/ha (1.1 pounds/acre).

Sethoxydim is a herbicide used to control monocot species, {{and can be used}} as a postemergence-directed treatment in corn to control grassy weeds. The corn growth and yield model CERES-Maize (V 1. 0) was modified to respond to herbicide induced grain yield reductions by incorporating a herbicide stress factor and the duration of this stress into calculation of the daily biomass production. The modified version of CERES-Maize was calibrated with field data from 1988 and was tested with independent field data from 1989. The results of the field research indicated that sethoxydim reduced net photosynthesis of four corn hybrids for 10 to 30 days. This reduction in net photosynthesis could be detected within one day after sethoxydim was applied. Herbicide stress was defined as the difference in net photosynthesis between sethoxydim treated and non-treated plants. <b>Total</b> <b>herbicide</b> stress was defined as stress intensity (percent reduction in net photosynthesis) times the duration of the stress. <b>Total</b> <b>herbicide</b> stress was highly correlated with grain yield.

In contrast, exposure to certain fungicides can decrease Bd abundance on frog skin. We examined the relationships between the abundance of Bd on the skin of individual Boreal Chorus Frogs (Pseudacris maculata) and the concentrations of pesticides in the water and in frog tissue at six agriculturally dominated wetlands in Iowa, USA. We collected frogs from each wetland, swabbed them for Bd, and analyzed their tissues for a suite of fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides. We collected surface water from the wetlands and we analyzed it for the same suite of pesticides.

Wheat cultivar Enola was planted at norm 550 germinating 140 120 80 2 seeds/m. The number of emerging wheat plants was read using square sampling frames sized 50 cm x 50 cm. Using the same sampling frames, the tillering in autumn prior to the wintering of the crops was followed, and in spring – prior to booting stage. The number of productive tillers was also read using these sampling frames. To determine the length of spike, the number of grains in it, and their weight, 30 spikes from 8 replications of each variant were analyzed. The emerging of the wheat plants, under the conditions of slightly leached chernozem soil in Dobrudzha region, was more uniform after sowing following disking, and after direct sowing. The minimal pre-sowing tillage and no-tillage for wheat ensured better autumn development of the crop and the plants. In these variants, higher number of overwintering plants and productive tillers per unit area were registered. Spike length was the highest after ploughing as pre-sowing tillage.

Next, we study adoption rates and gains or losses of farmers (adopters and non adopters) and upstream companies (sellers of conventional herbicides, of the <b>total</b> <b>herbicide</b> to which GM rapeseed is tolerant, of GM seed), depending on the GM seed license price, the margin rate on herbicide sales and the price of conventional herbicides. genetically modified organisms, innovation, diffusion, rapeseed, Consumer/Household Economics,...|$|E
40|$|More-effective {{weed control}} in {{agricultural}} fields {{can be achieved}} by utilizing information about the spatial distribution of the previous year’s mature weeds. In our study, variable-rate herbicide applications based on weed infestation maps developed just before the previous year’s harvest provided effective weed control. The results showed that when information about the spatial distribution of the previous year’s weed seedlings or mature weeds was used, weed control was comparable to uniform, one-rate, herbicide applications, while the <b>total</b> amount of <b>herbicide</b> applied decreased. Herbicide use was reduced an estimated 39 % for the seedling map and 24 % for the mature map approach. However, incorporating the weed-seed redistribution from harvest to application time into the treatment maps could further improve weed control...|$|R

Managed realignment involves the landward relocation of the seawall, allowing an area of agricultural land to be tidally inundated. It is believed that managed realignment sites can act as a sink for contaminants. However, these sites may also act as a contaminant source and pose a risk to estuarine biota. In this thesis, the potential for metal and herbicide release from agricultural soil and dredged sediment in managed realignment sites was investigated by laboratory microcosm experiments. The agricultural soil and dredged sediment were subjected to two different salinities and drying-rewetting treatments. Results indicate the release of metals (Cu, Ni and Zn) and herbicides (simazine, atrazine and diuron) was dependent on their strength of binding to the soil and sediment, and complexation and competition reactions between seawater anions, cations and the sorbed metals. The release patterns indicated that metal and herbicide release into overlying water may continue for extended periods of time after an initial rapid release. The <b>total</b> metal and <b>herbicide</b> loads released into the overlying water followed the order: Cu < Zn < Ni and diuron < atrazine < simazine with a greater release from the soil than sediment. The increase in CO 2 release, mineralisation rates, <b>total</b> metal and <b>herbicide</b> loads after drying and rewetting the soil suggested an increase in the mineralisation of organic matter and the release of organic matter associated metals and herbicides. Results of linear regression analyses provided evidence that the release of the metals and herbicides as DOC-complexes was important for soil but not for sediment. These findings indicate that there is a lower potential for contaminant release from managed realignment sites where dredged sediments are beneficially re-used...|$|R
