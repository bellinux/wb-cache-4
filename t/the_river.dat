5|$|Bateman was {{referring}} to Longdendale, and the upper valley of <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Etherow. The {{western side of the}} Peak District is drained by the Etherow, Goyt, and Tame which are tributaries of <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Mersey. The north east is drained by tributaries of <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Don. Of the tributaries of <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Trent, that drain the south and east, <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Derwent is the most prominent. It rises on Bleaklow just east of Glossop and flows through the Upper Derwent Valley where it is constrained by the Howden, Derwent and Ladybower Reservoirs. <b>The</b> <b>River</b> Noe and <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Wye are its tributaries. <b>The</b> <b>River</b> Manifold and River Dove, in the south west whose sources are on Axe Edge Moor flow into the Trent, while <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Dane flows into <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Weaver.|$|E
5|$|Beavers {{can also}} be found along <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> {{building}} small dams along <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> Night herons, ducks, and other birds are also present along <b>the</b> <b>river.</b>|$|E
5|$|More {{fish have}} been {{discovered}} in the newly daylighted section of <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> Baby eastern blacknose dace and tessellated darter have been spotted in <b>the</b> <b>river</b> in addition to trout. In addition, wood frogs, eastern painted turtles, and redbreast sunfish live in <b>the</b> <b>river</b> too. All of these species have been hurt by the industrialization of <b>the</b> <b>river.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{principal}} <b>rivers</b> in <b>the</b> district are <b>the</b> Muda <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Mecuzi <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Nhamatanda <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Tsengudza <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Nhamissenguere Metuchira <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Mecuzi Manguena <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Mítua <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Mussicavo <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Mutarara <b>River,</b> and <b>the</b> Pungwe <b>River.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{district}} {{belongs to}} the drainage basin of the Zambezi. <b>The</b> major <b>rivers</b> in <b>the</b> district are <b>the</b> Calidzipiri <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Lhangue <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Chiritse <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Namanzi <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> M'phonfi <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Modzi <b>River,</b> and <b>the</b> Mavudzi <b>River.</b>|$|R
50|$|Two of the Ontario tributaries of this <b>river</b> are <b>the</b> Garden <b>River</b> and <b>the</b> Bar <b>River.</b> Other Canadian tributaries include Fort Creek, <b>the</b> Root <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Little Carp <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Big Carp <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Lower Echo <b>River,</b> Desbarats <b>River,</b> and <b>the</b> Two Tree <b>River.</b> <b>The</b> American tributaries to <b>the</b> St. Mary <b>River</b> are <b>the</b> Gogomain <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Munuscong <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Little Munuscong <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Charlotte <b>River,</b> and <b>the</b> Waiska <b>River.</b>|$|R
5|$|Plymouth {{lies between}} <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Plym {{to the east}} and <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Tamar to the west; both rivers flow into the natural harbour of Plymouth Sound. Since 1967, the unitary {{authority}} of Plymouth has included the, once independent, towns of Plympton and Plymstock which lie along the east of <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Plym. <b>The</b> <b>River</b> Tamar forms the county boundary between Devon and Cornwall and its estuary forms the Hamoaze on which is sited Devonport Dockyard.|$|E
5|$|Shrewsbury, being {{almost entirely}} encircled by <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Severn, has nine bridges across <b>the</b> <b>river</b> and many that cross the Rea Brook.|$|E
5|$|The Act {{authorised}} a canal from Taunton to Topsham with {{branches to}} Tiverton and Cullompton. Water supply would {{be derived from}} proposed reservoirs, one on <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Tone and two on <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Culm, and from any other available sources within 2000yd (1.8km) {{of the line of}} the canal. The canal company was also authorised to improve <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Tone near Taunton, and to raise £220,000, plus an additional £110,000 if required. Navigation onwards from Taunton was via <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Tone and <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Parrett. Construction did not start immediately.|$|E
50|$|Kobuleti {{has several}} <b>rivers.</b> <b>The</b> most {{important}} ones are <b>the</b> Kintrishi <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Chakvistskali <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Acharistskali <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Ochkhamuri <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Achkva <b>River,</b> and <b>the</b> Dekhva <b>River.</b>|$|R
50|$|The lake is fed by 45000 km2 of {{catchment}} areas and its 21 major tributaries. Among these are <b>the</b> Pagsanjan <b>River</b> which is <b>the</b> source of 35% of the Lake's water, <b>the</b> Santa Cruz <b>River</b> which is <b>the</b> source of 15% of the Lake's water, <b>the</b> Balanak <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Marikina <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Mangangate <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Tunasan <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> San Pedro <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Cabuyao <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> San Cristobal <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> San Juan <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Bay, Calo and Maitem <b>rivers</b> in Bay, <b>the</b> Molawin, Dampalit and Pele rivers in Los Baños, <b>the</b> Pangil <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Tanay <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Morong <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Siniloan <b>River</b> and <b>the</b> Sapang Baho <b>River.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{principal}} <b>rivers</b> in <b>the</b> district are <b>the</b> Nhamapadza <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Fudja <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Nhanzuazua <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Sambeza <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Pundza <b>River,</b> and <b>the</b> Mupa <b>River,</b> most {{of which}} originate in Manica Province.|$|R
5|$|The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal {{opened in}} 1827, which {{provided}} an easier route than <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> and protracted legal battles followed over ownership of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> and water {{rights for the}} canal. These were not finally resolved until 1832, when the Canal Company formally took over <b>the</b> <b>river</b> navigation. The ability to navigate <b>the</b> <b>river</b> gradually deteriorated, not helped by the abandonment of <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Parrett as a navigation in 1878. Following flooding in Taunton in 1960, much of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> between there and its mouth was straightened, and the navigation locks were removed. That at Ham was blown up by the Territorial Army. Navigation rights were repealed in 1967.|$|E
5|$|The Kennet and Avon Canal is a canal in {{southern}} England. The name may refer {{to either the}} route of the original Kennet and Avon Canal Company, which linked <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Kennet at Newbury to <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Avon at Bath, or to the entire navigation between <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Thames at Reading and the Floating Harbour at Bristol, including the earlier improved river navigations of <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Kennet between Reading and Newbury and <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Avon between Bath and Bristol.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>River</b> Kennet is navigable from Newbury {{downstream}} to {{the confluence}} with <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Thames at Kennet Mouth, in Reading.|$|E
50|$|There are {{numerous}} tributaries of the Abay between Lake Tana and the Sudanese border. Those on its left bank, in downstream order, include <b>the</b> Wanqa <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Bashilo <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Walaqa <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Wanchet <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Jamma <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Muger <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Guder <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Agwel <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Nedi <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Didessa <b>River</b> and <b>the</b> Dabus <b>River.</b> Those on <b>the</b> right side, also in downstream order, include the Handassa, Tul, Abaya, Sade, Tammi, Cha, Shita, Suha, Muga, Gulla, Temcha, Bachat, Katlan, Jiba, Chamoga, Weter and the Beles.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{principal}} <b>rivers</b> in <b>the</b> district are <b>the</b> Movene <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Mabenga <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Calichane <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Impaputo <b>River,</b> and <b>the</b> Umbelúzi <b>River.</b>|$|R
50|$|The water {{eventually}} {{flows through}} <b>the</b> Elk <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Watauga <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Holston <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Tennessee <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Ohio <b>River,</b> and <b>the</b> Mississippi <b>River</b> to <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico.|$|R
5|$|The busway follows {{roughly the}} Torrens River valley, but with {{smoother}} curves. This {{means that it}} crosses <b>the</b> <b>river</b> quite often, with either a park or a few houses on a point surrounded by <b>the</b> <b>river</b> and busway. This occurs a total of eight times before the busway reaches Klemzig Interchange {{on the north side}} of <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> The busway crosses <b>the</b> <b>river</b> again soon after Klemzig and passes Lochiel Park and part of the suburbs of Campbelltown and Paradise to its north between the busway and <b>the</b> <b>river</b> before reaching Paradise Interchange.|$|E
5|$|The outflow {{from the}} works, which passes under <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Don Navigation and joins <b>the</b> <b>river</b> beside Jordans weir, {{has in the}} past been a major {{contributor}} to the pollution of <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Don, but some £70 million has been invested in upgrading the plant, to ensure that discharges to <b>the</b> <b>river</b> meet the requirements of the Freshwater Fish Directive. In dry weather, the outfall discharges 30 million gallons (136,000m3) of treated water each day, more than doubling the flow in <b>the</b> <b>river</b> at this point.|$|E
5|$|A 2004-05 EPA {{study of}} <b>the</b> <b>river</b> rated {{the water quality}} 6 out of 100. The study also {{discovered}} that dissolved oxygen levels in the water were low because there were few organisms, poor sediment, and little plant life in <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> Although storm water from residential neighborhoods added dissolved oxygen, it also brought ammonia from fertilizer. The Army Corps of Engineers found that the channeling prevented aquatic life from sustaining itself; few fish naturally spawn in <b>the</b> <b>river</b> because of the cement casing and flume at its mouth.|$|E
5000|$|Some of <b>the</b> main <b>rivers</b> {{that flow}} into <b>the</b> Kuzuryū <b>River</b> include: <b>the</b> Itoshiro <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Hino <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Asuwa <b>River</b> and <b>the</b> Takeda <b>River</b> ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rivers</b> {{crossing}} <b>the</b> county are <b>the</b> Siret <b>River</b> {{with its}} tributaries: <b>the</b> Moldova <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Suceava <b>River</b> and <b>the</b> Bistrița <b>River.</b>|$|R
50|$|Chatsworth is a {{township}} in south-western Ontario, Canada, in Grey County, {{located at}} the headwaters of <b>the</b> Styx <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Saugeen <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Sauble <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Bighead <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Spey <b>River,</b> and <b>the</b> old Sydenham <b>River.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{population}} of feral Mandarin ducks {{have been present}} on <b>the</b> <b>river</b> since 1978. Kingfishers and grey herons can also be seen. Otters are common {{near the mouth of}} <b>the</b> <b>river.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Crowhurst Bridge, {{which carries}} the Burwash to Stonegate road over <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> the railway {{crosses to the}} south bank. By Etchingham railway station, <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Limden joins from the north, the A265 road crosses, and <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Dudwell joins from the southwest. Both the railway and <b>the</b> <b>river</b> turn to the south to reach Robertsbridge. Another tributary, which flows to the {{northwest}} from near a gypsum mine at Brightling, turns {{to the south and}} runs parallel to the Rother before joining it in Robertsbridge. There is a network of channels, as <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Darwell joins <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> and there was formerly a mill nearby. The mill was called Hodson's Mill, and was part of Mill Farm. It burnt down in 1902, and the Georgian farmhouse was subsequently demolished. The only original farm building still standing is part of an oasthouse, dating from the late eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural {{runoff from}} farms and ranches in the Snake River Plain {{and many other}} areas has {{severely}} damaged the ecology of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> throughout the 20thcentury. After the first irrigation dams on <b>the</b> <b>river</b> began operation {{in the first decade}} of the 20thcentury, much of the arable land in a strip a few miles wide along the Snake River was cultivated or turned to pasture, and agricultural return flows began to pollute the Snake. Runoff from several feedlots was dumped into <b>the</b> <b>river</b> until laws made the practice illegal. Fertilizer, manure and other chemicals and pollutants washed into <b>the</b> <b>river</b> greatly increase the nutrient load, especially of phosphorus, fecal coliforms and nitrogen. During low water, algae blooms occur throughout the calm stretches of <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> depleting its oxygen supply.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{principal}} <b>rivers</b> in <b>the</b> district are <b>the</b> Chineziwa <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Sambanzou <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Muanza <b>River,</b> and <b>the</b> Urema <b>River.</b>|$|R
50|$|The water {{eventually}} {{flows through}} <b>the</b> Watauga <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Holston <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Tennessee <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Ohio <b>River,</b> and <b>the</b> Mississippi <b>River</b> to <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> main <b>river</b> in <b>the</b> {{district}} is <b>the</b> Ghizar <b>River,</b> {{which is known}} as <b>the</b> Gilgit <b>River</b> to <b>the</b> east of Gupis town. Some of its tributaries include <b>the</b> Karambar <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Ishkoman <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Phakora <b>River,</b> and <b>the</b> Hayal <b>River.</b>|$|R
5|$|American captain Robert Gray and British captain George Vancouver, who {{explored}} <b>the</b> <b>river</b> in 1792, {{proved that}} it was possible to cross the Columbia Bar. Many of the challenges associated with that feat remain today; even with modern engineering alterations to the mouth of <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> the strong currents and shifting sandbar make it dangerous to pass between <b>the</b> <b>river</b> and the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Anglers {{will find}} pike {{in excess of}} , with good stocks of chub, dace, roach, bream, tench, perch, rudd, and gudgeon. There are trout in the upper reaches. There are several access points along <b>the</b> <b>river</b> {{suitable}} for canoeing, and <b>the</b> <b>river</b> has been paddled as far up as Bruton, but above West Lydford only after recent rain. There are public footpaths alongside many stretches of <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> There are also areas of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> that serve as desirable spots for wild swimming.|$|E
5|$|Averell had {{anticipated}} resistance at <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> and had Powell's Brigade ready. Major Seymour B. Conger of the 3rd West Virginia Cavalry led the attack across <b>the</b> <b>river</b> {{on the east}} side of the main road. On the west side of the road, the Lincoln Cavalry crossed <b>the</b> <b>river</b> unopposed. The New Yorkers circled behind the 22nd Virginia, forcing the regiment to retreat from the riverbank.|$|E
