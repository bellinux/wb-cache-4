Originally known as the Great Parlour, <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> the chief reception room of the house. It retains its original marble fireplace and has an ornate plaster ceiling which is a Victorian copy of the original ceiling by the Carolean plasterer Edward Goudge. The centrepiece of the room is a large Aubusson carpet made in 1839 for the 1st Earl Brownlow.|$|E
5|$|This {{narrative}} {{has been}} disputed by the historian Steven Newton, who dedicated {{a section of}} his 2002 publication about Operation Citadel to refuting it. Using first-hand accounts of German officers that executed Operation Citadel and scrutinizing Glantz and House's sources, Newton contended that the plan for the 4th Panzer Army to swing from the Oboyan direction to Prokhorovka was decided as early as May 1943, well before Operation Citadel even commenced, as German planners of Army Group South had always expected an encounter between the 4th Panzer Army and Soviet reserves that would arrive at the Psel River and Prokhorovka. Other historians have corroborated these conclusions. Newton also asserts that <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> the accepted narrative in post-war literature.|$|E
25|$|Brøns Church, {{located in}} Southern Jutland, south of Ribe, {{contains}} two Lutheran frescos, dating from c. 1530, which are probably Denmark's only examples of church frescos with distinctly Lutheran messages. One shows a heavenly castle under siege. An army led by pope and bishops try {{to gain access}} to it by force, while Christ — guarding its city gate — rejects them. Another image shows the pope and a number of bishops presenting a large papal bull, carrying a total of 11 ecclesiastic seals but no text. It is unknown whether <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> the case, but the presence of two fools, one of them holding a pair of reading glasses, indicates that this is the intention; the Catholic Church is presented as without content. Below, a monk, standing a front of a group of men holding letters of indulgence is confronted by another group of people holding similar letters. This protest scene against the sale of indulgences is inspired by a contemporary woodcarving by Nuremberg artist, Hans Sebald Beham, who was staunchly anti-Catholic.|$|E

2500|$|LaVeyan Satanism is {{critical}} of Abrahamic sexual mores, considering them narrow, restrictive and hypocritical. Satanists are pluralists, accepting polyamorists, bisexuals, lesbians, gays, BDSM, transgender people, and asexuals. Sex is viewed as an indulgence, but one that should only be freely entered into with consent. The Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth only give two instructions regarding sex: [...] "Do not make sexual advances unless you are given the mating signal" [...] and [...] "Do not harm little children," [...] though the latter is much broader and encompasses physical and other abuse. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> consistent part of CoS policy {{since its inception in}} 1966, as Peter H.

2500|$|No Country for Old Men premiered in {{competition}} at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival on May 19. Stephen Robb of the BBC covered the film opening at Cannes. [...] "With no sign yet of an undisputed classic {{in competition}} at this 60th Cannes," [...] he said, [...] "No Country for Old Men may have emerged as a frontrunner for the trophy Joel and Ethan Coen collected for Barton Fink in 1991.

2500|$|During Ellison's 2006 campaign, Republican blogger Michael Brodkorb {{unearthed}} posts about Ellison's Minnesota Daily {{articles and}} {{his involvement with}} the Nation of Islam.

In 2016, CNN referred instead to Ellison's [...] "decade-long involvement in the Nation of Islam". In Ellison's letter, he denounced the Nation of Islam and Farrakhan, writing, [...] "I wrongly dismissed concerns that they [...] were anti-Semitic. They were and are anti-Semitic and I should have come to that conclusion earlier than I did." [...] He explained his previous views, saying that he [...] "did not adequately scrutinize the positions and statements of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan, and Khalid Muhammed." [...] He also stated, [...] "any kind of discrimination and hate are wrong. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> my position". During the 2006 campaign, many prominent Jewish DFL activists supported Ellison, including fundraisers Samuel and Sylvia Kaplan, and State Representative Phyllis Kahn, who said it was [...] "inconceivable that he could have ever been an anti-Semite." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1966 Midwest Regional Finals, Kansas, {{the favored}} team to face Kentucky, played Texas Western. Texas Western got a {{controversial}} double overtime victory, 81–80. The would-be winning shot, a 35-footer, {{at the buzzer}} was made by All-American Jo Jo White {{at the end of}} the first overtime, but White was called for stepping on the sideline, ironically being penalized for being too far away from the basket and the shot was negated. [...] <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> highly contested and a [...] of the play shows his heel over the line but not on the floor. [...] Being the only piece of impartial evidence, it is impossible to tell whether his heel came up from the line prior to the photo, or whether his heel dropped to the line following the photo. [...] Also noted in the photograph is the fact that the referee is not looking at his foot. [...] This supports Ted Owens' objection that the call was made late, if the ref did not see his foot until after the shot. [...] The Kansas players were celebrating when they were told the game was going to a 2nd overtime. Regardless of what actually happened, Texas Western was given the victory and advanced to the Final Four. [...] The game is immortalized in the 2006 film Glory Road which is based on that season's Texas Western team.|$|E
