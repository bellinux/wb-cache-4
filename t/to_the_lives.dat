5|$|According to Pulitzer Prize winner Jhumpa Lahiri, Narayan's {{short stories}} {{have the same}} {{captivating}} feeling as his novels, with most of them less than ten pages long, and taking about as many minutes to read. She adds that between the title sentence and the end, Narayan provides the reader something novelists struggle to achieve in hundreds more pages: a complete insight <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> of his characters. These characteristics and abilities led Lahiri to classify him as belonging to the pantheon of short-story geniuses that include O. Henry, Frank O'Connor and Flannery O'Connor. Lahiri also compares him to Guy de Maupassant {{for their ability to}} compress the narrative without losing the story, and the common themes of middle-class life written with an unyielding and unpitying vision.|$|E
5|$|As {{a popular}} {{actor in the}} 1860s, Booth {{continued}} to travel extensively to perform in the North and South, and as far west as New Orleans, Louisiana. According to his sister Asia, Booth confided {{to her that he}} also used his position to smuggle the anti-malarial drug quinine, which was crucial <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> of residents of the Gulf coast, to the South during his travels there, since it was in short supply due to the Northern blockade.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} the trial, {{questions}} were raised about the fairness and legality of the court-martial proceedings. Owing to public pressure, the United States Navy reconvened the courts-martial board in 1945; the court affirmed the guilt of the convicted men. Widespread publicity surrounding the case {{turned it into a}} cause célèbre among certain Americans; it and other race-related Navy protests of 1944–45 led the Navy to change its practices and initiate the desegregation of its forces beginning in February 1946. In 1994, the Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial was dedicated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> lost in the disaster.|$|E

5|$|More than 11,000 years ago, prehistoric Native Americans lived {{along the}} Snake. Salmon from the Pacific Ocean spawned by the {{millions}} in the river. These fish were central <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> of the people along the Snake below Shoshone Falls. By the time Lewis and Clark crossed the Rockies and sighted the valley of a Snake tributary, the Nez Perce and Shoshone were the most powerful peoples in the region. Some tribes adopted use of horses after contact with Europeans, which reshaped their hunting and cultures {{for the next few}} hundred years before outside settlement. Later explorers and fur trappers further changed and used the resources of the Snake River basin. At one point, a hand sign made by the Shoshones representing fish was misinterpreted to represent a snake, giving the Snake River its name.|$|E
5|$|His view (part of a {{tradition}} {{that goes back to}} J. J. Müller, who advanced Marius' claims as early as 1870, and supported by modern scholars such as André Chastagnol) was vigorously contested by Ronald Syme, who theorized that virtually all the identifiable citations from Marius Maximus are essentially frivolous interpolations into the main narrative source, which he postulated was a different Latin author whom he styled 'Ignotus ("the unknown one"), the good biographer'. His theory argued, firstly, that as Marius wrote a sequel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lives</b> of the Twelve Caesars, his work covered the reigns from Nerva to Elagabalus; consequently, this would not have included a biography of Lucius Verus, even though the biography of that Princeps in the History is mainly of good quality. Secondly, that 'Ignotus' only went up to Caracalla, as is revealed by the inferior and mostly fictitious biography of Macrinus. Finally, that the composer of the Historia Augusta wrote the lives of the emperors through to the Life of Caracalla (including Lucius Verus) using Ignotus as his main source, and supplementing with Marius Maximus on occasion. It was only when the source failed that he turned to other less reliable sources (such as Herodian and Maximus), as well as his own fertile imagination, and it was at this juncture that he composed the first five minor lives, through to the Life of Geta.|$|E
