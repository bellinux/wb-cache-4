50|$|Titanium {{is used in}} {{steelmaking}} for deoxidation, grain-size control, {{and carbon}} and nitrogen control and stabilization. During steelmaking, titanium is usually introduced as ferrotitanium because of its relatively low melting temperature and high density. Steels with relatively high titanium content include interstitial-free, stainless and high-strength low-alloy steels. Ferrotitanium is usually produced by induction melting of <b>titanium</b> <b>scrap</b> with iron or steel; however, it also is produced directly from titanium mineral concentrates. The standard grades of ferrotitanium are 30% and 70% titanium. Ferrosilicon-titanium also is produced to allow the simultaneous addition of silicon and titanium. The leading ferrotitanium producing countries include Brazil, China, India, Japan, Russia, Ukraine, United Kingdom and the United States.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The use of plasma hrnaces for the {{recycling}} of metal scrap, of metallurgical residues and of fly-ashes from {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) and sewage sludge (SS) incineration is reviewed. Aluminium dross, <b>titanium</b> <b>scrap,</b> spent automotive catalysts and stainless steelmaking dust are examples of current plasma melting applications. Whereever possible, hollow graphite electrodes tend to replace water-cooled metal torches. This trend also holds for plasma processing of MSW and SS incineration residues. In comparative pilot tests with these residues carried out with transferred-arc metal plasma torches and with graphite electrodes, respectively, no difference in processing behavior was observed. Under oxidizing conditions in the hrnaces and in the off-gas systems, any de novo synthesis of dioxins was avoided and a vitrified slag, a small off-gas volume and a secondary fly-ash mainly containing volatile chlorides and sulfates were obtained. 1...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{process of}} {{recycling}} <b>titanium</b> metal <b>scraps</b> by utilizing chloride wastes (e. g., FeClx and AlCl 3) that are obtained as by-products in the Kroll process {{or any other}} chlorination process has been investigated in this study. This is important {{from the viewpoint of}} the increase in <b>titanium</b> metal <b>scraps</b> and chloride wastes in the future. Thermodynamic analyses and some primary experiments have been carried out in previous studies. Based on these studies, a fundamental study was carried out: titanium granules were reacted with iron chloride (FeCl 2) in a sealed quartz tube under a reduced argon atmosphere over a temperature range of 900 â€“ 1300 K. The analytical results of the obtained samples determined using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), the potentiometric titration method, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses reveal that the chlorine contained in the chloride wastes can be recovered by titanium granules as titanium chloride and the obtained titanium chloride can be easily separated from iron and other chlorides and then recovered. The recovered titanium chloride can be used as the feed material in titanium smelting processes...|$|R
5000|$|Ferro{{titanium}} is a ferroalloy, an alloy of {{iron and}} titanium with between 10-20% iron and 45-75% titanium and sometimes {{a small amount of}} carbon. It is used in steelmaking as a cleansing agent for iron and steel; the titanium is highly reactive with sulfur, carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen, forming insoluble compounds and sequestering them in slag, and is therefore used for deoxidizing, and sometimes for desulfurization and denitrification. In steelmaking the addition of titanium yields metal with finer grain structure. Ferrotitanium can be manufactured by mixing <b>titanium</b> sponge and <b>scrap</b> with iron and melting them together in an induction furnace. [...] Ferrotitanium powder can be also used as a fuel in some pyrotechnic compositions.|$|R
