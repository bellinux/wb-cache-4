5|$|Farm {{animals are}} {{widespread}} {{in books and}} songs for children; the reality of animal husbandry is often distorted, softened, or idealized, giving children an almost entirely fictitious account of farm life. The books often depict a rural idyll of happy animals free to roam in attractive countryside, which is completely at odds with <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> impersonal, mechanized activities involved in modern intensive farming.|$|E

The audience learns salesman Jim Halpert has a crush on receptionist Pam Beesly (who helps him play pranks on co-worker Dwight Schrute), {{even though she is}} engaged to Roy (who works in the building's lower-level warehouse). News spreads throughout the office that Dunder Mifflin's corporate headquarters is planning to downsize an entire branch, leading to general anxiety, but Michael chooses to deny or downplay <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation in order to maintain employee morale.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, {{rock and roll}} was faltering as its major stars dropped from public view. Elvis Presley was drafted, Buddy Holly and Eddie Cochran died in 1959 and 1960 respectively, Chuck Berry was in jail, and Jerry Lee Lewis had been disgraced by press reports that he married his 13-year-old cousin. Music and culture critic Nelson George disagrees with music historians who attest {{the last two years}} of the 1950s were barren of talent, {{pointing}} to Charles and this song in particular. George writes that the themes in Charles' work were very similar to the young rebels who popularized rock and roll, writing By breaking down the division between pulpit and bandstand, recharging blues concerns with transcendental fervor, unashamedly linking the spiritual and the sexual, Charles made pleasure (physical satisfaction) and joy (divine enlightenment) seem the same thing. By doing so he brought <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Saturday-night sinner and Sunday-morning worshipper—so often one and the same—into raucous harmony.|$|E

30|$|Images {{produce a}} <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> their own. This {{specific}} reality cannot be grasped by dualistically separating {{it from an}} alleged <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> ‘the factual’. We can clearly see this effect of creating an ‘own’ <b>reality</b> in works <b>of</b> art of abstract modernism displaying something which eludes objective, measurable and countable approaches. What is displayed by these images points to meaning (or emotion) rather than matter. This implicit meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image is perceived as <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image. From an epistemological perspective, <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image and <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factual are incongruent and disparate (Schütz 2016 a, 2016 b). <b>The</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image with its inherent logic and materiality can become tangible precisely in this incongruity. From an epistemological point <b>of</b> view, <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image is not only perceived as reality, but also responded to immediately. <b>The</b> multitude <b>of</b> experiences which are constituted while looking at an image are immediate responses to <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image. <b>The</b> inherent, experiential <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image is grounded in this pre-verbal and implicit meaning.|$|R

5|$|Keable {{eventually}} achieved {{his wish}} {{of going to}} war in 1917, when a South African contingent was mustered for military service in France and Keable volunteered {{to go with them}} as chaplain. His experiences there were to form the basis for his first and most successful novel, Simon Called Peter. Appointed an army chaplain on 26 May 1917, Keable travelled to the Rouen sector with a Native Labour Contingent of 21,000 men. These men were paid £3 per month to unload supply ships and provide infrastructure support for military operations in Europe. As a chaplain, with the rank of captain, Keable was expected to be at the disposal of the army at large, and ministered to those seeing active infantry service as well as to labourers. Padres were formally required to remain behind the lines, but it is apparent that Keable nonetheless saw something of <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frontline.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1925 {{tensions}} between the Druze chiefs of the Hauran led by Sultan Pasha al-Atrash and the French authorities culminated with the Great Syrian Revolt, which spread throughout Syria within months. While Quwatli's Istiqlal Party lobbied the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Amin al-Husseini {{to set up a}} financial support network for the rebellion, Quwatli had already secured the funneling of funds and arms from the Hejaz and also diverted some of the military aid to the Jerusalem-based committee. As the revolt's initial momentum began to recede in mid-1926, bickering between opposition leaders, inside and outside of Syria, increased significantly. Quwatli was accused by his rivals in Cairo of pocketing some money he raised and paying off rebels to prevent rebel raids against his family's extensive apricot orchards in the Ghouta. Tensions between Istiqlalists like Quwatli and Arslan and other Syrian nationalist leaders like al-Bakri and Shahbandar, were particularly sharp, with the latter accusing Quwatli of being out of touch from <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> revolt, and Quwatli accusing Shahbandar of treason for attempting to stop the insurrection.|$|E

5000|$|Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindi had {{originally}} declared <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Quran (haqiqat-i quran) and <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ka'ba (haqiqat-i ka'ba-yi rabbani) {{to be above}} <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> Muhammad (haqiqat-i Muhammadi). This caused fury of opposition, particularly among certain sufis and ulama of Hijaz who objected to the Ka'ba having exalted spiritual [...] "rank" [...] than the Prophet. Sirhindi argued in response that <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prophet is superior to any creature. The real Ka'ba is worthy of prostration since it is not created and is covered with <b>the</b> veil <b>of</b> nonexistence. It is this Ka'ba in <b>the</b> essence <b>of</b> God that Sirhindi was referring to as <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ka'ba, not <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ka'ba (surat-i ka'ba), which is only a stone. By <b>the</b> latter part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nineteenth century, <b>the</b> consensus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Naqshbandi community had placed <b>the</b> prophetic <b>realities</b> closer to God than <b>the</b> divine <b>realities.</b> <b>The</b> rationale for this development may have been to neutralize unnecessary discord with the large Muslim community whose emotional attachment to Muhammad was greater than any understanding of philosophical fine points.|$|R
