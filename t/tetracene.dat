Also in 1965, W. Helfrich and W. G. Schneider of the National Research Council in Canada produced double injection recombination electroluminescence for the first time in an anthracene single crystal using hole and electron injecting electrodes, the forerunner of modern double-injection devices. In the same year, Dow Chemical researchers patented a method of preparing electroluminescent cells using high-voltage (500–1500 V) AC-driven (100–3000Hz) electrically insulated one millimetre thin layers of a melted phosphor consisting of ground anthracene powder, <b>tetracene,</b> and graphite powder.

40|$|In {{the first}} chapter, a phosphine-mediated multi-component {{reaction}} between o-phthalaldehydes, nucleophiles and monosubstituted allenes furnished the functionalized non-C 2 -symmetric naphthalenes in synthetically useful yields. Also, when the o-phthalaldehydes were reacted with 1, 3 -disubstituted allenes {{in the presence}} of diethylphenylphosphine, naphthalene derivatives were obtained in yields up to quantitative. The mechanism of the latter transformation is straightforward, involving aldol addition followed by Wittig olefination and dehydration. The mechanism of the former reaction has been established as a tandem γ-umpolung/aldol/Wittig/dehydration process through careful analysis of data based on the preparation of putative reaction intermediates and mass spectrometry. The current method can also be applied iteratively to prepare anthracenes and <b>tetracenes</b> when carboxylic acids are employed as pronucleophiles. In the second chapter, a novel bridged [2. 2. 1] bicyclic phosphine oxide, devised to circumvent the burdens of waste generation and purification that are typical of Wittig olefination, has been prepared from commercially available cyclopent- 3 -ene- 1 -carboxylic acid through three steps. This new catalyst was designed based on the theoretical transition state geometry of the silane-mediated reduction of phosphine oxides. The superior performance of this novel phosphine oxide has been verified experimentally through kinetic analysis of its silane-mediated reduction, as well as catalytic Staudinger reduction, in comparison to the current bests. It has also been applied successfully in halide-/base-free catalytic γ-umpolung addition–Wittig olefinations of allenoates and 2 -amidobenzaldehydes to produce 1, 2 -dihydroquinolines with extraordinary efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Chapter 1. The {{synthesis}} {{of a group}} of alkoxy-substituted para-acenequinones and their photophysical properties in solution and liquid crystal are reported. Polarized absorption and fluorescence measurements demonstrate that these acenequinones have excellent alignment with nematic LC hosts, indicating their potential as dichroic dyes for guest-host liquid crystal displays. In addition, the sensitivity of emission to the substitution allows the tuning of emission by functionalization of the acenequinone chromophore. Chapter 2. The {{synthesis of}} a series of fluorine- and alkyl/alkoxy-functionalized <b>tetracenes</b> using N-methyl- 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrafluoroisoindole as a synthetic building block is reported. The incorporation of fluorine functionalities was found to induce significant face-to-face molecular n-stacking in their crystal structures. Electrochemical behaviors and UV-vis absorbance spectroscopy results of these materials are also discussed. It was demonstrated that the substitution of alkyl/alkoxy groups on the main chain not only provided better solubility in common organic solvents, but also subtly tuned the crystal structures and electrochemical behaviors. Chapter 3. A self-polymerizable AB-type monomer for Diels-Alder (D-A) polymerization was prepared, and its polymerization was carried out in the melt phase and at high pressure in solution. The former method generated only low molecular weight polymer, but the latter one offered an efficient polymerization with increased molecular weight, due to the effect of high-pressure on reactions with a negative activation volume. A pyridinium p-toluenesulfonate catalyzed dehydration reaction of the D-A polymer led to a novel aromatic ladder polymer, poly(iptycene), which is soluble in common organic solvents and stable up to 350 oC. (cont.) The NMR and UV-vis spectra of these polymers match the spectra of their corresponding model compounds, and their synthesis is also reported. Chapter 4. Two diamino functionalized iptycene monomers were successfully synthesized via two synthetic routes: a direct nitration of triptycene followed by a reduction with hydrazine and D-A reaction between a benzo-fused 1, 4 -endoxide and 2, 6 -diaminoanthracene followed by a strong acid catalyzed dehydration. Their applications in the synthesis of novel triptycene-containing polyimides and polyureas were investigated and the resulting polymers were characterized by NMR, FT-IR, and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. Chapter 5. Iptycene type quinoxaline and thienopyrazine monomers were successfully synthesized via a condensation between 10 -dihydro- 9, 10 -ethanoanthracene- 11, 12 -dione and the corresponding diamines. Copolymers based on fluorene and these new iptycene monomers were prepared via Suzuki coupling reaction, and they exhibited good solubility in appropriate organic solvents. These copolymers are fluorescent both in solution and the solid state, emitting blue, greenish-blue, and red color, due to the electronic properties of the iptycene comonomers. The difference in their absorption and emission spectra was attributed to the donor-acceptor charge transfer interactions and/or polymer backbone conformation change induced by steric effects. Moreover, the spectroscopic data clearly demonstrated the insulating effect of iptycene units, which prevented the aggregation of the polymer chains and formation of excimers in the solid state. by Zhihua Chen.

While some dyes are actually used in food coloring, most dyes are very toxic, and often carcinogenic. Many dyes, such as rhodamine 6G, (in its chloride form), can be very corrosive to all metals except stainless steel. Although dyes have very broad fluorescence spectra, the dye's absorption and emission will tend to center on a certain wavelength and taper off to each side, forming a tunability curve, with the absorption center being of a shorter wavelength than the emission center. Rhodamine 6G, for example, has its highest output around 590 nm, and the conversion efficiency lowers as the laser is tuned {{to either side of}} this wavelength.|$|E

5000|$|QTAIM {{is applied}} to the {{description}} of certain organic crystals with unusually short distances between neighboring molecules as observed by X-ray diffraction. For example, in the crystal structure of molecular chlorine the experimental Cl...Cl distance between two molecules is 327 picometres which is less than the sum of the van der Waals radii of 350 picometres. In one QTAIM result 12 bond paths start from each chlorine atom to other chlorine atoms including the other chlorine atom in the molecule. The theory also aims to explain the metallic properties of metallic hydrogen in much the same way. The theory is also applied to so-called hydrogen-hydrogen bonds [...] as they occur in molecules such as phenanthrene and chrysene. In these compounds the distance between two ortho hydrogen atoms again is shorter than their van der Waals radii and according to in silico experiments based on this theory, a bond path is identified between them. Both hydrogen atoms have identical electron density and are closed shell and therefore they are very different from the so-called dihydrogen bonds which are postulated for compounds such as (CH3)2NHBH3 and also different from so-called agostic interactions. In mainstream chemistry close proximity of two nonbonding atoms leads to destabilizing steric repulsion but in QTAIM the observed hydrogen hydrogen interactions are in fact stabilizing. It is well known that both kinked phenanthrene and chrysene are around 6 kcal/mol (25 kJ/mol) more stable than their linear isomers anthracene and <b>tetracene.</b> One traditional explanation is given by Clar's rule. QTAIM shows that a calculated stabilization for phenanthrene by 8 kcal/mol (33 kJ/mol) is the result of destabilization of the compound by 8 kcal/mol (33 kJ/mol) originating from electron transfer from carbon to hydrogen, offset by 12.1 kcal (51 kJ/mol) of stabilization due to a H..H bond path. The electron density at the critical point between the two hydrogen atoms is low, 0.012 e for phenanthrene. Another property of the bond path is its curvature. Another molecule studied in QTAIM is biphenyl. Its two phenyl rings are oriented at a 38° angle with respect to each other with the planar molecular geometry (encountered in a rotation around the central C-C bond) destabilized by 2.1 kcal/mol (8.8 kJ/mol) and the perpendicular one destabilized by 2.5 kcal/mol (10.5 kJ/mol). The classic explanations for this rotation barrier are steric repulsion between the ortho-hydrogen atoms (planar) and breaking of delocalization of pi density over both rings (perpendicular).|$|E

40|$|Singlet fission (SF) is {{a process}} in organic {{molecules}} that is able to create two triplet excitons from one initially excited singlet exciton. Beyond its interest as a unique photophysical process, SF is also worth studying due to its capability to enhance the overall efficiencies of photovoltaic cells beyond the Shockley-Queisser limit. In order {{to take advantage of}} this process, a more thorough understanding of how it occurs and how it can be enhanced is needed. Specifically, this work begins to answer some of the larger questions about SF within <b>tetracene.</b> SF was first observed in anthracene in 1965, and has since been found to occur in larger polyacenes and other conjugated organic molecules. This study focuses on crystalline <b>tetracene</b> for several reasons, most notably for its favorable energy levels for the study of the interaction between the singlet and triplet excitons, greater chemical stability, and large body of previous work. In this work, the electronic states of <b>tetracene</b> are characterized with time resolved photoluminescence and transient absorption spectroscopies in order to determine the rate and mechanism of SF within crystalline <b>tetracene,</b> which have not been conclusively shown in prior studies. Using spectroscopy measurements, this work has determined that SF is occurring within crystalline <b>tetracene</b> with a formation time of 80 ± 3 ps, which leads to a triplet yield of 200 %. Additionally, the study of the temperature dependence of crystalline <b>tetracene</b> photoluminescence has shown that the fission of a singlet into two triplets may not be thermally activated, a finding which is unexpected based on previous work. Furthermore, observation of quantum beats within the delayed fluorescence of single crystals of <b>tetracene</b> strongly suggests that the singlet fissions directly into two triplets rather than proceeding through a charge-transfer intermediate.
