5|$|Cerro Blanco {{is part of}} the Central Volcanic Zone and {{is located}} at the {{southern}} limit of the Puna. It forms a volcanic unit together with the Aguada Alumbrera ignimbrite, at {{the eastern edge of the}} Cordillera de San Buenaventura. Rocks beneath this unit include dacitic–trachyandesitic volcanites 9–7 mya old and an igneous-metamorphic granitic basement containing orthogneiss, quartz of Neoproterozoic-early Paleozoic age, containing paleozoic mafic to ultramafic volcanic inclusions. The Cordillera de San Buenaventura is formed from lava domes and volcanic complexes of intermediary composition of Upper Miocene–Quaternary age. During the Miocene-Pleistocene, the isotope and chemical composition of areal magmas has moved away from arc like magmas to distinctly water-poor and unoxidized petrologies. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> with a hot mantle forming after delamination of the crust and migration of the arc.|$|E

In a prospective study of 9570 individuals over four years, highly conscientious people suffered {{more than twice as much}} if they became unemployed. The authors suggested this may be due to conscientious people making different attributions about why they became unemployed, or through experiencing stronger reactions following failure. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> with perspectives which see no trait as inherently positive or negative, but rather the consequences of the trait being dependent on the situation and concomitant goals and motivations.|$|E

2500|$|Ruderfer et al. (2006) {{analyzed}} the ancestry of natural S. cerevisiae strains {{and concluded that}} outcrossing occurs only about once every 50,000 cell divisions. Thus, it appears that in nature, mating is likely most often between closely related yeast cells. [...] Mating occurs when haploid cells of opposite mating type MATa and MATα come into contact. [...] Ruderfer et al. pointed out that such contacts are frequent between closely related yeast cells for two reasons. [...] The first is that cells of opposite mating type are present {{together in the same}} ascus, the sac that contains the cells directly produced by a single meiosis, and these cells can mate with each other. [...] The second reason is that haploid cells of one mating type, upon cell division, often produce cells of the opposite mating type with which they can mate. The relative rarity in nature of meiotic events that result from outcrossing is inconsistent with the idea that production of genetic variation is the main selective force maintaining meiosis in this organism. [...] However, <b>this</b> <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> with the alternative idea that the main selective force maintaining meiosis is enhanced recombinational repair of DNA damage, since this benefit is realized during each meiosis, whether or not out-crossing occurs.|$|E
2500|$|Also, at the {{recommendation}} of Houston Police Chief Harold Hurtt, White had 50 red-light cameras installed around Houston. Originally four intersections were {{used to test the}} traffic cameras in September 2006. The trial cameras met the requirements and were approved for using throughout the city. The red-light cameras caused controversy, though, even leading to some lawsuits. Many people argued that this was just a way for the city to make money at the expense of public safety. However, White has stood behind his decision to keep the red light cameras. Studies have revealed mixed results of the effectiveness of red-light cameras. A study in Houston in 2008 revealed an increase in accidents at intersections with red light cameras, although it also revealed a decrease in citations. A city-financed study of red-light cameras at Houston intersections shows traffic accidents doubled at those intersections in their first year. [...] The study also found that citations decreased. However, other studies have found that red-light cameras reduce accidents and citations. A study by Texas A University found that accidents were reduced in Texas by 30%. Several studies funded by insurance trade groups which study traffic safety, have found the cameras had a dramatic effect and reduced accidents by as much as 30 percent. A study released in 2008 from the Texas Transportation Institute found a 30 percent reduction across the state. A study in Lubbock, Texas of red light cameras showed a 52% increase in accidents, so the City Council voted against installing them. A news investigation found that the Houston intersections with cameras often had yellow lights that were too short, and violated Texas Department of Public Safety recommendations. Houston suburb Sugar Land found that the combination of lengthening yellow lights and installing cameras reduced violations by 96 percent. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> with a March 2005 Texas Transportation Institute study of 181 Texas intersections during a three-year period which found that increasing the length of yellow-light time by one second reduced violations by 53 percent and crashes by 40 percent.|$|E

40|$|The purpose ofthe {{study was}} to examine the relationshq) between self-serving {{cognitive}} distortions and involvement in bullying behaviours. While relationships were e}q) k) red for both bullies and victims, the bully represented the main focus ofthis research. The participants ofthis study were 206 elementary school children in grades 5, 6, 7, and 8 from a school board in South Western Ontario. Participants conq>leted a 2 - part self-report questionnaire within a 1 -week time period. Part I aimed to measure self-serving cognitive distortions, while Part II was designed to assess selfreports of bullying behaviours. Analyses revealed that a significant direct relationship existed between children's self-serving cognitive distortions and bullying others. More specifically, children's self-serving cognitive distortions were moderately correlated with bullying others (r =. 50, p< 0. 01). <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>consistent</b> for both male and female participants. In addition, significant moderate correlations also existed between each ofthe 9 subscales ofself-serving cognitive distortions and bullying others. In regard to the relationship between children's self-serving cognitive distortions and victimization, a low significant direct relationshq) was found (r =. 22 p< 0. 01). <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>consistent</b> for both male and female participants.

Indeed, consumers {{seemed to get}} disheartened by the firm’s malevolent activities. Second, if an apparel firm {{is perceived to be}} malevolent, the study finding showed that consumers may see the firm as untrustworthy even if it may be a credible firm. In addition, when consumers were exposed to messages about the firm’s malevolent business practices, perceived trust made a greater impact on the participant’s overall purchase intention than when consumers were exposed to benevolent messages. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>consistent</b> with heart rate deceleration patterns.|$|R

30|$|Investigation of {{rates of}} {{apoptosis}} {{as measured by}} flow cytometry showed little or no toxicity of ATO towards HK cells, with more than 99  % of HK cells remaining alive following both treatment regimes with ATO. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>consistent</b> with the confocal microscopy results. Furthermore, control liposomes encapsulating Ni only were not toxic to any cells within the concentration range of ATO used in this study. A higher percentage of live HeLa and C 33 a cells were found to remain following treatment with liposomal ATO compared to treatment with free ATO (Table  3).

50|$|A {{study by}} {{researchers}} at the Federal Judicial Center has found that the enactment of CAFA was followed by {{an increase in the number}} of class actions filed in or removed to the federal courts based on diversity jurisdiction. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> with the congressional intent in enacting CAFA. The observed increase was due primarily to increases in consumer class actions. Somewhat surprisingly, the FJC study found that much of the increase in diversity class actions has been driven by an increase in original filings in federal courts. This finding suggests that plaintiffs' attorneys are choosing the federal forum, post-CAFA, rather than defendants' counsel through removal, contrary to expectations.|$|E
