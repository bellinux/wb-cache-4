Union General John C. Frémont placed the city under martial law in August 1861 to suppress sedition; after Fremont's dismissal, Union army forces continued to suppress pro-Confederate demonstrations. The war significantly damaged St. Louis commerce, especially after the Confederacy blockaded the Mississippi shutting off St. Louis's connection <b>to</b> <b>eastern</b> markets. War also slowed growth during the 1860s, with an increase of only 43,000 residents from 1860 to 1866.|$|E

In the autumn, Heraclius threatened Persian communications from the Euphrates valley to Anatolia by marching to Cappadocia.

5|$|Colder October and November weather limited aerial {{activities}} {{over the}} NDH. The Partisan operations spread <b>to</b> <b>eastern</b> Serbian territory and the squadrons based at Sarajevo airfield made their {{appearance on the}} Bosnian-Serbian border area. The Partisans were trying to secure and expand their territory {{in the eastern part}} of Yugoslavia, which they had liberated in the autumn of 1941. The ZNDH flew daily supply missions with their Avia-Fokker F.39 and due to the lack of other aircraft also used the venerable Breguets and Potez. These could land on hastily prepared strips and performed very well in airlifting supplies to the surrounded garrison of Višegrad.|$|E

5|$|During the Battle of Vergas, Ibrahim {{decided to}} attack the Maniots from the rear. His plan was to send a small fleet with a few {{soldiers}} to land at the Bay of Diros, 2 kilometers south of Areopolis.

He would then be able {{to attack the}} Maniots from the rear and control the mountain passes <b>to</b> <b>eastern</b> Mani and Gytheio.

5|$|During the {{conflict}} over the Toledo Strip, the Erie Canal was built, linking New York City and the Eastern seaboard to the Great Lakes at Buffalo. The canal, finished in 1825, immediately became a major route for trade and migration. Corn and other farm products (from the Midwest) could be shipped <b>to</b> <b>eastern</b> markets for much less expense than the older route along the Mississippi River. In addition, the migration of settlers to the Midwest increased sharply after the canal was finished, turning Buffalo and other port cities into boomtowns.|$|E

Following intense negotiations with the Papacy in Rome and the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, Bulgaria converted <b>to</b> <b>Eastern</b> Orthodox Christianity, which caused discontent among part of the nobility who directly associated the new religion with the Byzantine Empire and feared that the country would fall under Byzantine influence.|$|E
