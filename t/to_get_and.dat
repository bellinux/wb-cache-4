5|$|DeHavilland's career spanned 53 years, from 1935 to 1988. During that time, she {{appeared}} in 49 feature films, {{and was one of}} the leading movie stars during the golden age of Classical Hollywood. She began her career playing demure ingénues opposite popular male stars, including Errol Flynn, with whom she made her breakout film Captain Blood in 1935. They would go on to make eight more feature films together, and became one of Hollywood's most popular romantic on-screen pairings. Her range of performances included roles in most major movie genres. Following her film debut in the Shakespeare adaptation A Midsummer Night's Dream, deHavilland achieved her initial popularity in romantic comedies, such as The Great Garrick and Hard <b>to</b> <b>Get,</b> <b>and</b> Western adventure films, such as Dodge City and Santa Fe Trail. In her later career, she was most successful in drama films, such as In This Our Life and Light in the Piazza, and psychological dramas playing non-glamorous characters in films such as The Dark Mirror, The Snake Pit, and Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte.|$|E

Under the Derg business licenses became progressively more difficult <b>to</b> <b>get,</b> <b>and</b> traders' trucks were requisitioned for the transport of war-related materials to army bases in Eritrea. Permits of travel were required; convoys were introduced by 1976; and the road links to Asmara were virtually broken, largely by the ELF, by the late 1970s.|$|E
25|$|In 1957, {{there were}} 50 GMs (USSR: 19, Yugoslavia: 7, USA: 5, Argentina: 4, West Germany: 2, France: 2, Sweden: 1, Czechoslovakia: 1, Hungary: 1, Austria: 1, Belgium: 1, Denmark: 1, Netherlands: 1, Poland: 1). In 1972, there were 88 GMs with 33 {{representing}} the USSR. The current FIDE ratings list includes over 1000 Grandmasters. Nigel Short was rated the third {{best player in}} the world in 1989 with a rating of 2650; in the 21st century such a rating would only be good enough for a player to reach the top 100 or so, with the third {{best player in the}} world usually rated around 2800. Other minor factors come into play: there are more tournaments worldwide and cheaper air travel makes them more accessible to globe-trotting chess professionals, who include many players from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe whose movements are no longer restricted as they were before the 1990s. Additionally, players can make norms in tournaments that would have been previously considered too short for norms, making norms easier <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>and</b> allowing for more norm tournaments to be held.|$|E

25|$|As the Dubois Brothers {{continued}} to make money and become wealthier they realized that the highest profits were {{in the drug trade}} realizing that a drug, especially methamphetamine, were cheap enough <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>and</b> highly addictive and once a customer was hooked they could not resist coming back for more creating a customer base. One of their previous drug pushers stated that the Dubois Brothers could get a pound of marijuana for $30 imported from Mexico and were able to sell it on the streets for up to $750 making a major profit. The Dubois Brothers, more specifically Adrien, Claude and Roland, had branched off logically into drug trafficking in the mid 70s and were controlling, in the west end and city center of Montreal, the sales of marijuana, hashish, LSD, amphetamines, and cocaine. They had a web of dealers set up to distribute the drugs all of which were working in licensed establishments under the control of {{at least one of the}} Brothers. Montreal police were able to seize a drug distribution for the Dubois Brothers that consisted of nearly two million tenure pills in late 1973 to early 1974. The Brothers took it one step further by going continental when they began having roots in Pakistan because Adrien Dubois decided to introduce a Sixth Family associate to his impressive source of hashish through a corrupt government official in Pakistan who had a ministerial position and thrived for foreign currency. The Dubois Brothers were always thirsty for more territory and money and that is what lead them to the McSween Turf War.|$|E

500|$|Abrams had {{at first}} been {{concerned}} about casting a Korean-American as a Japanese character, but George Takei reassured him that Sulu had been meant to represent all of Asia on Enterprise, so Abrams went ahead with Cho. Cho acknowledged that being an Asian-American, [...] "there are certain acting roles that you are never going <b>to</b> <b>get,</b> <b>and</b> {{one of them is}} playing a cowboy. [...] is a realization of that dream – going into space." [...] He cited the masculinity of the character as being important to him, and spent two weeks fight training. Although Cho suffered an injury to his wrist during filming, a representative reassured the public that the injury was [...] "no big deal". James Kyson Lee had originally been interested in playing the part of Sulu, but both he and Quinto, who had already been cast as Spock, were at the time members of the cast of the television series Heroes, and its producers told Lee {{they did not want to}} lose another cast member for three months.|$|E
500|$|This simple tactic proved unstoppable. Soon, he had {{surpassed the}} 50-point barrier, causing arena speaker Dave Zinkoff {{to fire up}} the {{previously}} sleepy crowd. Chamberlain also kept his cool despite getting perpetually triple and quadruple-teamed by the Knicks, who did not shy away from hard fouls to distract the center. McGuire was irate and demanded that the referees call more fouls, but Chamberlain could not be stopped. He scored another 28 points to lift his Warriors to a commanding 125–106 lead {{by the end of}} the third quarter. His own total stood at 69, nine shy of his previous scoring record. The Knicks' third center, Dave Budd, who alternated with the foul-troubled Imhoff at pivot, later stated that resistance was futile: [...] "You couldn't play [...] conventionally because he was so big. The only thing you could attempt to do was either front him, and in that case they'd try to lob it in to him, or beat him down the floor and set up where he wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>and</b> force him out a couple of extra steps. The guy weighed 300 or 270 , so that wasn't easy, either." [...] Chamberlain now realized he could break his own 73-point scoring record (for a regulation 48-minute game) or his record 78 points, set in triple overtime.|$|E

500|$|The Guardian and the Evening Times {{highlighted}} the Star Stories parody as the [...] "pick of the day". Martin Skeggs of The Guardian commented, [...] "There's everything you {{ever wanted to}} know about the world's number one film star, including how he was introduced to Scientology (John Travolta whacked him over the head with a shovel), the time he met Nicole Kidman and asked her if she would mind sitting down to make him look taller". He characterized the parody as, [...] "A toned down version of real life, then." [...] Barry McDonald of the Evening Times described the episode as [...] "equally cruel and sidesplittingly hilarious". He commented, [...] "This is as close to must-watch television as you're likely <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>and</b> a testament to the quality of comedy writing on display." [...] In a later review of the program for the Evening Times when it was shown again on re-runs, McDonald wrote, [...] "I don't care if it's been shown several times before, {{this is one of the}} shows which you just have to see again." [...] Anila Baig of The Sun {{highlighted the}} show as [...] "Best Spoof", and wrote, [...] "pint-sized Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise [...] is subjected to some serious mocking. We follow his film career, his marriages to Nicole Kidman and Katie Holmes (portrayed as a robot) and how everything in his life has been shaped by his belief in Scientology. The show is as crude as ever". Stephen Milton of The Sun described the parody of Cruise's appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show as [...] "the best gag in the whole episode". Aidan Smith of Scotland on Sunday wrote favorably of the show, and noted, [...] "Fearlessly, in view of how paranoid Scientologists are, the latest target was Tom Cruise. I especially liked the scene where the tiny screen giant winched himself, Mission Impossible-style, on to Nicole Kidman while she slugged from a tinnie like a good Sheila." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{third and}} final album was again helmed by David Kahne, which Allmusic writer Stewart Mason speculated was a [...] "reaction against the more {{commercial}} sound of Benefactor. By this time, Carter {{had been replaced by}} veteran session drummer Aaron Smith. Instincts was released in October 1984, debuted at No.68 on the Billboard 200, and proved to be the band's best-selling album. It also launched their most successful single, [...] "A Girl in Trouble (Is a Temporary Thing)," [...] which broke the Billboard Top 40 and peaked at No.35. Critical reactions were positive. Despite being the band's most successful effort to date, Columbia pulled the band's promotional support while on a nationwide tour. [...] "The very next town we got to after they made that decision, there wasn't an A person there," [...] said Iyall. [...] " [...] was no local person there, there were no interviews and in-stores arranged as they had been. All that just ground to a halt." [...] Iyall also revealed during that tour that she had signed with her own manager, David Rubinson, and would be leaving the band {{at the end of the}} tour. The band stayed together for a European tour at the beginning of 1985 and upon returning to San Francisco, Iyall quit the band to pursue a solo career. Constant touring has been cited by Iyall as the primary reason for the break-up. [...] "You get tired of each other, and you get intolerant of being uncomfortable and away from your family and your friends." [...] According to a VH1 reunion episode, the issue of Iyall's weight was the reason for the label dropping them. In 2003, Iyall agreed with this claim: [...] "Howie sold us from 415 to Columbia Records, and they were like 'Who's this fat chick?' They decided that was as far as it was going <b>to</b> <b>get,</b> <b>and</b> pulled their support." [...] Crawdaddy! writer Denise Sullivan stated that the label spoke to Iyall about losing weight, but she subsequently refused. In 2010, Iyall declined to discuss the issue, but added that she may not be taking full responsibility in the matter.|$|E
