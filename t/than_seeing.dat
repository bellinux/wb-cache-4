The play left the white audience pitying the character, Tom, rather <b>than</b> <b>seeing</b> him as an equal. Earlier during this play, an actor breaks into a song with lyrics stereotyping mischievous, black children. This play encapsulates the controversy between anti-slavery activists and those pro slavery in the United States.|$|E
25|$|So the {{function}} of satisfaction for Aquinas is not to placate a wrathful God or {{in some other way}} remove the constraints which compel God to damn sinners. Instead, {{the function}} of satisfaction is to restore a sinner to a state of harmony with God by repairing or restoring in the sinner what sin has damaged. This is Aquinas' major difference with Anselm. Rather <b>than</b> <b>seeing</b> the debt as one of honor, he sees the debt as a moral injustice to be righted.|$|E

25|$|In any {{of these}} designs an observer, rather <b>than</b> <b>seeing</b> a {{continuous}} weak light, sees a brighter light during short time intervals. These instants of bright light are arranged to create a light characteristic or, pattern specific to a lighthouse. For example, the Scheveningen Lighthouse flashes are alternately 2.5 and 7.5seconds. Some lights have sectors of a particular color (usually formed by colored panes in the lantern) to distinguish safe water areas from dangerous shoals. Modern lighthouses often have unique reflectors or Racon transponders so the radar signature of the light is also unique.|$|E
25|$|Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, {{commander}} of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front, had already agreed with Joffre that the British would launch wearing-out attacks in 1917, but demanded (6 January) written confirmation of Nivelle’s earlier assurance that if the plan {{did not succeed in}} forcing a general German withdrawal, Nivelle would take over British line to free up British reserves for his planned Flanders offensive. By Edward Spears’ account Nivelle accused Haig of having “une idée fixe” about Flanders and of trying to “hog all the blanket for himself” rather <b>than</b> <b>seeing</b> the front as a whole. David Lloyd George, the British Prime Minister, backed Nivelle because he thought he had “proved himself to be a Man” at Verdun.|$|E
25|$|Due to reality-based expectations, {{fire and}} water were the hardest {{elements}} to effectively bend, {{and because of}} particle work which was unable to be rendered in hardware, earth bending also was difficult to create. With water, the variety in different scales required Helman and his team to create different techniques. The concept for air {{was derived from the}} animation of the television series. To create the air bending effect, visual effects art director Christian Alzman and digital matte department supervisor Barry Williams explained that seeing dust and snow particles, rather <b>than</b> <b>seeing</b> the air itself, helped shape the real world effect of bending the element. Before the bending effects could be applied though, the actor's movements had to be matched; Shyamalan therefore wanted each character's bending styles to be unique to fit with their unique personalities.|$|E

He and Professor Xavier decide that the best solution would be to prevent the Sentinels' creation by stopping Mystique's assassination of Bolivar Trask in 1973. Wolverine's consciousness is sent back to his past self by Kitty Pryde, and his past actions occur simultaneously to an incoming Sentinel attack on the mutant hideout. Magneto destroys many Sentinels by hurling the Blackbird at them but ends up impaled by a stray fragment from a destroyed Sentinel. Retreating into the monastery, Magneto starts to succumb to his wound as he tells Charles he regrets that both friends spent too many years fighting among themselves rather <b>than</b> <b>seeing</b> eye-to-eye. He remains there until the Sentinels infiltrate the stronghold right as young Xavier and Wolverine have successfully changed the future.|$|E
500|$|Cobb was {{convinced}} that Alfred North Whitehead was right in viewing both nature and human beings as more than just purposeless machines. [...] Rather <b>than</b> <b>seeing</b> nature as purely mechanical and human consciousness as a strange exception which must be explained away, Whiteheadian naturalism went {{in the opposite direction}} by arguing that subjective experience of the world should inform a view of the rest of nature as more than just mechanical. In short, nature should be seen as having a subjective and purposive aspect that deserves attention.|$|E

500|$|Process {{theology}} typically stresses God's relational nature. Rather <b>than</b> <b>seeing</b> God as impassive or emotionless, process theologians view God as [...] "the fellow sufferer who understands", and as {{the being}} who is supremely affected by temporal events. [...] Hartshorne points out that people would not praise a human ruler who was unaffected by either the joys or sorrows of his followers – so why would this be a praise-worthy quality in God? [...] Instead, as the being who is most affected by the world, God is the being who can most appropriately respond to the world. [...] However, process theology has been formulated {{in a wide variety}} of ways. [...] C. Robert Mesle, for instance, advocates a [...] "process naturalism", i.e. a process theology without God.|$|E
500|$|Fairy tales {{were often}} found in chapbooks—cheap, {{disposable}} literature—which contained sensational stories such as Jack the Giant Killer along with lewder tales such as How to restore a lost Maidenhead, or solder a Crackt one.

Trimmer criticized the values associated with fairy tales, accusing them of perpetuating irrationality, superstition, and unfavorable images of stepparents. Rather <b>than</b> <b>seeing</b> Trimmer as a censor of fairy tales, therefore, children's literature scholar Nicholas Tucker has argued, [...] "by considering fairy tales as fair game for criticism rather than unthinking worship, Mrs Trimmer is at one with scholars today who have also written critically about the ideologies found in some individual stories".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{attention}} to Dickinson's poetry was meager from 1897 {{to the early}} 1920s. By {{the start of the}} 20th century, interest in her poetry became broader in scope and some critics began to consider Dickinson as essentially modern. Rather <b>than</b> <b>seeing</b> Dickinson's poetic styling as a result of lack of knowledge or skill, modern critics believed the irregularities were consciously artistic. In a 1915 essay, Elizabeth Shepley Sergeant called the poet's inspiration [...] "daring" [...] and named her [...] "one of the rarest flowers the sterner New England land ever bore". With the growing popularity of modernist poetry in the 1920s, Dickinson's failure to conform to 19th-century poetic form was no longer surprising nor distasteful to new generations of readers. Dickinson was suddenly referred to by various critics as a great woman poet, and a cult following began to form.|$|E

500|$|Trimmer {{is perhaps}} most famous now for her {{condemnation}} of fairy tales, such as the various translations of Charles Perrault's Histoires ou contes du temps passé (originally published in 1697), because they endorsed an irrational {{view of the world}} and suggested that children could become successful too easily (in other words, {{they did not have to}} work). Chapbooks were the literature of the poor and Trimmer was attempting to separate children's literature from texts she associated with the lower classes; she also feared that children might gain access to this cheap literature without their parents' knowledge.

500|$|Andrée Hayum {{argues that}} the {{commissioning}} of the tondo by the Doni family helped to emphasize the [...] "secular and domestic ideals" [...] of the painting rather <b>than</b> <b>seeing</b> it as a [...] "devotional object." [...] In choosing a tondo as the format for the picture, Michelangelo is referencing the form’s long association with depicting the [...] "Adoration of the Magi, the Nativity, [...] the Madonna and Child." [...] Hayum also finds many allusions to Noah throughout the work. [...] She posits a referencing of the Madonna to Noah’s daughter-in-law, a sibyl, which thus makes Joseph an embodiment of Noah himself. [...] Hayum further supports this by acknowledging the direct link between Joseph and Noah as depicted in Michelangelo’s Sistine Ceiling paintings. [...] This link to Noah also gives an explanation to the nudes in the background, whose forms may have inspired the sons in the Drunkenness of Noah. [...] The allusion to the Noah story also brings up themes of baptismal water, thus giving rise to {{an interpretation of the}} nudes similar to D’Ancona’s: [...] "catechumens awaiting baptism" [...] from John the Baptist, whose [...] "isolation within a pit-like space" [...] indicates his special role as baptizer.|$|E
