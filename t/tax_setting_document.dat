40|$|Tax {{competition}} is discussed {{as a source}} of inefficiency in international taxation and in fiscal federalism. Two preconditions for the existence of such effects of tax competition are that mobile factors locate or reside in jurisdictions with – ceteris paribus – lower tax rates and that <b>taxes</b> are actually <b>set</b> strategically in order to attract mobile production factors. It is well known from studies about Swiss cantonal and local income tax competition that Swiss taxpayers reside where income taxes are low. In this paper, empirical results on strategic <b>tax</b> <b>setting</b> by cantonal governments are presented for a panel of the Swiss cantons from 1984 to 1999. Completing the evidence on Swiss tax competition, the income tax rates in cantons are lower, the lower the tax rates of their neighbors. tax competition, strategic <b>tax</b> <b>setting,</b> personal income <b>taxes...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} welfare and other {{consequences}} of tax policy {{in a third}} market export model where duopolists located in two countries compete in prices. With tax competition between governments, we allow for welfare-maximizing governments {{in the two countries}} to delegate <b>tax</b> <b>setting</b> responsibility to policy-makers who have different objectives than the governments. The unique equilibrium in the tax competition environment involves both governments delegating <b>tax</b> <b>setting</b> responsibility to <b>tax</b> revenue-maximizing policy-makers. This equilibrium yields higher welfare for both countries than the outcome when the governments delegate to welfare-maximizing policy-makers. The paper also compares tax competition with tax harmonization and shows that when the entire export market is served, tax harmonization improves the welfare of the country that houses the low cost firm, while the other country may be immiserized...|$|R
40|$|This article aims at {{analysing}} simultaneously three potential {{determinants of}} local <b>tax</b> <b>setting</b> by the French departments: {{the tax rate}} choices by the neighbouring departments, demographic and economic local features, and some political determinants, especially the degree of political competition in the local assembly. We estimate for the three main direct local taxes a static model of fiscal choices to determine {{the impact of these}} determinants on the <b>tax</b> <b>setting.</b> We obtain the following results. First, local political variables and tax mimicking behaviour only influence disparities in business tax rates. Second, departmental executives lower their business tax rate when their margin in seats at the local assembly increases, the reduction being smaller with leftwing local majorities than with rightwing local majorities. This result suggests that elected representatives in French departments adopt a partisan behaviour. ...|$|R

We find that the nature of the <b>tax</b> <b>setting</b> outcomes depend crucially on the proximity between cities. For “distant” cities with the same size populations, the pressure on tax rates of a more mobile workforce depends on the whether mobile workers are net beneficiaries or net contributors. If mobile workers are either high or low income earners, cities lower tax rates. If mobile workers are middle income earners, cities raise tax rates. For “close” or neighbouring cities, workers locate in one of the cities and tax rates and local public amenities are dispersed.

40|$|The {{identification}} of strategic interactions among local governments is typically plagued by endogeneity problems. This paper proposes a quasi-experimental strategy to identify independent personal income <b>tax</b> <b>setting</b> by Swiss municipalities {{making use of}} the multi-tier federal system. State (cantonal) borders spatially bound the effects of canton-level fiscal reforms {{in areas that are}} otherwise highly integrated. Fiscal reforms at the canton level provide an exogenous source of variation in municipal tax rates, and are thus a valid instrument to identify strategic interactions among municipalities located at a cantonal border. In contrast to most of the existing empirical literature, I find that tax reaction functions have a negative slope and that taxes rates are strategic substitutes rather than strategic complements. This is compatible with a model of local <b>tax</b> <b>setting</b> in which governments primarily target expenditure rather than tax receipts.
