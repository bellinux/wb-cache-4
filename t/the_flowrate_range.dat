Air with a uniform velocity profile flowed through a duct with cross-section of 0. 15 × 0. 60 m. A stream of sand particles, with a mean diameter of 204 μm and density of 2640 kg/m 3, was fed into the duct from above to form a curtain across the entire width of the duct. <b>The</b> particle <b>flowrates</b> <b>ranged</b> from 0. 031 to 0. 047 kg/s.

In an experimental study, the trajectory of the particle curtain was tracked using high-speed video camera and the velocity profile of the air downstream of the curtain was measured using a pitot tube. The fluid dynamic behaviour of the particle curtain was analysed using a Eulerian–Eulerian computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model that is capable of predicting the complete flow fields of the gas and particles. Also, a simple single particle model was used to predict the particle velocity at the centerline and trajectories of the leading and trailing edges of the particle curtains falling in a horizontal air flow. Good agreement was found between the experiments and the CFD model predictions. However, predictions from the simple single particle model were less satisfactory due primarily to the non-uniform gas flow found in practice, compared to the assumed uniform flow...|$|R

40|$|The {{gravity flow}} of bulk solids from mass flow bins and hoppers {{is a subject}} of {{considerable}} practical and theoretical interest Many published papers have brought greater understanding of <b>the</b> <b>flowrate</b> of coarse particles. Research on finer materials was insufficient due to imprecise predictions of the air pressure gradient at the hopper outlet, {{which is a very}} important factor in predicting <b>the</b> <b>flowrate</b> of <b>the</b> fine particles. The work in this thesis develops theoretical models for predicting the interstitial air pressure gradient and for predicting <b>the</b> <b>flowrate</b> of bulk solids from conical mass flow bins. The theoretical models are based on the continuum mechanics theory. The boundary conditions follow air pressure and bulk density continuity in a vertical direction. A close agreement between theoretical results and experimental results was obtained for predicting both flowrate and air pressure distribution. Both theoretical and experimental results indicate that <b>the</b> <b>flowrate</b> of free flowing bulk solids increases rapidly at first and then more gradually as the particle permeability constant increases. The use of 2 ̆ 7 permeability 2 ̆ 7 enables the theories developed to be applied in describing the flow behaviour of both coarse and fine particle mixtures as well as composite particle size-distributed bulk solids. The use of consolidation-related bulk density and permeability enables the theoretical models to be applied to both compressible and incompressible materials.

In this work, we develop dynamic models for tray and packed absorbers that predict <b>the</b> transient <b>flowrate</b> and pressure during concentrated absorption. The models have separate material balances for each phase and are non-isothermal, account for solvent evaporation, and predict transient hydraulic behavior. We study the aqueous absorption of gaseous HCl and NH 3. ^ The equilibrium sieve-tray model predicts large decreases in <b>the</b> gas <b>flowrate</b> during startup which triggers excessive transient weeping. Steady-state weeping is suppressed by solvent evaporation in adiabatic columns with hot liquid feed, but manifests in colder columns. Using two half-steps in succession {{instead of one}} large concentration step reduces transient weeping. ^ During the transition to standby operation, the influx of inert gas causes solute desorption and solvent evaporation which result in large spikes in <b>the</b> gas <b>flowrates</b> and pressure. Switching from pure HCl to pure N 2 results in a peak exit gas flowrate that is five times <b>the</b> inlet <b>flowrate,</b> causing excessive entrainment. Peak solute loss in the vent gas is five times the acceptable limit. Decreasing <b>the</b> inert <b>flowrate</b> after <b>the</b> step improves transient behavior. ^ The non-equilibrium packed absorber model also predicts large decreases in <b>the</b> gas <b>flowrate</b> during startup for both random and structured packing. However, packed columns are stable at low flowrates and do not weep or dump liquid like tray columns, and therefore, perform better at startup. ^ The model predicts solute accumulation in the bulk gas and delayed solvent evaporation during startup, causing a small spike in the gas compositions. At low mass-transfer rates, the spike causes excessive solute losses in the vent. ^ During the transition to standby operation, <b>the</b> peak gas <b>flowrates</b> are 3 – 5 times the feed gas rate, and the peak pressure drops are 20 – 30 times the flooding values.

For <b>the</b> <b>flowrate</b> measurement, <b>the</b> shaft of the material blower and the drive shaft of the base unit powering the cutterhead, feedrolls and front attachement, were instrumented with strain gauge torque transducers. Within the calibration range, the signals of these sensors showed a linear relationship to <b>the</b> <b>flowrate.</b> <b>The</b> harvester was also equipped with a speed radar and a data acquisition system based on a personal computer. The location tracking of the machine was done by integrating the machine speed and manual recording of the machine path in the field. The construction of a yield map, from the recorded signals, included several digital signal processing operations. The resulting map of a 1 · 2 ha corn silage hield showed spatial yield variation from 1 · 2 to 4 · 8 kg/m 2 with average of 3 · 2 kg/m 2 and standard deviation of 0 · 64 kg/m 2. status: publishe...|$|R
