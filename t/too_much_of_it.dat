I think we make far <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> After all, one's genitals are just one important part of the magnificent human body ... I contend that SEX IS SEX and LOVE IS LOVE. When combined, they work well together, if two people are of about the same mind. But they are really two discrete needs and should be treated as such. Time and space will not permit me to expound further, especially {{in the area of the}} psyche. I don't believe in overly moralistic philosophies. Have your sex, it can be exciting, if you're lucky.

In addition, he sings about the girl's many characteristics and sensual qualities, and proclaims that he will love her until they [...] "make it pop". The Boston Globes James Reed wrote that the lyrics are silly, but irresistible, while Sarah Dean of The Huffington Post found [...] "Strawberry Bubblegum" [...] as seductive as its title, but according to her, [...] "if you had <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> you might end up feeling a little sick".

The church scene with Charlie and Liam at the church in Manchester was actually filmed on Honolulu, where the scenes on the Island are filmed. Monaghan says that he feels Charlie's black hoodie {{is a sort of}} [...] "security blanket" [...] that he hides underneath and uses it when he feels [...] "lost." [...] The [...] "heroin" [...] that Charlie is supposedly snorting is actually brown sugar. Monaghan revealed this in an interview with Stuff magazine in October 2005, saying, [...] " [...] brown sugar. You get some really sweet boogers.

500|$|Burroughs {{continued}} to publicly disagree with Long and his allies, {{and a number}} of his essays dedicated to [...] "sham nature history" [...] were collected in the volume Ways of Nature, published in late 1905. Admitting that his authorial tone had changed since 1903, he wrote in the preface that [...] "My readers will find this volume quite a departure in certain ways from the tone and spirit of my previous books, especially in regard to the subject of animal intelligence. Heretofore I have made the most of every gleam of intelligence of bird or four-footed beast that came under my observation, often, I fancy, making <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and giving the wild creatures credit for more 'sense' than they really possessed." [...] Mabel Osgood Wright weighed in on the debate in a 1905 essay titled [...] "Nature as a Field for Fiction", in which she criticized both sides. Believing that nature writing could imbue animal characters with human qualities in order to better connect with the reader on an emotional level, Wright argued that nature writing should nonetheless strive to be factual and not fantastical.|$|E
500|$|Whyte {{stated that}} he began working on the album in [...] "2008 maybe" [...] and worked {{on it for a}} two-year period. Glass Swords was {{recorded}} in Whyte's father's house in Glasgow and in his home in London after Whyte had moved there. The album's music was developed with Whyte not having a strong idea for it, noting that he was [...] "just making tracks and not really thinking <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as being an album". The album was created using Ableton on a personal computer along with a midi guitar controller, a midi keyboard, keyboard, electric guitar and a microphone. To give the album an analogue sound, Whyte used compressors and tape distortion plugins to get the tracks what he described as a [...] "sort of warmth". Vocals on the album were done by Whyte on the track [...] "Surph" [...] while his girlfriend Nightwave performed some of the backing vocals. Whyte described his music as trying to channel [...] "good energy, just love and peace and happiness and joy. That's what I want from my music, and that's what I want other people to feel." ...|$|E
500|$|Anime News Network's reviewers found much {{to enjoy}} {{about the first}} series, {{although}} Theron Martin warns that the first DVD should be [...] "watched in small doses, as trying to tackle <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in one sitting will elevate the suicide rate of your brain cells". Carl Kimlinger comments that [...] "from the moment the words 'School Rumble' come spinning onto the screen, you know you're in for ... undiluted good times", and that the title is [...] "two of the greatest animation non-sequiturs you're likely to see anytime soon". Carlo Santos praises volume six's bizarre comedy, but laments its romantic elements as being too generic. Overall, his rating is mediocre, saying that [...] "although this disc technically {{marks the end of}} [...] School Rumble, it's really more of a pause, seeing as how the last few episodes simply ride along with the plot rather than try to reach a dramatic finish". Reviewers from Mania.com followed this pattern; Dani Moure was skeptical of the series' long-term entertainment value, but like fellow reviewer Danielle Van Gorder, found his early indifference fading as the story develops. IGN's Jeff Harris, N.S. Davidson, and David F. Smith gave mostly positive reviews, although Davidson believes the audio and extras had begun to wane by volume five. Jakub Lhota of Reanimated rated the first season an 8/10, stating that he enjoyed it more than some other anime series he had previously watched, and the style—if not always the color—of Funimation's metallic locker artbox for School Rumbles English translation of the first season was welcomed.|$|E

2500|$|In medicine, {{phosphate}} deficiency syndrome {{may be caused}} by malnutrition, by failure to absorb phosphate, and by metabolic syndromes that draw phosphate from the blood (such as in [...] refeeding syndrome after malnutrition) or pass <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> into the urine. All are characterised by hypophosphatemia, which is a condition of low levels of soluble phosphate levels in the blood serum and inside the cells. Symptoms of hypophosphatemia include neurological dysfunction and disruption of muscle and blood cells due to lack of ATP. Too much phosphate can lead to diarrhoea and calcification (hardening) of organs and soft tissue, and can interfere with the body's ability to use iron, calcium, magnesium, and zinc.|$|E
2500|$|BBC {{diplomatic}} correspondent Bridget Kendall in her 2007 article, after {{describing the}} [...] "scarred decade" [...] of the 1990s with [...] "rampant hyperinflation", harsh Yeltsin's policies, population decrease rate {{like that for}} a nation in a war, the country turning [...] "from superpower into beggar", wonders: [...] "So who can blame Russians for welcoming the relative stability Putin has presided over during the past seven years, even if other aspects of his rule have cast an authoritarian shadow? In the back-to-front world of Russian politics, it is not too little democracy that many people fear, but <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> This, I discovered, is why some are calling for Putin to stay on for a third term. Not because they admire him—privately, many say that he and his cronies are just as corrupt and disdainful of others as their communist predecessors were—but because they mistrust the idea of democracy, resent the West for pushing it, and fear what might happen as a result of next year's elections. Recent experience has taught them that change is usually for the worse and best avoided." ...|$|E

2500|$|The spell {{itself and}} its {{consequences}} are certainly less easy to work out effectively than {{was the case with}} the famous spell in The Sorcerer.... After this the fun soon becomes fast and furious — too furious to be in our judgment characteristic of the author's happiest manner. [...] There is certainly a good deal of drollery in Foggerty's interview with Malvina de Vere, and their friendly steps towards an action for breach of promise. [...] But there is almost <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and there is certainly too much of the satire upon mad-doctors and their ways which occurs when Foggerty's friends believe him demented, and try to get a certificate to that effect from Dr. Lobb and Dr. Dobb. The climax, therefore, which is brought about when the hero takes a pill, summons the fairy once more, and brings matters back to their status quo, is very welcome, for towards the last the fun is felt to be flagging. [...] The mad dream has been almost too long as well as too elaborate in its absurdities. [...] This fault, if it be found to exist, can, of course, be readily remedied, as there seems no real need for the hero's false confession, à la Topsy, of a crime which he never committed.|$|E
2500|$|Moreover, the Savoy was not {{the right}} place to produce such a drama, because its {{audience}} was used to seeing comic operas focused on wit, humour and Gilbertian satire. [...] To provide them with a mostly dark-toned romantic piece consisting of pseudo-medieval dialogue (and <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it),</b> lengthy grand-operatic musical numbers and a serious exploration of complex characters {{turned out to be a}} grave mistake. [...] In addition, The Beauty Stone is a very long piece [...] it played for nearly four hours on opening night; several items were cut soon after opening night, but the cuts did not improve matters. [...] At the same time, competition from the new theatrical art form of George Edwardes-style musical comedy produced at other London theatres offered lighthearted entertainment choices to the Savoy audience, with catchy tunes, dancing and witty banter. [...] For a modern audience, however, there is much to admire about The Beauty Stone. [...] Pinero's book, though overly long, contains vivid characters with psychological depth that Sullivan was able to develop more fully than in his shorter comic operas. The complex way in which these characters react to the beauty stone makes this plot device different from the way Gilbert treated his magic lozenges and gave Sullivan a chance to employ rich musical portraits of yearning, despair, love and beauty.|$|E
2500|$|Nazi {{approval}} of Braemer was not universal, however. During {{his tenure as}} the Wehrmachtbefehlshaber or territorial military commander of the Reichskommissariat Ostland, Braemer had (presumably) an immediate superior {{in the person of}} Reichskommissar (and Gauleiter) Hinrich Lohse, the overall governor of the Ostland who was likewise headquartered in Riga, Latvia. [...] While Lohse's slapping of Braemer on the face [...] in public [...] at the Riga Opera House during the banquet celebrating Hitler's birthday on 20April 1944 probably should not be made <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of,</b> <b>it</b> is indicative nonetheless of the tensions simmering within the Nazi leadership in the Ostland and points at least to the possibility that even to high-ranking (but non-Wehrmacht and non-SS) Nazis like Lohse the methods used by Braemer in the implementation of the Holocaust might have seemed objectionable (if only on economic grounds, by depriving his administration of needed workforce), even if the event has also been put down to the incipient panic in the face of looming defeat or to personal rivalries between two Nazi apparatchiks vying for a position of pre-eminence within the Ostland bureaucracy. In some reports the punch from Lohse (meted out in response to Braemer's applying to Lohse the unparliamentary epithet of dummes Luder [...] "silly rotter") is said literally to have knocked Braemer to the ground. But the knockout blow appears to have been invested with figurative significance as well, as the incident marks Braemer's exit from the scene in Riga (on orders from the Wehrmacht which removed him that very day not only from the commandership of the Ostland but from active duty altogether) and, conversely, his promotion by the SS to the aforementioned higher rank of gruppenführer on the same day. Braemer was 61-years' old at the time.|$|E
