The main characteristics of these oils are large total phenol content, low acidity and peroxide values, low oxidative susceptibilities. All the chemical parameters fell within the limits established for the maximum olive oil category. Sensory evaluation showed that the total score of all the monovarietal extra virgin olive oils was always much higher than the 6. 5 limit established for the 'extra-virgin' category. The overall quality indices support claims of excellence for monovarietal EVOOs from this geographical area.

40|$|International audienceAbstractForeknowledge about {{sugarcane}} crop size {{can help}} industry members make more informed decisions. There exists many {{different combinations of}} climate variables, seasonal climate prediction indices, and crop model outputs that could prove useful in explaining sugarcane crop size. A data mining method like random forests can cope with generating a prediction model when the search space of predictor variables is large. Research that has investigated the accuracy of random forests to explain annual variation in sugarcane productivity and the suitability of predictor variables generated from crop models coupled with observed climate and seasonal climate prediction indices is limited. Simulated biomass from the APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator) sugarcane crop model, seasonal climate prediction indices and observed rainfall, maximum and minimum temperature, and radiation were supplied as inputs to a random forest classifier and a random forest regression model to explain annual variation in regional sugarcane yields at Tully, in northeastern Australia. Prediction models were generated on 1 September {{in the year before}} harvest, and then on 1 January and 1 March in <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>harvest,</b> which typically runs from June to November. Our results indicated that in 86. 36  % of years, it was possible to determine as early as September in the year before harvest if production would be above the median. This accuracy improved to 95. 45  % by January in <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>harvest.</b> The R-squared of the random forest regression model gradually improved from 66. 76 to 79. 21  % from September in the year before harvest through to March in the same year of harvest.

40|$|Emissions of {{greenhouse}} gases is accounted for and reported annually under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto protocol. In the current accounting system, emissions of CO 2 from harvested wood products (HWP) are attributed to <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>harvest</b> and the country of harvest. All harvested wood is thus assumed to be oxidised to CO 2 {{in the year of}} harvesting, and no wood goes into long term storage. This is called the IPCC default approach. Much of the harvested wood will however be stored for a short or long period of time before it oxidises and this will cause a delayed emission of CO 2. If more wood is stored than oxidised in a given year, harvested wood products will act as a sink and a removal of CO 2 is recorded. However, if the consumption of wood decreases to a level below what is oxidised, harvested wood products will act as a source and emissions of CO 2 is recorded. In Norway, as on many other countries, the stock of harvested wood products has been increasing for many years, and is likely to increase further.

40|$|A short {{rotation}} coppice (SRC) with poplar {{was established}} in a randomised fertilisation experiment on sandy loam soil in Potsdam (Northeast Germany). The main objective {{of this study was}} to assess if negative environmental effects as nitrogen leaching and greenhouse gas emissions are enhanced by mineral nitrogen (N) fertiliser applied to poplar at rates of 0, 50 and 75 kg N ha− 1 year− 1 and how these effects are influenced by tree age with increasing number of rotation periods and cycles of organic matter decomposition and tree growth after each harvesting event. Between 2008 and 2012, the leaching of nitrate (NO 3 −) was monitored with self-integrating accumulators over 6 -month periods and the emissions of the greenhouse gases (GHG) nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) were determined in closed gas chambers. During <b>the</b> first 4 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poplar SRC, most nitrogen was lost through NO 3 − leaching from the main root zone; however, there was no significant relationship to the rate of N fertilisation. On average, 5. 8 kg N ha− 1 year− 1 (13. 0 kg CO 2 equ) was leached from the root zone. Nitrogen leaching rates decreased in the course of the 4 -year study parallel to an increase of the fine root biomass and the degree of mycorrhization. In contrast to N leaching, the loss of nitrogen by N 2 O emissions from the soil was very low with an average of 0. 61 kg N ha− 1 year− 1 (182 kg CO 2 equ) and were also not affected by N fertilisation over the whole study period.

The key factors influencing the variation in cane yield and commercial cane sugar in this commercial environment were identified and the variance components computed using a restricted maximum likelihood methodology. Cane yield was predominantly influenced by the year in which it was harvested, the month when the crop was ratooned (month of harvest in the previous year) and the farm of origin. These variables were relatively more important than variety, age of crop or crop class (plant crop, first ratoon through to fourth or older ratoons) and fallowing practice (fallow or ploughout-replant). The month-of-ratooning effect was relatively stable from year-to-year. Commercial cane sugar was influenced by <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>harvest,</b> the month of harvest and their interaction, in that the influence of the month of harvest varied from year to year.

Most of these produce microscopic propagules of about 10 μm that can disperse over large distances by way of various vectors, from wind to mycophagous animals. Animals are often drawn to hypogeous fruiting bodies because they are rich in nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, minerals and vitamins. However, some sources state these nutritive properties are overstated, and {{it is more likely}} due to availability at specific times <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> and ease <b>of</b> <b>harvest.</b>|$|R
