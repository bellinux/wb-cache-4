25|$|Electric {{traction}} {{was introduced}} in 1905 with electric multiple units operating between Uxbridge, Harrow-on-the-Hill and Baker Street. To remove steam and smoke from the tunnels in central London, the railway purchased electric locomotives, exchanged for steam locomotives at Harrow from 1908. In 1910, a seventeen-minute silent film recording was made showing large portions of the journey from Baker Street to Aylesbury and Uxbridge, seen from <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> <b>of</b> a train.

25|$|In the US, {{vehicles}} over 2,032mm (80inches) wide must {{be equipped}} with three amber front and three red rear identification lamps spaced between 6 and 12inches apart {{at the center of}} the front and rear of the vehicle, as high as practicable. The front identification lamps are typically mounted atop <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> <b>of</b> vehicles. The purpose of these lamps is to alert other drivers to the presence of a wide (and usually, tall) vehicle. This type of identification lamp can also be found on road trains in Australia.|$|E

Concern about crime at the station led Metro to station additional transit police officers at Anacostia station {{in the weeks after}} the station's opening, and D.C. police patrolled the station's parking garage. Fear of crime {{was one of the reasons}} why Prince George's County residents fought bus route changes in 1991 which would have forced riders to disembark at Anacostia station.|$|E

25|$|It was Tur's live {{reports that}} led to Denny being rescued by local black civilian, Bobby Green Jr. of South Central Los Angeles.

Upon arriving, he found Denny had climbed back into <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> <b>of</b> his truck and was attempting to drive away, {{but was unable to}} go far because he was drifting in and out of consciousness. Green moved Denny out of the driver's seat and drove him to Daniel Freeman Hospital in Inglewood. Upon arriving at the hospital Denny went into a seizure.|$|E
25|$|Upon arrival, the sheriff's deputies {{sealed off}} the spring with crime-scene tape. Ben's tanks, wet suit and other diving {{equipment}} were not present {{and there were}} no signs of a struggle near his truck or anywhere else he could have been. His wallet, with almost $700 in cash, and cell phone were in <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> <b>of</b> his truck; dive logs showed that he had explored the cave and a map he made was also found. At the Santa Rosa Beach house officers found his dog, hungry from having been unfed for two days. Based on these circumstances, police and dive shop employees assumed that he had never resurfaced and had in all probability drowned somewhere in the cave trying to get out. Cadaver dogs alerted on the water surface, further supporting that theory.|$|E
25|$|West Palm Beach Fire Rescue {{responded to}} the call and found 53-year-old Jorge Barahona {{on the ground and}} 10-year-old Victor Barahona in <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> <b>of</b> the truck. Both were {{conscious}} by the time rescuers arrived, but Victor was convulsing with seizures. One fireman was overcome by a strong smell when approaching the truck, and decontamination procedures were started. The bed of the truck was full of plastic containers of chemicals; some unlabeled. The truck was branded with the name of Jorge's pest extermination business, CJ Pest Control, causing investigators to believe the chemicals were pesticides. One unlabeled container held some form of acid, causing firefighters to wonder why an exterminator would have such a chemical. State Troopers were sent to the address of CJ Pest Control, but were unable to contact anyone.|$|E
40|$|There the {{mathematical}} model of heat exchange in <b>the</b> <b>cabs</b> <b>of</b> timber machines, which were equipped by the thermal protection {{and by the}} stabilization system of temperature, has been developed.

The field of cooler characteristics for <b>the</b> <b>cabs</b> <b>of</b> timber machines has been obtained. The developed air conditioning system allows to improve the working conditions of operator, which promote the rise of labour productivity up to 10 - 12 % in one's turn.

25|$|The Budd Rail Diesel Car, RDC or Buddliner is a {{self-propelled}} diesel {{multiple unit}} (DMU) railcar. Between 1949 and 1962, 398 RDCs were built by the Budd Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. The cars were primarily adopted for passenger service in rural areas with low traffic density or in short-haul commuter service, and were less expensive to operate in this context than a traditional diesel locomotive-drawn train with coaches. The cars could be used singly or several could be coupled together in train sets and controlled from <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> <b>of</b> the front unit. The RDC {{was one of the}} few DMU trains to achieve commercial success in North America. RDC trains were an early example of self-contained {{diesel multiple unit}} trains, an arrangement now in common use by railways all over the world.|$|E
25|$|Truck drivers often {{spend their}} nights parked at a truck stop, rest area, {{or on the}} {{shoulder}} of a freeway ramp. Sometimes these are in secluded areas or dangerous neighborhoods, which account for a number of deaths due to drivers being targeted by thieves for their valuable cargo, money, and property, or for the truck and trailer themselves. Drivers of trucks towing flatbed trailers are responsible for securing and strapping down their cargo (which often involves climbing onto the cargo itself), and if the load requires tarping necessitates climbing on the load to spread out tarps. Tarps can weigh up to 200lbs each and the cargo can require up to 3 tarps per load which account for a number of deaths and injuries from falling. Drivers spend long hours behind the wheel, which can cause strain on the back muscles. Some drivers are responsible for unloading their cargo, which can lead to many back strains and sprains due to overexertion and improper lifting techniques. If <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> <b>of</b> the truck is not appropriate for the driver's size, the driver can lose visibility and easy access to the controls and be at higher risk for accidents.|$|E
25|$|Most {{truck drivers}} are {{employed}} as over-the-road drivers, meaning they are hired to drive long distances {{from the place}} of pickup {{to the place of}} delivery. During the short times while they are in heavily polluted urban areas, being inside <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> <b>of</b> the truck contributes much to avoiding the inhalation of toxic emissions, and on the majority of the trip, while they are passing through vast rural areas where there is little air pollution, truck drivers in general enjoy less exposure to toxic emissions in the air than the inhabitants of large cities, where there is an increased exposure to emissions from engines, factories, etc., which may increase the risk of cancer and can aggravate certain lung diseases, such as asthma in the general public who inhabit these cities. However, the few drivers who are hired to drive only within urban areas do not have this advantage of spending more time away from toxic emissions that is enjoyed by over-the-road drivers. Other conditions affecting the health of truck drivers are for example vibration, noise, long periods of sitting, work stress and exhaustion. For drivers in developing countries there are additional risks because roads are in appalling conditions and accidents occur more frequently. Truck drivers are even a high-risk group for HIV-infection in those countries.|$|E
40|$|There the {{operating}} modes air-coolers in <b>the</b> <b>cabs</b> <b>of</b> agricultural vehicles have been considered. The {{purpose is to}} improve the labour conditions <b>of</b> operators in <b>the</b> <b>cabs</b> <b>of</b> agricultural vehicles by way of normalization of temperature-humidity modes of working zone. The operating conditions of water-evaporating coolers have been substantiated. The mathematical simulators of physical processes taking place in the coolers have been constructed and have been realized numerically. The optimization method <b>of</b> dimensions <b>of</b> <b>cab</b> coolers has been developed. The systematic approach to the choice <b>of</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>cab</b> coolers <b>of</b> vehicles has been offered. The prototypes of air-coolers <b>of</b> tractor <b>cabs</b> have been constructed with the application of computer simulation. The software package, the cooler prototypes have been introduced at the Tashkent Tractor Works.
