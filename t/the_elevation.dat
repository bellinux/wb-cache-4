5|$|After {{the death}} of King Henry in 1189, the new King Richard I {{appointed}} Walter Bishop of Salisbury; the election took place on 15 September 1189 at Pipewell, with the consecration on 22 October 1189 at Westminster. Also elected to bishoprics at this council were Godfrey de Lucy to the see of Winchester, Richard FitzNeal to the see of London, and William Longchamp to the see of Ely. <b>The</b> <b>elevation</b> of so many new bishops was probably meant to signal the new king's break with his father's habit of keeping bishoprics empty to retain the revenues of the sees. At {{about the same time}} Glanvill was either forced out of his justiciarship or resigned, but the sources are unclear. Walter was probably elevated to a bishopric even though his uncle had lost some of his power because of political manoeuvring over <b>the</b> <b>elevation</b> of King Richard's illegitimate half-brother Geoffrey to the see of York, which Walter had at first opposed. The bishopric was either a reward or a bribe for Walter's withdrawal of his objections to Geoffrey's election.|$|E

5|$|In the {{two centuries}} since the hurricane, the oceans rose about , the {{wetlands}} around New Orleans have diminished, and <b>the</b> <b>elevation</b> has dropped due to subsidence.

The 1812 hurricane was not a worst-case scenario for New Orleans, as a stronger and larger hurricane would have caused more damage. If the storm struck in 2012, one researcher estimated the hurricane would have been among the costliest Louisiana hurricanes, comparable to Hurricane Betsy in 1965 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005.|$|E

By marrying Vespasia Polla he allied the Flavian family to the more prestigious gens Vespasia, ensuring <b>the</b> <b>elevation</b> of his sons Titus Flavius Sabinus II and Vespasian to senatorial rank.|$|E
5|$|On 12 September 1920, Haruna was {{involved}} in gunnery drills off Hokkaidō when a breech explosion destroyed the starboard gun of the No.1 turret, killing seven men and badly damaging the armored roof of the turret. A later investigation by the Imperial Japanese Navy concluded that a faulty fuse ignited the gunpowder bags in the breech, detonating the shell while still in the barrel. The turret was repaired at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, where <b>the</b> <b>elevation</b> of her 14-inch guns was also increased by seven degrees. Three months later, she was once again placed in reserve.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{telescope}} was originally completed, Lovell and Husband started contemplating {{the idea of}} upgrading the telescope so {{that it had a}} more accurate surface, and was controlled by a digital computer. Plans for this upgrade were created by Husband and Co., and were presented to Lovell in April 1964. Their plans became more urgent when fatigue cracks were discovered in <b>the</b> <b>elevation</b> drive system in September 1967. The telescope was only expected to have an operational lifespan of 10 years, and Husband had been warning about the decay of the telescope since 1963. The appearance of fatigue cracks was the first of these problems that threatened to stop the telescope working; if tey had not been put right, then <b>the</b> <b>elevation</b> system could have failed and perhaps jammed. The telescope was therefore repaired and upgraded to become the Mark IA; the £400,000 of funding to do this was announced on 8 July 1968 by the SRC. The upgrade was carried out in three phases, phase 1 lasting between September 1968 and February 1969, phase 2 between September and November 1969 and phase 3 between August 1970 and November 1971.|$|E
5|$|Terrain {{played a}} {{significant}} role in operations around Narva. <b>The</b> <b>elevation</b> above sea level rarely rises above 100 meters in the area and the land is cut by numerous waterways, including the Narva and Plyussa Rivers. The bulk of the land in the region is forested and large swamps inundate areas of low elevation. The effect of the terrain on operations was one of channelization; because of the swamps, only certain areas were suitable for large-scale troop movement.|$|E
