Particular {{attention is paid to}} the arbitrage and the spread in triangular foreign exchange trades. There is only one possible triangle when a bilateral exchange rate equals its trilateral rate. Otherwise, any third currency would potentially create arbitrage opportunities. Empirical testing evidence supports that small but possibly exploitable profitable arbitrage has significantly occurred over the very short haul of uncertainty and turbulence. In other words, we are convinced that the bilateral exchange rate could be diverged from one common currency side of the trilateral basket rates until markets function efficiently. This helps in better explaining foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, we find that the currency correlating decreases slightly but the volatility increases over time, as we expected. ...|$|R

Then, to focus the discussion, we examine specifically how TAO implements this feature. 3. 2. 1 Collaborations Between ORB Components for Asynchronous Invocation After an OMG IDL compiler generates the AMI callback stubs, the generated code must collaborate with internal ORB components to send and receive asynchronous invocations. To demonstrate how this works, Figure 4 depicts the general sequence of steps involved when an asynchronous <b>two-way</b> get <b>quote</b> operation is executed. 2 As shown in this figFigure 4 : Interactions Between Client ORB Components for Asynchronous Invocation ure, the interactions between client ORB components for asynchronous invocation consist of the following steps: ffl The [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Ph. D. (Economics) As {{the title}} suggests, the {{objective}} of this thesis has been {{to examine the relationship between}} the physical and futures markets for gold. At the end of the 'sixties, when gold was almost completely phased out of the international monetary system, one of the major consequences was the establishment of a twotier market for newly mined gold. The need became apparent immediately for a free market for the metal to be established on a global basis. The development of this market was hampered, however, by the general belief that the international monetary system would have no alternative but to restore the international monetary role of the metal, as well as by the fact that the citizens of many countries were not allowed to own gold. Moreover, the relationship between supply and demand on the new market was rendered very uncertain by the complicated stockflow relationship of gold, and especially by questions concerning the possible role of the large quantities of gold that were stored in the vaults of central banks and other official institutions. Around 1974, when the physical market for gold had become more well-established, entrepreneurs in the USA commenced futures trading in gold as a new venture in Comex operations, where futures trading had already been in practice for over a hundred years. Comex became established as the centre of the emerging international marketplace for gold. Chapter II outlines those characteristics of the international monetary system that still relate to the role of gold as a monetary commodity, the object being to obtain a clear picture of the supply and demand relationships involved. In Chapter III the characteristics, organisation and functioning of the physical market for gold. are outlined, while Chapter IV is devoted to a similar examination of the futures market. Chapter V represents an attempt to build a bridge between the phenomena described in the previous two chapters. In a comparison of the two markets it appeared that the physical market provided much more sophistication in customized service, while the futures market offered the participants, i. e. investors and speculators, regulatory safeguards that may be of more importance to them. The critical difference between the physical and futures markets was found to lie in the fact that futures market participants are not required to <b>quote</b> <b>two-way</b> prices, whereas those in the physical market have to be ready to <b>quote</b> <b>two-way</b> prices at any time [...] ...|$|R
