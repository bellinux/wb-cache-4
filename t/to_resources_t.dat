40|$|This study {{examined}} the impact of perceived environmental uncertainty and strategic agility on the perceived performance of selected banks in Oyo State of Nigeria. The study aimed at determining the main and interactive effect of perceived market turbulence, competitive intensity, strategic sensitivity, leadership unity and resource fluidity on organizational performance. It also looked at the connection between perceived environmental uncertainty variables(perceived market turbulence and competitive intensity) as well as strategic agility variables(strategic sensitivity, leadership unity and resource fluidity) and organizational performance. Four hypotheses were formulated and tested using Multiple Analysis of Variance (MANOVA), Canonical Correlation and Multiple Regression. The findings showed that the independent variables (perceived market turbulence, competitive intensity, strategic sensitivity, leadership unity and resource fluidity) were predictors of organizational performance. The study also established a significant positive relationship between perceived environmental uncertainty variables as well as strategic agility variables and organizational performance. Based on the findings, it was recommended {{that there is a}} need for organizations especially banks to understand the dimensions and nature of environmental uncertainty and evolve appropriate strategies to deal or cope with the uncertainty. Organizations should also be strategically agile by making concerted efforts <b>to</b> deploy <b>resources</b> <b>t...</b>|$|R
40|$|The monitor concept {{provides}} a structured and flexible high-level programming construct to control concurrent accesses <b>to</b> shared <b>resources.</b> I <b>t</b> {{has been widely}} used in a concurrent programming environment for implicitly ensuring mutual exclusion and explicitly achieving process synchronization. This paper proposes an extension to the monitor construct for detecting run time errors in monitor operations. Monitors are studied and classified according to their functional characteristics. A taxonomy of concurrency control faults over a monitor is then defined. The concepts of a monitor event sequence and a monitor state sequence provide a uniform approach to history information recording and fault detection. Rules for detecting various types of faults are defined. Based on these rules, fault detection algorithms are developed. A protorypical implementation of the proposed monitor construct with run-time fault detection mechanisms has been developed in Java.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{identify}} the second of two targets (T 2) is impaired if that target is presented less than ∼ 500 ms after the first (T 1). This transient deficit is known as attentional blink (AB). Previous {{studies have suggested that}} the magnitude of the AB effect can be modulated by manipulating the allocation of attentional <b>resources</b> <b>to</b> <b>T</b> 1 or T 2. However, few experiments have used Chinese characters and words to explore this phenomenon. The existence of lexical, semantic, phonological and morphological connections between Chinese characters has been well established, and understanding these connections may improve our knowledge of reading Chinese. In this study, we employed varying connections between T 1 and T 2 and examined how these connections modulate the AB effect. We found that the strongest AB was observed when the two Chinese characters were completely unrelated, while the AB was reduced when T 1 and T 2 were phonologically, orthographically or semantically related and was almost completely eliminated when T 1 and T 2 were united in a lexical phrase. The order of activation between Chinese characters was identified as follows: (a) lexical phrases, (b) semantic connection, (c) morphological connection, (d) phonological connection and (e) unrelated words...|$|R

40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comBiogenic habitats have profound effects on the distribution and abundances of many organisms. Epibiota are major biogenic components of hard substrata in marine habitats, particularly on artificial structures such as pier pilings, and have the potential to influence organisms associated with these structures. This study tested hypotheses about effects of epibiota on abundances of fishes associated with pilings in Middle Harbour, Sydney. Amount of epibiota had no effect on abundances of most species of fish, suggesting that epibiota are not important resources for these species. Abundances of the hulafish, Trachinops taeniatus, were, however, found to be greater around pilings with large than pilings with small amounts of epibiota at one site, at each of two times. Experimental removals of epibiota from pilings were done to test the hypothesis that epibiota are an important <b>resource</b> <b>to</b> <b>T.</b> taeniatus. Despite great temporal fluctuations in abundances over the duration of the experiment, the response of T. taeniatus to the removal of epibiota from pilings was as predicted, falling to zero following removal of epibiota. Although this suggests that epibiota are an important resource for this species, this pattern was spatially and temporally variable. We suggest that variation in the amount of epibiota has minor effects on the abundances of fishes around pilings. Coleman M. A. and Connell S. D...|$|R
40|$|The {{information}} processing {{capacity of the}} human mind is limited, as is evidenced by the so-called "attentional-blink" deficit: When two targets (T 1 and T 2) embedded in a rapid stream of events are presented in close temporal proximity, the second target is often not seen. This deficit is believed to result from competition between the two targets for limited attentional resources. Here we show, using performance in an attentional-blink task and scalp-recorded brain potentials, that meditation, or mental training, affects the distribution of limited brain resources. Three months of intensive mental training resulted in a smaller attentional blink and reduced brain-resource allocation to the first target, as reflected by a smaller T 1 -elicited P 3 b, a brain-potential index of resource allocation. Furthermore, those individuals that showed the largest decrease in brain-resource allocation to T 1 generally showed the greatest reduction in attentional-blink size. These observations provide novel support for the view that the ability to accurately identify T 2 depends upon the efficient deployment of <b>resources</b> <b>to</b> <b>T</b> 1. The results also demonstrate that mental training can result in increased control over the distribution of limited brain resources. Our study supports the idea that plasticity in brain and mental function exists throughout life and illustrates the usefulness of systematic mental training in the study {{of the human mind}}...|$|R

40|$|The Gila National Forest {{in southwestern}} New Mexico harbors two imperiled aquatic species in its mid-to-high {{elevation}} streams, the Gila chub and the Gila trout. Modern and historical land use pressures, {{and the introduction}} of non-native fishes, have reduced the range of the Gila trout to a handful of headwater streams. The remaining populations are highly fragmented. The Gila National Forest was an early pioneer in the use of naturally ignited wildfire <b>to</b> achieve <b>resource</b> benefi <b>ts.</b> Fish populations can be harmed by fire in some cases, however, even when they have evolved with fire. This occurs when populations dwindle and fi sh habitat connectivity changes through introduction of non-native fish and human impacts downstream, which sometimes make it difficult for fish to migrate to a more favorable location. A retrospective study using satellite sensor and weather information has documented the effects of forest composition, elevation and slope, snow pack, and seasonal and annual variability in precipitation on burn severity in the Gila. Information on past burn severity may help resource managers plan for actions before and during fire seasons to ensure the long-term survival of the Gila trout and Gila chub. In addition, predicting the likelihood and location of severe fire and potential debris and ash flows can help managers decide which streams are best suited to support fish populations for the long term. The ultimate aim is to bolster populations of native trout and promote connectivity of habitat where the fish stand a good chance of thriving. The fate of the endangered chub is even more precarious...|$|R

(b) Design and construction of an Area <b>Resource</b> <b>Test</b> Facility (ARTF) in which developmental geothermal utilization concepts can be tested and evaluated. Program efforts will be divided into four sub-programs; Power Generation, Mineral Extraction, Reservoir Production, and the Area <b>Resources</b> <b>Test</b> Facility. The Power Generation Subprogram will include testing of scale and corrosion control methods, and critical power cycle components; power cycle selection based on an optimization of technical, environmental and economic analyses of candidate cycles; preliminary design of a pilot geothermal-electric generating station to be constructed in Phase 2 of this program. The Mineral Extraction Subprogram will involve the following: selection of an optimum mineral recovery process; recommendation of a brine clean-up process for well injection enhancement; engineering, construction and operation of mineral recovery and brine clean-up facilities; analysis of facility operating results from environmental, economical and technical point-of-view; preliminary design of mineral recovery and brine clean-up facilities of sufficient size to match the planned pilot power plant. The Reservoir Production Subprogram will include monitoring the operation and maintenance of brine production, handling and injection systems which were built with private funding in phase 0, and monitoring of the brine characteristics and potential subsidence effects during well production and injection. Based on the above, recommendations and specifications will be prepared for production and injection systems necessary to serve the pilot power and mineral recovery plants planned for Phase 3.

To study whole-body T lymphocyte dynamics noninvasively in vivo, we generated anti-CD 4 and -CD 8 cys-diabodies (cDbs) {{derived from the}} parental antibody hybridomas GK 1. 5 and 2. 43, respectively, for (89) Zr-immuno-PET detection of helper and cytotoxic T cell populations. METHODS: Anti-CD 4 and -CD 8 cDbs were engineered, produced via mammalian expression, purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography, and characterized for T cell binding. The cDbs were site-specifically conjugated to maleimide-desferrioxamine for (89) Zr radiolabeling and subsequent small-animal PET/CT acquisition and ex vivo biodistribution in both wild-type mice and a model of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation. RESULTS: Immuno-PET and biodistribution studies demonstrate targeting and visualization of CD 4 and CD 8 T cell populations in vivo in the spleen and lymph nodes of wild-type mice, with specificity confirmed through in vivo blocking and depletion studies. Subsequently, a murine model of HSC transplantation demonstrated successful in vivo detection of T cell repopulation at 2, 4, and 8 wk after HSC transplantation using the (89) Zr-radiolabeled anti-CD 4 and -CD 8 cDbs.
