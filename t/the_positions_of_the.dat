The female S.convallis was {{originally}} distinguished from the female S. grandis by the yellow marks from the first to third gastral tergites on S.convallis and yellow marks on all tergites for S.grandis. However, this {{was found to be}} insufficient for correct identification because <b>the</b> <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> markings can vary among different wasps of the same species.|$|E

40|$|Precise object {{manipulation}} by a robot requires precise knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robot endeffector {{relative to}} the object. By the so-called eye-to-hand coordination, both <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> object and <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robot {{relative to the}} camera are determined. In practice, usually <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robot base to camera is calibrated in advanced and <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robot endeffector relative to the base is calculated by forward kinematics with joint angle confgurations. For the robots working in the human environment, they are constructed with lightweight {{in order to increase}} security, which achieves lower stiffness than industrial robots.

5|$|According to Robert van Voren, {{although}} for several years, {{especially after the}} implosion of the USSR and during {{the first years of}} Boris Yeltsin's rule, <b>the</b> <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet psychiatric leaders were in jeopardy, now one can firmly conclude that they succeeded in riding out the storm and retaining their powerful positions. They also succeeded in avoiding an inflow of modern concepts of delivering mental health care and a fundamental change in the structure of psychiatric services in Russia. On the whole, in Russia, the impact of mental health reformers has been the least. Even the reform efforts made in such places as St. Petersburg, Tomsk, and Kaliningrad have faltered or were encapsulated as centrist policies under Putin brought them back under control.|$|E
5|$|After {{making a}} recovery, Kizirian and the Marine units took {{the capital city}} of NaHa and were {{preparing}} for another assault.

When replacements joined the company, many Japanese soldiers harassed the lines by infiltrating <b>the</b> <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more inexperienced soldiers. Kizirian ordered that flares should be fired at irregular intervals to would illuminate the scene and distract the enemy. The idea proved successful and the newly arrived Marines soon had the situation under control.|$|E
30|$|Past {{studies have}} used 2 D {{radiographic}} photos {{to analyze the}} condylar position; however, difficulties arose due to overlapping images <b>of</b> both condyles and <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image changing with <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patient. However, since <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> CT, condyles could be observed without overlap, and <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patient had become irrelevant. As a result, analytical errors have reduced over time and more accurate analyses have become possible.|$|R
40|$|In {{the short}} first section, the author {{points out that}} the {{investigation}} is crucial for the trial and because <b>of</b> this <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accused in investigation is of utmost importance. This also justifies <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accused's <b>position</b> in four historical models <b>of</b> criminal proceedings. <b>The</b> second section is concerned with <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accused in investigation <b>of</b> Roman law. <b>The</b> third section discusses <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accused in early feudal criminal proceedings when neither official nor private investigation in the contemporary form existed. The fourth section is devoted to <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accused in the inquisitorial procedure. The fifth section deals with <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accused in <b>the</b> investigation <b>of</b> a mixed type process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early nineteenth century. In the brief conclusion the author highlights that there is no straight line evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accused's <b>position</b> in investigation. <b>The</b> historical models rather show its raises and falls. <b>The</b> current <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accused in investigation is certainly far more favourable {{than it was in the}} examined historical models of criminal proceedings...|$|R

The battalion reached Auckland on 13 August and proceeded to Pukekohe where a camp had been established. After a few days, the battalion personnel went on leave for two weeks.|$|E

Northwest of Yongdong, 1st Battalion executed an orderly withdrawal, covered by the fire of the Heavy Mortar Company and the two batteries of the 77th Field Artillery Battalion. The mortar operators fought as infantry in the withdrawal. During these retreats North Korean troops disguised themselves as refugees and would form roadblocks in the UN troops' rear areas, or used hidden communications equipment to inform higher commands of UN concentrations so those concentrations could be attacked when they were most vulnerable.|$|E

5|$|Crucially, {{both the}} Wartburg rally in 1817 and the Hambach Festival in 1832 had lacked any {{clear-cut}} program of unification. At Hambach, <b>the</b> <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many speakers illustrated their disparate agendas. Held together {{only by the}} idea of unification, their notions of how to achieve this did not include specific plans but instead rested on the nebulous idea that the Volk (the people), if properly educated, would bring about unification on their own. Grand speeches, flags, exuberant students, and picnic lunches did not translate into a new political, bureaucratic, or administrative apparatus. While many spoke about the need for a constitution, no such document appeared from the discussions. In 1848, nationalists sought to remedy that problem.|$|E
5|$|Each night <b>the</b> <b>{{position}}s</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stars {{appear to}} change as the Earth rotates. However, when a star is located along the Earth's axis of rotation, it {{will remain in the}} same position and thus is called a pole star. The direction of the Earth's axis of rotation gradually changes over time in a process known as the precession of the equinoxes. A complete precession cycle requires 25,770years, during which time the pole of the Earth's rotation follows a circular path across the celestial sphere that passes near several prominent stars. At present the pole star is Polaris, but around 12,000 BC the pole was pointed only five degrees away from Vega. Through precession, the pole will again pass near Vega around AD 14,000. It is the brightest of the successive northern pole stars.|$|E
5|$|Earth has {{undergone}} periodic climate {{shifts in the}} past, including four major ice ages. These consisting of glacial periods where conditions are colder than normal, separated by interglacial periods. The accumulation of snow and ice during a glacial period increases the surface albedo, reflecting more of the Sun's energy into space and maintaining a lower atmospheric temperature. Increases in greenhouse gases, such as by volcanic activity, can increase the global temperature and produce an interglacial period. Suggested causes of ice age periods include <b>the</b> <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> continents, variations in the Earth's orbit, changes in the solar output, and volcanism.|$|E
