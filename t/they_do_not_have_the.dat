5|$|Other {{terrestrial}} arthropods, such as centipedes, millipedes, scorpions, and spiders, {{are sometimes}} confused with insects since their body plans can appear similar, sharing (as do all arthropods) a jointed exoskeleton. However, upon closer examination, their features differ significantly; most noticeably, <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> six-legged characteristic of adult insects.|$|E
5|$|Tyrant flycatchers are Passerine birds which occur {{throughout}} North and South America.

Most are rather plain. As the name implies, most are insectivorous.|$|E

5|$|River {{dolphins}} have conical teeth, used {{to catch}} swift prey such as small river fish. They also have very long snouts, with some measuring , four {{times longer than}} most of their oceanic counterparts. They have a two-chambered stomach that is similar in structure to that of terrestrial carnivores. They have fundic and pyloric chambers. Breathing involves expelling stale air from their blowhole, followed by inhaling fresh air into their lungs. <b>They</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> iconic spout, as this only forms when the warm air exhaled from the lungs meets cold external air, which does not occur in their tropical habitats.|$|E
5|$|Young {{birds have}} a yellowish-red gape. The feather follicles {{appear on the}} fourth day and pin {{feathers}} emerge after a week. Nestlings increase in weight steadily until they are 12 days old. The eyes open on the eighth day, the iris reddish-black while the gape turns red. The young leave the nest after about 16 to 20 days after hatching. <b>They</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> fork in the tail until three weeks. The parents continue to feed and protect them for a month. Young birds may beg for food for longer, but are often ignored or chased away by the adults. Birds reach breeding condition in about two years.|$|E

5|$|Earwigs {{are among}} the few non-social insect species that show {{maternal}} care. The mother will {{pay close attention to}} the needs of her eggs, such as warmth and protection, though {{studies have shown that the}} mother does not pay attention to the eggs as she collects them. The mother has been shown to pick up wax balls by accident, but they would eventually be rejected as <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> proper scent. The mother will also faithfully defend the eggs from predators, not leaving them to eat unless the clutch goes bad. Another distinct maternal care unique to earwigs is that the mother continuously cleans the eggs to protect them from fungi. Studies have found that the urge to clean the eggs persists for days after they are removed; when the eggs were replaced after hatching, the mother continued to clean them for up to 3 months.|$|E
5|$|In the Halo universe, {{humans had}} {{advanced}} to a comparable level {{of technology to}} the Forerunners but, after losing a war with them, all human technology was destroyed and their intelligence reduced, leaving them in a subsistence economy with measures to prevent redevelopment of electronics. Humans {{are aware of the}} other, space-faring races, but their interactions are limited to visits from Forerunners as <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> technology to make contact themselves, they live in wooden buildings and have only primitive steam engines. The San'Shyuum (or Prophets as they are referred to in the Halo games) were also defeated by the Forerunners but their technology was not destroyed; they were instead confined to their home solar system and forbidden to manufacture weapons.|$|E
5|$|Municipalities {{have the}} right to decentralize {{themselves}} and form submunicipalities as an additional level of government. This right and the submunicipalities will cease to exist in the near future {{to reduce the number of}} levels of government. Only Amsterdam, where the districts are called stadsdelen, and Rotterdam, where the districts are called deelgemeenten, consist of such formal subdivisions. The Hague, Almere, Breda, Eindhoven, Enschede, Groningen, Nijmegen and Utrecht have instituted stadsdelen as well, although <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same legal submunicipal status. For administrative use by municipalities and data collection by Statistics Netherlands all municipalities are subdivided into districts (wijken), which in turn are subdivided into neighbourhoods (buurten). These subdivisions have, in contrast to the submunicipalities, no formal status. , the municipalities in the Netherlands were subdivided into 2,621 districts and 11,896 neighbourhoods.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle is}} {{followed}} by the Welshmen destroying the pagan temples while the Aztecs gather to appoint a new king. Games and events are established and follow after the battle. During the various events, a temple becomes covered in flames and idols to the pagan gods appear once again. This {{is followed by}} the Aztecs telling the Welsh to leave before attacking them. A battle takes place in the water surrounding the Aztec city on boats, and the superior Welsh ships are able to win. The Aztecs, unwilling to stop, turn to superstitious rituals and priests travel to a sacred mountain to make sacrifices. However, a sudden lava eruption kills the priests. This causes the Aztecs to believe that <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> support of their gods and they cease their fighting. Admitting defeat, the Aztecs leave the area and head south for Mexico.|$|E
