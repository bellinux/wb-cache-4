50|$|Whilst the Clever {{vehicle was}} {{intended}} to use a low emission engine burning compresses natural gas, the research prototype at the University of Bath uses a 13 kW 176cc single cylinder engine taken from BMW C1 scooter. The original CVT gearbox is retained (albeit modified to provide a power take off to drive the pump for the tilt hydraulics); belt drives are used to transmit power to the two rear wheels. Rear suspension is by way of independent trailing arms, adjustable Öhlins spring/damper units and an anti-roll bar. The front wheel is suspended by a leading four bar linkage with a single Öhlins spring/damper unit and uses a hub-centric steering system. A single <b>track-rod</b> transmits steer inputs to the front wheel from the output arm of a worm-gear steering box, the driver’s steer inputs are transmitted to the steering box via a modified wheel and column sourced from a BMW car.|$|E
50|$|The W152's {{mechanicals}} {{are from}} a Jaguar XJ from 1968-1986. There are three different engine options in a W152, the Jaguar XK6, AJ6 or V12. Any appropriate gearbox can be used but normally a suitable manual gearbox from a Jaguar is used. The W152 uses the independent rear suspension (IRS) unit and front wishbones from the Jaguar donor car but instead of using the standard springs and shock absorbers, it utilises modern coil over shocks. The steering rack is sourced from an MGB and uses extenders to the <b>track-rod</b> ends to suit the wider track of the car. The car uses the standard Jaguar brake calipers and discs but uses a different, split system pedal box, remote fluid reservoirs and twin servos. Most cars up until about 2011 used a custom built pedal box but they now use an OBP pedal box. The front suspension arms and steering arm and track rod end extensions are usually nickel-plated.|$|E
40|$|The work {{addresses}} the optimization {{of the steering}} and roll systems of an innovative four-wheeled tilting vehicle, which is currently being built at the University of Padova. The vehicle {{is a combination of}} traditional two and four-wheeled forms, with the driver operating a bike handlebar to steer, and throttle and brake inputs to control speed. Two pedals control the roll movement, while the gearshifts are made automatically. The steering system consists of a handlebar, column, pinion, rack and <b>track-rods</b> to the wheels. In the resulting spatial mechanism, roll and steer motions of the wheels are coupled. The kinematic optimization presented in this paper, aims at minimizing undesired roll to steer behaviour, and provides appropriate outer/inner wheel steer angles. The natural coordinate approach is employed to efficiently simulate and optimize the mechanism...|$|R
