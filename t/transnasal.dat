50|$|Humidified {{high flow}} nasal airway {{respiratory}} support {{is a method}} of delivering a high per-minute volume of respiratory gas via nasal cannula. The respiratory gas is heated to near body temperature and humidified, usually to saturation vapor pressure. This form of respiratory support is generally referred to as high flow therapy (HFT). HFT is {{also referred to as}} <b>transnasal</b> insufflation (TNI), especially when used for treatment of sleep apnea.|$|E
50|$|<b>Transnasal</b> {{evaporative}} cooling {{is a method}} of inducing the hypothermia process and provides a means of continuous cooling of a person throughout {{the early stages of}} targeted temperature management and during movement throughout the hospital environment. This technique uses two cannulae, inserted into a persons nasal cavity, to deliver a spray of coolant mist that evaporates directly underneath the brain and base of the skull. As blood passes through the cooling area, it reduces the temperature {{throughout the rest of the}} body.|$|E
50|$|The <b>transnasal</b> {{approach}} is used when the surgeon needs {{to access the}} roof of the nasal cavity, the clivus, or the odontoid. This {{approach is}} used to remove chordomas, chondrosarcoma, inflammatory lesions of the clivus, or metastasis in the cervical spine region. The anterior septum or posterior septum is removed so that the surgeon can use both sides of the nose. One side can be used for a microscope and the other side for a surgical instrument, or both sides can be used for surgical instruments.|$|E
50|$|In {{assessment}} of distal esophageal pH, the sensor is placed 5 cm above upper {{border of the}} lower esophageal sphincter (LES) determined by esophageal manometry. To measure proximal esophageal acid exposure the second sensor is placed 1-5 below the lower border of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES). The Bravo pH capsule is placed either transnasally based on manometric measurements, or following endoscopy. In <b>transnasal</b> placement the capsule is placed 5 cm above upper border of the LES, and in endoscopic placement 6 cm above gastroesophageal junction. The same applies to OMOM pH monitoring capsule.|$|E
50|$|<b>Transnasal</b> {{esophagoscopy}} is {{an office}} based procedure {{in which the}} patient is anesthetized locally in the nose and sometimes the oropharynx. The scope is advanced into the ipsilateral pyriform sinus and through the esophageal inlet to the stomach, where the esophagus can be examined, with special attention paid to the gastroesophageal (GE) junction. An advantage of TNE over other more invasive cancer screening methods that require conscious sedation {{is that it can}} be performed using topical anesthesia alone with the patient sitting upright in an exam chair unencumbered by cardiac monitoring equipment.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{surgical}} treatments proposed has included olfactory bulb ablation through a bifrontal craniotomy approach. But a counter-argument by Leopold, Loehrl and Schwob (2002) {{has stated that}} this ablation process results in a bilateral permanent anosmia and includes risks associated with a craniotomy. According to them, the use of <b>transnasal</b> endoscopic exhibition of olfactory epithelium is a safe and effective treatment for patients with unremitting Phantosmia with the olfactory function being potentially spared.It is also cautioned that the surgery is challenging one and is associated with major risks, and {{that it should be}} restricted to expertise centres.|$|E
50|$|Most recently, hypothermic brain {{protection}} {{has been}} associated with rapid brain cooling. In this regard, a new therapeutic approach is the use of intranasal perfluorochemical spray for preferential brain cooling. The nasopharyngeal (NP) approach is unique for brain cooling due to anatomic proximity to the cerebral circulation and arteries. Based on preclinical studies in adult sheep, it was shown that independent of region, brain cooling was faster during NP-perfluorochemical versus conventional whole body cooling with cooling blankets. To date, there have been four human studies including a completed randomized intra-arrest study (200 patients). Results clearly demonstrated that prehospital intra-arrest <b>transnasal</b> cooling is safe, feasible and is associated with an improvement in cooling time.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis of spasmodic {{dysphonia}} {{is often}} delayed {{due to lack}} of recognition of its symptoms by screening physicians. Most people who are correctly diagnosed are evaluated by a team that usually includes an otolaryngologist, a speech-language pathologist and a neurologist. The otolaryngologist examines the vocal folds using a ridged or flexible (<b>transnasal)</b> laryngoscopy to look for other possible causes for the voice disorder. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy, a method whereby a small lighted flexible tube is passed through the nose and into the throat, is a helpful tool that allows the evaluation of the vocal cords movement during speech. Additional diagnostic testing may include stroboscopy, which allows the viewing of the vibrations of the vocal cords in slow motion. The speech-language pathologist evaluates the patient's voice and voice quality. The neurologist evaluates the person for signs of other movement disorders.|$|E
50|$|Even though dysosmia {{often goes}} away {{on its own}} over time, there are both medical and {{surgical}} treatments for dysosmia for patients that want immediate relief. Medical treatments {{include the use of}} topical nasal drops and oxymetazoline HCL, which give an upper nasal block so that the air flow can't reach the olfactory cleft. Other medications suggested include sedatives, anti-depressants, and anti-epileptic drugs. The medications may or may not work and for some patients, the side effects may not be tolerable. Most patients benefit from medical treatment but for some surgical treatment is required. Options include a bifrontal craniotomy and an excision of the olfactory epithelium, which cuts all of the fila olfactoria. According to some studies, <b>transnasal</b> endoscopic excision of the olfactory epithelium {{has been described as a}} safe and effective phantosmia treatment. The bifrontal craniotomy results in permanent anosmia and both surgeries are accompanied with the risks associated with general surgery.|$|E
50|$|Jonathan E. Aviv (Jon- ah- than Ah-veev; born August 24, 1960) is an American otolaryngologist-head {{and neck}} surgeon and a {{professor}} {{of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery}} at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, New York. He is also Clinical Director of the Voice and Swallowing Center at ENT and Allergy Associates in New York City, New York.An inventor, author, educator, physician and surgeon, he is best known for his invention of Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing with Sensory Testing (FEESST), a medical device that allows office-based assessment of oropharyngeal dysphagia, or swallowing disorders, without the use of X-ray. He is also known for his development of <b>Transnasal</b> Esophagoscopy (TNE), a method of examining the esophagus without using conscious or intravenous sedation. From 1991 to 2009, he was a full-time academic surgeon and director of the division of head and neck surgery at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.|$|E
50|$|Guttural pouch tympany is an {{uncommon}} ailment in which excessive amounts of air become {{trapped in the}} pouch, resulting in abnormal expansion. Tympany is usually unilateral, {{but in some cases}} can affect both pouches. It is seen most often in young foals and is more common in females than in males. Tympany results in non-painful, soft swelling beneath the ear and behind the jaw. Additional symptoms may include roaring, difficulty breathing, and difficulty swallowing and/or aspiration pneumonia. Diagnosis is achieved through radiography and endoscopic evaluation. The specific cause of guttural pouch tympany is not known, but it is suspected that it is more common when there are defects of the plica salpingopharyngeus, and/or the pharyngeal orifice where they act as a one-way valve that does not allow air to escape. Because of the risk of secondary infection, it is crucial that tympany be treated as soon as possible. Treatment protocols may include, but are not limited to, surgical intervention and in cases where surgery is not an option, insertion of a <b>transnasal</b> Foley balloon catheter in an attempt to remodel the pharyngeal orifice.|$|E
50|$|This {{approach}} {{is the most common}} and useful technique of endoscopic endonasal surgery and was first described in 1910 concurrently by Harvey Cushing and Oskar Hirsch. This procedure allows the surgeon to access the sellar space, or sella turcica. The sella is a cradle where the pituitary gland sits. Under normal circumstances, a surgeon would use this approach on a patient with a pituitary adenoma. The surgeon starts with the <b>transnasal</b> approach prior to using the transsphenoidal approach. This allows access to the sphenoid ostium and sphenoid sinus. The sphenoid ostium is located on the anterosuperior surface of the sphenoid sinus. The anterior wall of the sphenoid sinus and the sphenoid rostrum is then removed to allow the surgeon a panoramic view of the surgical area. This procedure also requires the removal of the posterior septum to allow the use of both nostrils for tools during surgery. There are several triangles of blood vessels traversing this region, which are just very delicate areas of blood vessels that can be deadly if injured. A surgeon uses stereotactic imaging and a micro Doppler to visualize the surgical field.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Transnasal</b> {{esophagoscopy}} (TNE) is a {{safe and}} inexpensive way to examine the esophagus in patients at risk for esophageal cancer and other disorders. TNE doesn’t require sedation, unlike other techniques widely used {{to look into the}} esophagus. This is possible because TNE uses a camera that is passed through the nose, whereas other techniques, such as upper endoscopy, are performed through the mouth, requiring a patient to be sedated. TNE, as it is used today, was developed by Jonathan E. Aviv who published his findings on the first series of TNE that he performed. [...] The origins of the idea to pass the camera through the nose date from 1993 as first described by C. A. Prescott, MD, a pediatrician otolaryngologist in Cape Town, South Africa [...] and further embellished by Reza Shaker, MD, a gastroenterologist in Milwaukee, WI in 1994. However, it wasn't until the year 2000 when Jonathan E. Aviv, MD, published his findings on the first series of TNE he performed, that it began to have a widespread attention by ear, nose, and throat doctors. Since that time it has been used by both otolaryngologists and gastroenterologists as a diagnostic tool to detect globus, dysphagia, laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), gastroesophageal reﬂux disease (GERD). TNE may also be useful in detecting Barrett's, but there is incongruence between TNE findings and biopsy results. Experts in the field suggest that TNE may replace radiographic imaging of the esophagus in otolaryngology patients with reflux, globus, and dysphagia.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Unsedated <b>transnasal</b> oesogastroduodenoscopy {{significantly}} improves patient tolerance {{compared to}} unsedated conventional peroral oesogastroduodenoscopy. AIMS: To assess {{the adoption of}} <b>transnasal</b> oesogastroduodenoscopy among endoscopists from various European countries and its determinants. METHODS: A survey was distributed to 624 endoscopists attending a live course on digestive endoscopy; a poll was also performed immediately before and after live video retransmission of a <b>transnasal</b> oesogastroduodenoscopy. RESULTS: Answer rate was 48 %; <b>transnasal</b> oesogastroduodenoscopy was practised by 31 % of respondents. In multivariate analysis, practice of <b>transnasal</b> oesogastroduodenoscopy was associated with location in France and Netherlands (P< 0. 0001), availability of many gastroscopes (P< 0. 0001) and less frequent use of sedation (P= 0. 006). Endoscopists who did not practise <b>transnasal</b> oesogastroduodenoscopy cited doubts about its advantages over conventional oesogastroduodenoscopy and lack of training (34 % each) as barriers to adoption. Seventy-four percent of endoscopists practicing <b>transnasal</b> oesogastroduodenoscopy did actually use it in < 20 % of eligible cases. Live video retransmission of a <b>transnasal</b> oesogastroduodenoscopy increased the proportion of endoscopists interested in this technique (P= 0. 006).

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} choice of insertion route and ultrathin endoscope types. METHODS: This prospective study (January-June 2012) included 882 consecutive patients who underwent annual health checkups. <b>Transnasal</b> esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed in 503 patients and transoral EGD in 235 patients using six types of ultrathin endoscopes. Patients were given a choice of insertion route, either transoral or <b>transnasal,</b> prior to EGD examination. For transoral insertion, the endoscope was equipped with a thin-type mouthpiece and tongue depressor. Conscious sedation was not used for any patient. EGD-associated discomfort was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS; no discomfort 0 - maximum discomfort 10). RESULTS: Rates of preference for <b>transnasal</b> insertion were significantly higher in male (male/female 299 / 204 vs 118 / 117) and younger patients (56. 8 1; 11. 2 years vs 61. 3 1; 13. 0 years), although no {{significant difference was found}} in VAS scores between transoral and <b>transnasal</b> insertion (3. 9 1; 2. 3 vs 4. 1 1; 2. 5). Multivariate analysis revealed that gender, age, operator, and endoscope were independent significant predictors of VAS for <b>transnasal</b> insertion, although gender, age, and endoscope were those for transoral insertion. Further analysis revealed only the endoscopic flexibility index (EFI) as an independent significant predictor of VAS for <b>transnasal</b> insertion.

40|$|Background:The {{management}} of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea {{has evolved over}} the last two decades. We present here a review of our 11 -year data on CSF rhinorrhea and its management at a tertiary care hospital in a developing country, with particular reference to the diagnosis, surgical management and outcome of the disease. Methods: The medical charts of all Patients with a diagnosis of CSF rhinorrhea over an 11 -year period were reviewed. The etiology of CSF rhinorrhea was classified into three categories: spontaneous, iatrogenic and traumatic. All the Patients were divided into three categories based on the type of management as conservative, intracranial and <b>transnasal</b> endoscopic groups. Results: A total of 43 Patients fulfilled our inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Eleven of the 43 Patients were managed conservatively, while 22 underwent intracranial repairs, 10 Patients had <b>transnasal</b> endoscopic repairs. The primary success rate for the <b>transnasal</b> approach was 70 % compared to 86 % for the intracranial repair. Blood loss, special care unit (SCU) stay and total cost were found to be significantly less in the <b>transnasal</b> endoscopic group. Computed tomography (CT) cisternography was found to have the highest sensitivity and specificity. Further, no postoperative complications were found in the <b>transnasal</b> endoscopic group, while five Patients from the intracranial group developed various complications.

40|$|Background: There {{is little}} {{evidence}} on the efficacy of glucocorticoid <b>transnasal</b> nebulization therapy in patients with eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Objective: We sought to evaluate the immunologic and remodeling effects of budesonide <b>transnasal</b> nebulization in patients with eosinophilic CRSwNP. Methods: Sixty patients with eosinophilic CRSwNP were randomized to receive budesonide or placebo treatment for 14 days by means of <b>transnasal</b> nebulization in a double-blind manner. Endoscopic polyp size scores (maximum 5 6 points, Kennedy score) and visual analog scale scores for nasal symptoms were assessed before and after treatment. Similarly, polyp samples were evaluated for inflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) by using an immunoassay; collagen by using histochemistry; eosinophils by using hematoxylin and eosin stain; and T-cell subsets by using flow cytometry. Results: Budesonide <b>transnasal</b> nebulization significantly reduced polyp size compared with placebo (mean difference between groups, 20. 73 units; 95 % CI, - 1. 15 to - 0. 32 units; P =. 002) and improved symptoms. Polyp IL- 5 and eotaxin expression decreased significantly, whereas TGF-beta and IL- 10 expression increased. Expression of IFN-gamma and IL- 17 was not altered.
