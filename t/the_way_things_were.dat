5|$|The Regional Congress of the Syrian Regional Branch, in March 1965, devolved {{power from}} the center, the National Command, to the Regional Command. From then on, the Regional Secretary of the Regional Command was {{considered}} Syria's ex officios head of state. The Regional Secretary {{had the power to}} appoint the Prime Minister, the cabinet, the chief of staff and top military commanders. Aflaq was unsettled by <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> moving, and in May he convened the Eighth National Congress to get a showdown between his followers and those of the Military Committee. However, this never came to fruition. Several civilian members of the National Command, such as the Lebanese Jibran Majdalani and the Saudi Ali Ghannam, advised caution, believing that if he pressed the Military Committee too hard the military would take over the Syrian Regional Branch, and then the Ba'ath Party—as had happened in Iraq following the ousting of the Iraqi Regional Branch.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Tony follows Chastity into a cave in {{the woods}} and stumbles upon a bizarre shaft of light. Once Tony steps into the light, he is possessed with the same {{abilities}} that Max and Chastity have, the ability to vibrate at high frequencies, allowing Tony to move faster than normal vision can detect. At the same time, however, Max collapses and is sent to the hospital where it is found he is suffering from exhaustion, withdrawal, a concussion, muscular tears and skeletal fractures - basically, his abilities are killing him. Mulder eventually deduces that he possesses superhuman speed. Chastity sneaks Max out of the hospital where he returns to the cave (even though she suggested they go somewhere else for help but Max refused). Later, the sheriff finds the flashlight in Max's room and confronts his son about the murders. Max confesses and then attempts to kill his father, but Tony intervenes, taking the sheriff's gun; the sheriff is promptly taken to the hospital. That night, Tony and Chastity head to the cave so that Max won't use up any more of the remaining power. Once there, Chastity has been knocked unconscious by Max, who then confronts Tony, using his abilities to take back the gun before throwing it away. However, Chastity (having come to and using her abilities) takes the gun and shoots Max from behind, then allows herself to be shot by the same bullet; she tells Tony that she can't go back to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> before. Afterwards, Tony is seen in the hospital recuperating while numerous geological experts examined the cave, but were unable to identify anything unusual. The city then fills the cave with concrete, sealing it forever, leaving the question as to what caused the teenager-related ability a mystery.|$|E
25|$|Discussions about Fahrenheit 451 often {{center on}} its story {{foremost}} {{as a warning}} against state-based censorship. Indeed, when Bradbury wrote the novel during the McCarthy era, {{he was concerned about}} censorship in the United States. During a radio interview in 1956, Bradbury said:I wrote this book at a time when I was worried about <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> going in this country four years ago. Too many people were afraid of their shadows; there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, things have changed a lot in four years. Things are going back in a very healthy direction. But at the time I wanted to do some sort of story where I could comment on what would happen to a country if we let ourselves go too far in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and we sort of vanish into a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.|$|E

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1965, after {{returning}} from the tour of England documented in the film Dont Look Back, Dylan was unhappy with the public's expectations of him, {{as well as the}} direction his career was taking, and seriously considered quitting the music business. In a 1966 Playboy interview, he described his dissatisfaction: [...] "Last spring, I guess I was going to quit singing. I was very drained, and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> going, it was a very draggy situation... But 'Like a Rolling Stone' changed it all.

500|$|The exact {{causes and}} motivations for Rome's {{military}} conflicts and expansions during the republic {{are subject to}} wide debate. While they {{can be seen as}} motivated by outright aggression and imperialism, historians typically take a much more nuanced view. They argue that Rome's expansion was driven by short-term defensive and inter-state factors (that is, relations with city-states and kingdoms outside Rome's hegemony), and the new contingencies that these decisions created. In its early history, as Rome successfully defended itself against foreign threats in central and then northern Italy, neighboring city-states sought the protection a Roman alliance would bring. As such, early republican Rome was not an [...] "empire" [...] or [...] "state" [...] in the modern sense, but an alliance of independent city-states (similar to the Greek hegemonies of the same period) with varying degrees of genuine independence (which itself changed over time) engaged in an alliance of mutual self-protection, but led by Rome. With some important exceptions, successful wars in early republican Rome generally led not to annexation or military occupation, but to the restoration of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>things</b> <b>were.</b> But the defeated city would be weakened (sometimes with outright land concessions) and thus less able to resist Romanizing influences, such as Roman settlers seeking land or trade with the growing Roman confederacy. It was also less able to defend itself against its non-Roman enemies, which made attack by these enemies more likely. It was, therefore, more likely to seek an alliance of protection with Rome.|$|E

500|$|The 2003 season {{started with}} a 2916 win over the Chiefs in Hamilton. The win was notable because Highlander Willie Walker kicked eight {{penalties}} which was a competition record. They then defeated the Stormers and Bulls before losing to coach Laurie Mains’ old team the Cats in Johannesburg. Winger Aisea Tuilevu was banned for foul play following the match, and Highlander’s captain Tane Randell publicly criticised the South African judicial process. Their second loss of the season came when they played the Crusaders at Carisbrook. The Crusaders won 1716 to record to first loss for the Highlanders at Carisbrook since the 1999 finalwhich was also lost to the Crusaders. The Highlanders had gone three seasons, 2000, 2001 and 2002, and 16 games unbeaten at Carisbrook. The Highlanders then defeated the Blues 2211 to retain the Gordon Hunter Memorial Trophy, and inflict the only loss of the season on the Blues who {{would go on to}} win the 2003 Championship. Following the Highlander’s 4519 defeat of the Brumbies on 25 April it was revealed that a rift had developed between coach Laurie Mains and some of the senior players in the squad. Anton Oliver was branded the ringleader by Mains, but Carl Hoeft said of the conflict; [...] "Anton got hung out as ringleader, {{but a lot of the}} players had issues with <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> going and I was one of themI’m not going to hide from that". The Highlanders lost to the Waratahs at Carisbrook on 3 May, but were in a position to qualify for the semi-finals if they defeated the Queensland Reds in the last round. The Reds won 2823 and their season was over. The defeat was Mains’ last match as coach; he resigned as was replaced by his assistant Greg Cooper.|$|E

2500|$|Beatles for Sale was the Beatles' fourth album {{release in}} the space of 21 months. Neil Aspinall, the band's road manager, later reflected: [...] "No band today would come off a long US tour at the end of September, go into the studio and start a new album, still writing songs, and then go on a UK tour, finish the album in five weeks, still touring, and have the album out in time for Christmas. But that's what the Beatles did at the end of 1964. A lot of it was down to naiveté, {{thinking}} that this was <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> done. If the record company needs another album, you go and make one." [...] Noting the subdued and melancholy tone of much of the album, producer George Martin recalled: [...] "They were rather war weary during Beatles for Sale.
