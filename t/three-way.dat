5|$|After the discovery, {{the rare}} element had only minor applications; for example, {{by the turn}} of the century, rhodium-containing {{thermocouples}} were used to measure temperatures up to 1800°C. The first major application was electroplating for decorative uses and as corrosion-resistant coating. The introduction of the <b>three-way</b> catalytic converter by Volvo in 1976 increased the demand for rhodium. The previous catalytic converters used platinum or palladium, while the <b>three-way</b> catalytic converter used rhodium to reduce the amount of NOx in the exhaust.|$|E

5|$|In {{swimming}} {{there was}} a <b>three-way</b> tie in the men's 100m freestyle event, and three bronze medals were awarded; a tie for {{second place in the}} women's 100m freestyle event meant that no bronze was awarded.

5|$|The element's major use (approximately 80% {{of world}} rhodium production) is {{as one of}} the {{catalysts}} in the <b>three-way</b> catalytic converters in automobiles. Because rhodium metal is inert against corrosion and most aggressive chemicals, and because of its rarity, rhodium is usually alloyed with platinum or palladium and applied in high-temperature and corrosion-resistive coatings. White gold is often plated with a thin rhodium layer to improve its appearance while sterling silver is often rhodium-plated for tarnish resistance.|$|E
5|$|The player {{may choose}} to begin flight on a runway or taxiway, or in the air. Aircraft are {{controlled}} via keyboard, joystick, head-mounted display or specialized input devices such as pedals. During flight, several third- and first-person camera angles may be selected. For example, the third-person Flyby View places the camera {{in front of the}} plane as it flies past, while the first-person <b>Three-Way</b> View displays more information about the plane's position and speed than other angles. Certain camera angles, including the <b>Three-Way</b> View and 3-D Cockpit view, provide the player with simulated flight instruments such as an altimeter, airspeed indicator, accelerometer, variometer and tachometer. The game is designed to allow players to perform aerobatic maneuvers such as the Immelmann turn, tailslide, Lomcevak and Cuban Eight. Performances may be recorded and played back, with controls that allow the player to pause, rewind and fast forward. At any time, the player may stop a recording and resume flight from that point.|$|E
5|$|Upon Marcello Lippi's return, Buffon was {{confirmed}} {{as the starting}} goalkeeper. He played all three group matches during Italy's disappointing 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup campaign in South Africa, in which they finished third in their group in <b>three-way</b> three-point tie. He earned his 100th cap on 14 November 2009 in a friendly match against the Netherlands. He was {{a key player in}} Italy's World Cup qualifying campaign as they finished top of their group, undefeated.|$|E

It was then announced that David had finished in third place after gaining 19.0% of the <b>three-way</b> vote. Davina McCall then revealed that Sophie had won this series with 74.4% of the final two-way vote, with Siavash finishing in second place.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was once}} again {{expected}} to be Italy's star player in the number 10 role, Totti acquired a measure of infamy at Euro 2004 after he spat at Danish midfielder Christian Poulsen in a goalless draw in Italy's opening group match of the tournament on 14 June 2004. He was subsequently banned until the semi-finals, but never {{made it back to}} action and finished the competition scoreless due to Italy's elimination in the first round on direct encounters, following a <b>three-way</b> five point tie with Sweden and Denmark.|$|E
5|$|As a <b>three-way</b> {{loudspeaker}} system employing six individual drive units, each Isobarik kabinet has two tweeters, two midrange drivers and two woofers. One driver of each frequency range faces forward; a second tweeter and midrange are {{mounted on the}} top surface of the enclosure, and one bass unit is hidden from view. While the bass units are isobaric loaded, the midrange is mounted in a terminated transmission line. Crossover points are set at 375Hz between the woofer and midrange, and 3kHz between the tweeter and midrange. The upward-firing drivers were designed to aid dispersion and improve the off-axis listening experience.|$|E
5|$|At soccer {{practice}} the next day, Brendon—still upset with his mother's decision to date his coach—is uncooperative and chastises McGuirk for dating his mother, {{accusing him of}} desires {{to engage in a}} relationship with all the soccer players' mothers. While being driven home by Erik, Brendon asks Erik to fight McGuirk as revenge, but Erik denies his request and suggests he take his mind off the topic by playing a car game. Eventually, Brendon decides to apologize to McGuirk for his behavior, and the two reconcile. Later, McGuirk and Paula decide over the phone to end their relationship, a decision Brendon overhears using <b>three-way</b> calling.|$|E
5|$|At the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria, the Soviet {{team won}} all seven of its games, earning the gold medal. Canada {{finished}} the tournament with five wins and two losses, putting {{the team in}} a <b>three-way</b> tie for second place with Sweden and Czechoslovakia. Before 1964, the tie-breaking procedure was based on goal difference in games against teams in the medal round; under that system, Canada would have placed third ahead of the Czechoslovakian team. During the tournament the procedure was changed to take all games into consideration, which meant that the Canadians finished fourth. At the time, the Olympics counted as the World Championships; under their (unchanged) rules, Canada should have received bronze for the World Championships.|$|E
5|$|Buffon played {{every minute}} of Italy's 2002 World Cup campaign, keeping a clean sheet in the opening match against Ecuador, and saving a {{controversial}} penalty against co-hosts South Korea in the round of 16, which {{was not enough to}} stop the under-performing side from being eliminated by a golden goal in extra time. He also featured in every match at Euro 2004, keeping a clean sheet in his nation's opening 0–0 draw against Denmark, although Italy, despite not losing a match, once again underperformed, and were eliminated in the first round on direct encounters following a <b>three-way,</b> five-point tie with Sweden and Denmark.|$|E
