500|$|In February 2009, Samuel L. Jackson, who had briefly portrayed Nick Fury {{at the end}} of {{the film}} Iron Man, signed on to reprise the role in Thor as part of an {{unprecedented}} nine-picture deal with Marvel Studios. However, in an April 2010 interview, Jackson stated that he would not be appearing in Thor. When asked why not Jackson explained, [...] "I have no idea. I'm not in charge of making those kinds of decisions. I thought I was; <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> was in the trades, and I was like, 'Ooh! I got a job!' I called my agent he said, 'Naw, you're not in it.' I was like, 'Well shit, they need to pay me if they're gonna put my name in it. Later in the month, Jackson revealed that he would be filming a scene for Thor to serve as [...] "connective tissue" [...] for The Avengers. Also in February, a casting call went out looking for actors with certain physical attributes to audition for the role of Thor.|$|E

[...] He said he had [...] "bitter feelings" [...] toward the newspapers for their unfair treatment of him. He expressed doubts that the BSO, then in a sorry state of organization, could recover from the internment of 29 of its German members. After his deportation from the United States, he declined all offers {{to bring him back}} to the United States after the war.|$|E

2500|$|Despite this, {{during the}} casting period in 1984, Taylforth auditioned {{for the role}} of Sue Osman. She was {{unsuccessful}} and that part went to Sandy Ratcliff, however, Holland and Smith asked her back to audition for another role, the part of Kathy. Smith and Holland have commented that [...] "she came into the room, bringing the whole of the 'East-end' in with her [...] In exactly half a minute she'd charmed the pants off them". She was considered perfect, apart from her age. Smith and Holland have commented in their book Inside Story that [...] " [...] was too young! They had said so from the beginning. By rights, they should not even be interviewing her. But wasn't she perfect, apart from her age? So different from any other 'Kathy' they had seen. Fresher. More down to earth. Ages were discussed and a pocket-calculator produced. If Pete Beale had been her first boyfriend, wasn't it just possible that she could have a fourteen-year-old son? Julia and Tony were trying to talk themselves into it." [...] Taylforth has commented on the audition process, [...] " [...] whipped out a calculator and kept punching in numbers. 'We're trying to work out if you could be old enough to be Ian's Mum,' <b>they</b> <b>said.</b> <b>I</b> said, 'I can look older. I'll put my hair up. I'll have a few late nights and I promise I'll look old enough to be Ian's Mum'." [...] According to Holland and Smith, Gillian Taylforth's [...] "freshness and earthy charm" [...] won them around and she was offered the part of Kathy.|$|E
6000|$|But Pansy, {{responding}} {{again to}} the company rather than her guardian's counsel, and as if appealing to them, went on half poutingly: [...] "Yes! I runned away because they teased me! Because they didn't like you and said horrid things. Because they told awful, dreadful lies! Because <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> wasn't no orphan!--that my name wasn't Stannard, and that you'd made it all up.

6000|$|... 'Oh, <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> did not {{any longer}} {{properly}} attend to my work. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> was careless, and that I made mistakes; they complained that I was unpunctual, that I went late and came away early; and one day, because I 'adn't been there the day before, {{they told me}} to leave.

6000|$|... "No, I {{waited until}} Coulter joined Paxton. The two {{walked out on}} the campus, so I didn't catch what <b>they</b> <b>said.</b> <b>I</b> told them to follow me, and they are now out in the hall." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{leave the}} army, Mr. Jackson," [...] {{answered}} his visitor; [...] "it left me; I was invalided out. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> should never get my health back after that last go of fever, but I did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd as soon walk {{about the}} streets," [...] she said pathetically. [...] "Mother'll never listen to me--or the others. Some of them saw me with Stephen, and <b>they</b> <b>said</b> things. <b>I</b> think I'll {{go to the}} station and wait till the five o'clock train." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{used to play}} hockey as well as {{football}} so {{the teachers}} used {{to try and make}} me play hockey instead. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> that <b>I</b> should choose to play hockey because with football I wouldn't get anywhere... <b>they</b> just <b>said</b> women had nowhere to go in football."

6000|$|... "Am I rescued, too!--I thought <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> was shot, {{and about}} to die. Mother is dead; and so is father; but you are living, Judith, and so is Hurry. I was afraid Hurry would be killed, when I heard him {{shouting}} among the soldiers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They took me away, and {{the surgeon}} {{examined}} me. To cut things short, I was pronounced mad, {{and three days}} later the commissioners passed me for a pauper asylum.
