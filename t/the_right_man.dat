With {{elements}} of the 11th Army, Manstein {{was transferred to the}} Leningrad front, arriving on 27 August 1942. Manstein again lacked the proper forces to storm the city, so he planned Operation Nordlicht, a bold plan for a thrust to cut off Leningrad's supply line at Lake Ladoga.|$|E

While, Dilshan did score 193 runs against England at Lord's, and broke the record for the highest individual score made by a Sri Lankan at the venue, plus leading Sri Lanka to their maiden test win in South Africa. Losses to England, Australia, Pakistan and South Africa put strain on his captaincy which he relinquished in Jan 2012.|$|E

25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, women were regarded as society's guardians of morality; they were seen as possessing a finer nature than men and were expected to act as such. Their role was not defined as workers or money makers. Women were expected to hold on to their innocence until <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>man</b> came along so that they can start a family and inculcate that morality they were in charge of preserving. The role of men was to support the family financially. Yet {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, social attitudes towards educating young women were changing. Women in North America and Western Europe were now becoming more and more educated, in no small part because of the efforts of pioneering women to further their own education, defying opposition by male educators. By 1900, four out of five colleges accepted women and a whole coed concept was becoming more and more accepted.|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} representatives, egged on by Wilson, beginning 13 December 1917, recommended coordinated defence and reserves {{from north}} sea to Adriatic, {{as well as}} reorganisation of the Belgian Army and preparing studies of the Italian and Salonika Fronts. Wilson worked even on Christmas Day. He set up three main sections “Allied” and “Enemy” operations, and “Material and Manpower” – the latter under Frederick Sykes covered both sides and included air power. There was also a “Political” Branch under Leo Amery, although he reported to Hankey back in London. However, Rawlinson was unimpressed by the calibre of Wilson’s staff and the young Archibald Wavell thought the atmosphere overly pessimistic. That month Wilson defended Haig to Clemenceau and Foch, both of whom wanted him removed (Clemenceau preferred Allenby as Haig’s replacement, Foch preferred Plumer), telling Clemenceau that Haig was <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>man</b> for the “bad times” which were coming, although he was critical of Robertson.|$|E
25|$|Jamie Bell's {{audition}} {{for the role}} of Smike in a London hotel room left McGrath and the producers in tears, and they cast him on the spot. While considering Mrs. Crummles, a smug, opinionated, but lovable dowager, McGrath realized all her traits and characteristics were embodied by Dame Edna Everage, alter ego of actor Barry Humphries, but was hesitant to suggest casting a male in the role. The producers, however, agreed Humphries was an ideal choice. Nicholas {{was one of the last}} roles to be cast. Charlie Hunnam had been sent the script, but several months passed before he had an opportunity to read it. He met with McGrath, and based on a couple of hours of conversation with the actor, the director felt he finally had found <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>man</b> for the part. Ironically, the British Hunnam had to work with a dialect coach; having lived and worked in the US for the past several years, he had perfected an American accent in order to ensure regular employment.|$|E

The main linkages are radicalism, the idea of <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> of <b>men</b> and religion. Both Mazzini and Martineau believed in representative democracy and in the theoretical foundation of democracy, that is equality and brotherhood. Martineau, as well as Mazzini, had a less individualist conception of <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> of <b>men</b> than <b>the</b> current intepretation.

It was written by Steve Kipner, Andrew Frampton, Wayne Wilkins and Bedingfield for her second album, N.B. (2007).

[...] Marshall was confirmed as an Associate Justice by a Senate vote of 69–11 on August 31, 1967.

500|$|Cornwallis moved {{forces to}} Camden from Charleston, and on August 16 inflicted an {{embarrassing}} defeat on Gates at the Battle of Camden. [...] The relatively untried Continentals in Gates' army were routed, and suffered heavy casualties. This served to keep South Carolina clear of Continental forces, {{and was a}} blow to rebel morale. The victory added to his reputation, although the rout of the American rebels had {{as much to do}} with the failings of Gates (whose rapid departure from the battlefield was widely noted) as it did the skill of Cornwallis. [...] In London, Cornwallis was perceived as a hero, and was viewed by many there as <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>man</b> to lead the British forces to victory over the rebels.|$|E
500|$|Detzner's {{mission was}} {{also to be}} the first serious attempt to explore the unknown {{interior}} and to evaluate and describe its contents. The boundary between Papua and Kaiser Wilhelmsland had been broadly established by a joint British-German expedition in 1909, but the interior had not been mapped and the German colonial administration maintained that the boundary was imprecise. [...] Since then, Papuan gold prospectors may have crossed into the German territory which, from the German perspective, made the accuracy of the border essential. [...] Detzner had had experience in joint operations in Kamerun in 1907–08 and could be expected to understand the challenges faced by the previous commission; he had a reputation as a methodical and precise engineer. [...] Although small, he was tough and wiry, extremely focused and determined, and seemed like <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>man</b> for the job.|$|E
500|$|Governor Reagan's term {{ended in}} 1975, {{and he did}} not run for a third; instead, he met with advisors to discuss a {{possible}} bid for the presidency in 1976, challenging incumbent President Gerald Ford. Ronald still needed to convince a reluctant Nancy before running, however. She feared for her husband's health and his career as a whole, though she felt that he was <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>man</b> for the job and eventually approved. Nancy took on a more traditional role in the campaign, holding coffees, luncheons, and talks, with senior citizens. With that, she oversaw personnel, monitored her husband's schedule, and occasionally provided press conferences. The 1976 campaign included the so-called [...] "battle of the queens", contrasting Nancy with First Lady Betty Ford. They both spoke out {{over the course of the}} campaign on similar issues, but with different approaches. Nancy was particularly upset by the warmonger image that the Ford campaign had drawn of her husband.|$|E

500|$|Groves {{told them}} {{that he was looking}} for someone with [...] "a sound {{understanding}} of both practical and theoretical ordnance– high explosives, guns and fusing– a wide acquaintance and an excellent reputation among military ordnance people and an ability to gain their support; a reasonably broad background in scientific development; and an ability to attract and hold the respect of scientists." [...] He said that a military officer would be his ideal, as the job might involve planning and coordinating the use of the bomb, but added that he knew of no Army officer who fit the bill. Bush then suggested Parsons, a nomination supported by Purnell. The next morning, Parsons {{received a phone call from}} Purnell, ordering him to report to Admiral King, who was now the Commander in Chief, US Fleet (Cominch). In a terse ten-minute meeting, King briefed Parsons on the Project, which he said had his full backing. That afternoon, Parsons met with Groves, who quickly sized him up as <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>man</b> for the job.|$|E
500|$|Ultimately, the {{producers}} turned to 30-year-old Sean Connery for five films. It is often reported that Connery won the role through a contest {{set up to}} [...] "find James Bond". While this is untrue, the contest itself did exist, and six finalists were chosen and screen tested by Broccoli, Saltzman, and Fleming. The winner of the contest was a 28-year-old model named Peter Anthony, who, according to Broccoli, had a Gregory Peck quality, but proved unable {{to cope with the}} role. When Connery was invited to meet Broccoli and Saltzman he appeared scruffy and in unpressed clothes, but Connery [...] "put on an act and it paid off" [...] as he acted in the meeting with a macho, devil-may-care attitude. When he left both Saltzman and Broccoli watched him through the window as he went to his car, both agreeing that he was <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>man</b> for Bond. After Connery was chosen, Terence Young took the actor to his tailor and hairdresser, and introduced him to the high life, restaurants, casinos and women of London. In the words of Bond writer Raymond Benson, Young educated the actor [...] "in the ways of being dapper, witty, and above all, cool".|$|E
500|$|In 1971 the Philadelphia Flyers {{were looking}} for a new coach, and general manager Keith Allen {{suggested}} Shero to owner Ed Snider.

He knew Shero always had a winning record, plus he had a [...] "gut feeling" [...] he was <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>man</b> for the job. Snider agreed to bring in Shero because he trusted Allen's judgment. Thus Shero became the third coach in Flyers history; he had high hopes for the Season predicting that the Flyers would finish no worse than second in the West Division. The 1971–72 season was disappointing for Shero as the Flyers finished in 5th place in the West with a 26–38–14 record. The Flyers 66 points were actually a decrease of 7 points in the standings and they missed the playoffs {{for the second time in}} three years. Shero's [...] "Fog" [...] nickname was also re-established during the year following a game at the Omni Coliseum in Atlanta when he left the arena through a door with no re-entry and became locked outside prior to the post-game press conference. At the press conference no one knew where Shero was and reporters unsuccessfully searched the arena for him.|$|E
