Postulate to close the material cycle in economy poses for designer teams new, other than heretofore issues. Design for assembly that principles, methodology, and co-ordination {{in the frame of}} concurrent design already exist, does not meet demands of reverse logistics.

The Abstraction Refinement Model enables a coherent characterization of <b>the</b> <b>reverse</b> engineering <b>requirements</b> generally caused by a faulty or inadequately documented development process. Within the context of the model, the Automated Documentation Design System (ADDS) is characterized, and the system is evaluated with regard to its current capabilities versus future potential.

40|$|Biological {{control systems}} {{regulate}} {{the behavior of}} biological systems in a constantly changing environment. Homeostasis is the most widely studied outcome of biological control systems. Homeostatic systems maintain the system in its desired state despite variations in system parameters or the externally-determined input rates of their constituents, i. e. they have zero or near zero steady state error. On the other hand, allostatic systems are not resistant against environmental changes and the steady state level of their controlled variables responds positively to the changes in their input rates. Little is known, however, on the existence and frequency of reverse allostatic systems, where the steady state value of the controlled variable correlates negatively with the input rate of that variable. In the present study, we derive the minimal conditions for the existence and local stability of reverse allostatic systems, and demonstrate in examples of metabolic, pharmacological, pathophysiological and ecological systems that <b>the</b> <b>reverse</b> allostasis <b>requirements</b> are relatively non-stringent and may be satisfied in biological systems more commonly than usually thought. The possible existence of reverse allostatic systems in nature and their counter-intuitive implications in physiological systems, drug treatment, ecosystem management, and biological control are explored and testable predictions are made...|$|R

Ohio 1942), was a patent-antitrust {{case that}} the Government brought against a cartel in the glass {{container}} industry. The cartel, among other things, divided the fields of manufacture of glass containers, first, into blown glass (allocated to Corning Glass Works) and pressed glass, which was subdivided into: products made under the suction process (allocated to Owens-Illinois Glass Co.), milk bottles (allocated to Thatcher Mfg. Co.), and fruit jars (allocated to Ball Bros. plus a fixed production quota for Owens-Illinois, and Hazel-Atlas Co.). The trial court found the cartel violative of the antitrust laws and the Supreme Court agreed that the market division and related conduct were illegal. The trial court required royalty-free licensing of present patents and reasonable royalty licensing of future patents. A divided Supreme Court <b>reversed</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirement</b> for royalty-free licensing as [...] "confiscatory," [...] but sustained the requirement for reasonable royalty licensing of the patents.|$|R

40|$|Photoperiodic {{flowering}} {{has been}} extensively studied in the annual short-day and long-day plants rice and Arabidopsis while less {{is known about the}} control of flowering in perennials. In the perennial wild strawberry, Fragaria vesca L. (Rosaceae), short-day and perpetual flowering long-day accessions occur. Genetic analyses showed that differences in their flowering responses are caused by a single gene, the SEASONAL FLOWERING LOCUS which may encode the F. vesca homolog of TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (FvTFL 1). We show through high-resolution mapping and transgenic approaches that FvTFL 1 is the basis of this change in flowering behavior and demonstrate that FvTFL 1 acts as a photoperiodically regulated repressor. In short-day F. vesca, long photoperiods activate FvTFL 1 mRNA expression and short days suppress it, promoting flower induction. These seasonal cycles in FvTFL 1 mRNA level confer seasonal cycling of vegetative and reproductive development. Mutations in FvTFL 1 prevent LD suppression of flowering, and the early flowering that then occurs under LD is dependent on the F. vesca homolog of FLOWERING LOCUS T. This photoperiodic response mechanism differs from those described in model annual plants. We suggest that this mechanism controls flowering within the perennial growth cycle in F. vesca, and demonstrate that a change in a single gene <b>reverses</b> <b>the</b> photoperiodic <b>requirements</b> for flowering...|$|R
