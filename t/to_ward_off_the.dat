5|$|Some caterpillars, {{especially}} {{members of}} Papilionidae, contain an osmeterium, a Y-shaped protrusible gland {{found in the}} prothoracic segment of the larvae. When threatened, the caterpillar emits unpleasant smells from the organ <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> predators.|$|E

5|$|City at the End of Time is a 2008 {{science fiction}} novel by American writer Greg Bear. It was {{published}} in August 2008 by Del Rey in the United States, and Gollancz in the United Kingdom. The story follows three drifters in present-day Seattle who are tormented by strange dreams of the Kalpa, a city one hundred trillion years in the future. The Kalpa is attempting <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Typhon, an inexplicable entity that has consumed {{the rest of the}} ancient universe and broken down the laws of physics.|$|E

5|$|However, {{vegetables}} often {{also contain}} toxins and antinutrients which {{interfere with the}} absorption of nutrients. These include α-solanine, α-chaconine, enzyme inhibitors (of cholinesterase, protease, amylase, etc.), cyanide and cyanide precursors, oxalic acid, and others. These toxins are natural defenses, used <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> insects, predators and fungi that might attack the plant. Some beans contain phytohaemagglutinin, and cassava roots contain cyanogenic glycoside as do bamboo shoots. These toxins can be deactivated by adequate cooking. Green potatoes contain glycoalkaloids and should be avoided.|$|E
5|$|On 30 November 2011, the ECB, the US Federal Reserve, {{the central}} banks of Canada, Japan, Britain and the Swiss National Bank {{provided}} global financial markets with additional liquidity <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> debt crisis {{and to support}} the real economy. The central banks agreed to {{lower the cost of}} dollar currency swaps by 50 basis points to come into effect on 5 December 2011. They also agreed to provide each other with abundant liquidity to make sure that commercial banks stay liquid in other currencies.|$|E
5|$|Warwick Davis as Nikabrik, a black dwarf. He is {{descendant}} of Ginarrbrik, who served the White Witch, and bears {{one of his}} rings, which was passed down from each generation. Mark Johnson acknowledged casting Davis as the treacherous Nikabrik was casting against type: Berger covered all his face bar his eyelids in prosthetics, to allow Davis <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> audience's perceptions of him. Nikabrik's nose was based on Berger. Davis feared filming in the Czech Republic, because the grass is filled with ticks, so he put elastic bands to hold his trousers against his legs. Davis portrayed Reepicheep in the 1989 BBC production of Prince Caspian.|$|E
50|$|The Dramyin's melodious {{sound is}} {{supposed}} to attract demons, {{and the role of}} the carved chusing on <b>the</b> pegbox acts <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> demons. <b>The</b> Dramyin is associated with a guardian deity in the Dramyin Cham.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{of those}} who had been written about or [...] "Franked," [...] {{threatened}} lawsuits, and many issues toward the end of Michael Bate's ownership contained printed apologies as a means <b>to</b> <b>warding</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> expense of lawyers' fees. The magazine bit the bullet on only two legal battles—one to a Quebec judge and one to Mike Duffy, a Canadian television journalist whom the magazine deemed a [...] "fat-faced liar" [...] and had called [...] "Mike Puffy" [...] (in reference to his physical appearance). Although the magazine settled on the latter case, the legal expenses launched the Ottawa edition into a downward financial spiral.|$|R
50|$|One {{interesting}} gameplay {{feature is}} being able to use different items and instruments <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> enemies. <b>The</b> player starts with the guitar, and if they collect and switch to a different instrument, the game's music changes to reflect the instrument that is being played.|$|R
5|$|Personal {{interaction}} with the gods took many forms. People who wanted information or advice consulted oracles, run by temples, {{that were supposed to}} convey gods' answers to questions. Amulets and other images of protective deities were used <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> demons that might threaten human well-being or to impart the god's positive characteristics to the wearer. Private rituals invoked the gods' power to accomplish personal goals, from healing sickness to cursing enemies. These practices used heka, the same force of magic that the gods used, which the creator was said to have given to humans so they could fend off misfortune. The performer of a private rite often took on the role of a god in a myth, or even threatened a deity, to involve the gods in accomplishing the goal. Such rituals coexisted with private offerings and prayers, and all three were accepted means of obtaining divine help.|$|E
5|$|In late 1757, the Bani Saqr and Sardiyah tribes, who Zahir {{maintained}} ties with, {{launched an}} assault on the Hajj caravan as it was returning to Syria from Mecca. Thousands of Muslim pilgrims were killed in the raid, including Sultan Osman III's sister. The attack shocked the Sublime Porte (Ottoman imperial government), and discredited the governor of Damascus and amir al-hajj, Husayn Pasha ibn Makki, for failing <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Bedouin. Husayn Pasha had been serving his first term as governor, having replaced As'ad Pasha al-Azm, who Zahir had peaceful relations with, and among Husayn Pasha's priorities were subduing Zahir and annexing his territories, which were part of Sidon Eyalet. Husayn Pasha lodged a complaint to the Sublime Porte alleging Zahir's involvement in the raid. Zahir denied the allegation and pressed for an investigation into the assault. He also sought to earn the Sublime Porte's favor by purchasing the looted goods of the caravan from the tribes, including the decorated banners representing Muhammad and the sovereignty of the sultan, and restoring them to Sultan Mustafa III (Osman III had died on 30 October). Moreover, Zahir's enemy Husayn Pasha was dismissed that year.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese {{belief in}} the Mandate of Heaven granted to the ailing Tang was also {{challenged}} when natural calamities occurred, forcing many to believe the Heavens were displeased and that the Tang had lost their right to rule. Then in 873 a disastrous harvest shook {{the foundations of the}} empire; in some areas only half of all agricultural produce was gathered, and tens of thousands faced famine and starvation. In the earlier period of the Tang, the central government was able to meet crises in the harvest, as it was recorded from 714–719 that the Tang government responded effectively to natural disasters by extending the price-regulation granary system throughout the country. The central government was able then to build a large surplus stock of foods <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> rising danger of famine and increased agricultural productivity through land reclamation. In the 9th century, however, the Tang government was nearly helpless in dealing with any calamity.|$|E
50|$|Another theory {{concerning}} the placing of horseshoes above doorways is <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> Faeries; <b>the</b> theory being that supernatural beings are repelled by iron and as horseshoes were an easily available source of iron, {{they could be}} nailed above a door to prevent any unwanted, otherworldly guests.|$|R
5000|$|The stone-floored verandas, {{latticed}} arches, and French {{windows are}} {{several of the}} distinctive foreign elements included in the residence, while Japanese influence {{can be seen in}} the tile roof with its demon-headed tiles intended <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> evil. <b>The</b> roof was modified by adding unmistakably British chimneys.|$|R

5|$|The thin {{long legs}} of the {{hartebeest}} provide for a quick escape in an open habitat; if attacked, the formidable horns are used <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> predator. The elevated position of the eyes enables the hartebeest to inspect its surroundings continuously even as it is grazing. The muzzle has evolved so as to derive maximum nutrition from even a frugal diet. The horns are also used during fights among males for dominance in the breeding season; the clash of the horns is loud enough {{that it can be}} heard from hundreds of metres away. The beginning of a fight is marked with a series of head movements and stances, as well as depositing droppings on dung piles. The opponents drop onto their knees and, after giving a hammer-like blow, begin wrestling, their horns interlocking. One attempts to fling the head of the other to one side to stab the neck and shoulders with his horns. Fights are rarely serious, but can be fatal if they are.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} become so {{numerous}} that they conflict with local people. In the United States, pinnipeds are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA). Since that year, California sea lion populations have risen to 250,000. These animals began exploiting more man-made environments, like docks, for haul-out sites. Many docks are not designed to withstand the weight of several resting sea lions. Wildlife managers have used various methods to control the animals, and some city officials have redesigned docks so they can better withstand use by sea lions. Sea lions also conflict with fisherman since both depend on the same fish stocks. In 2007, MMPA was amended to permit the lethal removal of sea lions from salmon runs at Bonneville Dam. The 2007 law seeks to relieve pressure on the crashing Pacific Northwest salmon populations. Wildlife officials have unsuccessfully attempted <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> sea lions using bombs, rubber bullets and bean bags. Efforts to chase sea lions away from the area have also proven ineffective. Critics like the Humane Society object to {{the killing of the}} sea lions, claiming that hydroelectric dams pose a greater threat to the salmon. Similar conflicts have existed in South Africa with brown fur seals. In the 1980s and 1990s, South African politicians and fisherman demanded that the fur seals be culled, believing that the animals competed with commercial fisheries. Scientific studies found that culling fur seals would actually {{have a negative effect on}} the fishing industry, and the culling option was dropped in 1993.|$|E

50|$|Although nutritious, {{vegetable}} staples {{generally do}} not provide {{a full range of}} nutrients, so other foods need to be added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> diet, <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> malnutrition. <b>The</b> deficiency disease pellagra is associated with a diet consisting primarily of maize; the disease beriberi with a diet of white (refined) rice.|$|R
50|$|Lay Anglicans, Catholics, Lutherans, Methodists, among Christians {{of other}} denominations, are not {{permitted}} to perform exorcisms, but they can use the Saint Benedict Medal, holy water, the crucifix, and other sacramentals <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> evil. <b>The</b> Saint Benedict Medal {{in the middle of a}} Celtic Cross is believed to be a powerful tool against evil influences.|$|R
50|$|Their {{decoration}} {{is mostly}} necklaces, used primarily <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> spirits. <b>The</b> concept of drawing is alien {{to them and}} when asked to draw a person, animal, tree, or river, the result is simple lines.

5000|$|The {{plant has}} also been used ceremonially by the Tlingit and Haida people of Southeast Alaska.

5000|$|Used {{to protect}} against evil eye, a {{malicious}} stare believed {{to be able to}} cause illness, death or just general unluckiness, hamsas often contain an eye symbol. Depictions of the hand, the eye or the number five in Arabic (and Berber) tradition are related <b>to</b> <b>warding</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> evil eye, as exemplified in the saying khamsa fi ainek ("five fingers in your eye"). Raising one's right hand with the palm showing and the fingers slightly apart is part of this curse meant [...] "to blind the aggressor". Another formula uttered against the evil eye in Arabic, but without hand gestures, is khamsa wa-khamis ("five and Thursday"). As the fifth day of the week, Thursday is considered a good day for magic rites and pilgrimages to the tombs of revered saints to counteract the effects of the evil eye.|$|R

25|$|The Ragyndrudis Codex (Codex Bonifatianus II) is {{an early}} medieval codex of {{religious}} texts, now in Fulda in Germany, which is closely associated with Saint Boniface, who, according to tradition, used {{it at the time}} of his martyrdom <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> swords or axes of the Frisians who killed him on 5 June 754 near Dokkum, Friesland. This long association has given the codex the status of a contact relic.|$|E
25|$|A {{persistent}} question regarding D. radiodurans is {{how such}} {{a high degree of}} radioresistance could evolve. Natural background radiation levels are very low—in most places, on the order of 0.4mGy per year, and the highest known background radiation, near Ramsar, Iran is only 260mGy per year. With naturally occurring background radiation levels so low, organisms evolving mechanisms specifically <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> effects of high radiation are unlikely.|$|E
25|$|Paracetamol (acetaminophen) but not aspirin {{may be used}} {{to reduce}} fever.

50|$|Jumping {{the broom}} {{developed}} {{out of the}} West African Asante custom.

25|$|The seals had a {{religious}} element to them. Daoists used seals as healing devices by impressing therapeutic characters onto {{the flesh of}} sick people.
