5|$|Both ships carried one {{aircraft}} catapult {{for a pair}} of Heinkel He 60 biplane reconnaissance float planes. They were {{equipped with}} a crane to retrieve the aircraft after landing. The He 60s were later replaced by the monoplane Arado Ar 196 by 1939. Leipzigs catapult was located between <b>the</b> <b>funnel</b> and the forward superstructure, while Nürnbergs was placed aft of <b>the</b> <b>funnel.</b>|$|E
5|$|The ink sac of an octopus {{is located}} under the {{digestive}} gland. A gland {{attached to the}} sac produces the ink, and the sac stores it. The sac is close enough to <b>the</b> <b>funnel</b> for the octopus to shoot out the ink with a water jet. Before it leaves <b>the</b> <b>funnel,</b> the ink passes through glands which mix it with mucus, creating a thick, dark blob which allows the animal to escape from a predator. The main pigment in the ink is melanin, which gives it its black colour. Cirrate octopuses lack the ink sac.|$|E
5|$|The {{only known}} {{modification}} after the ship's completion was {{the addition of}} a hurricane deck between the turret and <b>the</b> <b>funnel</b> sometime {{after the end of the}} Civil War.|$|E
50|$|To {{serve as}} a beacon at night during {{emergencies}} <b>the</b> three <b>funnels</b> on <b>the</b> Empress of Britain were illuminated with powerful flood lights. From <b>the</b> air <b>the</b> <b>funnels</b> could be spotted 50 miles away and ships could spot <b>the</b> illuminated <b>funnels</b> 30 miles distance.|$|R
50|$|Armament was {{increased}} over the Acastas, {{with the number of}} torpedo tubes doubled to two pairs - abaft <b>the</b> <b>funnels</b> - with a small searchlight platform in between. The gun armament remained as three QF 4-inch, but was more usefully distributed; with one gun each on the forecastle, between <b>the</b> <b>funnels</b> (<b>the</b> after pair in ships with three) and on the quarterdeck.|$|R

5|$|As the mesocyclone lowers {{below the}} cloud base, {{it begins to}} take in cool, moist air from the {{downdraft}} region of the storm. The convergence of warm air in the updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an {{area of low pressure}} at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, {{in the form of a}} visible condensation funnel. As <b>the</b> <b>funnel</b> descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, fanning outward and creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado. Usually, <b>the</b> <b>funnel</b> cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.|$|E
5|$|Saratoga {{received}} a RCA CXAM-1 {{early warning radar}} in February 1941 during a refit in Bremerton. The antenna was mounted on the forward lip of <b>the</b> <b>funnel</b> with its control room directly below the aerial, replacing the secondary conning station formerly mounted there. She also received two FC (Mk 3) surface fire-control radars in late 1941, although these were both removed along with her main armament in January 1942. The new dual-purpose guns were controlled by two Mk 37 directors, each mounting an FD (Mk 4) anti-aircraft gunnery radar. When the 1.1-inch guns were replaced by 40mm guns in 1942, the directors for the smaller guns were replaced by five Mk 51 directors. A small SC-1 early warning radar was mounted on the rear lip of <b>the</b> <b>funnel</b> during 1942. A SG surface-search radar was mounted on the foremast at the same time.|$|E
5|$|While largely out of {{site from}} the bay {{for which it is}} named, Arthur's Baye Mill & Bakery shared a {{building}} with store called The Market Place. The retail is now The Fun Shoppe, with the generically named Medieval Funnel Cakes. There is a Coca-Cola Freestyle location at <b>the</b> <b>funnel</b> cake store.|$|E
50|$|In steam ships <b>the</b> <b>funnels</b> {{also served}} to help induce a {{convection}} draught through the boilers.|$|R

5|$|Drache {{was also}} used for {{shipboard}} trials with the Flettner Fl 282 Kolibri (Hummingbird) helicopter. She embarked the V6 and V10 prototypes for a period in 1942 and in January–February 1943. They used the small platform abaft <b>the</b> <b>funnel</b> to take-off and land. The Kriegsmarine (German navy) wished to evaluate their potential for anti-submarine warfare and mine reconnaissance, but visual detection proved to be possible only in clear weather.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{minutes after}} the first impact, the engines still turning astern, the ship struck again beneath the engine room, tearing open her bottom. She {{instantly}} broke in two just aft of the mainmast. <b>The</b> <b>funnel</b> went over the side and the forepart of the ship sank at once. The stern section, now crowded with men, floated {{for a few minutes}} before sinking.|$|E
5|$|The ships' hulls {{were divided}} into {{fourteen}} watertight compartments and had double bottoms that ran for 83percent {{of the length of}} their keels. Both vessels had side bulges and bulbous bows. They were constructed with longitudinal steel frames, and were more than 90percent welded in order to save weight. Nürnberg had a large, blocky forward superstructure, while Leipzigs superstructure resembled that of the preceding Königsberg class. Nürnberg also had a large searchlight platform fitted on <b>the</b> <b>funnel,</b> while Leipzig did not.|$|E
5|$|The Kronshtadt-class {{ships were}} {{provided}} with two KOR-2 flying boats which would be launched by the catapult mounted between <b>the</b> <b>funnels.</b>|$|R

5|$|Dreadnoughts tripod {{foremast}} {{was positioned}} behind <b>the</b> forward <b>funnel</b> to allow <b>the</b> vertical leg {{to serve as}} a support for the boat-handling derrick. This meant that <b>the</b> hot <b>funnel</b> gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable in conditions of little or no wind. The Bellerophons had the foremast moved forward of <b>the</b> <b>funnels</b> to reduce <b>the</b> problem in the spotting top and a second tripod mast was added to handle the derrick, but it had to be positioned in front of <b>the</b> aft <b>funnel</b> to do that, which rendered the aft spotting top almost useless as it could be exposed to the exhaust plumes from both funnels under certain circumstances.|$|R
5|$|While in drydock in July 1943, Type 21 air {{search radar}} was {{installed}} {{on the roof of}} the 10-meter rangefinder at the top of the pagoda mast. In August 1944, two Type 22 surface search radar units were {{installed on the}} pagoda mast and two Type 13 early warning radar units were fitted on <b>the</b> <b>funnel.</b> Fusō was the only Japanese battleship to mount radar on her funnel.|$|E
5|$|During the ship's refit in January 1944, her {{electronics}} were modernized. The CXAM {{was replaced}} by an SK model and the SC-1 {{was replaced by}} an SC-3. The forward SG was supplemented by an additional SG-1 mounted on a short mast at the aft end of <b>the</b> <b>funnel.</b> A lengthier overhaul in mid-1944 provided the opportunity to revise the radar arrangements. The SK radar {{was moved to the}} rebuilt foremast and the forward SG radar was replaced by an SG-1 mounted {{at the top of the}} foremast. An SM-1 fighter-control radar was mounted in the SK's former position and new antennas were added to the FD radars to allow them to determine target height. The SC-3 was replaced by an SC-4 in early 1945.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} she {{received}} her first radars. By August 1943 she mounted a Type 286 target indication set {{as well as a}} Type 285 anti-aircraft gunnery radar. By January 1944 she had received a Type 291 air warning radar. Her light AA armament had also been augmented by six Oerlikon 20 mm autocannon, three {{on each side of the}} roof of the large workshop abaft <b>the</b> <b>funnel.</b> In 1944 Vindictive was converted into a destroyer depot ship and her AA armament was reinforced by the addition of six more Oerlikons. Later that year, the 4-inch guns were removed and eight additional Oerlikons were added. In 1945 she received an additional six Oerlikons.|$|E
50|$|Fully loaded, {{original}} Baltimores displaced 17031 {{long ton}} t of water. Their draft was 23 ft. At the bow, {{the top level}} of the hull lay 33 ft above the water; at the stern, 25 ft. <b>The</b> <b>funnels</b> were 86 ft high, and the highest point on the masts was at 112 ft. The superstructure occupied {{about a third of}} the ship's length and was divided into two deckhouses. The gap between these housed <b>the</b> two thin <b>funnels.</b> Two masts, one a bit forward and the other a bit aft of <b>the</b> <b>funnels,</b> accommodated <b>the</b> positioning electronics.|$|R
50|$|She {{also had}} six 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes {{in the bow}} instead of the four 18 inch (457 mm) ones of the earlier members of the class, which {{required}} her to be 12 feet (4 m) longer. The four 18 inch (457 mm) beam tubes were nevertheless retained. The superstructure was modified to improve the protection of <b>the</b> <b>funnels</b> and uptakes, and almost cured the unfortunate tendency of water entering down <b>the</b> <b>funnels</b> putting <b>the</b> boiler fires out in bad weather.|$|R
5000|$|Martin {{introduces}} <b>the</b> knowledge <b>funnel</b> as <b>the</b> process {{followed by}} leading businesses to innovate more consistently and successfully. <b>The</b> knowledge <b>funnel</b> has three different phases: ...|$|R
5|$|Early warning {{would have}} been {{provided}} by a Type 2, Mark 2, Model 1 air search radar mounted {{at the top of}} the foremast. A Type 93 passive hydrophone system {{would have been}} fitted in the bow. The ships were designed to carry three aircraft on a platform between <b>the</b> <b>funnel</b> and the mainmast. These would have consisted of one three-seat Aichi E13A and two two-seat Yokosuka E14Y floatplanes. They would have been launched by a pair of aircraft catapults, one on each side of the aircraft platform.|$|E
5|$|Goeben {{returned}} fire shortly afterwards and hit Evstafi in {{the middle}} funnel; the shell detonated after it passed through <b>the</b> <b>funnel</b> and destroyed the antenna for the fire-control radio, which meant that Evstafi could not correct Ioann Zlatousts inaccurate range data. Goeben hit Evstafi four more times. although one shell failed to detonate, before Rear Admiral Wilhelm Souchon decided to turn away and break contact after fourteen minutes of combat. Evstafi suffered 34 killed and 24 wounded from those hits. Evstafi only fired between 12 and 16 12-inch shells as well as 14 eight-inch and 19 six-inch shells.|$|E
5|$|Swordfishs diving {{depth and}} time {{are not known}} because the records from her sea trials have not survived. Shutting down her boiler, {{retracting}} <b>the</b> <b>funnel</b> and sealing the boiler uptake required about {{a minute and a}} quarter, which included switching over to the electric motors. In marked contrast to contemporary Vickers designs much attention was paid to safety arrangements, including her extensive subdivision. Indicator and telephone buoys, which could be released from inside the submarine were provided together with external air connections and a charged high-pressure line which could provide air to any manned compartment or the living spaces. Furthermore, the main ballast tanks could be blown from either end of the ship.|$|E
50|$|The liveries {{were changed}} again in 2004. Pelorus Jack was {{relocated}} to the hull and <b>the</b> <b>funnels</b> were now blue with a fern replacing Pelorus Jack.|$|R
50|$|The island {{on these}} ships {{was small and}} cramped, and located well forward of <b>the</b> <b>funnels</b> (unlike on a normal-sized carrier where <b>the</b> <b>funnels</b> were {{integrated}} into the island). Although the first escort carriers had only one aircraft elevator, having two elevators (one fore and one aft), along with the single aircraft catapult, quickly became standard. The carriers employed the same system of arresting cables and tail hooks as on the big carriers, and procedures for launch and recovery {{were the same as}} well.|$|R
60|$|They {{looked out}} across the harbour. The smoke was pouring from <b>the</b> <b>funnels</b> of <b>the</b> destroyer. Already she had swung around and was {{steaming}} slowly towards the Channel.|$|R
5|$|The Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair was not {{convinced}} when {{the class was}} being designed that aircraft could effectively substitute as armament for a warship, especially at night or in bad weather that would prevent air operations. Thus the carriers' design included a substantial gun battery of eight 55-caliber Mk 9 eight-inch guns in four twin gun turrets. These turrets were mounted above the flight deck on the starboard side, two before the superstructure, and two behind <b>the</b> <b>funnel,</b> numbered I to IV from bow to stern. In theory the guns could fire to both sides, but {{it is probable that}} firing them to port would have damaged the flight deck. They could be depressed to −5° and elevated to +41°.|$|E
5|$|The eggs {{have large}} yolks; {{cleavage}} (division) is superficial and a germinal disc develops at the pole. During gastrulation, {{the margins of}} this grow down and surround the yolk, forming a yolk sac, which eventually forms part of the gut. The dorsal side of the disc grows upwards and forms the embryo, with a shell gland on its dorsal surface, gills, mantle and eyes. The arms and funnel develop {{as part of the}} foot on the ventral side of the disc. The arms later migrate upwards, coming to form a ring around <b>the</b> <b>funnel</b> and mouth. The yolk is gradually absorbed as the embryo develops.|$|E
5|$|The other port lifeboat, {{with four}} crew on board, {{was picked up}} by the steamer Leichhardt at an island at the {{entrance}} to Whitsunday Passage two days after the disaster. The steamer immediately reversed course back towards the wreck, which she reached at approximately 3.30pm on Friday, 26 February. Gothenburg was a complete wreck; <b>the</b> <b>funnel</b> was gone and she had sunk to the eyes of the lower rigging. Leichhardts Chief Officer and four hands went alongside, but nothing other than her masts could be seen above the water except for the body of a naked man floating nearby. They assumed the other victims had been taken by sharks. Leichhardt searched for survivors until last light and then made way for Bowen where the alarm was raised.|$|E
50|$|Like Bremen, Europa {{had a small}} {{seaplane}} {{launched from}} a catapult on her upper deck between <b>the</b> <b>funnels.</b> <b>The</b> airplane flew from the ship to a landing at the seaplane port in Blexen. The pilots and technicians gained experience later applied to equipping German warships with on-board aircraft.|$|R
60|$|Involuntarily I obeyed him, and {{we stood}} {{in the shadow of}} <b>the</b> great <b>funnel.</b> <b>The</b> captain had reached the rail.|$|R
25|$|One {{problem that}} arose during the {{conversion}} was a dispute between land-based and maritime unions over conversion jobs. The United States Coast Guard had final say. Queen Mary was deemed a building, {{since most of}} her propellers had been removed and her machinery gutted. The ship was also repainted with its red water level paint at a slightly higher level than previously. During <b>the</b> conversion <b>the</b> <b>funnels</b> were removed, as this area was needed to lift out the scrap materials from the engine and boiler rooms. Workers found that <b>the</b> <b>funnels</b> were significantly degraded and they were replaced with replicas.|$|R
