However, the main engine room was protected by a carbon dioxide fire suppression system and the excessive use of water prevented the fuel oil tanks below the main deck from exploding.

50|$|Because of {{the high}} {{pressures}} used in the steam circuits and the materials used, steam turbines and their casings have high thermal inertia. When warming up a steam turbine for use, the main steam stop valves (after the boiler) have a bypass line to allow superheated steam to slowly bypass the valve and proceed to heat up the lines in the system along with the steam turbine. Also, a <b>turning</b> <b>gear</b> is engaged {{when there is no}} steam to slowly rotate the turbine to ensure even heating to prevent uneven expansion. After first rotating the turbine by the <b>turning</b> <b>gear,</b> allowing time for the rotor to assume a straight plane (no bowing), then the <b>turning</b> <b>gear</b> is disengaged and steam is admitted to the turbine, first to the astern blades then to the ahead blades slowly rotating the turbine at 10-15 RPM (0.17-0.25 Hz) to slowly warm the turbine. The warm-up procedure for large steam turbines may exceed ten hours.|$|E

50|$|A jacking gear (also {{known as}} a <b>turning</b> <b>gear)</b> is a device placed on the main shaft of an engine or the rotor of a turbine. The jacking gear rotates the shaft or rotor and {{associated}} machinery (such as reduction gears and main turbines), to ensure uniform cool-down. Without turning, hogging or sagging can occur. Additionally, the jacking gear's assistance in rotation can be used when inspecting the shaft, reduction gears, bearings, and turbines. As an auxiliary function, the jacking gear also helps to maintain a protective oil membrane at all shaft journal bearings.|$|E

40|$|Figures {{presented}} periodically by {{classification societies}} show, {{a major cause}} of ship casualty to be stem bearing failure. This is particularly the case for large fall bodied bulk carriers and tankers. Non-uniform wake distribution around the stem of vessels causes uneven and constantly varying loads upon the bearing. These loads are examined and it is concluded that they may cause lubricant film breakdown and seal failures. Examination of stem bearing failures generally confirms this view and several bearing case histories are presented Present designs of stem bearings are appraised with the conclusion that all recent advances in stem bearing design have been for the purpose of improving maintainability rather than reliability. Examination of the loading pattern and the basic design requirements of stem gear indicate that the provision of jacking oil would considerably improve stem gear reliability. This is particularly aimed at reducing the frequency of failure caused by <b>turning</b> <b>gear</b> operation. Experimental work in which oil film thickness measurements were taken on the aftermost bearing of a container ship is presented. This clearly demonstrates the problem of <b>turning</b> <b>gear</b> damage. Furthermore the shaft movements recorded at this plummer bearing show that considerable tallshaft lift (the full stem bearing clearance is taken up) occurs and that the tailskaft probably executes a closed loop under the action of the propeller. Design curves are given to show the lubricating oil pressures and quantities required. It is further postulated that, within the framework of existing classification society rules full hydrostatic lubrication would have even greater advantages. Design curves to a basis of shaft diameter are presented to enable clearance, pressure, lubricant flow, stiffness and basic dimensions to be derived by simple calculation. Experimental data on suitable materials are given and an overall material specification produced. Designs are given for three typical ship types and based upon these, cost comparisons made. Costs are such that an economic as well as technical case can be advanced for the use of hydrostatic stern bearings...|$|E

So, PT PLN (Persero) {{have to be able to}} fulfill the public demands for electrical energy. One of the power generation existed is Steam PowerGeneration. The condition of power generation depended on the maintenance, so, well maintenance made power plant operated at ease condition. Production process in SteamPower Generation of Ombilin used a closed cycle or continuous process. If a machine or an equipment damaged, it will stop the whole function. In the production process, the company involved several main engines are boiler, turbine, condenser, and generator. But the damage often occurs in turbine engine which caused the generation power in Steam PowerGeneration of Ombilin can not operate. Therefore, it needs a maintenance action of machinery/equipment to be able to prevent the damage. The right strategy to keep the engine operating is determining the optimal maintenance interval of equipment for minimizing downtime. The stages of this research begin by determining the critical engine with Criticality Analysis method. Then, the determination of the critical components using Pareto diagram. Then, the determination of the probability density function (pdf) and the reliability of critical components. After that, the determination of maintenance intervals of the critical components by using the criterion of minimizing the downtime that will be used to make maintenance scheduling. Based on the processing data has been done, it was found that the critical engine is a turbine engine with a total value is 44 and the critical components of a turbine engine are membrane turbine, bearing and <b>turning</b> <b>gear</b> with the examination time interval for each critical component are 960. 48 hours (40 days), 908. 57 hours (37 days) and 1150. 28 hours (48 days).

40|$|LecturePg. 123 - 132 Two similar large steam {{turbines}} in an ethylene plant are profiled. One drives the cracked gas compressor train {{and the other}} drives the propylene refrigeration compressor. The two machines are similar and this paper concentrates on the turbine driving the cracked gas compressors. Both turbines {{had a history of}} high vibration, short bearing life, and unusual sensitivity to thermal changes and imbalance due to operation near the second critical speed. In addition, numerous blade failures had occurred. When additional turbine performance was required, a complete review of the entire turbine including the blade designs, rotordynarnics, and governor operation was commissioned. The performance upgrade included new blading, disks, seals, and other changes to the steam path. A <b>turning</b> <b>gear</b> was added for slow-roll operation to relieve thermal effects and rotor bow. A technique was developed for mounting the turbine disks on the rotor to minimize axial disk runout and local couple imbalances. The high bearing temperatures and high vibration issues were addressed with changes in shaft and bearing designs. A submerged arc welding process increased the governor end journal diameter from 51 / 4 inches to 7 inches. A rotordynamic optimization analysis resulted in replacing the tilting pad bearing on the governor end with an offset-half lobed journal bearing. The tilting pad bearings on the exhaust end of the turbines were retained but redesigned for optimum performance. Interchangeability of bearings between the two machines was maintained. These shaft and bearing changes resulted in a significant reduction in babbitt temperature, shaft vibration, and imbalance sensitivity as well as control of the second critical speed. The interaction of the rotor with the foundation substructure was found to be significant, and its inclusion in the analysis was required to properly design the optimized bearings. The blade design changes and steam path changes produced a more reliable design and greater than the required extra power. The addition of a <b>turning</b> <b>gear</b> drive has eliminated the thermal bow problems. A new electronic governor system has eliminated the wear associated with the original hydraulic governor. Both turbines are now operating very smoothly at the capacity of the production facility...|$|E

Vibration amplitude during compressor restart is then calculated with the traditional tools used for rotordynamic analysis, by unbalancing the rotor according to FEA results.
