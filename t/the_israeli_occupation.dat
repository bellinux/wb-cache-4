In 1982 the mayor was dismissed and the municipal council of Deir al-Balah was disbanded and replaced by an Israeli military-appointed administration. During the course of <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>occupation,</b> Deir al-Balah's urban areas extended into lands designated for agriculture, {{largely as a result of}} building restrictions which hindered organized expansion.|$|E

5|$|During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Nablus {{came under}} Jordanian control. Thousands of Palestinian {{refugees}} fleeing from areas captured by Israel arrived in Nablus, settling {{in refugee camps}} {{in and around the}} city. Its population doubled and the influx of refugees put a heavy strain on the city's resources. Three such camps still located within the city limits today are Ein Beit al-Ma', Balata and Askar. During the Jordanian period, the adjacent villages of Rafidia, Balata al-Balad, al-Juneid and Askar were annexed to the Nablus municipality. The 1967 Six-Day War ended in <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>occupation</b> of Nablus. Many Israeli settlements were built around Nablus during the 1980s and early 1990s. The restrictions placed on Nablus during the First Intifada were met by a back-to-the-land movement to secure self-sufficiency, and had a notable outcome in boosting local agricultural production.|$|E
5|$|In late 1956, {{parliamentary}} elections in Jordan resulted in major victories for Arab nationalist and other left-leaning parties. Hussein subsequently appointed Suleiman Nabulsi, an Arab nationalist, socialist {{and one of}} the leading pro-Nasser MP-elects, as prime minister in October. Roughly coinciding with Nabulsi's appointment, the British, French and Israelis launched a tripartite invasion of the Suez Canal and the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt, mainly in response to Nasser's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company among other reasons. Hussein {{declared a state of emergency}} and his opposition against the invasion and agreed to Egyptian chief of staff Abdel Hakim Amer's request for Jordanian military intervention. To that end, Hussein instructed Abu Nuwar to immediately execute Amer's order to launch Operation Beisan, which entailed a Jordanian-Syrian armored invasion of the Israeli coastal plain, which was seen as Israel's most vulnerable region due to the short length between the coast and the Jordanian-held West Bank. However, Abu Nuwar viewed the operation as far too risky for the Jordanian army and advised Hussein to await Syria's adherence to the plan; Egypt, Syria and Jordan had formed a defense pact days before <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>occupation</b> of Sinai on 29 October.|$|E
