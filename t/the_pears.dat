25|$|Worcestershire {{failed to}} gain {{promotion}} in 2000, despite overseas signing Glenn McGrath taking 76 Championship wickets {{at an average}} of 13.77. In 2003, Worcestershire were promoted to County Championship Division One for the first time after winning the Division Two title. Worcestershire also reached the final of the Cheltenham & Gloucester trophy, beating Lancashire in a memorable semi-final at New Road on 9 August 2003. There was disappointment in the Lord's final, though, as Worcestershire lost by seven wickets and <b>the</b> <b>Pears</b> were also relegated from Division One of the National League. 2004 was a yo-yo year with Worcestershire relegated in the County Championship, promoted back to Division One in the rebranded totesport League and losing finalists again in the C Trophy. Vikram Solanki scored centuries in both the semi-final win against Warwickshire and the final against Gloucestershire, but the 'Gladiators' won by eight wickets at Lord's.|$|E
25|$|Worcestershire's success {{continued}} into the 1990s, with a first ever success in the Benson and Hedges Cup in 1991, following final defeats in 1973, 1976 and 1990. Captained by Phil Neale, <b>the</b> <b>Pears</b> beat Lancashire by 65 runs in the final at Lord's, gaining revenge for defeat against Lancashire in the previous year's competition. Worcestershire's next title came in 1994 when they won the Natwest Trophy, beating arch-rivals Warwickshire in the final. Not only did they avenge their defeat {{at the hands of}} Warwickshire in the B Cup Final earlier that summer but it was also their first success in the competition after three previous final defeats. Worcestershire's best showing in the County Championship came in 1993 when they finished second to Middlesex. Worcestershire finished 15th in 1999, the final year of single division County Championship cricket, meaning they would start the new millennium in Division Two.|$|E

Arthur Pears was a civil engineer and successful businessman, who spent much of his time working overseas. The biographers Christopher Headington and Donald Mitchell both remark on two contrasting strands in Pears's heredity: the Luard family was notable for its naval and military connexions, and on <b>the</b> <b>Pears</b> side there was a strong religious tradition, both Anglican and Quaker.

2500|$|An {{unpublished}} {{biography of}} Richard [...] "Rock" [...] Taylor by Mrs. Elizabeth Bray describes earliest farming conditions, the crude cow-houses, crude shelters for crops, and suitable fruit trees, mostly {{applicable to the}} neighboring larger Hallett farm. [...] A cow-house (barn) only sheltered the cows and other stock; the fodder (usually salt hay) was stacked outside. [...] The crops (corn) were stored in crude shelters made of poles with only the roof made of boards. [...] The Kentish cherry trees were planted {{around the edge of}} the orchard to protect the less hardy trees within. [...] The apple trees were often inferior seedlings, but could be good Pignoses (winter apple) or Foxwell (fall apple), or grafts on the inferior seedlings. [...] <b>The</b> <b>pears</b> were also inferior seedlings, but there were grafts of the French Sugar Pear and the Black Worcester, and later the Catherine (from Boston) and the Orange; the trees were hardy and long-lived.|$|E

40|$|Evapotranspiration from <b>the</b> trellised Japanese <b>pear</b> orchard was {{measured}} with some meteorological elements during May to November 1989. The meteorological elements were measured at {{the upper and lower}} parts of <b>the</b> <b>pear</b> trellis as shown in Fig. 1. The evapotranspiration was evaluated by measuring the transpiration from <b>the</b> young <b>pear</b> tree growing in plastic pot set on the same level as <b>pear</b> trellis and <b>the</b> evapotranspiration from the grass pot placed on the ground. The air temperature of upper part of <b>the</b> <b>pear</b> trellis was higher than that of lower part during the period from sunrise to around 14 : 00 at which the air temperature was maximum. During the night, this relation was reversed. The net radiation of upper part of <b>the</b> <b>pear</b> trellis was more than that of lower part. However, the difference in net radiation between both upper and lower parts of <b>the</b> <b>pear</b> trellis was decreased by the defoliation of <b>the</b> <b>pear</b> tree. <b>The</b> transpiration from <b>pear</b> tree was 2. 4 mm/day on the average from June to August, followed by a gradual decrease. The evapotranspiration from grass surfce under <b>the</b> <b>pear</b> trellis decreased from 4. 7 mm/day at May to 1. 7 mm/day at middle of November. The ratio (T/ET) of transpiration (T) from pear tree to evapotranspiration (ET) from <b>the</b> <b>pear</b> orchard increased with the increase in the leaf area index of <b>the</b> <b>pear</b> trellis. To find a simple method to estimate evapotranspiration from <b>the</b> trellised <b>pear</b> orchard, adaptabilities of Priestley and Taylor method and solar radiation method were examined.

5000|$|The {{origins of}} this variety are uncertain.
