5|$|He {{assisted}} {{in the development of}} the atomic bomb during World War II and became known to a wide public in the 1980s as a member of the Rogers Commission, the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. Along with his work in <b>theoretical</b> <b>physics,</b> Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum computing and introducing the concept of nanotechnology. He held the Richard C. Tolman professorship in <b>theoretical</b> <b>physics</b> at the California Institute of Technology.|$|E
5|$|To {{build up}} the <b>theoretical</b> <b>physics</b> {{department}} at the University of Michigan, Randall recruited four distinguished young physicists to work at Ann Arbor in 1927: Otto Laporte, George Uhlenbeck, Samuel Goudsmit, and David M. Dennison. The University of Michigan {{was no longer a}} backwater in <b>theoretical</b> <b>physics.</b> Bacher immediately signed up for Goudsmit's course on atomic structure. With Goudsmit he investigated the Zeeman effect of hyperfine structure of atomic levels, which became the subject of his 1930 PhD thesis.|$|E

5|$|In {{algebraic}} geometry and <b>theoretical</b> <b>physics,</b> mirror symmetry {{is a relationship}} between geometric objects called Calabi–Yau manifolds. The term refers to a situation where two Calabi–Yau manifolds look very different geometrically but are nevertheless equivalent when employed as extra dimensions of string theory.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Scandinavian {{countries}} {{formed the}} Nordic Institute for <b>Theoretical</b> <b>Physics</b> in 1957, with Bohr as its chairman.

5|$|Bohr {{founded the}} Institute of <b>Theoretical</b> <b>Physics</b> at the University of Copenhagen, {{now known as}} the Niels Bohr Institute, which opened in 1920. Bohr mentored and collaborated with {{physicists}} including Hans Kramers, Oskar Klein, George de Hevesy, and Werner Heisenberg. He predicted the existence of a new zirconium-like element, which was named hafnium, after the Latin name for Copenhagen, where it was discovered. Later, the element bohrium was named after him.|$|E

5|$|By 1908, he was {{recognized}} as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the University of Bern. The following year, after giving a lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the University of Zürich, Alfred Kleiner recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship in <b>theoretical</b> <b>physics.</b> Einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to being an idea of considerable theoretical interest, M-theory provides a framework for constructing models of real world physics that combine general relativity with the standard model of particle physics. Phenomenology is the branch of <b>theoretical</b> <b>physics</b> in which physicists construct realistic models of nature from more abstract theoretical ideas. String phenomenology {{is the part of}} string theory that attempts to construct realistic models of particle physics based on string and M-theory.|$|E
5|$|In <b>theoretical</b> <b>physics,</b> the anti-de Sitter/conformal {{field theory}} correspondence, {{sometimes}} called Maldacena duality or gauge/gravity duality, is a conjectured relationship between {{two kinds of}} physical theories. On one side are anti-de Sitter spaces (AdS) which are used in theories of quantum gravity, formulated in terms of string theory or M-theory. On {{the other side of}} the correspondence are conformal field theories (CFT) which are quantum field theories, including theories similar to the Yang–Mills theories that describe elementary particles.|$|E

5|$|The {{issue of}} the radius of the {{electron}} is a challenging problem of the modern <b>theoretical</b> <b>physics.</b> The admission of the hypothesis of a finite radius of the electron is incompatible to the premises {{of the theory of}} relativity.

5|$|The most {{familiar}} condensed phases are solids and liquids while more exotic condensed phases include the superconducting phase exhibited by certain materials at low temperature, the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of spins on crystal lattices of atoms, and the Bose–Einstein condensate found in ultracold atomic systems.

5|$|When Kramers {{left the}} Institute in 1926 {{to take up}} a chair as {{professor}} of <b>theoretical</b> <b>physics</b> at the Utrecht University, Bohr arranged for Heisenberg to return and take Kramers's place as a lektor at the University of Copenhagen.

5|$|After {{completing}} his education, {{he served as}} a professor of physics and electrical engineering at the University of Southern California beginning in 1966, specializing in the <b>theoretical</b> <b>physics</b> of nonlinear optics and quantum optics, and co-founded the Center for Laser Studies at that institution. He rose to become chairman of the physics department in 1972, and then dean of the College of Letters, Arts and Sciences in 1976.

5|$|As a scientist, Oppenheimer {{is remembered}} by his {{students}} and colleagues {{as being a}} brilliant researcher and engaging teacher who was the founder of modern <b>theoretical</b> <b>physics</b> in the United States. Because his scientific attentions often changed rapidly, he never worked long enough on any one topic and carried it to fruition to merit the Nobel Prize, although his investigations contributing {{to the theory of}} black holes may have warranted the prize had he lived long enough to see them brought into fruition by later astrophysicists. An asteroid, 67085 Oppenheimer, was named in his honor, as was the lunar crater Oppenheimer.|$|E
5|$|Bohr died {{of heart}} failure {{at his home in}} Carlsberg on 18 November 1962. He was cremated, and his ashes were buried in the family plot in the Assistens Cemetery in the Nørrebro section of Copenhagen, along with those of his parents, his brother Harald, and his son Christian.
