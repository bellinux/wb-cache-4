40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a novel {{watermarking}} scheme for image authentication. A high localization of <b>tampering</b> <b>detection</b> is achieved by applying a random permutation process where every embedded watermark bit verifies random image positions instead of a local image block. Thereby the resolution of <b>tampering</b> <b>detection</b> is significantly improved in comparison to existing solutions while keeping the payload low. Furthermore, the proposed scheme doesn't embed the watermark locally but distributes it into the suitable embedding wavelet coefficients, avoiding embedding in smooth regions. Therefore, the scheme is intrinsically secure to block-based local attacks and retains high fidelity of the watermarked image. Scalable sensitivity of <b>tampering</b> <b>detection</b> is also enabled in the authentication process. Experimental results demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the scheme for image authentication...|$|R

In the era of internet communication, systems should able to protect content such as pictures, videos against malicious modifications during their transmission. One of the important problems addressed in this is the authentication of the image received in a Communication. <b>Tampering</b> <b>detection</b> has significance in authentication of image. This paper presents support vector machine (SVM) based <b>tampering</b> <b>detection</b> system. In this a robust alignment (registration) method is proposed which makes use of an image hash component based on the Bag of Features (BOF) paradigm to localize the tampering. These BOF are clustered for effective image alignment. The support vector machine is optimal partitioning based linear classifier and at least theoretically better other classifier because only small numbers of classes required during classification SVM. The proposed signature {{is attached to the}} image before transmission and then analyzed at destination to recover the geometric transformations which have been applied to the received image.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} {{hierarchical}} fragile watermarking scheme for image authentication with localization and recovery. Two phases are exploited for pixel-wise and block-wise authenticity. By applying the singular value decomposition (SVD), {{only a few}} pixels need to be modified to carry these watermark bits so we can produce high quality of the watermarked image and achieve the integrity verification of blocks. Pixel-wise <b>tampering</b> <b>detection</b> and recovery is also realized in this proposed scheme. Altered pixels in each block can be exactly localized using the authentication bits. Accordingly, unaltered pixels remain unchanged but only altered pixels need to be recovered. In the image recovery stage, instead of replacing the whole block identified as tampered, elements belonging to associated VQ codeword are restored for those altered pixels. In this way, the quality of recovered image is better than replacing whole altered block by a whole vector quantization block. The experimental results reveal that the average PSNR values of reconstructed images are {{higher than that of}} other schemes.

40|$|Recent image {{forensic}} research {{has resulted in}} a number of <b>tampering</b> <b>detection</b> techniques utilizing cues culled from understanding of various natural image characteristics and modeling of tampering artifacts.

By fusing multiple cues, the <b>tampering</b> <b>detection</b> process does not rely entirely on a single detector and hence can be robust in face of missing or unreliable detectors. In this paper, we propose a statistical fusion framework based on Discriminative Random Fields (DRF) to integrate multiple cues suitable for forgery detection, such as double quantization artifacts and camera response function inconsistency. The detection results using individual cues are used as observation from which the DRF model parameters and the most likely node labels are inferred indicating whether a local block belongs to a tampered foreground or the authentic background. Such inference results also provide information about localization of the suspect spliced regions. The proposed framework is effective and general- outperforming individual detectors over systematic evaluation and easily extensible to other detectors using different cues...|$|R
