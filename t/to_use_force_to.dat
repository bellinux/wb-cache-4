5|$|Although Operation Backstop {{was within}} the UNPROFOR mandate (since the peacekeepers were {{authorised}} <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>force</b> <b>to</b> prevent armed incursions into the UNPAs), Croatian authorities resented the operation.

25|$|Ireland {{became a}} member of the United Nations in December 1955, after having been denied {{membership}} because of its neutral stance during the Second World War and not supporting the Allied cause.

In his speeches Buth Diu quoted NUP campaign promises supporting a Federal system in which the southern provinces would have considerable autonomy. Prime minister Azhari described this as seditious talk and threatened <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>force</b> <b>to</b> prevent secession from Sudan by the south. In May 1955 Isma'il al-Azhari announced that Sudan would seek complete independence, a reversal of the earlier NUP position in favor of union with Egypt.|$|E
5|$|John became king in 1199 after Richard's death. William de Ferrers, 4th Earl of Derby {{maintained}} {{the claim of}} the Earls of Derby to the Peveril estates. He paid King John 2000marks (£1333) for the lordship of the Peak, but the Crown retained possession of Peveril and Bolsover Castles. John finally gave Ferrers these castles in 1216 to secure his support {{in the face of}} country-wide rebellion. However, the castellan Brian de Lisle refused to hand them over. Although de Lisle and Ferrers were both King John's supporters, the king gave Ferrers permission <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>force</b> <b>to</b> retake the castles.|$|E

5|$|Diplomacy failed despite {{continuing}} pressure {{applied by}} the Allies against Athens. On 24 November, du Fournet presented a 7-day ultimatum demanding the immediate surrender {{of at least}} ten Greek mountain artillery batteries. Du Fournet was instructed not <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>force</b> <b>to</b> take possession of the batteries. The admiral made a last effort to persuade the king to accept France's demands. He advised the king that he would land an Allied contingent, and occupy certain positions in Athens until all the demands were accepted by Greece. The king said that the citizens of Greece, {{as well as the}} army, were against disarmament, and only promised that the Greek forces would not attack the Allies.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{invasion}} of the South Korea by North Korea on June 25, 1950, the UN voted <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>force</b> <b>to</b> defend South Korea. The United States, a member of the UN, simultaneously committed ground forces to the Korean peninsula with the goal of pushing back the North Korean invasion and preventing South Korea from collapsing. But US forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II, five years earlier, and at the time the closest force was the 24th Infantry Division, headquartered in Japan. The division was understrength, and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. Nevertheless, the 24th was ordered to South Korea.|$|E
5|$|William Peveril the Younger {{inherited}} his father's estates, but in 1155 {{they were}} confiscated by King HenryII. While in royal possession, Henry visited the castle in 1157, 1158, and 1164, {{the first time}} hosting King MalcolmIV of Scotland. During the Revolt of 1173–1174, the castle's garrison was increased from a porter and two watchmen to a force led by 20 knights shared with the castles of Bolsover and Nottingham. The Earls of Derby had a claim to the Peveril family's estates through marriage, and in 1199 William de Ferrers, the fourth earl, paid 2,000 marks for the Peak lordship, although the castle remained under royal control. The closest Peveril Castle came to seeing battle was in 1216, when King John gave the castle to William de Ferrers, but the castellan refused to relinquish control. Although they were both John's supporters, the king authorised the earl <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>force</b> <b>to</b> evict the castellan, who eventually capitulated, {{although there is no}} evidence that the castle was assaulted.|$|E

Materially, the Hopi region was just as poor as the Zuni in precious metals, but the Spaniards did learn that a large river (the Colorado) lay to the west.|$|R

5000|$|Shoenfield's theorem {{also shows}} that {{there are limits to}} the {{independence}} results that can be obtained by forcing. In particular, any sentence of Peano arithmetic is absolute to transitive models of set theory with the same ordinals. Thus it is not possible <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>forcing</b> <b>to</b> change the truth value of arithmetical sentences, as forcing does not change the ordinals of the model to which it is applied. Many famous open problems, such as the Riemann hypothesis and the P = NP problem, can be expressed as [...] sentences (or sentences of lower complexity), and thus cannot be proven independent of ZFC by forcing.|$|R

This led to a debate within the party and resulted in an official statement that fell short of supporting the pro-capitalist republican government, but offering general support to workers in their struggle for democracy.|$|E
