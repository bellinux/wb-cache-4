Comparisons are then made with South America, and consideration is given to how certain distributions might have come about. Noting that the collection contains around 250 new species and about 32 new genera, yet no new family, Brown concludes with the observation {{that there are no}} plant families endemic to tropical Africa.|$|E
25|$|After World War I, Allen County's {{population}} growth lagged {{the state and}} the nation. Galvin was an assistant superintendent at the Peru Steel Casting Co. of Peru, Ind. He then became acting manager at American Steel Foundries in Pittsburgh. In 1921, Lima voters approved a change in the structure of Lima city government. Voters now elected five commissioners, with the commission chair serving as mayor. The charter sought to establish professional management, requiring the commissioners to hire a city manager, who reported to the mayor. Lima proved itself <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> in the Progressive tradition with these changes, after flirting with radicalism in 1912 when the voters elected a Socialist mayor.|$|E

25|$|Hundreds {{of people}} {{gathered}} on the route to pay their last respects to Swami Lakshmanananda. Riots erupted when the procession passed through localities with Christian populations. Christians, who were perceived to be Indian National Congress party supporters, were targeted everywhere; in some places many Hindu families were also attacked because they were Congress supporters. The attackers included activists of the VHP, the Bajrang Dal and other Sangh Parivar organisations, and workers of the BJP that was {{a partner in the}} government headed by Naveen Patnaik. The violence also saw attacks on Christians who belonged to the Scheduled Castes and on people who claimed tribal status {{on the grounds that they}} spoke the Kui language of the Kondha tribal people. The Kui Samaj, which unites members of the native Kondh tribe in Kandhamal, was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> on the side of the VHP and the ruling alliance.|$|E
25|$|A town {{grew up in}} {{the shadow}} of the castle, made up {{primarily}} of settlers from England. Cardiff had a population of between 1,500 and 2,000 in the Middle Ages, a relatively normal size for a Welsh town in this period. It was the centre of the Norman Marcher Lordship of Glamorgan and by the end of the 13th century, Cardiff was the only town in Wales with a population exceeding 2,000, although it remained relatively small compared with most notable towns in the Kingdom of England, and continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> contained by its walls, which has begun as a wooden palisade in the early 12th century. It was none-the-less of sufficient size and importance to be awarded a series of charters, notably in 1331 by William La Zouche, Lord of Glamorgan through marriage with the de Clare family, Edward III in 1359, then Henry IV in 1400, and later Henry VI. In no small part due to the historic Anglicisation of the town, in 1404 Owain Glyndŵr burned Cardiff and took possession of the Castle. As many buildings in the town were made of timber, and tightly packed together within the town walls, much of Cardiff was destroyed. Ironically given the treatment of Cardiff by Glyndwr, a statue of him was erected in Cardiff Town Hall in the early twentieth century, reflecting the complex and often conflicting cultural identity Cardiff has as the capital of Wales. However, the town was soon rebuilt on the same street plan and began to flourish once again. In addition to serving an important political role in the governance of the fertile south Glamorgan coastal plain, Cardiff was a busy port in the Middle Ages due to its location on the Bristol trading routes, and was declared a Staple port in 1327. This furthermore led to the town gaining a reputation for piracy, which by the Early Modern period led to much dispute between the burgesses of Cardiff and the surrounding county families.|$|E

During her set {{it was reported}} she was unsteady on her feet and had trouble remembering lyrics. She apologised to the crowd for being [...] "bored" [...] and ended the set {{in the middle of}} a song. To a cheering crowd on 23 August at the V festival, Winehouse sang with The Specials on their songs [...] "You're Wondering Now" [...] and [...] "Ghost Town." [...] During her stay in Saint Lucia, she also worked on new music with Salaam Remi. Island claimed that a new album would be due in 2010 with Island co-president Darcus Beese saying, [...] "I've heard a couple of song demos that have absolutely floored me." [...] In July 2010, Winehouse was quoted as saying her next album would be released no later than January 2011, saying [...] "It's going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> the same as my second album, where there's a lot of jukebox stuff and songs that are... just jukebox, really." [...] Ronson said the same month however that he had not started to record the album. She performed [...] "Valerie" [...] with Ronson at a movie premiere but forgot some of the song's lyrics. In October Winehouse performed a four-song set to promote her fashion line. In December 2010, she played a 40-minute concert at a Russian oligarch's party in Moscow, the tycoon hand picking the songs.|$|E

2500|$|The {{battle was}} the result of {{multiple}} failures of diplomacy {{in the latter half of}} the 18th century. At the beginning of 1801, during the French Revolutionary Wars, Britain's principal advantage over France was its naval superiority. The Royal Navy searched neutral ships trading with French ports, seizing their cargoes if they were deemed to be trading with France. It was in the British interest to guarantee its naval supremacy and all trade advantages that resulted from it. The Russian Tsar Paul, having been a British ally, arranged a League of Armed Neutrality comprising Denmark, Sweden, Prussia, and Russia, to enforce free trade with France. [...] The British viewed the League <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> in the French interest and a serious threat. The League was hostile to the British blockade and, according to the British, its existence threatened the supply of timber and naval stores from Scandinavia.|$|E
2500|$|Preserving Frescati proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{an uphill}} battle. The {{campaign}} continued, involving several lengthy court battles and petitions. One historian in Trinity College prepared a thesis for a Masters degree {{based on the}} Frescati situation. She was asked in court how she felt about the possible destruction of Frescati's wings. [...] "Bluntly", she replied, [...] "It's vandalism. What else could one say {{of the destruction of}} good things left by our ancestors which are built to last?” A petition was presented in court that contained thousands of signatures from Ireland and abroad. It was argued that Frescati was structurally sound but that much work needed to be done inside. [...] "Princess" [...] Mariga Guinness of the Irish Georgian Society said that she had several inquiries from people who wanted to live in Frescati. She added that she had seen buildings such as the British Embassy and Holy Cross, which were in a much worse state of repair, restored.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1887, volumes III and IV of Creighton's History of the Papacy were {{published}} by Longmans. [...] These volumes narrowed the focus to specific popes, chiefly, Sixtus IV, Alexander VI, and Julius II. [...] In his characteristic approach of maintaining historiographical balance and considering individuals <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> mired in their historical eras, Creighton did not single out anyone for especial condemnation, even Alexander VI, whose great disrepute Creighton felt was [...] "largely {{due to the}} fact that he did not add hypocrisy to his other vices." [...] Earlier, in 1885, Creighton had agreed to become the first editor of a new journal, the English Historical Review. [...] Now, he requested Acton to review his two volumes for the journal. [...] The review Acton wrote was not only hostile, but, in Creighton's view, also obscure. [...] In the following weeks, there were contentious exchanges between the two men, polarising eventually into their two views of history, Acton's normative approach versus Creighton's more relativist one. [...] It was in one of these exchanges that Acton penned three sentences, one of which was to become an oft-quoted epigram. [...] "Historical responsibility," [...] wrote Acton, [...] "has to make up for the want of legal responsibility. [...] Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. [...] Great men are almost always bad men, even when they exercise influence and not authority." [...] Acton's attack, however, did lead Creighton to rethink his own position somewhat. [...] In an 1895 paper, he would write that the papacy, [...] "which had been established for the promotion of morality" [...] had in fact [...] "provided the means for the utmost immorality." ...|$|E

While liberals believe that, on sexual matters, [...] "the Pope can teach whatever he wants... but whether or not he should <b>be</b> listened <b>to</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> an open question", the stance of certain traditionalists on the reform of the Mass liturgy and contemporary teachings on ecumenism and religious liberty amounts to the view that, on these issues, [...] "faithful Catholics <b>are</b> always free <b>to</b> resist Pope's folly....
