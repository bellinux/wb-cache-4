5|$|Progress M1-5 was {{launched}} by a Soyuz-U carrier rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan. It was originally scheduled for launch on 16 January 2001, {{but by the}} first week of January, it was targeting 18 January. It was rolled out to <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> <b>pad</b> on 16 January, with the rocket departing the MIK assembly facility at Site 2 of the cosmodrome at 02:00 GMT, and was erected at <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> <b>pad,</b> Site 1/5, within two hours of the start of rollout. Launch was set for 06:56:26 GMT on 18 January.|$|E

5|$|On 22 August 2008, after a delay {{following}} Tropical Storm Fay, Atlantis was rolled {{from the}} Orbiter Processing Facility to the Vehicle Assembly Building, {{where it was}} mated to the external fuel tank and solid rocket booster stack. Problems were encountered during the mating process, and poor weather due to Hurricane Hanna caused a delay in the rollout of Atlantis to <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> <b>pad,</b> which is normally done seven days after rollover.|$|E
5|$|On 4 February, the CryoSat-2 {{spacecraft}} was fuelled for launch. Then on 10 February it {{was attached}} to the payload adaptor, and encapsulated in the payload fairing, to form a unit known as the Space Head Module. This was transported to <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> <b>pad</b> by means of a vehicle known as the crocodile, and installed atop the carrier rocket. Rollout occurred on 15 February, and the next day the satellite was activated in order to test its systems following integration onto the rocket.|$|E
5|$|The launch had {{originally}} been scheduled for August 4, 1983, and was later rescheduled for August 20. The requirement to conduct testing with the TDRS system required a delay of ten days for the system to be ready, during which the stack remained on <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> <b>pad.</b> During the on-pad delay, Hurricane Barry (1983) hit the Florida coastline, making landfall {{just south of the}} Kennedy Space Center on the morning of August 25. The storm had only been identified two days earlier, and {{there was no time to}} roll Challenger back from the pad; the decision was made to secure the launch stack and ride out the storm.|$|E
50|$|On 21 October 2012, the Soyuz-FG {{rocket booster}} with Soyuz TMA-06M {{spacecraft}} was rolled out by train and erected on pad 6 at Site 31, {{also referred to}} as <b>the</b> Tereshkova <b>pad.</b> <b>Launch</b> <b>pad</b> 31/6 was used for this mission since <b>the</b> usual <b>launch</b> <b>pad</b> for manned flights - pad 5 at Site 1 was undergoing maintenance and upgrades. Also on <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> day, <b>the</b> crew’s trip to <b>the</b> 31/6 <b>Launch</b> <b>Pad</b> took about one hour and 10 minutes - 50 minutes longer than the drive to <b>the</b> 1/5 <b>Launch</b> <b>Pad.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{culmination}} of Thor missile training was {{to participate in}} a missile launch. Originally it was intended that all Thor missile crews would carry out at least one launch, but it soon became apparent that the cost would be prohibitive. Nonetheless, 21 RAF crews visited the United States for training, culminating in operational training launches from Vandenberg. This was known as Integrated Weapons System Training (IWST). The first of these launches was a launch codenamed Lions Roar. Despite the fact that a Thor missile had exploded on <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> <b>pad</b> just a few days before, the launch was viewed by dignitaries including Brigadier Godfrey Hobbs, the Director of Public Relations at the Ministry of Defence; Air Vice-Marshal Walter Sheen, the RAF commander at the British Joint Staff Mission; and Air Vice-Marshal Augustus Walker, the commander of No. 1 Group. After delays due to weather and technical problems, the missile was successfully launched on 16 April 1959. In all, there were nine IWST launches, the last of which, codenamed Red Caboose, was on 21 January 1960.|$|E
5|$|The {{launch of}} Apollo 16 was delayed one month from March 17 to April 16. This {{was the first}} launch delay in the Apollo program due to a {{technical}} problem. During the delay, the space suits, a spacecraft separation mechanism and batteries in the Lunar Module (LM) were modified and tested. There were concerns that the explosive mechanism designed to separate the docking ring from the Command Module (CM) would not create enough pressure to completely sever the ring. This, along with a dexterity issue in Young's space suit and fluctuations in {{the capacity of the}} Lunar Module batteries, required investigation and trouble-shooting. In January 1972, three months before the planned April launch date, a fuel tank in the Command Module was accidentally damaged during a routine test. The rocket was returned to the Vertical Assembly Building (VAB) and the fuel tank replaced, and the rocket returned to <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> <b>pad</b> in February in time for the scheduled launch.|$|E
5|$|Four Black Arrows were {{launched}} between 1969 and 1971. The first two launches were demonstration flights, with battleship third stages and a boilerplate payload. On {{the first flight}} an electrical fault caused a pair of first stage combustion chambers to pivot back and forth. Before it cleared <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> <b>pad,</b> the rocket was rolling erratically, and about a minute later it began to disintegrate. After the first stage engine failed, and the rocket began to fall back to earth, it was destroyed by range safety. The second launch was successful. The first all-up launch on 2 September 1970 was the third launch of the Black Arrow, and Britain's first attempt to launch a satellite. The launch failed due to a leak in the second stage oxidiser pressurisation system, which caused it to cut out early. The third stage fired, but the rocket did not reach orbit, and re-entered over the Gulf of Carpentaria. The fourth launch successfully orbited the Prospero satellite, making the United Kingdom the sixth nation to place a satellite into orbit {{by means of an}} indigenously developed carrier rocket. The satellite, also known as X-3, was named Prospero after the character Prospero in Shakespeare's The Tempest. The name was chosen as a reference to events in the play, in which Prospero, a sorcerer, gives up his powers. Prior to the cancellation of the Black Arrow programme, the satellite was to be named after Puck from A Midsummer Night's Dream.|$|E

25|$|The Space Shuttle generates 180dB {{of noise}} around its base. To combat this, NASA {{developed}} a sound suppression system which can flow water at rates up to 900,000 gallons per minute (57m3/s) onto <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> <b>pad.</b> The water reduces {{the noise level}} from 180dB down to 142dB (the design requirement is 145dB). Without the sound suppression system, acoustic waves reflect off of <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> <b>pad</b> towards the rocket, vibrating the sensitive payload and crew. These acoustic waves can be so severe that they can destroy the rocket.|$|E
