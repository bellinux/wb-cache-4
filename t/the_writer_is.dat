It is revealed that <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> <b>is</b> his enemy, Sideshow Bob, who is incarcerated in Springfield State Prison. The next day, Sideshow Bob's parole hearing is held; {{the parole board}} is easily convinced that Sideshow Bob {{is no longer a}} threat. When the Simpson family goes to the cinema, Sideshow Bob sits {{in front of them and}} acts obnoxiously. The Simpsons then realize that it was he who sent the letters, and Marge angrily tells him to stay away from Bart.|$|E
5|$|The Hugo Award for Best Fan Writer is the Hugo Award given {{each year}} for writers of works related to science fiction or fantasy which {{appeared}} in low- or non-paying publications such as semiprozines or fanzines or in generally available electronic media during the previous calendar year. There is no restriction that <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> <b>is</b> not also a professional author, and several such authors have won the award for their non-paying works. The award was first presented in 1967 and has been awarded annually.|$|E
5|$|The cursive {{style has}} many unorthodox {{characteristics}} uncommon to Western writing systems. Vowels can be dropped if <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> <b>is</b> {{in a hurry}} and feels the word is obvious as in an abjad, letters can be written above or below the base line depending on what precedes them, and êêÆ is placed on letters after they are already written as in an abugida. Furthermore, unlike the typeset alphabet, the cursive alphabet has no letter case. These characteristics could have arisen because Watt was a local expert in Pitman shorthand, which is written in a similar way.|$|E

25|$|A new {{variant of}} the World Era was {{suggested}} in the Chronicon Paschale, a valuable Byzantine universal chronicle of the world, composed about the year 630 AD by some representative of the Antiochian scholarly tradition. It had for its basis a chronological list of events extending from the creation of Adam to the year AD 627. The chronology of <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> <b>is</b> based on the figures of the Bible and begins with 21 March, 5507.|$|E
25|$|The name {{under which}} <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> <b>is</b> universally known did not {{actually}} originate from his own wishes, but was selected and imposed on the public by Arghezi, only one year before Urmuz committed suicide. The spelling Hurmuz, when used {{in reference to the}} writer, was popular in the 1920s, but has since been described as erroneous. The variant Ormuz, sometimes rendered as Urmuz, was also used as a pen name by the activist and novelist A. L. Zissu.|$|E
25|$|However, the Unicode hyphen is {{awkward to}} enter on most keyboards, so the hyphen-minus {{character}} remains very common. They {{are often used}} instead of dashes or minus signs in situations where the preferred characters are unavailable (such as ASCII-only text), where the preferred characters take effort to enter (via dialog boxes or multi-key, unmemorable keyboard shortcuts), or when <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> <b>is</b> unaware of the distinction. Some writers use two hyphen-minuses (--) to represent a dash in ASCII text.|$|E

25|$|Sonnet 32 {{is one of}} 154 sonnets {{written by}} the English playwright and poet William Shakespeare. It {{is a member of}} the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. <b>The</b> <b>writer</b> <b>is</b> {{reflecting}} on a future in which the young man will probably outlive him. The writer takes a melancholy tone, telling the young man to remember the writer not because of the strength of the sonnets, but because the love that has been shown to the young man far surpasses any love shown by another poet.|$|E
25|$|In Paris {{there is}} a full length marble statue by Pierre Julien, now in the Louvre, that was {{commissioned}} in 1781 and exhibited at the 1785 Salon. <b>The</b> <b>writer</b> <b>is</b> represented in an ample cloak, sitting in contemplation on a gnarled tree on which a vine with grapes is climbing. On his knee is the manuscript of the fable of the fox and the grapes, while at his feet a fox is seated on his hat with its paw on a leather-bound volume, looking up at him. Small scale porcelain models were made of this by the S√®vres pottery and in polychrome porcelain by the Frankenthal pottery. In the following century small models were made of the bronze statue by Etienne Marin Melingue, exhibited in Paris in 1840 and in London in 1881. In this the poet is leaning thoughtfully against a rock, hat in hand. Also in the Cour Napol√©on of the Louvre is the 1857 standing stone statue by Jean-Louis Jaley.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these and many more names, we must mention the numerous religious who seek in the archives fresh material for general ecclesiastical history, or {{the history of their}} order, e. g. the Benedictines and the Bollandists. The writer has observed at work in the archives during the last twenty-one years Dominicans, Jesuits, Franciscans, Minor Conventuals, Capuchins, Trinitarians, Cistercians, Benedictines, Basilians, Christian Brothers, Lateran Canons Regular, Vallombrosans, Camaldolese, Olivetans, Silvestrines, Carthusians, Augustinians, Mercedarians, Barnabites, and others. Women have at times secured temporary admittance, though for intelligible reasons this privilege is now restricted. Since 1879 the archives have welcomed Catholics, Protestants, Hebrews, believers and infidels, Christians and heathens, priests and laymen, men and women, rich and poor, persons of high social standing and plain citizens, of every nation and language. <b>The</b> <b>writer</b> <b>is</b> acquainted with nearly all the great archives of Europe, and knows that none of them afford similar facilities to the historical student or extend him more courtesy. The number of visitors is at all times higher than to other archives, while the freedom allowed {{in the use of the}} material is the most far-reaching known; practically nothing is kept hidden.|$|E

25|$|The {{rhetoric and}} {{composition}} pedagogy {{developed in the}} late nineteenth century, and still used in many schools today, is known as current-traditional rhetoric, commonly referred to among field scholars, and hereinafter, as ‚ÄúCTR.‚Äù CTR is defined by an emphasis on the final product, usually the five-paragraph, informal essay or short research paper on an objective topic. In addition, CTR centers around the notion that discourse is delivered in a prescribed, mechanical form, leading to its pedagogical focus on grammar, spelling, syntax, and uniform style and arrangement. Further, CTR promotes the idea that the purpose of writing is the product, which is expected to reflect a predefined, stagnant reality without consideration for process, authorial identity, or audience. For example, a CTR pedagogue might instruct his or her students to write an essay on bicycles; the expected outcome is an objective discussion of bicycles organized in a five-paragraph essay, the identity of the audience or <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> <b>is</b> not to be considered, and the goal is the final product‚Äîthe ‚Äúessay‚Äù‚Äî which should have no errors (or even intentional boundary-breakers) in grammar, spelling, or design. James Berlin and Robert Inkster examine typical CTR textbooks and evaluate their limited approach to teaching composition, concluding that CTR limits ‚Äúdiscovery procedures,‚Äù diminishes the ‚Äúimportance of the writer,‚Äù and restricts writer engagement with audience. Likewise, W. Ross Winterowd similarly contends that the pedagogy of CTR is dated and ultimately ineffective in his examination of a number of current-traditional textbooks.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway is [...] "most {{definitely}} on vacation" [...] in True at First Light writes Fleming; and Burwell sees {{an author}} who is willingly and happily enjoying a vacation, behaving [...] childishly, blissfully {{unaware of the}} effect his behavior has on the members of camp. The impression is of a man seeking to delve into cultural conflicts in Africa, which takes a fictional turn in the Debba storyline. Mary is characterized as a nag whereas the character of <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> <b>is</b> presented as [...] "placid, mature, and loving", immersing himself in native culture.|$|E
500|$|Stine's {{books have}} a {{reputation}} for getting children excited about reading, which <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> <b>is</b> very proud of. James Carter, writing in Talking Books: Children's Authors Talk About the Craft, Creativity and Process of Writing, stated [...] "regarding Point Horrors and Goosebumps, I feel that anything that children read avidly is a good thing". Librarian and writer Patrick Jones commented that [...] "he real horror is a culture where kids, especially boys, don't read‚Äîand Stine has done his best to stop that turn of the screw from happening in his lifetime".|$|E

50|$|The {{film was}} written by Olde English Comedy members Raphael Bob-Waksberg, Dave Segal, and Adam Conover‚Äîas well as former member Joel Clark and OE {{collaborator}} Chioke Nassor. The order of <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>was</b> chosen randomly, and each <b>writer</b> <b>was</b> given a week to write their 15-page section.

500|$|Certain {{elements}} in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> <b>is</b> unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, {{the camera pans}} away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a [...] "postmodern update" [...] of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest (1959).|$|E
500|$|... "The Roof" [...] was {{acclaimed}} {{by contemporary}} music critics for its choice of vocal work, instrumentation and lyrics. David Browne from Entertainment Weekly praised the song {{as well as}} Carey's choice of vocals, writing [...] "Carey is still a vocal grandstander capable of turning all into a six-syllable word. Yet {{for most of the}} album she keeps her notorious octave-climbing chops at bay. Showing some admirable restraint, she nestles herself into the downy-soft beats of 'The Roof'." [...] Rich Juzwiak from Slant wrote [...] "Little more than yearning, kissing, and remembering happens during the course of 'The Roof,' a rough-enough R revision of Mobb Deep's 'The Shook Ones.' But lyrically Mariah <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> <b>is</b> vivid, sometimes shockingly clever (rhyming 'liberated' with 'Moet' is a stroke of genius)." ...|$|E
500|$|Playwright Horton Foote {{reportedly}} considered {{giving up}} on film writing, due to what he regarded as a poor adaption of his 1952 play The Chase into a 1966 film of the same name. Following what Foote saw as a far more successful adaption of his 1968 play Tomorrow in 1972, his interest in filmmaking was rekindled, {{under the condition that}} he maintain some degree of control over the final product. Foote said of this stage in his career, [...] "I learned that film really should be like theatre in the sense that in theatre, <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> <b>is,</b> of course, very dominant... If we don't like something, we can speak our minds.... It is always a collaborative effort.... But in Hollywood it wasn't so. A writer there has in his contract that you are a writer for hire, which means that you write a script, then it belongs to them." [...] This renewed interest in cinema prompted Foote to write Tender Mercies, his first work written specifically for the screen. In the view of biographer George Terry Barr, the script reflected [...] "Foote's determination to battle a Hollywood system that generally refuses to make such personal films." ...|$|E

2500|$|Also in 1971, Andrew D. Weiner {{argued that}} the play's actual theme is unity. The poet's {{imagination}} creates unity by giving form to diverse elements, and <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> <b>is</b> addressing the spectator's own imagination which also creates and perceives unity. Weiner connected this unity {{to the concept of}} uniformity, and in turn viewed this as Shakespeare's allusion to the [...] "eternal truths" [...] of Platonism and Christianity.|$|E
