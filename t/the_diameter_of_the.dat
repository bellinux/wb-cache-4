5|$|The account {{published}} in Journal des sçavans {{was based on}} a report that Rømer read to the French Academy of Sciences in November 1676 (Cohen, 1940, p.346). When measured from Earth, the periods of moons orbiting a distant planet are shorter when the Earth is approaching the planet than when the Earth is receding from it. The distance travelled by light from the planet (or its moon) to Earth is shorter when the Earth is at the point in its orbit that is closest to its planet than when the Earth is at the farthest point in its orbit, the difference in distance being <b>the</b> <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth's orbit around the Sun. The observed change in the moon's orbital period is caused by the difference {{in the time it takes}} light to traverse the shorter or longer distance. Rømer observed this effect for Jupiter's innermost moon Io and deduced that light takes 22 minutes to cross <b>the</b> <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth's orbit.|$|E

5|$|The size of {{the welding}} torch nozzle depends {{on the amount of}} {{shielded}} area desired. The {{size of the}} gas nozzle depends upon <b>the</b> <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electrode, the joint configuration, and the availability of access to the joint by the welder. The inside diameter of the nozzle is preferably at least three times <b>the</b> <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electrode, but there are no hard rules. The welder judges the effectiveness of the shielding and increases the nozzle size to increase the area protected by the external gas shield as needed. The nozzle must be heat resistant and thus is normally made of alumina or a ceramic material, but fused quartz, a high purity glass, offers greater visibility. Devices can be inserted into the nozzle for special applications, such as gas lenses or valves to improve the control shielding gas flow to reduce turbulence and introduction of contaminated atmosphere into the shielded area. Hand switches to control welding current can be added to the manual GTAW torches.|$|E
