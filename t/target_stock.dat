50|$|In a cash merger, the {{acquirer}} {{offers to}} purchase the shares of the target for a certain price in cash. The <b>target’s</b> <b>stock</b> price will most likely increase when the acquirer makes the offer, but the stock price will remain below the offer value. In some cases, the <b>target's</b> <b>stock</b> price will increase to a level above the offer price. This would indicate that investors expect that a higher bid could be coming for the target, either from the acquirer or from a third party. To initiate a position, the arbitrageur will buy the <b>target's</b> <b>stock.</b> The arbitrageur makes a profit when the <b>target's</b> <b>stock</b> price approaches the offer price, which will occur when the likelihood of deal consummation increases. The <b>target's</b> <b>stock</b> price will be equal to the offer price upon deal completion.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Several diversified firms have, {{in recent}} years, issued {{separate}} stock to track different industry segments (“targeted stock”or “tracking stock”). This paper analyzes market reactions to announcements of proposed <b>targeted</b> <b>stock</b> issuances and investigates possible motives for this choice of organizational structure. We find {{a statistically significant}} positive abnormal return of 3. 61 % within a three-day window around the announcement of proposed <b>targeted</b> <b>stock</b> issuances. This positive reaction may be attributable to the expectation of greater availability of information on each <b>targeted</b> <b>stock</b> segment, {{as well as the}} monitoring and motivational advantages of linking a stock directly with an industry segment. We find a lower incidence of tax loss carry-forwards among firms that have issued <b>targeted</b> <b>stock</b> compared to those that have spun off segments, suggesting that tax reasons may be partially responsible for the choice of this organizational structure. We also find that the stock returns and cash flows of <b>targeted</b> <b>stock</b> segments are influenced more by their common corporate affiliation than by industry factors, although industry influences are also strong...|$|R

We then compare and contrast <b>Targeted</b> <b>Stock</b> with alternative equity reorganization forms, including spin-offs, equity carve-outs, and dual class common stock. We argue that <b>Targeted</b> <b>Stock</b> is most useful for firms in which the benefits of integration and control over corporate operating and financing activities outweigh the benefits of a complete or partial separation of the targeted business unit(s). ...|$|R

5000|$|In a stock merger, the {{acquirer}} {{offers to}} purchase the target by exchanging its own <b>stock</b> for the <b>target's</b> <b>stock</b> at a specified ratio. To initiate a position, the arbitrageur will buy the <b>target's</b> <b>stock</b> and short sell the acquirer's stock. This process is called [...] "setting a spread". The size of the spread positively correlates to the perceived risk that the deal will not be consummated at its original terms. The arbitrageur makes a profit when the spread narrows, which occurs when deal consummation appears more likely. Upon deal completion, the <b>target's</b> <b>stock</b> will be converted into stock of the acquirer based on the exchange ratio determined by the merger agreement. At this point in time, the spread will close. The arbitrageur delivers the converted stock into his short position to close his position.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the prevalence of}} insider trading in the corporate debt market prior to takeover announcements, and the related conflicts of interest within financial intermediaries. We document significant pre-announcement trading activities and price movements in target bonds, in directions consistent {{with the nature of}} pending information. Unlike <b>target</b> <b>stocks,</b> <b>target</b> bonds do not always gain in an acquisition. Target bonds rated higher than the acquirer’s stand to lose whereas those rated lower stand to gain. Since selling (buying) target bonds that stand to lose (gain) prior to the public announcement requires information about acquirer characteristics, our evidence cannot be attributed to market anticipation, but is consistent with insider trading. Further, bond dealers affiliated with advisory investment banks sell in anticipation of negative news on bonds, pointing to a possible channel of information leakage. Such negative news seems to be incorporated into bond prices no slower than into the <b>target</b> <b>stocks.</b> Finally, recent improvements in bond market transparency appear to deter insider trading in bonds...|$|R
5000|$|A new {{category}} of deferred annuity, called the fixed indexed annuity (FIA) emerged in 1995 (originally called an Equity-Indexed Annuity). Fixed indexed annuities may have features of both fixed and variable deferred annuities. The insurance company typically guarantees a minimum return for EIA. An investor can still lose money {{if he or}} she cancels (or surrenders) the policy early, before a [...] "break even" [...] period. An oversimplified expression of a typical EIA's rate of return might be that it is equal to a stated [...] "participation rate" [...] multiplied by a <b>target</b> <b>stock</b> market index's performance excluding dividends. Interest rate caps or an administrative fee may be applicable.|$|E
50|$|The PSG1A1 variant was {{introduced}} by Heckler & Koch in 2006, and features two major improvements. First, the cocking handle was relocated a couple of degrees counter-clockwise. This {{was due to the}} fact that when locked rearward, it could physically interfere with the long scopes often used on the rifles. The second modification involved the replacement of the outdated Hensoldt scope. Non-police users often found the scope's 600 m range limitation and simple crosshairs inadequate for their needs. In addition, the rechargeable batteries are difficult to recharge and to find replacements. A final fault is that Hensoldt does not service the scope in the United States. For these reasons, the PSG1A1 has been outfitted with a Schmidt & Bender 3-12×50 Police Marksman II scope, mounted on 34 mm rings. One last modification involved converting the SG 550 Sniper stock to work with the PSG1. The H&K rifle now has a completely side-folding adjustable <b>target</b> <b>stock</b> removing a solid 10 in in overall length. To remedy brass ejection a brass catcher must be installed.|$|E
50|$|Under {{the three}} {{principles}} are {{a total of}} 31 performance indicators that a fishery is scored against by an independent team of experts. The minimum passing score {{for each of the}} 31 performance indicators is set at a level which gives a good level of assurance that the productivity of all key elements of the ecosystem on which the fishery has an impact are not compromised. The MSC system therefore not only takes into account the impact of the fishery on the <b>target</b> <b>stock,</b> but also other vital components of the wider ecosystem, such as habitat structure, productivity and biodiversity. This minimum level equates to a score of 60 and if the fishery scores below 60 on any one of the 31 Performance Indicators it is an automatic failure. However, achieving only the minimum, 60 performance level is not adequate to become certified against the MSC standard; average scores of at least 80 for the Performance Indicators under each of the three principles have to be achieved. As a result, every fishery certified against the MSC standard is operating at a very high level of precaution. This means the fishery is more resilient to potential changes such as natural stock fluctuations, and better able to secure its long-term sustainability.|$|E

50|$|The {{arbitrageur}} {{can generate}} returns either actively or passively. Active arbitrageurs purchase enough {{stock in the}} target to control {{the outcome of the}} merger. These activist investors initiate sales processes or hold back support from ongoing mergers in attempts to solicit a higher bid. On {{the other end of the}} spectrum, passive arbitrageurs do not influence the outcome of the merger. One set of passive arbitrageurs invests in deals that the market expects to succeed and increases holdings if the probability of success improves. The other set of passive arbitrageurs is more involved, but passive nonetheless: these arbitrageurs are more selective with their investments, meticulously testing assumptions on the risk-reward profile of individual deals. This set of arbitrageurs will invest in deals in which they conclude that the probability of success is greater than what the spread implies. Passive arbitrageurs have more freedom in very liquid stocks: the more liquid the <b>target</b> <b>stock,</b> the better risk arbitrageurs can hide their trade. In this case, using the assumption that a higher arbitrageur presence increases the probability of consummation, the share price will not fully reflect the increased probability of success and the risk arbitrageur can buy shares and make a profit. The arbitrageur must decide whether an active role or a passive role in the merger is the more attractive option in a given situation.|$|E
5000|$|In February 1918 {{the company}} {{assigned}} designers Thomas Crosley Johnson and Frank Burton {{to begin work}} on the new match rifle. Johnson had more experience with bolt actions than most at Winchester (which was then primarily a maker of lever- and pump-action firearms), having superintended production of the P-14/M1917 Enfield, as well as having designed a series of prototype military rifles known as Models A through D. [...] Johnson quickly obtained approval for a receiver based closely on that of the Model D, together with a barrel adapted from the [...]22 target version of the Model 1885. The stock from the receiver back was modeled on that of the Model D, which in turn had been derived from the Model 1895 Winchester-Lee; but incorporated a forearm based on a custom Single Shot <b>target</b> <b>stock</b> designed in 1908 by Winchester's house marksman, Capt. Albert F. Laudensack.With the externals settled, Johnson and Burton turned to developing the action for what was now [...] "Experimental Design No. 111." [...] Each built a prototype of his own design in Winchester's Model Shop, both at this stage still single-shot. In the fall of 1918 the project's requirements were changed to include a detachable 5-round box magazine: neither Johnson's nor Burton's original bolts would work with a magazine feed, but a combination incorporating elements of both proved highly satisfactory. A finalized repeater prototype was made in April 1919 and taken to Washington where it was evaluated by Lt. Col. Townsend Whelen of the General Staff, Director of Civilian Marksmanship Maj. Richard LaGarde, and Gen. Fred Phillips of the National Rifle Association, who were enthusiastic-—- although guarded about the prospects of a Government contract.|$|E
40|$|National Standard 1 {{states that}} a primary {{function}} of fisheries {{management in the}} single stock case is {{the determination of the}} annual allowable harvest, and {{it is based on the}} selection of a <b>target</b> <b>stock</b> size and a control rule that will specify a harvest path that that will cause the <b>target</b> <b>stock</b> size to be achieved or maintained. The selection of the <b>target</b> <b>stock</b> and the control rule are conceptually policy decisions. In principle, <b>target</b> <b>stock</b> and control rule are selected so as to maximize the benefits to current and future users. In summary, NS 1 guidelines are focused on the answer to two questions. Where do we want to go? (What is the <b>target</b> <b>stock</b> size?). How do we want to get there? (What is the control rule for determining the time path of harvests?) In an analogous manner, the basics of EBFM can be understood as a process of answering an analogous but expanded set of questions. It will be necessary to come with the EBFM equivalents or analogous concepts of the <b>target</b> <b>stock</b> size and the harvest control rule. But to complete the analogy it will also be necessary to answer the question of why do we want to go there. The legislative mandate to use Xmsy as the <b>target</b> <b>stock</b> in single species management has pushed that question aside. Given the non-comparability of the benefits from the use of the outputs of multiple stocks, it will be necessary to go beyond the concept of the maximization of sustainable biomass yield as a measure of benefits in order to design an EBFM system that will allow for the answer to the expanded set of question in an internally consistent manner. The presentation will describe a preliminary approach to the design of an EBFM program using the NS 1 paradigm giving special emphasis to required changes in the statute and the guidelines...|$|E

40|$|Much of {{the current}} {{literature}} on ecosystem based approaches to fisheries management focuses on the ecosystem impacts of fishing activities, and requirements to develop management plans that look beyond just <b>target</b> <b>stocks.</b> While this narrow interpretation is appropriate for fisheries with a limited diversity of stakeholder interests, particularly in isolated regions such as Antarctica, it requires a far more holistic approach in multispecies or multi-gear fisheries which feature a diverse range of socio-economic interests from both developed and developing states requiring a far more holistic approach. In such cases, for example the Pacific island tuna fisheries, {{it is important to}} consider management priorities-both in terms of <b>target</b> <b>stocks</b> and their broader ecosystem-and the varying distribution of the conservation burden and benefits among communities in developed and developing states.

Professor Easterbrook and Mr. Jarrell think {{the evidence is}} unequivocal They cite three recent studies of post-offer movements in the prices of <b>target</b> <b>stocks</b> which show that successful defensive tactics by management have deprived target shareholders of appreciation gains worth between fifteen and fifty-two percent {{of the value of}} targets hares. They then introduce the results of their own more conventional study: had these gains been realized and reinvested in equity securities, shareholders would have fared considerably better during the past decade. The authors argue that a similar study by Kidder, Peabody 2 ̆ 6 Co. reaches a seemingly contrary result because it erroneously compares the post-offer performances of these <b>target</b> <b>stocks</b> to the rate of inflation rather than to the performance of the equity market.
