While the professionals in the industry state that <b>the</b> <b>contractors</b> are inefficient, <b>the</b> <b>contractors</b> claim that they have many problems and obstacles to perform efficiently (Perera; 1991). This situation emphasizes that it is an imperative necessity to identify and establish the difficulties faced by <b>the</b> <b>contractors</b> in achieving excellence in the Sri Lankan Construction Industry. <b>The</b> <b>contractors</b> better results. This research was undertaken to identify the most pressing problems faced by large scale <b>contractors.</b> <b>The</b> research work was done in four phases. Literature study, identfication of factors, identification of most pressing problems, and data analysis. The problems were categorized as long term problems and short term problems. They were then categorized as very important, important, less important and not important. The problems which received more than 80 % agreement from <b>the</b> <b>contractors</b> as very important priority were considered as the most pressing problems. The results shows that the most pressing short term problem is the payment delays. The most pressing long term problem is the instability of <b>the</b> <b>contractors</b> due to unrealistic bidding behaviors and insufficient concern for future planning with inconsistent policies...|$|R

5|$|The {{opening of}} the Green Line was {{significantly}} delayed, however, when in May 1990 WMATA fired <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> building the Shaw–Howard University and U Street–Cardozo stations. Mergentime/Perini Joint Venture, <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> working on the stations, had violated its contract with WMATA by reducing the workforce on the project, not meeting project deadlines, and permitting unsafe working conditions to persist. Mergentime/Perini denied the accusations. Although similar problems plagued Mergentime/Perini's work on the Navy Yard station, WMATA did not fire the joint venture company from that project. WMATA said that the problems would delay the Green Line's opening until at least the late spring of 1991.|$|E

5|$|Renewed {{tension between}} Britain and France in the 1840s {{led to a}} {{modernisation}} of some of Britain's coastal defences. The batteries at Shornemead and Coalhouse Point were reinstated and upgraded, though the one at Lower Hope Point was never restored. In {{the case of the}} Coalhouse battery, it was substantially expanded between 1847 and 1855 to convert it into a fort. The work was slow as the marshy ground caused the foundations to crack and the structure to subside, and <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> was unsatisfactory.|$|E
5|$|Robert Mark Realty {{bought the}} former station in 1986 and renovated it {{at a cost}} of $175,000. Work began in October 1987 and was more than halfway done by January 1988. Matt Bialecki, the {{architect}} who had overseen the renovation of the former New Paltz opera house as a restaurant, served as the project's architect. Wilro Builders served as <b>the</b> <b>contractor.</b> The building's design follows a Shingle Style architecture and its sidings are both shingle and clapboard. There are bay windows on the east and west faces, and rafters are partly visible. The building served as a real estate office.|$|E

5|$|The nave was in poorest {{condition}} and the walls were substantially rebuilt and the porch wholly replaced {{in the first phase}} in 1868-9, with Thomas Williams of Cardiff <b>the</b> <b>contractor.</b> The font was restored at this time. Traces of painted decoration were found in the nave, including a colossal St Christopher on the north wall opposite the entrance. Unfortunately this and other traces of fresco could not be saved; they were destroyed without a pictorial record of them having been made. The committee considered an oak roof for the nave, but rejected it as too costly.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} {{approved}} in 1934, {{under the supervision}} of CORF (Commission d'Organisation des Régions Fortifiées), the Maginot Line's design and construction agency. Work by <b>the</b> <b>contractor</b> Chanel of Antibes began in 1935 at a cost of 14.5 million francs. A second phase was planned to add an artillery block. This was scaled back to a pair of separate artillery casemates. A separate entrance block was proposed in April 1940, linking to the casemates. As the initial confrontation with Germany was already underway, {{it was too late to}} be built, with a projected construction time of 18 months.|$|E
