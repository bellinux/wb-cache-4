5|$|Donen's {{next film}} was Kiss <b>Them</b> <b>for</b> <b>Me.</b> He was {{personally}} asked by Cary Grant to direct and began developing it while still under contract at MGM. With a plot that strongly resembles On the Town, the film features Grant, Ray Walston and Larry Blyden as three navy officers on leave in San Francisco in 1944. Unlike On the Town, Kiss <b>Them</b> <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> {{is a dark}} comedy that contrasts the officers' selfless heroism with their self-absorbed hedonism while on leave. The film was released in 1957 to mostly poor reviews.|$|E
500|$|Mansfield's fourth {{starring}} role in a Hollywood film was in Kiss <b>Them</b> <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> (1957), for which she received prominent billing alongside Cary Grant. However, in the film itself she {{is little more than}} comic relief; Grant's character prefers a sleek, demure redhead played by fashion model Suzy Parker. Kiss <b>Them</b> <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> was described as [...] "vapid" [...] and [...] "ill-advised", and was a critical and box office flop. The film was Mansfield's final {{starring role}} in a mainstream Hollywood studio film. It also marked one of the last attempts by 20th Century-Fox to publicize her.|$|E
500|$|The {{alternative}} {{rock band}} Siouxsie and the Banshees picked {{the title of}} Billboard Top 100 hit single [...] "Kiss Them for Me" [...] (included in their 1991's album Superstition) from Mansfield's 1957 film Kiss <b>Them</b> <b>for</b> <b>Me.</b> Lyrics of the song uses Mansfield's catchword [...] "divoon", and refers to her heart-shaped swimming pool, her love of champagne and parties, and to the grisly automobile accident which claimed her life in 1967. In Grok, a novel by Tom Maremaa, a character plays the CD and asks, [...] "Yes, kiss <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> [...] I may be delayed." [...] Too Hot To Handle, the UFO song considered {{to one of the}} top 500 heavy metal songs, takes its title from a Jayne Mansfield film. Mansfield is also alluded in the song [...] "The Actor" [...] by Robbie Williams, from the album [...] "Rudebox". Alternative rock band The Chills released [...] "16 Heartthrobs" [...] as a memorial to Mansfield. In 1997, Courtney Love of the alternative rock band Hole used a photo of Mansfield's wrecked car in the album artwork for the group's compilation album, My Body, the Hand Grenade.|$|E

500|$|Otto and Edith Frank {{planned to}} go into hiding with the {{children}} on 16 July 1942, but when Margot received a call-up notice from the Zentralstelle für jüdische Auswanderung (Central Office for Jewish Emigration) on 5 July, ordering her to report for relocation to a work camp, {{they were forced to}} move the plan ten days forward. Shortly before going into hiding, Anne gave her friend and neighbour, Toosje Kupers, a book, a tea set, a tin of marbles, and the family cat for safekeeping. As the Associated Press reports: [...] "'I'm worried about my marbles, because I'm scared they might fall into the wrong hands,' Kupers said Anne told her.

500|$|After three {{films in}} 1957 Donen became an {{independent}} producer and director. He had reluctantly agreed to direct Kiss <b>Them</b> <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> {{on condition that}} 20th Century Fox buy out his remaining contract with MGM. Now free from contractual obligations, he formed Grandon Productions with Grant and signed a distribution deal through Warner Brothers. Donen would self-produce nearly all of his films {{for the rest of}} his career, sometimes under the name [...] "Stanley Donen Productions". Donen and Grant inaugurated their company in 1958 with Indiscreet, based on a play by Norman Krasna and starring Grant and Ingrid Bergman. Because of Bergman's schedule, the film was shot on location in London where, much like he had in his directorial debut, Donen utilized such landmarks as the Leicester Galleries, the Royal Opera House and the Garrick Club. Bergman plays a famous and reclusive actress who falls in love with the playboy-diplomat Grant, who tells her that he is already married and that his wife refuses to divorce him. When Bergman discovers that he has been lying about having a wife, she concocts a charade with another man in order to win Grant's full affection. The film's most famous scene involves Donen's clever circumvention of the strict Production Code. In the scene, Grant is in Paris while Bergman is still in London and the two exchange pillow talk over the phone. Donen used a split screen of the two stars with synchronized movements to make it appear as though they were in the same bed together. The film was a financial and critical success, and Donen was compared to such directors as Ernst Lubitsch and George Cukor.|$|E

2500|$|Spencer Tracy was {{originally}} cast in April 1957 as Joseph Chapin. Because of Tracy's repeated teaming with Katharine Hepburn, the film's producer Charles Brackett {{announced he was}} enthusiastic about casting Hepburn as his wife. In May 1957, model-actress Suzy Parker told the press in an interview: [...] "If I'm good in Kiss <b>Them</b> <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> with Cary Grant, Buddy Adler {{is going to give}} me a very good role in 10 North Frederick with Spencer Tracy. Parker was eventually cast, which, according to insiders, did not satisfy Tracy, who left the production in November 1957. Tracy dismissed these rumours, saying: ...|$|E

Regarding this event, Nas later recalled [...] "Rae would come out to Queensbridge, I would go to Staten Island. We'd just ride and hang out all night. We didn't call each other to work. We called each other to hang out. Somehow we wound up in the studio. RZA had a couple of beats. He played <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I got on both of them. The other one never came out.

The resulting article noted:"At Oakland, Boros used computers extensively, studying percentages and tendencies to guide his strategic decisions, but at heart, he is a humanist. He would rather read a good baseball novel than a complex statistical analysis of the game. 'I found that players are very suspicious of computers, much like the general public,' he said. 'They fear them as cold and impersonal and inhuman. I couldn't make them understand that I was still going to make my own decisions, I wasn't going to let the computer make <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I'm going to use some data and stats here, but we won't have a computer and a programmer in the clubhouse like we did in Oakland." ...|$|E
