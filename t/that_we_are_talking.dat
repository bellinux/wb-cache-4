25|$|The {{constellation}} Virgo is {{a specific}} constellation of stars in the sky, hence the process of forming Virgo cannot be an operational definition, since it is historical and not repeatable. Nevertheless, the process whereby we locate Virgo in the sky is repeatable, so in this way, Virgo is operationally defined. In fact, Virgo can have any number of definitions (although we can never prove <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about the same Virgo), and any number may be operational.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{spirituality and}} its {{relationship}} with science, Sagan stated: 'Spirit' comes from the Latin word 'to breathe'. What we breathe is air, which is certainly matter, however thin. Despite usage to the contrary, there is no necessary implication in the word 'spiritual' <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> of anything other than matter (including the matter of which the brain is made), or anything ...|$|E

With tears in my eyes and on my knees I beg you that when you have a national or two to spend, go straight to Mendesky's, or any other library- and ask for a copy of [...] "Looking the life" [...] of this author. I think that it was published in Montevideo. Is a great book, and reading it soothed me from the foolishness of Giusti, Soiza, O'Reilly and my cousin Alvarito Melián Lafinur.|$|E

2500|$|A simpler {{statement}} of the theorem uses graph theory. The set of regions of a map can be represented more abstractly as an undirected graph that has a vertex for each region and an edge for every pair of regions that share a boundary segment. This graph is planar (it {{is important to note}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about the graphs that have some limitations according to the map they are transformed from only): it can be drawn in the plane without crossings by placing each vertex at an arbitrarily chosen location within the region to which it corresponds, and by drawing the edges as curves that lead without crossing within each region from the vertex location to each shared boundary point of the region. Conversely any planar graph can be formed from a map in this way. In graph-theoretic terminology, the four-color theorem states that the vertices of every planar graph can be colored with at most four colors so that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color, or for short, [...] "every planar graph is four-colorable" [...] ( [...] ; [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|In June 2016 it was {{reported}} that to meet Package 1 of the Multi Role Vehicle-Protected (MRV-P) requirement, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) was in talks with the Pentagon on acquiring the JLTV via the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) route. “We can confirm <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> to the US DOD regarding Package 1 , to inform our understanding of an FMS option for the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle,” said an MoD spokesman. [...] It was stated in January 2017 by Maj. Gen. Robert Talbot Rice, the director of land equipment at the Defence Equipment and Support arm of the Ministry of Defence (MoD), that: [...] "We are working through the Foreign Military Sales process. A letter of request has been sent to our American colleagues, and we expect a response in the next few months." [...] Talbot Rice told an audience of industry executives and military personnel at the International Armoured Vehicles conference in London on 24 January that the Army had opted for the single-source purchase due to its ability to meet UK requirements and its value for money.|$|E

Now, therefore, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> {{only about}} {{grafting}} and growing, pray do not vex yourselves with thinking {{what you are}} {{to do with the}} pippins. It may be desirable for us to have much art, or little--we will examine that by-and-bye; but just now, let us keep to the simple consideration how to get plenty of good art if we want it. Perhaps it might be just as well that a man of moderate income should be able to possess a good picture, as that any work of real merit should cost 500l. or 1,000l.; at all events, it is certainly one of the branches of political economy to ascertain how, if we like, we can get things in quantities--plenty of corn, plenty of wine, plenty of gold, or plenty of pictures.|$|E

And as both these persons have passed entirely out of existence, I think you and I need consider them no longer. And we can talk about tennis or bass fishing, or anything we like. And if you are a fisherman you will be glad to hear that there is first-rate bass fishing in the river now, and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> of getting up a regular fishing party.

The {{ground is}} removed; for a {{grounded}} fear of damnation is this--I am yet in my sins, {{in a state}} of nature, under the law, without faith, and so under the wrath of God. This, I say, is the ground of the fear of damnation, the true ground to fear it; but now the man <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> of, is one that hath the ground of this fear taken away by the testimony and seal of the spirit of adoption. He is called, justified, and has, for the truth of this his condition, received the evidence of the spirit of adoption, and hath been thereby enabled to call God [...] "Father, Father." [...] Now he that hath received this, has the ground of the fear of damnation taken from him; therefore his fear, I say, being without ground, is false, and so no work of the Spirit of God.|$|E

60|$|What is it {{but this}} power of speech, of {{recording}} experience, which enables {{men to be}} men--looking before and after and, in some dim sense, understanding the working of this wondrous universe--and which distinguishes man from {{the whole of the}} brute world? I say that this functional difference is vast, unfathomable, and truly infinite in its consequences; and I say at the same time, that it may depend upon structural differences which shall be absolutely inappreciable to us with our present means of investigation. What is this very speech <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about? I am speaking to you at this moment, but if you were to alter, in the minutest degree, the proportion of the nervous forces now active in the two nerves which supply the muscles of my glottis, I should become suddenly dumb. The voice is produced only so long as the vocal chords are parallel; and these are parallel only so long as certain muscles contract with exact equality; and that again depends on the equality of action of those two nerves I spoke of. So that a change of the minutest kind in the structure of one of these nerves, or {{in the structure of the}} part in which it originates, or of the supply of blood to that part, or of one of the muscles to which it is distributed, might render all of us dumb. But a race of dumb men, deprived of all communication with those who could speak, would be little indeed removed from the brutes. And the moral and intellectual difference between them and ourselves would be practically infinite, though the naturalist should not be able to find a single shadow of even specific structural difference.|$|E
6000|$|An {{objection}} may {{be anticipated}} here, {{but it is}} very easily answered. It may be said that we do, in fact, call in medical specialists to settle whether a man is mad; and that these specialists go by technical and even secret tests that cannot be known to the mass of men. It is obvious that this is true; it is equally obvious that it does not affect our argument. When we ask the doctor whether our grandfather is going mad, we still mean mad by our own common human definition. We mean, {{is he going to be}} a certain sort of person whom all men recognise when once he exists. That certain specialists can detect the approach of him, before he exists, does not alter the fact that it is of the practical and popular madman <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking,</b> and of him alone. The doctor merely sees a certain fact potentially in the future, while we, with less information, can only see it in the present; but his fact is our fact and everybody's fact, or we should not bother about it at all. Here is no question of the doctor bringing an entirely new sort of person under coercion, as in the Feeble-Minded Bill. The doctor can say, [...] "Tobacco is death to you," [...] because the dislike of death can be taken for granted, being a highly democratic institution; and it is the same with the dislike of the indubitable exception called madness. The doctor can say, [...] "Jones has that twitch in the nerves, and he may burn down the house." [...] But it is not the medical detail we fear, but the moral upshot. We should say, [...] "Let him twitch, as long as he doesn't burn down the house." [...] The doctor may say, [...] "He has that look in the eyes, and he may take the hatchet and brain you all." [...] But we do not object to the look in the eyes as such; we object to consequences which, once come, we should all call insane if there were no doctors in the world. We should say, [...] "Let him look how he likes; as long as he does not look for the hatchet." ...|$|E
