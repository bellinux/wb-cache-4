Texas musician Doug Sahm wrote a song entitled [...] "Louis Riel," [...] which appeared on the album S.D.Q. '98. In the song, Sahm likens the lore surrounding Riel to David Crockett's legend in his home state, spinning an abridged tale of Riel's life as a revolutionary: [...] "...but you gotta respect {{him for what he}} <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>right...</b> And all around Regina they talk about him still – why did they have to kill Louis Riel?" ...|$|E

2500|$|During the Australian Cricket tour of New Zealand in March 2010, Clarke {{left the}} tour {{to return to}} Sydney for [...] "personal reasons". In a late night press conference on 12 March 2010, Clarke's {{management}} confirmed he and then-fiancée, model Lara Bingle (now Worthington), had decided to terminate their engagement. Speaking to GQ Australia in November 2010, Clarke said of his decision to leave the tour of New Zealand, [...] "My decision that I made there, was what I <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> I respect playing for my country that much that I thought, if I’m going to let anybody down, I shouldn’t be here — there’s somebody else who could be {{doing a better job}} than me. Going home was the right decision at the time for me. I don’t regret that decision." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It was {{all very}} well, Mr. Dusante," [...] said Mrs. Aleshine, [...] "for you to try to carry out what you <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>right,</b> but we have our ideas as to what our duty is, and you have your ideas as to what your duty is, an' consciences is even." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{did what}} she <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>right,</b> so we must not blame her. I am going to make my New Year's calls today and, as my friends live down that way, I'll get the list of names from Mrs. G. and tell the poor ladies, with Miss Campbell's compliments, that their new home is ready. Shall I?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was very}} intolerant, wasn't I?" [...] {{he said after}} a pause. [...] "You <b>thought</b> so--you <b>were</b> <b>right.</b> You have <b>been</b> happier since you--left me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{a strange}} and an {{extraordinary}} thing--a very singular--a most odd thing! I <b>thought</b> all <b>was</b> <b>right,</b> knew no other; and there--the family are gone!" ...|$|R

6000|$|Miss Mary. I spoke hastily just then. I--I--thought--you see--I--(angrily and passionately) I mean this. I'm a stranger. I don't {{understand}} your Californian ways, and I don't want to. But I believe you've done what you <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>right,</b> {{according to a}} MAN'S idea of right; and--there's my hand. Take it, take it; for it's a novelty, Mr. Morton: it's the hand of an honest girl! ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{started at}} the thought, at a depth and meaning in her voice, turned his chair about to look at her, and {{discovered}} she was weeping and choking noiselessly. He stood up close to her, moving very slowly and silently, his eyes full of this new surmise, and now without word or gesture from her he knew his <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> [...] "My dear," [...] he whispered.|$|E
6000|$|... "He didn't fear God; {{he loved}} Him. Perhaps it was wrong; but somehow he couldn't {{believe in a}} God of wrath when he saw how good and {{beautiful}} the world was and how kind folks were to him. He {{felt as if the}} Lord was his father, for he had no other; and when he was lonesomest that <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> comfortable and helpful to him. Was it wrong?" [...] asked Nat of the child.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed he did. He {{said he did}} {{not believe}} she was half as much to blame as her father <b>was,</b> and I <b>thought</b> he <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> Didn't you?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then was Keawe more wroth than ever. With her, {{because he}} <b>thought</b> she <b>was</b> {{brooding}} {{over the case}} of the old man; and with himself, because he <b>thought</b> she <b>was</b> <b>right,</b> and <b>was</b> ashamed to be so happy.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> he <b>was</b> <b>right</b> behind me," [...] {{came from}} Ben. He looked greatly distressed. [...] "I wonder if {{anything}} happened to him? Maybe he {{slipped off the}} rocks into the river!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mr. Le Breton,' she said, {{coming over}} towards {{the table where}} Ernest had just laid out his blotting-book and writing-paper: 'I couldn't prevent myself from coming up {{to tell you how}} much I admire your conduct in {{standing}} up so against papa for what you <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> and proper. I can't say how greatly I admire it. I'm so glad you did as you did do. You have acted nobly.' And Hilda looked straight into his eyes with the most speaking and most melting of glances. 'Now,' she said to herself, 'according to all correct precedents, he ought to seize my hand fervently with a gentle pressure, and thank me with tears in his eyes for my kind sympathy.' ...|$|E
60|$|It is a fact, as Shakespeare has so tersely hinted, that fame {{sometimes}} {{comes in}} the line of duty. To be sure, if Austen Vane had been Timothy Smith, the Mender case might not have made quite so many ripples in the pond with which this story is concerned. Austen did what he <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> In the opinion of many of his father's friends whom he met from time to time he had made a good-sized stride towards ruin, and they did not hesitate to tell him so--Mr. Chipman, president of the Ripton National Bank; Mr. Greene, secretary and treasurer of the Hawkeye Paper Company, who suggested with all kindness that, however noble it may be, it doesn't pay to tilt at windmills.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it's {{not that}} they called me a fool and a coward--I could have borne that. I did what I <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> I thought it my duty to {{save the lives of}} my men and to spare the enemy; and the result was that ten times more lives have been lost than if I had struck boldly and mercilessly. There are widows and orphans in England who must curse me because I am the cause that their husbands are dead, and that their fathers are rotting on the hills of India. If I had acted like a savage, like a brute-beast, like a butcher, all those men would have been alive to-day. I was merciful, and I was met with treachery; I was long-suffering, and they thought me weak; I was forgiving, and they laughed at me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> it <b>was</b> <b>right</b> {{they should}} meet," [...] {{explained}} the son, [...] "and so did father. I {{was glad that}} I suggested it, afterward; it was extremely gratifying to Colonel Lapham." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] {{said the}} elder woman; [...] "I <b>thought</b> I <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> Then {{you had a}} husband and no child. It now looks {{as if you had}} a child and no husband." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Be quiet," [...] I whispered back, [...] "and stop nosing {{at those}} planks." [...] But to myself I <b>thought,</b> Hans <b>is</b> <b>right,</b> we <b>are</b> in {{a nest of}} slave-traders, and this Hassan is their leader.|$|R
6000|$|... "We always honour {{women over}} there. Perhaps {{it is that}} we have so few. Over in these old {{countries}} you have not learned {{what it is to be}} without them. I have been away up the lakes for furs, living for months on end the life of a savage among the wigwams of the Sacs and the Foxes, foul livers and foul talkers, ever squatting like toads around their fires. Then when I have come back to Albany where my folk then dwelt, and have heard my sisters play upon the spinet and sing, and my mother talk to us of the France of her younger days and of her childhood, and of all that they had suffered for what they <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>right,</b> then I have felt what a good woman is, and how, like the sunshine, she draws out of one's soul all that is purest and best." ...|$|E
60|$|Puritanism did {{not mean}} nonconformity in her days, and in fact {{everyone}} who was earnest and scrupulous was apt to be termed a Puritan. Goodwife Kenton {{was one of those}} pious and simple souls who drink in whatever is good in their surroundings; and though the chaplain who had taught her in her youth would have differed in controversy with Mr. Holworth, she never discovered their diversity, nor saw more than that Elmwood Church had more decoration than the Castle Chapel. Whatever was done by authority she <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>right,</b> and she found good reason for it in the Bible and Prayer-book her good lady had given her. She had named her children after the prevailing custom of Puritans because she had heard the chaplain object to what he considered unhallowed heathenish names, but she had been heartily glad that they should be taught and catechised by the good vicar. Happily for her, in her country home, she did not live to see the strife brought into her own life.|$|E
60|$|It must be {{confessed that}} on this {{occasion}} the British philanthropist {{was willing to pay}} for what he <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> It was a noble national action, and one the morality of which was in advance of its time, that the British Parliament should vote the enormous sum of twenty million pounds to pay compensation to the slaveholders, and so to remove an evil with which the mother country had no immediate connection. It was as well that the thing should have been done when it was, for had we waited till the colonies affected had governments of their own it could never have been done by constitutional methods. With many a grumble the good British householder drew his purse from his fob, and paid for what he thought to be right. If any special grace attends the virtuous action which brings nothing but tribulation in this world, then we may hope for it over this emancipation. We spent our money, we ruined our West Indian colonies, and we started a disaffection in South Africa, the end of which we have not seen.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I <b>thought</b> it <b>was</b> <b>right,</b> Elinor," [...] said Marianne, [...] "to {{be guided}} wholly by {{the opinion of}} other people. I <b>thought</b> our {{judgments}} <b>were</b> given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours. This has always been your doctrine, I am sure." ...|$|R
5000|$|Asked {{whether she}} <b>thought</b> it <b>was</b> <b>right</b> {{to leave her}} parents without permission, she responded that she did so at the command of God and {{therefore}} [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>right</b> to do so," [...] further stating that [...] "afterwards, I wrote to them, and they forgave me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] said Maud, slowly, [...] "he <b>thought</b> he <b>was</b> <b>right</b> in {{demanding}} an explanation. There is great rivalry {{between the various}} film manufacturers and it was rather mean of the Corona to put my name on that placard." ...|$|R

60|$|In {{herself she}} {{regarded}} this passion of hers as a healthy man regards {{the loss of}} a leg or an arm. It is a great nuisance, a loss that maims the whole life,--a misfortune to be much regretted. But because a leg is gone, everything is not gone. A man with a wooden leg may stump about through much action, and may enjoy the keenest pleasures of humanity. He has his eyes left to him, and his ears, and his intellect. He will not break his heart for the loss of that leg. And so it was with Lucy Morris. She would still stump about and be very active. Eyes, ears, and intellect were left to her. Looking at her position, she told herself that a happy love could hardly have been her lot in life. Lady Fawn, she <b>thought,</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> A governess should make up her mind to do without a lover. She had given away her heart, and yet she would do without a lover. When, on one dull, dark afternoon, as she was thinking of all this, Lord Fawn suddenly put into her hands a cruelly long printed document respecting the Sawab, she went to work upon it immediately. As she read it, she could not refrain from thinking how wonderfully Frank Greystock would plead the cause of the Indian prince, if the privilege of pleading it could be given to him.|$|E

"But {{when she}} knew that Edward was alive, and had come back," [...] sobbed Dot, now {{speaking}} for herself, as she had burned to do, all through this narrative; [...] "and when she knew his purpose, she advised him by all means to keep his secret close; for his old friend John Peerybingle was much too open in his nature, and too clumsy in all artifice--being a clumsy man in general," [...] said Dot, half laughing and half crying--"to keep it for him. And when she--that's me, John," [...] sobbed the little woman--"told him all, and how his sweetheart had believed him to be dead; and how she had at last been over-persuaded by her mother into a marriage which the silly, dear old thing called advantageous; and when she--that's me again, John--told him they were not yet married (though close upon it), {{and that it would}} be nothing but a sacrifice if it went on, for there was no love on her side; and when he went nearly mad with joy to hear it,--then she--that's me again--said she would go between them, as she had often done before in old times, John, and would sound his sweetheart, and be sure that what she--me again, John--said and <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> And it WAS right, John! And they were brought together, John! And they were married, John, an hour ago! And here's the Bride! And Gruff and Tackleton may die a bachelor!

40|$|An {{important}} task for any community {{is to find}} a source of principled limits on the criminal law. This search is frustrated {{by the fact that the}} concept of wrongdoing, just like the contested concept of a crime itself, is open and empty of factual content. The ordinary definitions of wrongdoing, as conduct that deviates from a rule, standard or norm of conduct that <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> to <b>be</b> <b>right,</b> and of a crime as 'a legal wrong that can be followed by criminal proceedings which may result in punishment'l both leave undone the hard work of identifying in precise factual terms the conduct that ought to be forbidden by the criminal law and providing acceptable reasons why it <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> to <b>be</b> <b>right</b> to punish offenders who are responsible for that conduct...|$|R
