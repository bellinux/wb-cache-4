It's getting it off my chest. It is defensive, absolutely. But it's also sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek. And I'm not sorry. I do not apologize for any of it.|$|E
25|$|The way {{our studio}} {{operated}} was {{that anything that}} comes in – there’s no value judgments made about the music. We just record it. Still, one of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> guess was cool about being a staff engineer is that I wouldn’t have sought out a band like that. I wasn’t philosophically into anything that they were doing, {{but they were all}} good musicians – you would have to be to stay together at the speeds they were playing at. So there was that aspect of it, and just the whole pushing the envelope thing. It sounds like it’s just gonna completely break apart going 700 miles through the sky {{and then all of a}} sudden everything just comes right together again.|$|E
500|$|Blyton's {{range of}} plots and {{settings}} {{has been described}} as limited and continually recycled. Responding to claims that her moral views were [...] "dependably predictable", Blyton commented that [...] "most of you could write down perfectly correctly all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> believe in and stand for– you have found them in my books, and a writer's books are always a faithful reflection of himself". Many of her books were critically assessed by teachers and librarians, deemed unfit for children to read, and removed from syllabuses and public libraries.|$|E

500|$|Guitar {{was viewed}} by Sharrock as the {{culmination}} of a period in his career spent developing his sense of composition. After releasing his first record—Black Woman—in 1969, he experimented with different influences during the 1970s. When he recorded [...] "Dance with Me Montana" [...] in 1982, the song's chord progression changed his perspective on composing and inspired him to pursue more melodic ideas. [...] "You listen to , and it's like a blind man struggling {{to get out of a}} room", Sharrock recalled. [...] "Guitar was a crystallization of all of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had discovered in that song." [...] In the early 1980s, he had also worked on projects with Material, an experimental band fronted by Bill Laswell, who helped Sharrock produce the album.|$|E
500|$|During {{press for}} the popular 2015 film Straight Outta Compton, {{questions}} about the portrayal and behavior of Dr. Dre and other prominent figures in the rap community about violence against women – and the question about its absence in the film – were raised. The discussion about the film led to Dr. Dre addressing his past behavior in the press. In August 2015, {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone, Dre lamented his abusive past, saying, [...] "I made some fucking horrible mistakes in my life. I was young, fucking stupid. I would say all the allegations aren't true—some of them are. Those are some of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would like to take back. It was really fucked up. But I paid for those mistakes, and there's no way in hell that I will ever make another mistake like that again." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Blurred Lines" [...] was controversial: its {{video was}} called sexist for its {{perceived}} degradation of women, and some felt its lyrics promoted rape. Others disagreed, {{asserting that the}} lyrics supported female power and sexual freedom. Martel defended Ratajkowski's performance, saying: [...] "it's very, very funny and subtly ridiculing." [...] Ratajkowski {{did not think of}} the video as sexist and claimed that the producers, through the use of humor and sarcasm, [...] "took something that on paper sounded really sexist and misogynistic and made it more interesting". She said that the song [...] "gave me an opportunity to say <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> felt about feminism today and about women in general in pop culture." [...] Ratajkowski did not feel objectified and enjoyed performing in a sexual manner: the attention given to the nudity in the video, she said, shows that America has not advanced as far as it should have, and, she believes, society represses sexuality, which is bad for both sexes.|$|E

And I was like, 'Get out of here, I don't rap.' And he was like, 'Yeah you do. Just go in there, just do it.' He totally encouraged me. I had nothing planned, nothing written, and he just told me to do stream-of-consciousness, whatever I was thinking. Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk about <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> like.' So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it. So it was totally spontaneous." ...|$|E

Praise for Liverpool also came from outside England, including from Argentine legend Diego Maradona, who said, [...] "Even the Brazil team that won the 1970 World Cup could not have staged a comeback with Milan leading 3–0...The English club proved that miracles really do exist. I've now made Liverpool my English team. They showed that football {{is the most beautiful}} sport of all. You knew they could defend, but the team showed they could play too and wrote a page in the history books. The match will last forever. The Liverpool supporters didn't let me go to sleep the night before. There were 10 of them to every three Milan supporters. They showed their unconditional support at half-time when they were losing 3–0 and still they didn't stop singing." ...|$|E
500|$|Ultima Underworld is {{considered}} the first example of an immersive sim, a genre that combines elements from other genres to create a game with strong player agency and emergent gameplay, and has influence many games since its release. The game's influence {{has been found in}} BioShock (2007), and that game's designer, Ken Levine, has stated that [...] "all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do and all the games that I ended up working on came out of the inspiration I took from [...]" [...] Gears of War designer Cliff Bleszinski also cited it as an early influence, stating that it had [...] "far more impact on me than Doom". Other games influenced by Ultima Underworld include , Deus Ex, , , and Half-Life 2. Toby Gard stated that, when designing Tomb Raider, he [...] "was a big fan of ... Ultima Underworld and I wanted to mix that type of game with the sort of polygon characters that were just being showcased in Virtua Fighter." [...] Ultima Underworld was also the basis for Looking Glass Technologies' later System Shock.|$|E

500|$|The album's artwork is a computer-generated {{collage of}} images and text created by Stanley Donwood and Yorke, the latter {{credited}} under the pseudonym [...] "The White Chocolate Farm". Yorke commissioned Donwood {{to work on a}} visual diary alongside the recording sessions. Yorke explained, [...] "If I'm shown some kind of visual representation of the music, only then do I feel confident. Up until that point, I'm a bit of a whirlwind." [...] The blue-and-white palette was, according to Donwood, the result of [...] "trying to make something the color of bleached bone." [...] The image of two stick figures shaking hands appears in the booklet and on the compact disc itself. Yorke explained the image as emblematic of exploitation: [...] "Someone's being sold something they don't really want, and someone's being friendly because they're trying to sell something. That's what it means to me." [...] Explaining the artwork's themes, Yorke said, [...] "It's quite sad, and quite funny as well. All the artwork and so on... It was all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hadn't said in the songs." ...|$|E

Fans could vote between three alternative endings through Idols official website. Lopez said the idea behind giving fans the choice was {{to give them a}} chance to see what she experienced. [...] "You get to do what I do,... Like, I go in there with my videos and I start editing and picking all the shots I like and <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> like and what I feel the best kind of feeling for the record is. You guys get to do that. We picked two different ones and we weren't sure." [...] The alternative endings included three varying scenes: in the first, the video ends with a close-up of Lopez's face in the silver lace catsuit; the second ends with a shot of dancers defying gravity on the walls and ceiling, while the final ending ends with a shot of Lopez on the dance floor in her harem pants. The first ending was the one used in the final video.|$|E
500|$|Sean Hayes {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Jack. When a NBC casting {{executive}} saw Hayes's role in the indie gay romance film Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, he sent the script to Hayes, who was attending the 1997 Sundance Film Festival in Utah. Even though Hayes enjoyed the script when he read it, he threw it away as {{he did not want to}} spend money on a plane ticket to Los Angeles for the audition. However, a few weeks later when Hayes was in Los Angeles, he was sent the script again and decided to try out for the audition. If asked if he regrets accepting the role, Hayes said: [...] "If you're truly an actor, in the long run... I don't know that I would have done it either. I think of all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> still want to do, and I don't know if I'll get to do them." [...] However, he admits that he [...] "love" [...] the idea that people assume that he is either gay or straight.

500|$|When he {{took over}} as Bradford {{caretaker}} manager, Wetherall stepped down as captain and instead handed the armband to centre-back partner Mark Bower. But when McCall was appointed the new manager in June 2007, Wetherall was reinstated as club captain for the 2007–08 season. On 20 February 2008 he announced the 2007–08 season {{would be his last}} as a player, although Bradford City would keep his registration, and instead he would join the club's coaching staff. Wetherall said: [...] "I was becoming increasingly frustrated at not being able to do <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{used to be able to}} do. Situations I would normally deal with comfortably were suddenly becoming a struggle." [...] Bradford fans held a special day to celebrate Wetherall's career, when they took banners and wore fancy dress and laboratory coats during the club's 1–1 draw with Rotherham United on 22 March 2008. In his penultimate month as a footballer, Wetherall was also named the League Two fans' player of the month by the Professional Footballers' Association. He played his final game for Bradford against Wycombe Wanderers on 3 May 2008 in a 2–1 defeat.|$|E
500|$|On the surface, it {{may seem}} that the Smoking Man merely tries to hide {{information}} from Mulder and Scully, but {{there is much more}} to him. He is involved in the Syndicate, a shadow organization which includes members of the United States government that exists to hide from the public the fact that aliens are planning to colonize Earth. The Smoking Man often ruthlessly protects the secrets of the conspiracy, and serves as the main antagonist to Mulder, who has an equally consuming devotion to reveal the truth in the first seven seasons. His stated justification is a desire to prevent the alien colonization for as long as possible; in the episode [...] "One Breath", he tells Mulder that he is in the conspiracy (which he calls [...] "the game") because he believes that the secrets he keeps could, if publicly revealed, threaten the social order that preserves society: [...] "If people were to know of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> know... it would all fall apart". He is at times shown working towards that goal, particularly in connection with developing a vaccine to protect people from the [...] "black oil", a parasitic agent which the alien Colonists use to propagate themselves.|$|E
500|$|American Life is {{suffused with}} Ahmadzaï's {{characteristic}} production techniques, like stuttering instruments and vocals, oscillating loop tones recalling 1950s Sonar pulses, morphing vocals consisting of grunts and squeals and treatments {{that make the}} music freeze in between rhythms. The producer hoped that using stuttering would become a rage in the future world of recording. He believed that people think it is not natural to skip and stutter the music. But he used it {{to create a new}} groove. With the help of Pro Tools, he froze the audio at any point he wanted to change the rhythm of the tracks. Madonna discussed the recording of the title track stating that Ahmadzaï had encouraged her to rap spontaneously, about all the materialistic objects that she herself had been using and doing. They had an instrumental breakdown in [...] "American Life", where the producer encouraged Madonna to add a rap about her everyday life. [...] "Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk about <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> like'.

Additionally, {{in an interview with}} the Associated Press on the same day, Beyoncé revealed that the DVD will show more of her intimate side, stating: [...] "I felt like I've done so many different things, it's time for me to show a bit of who I am. The hardest thing was showing that, because a lot of things that I filmed, I filmed in my computer, and I would never have gotten so open if someone else was in the room." [...] On November 23, 2010, Beyoncé was interviewed by Cynthia McFadden on ABC's Nightline where she stated [...] "I feel like I wanted the fans to be able to see <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> see...
