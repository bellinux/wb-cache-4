5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} {{that if they}} can find the Isolus pod and provide it power, the alien will leave Chloe. A frantic Chloe draws the TARDIS and the Doctor, trapping them both {{in one of her}} sketches and forcing Rose to try to find <b>the</b> <b>pod</b> herself. She rationalises that <b>the</b> <b>pod</b> is located on the hottest spot on the street, a patch of freshly laid tar, and is able to dig it up. Meanwhile, Chloe has caused the entire crowd at the Olympic stadium to disappear and now is set on making everyone in the world disappear. Rose tries {{to find out how to}} power <b>the</b> <b>pod,</b> and uses visual indications from the Doctor's picture to understand that <b>the</b> <b>pod</b> needs heat mixed with emotion. Rose throws <b>the</b> <b>pod</b> towards the Olympic Torch - a symbol of hope, courage, and love - as it passes down the street. The missing children and the crowd at the Olympics reappear, and Rose realises that the drawing Chloe had made of her father will similarly come to life. Rose and Chloe's mother are able to calm Chloe by singing the Kookaburra song, causing the unseen monster - having fed off of Chloe's emotions and fears - to disappear.|$|E
5|$|Early {{conceptual}} {{designs of}} <b>the</b> <b>Pod</b> itself were based, as it {{existed in the}} novel, {{on one of the}} primary shapes in geometry, a dodecahedron, or a twelve-sided figure. Eventually <b>the</b> <b>Pod</b> was modified to a spherical capsule that encases the traveler. Zemeckis and the production crew also made several visits to the Kennedy Space Center at Merritt Island adjacent to Cape Canaveral, where officials allowed them access to sites off-limits to most visitors. Filmmakers were also brought onto Launch Complex 39 before the launch of the space shuttle. There, they concentrated on the mechanics of the elevator and the gantry area and loading arm. The resulting photographs and research were incorporated into the design of the machine's surrounding supports and gantry. Once the concept met with the filmmakers' approval, physical construction began on the sets for <b>the</b> <b>Pod</b> itself, the interior of the elevator, and the gantry, which took almost four months to build. The rest of the effects were compiled digitally by Imageworks.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{are readily}} {{propagated}} from seed. As seed {{is surrounded by}} irritating hairs within <b>the</b> <b>pod,</b> extraction requires care. Stem cuttings of semi-mature growth can be taken in late summer and require the application of rooting hormones and bottom heat.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{difference}} in <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> between <b>the</b> original film and the remake. In <b>the</b> original, <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> burst open and begin duplicating Miles and his friends while they are wide awake. In <b>the</b> remake, <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> and flowers stay dormant until the humans are asleep.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> seed <b>pods</b> grow to [...] long. As <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> mature, {{they range}} from green, to yellow and finally turn russet red-brown. <b>The</b> <b>pods</b> become {{leathery}} before splitting open during early winter,. <b>The</b> <b>pods</b> contain winged seeds inside. [...] In the wild, {{only two or three}} seed pods develop per flowerhead, but there may be anywhere from 5 to 50 in cultivated plants.|$|R
25|$|Loading <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> was {{accomplished}} {{on a set}} of parallel railway tracks, two tracks {{on either side of the}} aircraft. The front and back halves of <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> were positioned at the end of the tracks on loaders, with <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> below <b>the</b> line of the wings. The aircraft would taxi into position between the rails, and the loaders would then raise <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> into position for locking onto the spars. They would then drive towards the aircraft for mating.|$|R
5|$|Arroway falls {{unconscious}} as {{she begins}} traveling back through a wormhole. She awakens {{to find herself}} {{on the floor of}} <b>the</b> <b>pod,</b> the mission control team repeatedly hailing her. She learns that, from outside the machine, it appears <b>the</b> <b>pod</b> merely dropped through the machine's rings and landed in a safety net. Arroway insists that she was gone for approximately 18 hours, but her recording devices show only static. A Congressional Committee is formed and speculates that the Vega signal and machine were a hoax designed by the now-deceased Hadden. Although she cannot prove it happened, Arroway asks the committee to accept the truth of her testimony on faith. In a private conversation, Kitz and White House official Rachel Constantine reflect on confidential information that, although Arroway's recording device only recorded static, it recorded 18 hours of it. Arroway and Joss reunite, and Arroway receives ongoing financial support to expand the SETI program.|$|E
5|$|At Jupiter, Bowman leaves Discovery One in an EVA pod to {{investigate}} another monolith discovered {{in orbit around}} the planet. <b>The</b> <b>pod</b> is pulled into a vortex of colored light, and Bowman races across vast distances of space, viewing bizarre cosmological phenomena and strange landscapes of unusual colors.|$|E
5|$|Of the 50 B-52Bs built, 27 {{were capable}} of {{carrying}} a reconnaissance pod as RB-52Bs (the crew was increased to eight in these aircraft). The 300pound (136kg) pod contained radio receivers, a combination of K-36, K-38, and T-11 cameras, and two operators on downward-firing ejection seats. <b>The</b> <b>pod</b> required only four hours to install.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>pods,</b> {{preserved}} {{like those}} of the tamarind, can be eaten and are slightly aperient (laxative). Roasting <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> and seeds neutralizes the cytisine, the toxicalkaloid.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>pods</b> may {{sometimes}} feel claustrophobic, and their floating appearance deters acrophobes. Inner walls of <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> {{are lined with}} soundproof panels, which prevent echo and maximize audibility.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{propagate}} the bush, the seeds are collected in June when <b>the</b> seed <b>pods</b> split. <b>The</b> <b>pods</b> are air-dried {{for a few}} days and are then stored in moist soil before planting out during autumn. Putting <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> into moist soil gives some moisture to the pods; If <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> are fully dried out, it is more difficult for the seeds to sprout. Ideally, the plant should be planted in fertile, humus-rich soil with plenty of organic matter (in USDA zones 3 to 8).|$|R
5|$|The Oberon's log {{reveals that}} the apes on board, led by Semos, {{organized}} a mutiny and {{took control of the}} vessel after it crashed. The human and ape survivors of the struggle left the ship and their descendants are the people Leo has encountered since landing. The apes arrive and attack the humans who have gathered to see Leo, although he is able to even the odds when he uses the Oberons last fragments of fuel to fire a final blast at the first wave of apes. The battle is halted as a familiar vehicle descends from the sky and is identified immediately by Leo. <b>The</b> <b>pod</b> is piloted by Pericles, the chimp astronaut. Pericles was pushed forward in time as Leo was, and had just now found his way to the planet. When Pericles lands and <b>the</b> <b>pod</b> opens, the apes interpret his arrival as the return of Semos, the first ape, who is their god. They bow, and hostilities between humans and apes suddenly cease.|$|E
5|$|After about 10 days (1–3 weeks {{depending}} on temperatures), larvae hatch and bore directly throughout <b>the</b> <b>pod</b> walls and develop within the seed. Larvae are thus protected from {{biological and chemical}} control. Larval development lasts two to three months. Before entering its pupal stage, the larva cuts a circular cap. After around ten days of pupal stage, the adult emerges from the seeds. Because mating and oviposition are spread over a few weeks, adults can emerge before or after harvest.|$|E
5|$|As {{the torch}} bearer {{approaches}} the Olympic Stadium he collapses, and the Doctor promptly and suddenly appears, {{picks up the}} torch, and completes the run to light the Olympic Flame. The heat of the flame and the emotion of the crowd power <b>the</b> <b>pod,</b> allowing the Isolus to leave Chloe and return home. The Doctor and Rose walk off to watch the games, and Rose remarks that nothing will ever split {{the two of them}} up. The Doctor becomes uneasy and muses that a storm is approaching.|$|E
50|$|The Marines then {{attempt to}} reach <b>the</b> <b>Pods</b> via <b>the</b> tunnel network {{connecting}} {{them to the}} POC. Harrison is sent ahead to deactivate tunnel security so the Marines' APCs can proceed through. In the process, he accidentally cuts the security to <b>the</b> <b>Pods</b> themselves, which causes another breakout in which some of the Iron Bears are killed, but the team manages {{to go through the}} tunnels and arrive at <b>the</b> <b>Pods.</b>|$|R
30|$|Cocoa pod borer (CPB) infested pods were {{collected}} from the field after a phyto-sanitary operation in 2013. The pest CPB attacks both young and mature pods (DAFF 2014) and therefore <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> used comprised of materials of diverse biochemical composition. Before initiating the composting processes, <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> were subjected to phyto-sanitation procedures for preventing possible spread of the CPB pest. <b>The</b> <b>pods</b> were enveloped in thick (500  µ) polythene sacks under sun for seven days. <b>The</b> heating of <b>pods</b> by solarization ensured elimination of CPB eggs, larvae and pupae (Upadhyay et al. 2009). After 7  days of solar treatments, <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> were uncovered and diced into small fragments (1.0 – 3.0  cm 3) using machetes {{to serve as the}} feedstock for composts.|$|R
50|$|Croppings of {{indehiscent}} pods {{can occur}} by 4-6 years. <b>The</b> brown seed <b>pods</b> appear immediately after flowering and mature in 10 to 11 months. <b>The</b> <b>pods</b> are thick-walled, smooth, somewhat flattened and elliptical, but slightly curved with a short, curved point. <b>The</b> <b>pods</b> contain within them {{one or two}} bean-like brownish-red seeds, but {{because they do not}} split open naturally <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> need to decompose before the seeds can germinate. The seeds are about 1.5 - 2.5 cm long with a brittle, oily coat and are unpalatable to herbivores.|$|R
5|$|The {{scenes of}} Kirk and Scott {{approaching}} the Enterprise in drydock spanned two pages of script but took forty-five different shots—averaging one shot a day—for the travel pod containing Kirk {{to make its}} flight from the space office complex to the docking ring. Double shifts around the clock were required to finish the effect on time. For close shots of <b>the</b> <b>pod</b> traveling to the Enterprise, close-ups of Shatner and Doohan were composited into the model, while in long shots lookalike puppets were used.|$|E
5|$|The {{submarine}} {{is ordered}} to destroy Atlantis but Bond insists on rescuing Amasova first. He confronts and kills Stromberg but again encounters Jaws, whom he drops into a shark tank. However, Jaws kills the shark and escapes. Bond and Amasova flee in an escape pod as Atlantis is sunk. Amasova reminds Bond {{that she has}} vowed to kill him as she picks up Bond's gun. Then, she admits to having forgiven him and the two embrace. The Royal Navy recovers <b>the</b> <b>pod</b> and the two spies are seen in an intimate embrace through its port window, much to the bemusement of their superiors on the ship.|$|E
5|$|A cancer-stricken Hadden, now in {{residence}} on the Mir space station, reveals to Arroway {{that a second}} machine was secretly made in Japan, and that Arroway {{will be the one}} to go. Outfitted with several recording devices, Arroway enters the machine's pod, which is then dropped into four rapidly spinning rings, causing <b>the</b> <b>pod</b> to apparently travel through a series of wormholes. Arroway sees a radio array-like structure at Vega and signs of an advanced civilization on another planet. She then finds herself on a beach, similar to a childhood picture she drew of Florida, and a figure approaches that becomes her deceased father. Arroway recognizes him as an alien taking her father's form and attempts to ask questions. The alien tells her that the familiar landscape and form were used to make their first contact easier for her and that this journey was just humanity's first step to joining other spacefaring species.|$|E
50|$|The only {{anomalous}} {{event on}} the flight was the failure to recover <b>the</b> eight film-camera <b>pods.</b> They had landed downrange of the expected area, where Hurricane Gladys ruled out a continued search. However, two of <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> did wash ashore two months later. <b>The</b> <b>pods</b> were covered with barnacles, but the film inside was undamaged.|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} the final project of a student in ISR's 2008 Research Experiences for Undergraduates program. In {{a case of a}} bioterrorism attack, public health {{officials}} need to be prepared so the country, state, and counties are able to respond to any threat. The medication distribution problem specifically focuses on the state and local government levels of medication distribution to the points of dispensing (PODs). If health officials decide that mass dispensing of medication is needed, <b>the</b> <b>PODs</b> will be prepared as locations to administer the medication to the public. The state will then request medication from the federal government to be delivered to a state depot, where the medications will be stored until it is delivered to <b>the</b> <b>PODs.</b> <b>The</b> federal government will make multiple shipments, or waves, of medication to the depot. Likewise multiple shipments of medication will be made from the depot to <b>the</b> <b>PODs.</b> <b>The</b> health officials have two strategic alternatives in order to ensure timely deliveries are made to <b>the</b> <b>PODs.</b> 1. 	Using an LDC. A county may choose to operate a local distribution center (LDC) which receives medications from the depot. The LDC then distributes the materials to <b>the</b> <b>PODs</b> within <b>the</b> LDC’s jurisdiction. 2. 	Not using an LDC. The second strategic alternative for the counties is to forgo having an LDC so that the medication will be delivered from the depot directly to <b>the</b> <b>PODs.</b> Variable aspects of the problem include the routes used by the trucks to deliver the medication, the travel time of the trucks (travel time to <b>the</b> <b>PODs</b> and time to finish a route), time to load and unload the trucks, and the demand of medication per each <b>POD.</b> <b>The</b> best solution is determined by maximizing the probability that <b>the</b> <b>PODs</b> open on-time and do not run out of medication during operation. Assuming truck routes have already been determined, this paper addresses the scheduling aspect of mass medication distribution. The focus will be optimizing the schedules—deciding when a POD will receive a delivery and the amount of medication sent to <b>the</b> <b>PODs</b> during each delivery.

50|$|<b>The</b> seed <b>pods</b> of V. nilotica subsp. nilotica have a {{tannin content}} of about 25-33.8%. <b>The</b> <b>pods</b> without seeds have a tannin content of about 50%.|$|R
5|$|Baleen whales, {{primarily}} juveniles and calves, are preyed on by killer whales. It {{is thought}} that annual whale migration occurs to protect the calves from the killer whales. There have also been reports of a pod of killer whales attacking and killing an adult bowhead whale, by holding down its flippers, covering the blowhole, and ramming and biting until death. Generally, a mother and calf pair, {{when faced with the}} threat of a killer whale pod, will either fight or flee. Fleeing only occurs in species that can swim away quickly, the rorquals. Slower whales must fight <b>the</b> <b>pod</b> alone or with a small family group. There has been one report of a shark attacking and killing a whale calf. This occurred in 2014 during the sardine run when a shiver of dusky sharks attacked a humpback whale calf. Usually, the only shark that will attack a whale is the cookie cutter shark, which leaves a small, non-fatal bite mark.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Bernard uses Dr. Fred's family {{fortune of}} {{royalties}} from the Maniac Mansion TV series {{to purchase a}} real diamond, both Laverne and Hoagie manage to power their Chron-o-Johns, and the three are reunited in the present.

This time I know I can stop him!}} With only one Chron-o-John pod left, Bernard, Hoagie and Laverne use it to pursue the tentacles to the previous day, while Dr. Fred uselessly tries to warn them of using <b>the</b> <b>pod</b> together, referencing the film The Fly. Upon arriving, the trio exit <b>the</b> <b>pod</b> only to discover that they have been turned into a three-headed monster, their bodies merging into one during the transfer. Meanwhile, Purple Tentacle has used the time machine to bring countless versions of himself from different moments in time to the same day to prevent the Sludge-o-Matic from being deactivated. Bernard and his friends defeat the Purple Tentacles guarding the Sludge-o-Matic, turn off the machine and prevent the whole series of events from ever happening. Returning to the present, Dr. Fred discovers that the three have not been turned into a monster at all but have just gotten stuck in the same set of clothes; they are then ordered by Dr. Fred to get out of his house. The game ends with the credits rolling over a tentacle-shaped American flag, one of the more significant results of their tampering in history.|$|E
5|$|In the {{preparation}} of bean dip, various types of beans can be used, including black beans, pinto beans, kidney beans, white beans, fava beans, lima beans and edamame, a preparation of immature soybeans in <b>the</b> <b>pod.</b> Some bean dips incorporate several bean varieties into the dish, such as three-bean dip. Raw beans that are soaked and cooked are used, as are prepared canned beans and refried beans. The use of canned beans {{can result in a}} creamier dip, because beans prepared in canneries are pressure cooked in the can. Canned beans may have a salty flavor, which can be reduced by rinsing and then draining them. Fresh cooked beans may contribute to a more flavorful dish compared to using canned beans. Prepared canned green chili peppers are also sometimes used as a main ingredient.|$|E
50|$|For cultivation, <b>the</b> seed <b>pods</b> are {{collected}} once {{they start to}} spontaneously open on the tree. <b>The</b> collected <b>pods</b> are {{laid out in the}} sun so that <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> open up and release their seeds. The seeds can then be planted in sandy soil with sun exposure.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on {{the flowers}} and seeds of Acacia koa. They {{primarily}} feed upon the developing seeds within <b>the</b> <b>pods,</b> but they are at times found feeding in the flowers and buds. The larvae were reported to emerge from <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> and to pupate elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|In China, <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> {{are used}} for jin-jin braised meat dishes, {{particularly}} in the cuisine of the central-western province of Sichuan. <b>The</b> <b>pods</b> are often used in Vietnam, where they are called thảo quả and used as an ingredient in the broth for the noodle soup called phở.|$|R
5|$|Olds often {{lamented the}} lack of an {{internal}} gun in the F-4C he flew during his tour in Vietnam, but would not allow his fighters to be equipped with the gun pods then available. While he knew that he would be capable of effectively using them, he was also aware that none of his pilots were trained in the use of a gun or dogfighting. He also reasoned that the drag of <b>the</b> <b>pod</b> would both degrade the performance characteristics of the F-4 while not gaining it any advantage against the more maneuverable MiG-17s and MiG-21s, result in unnecessary losses strafing worthless targets, and reduce the number of bombs carried by the Phantoms, the delivery of which was the 8th's primary mission.|$|E
5|$|The group {{leaves the}} {{facility}} and emerges {{in a desert}} landscape on the Moon. The year is 2074 and most of humanity was killed by Radical-6 after it was unleashed by Free the Soul from a Mars mission test site in 2028. They re-enter the facility and discover a cold sleep pod. K explains that each person {{was brought to the}} facility to recreate the events that Zero Sr. and Akane had previously experienced. Clover, Alice, and Phi were abducted in 2028 and placed in cold sleep until the Nonary Game began. <b>The</b> <b>pod</b> opens to reveal a clone of Sigma, and K reveals he is actually Akane in disguise; in the timelines where Akane was killed, the armor was instead occupied by Sigma's clone, Kyle.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, Rebecca {{contacts}} the hacker, {{and says}} that she has convinced TriOptimum to authorize the station's destruction; she provides him with details {{on how to do}} this. After obtaining the necessary codes, the hacker initiates the station's self-destruct sequence and flees to the escape pod bay. There, the hacker defeats Diego a second time, then attempts to disembark. However, SHODAN prevents <b>the</b> <b>pod</b> from launching; it seeks to keep the player aboard the station, while the bridge—which contains SHODAN—is jettisoned to a safe distance. Rebecca tells the hacker that he can still escape if he reaches the bridge; SHODAN then intercepts and jams the transmission. After defeating Diego for the third time and killing him for good, the hacker makes it to the bridge as it is released from the main station, which soon detonates. He is then contacted by a technician who managed to circumvent SHODAN's jamming signal. The technician informs him that SHODAN can only be defeated in cyberspace, due to the powerful shields that protect its mainframe computers. Using a terminal near the mainframe, the hacker enters cyberspace and destroys SHODAN. After his rescue, the hacker is offered a job at TriOptimum, but he declines in favor of continuing his life as a hacker.|$|E
