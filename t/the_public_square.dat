The documents were subsequently paraded through the city in a mock funeral cortege, and burned down, one sheet at a time, in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>square</b> on Mitropoliei Hill.

5|$|On {{the night}} of 6November 1995, a fire {{broke out in the}} Rova compound, {{destroying}} or severely damaging all of its buildings. Once the flames had been extinguished, all that remained of the original structures were the stone shells of the royal chapel and Manjakamiadana. Fire-fighters arrived late at the scene. Their capacity to douse the fire was hampered by the discovery that their fire hoses did not properly fit onto the nearby hydrants. In addition, the water pressure at the hydrants was significantly reduced due to Analamanga hilltop's high elevation. As the fire-fighters battled the flames, numerous bystanders ran into Rova compound buildings to retrieve artefacts of historic and cultural significance. Approximately 1,675 objects were saved out of an estimated total of 6,700. Some pillaging is believed to have occurred. On {{the night of}} the fire, the body of one of the queens was found in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>square</b> in the centre of the city. A funeral vigil was held the following day for these royal remains. The remains were later identified as belonging to Ranavalona III, and have since been re-interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga.|$|E
