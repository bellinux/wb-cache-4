5|$|The constitutions of {{the cathedral}} chapter at Lichfield are often stated to have been Nonant's work, but this has been disproven. The chronicler Roger of Howden {{inserted}} a letter supposedly by Nonant in his Chronica. <b>This</b> <b>letter</b> was also preserved in other manuscripts, including a section of a manuscript now in the Bodleian Library as manuscript (MS) Additional A.44. <b>This</b> <b>letter</b> has now been published {{as part of the}} English Episcopal Acta series in the volume on the diocese of Lichfield and Coventry.|$|E
5|$|On {{the basis}} of <b>this</b> <b>letter,</b> Singapore argued that Abdul Rahman had only donated the {{mainland}} territories to Hussein and had retained sovereignty over all the islands in the sea. Pedra Branca therefore never {{became a part of}} Johor.|$|E
5|$|The Drapier's last letter, An Humble Address to Both Houses of Parliament, was {{completed}} in June 1725. It was written before Wood's patent was defeated, and it was stopped from being printed when word reached Swift that the patent had been withdrawn. <b>This</b> <b>letter</b> remained unpublished for 10years.|$|E

5|$|ALP's Letter {{becomes the}} focal point as it is {{analysed}} in detail in I.5. <b>This</b> <b>letter</b> was dictated by ALP to her son Shem, a writer, and entrusted to her other son Shaun, a postman, for delivery. The letter never reaches its intended destination, ending up in a midden heap where it is unearthed by a hen named Biddy. Chapter I.6 digresses from the narrative in order to present the main and minor characters in more detail, {{in the form of}} twelve riddles and answers.|$|E
5|$|In November 2007 someone {{claiming}} to be an al-Qaeda member sent Rambhadracharya a letter telling him and his disciples either to accept Islam or {{to be prepared to}} die. Police superintendent Kamal Singh Rathore said that <b>this</b> <b>letter</b> had been sent from Haridwar, that Rambhadracharya's security arrangements had been increased and that an intensive investigation of the letter had been carried out. Gita Devi, secretary of JRHU, said that Rambhadracharya had been threatened by al-Qaeda, as Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas president Nrityagopal had been in the past.|$|E
5|$|International {{attitudes to}} the {{federation}} were critical, {{particularly from the}} Afro-Asian bloc in the United Nations. At {{a time when most}} colonial powers were rushing their colonies towards independence, the federation seemed to its opponents to be an unwelcome obstacle. In Britain, Labour grew more critical, and African nationalists in the federation itself became more vocal, dissatisfied with the liberalisation that was taking place, and demanding faster moves towards African advancement. The Governor of Northern Rhodesia, Sir Arthur Benson, wrote a secret letter to his superiors in Britain, highly critical of Welensky and the federation; <b>this</b> <b>letter</b> remained undiscovered until 1958, when Huggins revealed it to Welensky.|$|E

60|$|At last {{it came to}} be <b>this</b> <b>letter's</b> turn, and the Major broke a seal with 'Fairoaks' {{engraved}} upon it, and 'Clavering St. Mary's' for a postmark. It was {{a double}} letter, and the Major commenced perusing the envelope before he attacked the inner epistle.|$|R
5|$|Pope Vitalian {{wrote to}} Oswiu after Wighard's death, and <b>this</b> <b>letter</b> is {{preserved}} by Bede in his Historia Ecclesiastica. In the letter, which also mentions that a messenger from Oswiu had {{been among the}} companions of the archbishop-elect, the pope apologises {{that he has been}} unable to find a successor to Wighard yet. Wighard's death in Rome allowed Vitalian the opportunity to choose his successor, and Vitalian chose his friend Theodore of Tarsus to become the next archbishop.|$|E
5|$|The {{obedience}} of Anacletus II may be reconstructed basing on {{the letter}} addressed to king Lothair III of Germany by his cardinals {{soon after his}} coronation. <b>This</b> <b>letter</b> bears the subscriptions of 27 cardinals, including five created by Anacletus II on February 21, a Friday of the ember week. To them should be added also cardinal Oderisio of S. Agata, who later subscribed the bulls issued by Anacletus II.|$|E
5|$|The second kingdom {{appears to}} be a {{powerful}} and prosperous political center, kings held the title of Lugal, and many are attested in the city, but the most important source is the letter of king Enna-Dagan c. 2350 BC, which was sent to Irkab-Damu of Ebla, and in it, the Mariote king mentions his predecessors and their military achievements. However, the reading of <b>this</b> <b>letter</b> is still problematic and many interpretations have been presented by scholars.|$|E

5|$|<b>This</b> <b>letter</b> {{is seen as}} {{the final}} salvo in the Drapier's fight against Wood's patent. Although there was a {{possible}} agreement between Carteret and Walpole over ending the patent, Swift found it necessary to publish this defence of the fourth letter to ensure that Walpole would not back down from his promise of removing the patent. It has also been seen as a letter celebrating Harding's release from being tried for printing the Drapier's letters.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>letter</b> was one {{of several}} that Travis sent during the siege of the Alamo. Each carried a similar message—the Mexican army had invaded Texas, the Alamo was surrounded, and the Texians needed more men and {{ammunition}} to wage a successful defense. No assistance was forthcoming from the Texas government. By this point infighting had rendered the provisional government completely ineffective, and delegates convened on March 1 at the Convention of 1836 to create a new government. Most of the delegates believed that Travis exaggerated the difficulties he faced.|$|E
5|$|Together with Mellitus, the Bishop of London, Justus {{signed a}} letter written by Archbishop Laurence of Canterbury to the Irish bishops urging the native church to adopt the Roman method of calculating the date of Easter. <b>This</b> <b>letter</b> also {{mentioned}} the fact that Irish missionaries, such as Dagan, had refused to share meals with the missionaries. Although the letter has not survived, Bede quoted from parts of it.|$|E
