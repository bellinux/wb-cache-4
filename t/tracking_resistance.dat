Five kinds of cable material i. e. non carbon filled crosslink polyethylene (XLPE), carbon filled XLPE, low density polyethylene (LDPE), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), and high density polyethylene (HDPE) were examined. The test specimen has a dimension of 10 mm in width, 50. 8 mm in length and 1. 52 mm in thickness. The test samples were classified into two groups for investigation. The former group was the new test samples, whereas the latter test samples were stressed by thermal ageing with 120 oC for 168 hours. Then both specimens were examined. One side of the specimen was contacted with high voltage electrode terminal made of 1 mm diameter Nichrome wire. Another side of the test specimen was dipped into 0. 1 percent solution of ammonium chloride as grounded electrode. The spacing between electrodes at dry area was determined for 25. 4 mm. After completion of the test set up, AC high voltage {{was applied to the}} test specimen. The dip rate of the specimen into the solution was set up as 4 times per minute. The test voltage level was in the range of 1 - 3. 5 kV. The experiment was performed in accordance with ICEA S- 66 - 524 (Method B). The test voltage was applied to the test specimen until the insulation failure could be observed. Then, the insulation failure voltage and failure time were recorded. The test results illustrated that both unaged and aged HDPE and non carbon filled XLPE provided the higher surface <b>tracking</b> <b>resistance</b> than carbon filled XLPE, LDPE and MDPE respectively.

Successful initiatives for containing the problem need to be communicated and disseminated.

40|$|Initially, {{each new}} {{antibiotic}} cured almost all bacterial infections. However, infecting bacteria {{then began to}} acquire  genes  that  blocked  the  antibiotic’s  action. Such  resistance  genes  arose somewhere by mutation or by transfer from obscure bacteria to an infecting strain, and were then driven from their origin by antibiotic use through genetic elements, bacterial strains, animals, and people, to different hospitals and continents. Such epidemics of resistance genes and the bacteria that carry them have spread resistant strains throughout the world. As these genes have spread through the global population of infecting bacteria, successive antibiotics have become ineffective and patients have died as a result. Efforts to control antibiotic resistance have not adapted to its epidemic spread. While caregivers {{at the local level}} make efforts to track and contain resistance in the hospital as a component of infection control, there is little tracking at state, national, or international levels.
