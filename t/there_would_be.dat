5|$|Days {{would be}} {{structured}} so that activities would be planned throughout, with occupational therapy carrying on into evenings and at weekends.

Between 2pm and 8pm <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more time in the occupation room, a period of rest and time in the garden. At 8 pm <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> community games and country dancing. Casson believed it was important to keep the therapy room separate {{from the rest of the}} department, as it was specialised knowledge. She also insisted that certain activities, such as knitting, were not used as it was not sufficient distraction from the patient's fantasy system. Some concern existed that patients would not accept being put to work, but of her 100 patients in 1931, only six refused the therapy. A member (and later fellow) of the British Homeopathy Society, Casson also included homeopathic treatments in her programme for the patients.|$|E

5|$|Fragments of Him {{originally}} {{stemmed from}} an idea developed at a game jam called the Ludum Dare. The game originally had players removing objects while {{the main character}} {{became more and more}} depressed. Mata Haggis, one of the developers of Fragments of Him, told the Rock, Paper, Shotgun blog that in the final version <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more mechanics than just removing objects. He said that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> some choices to be made, and that the story would branch off a little from the choices. The prototype of the game focused only on the boyfriend, while the full version was to include four different character perspectives. He described the gameplay style as a mix of Heavy Rain and Gone Home. Haggis told Nathan Grayson of the Kotaku blog that many of the objects in the game, such as hotels and parks, were based on his real-life experiences of when he lost a friend.|$|E
