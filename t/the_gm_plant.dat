25|$|The General Motors {{automotive}} {{assembly plant}} in South Fremont was the town's largest employer, and Fremont {{was known for}} its drag strip. In the 1980s <b>the</b> <b>GM</b> <b>plant</b> became a joint venture automotive assembly plant of Toyota and General Motors called NUMMI. Toyota and NUMMI shut down its operations in early 2010.

25|$|By 1990, Bieber {{was once}} more {{negotiating}} {{a contract with}} GM, but his control of the collective bargaining process was {{not as strong as}} in the past. A local struck <b>the</b> <b>GM</b> <b>plant</b> in Flint, Michigan, on August 8, 1990, about a month before the national contract with the company ended. Bieber {{had little to do with}} the strike, which was approved by GM Department Director Stephen Yokich (by now considered Bieber's most likely successor). The Flint strike complicated Bieber's attempts to negotiate a new national contract, and Yokich's approval of the local strike indicated Bieber's weakening control over the union. The Flint strike ended on August 15, but it had generated UAW member unrest with Bieber's leadership of the union. Bieber did not need a contract extension this time, and negotiated a contract identical in wage structure to the 1987 agreement. A Ford contract followed in early October 1990, and a Chrysler contract 20 days later, both of which were very similar to the GM agreement.|$|E

Fisker will invest a minimum of US$175 million in upgrading the plant. Production of hybrid sedans will begin as early as 2011 for the domestic market {{as well as for}} export through the Port of Wilmington. Fisker anticipates that the process will create approximately 2,500 jobs and contribute to Delaware’s effort to compete in the “green economy.” ...|$|E
30|$|Non-target {{butterflies}} {{are often}} highlighted as prominent examples of protection {{goals for the}} ERA of GMOs expressing lepidopteran-specific toxins (e.g. Bt crops). Lepidopteran non-target species may ingest the Bt toxins expressed in parts of <b>the</b> <b>GM</b> <b>plants</b> and be subject to sub-lethal or lethal effects [63]. About one-third of European butterflies show declining populations with agricultural intensification as the major cause for habitat loss or degradation [61].|$|R

30|$|The {{following}} two hybrids were used: PAN 6 Q- 321 B (GM MON 810) and PAN 6 Q- 121 (non-Bt near iso-hybrid for PAN 6 Q- 321 B). <b>The</b> <b>GM</b> <b>plants</b> express <b>the</b> Cry 1 Ab toxin targeting in Europe the European corn borer, O. nubilalis. They were grown in climate chambers at a fluctuating temperature of 20 °C (8 h/night) and 25 °C (16 h/day) and a relative humidity (RH) of 65 %.

Only recently, the first papers were published that documented the input of transgene products or transgene DNA into aquatic systems, headwater streams and rivers [45] and connected them to possible adverse effects on some aquatic organisms [46, 47]. Larger - and if possible coordinated - research and screening efforts are necessary to fully understand the spatio-temporal dimension of spread, persistence and bioactivity of the novel transgene products, like the Bt-toxins, and their metabolites embedded within or stemming from <b>the</b> <b>GM</b> <b>plants</b> in <b>the</b> various receiving ecosystems.|$|R

Moore sued for wrongful dismissal, and settled out of court for $58,000, providing him with seed money for his first film, Roger & Me.|$|E
50|$|ASOTRECOL {{alleges that}} its members {{incurred}} work-related injuries at <b>the</b> <b>GM</b> <b>plant,</b> and that GM illegally fired {{workers who were}} consequently unable to perform their work. ASTORECOL's 68 members suffer from various injuries associated with strenuous, repetitive motions, including: musculoskeletal problems, herniated discs, carpal tunnel, elbow and shoulder tendonitis, tinnitus (chronic ringing in the ears), elbow epicondylitis, knee problems, cancer, and spinal injuries. Many have undergone multiple surgeries. GM Colmotores denies all claims, asserting that its number one priority is {{the health and well-being}} of its workers.|$|E

40|$|Genetic {{engineering}} (GI) {{of plants}} {{is a very}} current topic, {{and more and more}} controversial, since it is becoming an inseparable part of our lives. GI has, among other things, a great potential to help solve the current problem of hunger and malnutrition in certain parts of the world. The goal of this project is to clarify what genetically modified (<b>GM)</b> <b>plants</b> are, to present the possibilities of their practical use, to explain methods of preparation and to consider their advantages and eventual risks. By <b>GM</b> <b>plant</b> we understand a plant whose genetic information has been changed by introducing or removing part of the genetic information (a section of DNA, generally a gene). The most frequently used methods of transformation are the transformation by Agrobacterium tumefaciens and <b>the</b> balistic method. <b>GM</b> <b>plants</b> can be used for production of food or feed in better quality and greater quantity, thanks to an introduction of higher resistance, whether it is to biotic stress (pest, virus or bacterial resistance) or to abiotic stress (drought, salinity, toxic substance in the ground [...] ). In particular, the resistance to abiotic stress is an important issue these days, since through the climate changes some regions suffer more and more from insufficient precipitation and consequent drought.

40|$|Genetically {{modified}} (<b>GM)</b> <b>plants</b> {{are increasingly}} used for food production and industrial applications. As the global population has surpassed 7 billion and {{per capita consumption}} rises, food production is challenged by loss of arable land, changing weather patterns, and evolving plant pests and disease. Previous gains in quantity and quality relied on natural or artificial breeding, random mutagenesis, increased pesticide and fertilizer use, and improved farming techniques, all without a formal safety evaluation. However, the direct introduction of novel genes raised questions regarding safety that are being addressed by an evaluation process that considers potential increases in the allergenicity, toxicity, and nutrient availability of foods derived from <b>the</b> <b>GM</b> <b>plants.</b> Opinions vary regarding {{the adequacy of the}} assessment, but there is no documented proof of an adverse effect resulting from foods produced from <b>GM</b> <b>plants.</b> This review and opinion discusses current practices and new regulatory demands related to food safety...|$|R

One small street, formerly leading into <b>the</b> <b>GM</b> <b>plant</b> from Montgomery Road (U.S. Route 22), was closed and developed into a mixed use complex named after a major tenant Matrixx Marketing and later Convergys Corporation complex.

The City of Cincinnati even considered annexing Norwood to help with financial problems, but the plan was rebuffed by Cincinnati Mayor Charles Luken, who said {{he had no intention of}} [...] "taking advantage of Norwood's misfortune."
