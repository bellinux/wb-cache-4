5000|$|The Altman {{portrait}} is dated 1660, {{when he was}} fifty-four years old. This was a year {{of anxiety}} for him. He had just been declared bankrupt. He saw his collection of art treasures disposed of at auction and himself deserted by his pupils and his friends, with no studio of his own in which to set up his easel. In this portrait we have a work of mature years, when he brought all the skill and resources of a lifetime to its creation.The lift of the eyebrows that wrinkle his forehead is that of whimsical impatience, yet the spark in his eyes denies defeat. The mouth is drawn and the mark of undeserved neglect {{is evident in the}} premature wrinkles, but a certain merry pride lurks in the <b>tilted</b> <b>cap</b> and raised head. A pang of pity shoots through us, only to be replaced by one of keen satisfaction that he, the neglected, is remembered and they, the aristocrats, are forgotten.Though this great artist lived several years longer, they were years of misery, and he painted only one more great work, [...] "The Syndics of the Cloth Hall," [...] now in the Ryks Museum in Amsterdam. His great reputation suffered an almost total eclipse, although to-day he is probably the most popular painter that ever lived. Yet he never lost his courage, and as we see him in this portrait he carries his head bravely and wears his hat jauntily, as if in defiance of the evils that engulfed him. Heretofore we may have felt acquainted with Rembrandt the painter, but now we know Rembrandt the man; for just so he must have looked to his neighbors in the troublous year 1660.|$|E

Among these were head shots of the player with no cap, in case he was traded or the team moved.

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 The northwest-trending Neogene Tualatin basin {{in northwestern}} Oregon is a {{pull-apart}} basin with approximately 750 m of post-middle Miocene structural relief. Gently <b>tilted</b> uplands <b>capped</b> by Columbia River Basalt Group surround the synclinal basin on all sides. Integrated gravity, aeromagnetic, and seismic reflection {{data indicated that}} the basin is underlain by 3 to 4 km of sub-horizontal, upper lower Eocene to middle Miocene age sedimentary and volcanic rocks. Up to 300 m of Columbia River Basalt overlie these older strata, in turn overlain by up to 400 m of late Miocene to Pleistocene, dominantly fluvio-lacustrine sediments. Late middle Eocene strong oblique convergence across the continental margin generated regional northeast-trending fissures in the forearc through which the Tillamook Volcanics and basalt of Waverly Heights erupted. Sinistral strike-slip faults, including the proto-Gales Creek-Mt. Angel structural zone, segmented the forearc into discrete blocks which rotated clockwise independently. A right-step in the Gales Creek-Mt. Angel system generated northeast-directed folding and faulting adjacent to the restraining bend, deforming rocks as young as upper Tillamook Volcanics. Regional uplift culminated in a late Eocene unconformity which removed the arkosic Spencer Formation northeast of the Gales Creek-Mt. Angel system, prior to subsidence of the forearc and burial by late Eocene and Oligocene tuffaceous sedimentary strata. The distribution of middle Miocene Columbia River Basalt Group flows shows {{no evidence of a}} structural or topographic Tualatin basin at that time. The syncline initiated along the present southwestern margin of the basin in late Miocene time, in response to uplift of the Coast Range and Portland Hills anticlines to the southwest and northeast, respectively. A late Pliocene decrease in convergence and consequent relative increase in the oblique component of convergence reactivated the Gales Creek-Mt. Angel structural zone as a dextral shear zone. The right-step acted as a releasing bend, allowing extension, increased subsidence and normal faulting along the basin margins, and volcanism within the basin. Subsequent development of transverse folds and reverse faults, northwest-trending riedel shears, northeast-trending antithetic faults, and basin-marginal normal faults, is consistent with classification of the Tualatin basin as a pull-apart basin in a dextral wrench system...|$|R
40|$|Ab initio {{calculations}} of the six-dimensional intermolecular potential {{have shown the}} benzene dimer to be an asymmetric top molecule at equilibrium with one benzene moiety forming the "stem" {{and the other a}} "tilted cap" in a T-shaped structure. Internal rotation of the cap about its C 6 axis is essentially free; the barriers for <b>cap</b> <b>tilting</b> and for internal rotation of the stem about its C 6 axis are hindered by successively higher barriers. In previous work we have validated these theoretical results using Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy in conjunction with dynamics calculations. We have also measured the Stark effect, {{and despite the fact that}} the equilibrium structure is that of an asymmetric top, the assigned transitions involving K = 0 exhibit a second-order Stark effect whereas those involving K = 1 exhibit a first-order Stark effect. This is typical for a symmetric-top molecule, but anomalous for an asymmetric-top molecule. We use symmetry arguments to explain how this asymmetric-top molecule can have a first-order Stark effect in certain states that have excitation of cap internal rotation. Cap internal rotation is essentially the twisting of the monomers relative to each other about the intermolecular axis, and such torsional motion occurs in other asymmetric top dimers such as benzene-CO and benzene-H 2 O. These latter dimers will also have levels that exhibit a first-order Stark effect, which we can explain using our symmetry arguments. 9 2013 American Chemical Society.

40|$|The Fenghuoshan Group {{marks the}} {{initiation}} of terrestrial deposition in the Hoh Xil Basin and preserves the first evidence of uplift above sea level of northern Tibet. The depositional age of the Fenghuoshan Group is debated as are the stratigraphic relationships between the Fenghuoshan Group and other terrestrial sedimentary units in the Hoh Xil Basin. We present new radiometric dates and a compilation of published biostratigraphic data which are used to reinterpret existing magnetostratigraphic data from the Fenghuoshan Group. From these data, we infer an 85 – 51 [*]Ma depositional age range for the Fenghuoshan Group. U‐Pb detrital zircon age spectra from this unit are compared to age spectra from Tibetan terranes and Mesozoic sedimentary sequences to determine a possible source terrane for Fenghuoshan Group strata. We propose that these strata were sourced from the Qiangtang Terrane and may share a common sediment source with Cretaceous sedimentary rocks in Nima Basin. Field relationships and compiled biostratigraphic data indicate that the Fenghuoshan and Tuotuohe Groups are temporally distinct units. We report late Oligocene ages for undeformed basalt flows that <b>cap</b> <b>tilted</b> Fenghuoshan Group strata. Together, our age constraints and field relationships imply exhumation of the central Qiangtang Terrane from the Late Cretaceous to earliest Eocene, followed by Eocene‐Oligocene deformation, and shortening of the northern Qiangtang and southern Songpan‐Ganzi terranes.

The coordination about the copper(II) atom is a distorted version of a 4 + 2 elongated octahedron with the pronounced tetragonal distortion arising from long Cu-N and Cu-S axial bonds of 2. 447 (5) and 2. 600 (2) Angstrom, respectively. The presence of longer Cu-S bonds (2. 436 (2), 2. 600 (2) Angstrom) cis to shorter Cu-N bonds (2. 012 (5), 2. 029 (5) Angstrom) results in a <b>tilting</b> of the <b>capping</b> groups {{in relation to the}} pseudo- 3 -fold axis of the metal complex, the two caps being eclipsed with respect to one another. The randomly orientated frozen solution EPR spectrum and low-temperature (similar to 10 K) absorption spectrum are indicative of an orthorhombically distorted complex with a pronounced tetragonal elongation, consistent with the crystal structure determination and room-temperature magnetic moment of 1. 75 mu(B). Computer simulation of the randomly orientated frozen solution X-band EPR spectrum yielded g(z) = 2. 189, g(x) = 2. 048, g(y) = 2. 074, and A(z) = 160. 5 x 10 (- 4) cm(- 1). Ligand nitrogen hyperfine coupling was not resolved on the M(I) = - 1 / 2 parallel resonance at S-band microwave frequencies, presumably a consequence of the low symmetry around the Cu(II) ion.

40|$|This paper investigates {{comparing}} the financial performance for {{socially responsible investment}} equity indices and conventional investment equity indices in the United States, accounting for the recent financial crisis. Two conventional indices are used as a benchmark to four socially responsible indices. The conventional indices used in this paper are the S&P 500 Index and CRSP Total Market Index. The socially responsible indices used are the Calvert Social Index, FTSE 4 Good U. S. Select Index, FTSE 4 Good U. S. 100 Index and the MSCI KLD 400 Social Index. The time period for this investigation is from 2 nd January 2001 to 25 th June 2013. There is one primary objective and two minor objectives. To obtain results for the primary objective, we first must obtain results for minor objective 1. The first minor objective is to establish sub-periods by using the GARCH (1, 1) volatility model {{to coincide with the}} financial crisis. The illustrated volatility graph identifies four break-points; Panel A (January 2001 to June 2013 - Whole period); Panel B (January 2001 to September 2008 - pre- financial crisis); Panel C (September 2008 to March 2009 - during financial crisis); Panel D (March 2009 to August 2011 - post-financial crisis/pre-debt crisis); and Panel E (August 2011 to June 2013 - during-debt crisis). Once sub-periods are established, we are able to obtain results for the primary objective and minor objective two. The primary objective is to compare the financial performance for both conventional and SRI indices, for the whole period and sub-periods. Measures used to do this are the Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, Treynor ratio and Jensen's alpha. Statistical tests are performed for the Sharpe ratio (Jobson and Korkie (1981) Transformed Sharpe Measure) and Jensen's Alpha (Welch-Two Sample T-test). Our findings suggest that financial performance of SRI indices do not differ significantly from conventional indices. However, one major observation we notice is that whilst all SRI indices outperform the S&P 500 Index, they fail to outperform the CRSP Total Market Index. The second major observation is the change in investment behaviour by investors. We notice from 2001 to 2008, and 2008 until 2013, are periods of transition from conventional investing to socially responsible investing. In addition, from 2001 to 2007 (before the financial crisis), volatility was greater for SRI indices than conventional indices. However, after the financial crisis, volatility for conventional indices were greater than SRI indices. The second minor objective was to obtain information on the investment styles for SRI and conventional indices. For this, we employed the Fama and French (1993) 3 -factor model and the Carhart (1997) 4 -factor model. For both models, we found the alphas for S&P 500 and SRI indices to be negative and statistically significant. Second, we find the S& 5 P 00, Calvert Social Index, FTSE 4 Good U. S. and FTSE 4 Good U. S. 100 indices to have more market risk. Third, for the whole period, we find the S&P 500 and four SRI indices to have a small <b>tilt</b> towards large <b>cap</b> stocks. Finally, we find that whilst the S&P 500 is tilted towards stocks with a high-book-to-market ratio, all four SRI indices are titled towards stocks with a low-book-to-market ratio (or growth stocks). However, only the Calvert Social Index, FTSE 4 Good U. S Index and MSCI KLD 400 Social Index are statistically significant for the whole period...|$|R
