2500|$|Engineer Jean-Baptiste Berlier {{proposed}} to the City of Paris to finance {{and build a}} new line linking the areas of Montmartre and Gare Saint-Lazare in the north with Montparnasse and Vaugirard in the south. The line would establish a second north-south <b>transport</b> <b>axis</b> of the city, west of the existing line four. Berlier's design of two deep, parallel, iron-lined tunnels was modelled on the London Underground system. This method allowed the straightest line possible to be built, without passing underneath buildings and free from interference with underground sewers. The City Council liked the plan and on 28 December 1901 granted the tender for a Montparnasse-Montmartre line to Messrs Janicot and Berlier. In June 1902, a new company, new competitor of the [...] "Parisian Metropolitan Rail Company" [...] (CMP), was established : the Nord-Sud Company (in French [...] ).

50|$|Johanniskreuz {{has always}} been a central {{communication}} hub in the Palatine Forest. Whilst the most important historic link from Speyer to Metz ran from east to west and the area around Johanniskreuz was also part of the northern route of the Palatine St. James' Ways, today the main <b>transport</b> <b>axis</b> is the B 48 federal highway from Annweiler to Hochspeyer which runs from north to south. From the Queich valley to Hochspeyer, Johanniskreuz is the only settlement on this very route, which is very winding especially in the north. Also important from a transport perspective is the equally winding state road through the Elmstein Valley towards Neustadt an der Weinstraße. Other road links in a western direction through the Karlstal to Trippstadt and southwest - Heltersberg, Waldfischbach-Burgalben - in places follow paths that were used in the Middle Ages.|$|E

In the Upper Middle Rhine Valley, the breakthrough by the Rhine through the Rhenish Slate Mountains created this configuration. The valley with its steep rocky slopes, which forced users to create terraces, which shaped the valley over the centuries. It was particularly influenced by the vineyards on terraces (since the 8th century), shale mining and coppicing. Agriculture was possible only on the plateaus. The valley is unique in its variety of over 40 castles along only 65 km of the stream. The Upper Middle Rhine Valley is the epitome of the Romantic Rhine landscape and also a traditional <b>transport</b> <b>axis</b> (important shipping lane, two highways and two railway lines).|$|E
50|$|By {{the use of}} the radar, the British force ambushed the Axis convoy in the dark. As {{the convoy}} passed a buoy marking sandbanks, the British opened fire at 2000 yd and closed to as near as 50 yd. Three of the <b>Axis</b> <b>transports</b> were sunk, and the other two beached on the sandbar and became a total loss. Lampo was run aground and later salvaged, while Baleno sank in shallow waters. The {{flotilla}} commander, Commander de Cristofaro, on board Tarigo, had his leg shot off and later died of his wounds; he was posthumously awarded the Medaglia d'Oro (the highest Italian military decoration). While listing to port and sinking, Tarigo (now under the command of the only surviving officer, Ensign Ettore Bisagno) launched two torpedoes which hit HMS Mohawk. Mohawk was subsequently scuttled by HMS Jervis, and settled on the sandy bottom at a depth of 12 meters. The outcome of the battle marked the end of the relatively unopposed <b>Axis</b> <b>transport</b> to Libya, which they had enjoyed since June 1940.|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} proton energy-deposition {{experiments}} {{was conducted to}} measure the energy deposited in a copper target located downstream and off-axis of a high-energy proton-radiography target. The proton/target interactions involved low-intensity bunches of protons at 24 GeV/c onto a spherical target consisting of concentric shells of tungsten and copper. The energy-deposition target was placed at five locations downstream of the proton-radiography target, off-axis of the primary beam transport, and was either unshielded or shielded by 5 or 10 cm of lead. Maximum temperature rises measured in the energy-deposition target due to single bunches of 5 x 10 {sup 10 } protons on the proton-radiography target were approximately 20 mK per bunch. The data indicated that the scattered radiation was concentrated downstream {{and close to the}} primary <b>transport</b> <b>axis</b> of the beam line. The energy deposited in the energy-deposition target was reduced by moving the target radially away from the primary <b>transport</b> <b>axis.</b> Lead shielding in front of the target further reduced the energy deposition. The measured temperature rises of the energy-deposition target were empirically correlated with the distance from and the number of protons incident on the proton-radiography target, the thickness of the lead shielding, and the angle of the energy-deposition target off-axis of the beam line from the proton-radiography target. The correlation of the experimental data provides a starting point for the evaluation of the shielding requirements for devices downstream of proton-radiography targets such as superconducting magnets...|$|E

40|$|The AmtB channel passively {{allows the}} {{transport}} of NH 4 (+) across the membranes of bacteria via a "gas" NH 3 intermediate and is related by homology (sequentially, structurally, and functionally) to many forms of Rh protein (both erythroid and nonerythroid) found in animals and humans. New structural information on this channel has inspired computational studies aimed at clarifying various aspects of NH 4 (+) recruitment and binding in the periplasm, {{as well as its}} deprotonation. However, precise mechanisms for these events are still unknown, and, so far, explanations for subsequent NH 3 translocation and reprotonation at the cytoplasmic end of the channel have not been rigorously addressed. We employ molecular dynamics simulations and free energy methods on a full AmtB trimer system in membrane and bathed in electrolyte. Combining the potential of mean force for NH 4 (+) /NH 3 translocation with data from thermodynamic integration calculations allows us to find the apparent pKa of NH 4 (+) {{as a function of the}} <b>transport</b> <b>axis.</b> Our calculations reveal the specific sites at which its deprotonation (at the periplasmic end) and reprotonation (at the cytoplasmic end) occurs. Contrary to most hypotheses, which ascribe a proton-accepting role to various periplasmic or luminal residues of the channel, our results suggest that the most plausible proton donor/acceptor at either of these sites is water. Free-energetic analysis not only verifies crystallographically determined binding sites for NH 4 (+) and NH 3 along the <b>transport</b> <b>axis,</b> but also reveals a previously undetermined binding site for NH 4 (+) at the cytoplasmic end of the channel. Analysis of dynamics and the free energies of all possible loading states for NH 3 inside the channel also reveal that hydrophobic pressure and the free-energetic profile provided by the pore lumen drives this species toward the cytoplasm for protonation just before reaching the newly discovered site...|$|E
