5|$|Treloar {{returned}} to the AWM on 2September 1946 and was formally discharged from the Army in 1947. At the time he believed {{he was suffering from}} bad health, but wanted to resume his work at the Memorial rather than enter hospital. While Clarissa Treloar remained in Melbourne, their daughter Dawn moved to Canberra and took up a position in the Memorial's library. Treloar continued to work long hours in the years after the war. He lived in a cubby hole next to his office and signed the attendance book while walking from bed <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk.</b> Bean later claimed that Treloar had personally managed all areas of the Memorial other than its library. While Dawn provided him with company, family members and AWM staff believed that Treloar was lonely and did not have a social life. His letters to the official artists engaged by the AWM were frequently relaxed, however, and he became friends with Leslie Bowles and William Dargie. While Treloar was a teetotaler and non-smoker, he occasionally shared wine and cigarettes with Dargie.|$|E

He drew with a music score pinned <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> to work out the choreography so he could relate the action to the melody and the counterpoint, [...] "those nasty little notes underneath... so something has to be related to that". The studio filmed professional dancers Joyce Coles and Marjorie Belcher wearing ballet skirts that resembled shapes of blossoms that were to sit above water for Dance of the Flutes.

[...] Wilson defended Revels's election, and presented as evidence of its validity signatures from the clerks of the Mississippi House of Representatives and Mississippi State Senate, {{as well as that of}} Adelbert Ames, the military Governor of Mississippi. [...] Wilson argued that Revels's skin color was not a bar to Senate service, and connected the role of the Senate to Christianity's Golden Rule of doing to others as one would have done to oneself. [...] The Senate voted to seat Revels, and after he took the oath of office Wilson personally escorted him <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> as journalists recorded the historic event.|$|E

After 35 years of information gathering, he moved into a single room in Des Moines to start producing a compendium worthy of print.

Working day and night, sleeping in a bed placed close <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk,</b> he toiled over the Compendium from 1904 until 1908, producing a 4,025 page typed manuscript.

[...] According to an auspice he had received, the Emperor believed that his death would be at midday. [...] As a result, he was always restless around that time. On the day of the assassination, Domitian was distressed and repeatedly asked a servant to tell him what time it was. The servant, who was himself one of the plotters, lied to the emperor, telling him that it was already late in the afternoon.

500|$|A {{number of}} scenes and lines in [...] "The Duel" [...] were improvised by the actors. During one scene, Michael {{repeatedly}} tries to tell Andy about Angela's affair, but Jim constantly interrupts him while forcing {{him into his}} office. John Krasinski improvised most of his lines and noises, and Wilson said they were so funny, [...] "I was just chortling over at my desk". The scene as it appears in the episode consists of about six different takes spliced together. Krasinski also conceived a moment in [...] "The Duel" [...] when Jim returns <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> by awkwardly passing through Dwight and Andy while they are facing off against each other. Wilson called the addition to the scene [...] "a really nice touch". During another scene, Dwight sings a nursery rhyme that goes, [...] "Learn your rules, you better learn your rules, if you don't, you'll be eaten in your sleep!" [...] Celotta and Wilson came up with several versions of the song, but the one {{that appeared in the}} final episode was conceived by Wilson.|$|E
500|$|The episode debuted {{the series}} as a midseason {{replacement}} for the 2004–05 season. The pilot is a direct adaptation of the first episode of the British version. Daniels had decided {{to go through this}} route because [...] "completely starting from scratch would be a very risky thing to do" [...] due to the show being an adaptation. Although the episode was primarily adapted from the first episode of the British series, it was partially re-scripted in an attempt to [...] "Americanize" [...] it. [...] Jokes such as Dwight's stapler being put in Jell-O by Jim were transferred verbatim from the original series, while others were only slightly changed. [...] Although later reshot, a scene in which Jim tapes pencils <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> was originally filmed as a parallel to a scene in the British version, in which Tim Canterbury stacks up cardboard boxes in front of Gareth Keenan to restrict Keenan's view of Canterbury. [...] "Pilot" [...] was filmed almost six months prior to beginning of filming on the second episode of the season, [...] "Diversity Day". The Office used no laugh tracks in the [...] "Pilot", wanting its [...] "deadpan" [...] and [...] "absurd" [...] humor to fully come across.|$|E
500|$|The Supreme is also {{revealed}} to be power-crazed in other ways. Michiko Kakutani writes [...] "Francia, it seems, wants to account for everything (his own history, {{as well as the}} history of his nation, which he personifies as its leader) as he pours out his story, it becomes clear that he possesses an insatiable desire for power and control—he has even chained a huge meteorite <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk,</b> as punishment for being a cosmic runaway—and that he also sees himself as two separate beings: as a conniving, paranoiac [...] "I", beset by the average ego's fears and doubts, and as the [...] "Supreme", a monstrously powerful presence that even Francia himself must refer to in the third person." [...] The Supreme was personally involved in the affairs of the state to such extent, that it was reported by contemporary press that [...] " [...] personally trained his cavalry {{in the use of the}} saber, ascertained the exact number of nails in Fort Orange, awarded 102 pesos to a Frenchman whose anchor had been melted down by the state... lowered the price of salt in the capital, donated state yerba to the people of Saladillo, and denied permission for [...] to marry in Villa Rica."

500|$|After {{development}} of the original [...] was finished, the writer and director Shu Takumi's boss, Shinji Mikami, told him that they should make an Ace Attorney trilogy, with a grand finale in the third game's last case. Development of the game began immediately when Takumi returned to work from his vacation: the producer, Atsushi Inaba, called him in to a meeting, and told Takumi that he wanted him to write the script for five episodes before the game went into full production, with a deadline of {{three and a half}} months. Takumi thought that this was [...] "completely insane", as it had taken him an average of more than a month to write each of the four episodes for the first Ace Attorney; additionally, he felt {{that he did not have}} any [...] "tricks" [...] left to use for mysteries or any story threads to work off of. He wanted to protest, but still ended up having to do it. As soon as he returned <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk,</b> he drafted a work schedule: he scheduled two and a half month to write the dialogue, with half a month per episode, leaving him with a month to create the first prototype and figure out the [...] "tricks" [...] to be used in the mysteries. He doubted that he would be able to do it in time, but managed to write the whole script by the deadline. However, due to issues with memory on the game's cartridge, one episode ended up having to be cut from the game; it was later used as the third episode of the third game.|$|E
500|$|Kelly and Darryl’s {{continuing}} relationship {{proves to}} be dysfunctional, as she cannot comprehend his candor, and he finds her to be attractive yet [...] "crazy." [...] Creed Bratton (played by the real-life Creed Bratton) advises Michael to declare bankruptcy, which Michael does literally by walking {{into the office and}} shouting [...] "I declare bankruptcy!", thinking this was all he needed to do. Upon reviewing Michael's financial situation, Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) finds that Michael spends a large amount on useless items like magic kits and bass fishing equipment. Meanwhile, Jim and Pam feel sorry for Dwight and attempt to cheer him up by posting a positive review of his bed & breakfast on TripAdvisor.com, which pleases him. [...] However, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) gains Angela's approval to ask her out on a date by giving her the cat (named Garbage) that Dwight had tried to give Angela earlier, sending Dwight spiraling into crushing depression. Dwight retreats to the stairwell to moan. Jim joins him and recounts his days pining for Pam and how miserable it made him feel, saying he would not wish it on his worst enemy, Dwight included, to experience it, and Dwight realizes that he is not without friends. Having re-opened his old memories, Jim re-enters the office, goes right to Pam and kisses her passionately, and indirectly confesses {{in an interview that he}} loves her. Jim is quietly pleased when Dwight returns <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> along with his annoying and overbearing personality. Jan learns of Michael's dismal finances by phone, and immediately harangues Michael about being irresponsible. [...] He panics and attempts to hop a nearby train. [...] However, the train is slowing down and comes to a complete halt, upon which he is seen sitting on the train singing to himself. Jan speeds to the office and Oscar tells her in which direction Michael ran. She then runs to the train yard. She tells him that she will stand by him as he did when she was fired. Eventually, they leave the train yard hand in hand.|$|E
500|$|When {{choosing}} {{candidates for}} the Tatsunoko and Capcom character rosters, the development team was free to nominate any character it wished. However, the team faced limitations on its Tatsunoko candidates; Niitsuma explained, [...] " [...] had to consider licensing issues. Once we had that list we {{had to figure out}} how to make a balanced fighting game. On top of that we wanted a good balance between male and female characters." [...] Selection emphasis was placed on main characters, rather than on villains. Certain characters were denied by Tatsunoko Production without explanation to Capcom. [...] "We weren't privy to a lot of their decision making process. They didn't share a lot of reasons with us. When they said no and we asked why, they wouldn't tell us, but would give us another suggestion," [...] Niitsuma said. They disallowed characters from Genesis Climber MOSPEADA or Samurai Pizza Cats, despite the high number of fan requests for the latter. The eponymous characters of Tatsunoko's Muteking, The Dashing Warrior and Nurse Witch Komugi were among those planned for inclusion, but were eventually scrapped. The finalized Tatsunoko cast consists of characters that the team enjoyed in their youth. The development team hoped to include Capcom's Phoenix Wright and Franziska von Karma from the Ace Attorney series, but, while the latter's use of a whip made her easy to incorporate, the team struggled to find appropriate attacks for Phoenix. Since Phoenix doesn't move from the waist down in his original game environment, the team considered adding tires <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> and having the entirety move as a single character. However, this was abandoned due to potential collision issues. Though they envisioned an attack that used his catch-phrase [...] "", with the letters themselves used to attack the opponent, they found that localization would have changed the Japanese four-character phrase (in kanji) to a ten-letter word in English, unbalancing the game. Arthur from Ghosts 'n Goblins, and Ingrid from Capcom Fighting Evolution were also scrapped.|$|E
