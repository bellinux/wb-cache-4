2500|$|A {{number of}} {{researchers}} and former military personnel contend that the United States carried out Black operations against Iranian military targets during the war. Lt. Col. Roger Charles, {{who worked in the}} Office of the Secretary of Defense at <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon,</b> <b>says</b> the Navy used specially equipped Mark III patrol boats during the night, with the intent of luring Iranian gunboats away from territorial waters, where they could be fired upon and destroyed. [...] "They took off at night and rigged up false running lights so that from a distance it would appear there was a merchant ship, which the Iranians would want to inspect." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Pentagon {{estimated}} that 26,000 service members experienced unwanted sexual contact in 2012, up from 19,000 in 2010. Of those cases, <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>says,</b> most involved attacks on men, mostly by other men. Recent {{statistics show that}} in terms of number of assaults, “the majority of the victims are men.” It also states that although rare, women have previously aided men in sexually assaulting other women. According to statistics released by the Department of Defense, in fiscal 2012, more men were victims of sexual abuse than women. Turchik and Wilson found that “one problem that may be unique for men is confusion concerning sexual identity, masculinity, and sexual orientation after an assault, especially if the perpetrator is a man,” and that “homosexual victims may…feel that the assault was a punishment for being gay, whereas heterosexual victims may feel confused about sexuality and masculinity, especially if their body sexually responded during the assault.” Studies of male sexual assault victims have shown that they become more prone to emotional, physical, and social difficulties after being assaulted, which is comparable to women. This shows that “regardless of the victim’s gender…the consequences of sexual assault are both far reaching and acute.” However, “U.S. military rape law applies only to female victims and male perpetrators,” which “promotes the rape myths that men cannot be raped, and that women cannot be perpetrators.” ...|$|E
5000|$|On January 11, 2007, {{while being}} interviewed on WFED's morning program The Federal Drive, then-Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Detainee Affairs Charles [...] "Cully" [...] Stimson criticized some major U.S. law firms for {{representing}} detainees at Guantanamo Bay free of charge. Stimson further suggested that U.S. corporations who retained these same U.S. law firms should reconsider their associations with those firms. His comments drew immediate criticism from legal scholars, professional legal associations and the ACLU, and even <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> itself sought to distance {{itself and the}} Bush administration from Stimson's comments. Although he apologized a few days later, on February 2, 2007 Stimson resigned his position with <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon,</b> <b>saying</b> he believed <b>the</b> flap would prevent him from effectively doing his job. The controversy broadened the reputation of Federal News Radio, however, as the station's morning hosts and reporters were interviewed by news organizations around the world about the controversy.|$|R

Nowhere in those phone calls home did he say, 'let everyone know that I died a proud gay officer.'" [...] Ben McGrath, the author of the article, then comments, [...] "Of course, being a proud gay officer is tantamount, under the current military policy, to being a retired gay officer with no pension." ...|$|R

5000|$|The main {{difficulty}} {{in solving the}} puzzle is overcoming the functional fixedness of putting <b>the</b> <b>pentagon</b> piece either horizontally or vertically; and related to this, the tendency of trying to fill up the notch of <b>the</b> <b>pentagon.</b> In one study participants were found to spend over 60% of their attempts on such misguided placements of <b>the</b> <b>pentagon</b> piece. And even when <b>the</b> <b>pentagon</b> piece happened to be placed properly, it was mostly not recognized {{as part of the}} solution, as a match with the T is not easily seen. The puzzle is easily solved when the insight is reached that <b>the</b> <b>pentagon</b> is part of both the horizontal and vertical stem of the T and that the notch in <b>the</b> <b>pentagon</b> constitutes an inside corner.|$|R
