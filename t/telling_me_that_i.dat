500|$|In April 2010, a feud arose {{between the}} {{producer}} and R singer Ginuwine, after Timbaland {{failed to make}} an appearance at the singer's music video shoot of [...] "Get Involved". Later in April, Timbaland released a new single featuring T-Pain and Billy Blue titled [...] "Talk That". In June 2010, when questioned by RWD magazine about the UK music scene he made the bold {{claim to be the}} inspiration for the dub-step music scene. [...] "The UK scene... they’re always <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> started it. You have Dub-bass...". When questioned further about it he went on to say: [...] "It’s funny cos they went back to some of my old music that really created that sound and just, instead of going fast, they went slow with more bass." [...] In August 2010, a [...] "possible suicide attempt" [...] APB was put out for Timbaland after his home was burgled. When his family were unable to contact him, they called 911 and a manhunt began. Police eventually found his car and brought him back home, where paramedics examined him, before declaring he was not a threat to himself. When questioned, Timbaland said he only took a drive to think about the burglary, as he thought the possible thief could have been someone close whom he trusted.|$|E

They were rabid [...] Like, old ladies saying, 'You better get it right." [...] She revealed that she was initially underwhelmed by a photo of Pattinson, but said of his audition, which was a love scene with co-star Kristen Stewart: [...] "It was electric. The room shorted out, the sky opened up, and I was like, 'This {{is going to be}} good.'" [...] Pattinson has admitted; [...] "I {{had no idea how to}} play the part when I went in, and it was a good thing to find during the audition. I really wanted it after that, but I didn’t really even know what it was. I hadn’t really read any of the books. And just from that, ‘I want this job.’ It was pretty much because of Kristen." [...] In early 2008, Pattinson spoke of a fan backlash against his casting, disclosing Entertainment Weekly that [...] "I stopped reading [...] after I saw the signatures saying 'Please, anyone else.'" [...] He revealed to the Evening Standard that; [...] "The books have a huge following, and I’ve already got bags of letters from angry fans, <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can’t possibly play Edward, because I’m Diggory. I hope I can prove them wrong." ...|$|E
