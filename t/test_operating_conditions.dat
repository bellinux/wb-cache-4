In {{the present}} work the {{definition}} of a test procedure for evaluating the formability of Mg alloy thin sheets was investigated taking into account both temperature and strain rate. A numerical-experimental approach was adopted by the authors: numerical simulations were run with the aim of: (i) defining the punch geometry of the formability test equipment {{in order to have a}} uniform, fast and constant temperature distribution on the specimen; (ii) setting the <b>test</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> in order to force the specimen failure in a region where temperature and strain can be easily acquired.

40|$|A {{transparent}} {{proton exchange}} membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) {{has been designed}} to enable visualisation of water droplets during its operation. Images of the formation of droplets {{on the surface of the}} gas diffusion layer (GDL) on its cathode side, which result in water accumulation and blockage to the airflow channels, were recorded using a CCD camera. Measurement of the cell current and droplet characterisation have been carried out simultaneously and the effect of the airflow and external resistive load has been quantified. The droplet images show that water accumulation occurs first in the middle channels of a serpentine reactant-flow fuel cell design and that no droplets are formed at the bends of the flow channels. Water blockage to the airflow path was caused by the overlapping of two land-touching droplets developing on each side of the channel. Flooding was found to be more susceptible to the airflow than the other <b>test</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|E

The refrigeration system must remove enough energy from the air to produce temperatures as low as- 30 F with test section airspeeds as high as 395 mph.

40|$|The {{ability to}} control the extent of laminar flow on swept wings at {{supersonic}} speeds may be a critical element in developing the enabling technology for a High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT). Laminar boundary layers are less resistive to forward flight than their turbulent counterparts, thus the farther downstream that transition from laminar to turbulent flow in the wing boundary layer is extended can be of significant economic impact. Due to the complex processes involved experimental studies of boundary layer stability and transition are needed, and these are performed in "quiet" wind tunnels capable of simulating the low-disturbance environment of free flight. At Ames, a wind tunnel has been built to operate at flow conditions which match those of the HSCT laminar flow flight demonstration 'aircraft, the F- 16 XL, i. e. at a Mach number of 1. 6 and a Reynolds number range of 1 to 3 million per foot. This will allow detailed studies of the attachment line and crossflow {{on the leading edge}} area of the highly swept wing. Also, use of suction as a means of control of transition due to crossflow and attachment line instabilities can be studied.

40|$|The {{decay of}} {{existing}} power plants is caused primarily by mechanical factors, human errors, environmental effects, control deviations, and defects in materials. These causes {{are reflected in}} performance malfunctions of the processes. In a highly integrated and complex energy system, {{it is difficult to}} detect and evaluate the origin of a malfunction. A diagnosis methodology for power generation systems which addresses this is presented here and illustrated by its application to the TADEUS problem (Valero et al., 2004, 2002 a). The proposed methodology is based on a comparison between two operating conditions, namely, the <b>test</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> (TOP), which reflect actual operating conditions, and the reference operating conditions (ROP), which can be based on simulated thermal balances or an acceptance test. Energy and exergy balances as well as analytical models are used to simulate plant performance at either TOP or ROP and these, along with data collection from the plant, characterize a complete database for the plant. Such a database includes variables which can be classified as either free (variations in their values are the cause of malfunctions) or dependent. A reconciliation-simulation algorithm corrects the values of the free variables for a given heat rate and total power to pre-malfunction values. In order to demonstrate the reliability of the approach, it is applied to the combined cycle power plant outlined in the TADEUS problem. It is shown that the results generated by this methodology provide relevant information of the present condition of the plant...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} for the commercialization of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is the limited lifetime due to degradation processes of the different fuel cell components. The investigation of the underlying degradation mechanisms and mitigation strategies for fuel cell operation and for material development are key factors for PEMFC research and development. This presentation is focused on reversible and irreversible degradation phenomena in PEMFCs. A new systematic approach {{for the analysis of}} reversible and irreversible degradation rates in an operating fuel cell will be introduced. A detailed description of voltage loss rates and particularly of the discrimination between reversible and irreversible voltage losses will be given. A major motivation of the presented work is the lack of common testing procedures and determination approaches of voltage losses in durability tests of fuel cell. This issue results in severe difficulties in the comparison of results obtained by different testing facilities. This is limiting factor for the development of fuel cell components because the results within different research projects cannot be correlated, especially if only one value for a degradation rate is reported, e. g. for defined current density and defined <b>test</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> In order to systematically analyze voltage losses durability measurements of several hundreds of hours were performed in PEMFC single cells and stacks. Specific test protocols containing regular refresh procedures were used for this purpose. This enables to distinguish between reversible and irreversible voltage losses. To test the refresh procedures and analyze their effect on cell performance, parameters such as the duration of e. g. a soak time step have been varied. Between these refresh steps the cells were typically operated for 50 to 150 h. For in-situ diagnostics of the operated cells performance curves, HFR (high frequency resistant) measurements, and CVs (cyclic voltammograms) were recorded {{in order to determine the}} impact of the refresh procedures on the cells...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} {{literature}} relevant for the understanding of chemical degradation in Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) systems was conducted. The proposed pathways {{to the formation of}} chemical species suspected of causing degradation were summarized. The structures of the most common PerFluorinated Sulfonic Acid (PFSA) ionomers were presented. The proposed mechanisms of chemical degradation were listed with reference to their point of attack on the ionomer structure. The role of Fluoride Emission Rate (FER) as a metric for chemical degradation rate was discussed. Several papers present results where fluorocarbon fragments are present in the effluent water. The quantification of these fragments was scarce, but results indicate that their amount may depend on fuel cell test hardware as well as the <b>test</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> A novel methodology for simultaneous analysis of fluorine and fluoride were presented. By alkaline fusion, the fluorocarbons were digested and fluorine completely recovered as fluoride. Fluoride concentrations were then estimated for both digested and untreated samples by means of potentiometric analysis. By application of a fluoride selective electrode in acidic media, improved sensitivity was obtained. The proposed methodology was evaluated statistically. Using PolyTetraFluoroEthylene (PTFE) as a model compound, excellent recovery of fluorine was documented. A review of papers presenting FER data was performed and the results were summarized with reference to the operating conditions testing were conducted. FER data span several decades in magnitude. A non-accelerated durability experiment was conducted to evaluate both FER as well as total Fluorine Emission Rates (FtER) throughout the experiment. Cathode and anode effluents were scrubbed in sodium hydroxide gas bubblers. In addition, a fluoride selective electrode was mounted in an anode gas bubbler in order to continuously monitor the accumulated fluoride concentration. The results show that the FtER to FER ratio is significantly higher than one. For the cathode FtER was initially high and decreasing with time. Cathodic FER was increasing although less pronounced than the FtER decrease. As a result adecreasing FtER to FER ration was found. At the anode, a correlation between onlineFER and the FER found from batch analysis was found; both increasing with time. Cathodic FtER and FER were always higher than their anode equivalent. Nocorrelation with fuel cell performance data was found. The results showed that for thenon-accelerated test protocol applied, significant amounts of fluorocarbons leaves thefuel cell. Further, the ratio of FtER to FER also changed with time, suggesting that theFER metric does not represent a constant fraction of the ionomer loss throughout theexperiment. An accelerated durability experiment was conducted in order to evaluate FER as a function of gas flow rates at Open Circuit Voltage. It was found that a five-fold increase in gas flow rates resulted in FER that was more than five times higher. It was speculated that the increase in FER was caused by increased gas cross-over. For both gas flow levels, FER was sharply decreasing with time. Performance losses were higher for high gas flow rates, although a direct correlation between performance data and FER could not be obtained. Experimental design was applied in order to evaluate several operational parameters and their impact on fuel cell performance and durability. An ON/OFF accelerated protocol was applied. Gas humidification level, clamping pressure and pressurized operation were used as input parameters. It was found that 100 % humidified reactant gases and pressurized operation gave superior performance and durability. FER was lower for high humidification, but higher for pressurized operation. In other words, the lowest FER was not found for the experiment showing superior durability. Interestingly, similar FER was recorded for repeated experiments where carbon flow fields were replaced with stainless steel ones. SER was found to be much higher than FER. As the ionomer structure suggests SER to be significantly lower than FER, it was believe that the ionomer was not the only source of sulfur. Sulfur levels were initially high, and highest for experiments with 100 % humidified gases. After an initial decay, SER nevertheless stabilized at a higher level than FER. It was not understood why the assumed contamination of sulfur did not wash out with time. An attempt to evaluate the background levels of fluoride and sulfate in the fuel cell test rig was attempted. It was found that significant levels of both were present at the test startup. Purging with inert gas did however reduce the fluoride and sulfate levels to acceptable levels after a few hours. It was also shown that Gas Diffusion Layers (GDL) was a possible source of fluoride and sulfur in the system PhD i kjemiPhD in Chemistr...|$|E

This investigation of friction models is motivated by {{the fact that there is}} little consensus in the literature on how best to model friction for dynamic friction compensation. the control strategies are compared in an extensive test program involving sinusoidal position trajectory tracking experiments on a direct-drive dc motor. We focus attention on comparative experimental results of friction compensation especially with repeated velocity reversals. The results show that the adaptive experiments also yield insight into the appropriateness of the different friction models under the <b>tested</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> In particular, the Dahl model, typically ignored in the literature proves to be significant for the firction-compensating control problem with repeated zero- velocity crossings...|$|R
