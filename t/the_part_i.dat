500|$|In Japanese animations, Sasuke is {{voiced by}} Noriaki Sugiyama. At the {{beginning}} of <b>the</b> <b>Part</b> <b>I</b> anime, Sugiyama {{found it difficult to}} voice Sasuke because he did not know much about his personality.

500|$|In Sherrybaby, Gyllenhaal {{played a}} young drug-addicted thief {{trying to put}} her life in order after prison so she can {{reconcile}} with her daughter. During promotion of the film, she noted of her portrayal of the character: [...] "I think she's in such dire straights [...] that all she has are these kind of naive, fierce hope. And while I was playing <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>I</b> was looking for pleasure and hope in everything, even in these really bleak things.

[...] Her performance in the film was well received: David Germain of the Associated Press wrote, [...] "Gyllenhaal humanizes her so deeply and richly... that Sherry elicits sympathy even in her darkest and weakest moments", and Dennis Harvey of Variety called her performance [...] "naturalistic".

She utilizes case studies including Patty Hearst, the Manson Family, {{and the mass}} murder/suicide of members of Peoples Temple at Jonestown to illustrate the neurology she explains in Part II, [...] "The traitor in your skull". In {{the case of the}} Manson Family followers of Charles Manson carried out multiple murders in 1969, and with Peoples Temple over 900 followers of charismatic leader Jim Jones died in 1978 in Jonestown, Guyana after consuming cyanide. Taylor asserts that the techniques used by cults to influence others are similar to those used by other social groups, and compares similar totalitarian aspects of cults and communist societies. These techniques include isolating the individual and controlling their access to information, challenging their belief structure and creating doubt, and repeating messages in a pressurized environment.|$|E

Walsh recalled meeting and discovering Murphy: [...] "There was something about him– he was incredibly enigmatic and he would walk into a room with real presence and you'd go, [...] "My God". It {{had nothing to do with}} those bloody eyes that everyone's going on about all the time." [...] Murphy observed, [...] "I was unbelievably cocky and had nothing to lose, and it suited <b>the</b> <b>part,</b> <b>I</b> suppose." [...] Originally intended to run for three weeks in Cork, Disco Pigs ended up touring throughout Europe, Canada and Australia for two years, and Murphy left both university and his band. Though he had intended to go back to playing music, he secured representation after his first agent caught a performance of Disco Pigs, and his acting career began to take off.|$|E

[...] "Lear casually asked if I'd be interested in <b>the</b> <b>part.</b> <b>I</b> said yes, but knew {{it was out of}} the question, because in real life things don't happen that way. Nobody walks in and gets on a Norman Lear show. I read for the part, got it and didn't sleep at all that night." [...] Linda Gray was somewhat non-plussed upon being offered the role of transgender Linda Murkland. [...] "I remember meeting Norman and him saying, 'You'll be perfect for the role.' I didn't know whether to take that as a compliment or what." [...] To prepare for her role, Linda Gray asked Lear to arrange for her to meet with a transgender woman. Gray met with her for several hours prior to the beginning of filming and on a couple of occasions during production. Lois Nettleton reportedly based her characterization of Christina Stockwood on Clark Gable. Production started in early March 1977 with director Herbert Kenwith.|$|E

500|$|Handel's {{music for}} Messiah [...] is {{distinguished}} {{from most of}} his other oratorios by an orchestral restraint—a quality which the musicologist Percy M. Young observes was not adopted by Mozart and other later arrangers of the music. The work begins quietly, with instrumental and solo movements preceding the first appearance of the chorus, whose entry in the low alto register is muted. A particular aspect of Handel's restraint is his limited use of trumpets throughout the work. After their introduction in <b>the</b> <b>Part</b> <b>I</b> chorus [...] "Glory to God", apart from the solo in [...] "The trumpet shall sound" [...] they are heard only in [...] "Hallelujah" [...] and the final chorus [...] "Worthy is the Lamb". It is this rarity, says Young, that makes these brass interpolations particularly effective: [...] "Increase them and the thrill is diminished". In [...] "Glory to God", Handel marked the entry of the trumpets as da lontano e un poco piano, meaning [...] "quietly, from afar"; his original intention had been to place the brass offstage (in disparte) at this point, to highlight the effect of distance. [...] In this initial appearance the trumpets lack the expected drum accompaniment, [...] "a deliberate withholding of effect, leaving something in reserve for Parts II and III" [...] according to Luckett.|$|E
