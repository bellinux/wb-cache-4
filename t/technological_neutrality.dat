The Court rejected SOCAN's argument that this factor should be assessed based on the aggregate amount of previews, rather than the amount of each preview in relation to the whole work. Given the ease and magnitude with which digital works are disseminated over the Internet, focusing on the aggregate amount of the dealing in cases involving digital works would lead to disproportionate findings of unfairness when compared with non-digital works.

40|$|<b>Technological</b> <b>neutrality</b> in law is, roughly, {{the idea}} that law should not pick {{technological}} winners and losers, that law should neither help nor hinder particular types of technological artefacts. It has become a pervasive idea in technology law and politics in the West and now forces itself upon the World Trade Organization {{as a means of}} preventing China from regulating its territorial Internet. This paper examines the idea of <b>technological</b> <b>neutrality</b> for both its internal coherence and its relationship with the dominant politico-philosophical traditions of our time – the liberal and the Confucian. In doing so, the paper points at how liberalism itself has been transformed in contemporary societies, the role that information and communication technologies play in this transformation and shows how <b>technological</b> <b>neutrality</b> threatens {{at the same time the}} developments of contemporary liberalism and liberalism’s reconciliation with the Confucian value system. The paper invites us to question <b>technological</b> <b>neutrality</b> through its relations with political neutrality, a doctrine that has lost significant grounds in contemporary liberal philosophy post-communitarian critique and which is fundamentally opposed to the ethico-political traditions of Chinese societies. On an applied level, the paper invites us to abandon ideas of neutrality in technology law and politics in general and, in particular, provides a hopefully compelling argument for China to resist attempts to neutralize its value-system and nation-building project through the system of international trade. postprin...|$|E

40|$|In {{the realm}} of law, {{neutrality}} is widely hailed as a fundamental principle of fairness, justice and equity; it is also, however, widely criticized as a myth that too often obscures the inevitable reality of perspective, interest or agenda. The principle of <b>technological</b> <b>neutrality,</b> recently articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada when applying copyright law to online activities, seems similarly fundamental in the copyright realm — and equally mythical. In what is now dubbed the Supreme Court’s “Copyright Pentalogy” — five copyright judgments released concurrently by the Court in June 2012 — the unprecedented importance accorded by the Court {{to the principle of}} <b>technological</b> <b>neutrality</b> is clear; what remains unclear is precisely what “technological neutrality” means, why it matters, and whether or how it can (or should) ever be attained. This chapter considers the significance of the principle and its potential to guide the future development of copyright law and policy in Canada.

40|$|This thesis {{defends the}} {{importance}} of a standardized designation for the principle of <b>technological</b> <b>neutrality</b> pertaining to the Next-Generation Network (NGN) migration within a competition regime. Renaming this as the principle of techno-economic neutrality would clearly demarcate its role as promoter of inter-technological competition as well as justify the necessity of grouping the three regulatory principles of <b>technological</b> <b>neutrality,</b> competition neutrality, and network neutrality followed by their integration into the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Reference Paper. The first part introduces the theoretical foundations to better define what it is and what it is not; the principle of techno-economic neutrality supports neither a total state non-intervention nor a progress reduced to a technical progress. The second part describes the parameters of the unanimous definition of the regulatory principle of techno-economic neutrality for the information and communication sectors considering competition and convergence. The triplets of neutrality would offer two guaranties: a regulatory burden balanced between the different suppliers of substitutable services and the emergence of an information and communication society protective of democratic values.

Strong users’ rights foster expression, enhance learning opportunities, and make creation possible in the first place. With respect to specific reforms, Digital Rights Management must not prohibit anti-circumvention for non-infringing purposes, licensing regimes must be accountable and transparent, and copyright protection generally should be subject to a flexible and broad fair dealing test by the inclusion of a ―such as‖ clause in the current fair dealing provision of the Copyright Act, as guided by the Supreme Court‘s test in CCH v.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the law of the World Trade Organization (WTO) relevant to telecommunications services and correlates this body of law with the current regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services in the European Community. The latter has been adapted {{to meet the challenges of}} technological and market developments in communications, epitomized by the processes of digitization, enhanced transport networks and convergence. The novel solutions embodied in the EC electronic communications regime, notably, a new design of the Significant Market Power mechanism, a projected withdrawal of sector specific regulation and an affirmation of the principle of <b>technological</b> <b>neutrality,</b> pose interesting questions as to the conformity of this reformed EC communications law with the WTO rules on telecommunications services and the obligations of the European Communities and their Member States.

40|$|A {{challenge}} facing reformers {{in the field}} of communications law is the increasingly widening gap between converging markets and services, and regulatory frameworks that continue to govern {{on the basis of a}} rigid vertical distinction between broadcasting and telecommunications. In Australia, media and communications are governed by the two distinct and largely independent statutory regimes created by the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth) and the Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth). However, markets and services and the underlying technologies have converged. In such a context, continuing to apply vertical 'silo' laws serves to undermine established regulatory objectives of parity and <b>technological</b> <b>neutrality.</b> In 2011, the federal government announced a review of the effects of convergence. One of the issues identified in the review was to need to consider shifting from a silo model to a horizontal 'layered' model. The purpose of the present article is to analyse the merits of adopting a horizontal layered model (i. e. one which mirrors the horizontal layered architecture of modern electronic communications) as the basis for the design of an effective regulatory framework for electronic communications in Australia. 13 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{development}} of the Internet {{has led to a}} growing electronic cross-border delivery of services. While the WTO negotiations have not caught up to the reality of such service trade, the first GATS case dealing with the Internet, namely United States Measures Affecting the Cross-Border Supply of Gambling and Betting Services, has advanced matters. This paper distils the substantive conclusions of the case and remaining questions in relation to Internet-supplied services and certain core concepts of the GATS. Moreover, it sheds light on the case s implications for the services negotiations under the ongoing Doha Development Agenda. It concludes that the second ever GATS case has provided an encouraging set of answers to the unresolved questions of the WTO s Work Programme on E-Commerce, mainly confirming the applicability of GATS commitments to electronically supplied services and shaping the concept of <b>technological</b> <b>neutrality.</b> While more work or dispute settlement cases are necessary to clarify the remaining questions, the rulings have {{paved the way for the}} GATS to be a more effective discipline for cross-border (electronic) trade.

40|$|Market-based {{methods of}} {{spectrum}} management {{can be applied}} both at the primary stage of issuing spectrum licences, via auctions, and by introducing a regime of secondary trading of spectrum licences, thereby permitting both change in ownership of the licence and a choice {{on the part of}} the licensee over what technology to employ (<b>technological</b> <b>neutrality)</b> and what to produce (service neutrality). Moreover, the use of market methods need not be confined to spectrum used for commercial purposes.

Both the European Union and individual member states are increasingly interested in applying market methods of spectrum management. The European Commission has put forward legislative proposals, which, if adopted, would create bands that were subject to trading and flexibility of use over the 27 member states. In one member state, the United Kingdom, a new regime of spectrum management has been designed and is being implemented involving predominant reliance on spectrum markets, an extensive programme of spectrum awards, the development of a new method of specifying spectrum user rights to permit change of use and the integration of commercial and public sector spectrum markets.

Fourth Amendment scholars have repeatedly attacked the rule {{on the ground that}} it is unpersuasive on its face and gives the government too much power This Article responds that critics have overlooked the benefits of the rule and have overstated its weaknesses. The third-party doctrine serves two critical functions. First, the doctrine ensures the <b>technological</b> <b>neutrality</b> of the Fourth Amendment. It corrects for the substitution effect of third parties that would otherwise allow savvy criminals to substitute a hidden third-party exchange for a previously public act. Second, the doctrine helps ensure the clarity of Fourth Amendment rules.

Finally, the two primary criticisms of the third-party doctrine are significantly weaker than critics have claimed. The third-party doctrine is awkward for reasons of form rather than function; it is a consent rule disguised as an application of Katz 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 reasonable expectation of privacy 2 ̆ 2 test.

40|$|In September 2016, the European Commission {{presented}} legislative {{proposals to}} replace the European Regulatory Framework for Electronic Communications (RFEC) with a new European Electronic Communications Code. Among the many stated objectives was to stimulate more rapid investment in fast and ultra-fast broadband. One can argue that the RFEC {{was put in place}} in 2002, at a time when networks were not yet liberalised or privatised, and when investment needs of existing copper networks were fairly consistent and predictable. As a consequence, the RFEC put great emphasis on achieving competition, relatively little on achieving investment. This reflects to some extent a preference for optimisation of static efficiency over dynamic efficiency, which was perhaps in order given that the former is far easier to analyse than the latter. In this paper, we review the regulatory instruments that provided in the European Code, and consider based on the economic literature, publicly available statistics, and our own analysis {{the degree to which the}} Action Lines in the proposed European Code are likely (individually or collectively) to contribute to increased investment in fast broadband in practice. Our assessment is that the proposed enhancements to broadband policy in the proposed European Code are broadly in the right direction, and collectively are likely to offer network operators a more profitable and predictable business case for investment in high speed broadband. Notwithstanding our observations that the case for FTTP/FTTP can often be significantly overblown, we would still say that this is a welcome or overdue change. The risks implied by insufficient specification of these provisions in the European Code, and the lack of clarity as regards <b>technological</b> <b>neutrality,</b> are however significant. We would hope that these provisions can be sharpened in the course of the legislative process...|$|E
