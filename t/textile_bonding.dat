40|$|Smart {{textiles}} are {{an expanding}} field with much potential and arouse {{interest in the}} R&D sphere and industry. These find vast applications in engineering, healthcare and fashion, and contribute additional functionality and intelligence to structures. Quiet often the intelligence of such smart structures is supported by electronics that ensure functions such as data transfer and analysis for monitoring systems. Moreover, many smart textile systems require also energy source. At present, {{there is a great}} variety of scenarios to implement the joining of the functional textile compounds and electronics. Nevertheless, the joining technology is one the key challenges for smart textile developers, especially regarding wearable applications. Smart luminous textiles are of great interest for applications such as clothing and interior design and visual merchandizing. Moreover, luminous textiles are beneficial for protective clothing and sportswear in order to insure better visibility of the wear and interactive design for non-verbal communication. Additionally, luminous textiles have potentials for healthcare and medicine applications such as phototherapy. At present, such smart textiles are mostly limited to LED integration. Despite well-developed techniques for LED attachment onto textiles, power sourcing and controlling of the electronics for more complex LED matrixes remains a field for technology improvement. Moreover, OLED technology is more preferable for some applications due to fragility of more sophisticated and large-scale LED matrixes. This study presents a preliminary study for reversible joining of textiles and electronics within a novel concept for electroluminescence (EL) towards Organic Light Emitting Devices (OLED) implementations by printing technology. Technical embroidery is suggested as a promising technology that ensures continuous manufacturing of the functional textile compounds, electro-conductive paths and the joining platforms for electronic interconnections with active textiles. A novel concept for EL is developed in order to continuously implement the functional textile elements and ensure an efficient solution for the smart <b>textile</b> <b>bonding</b> with electronics. Regarding specifics of the development usage conditions, solutions for reversible joining are in the focus of the study. Finally, a concept of the bonding module for the electro-conductive platforms is described to be applied to custom developed EL structures on textiles...|$|E

5000|$|When nanoengineered {{coatings}} {{are applied}} to fabrics, the nanoparticles readily form bonds with the fibers of the material. The high surface area relative to the volume of particles increases their chemical reactivity, allowing them to stick to materials more permanently. Fabrics treated with nanoparticle coatings during manufacturing produce materials that kill bacteria, eliminate moisture and odor, and prevent static electricity. Polymer nanofiber coatings applied to <b>textiles</b> <b>bond</b> to the material {{at one end of}} the polymer, forming a surface of tiny, hair-like structures. [...] The polymer [...] "hairs" [...] create a thin layer that prevents liquids from making contact with the actual fabric. Nanofabrics with dirt-proof, stain-proof, and superhydrophobic properties are possible as a result of the layer formed by polymer nanofibers.|$|R
40|$|Fibre Reinforced Cementitious Matrix (FRCM) {{composites}} are {{now widely}} used for repair and retrofitting existing structures. Guidelines for product qualification {{are needed to}} characterize the strengthening systems before they are made available {{in the market and}} installed. The paper proposes a procedure that combines the results of direct tensile and shear bond tests to provide engineering design parameters for externally bonded FRCM reinforcements. Due to the possible occurrence of different failure modes, the procedure provides results on the base of the weakest mechanism that takes place. Thanks to its simplicity, the proposed method is suitable for standard product qualification and material assurance purposes. In order to investigate its feasibility, the qualification procedure is applied to different reinforcements comprising basalt, carbon, glass, and steel <b>textiles,</b> <b>bonded</b> with either cement or lime mortars to clay bricks and tuff units...|$|R

The need for consumer protection, coupled with the new regulations and environmental concerns, increases the interest in flame-retardant treatments, in particular intumescent systems. The aim of this work was to develop innovative synthetic <b>textiles,</b> <b>bonded</b> with flame-retardant back-coating at laboratory scale, {{and to develop a}} methodology to study the fire behavior of these kinds of materials. Our work points out the differences in fire behavior of polypropylene textile structures in comparison with plastics. Fire behavior was validated on cone calorimeter equipment. As a consequence, this study shows how after reducing the rate of heat release, {{which is one of the}} parameters of the new regulations, polypropylene fibers can be used for flame retardant materials...|$|R
40|$|Structural lattice models {{incorporating}} trusses and beams {{are frequently}} used to mechanically model fibrous materials, {{because they can}} capture (local) mesoscale phenomena. Physically relevant lattice computations are however computationally expensive. A suitable multiscale approach to reduce the computational cost of large-scale lattice computations is the quasicontinuum (QC) method. This method resolves local mesoscale phenomena in regions of interest and coarse grains elsewhere, using only the lattice model. In previous work, a virtual-power-based QC framework is proposed for lattice models that include local dissipative mechanisms. In this paper, the virtual-power-based QC method is adopted for lattice models in which bond failure and subsequent frictional fiber sliding are incorporated - which are of significant importance for fibrous materials such as paper, cardboard, textile and electronic <b>textile.</b> <b>Bond</b> failure and fiber sliding are nonlocal dissipative mechanisms {{and to deal with}} this nonlocality, the virtual-power-based QC method is equipped with a mixed formulation in which the kinematic variables as well as the internal history variables are interpolated. Previously defined summation rules can still be used to sample the governing equations in this QC framework. Illustrative examples are presented. © 2013...|$|R

To take responsibility for the environment means to develop resource- and production efficient technologies for the future. For this very reason and in conjunction with their positive characteristics there has been a great demand for lightweight structures in the automobile industry and aircraft construction. For hybrid lightweight constructions (HLWC) materials such as metal, plastics or <b>textiles</b> are <b>bonded</b> together to achieve a significant weight reduction whilst providing a great amount of stability and structural strength. The ecological and economic manufacturing of HLWC is also a very important aspect for a sustainable development.

The efforts on behalf of HLWC are worthwhile: high use phase energy savings and reduction of CO 2 emissions...|$|R

40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) and Fiber Reinforced Cementitious Matrix (FRCM) {{systems have}} emerged as attractive technologies for the external strengthening of RC structures. The use of steel <b>textiles,</b> externally <b>bonded</b> to the substrate via wet lay-up, represents an innovative and alternative solution to the application of carbon and glass sheets. Furthermore, the use of inorganic matrices could be useful to overcome the problems of fire endurance or meet the preservation criteria required for applications to architectural heritage. Within their mechanical response several aspects still need a deeper examination. Among them, the steel FRP/FRCM-to-concrete shear bond behaviour is the crucial one for the effectiveness of most applications since it represents the means of stress transfer between concrete and the composite materials. This paper helps to fill these gaps by summarizing the main results of a wide experimental program performed on the steel FRP/FRCM systems bonded to concrete members.

30|$|In the {{footwear}} industry, {{the most}} important method for joining materials is adhesive bonding. In 1906 nitrocellulose adhesives were introduced, being replaced in 1949 by polychloroprene adhesives (PCP), which due to their versatility present good results in leather <b>bonding,</b> <b>textiles</b> and other materials. In 1970 the PU adhesives are then introduced in the footwear industry. Subsequently adhesives based on styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS), styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), latex, aqueous dispersions and hotmelts were used [4]. However, for the bonding of upper/soles, adhesives used are based on PCP and PU. This work discusses the PU solvent-based adhesives because {{they are able to}} bond various types of materials, regarding the application upper/soles [5].|$|R

40|$|Report on the {{permanent}} hydrophobizing of polyamide fabrics, {{carried out at}} the Thuringian Institute for Textile and Plastics Research. Best results have been obtained when using fluoropolymers. However, severe problems may arise with fluoropolymer finishing in view of ecologic aspects. Searching for environmental harmless hydrophobizing agents resulted in mono- 2 -oxazolines with long-chain fatty acid residues, and epoxy-terminated polysiloxanes. These finishing agents can be applicated from organic solutions and can be fixed by thermal treatment. The finished fabrics mainly retain breathing and <b>textile</b> properties.

40|$|Cone snails are {{gastropod}} mollusks of {{the genus}} Conus that live in tropical marine habitats. They are predators that paralyze their prey by injection of venom containing a plethora of small, conformationally constrained peptides (conotoxins). We report the identification, characterization, and structure of a gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing peptide, conotoxin epsilon-TxIX, isolated from the venom of the molluscivorous cone snail, Conus <b>textile.</b> The disulfide <b>bonding</b> pattern of the four cysteine residues, an unparalleled degree of posttranslational processing including bromination, hydroxylation, and glycosylation define a family of conotoxins that may target presynaptic Ca 2 + channels or act on G protein-coupled presynaptic receptors via another mechanism. This conotoxin selectively reduces neurotransmitter release at an Aplysia cholinergic synapse by reducing the presynaptic influx of Ca 2 + in a slow and reversible fashion. The three-dimensional structure, determined by two-dimensional 1 H NMR spectroscopy, identifies an electronegative patch created by the side chains of two gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues that extend outward from a cavernous cleft.

40|$|Mechanical {{response}} of textile-reinforced aerated concrete sandwich panels was investigated using an instrumented three-point bending experiment under static and low-velocity dynamic loading. Two types of aerated concrete: {{autoclaved aerated concrete}} (AAC) and polymeric Fiber-Reinforced Aerated Concrete (FRAC) were used as the core material. Skin layer consisted of two layers of Alkali Resistant Glass (ARG) textiles and a cementitious binder. Performance of ductile skin-brittle core (TRC-AAC) and ductile skin-ductile core (TRC-FRAC) composites was evaluated in terms of flexural stiffness, strength, and energy absorption capacity. The effect of impact energy on the mechanical properties was measured at various drop heights on two different cross-sections using energy levels up to 40 J and intermediate strain rates up to 20 s(- 1). The externally <b>bonded</b> <b>textile</b> layers significantly improved the mechanical properties of light-weight low-strength aerated concrete core under both loading modes. Dynamic flexural strength was greater than the static flexural strength {{by as much as}} 4 times. For specimens with larger cross-sections, unreinforced-autoclaved AAC core had a 15 % higher apparent flexural capacity.

40|$|Textile {{reinforced}} concrete (TRC) is an innovative {{high performance composite}} material consisting of open multi-axial textiles embedded in a fine-grained concrete matrix. Despite the fact that TRC-based research has revealed many promising attributes, {{it has yet to}} reach its recognition {{due to a lack of}} available design tools, standards and long-term behaviour. To be able to reach this next stage, consistent test methods and reliable models need to be established to reduce uncertainty and the need for individual and extensive experimental studies. This thesis aims to investigate structural performance, durability and sustainability aspects of TRC for its usability in the built environment. The structural performance was experimentally and analytically evaluated for the individual material constituents, material interaction, as well as global TRC components. The linking of the structural performance of these various levels was investigated by means of non-linear finite element analysis (FEA). The durability of TRC was characterized according to the influence of accelerated ageing based on alkali resistance on the structural performance of textile reinforcement. Furthermore, the environmental sustainability of TRC was evaluated in comparison to conventional RC using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The experimental quantification of the structural performance on the material and interaction levels was found to be decisive to understand the composite behaviour. In general, the bond behaviour in TRC has been identified as a critical feature affecting the global behaviour. Particularly for carbon <b>textiles,</b> the <b>bond</b> behaviour needs to be improved; an enhancement of the load bearing behaviour was successfully observed using surface coatings, short fibres, and high performance concrete. Linking the experimental data from the material and interaction levels to the global level in FEA led to promising results such that further insight on the actual failure behaviour could be gained. The accelerated testing was generally too aggressive for textiles made of basalt and AR-glass leading to extensive degradation; however, carbon textiles were found to be a promising alternative as they have superior durability properties in an alkaline environment without undergoing any strength loss. Through accelerated testing, it was found that the exposure time, temperature and test solution need to be material specific. The applied sizing or coating on the textiles also had a considerable influence on the extent of degradation. Based on the conducted LCA, the reduction of the concrete cover in a TRC panel significantly decreased its environmental impact compared to traditionally reinforced solutions. Ultimately, the experimental and modelling approaches developed in this work can be applied to further characterize the short- and long-term behaviour of TRC for the built environment...|$|R
