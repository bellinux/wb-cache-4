The lecture was given to the first group using a computer presentation program which uses multimedia treated as an experimental group, while the second group was given the same lecture using the traditional method which uses the dialog & discussion technique treated as a control group.

By hybrid systems, we mean an input-output operator relating hybrid signals, that is, signals which consist of two parts: a continuous-time part and a discrete-time part. We first introduce the hybrid state-space model and show the closedness properties under the fundamental operations. We next investigate the standard basic issues associated with this formalism: reachability, observability, and internal stability. We define the notion of H 2 -norm of the hybrid system and show how to evaluate it.
