2500|$|More , {{a school}} of [...] "neo-Malthusian" [...] {{scholars}} has begun to link population and economics to a <b>third</b> <b>variable,</b> political change and political violence, and {{to show how the}} variables interact. In the early 1980s, Jack Goldstone linked population variables to the English Revolution of 1640–1660 and David Lempert devised a model of demographics, economics, and political change in the multi-ethnic country of Mauritius. Goldstone has since modeled other revolutions by looking at demographics and economics and Lempert has explained Stalin's purges and the Russian Revolution of 1917 in terms of demographic factors that drive political economy. Ted Robert Gurr has also modeled political violence, such as in the Palestinian territories and in Rwanda/Congo (two of the world's regions of most rapidly growing population) using similar variables in several comparative cases. These approaches suggest that political ideology follows demographic forces.|$|E
2500|$|Regardless of the {{validity}} of, or benefit of, belief in free will, it may be beneficial to understand where the idea comes from. [...] One contribution is randomness. [...] While it is established that that randomness {{is not the only}} factor in the perception of the free will, {{it has been shown that}} randomness can be mistaken as free will due to its indeterminacy.

It has been demonstrated that people’s belief in free will increases if presented with a simple level of choice. The specificity of the amount of choice is important, as too little or too great a degree of choice may negatively influence belief.

50|$|In {{statistics}} and regression analysis, moderation {{occurs when the}} relationship between two variables depends on a <b>third</b> <b>variable.</b> The <b>third</b> <b>variable</b> {{is referred to as}} the moderator variable or simply the moderator. The effect of a moderating variable is characterized statistically as an interaction; that is, a categorical (e.g., sex, ethnicity, class) or quantitative (e.g., level of reward) variable that affects the direction and/or strength of the relation between dependent and independent variables. Specifically within a correlational analysis framework, a moderator is a <b>third</b> <b>variable</b> that affects the zero-order correlation between two other variables, or the value of the slope of the dependent variable on the independent variable. In analysis of variance (ANOVA) terms, a basic moderator effect can be represented as an interaction between a focal independent variable and a factor that specifies the appropriate conditions for its operation.|$|E

40|$|Background Childhood internalizing {{and externalizing}} {{problems}} are closely related and often co-occur. Directional models have been employed to test how these problems are related, while few studies have tested a <b>third</b> <b>variables</b> model. Objective This study investigates whether {{internalizing and externalizing}} problems are reciprocally or unidirectionally related, whether these relations {{can be explained by}} <b>third</b> <b>variables,</b> and how these relations are associated with onset and stability. Methods A community sample of 1, 434 children aged 5. 08 (SD = 1. 25) and their mothers participated in two 1 -year interval data waves. Internalizing and externalizing problems were examined with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Results Using latent cross-lagged modeling, externalizing problems were found not be related to subsequent internalizing problems, or vice versa. These results were also found when controlling for inadequate parenting, parenting stress, maternal health and social preference. When taking problem level into account, externalizing problems were related to stability of clinical level internalizing problems, even when controlling for <b>third</b> <b>variables</b> inadequate parenting, parenting stress, maternal mental health and social preference. Conclusions Strong autoregressive paths for internalizing and externalizing problems were found. Internalizing and externalizing problems do not seem to influence each other over time in the community sample. When investigating relations among internalizing and externalizing problems, it seems to be important to take problem level into account...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{argues for}} {{enhanced}} consideration of <b>third</b> <b>variables</b> in interactivity re-search and proposes a “mediated moderation ” model to bring increased sophistica-tion {{to bear on}} the study of information technology effects. Interactivity, a central phenomenon in new media research, is an elusive concept that has enduringly in-trigued and confused scholars. Extant conceptualizations have produced incomplete causal models and have generally ignored the effect of <b>third</b> <b>variables.</b> We conceptu-alize interactivity as technological attributes of mediated environments that enable reciprocal communication or information exchange, which afford interaction be-tween communication technology and users, or between users through technology. Specifying roles for mediator and moderator variables, this paper proposes a model that incorporates interactive attributes, user perceptions (mediators such as perceived interactivity), individual differences (moderators such as Internet self-efficacy), and media effects measures to systematically examine the definition, process, and conse-quences of interactivity on users. Lastly, statistical procedures for testing mediated moderation are described...|$|R
40|$|To {{extend the}} {{research}} on self-monitoring and romantic relationships, we explored the connection between self-monitoring and romantic jealousy using a between-subjects design. We hypothesized high self-monitors (like men) would find sexual infidelity more distressing than emotional infidelity, whereas low self-monitors (like women) would find emotional infidelity more distressing than sexual infidelity. Participants completed the 25 -item Self-Monitoring Scale (Snyder, 1974) and 6 hypothetical infidelity scenarios (Buss et al., 1999).

That is, these reliable differences in self-monitoring reflected more or less distress by emotional infidelity.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a closer view on the {{interaction}} of exchange rate volatility and interest rate volatility in the Mercosur countries. We discuss several models that explain systematic correlations between the movements of both variables and their second statistical moments, i. e. their volatilities. In contrast to the “fear of floating” argument that could lead to a volatility trade-off, we argue that both variables are largely driven either by the credibility of a country or by politics in general and thus should move in the same direction. Subsequently, we test this hypothesis of a positive correlation between both variables empirically. As a final step, we control for the impact of <b>third</b> <b>variables</b> such as exchange rate misalignment, financial stress, and monetary volatility. Our results show that – independent from <b>third</b> <b>variables</b> –there is a notable co-movement of exchange rates and interest rates in Mercosur countries. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{use of the}} {{independent}} contrast method in comparative tests is studied. It is assumed that: (i) the traits under investigation are subject to natural selection; (ii) closely related species are similar because they share many characteristics of their niche, inherited from a common ancestor; and (iii) the current adaptive significance of the traits {{is the focus of}} investigation. The main objection to the use of species values in this case is that <b>third</b> <b>variables</b> which are shared by closely related species confound the relationship between the focal traits. In this paper, I argue that <b>third</b> <b>variables</b> are largely not controlled by the contrast methods, which are designed to estimate correlated evolution. To the extent that <b>third</b> <b>variables</b> also show correlated evolution, the true relationship among the traits of interest will remain obscured. Although {{the independent}} contrast method does not resolve the influence of third traits it does, in principle, provide a greater resolution than the use of the species mean values. However, its validity depends on the applicability of an evolutionary model which has a substantial stochastic component. To illustrate the consequences of relaxing this assumption I consider an alternative model of an adaptive radiation, where species come to fill a fixed niche space. Under this model, the expected value for the contrast correlation differs from that for the species correlation. The two correlations differ because contrasts reflect the historical pattern of diversification among species, whereas the species values describe the present-day relationships among the species. If the latter is of interest, I suggest that assessing significance based on the species correlations can be justified, providing that attention is paid to the role of potentially confounding third traits. Often, differences between contrast and species correlations may be biologically informative, reflecting changes in correlations between traits as an adaptive radiation proceeds; contrasts may be particularly useful as a means of investigating past history, rather than current utility of traits...|$|R
