25|$|The Court overrules him, {{stating that}} more torture {{should be applied}} until the truth is spoken. Again, Filippo changes his mind and {{supports}} the Court's decision. Agnese pleads with Filppo for Beatrice and Orombello, confessing her own behaviour in defaming them. The couple is led away, with Filippo and Agnese, full of remorse, left alone. She realises that <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> much further than she had expected and begs Filippo to drop all the charges. However, not wishing to look weak, he dismisses the idea and orders her to leave.|$|E
500|$|During the 2010–11 season, the Capitals {{participated in}} the 2011 NHL Winter Classic against the Pittsburgh Penguins at Heinz Field, Pittsburgh. Leading up to the game, both teams were {{featured}} on HBO's 24/7, which offered a behind-the-scenes look at both teams as they prepared. Laich refused to blame {{the presence of the}} cameras for the team's losing streak, saying, [...] "There's no using the HBO cameras as a crutch or an annoyance or anything like that. There's no excuse. I don't think HBO has played any bit of an ounce in how <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> the last two weeks." [...] Laich was appreciative of the opportunities afforded by the outdoor game, and was happy to be able to share time with his family and friends on the outdoor rink set up at Heinz Field.|$|E
500|$|Myrie-Williams joined League Two side Port Vale on loan on 24 November, {{joining the}} club until January 2012. A day later, on 25 November, {{he made his}} debut for Port Vale in a 0–0 home draw against Torquay United, playing the whole match. During the game, he {{impressed}} manager Micky Adams— [...] "He (Myrie-Williams) lifted me, as I'm asking people to be positive and show character, because the fans are disappointed with the way <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> recently, {{and we need to}} give them something to shout about, which I believe he did. I thought he was outstanding, he looked exciting on the ball and he got crosses into the box". In his next appearance for the club, he scored the equalising goal in a 2–1 win at Dagenham & Redbridge, when he [...] "blasted in" [...] a [...] "25-yard blockbuster"– fellow Stevenage loanee Madjo went on to score the winning goal. Myrie-Williams' effort was Vale's first goal in 502 minutes (more than five games) of football. He won a penalty in his fourth game for the club, which was converted by Marc Richards to give Vale a 2–1 win at Hereford United. He returned to Broadhall Way in January having scored one goal in six games for Port Vale, who were unable to extend the loan deal due to an acute lack of funds.|$|E

2500|$|The {{children}} {{return home}} in high spirits, unaware that <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> wrong for their father. Unknown to them, George's decision to reject Von Hussler has cost the bank dearly, {{and he is}} suspended without pay. George explodes with rage at the children and they are sent to the nursery. Reacting to her father's outburst, Mary briefly points out that {{other members of the}} family are rarely there {{to take care of the}} parents, before Jane and Michael get into a fight over Jane's doll Valentine, prompting a displeased Mary to order them to bed and enchant them to sleep. The frightening consequence of Jane's anger becomes apparent moments afterwards, as Valentine and the rest of Jane and Michael's disgruntled toys come to life and join Mary in teaching them a lesson in how to take better care of their belongings and toys (formerly [...] "Temper, Temper", now [...] "Playing the Game").|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Tao Ruspoli, Cockburn said, [...] "No doubt about it, since I got here in the early 70s <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> downhill. The Left is in terrible shape. What's the leading obsession of the Left right now? This whole, I think, mad idea that Bush and Cheney organised {{the attack on the}} World Trade Towers. I think it's absolutely insane. I think [...] are capable of monstrous evil, I just think the theories they have - of no plane hitting the Pentagon - is nutty. It's like flying saucers." [...] He noted that his friend Chuck Spinney had a friend on the plane who was later identified by his dental records because his teeth were found inside the Pentagon. Cockburn writes in standard incisive wit [...] "This doesn’t faze the conspiracists. They’re immune to any reality check. Spinney “worked for the government.” They switched the dental records. The Boeing 757 was flown to Nebraska for a rendez-vous with President Bush, who shot the passengers, burned the bodies on the tarmac and gave Spinney’s friend’s teeth to Dick Cheney to drop through a hole in his trousers amid the debris in the Pentagon." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, if I am, what of it?" [...] {{returned}} Dan Baxter sharply. So many <b>things</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> wrong lately that he {{was thoroughly}} out of humor.|$|R
60|$|But {{enough of}} all this. It is {{time we were}} in Mahren, where the Expedition must be blazing well ahead, if <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> as expected.|$|E

60|$|Then Beatrice remembered. Elizabeth {{had told}} her, {{and she had}} thought it best to accept the situation. The whole <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> out of her mind.|$|R

60|$|The {{absence of}} any {{sentiment}} of triumph in Powers' face or tone made its impression upon the older man. He decided at once that the <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> wrong.|$|R

6000|$|... "We {{are both}} aliens," [...] he said quietly. [...] "Perhaps {{you have heard}} that all <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> ill with me. I am an exile and a failure. I have come here to end my days." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Molly," [...] said he, {{in a tone}} of anxiety, [...] "the foolish <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> {{into the}} woods, I think. Come, lads, we must hunt them down. It's snowin' hard, so we've no time to lose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{must have}} somebody, {{and now the}} <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> on so long, and will end in three months, the goody element will not do much harm, and, unluckily, most women will not act without it." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{had so far}} prevailed that Beaufort muttered {{something}} about not knowing <b>things</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> so far, and assured the magistrates round him of his protection. He even {{went to the door}} and told some of his prime tools of agitation that it was enough, and that they might give the signal of recall; but whether <b>things</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> too far, or whether he was not sincere, the tumult did not quiet down till midnight. After all, the rogues had the worst of it, for two hundred bodies of theirs were picked up, and only three magistrates and twenty-five deputies, though a good many more were hurt.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oak, {{you know}} as well as I that <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> wrong with me lately. I may as well own it. I was going to get a little settled in life; but in some way my plan has come to nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Clara," [...] said he, as {{she came}} towards him with words of greeting, [...] "I am sorry to bring ill news to you, but <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> wrong in the City, and--and I think that I ought to release you from your engagement." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your order {{scarcely}} {{comes as}} a surprise, sir," [...] the general said bitterly. [...] "We have heard firing in our rear for some time, and we were afraid that <b>things</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> badly with us, after all." ...|$|R
