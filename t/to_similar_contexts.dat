It is demonstrated that the complexity of the problem space can be reduced to enable the design of a working prototype of a decision support system. This system estimates the cognitive workload of the user, and offers tailored decision support depending on the state of patient.

The longitudinal structure of our experimental design allows us to assess the effects of the questionnaire manipulation both between and within subject.

In addition, raising awareness about life domains significantly increases reliability and validity of self-reported life satisfaction, by reducing the dispersion of responses and increasing the association between life satisfaction and life domain evaluations. We also detect heterogeneous effects across subgroups of our sample—such as people with children or in bad health—and discuss implications of these findings for research on life satisfaction...|$|R

Human phannacological drug-like conditioned responses are less well researched.

However, to date, no study has explicitly examined whether drug-induced facilitation ofcognitive perfonnance can be conditioned to drug-associated stimuli. The studies in the present thesis set out to test whether the cognitive and mood effects of caffeine could be elicited by a novel context that had been repeatedly paired with caffeine administration. The findings from the present series of experiments supported the original hypothesis by demonstrating caffeine-like cognitive and mood benefits in the caffeine-paired context.

40|$|The {{question}} ‘what {{is working}} memory capacity?’ can be approached from the individual-differences and the experimental perspective. The {{first part of}} the article reviews individual-differences research that aims to determine the source of common variance among tests of working memory and related complex cognitive activities, such as reasoning and text comprehension. I propose that the ability to build, maintain and update temporary bindings between content and context representations underlies the shared variance of these variables. Multiple bindings must be maintained simultaneously for building new structural representations that underlie reasoning and language comprehension. Interference between these bindings limits the complexity of these structural representations. The second part of the article reviews experimental work, informed by computational modelling of the mechanisms of working memory. I introduce an interference-based model of working memory, SOB-CS, and review experiments with complex-span tasks that test predictions from that model. The experiments support the assumption that the capacity of working memory is limited by two forms of interference: interference by superposition of multiple bindings between distributed representations, and interference by confusion of similar items, and of items bound <b>to</b> <b>similar</b> <b>contexts...</b>|$|E

40|$|Software {{modifications}} {{are often}} systematic—they consist of simi-lar, but not identical, program changes to multiple contexts. Exist-ing tools for systematic program transformation are limited because they require programmers to manually prescribe edits or only sug-gest a location to edit with a related example. This paper presents {{the design and}} implementation of a program transformation tool called SYDIT. Given an example edit, SYDIT generates a context-aware, abstract edit script, and then applies the edit script to new program locations. To correctly encode a relative position of the edits in a new location, the derived edit script includes unchanged statements on which the edits are control and data dependent. Fur-thermore, to make the edit script applicable to a new context us-ing different identifier names, the derived edit script abstracts vari-able, method, and type names. The evaluation uses 56 systematic edit pairs from five large software projects as an oracle. SYDIT has high coverage and accuracy. For 82 % of the edits (46 / 56), SYDIT matches the context and applies an edit, producing code that is 96 % similar to the oracle. Overall, SYDIT mimics human programmers correctly on 70 % (39 / 56) of the edits. Generation of edit scripts seeks to improve programmer productivity by relieving develop-ers from tedious, error-prone, manual code updates. It also {{has the potential to}} guide automated program repair by creating program transformations applicable <b>to</b> <b>similar</b> <b>contexts...</b>|$|E

There is a consequent need to evaluate teaching strategies within this new context, uncovering important caveats and promoting the most effective approaches. Masters students at the University of Huddersfield had expressed dissatisfaction with Blackboard, perceiving it to lack the personalisation and community feeling associated with social networks like FaceBook and Ning. Consequently, a Ning network was created to support a single, Masters level module. This study explored how best to use the platform to promote interaction and improve learning outcomes. Tutors gathered ethnomethodological data, documenting the seemingly trivial interactions between members of the network in order to uncover the social processes at work and shed light on the meaning which members attach to this behaviour. The case study was conducted over 3 months, involving twenty students and two tutors. Learners were polled {{at the end of this}} period with over ninety percent preferring Ning to Blackboard. Some clear indicators for what they expected of a tutor in this kind of environment were also uncovered. The findings endorse the use of social networks in educational contexts and inform optimal teaching strategies in future iterations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the strategising {{practices}} of sustainability champions at Transnet, a South African state-owned enterprise (SOE). The study set out to discover what these micro-strategising practices were and what strategic outcomes they had for the organisation at the corporate level of strategy praxis. The problem that this research sought to address was the need for greater progress towards corporate sustainability and the lack of research into the role, contributions and practices of sustainability champions in formal sustainability roles within relatively large organisations. This exploration was carried out in the form of a qualitative single-case study which drew on serial interviews (two per participant) and case documentation as sources of evidence. The data were analysed using Applied Thematic Analysis (ATA) in the CAQDAS software Atlas. ti. The study answered the research questions and found that sustainability champions engaged in seven sets of strategising practices with seven corresponding strategic outcomes. While it was not the intention of the study to develop a conceptual model, the process of synthesising the main findings resulted in a model termed the web of sustainable strategising. The study concludes that sustainability champions are strategists who aid their organisation in the pursuit of corporate sustainability while influencing the direction of macro-institutional arrangements towards sustainable development.

Some focus on ameliorating a particular issue or ‘deficit’ whilst others, such as sporting, recreation and youth groups are more grounded in the community. This article reports a qualitative study undertaken in three remote Indigenous communities in Central Australia. Sixty {{interviews were conducted with}} a range of stakeholders involved in a {{diversity of}} youth programs. A range of critical challenges for and characteristics of remote Indigenous youth programs are identified if such programs are to be ‘fit for context’. ‘Youth centred-context specific’ provides a positive frame for the delivery of youth programs in remote Central Australia, encouraging an explicit focus on program logic; program content and processes; and relational, temporal, and, spatial aspects of the practice context. These provide lenses with which youth program planning and delivery may be enhanced in remote communities. Culturally safe service planning and delivery suggests locally determined processes for decision-making and community ownership. In some cases, this may mean a community preference for all ages to access the service to engage in culturally relevant activities. Where activities are targeted at young people, yet open to and inclusive of all ages, they provide a medium for cross-generational interaction that requires a high degree of flexibility on the part of staff and funding programs. Although the findings are focused in Central Australia, they may be relevant <b>to</b> <b>similar</b> <b>contexts</b> elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{important}} challenges in model‐driven engineering is how {{to improve the quality}} of the models' design in order to help designers understand them. Refactoring represents an efficient technique {{to improve the quality of}} a design while preserving its behavior. Most of existing work on model refactoring relies on declarative rules to detect refactoring opportunities and to apply the appropriate refactorings. However, a complete specification of refactoring opportunities requires a huge number of rules. In this paper, we consider the refactoring mechanism as a combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to find good refactoring suggestions starting from a small set of refactoring examples applied <b>to</b> <b>similar</b> <b>contexts.</b> Our approach, named model refactoring by example, takes as input an initial model to refactor, a set of structural metrics calculated on both initial model and models in the base of examples, and a base of refactoring examples extracted from different software systems and generates as output a sequence of refactorings. A solution is defined as a combination of refactoring operations that should maximize as much as possible the structural similarity based on metrics between the initial model and the models in the base of examples. A heuristic method is used to explore the space of possible refactoring solutions. To this end, we used and adapted a genetic algorithm as a global heuristic search. The validation results on different systems of real‐world models taken from open‐source projects confirm the effectiveness of our approach. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{study of}} the {{academic}} numeracy of nursing students. This study develops a theoretical model for the design and delivery of university courses in academic numeracy. The following objectives are addressed: 1. To investigate nursing students' current knowledge of academic numeracy; 2. To investigate how nursing students’ knowledge and skills in academic numeracy can be enhanced using a developmental psychology framework; and 3. To utilise data derived from meeting objectives 1 and 2 to develop a theoretical model to embed academic numeracy in university programs. This study draws from Valsiner’s Human Development Theory (Valsiner, 1997, 2007). It is a quasi-experimental intervention case study (Faltis, 1997) and takes a multimethod approach using pre- and post-tests; observation notes; and semi-structured teaching sessions to document a series of microgenetic studies of student numeracy. Each microgenetic study is centered on the lived experience of students becoming more numerate. The method for this section is based on Vygotsky’s double stimulation (Valsiner, 2000 a; 2007). Data collection includes interviews on students’ past experience with mathematics; their present feelings and experiences and how these present feelings and experiences are transformed. The findings from this study have provided evidence that the course developed for nursing students, underpinned by an appropriate framework, does improve academic numeracy. More specifically, students improved their content knowledge of and confidence in mathematics in areas that were directly related to their degree. The study used Valsiner’s microgenetic approach to development to trace the course as it was being taught and two students’ personal academic numeracy journeys. It highlighted particularly troublesome concepts, then outlined scaffolding and pathways used to develop understanding. This approach to academic numeracy development was summarised into a four-faceted model at the university, program, course and individual level. This model can be applied successfully <b>to</b> <b>similar</b> <b>contexts.</b> Thus the thesis advances both theory and practice in this under-researched and under-theorised area...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In sub-Saharan Africa, {{women must}} {{overcome}} numerous barriers {{when they need}} modern healthcare. Respect of gender norms within the household and the community may still influence women's ability to obtain care. A lack of gender-sensitive instruments for measuring women's ability to overcome barriers compromises attempts to adequately quantify the burden and risk of exclusion they face when seeking modern healthcare. The {{aim of this study}} was to create and validate a synthetic measure of women's access to healthcare from a publicly available and possibly internationally comparable population-based survey. Method Seven questionnaire items from the Burkina Faso 2003 DHS were combined to create the index. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was used to test the reliability of the index. Exploratory factor analyses (EFA) and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were applied to evaluate the factorial structure and construct validity of the index while taking into account the hierarchical structure of the data. Results The index has a Cronbach's alpha of 0. 75, suggesting adequate reliability. In EFA, three correlated factors fitted the data best. In CFA, the construct of perceived ability to overcome barriers to healthcare seeking emerged as a second-order latent variable with three domains: socioeconomic barriers, geographical barriers and psychosocial barriers. Model fit indices support the index's global validity for women of reproductive age in Burkina Faso. Evidence for construct validity comes from the finding that women's index scores increase with household living standard. Conclusion The DHS items can be combined into a reliable and valid, gender-sensitive index quantifying reproductive-age women's perceived ability to overcome barriers to healthcare seeking in Burkina Faso. The index complies conceptually with the sector-cross-cutting capability approach and enables measuring directly the perceived access to healthcare. Therefore it can help to improve the design and evaluation of interventions that aim to facilitate healthcare seeking in this country. Further analyses may examine how far the index applies <b>to</b> <b>similar</b> <b>contexts.</b> </p...|$|E

Little {{is known about the}} essence of living with HIV, AIDS and abuse among women. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop and refine guidelines for assessment of abuse in women living with HIV and AIDS. The objectives were to explore and describe the experiences of the women in Lilongwe, Malawi and to develop and refine guidelines for assessment of abuse in the women. In phase 1 of the study, descriptive phenomenology as espoused in life world research was used. Data were gathered using unstructured interviews from a purposefully selected sample of 12 women living with HIV and AIDS who had encountered abuse. The data were analysed using qualitative methods. The women’s experiences were characterized by humiliation from partners, families, neighbours and friends; hopelessness and blame. Harm emanated from being beaten, stress suffered from the abuse, interrupted antiretroviral drugs and possible re-infection with HIV due to unprotected sex. Abandonment of the women by their husbands and families was a common occurrence. Phase 2 of the study was the development of guidelines that can be used with women who experience abuse while living with HIV and AIDS. The guidelines were based on discussion of the findings of phase 1 in the context of an extensive literature review on the constituents. Modified Delphi technique was utilized to refine the draft guidelines. Two rounds were used to finalize the guidelines by a panel of ten experts who were purposefully selected based on their involvement in issues of gender-based violence, HIV and AIDS. The study findings though applicable to the context of the study, can be transferable <b>to</b> <b>similar</b> <b>contexts.</b> Recommendations made include validating the assessment guidelines and testing them in practice to evaluate the applicability and feasibility of using the guidelines.

However, there are few evidence-based models for effective integration of nutrition support within clinical Prevention-of-Mother-to-Child-Transmission (PMTCT) services. To address this gap, we aimed: 1) to describe the problem of growth faltering among HIV-exposed uninfected infants at GHESKIO clinic in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, 2) to design an age- and context-appropriate infant feeding support intervention for this population and 3) {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the intervention in improving growth outcomes. Medical record data from 360 HIV-exposed uninfected children seen at GHESKIO between July 2007 and October 2009 were used to describe the growth pattern from birth to 23 mo (Aim 1). They were compared to the WHO 2006 Growth Standard and a nationally-representative sample of same-age Haitian children (n= 1190). GHESKIO children were born proportionally stunted and improved in weight-for-age and length-for-age across the first 6 mo of life. Faltering in weight and length began at 7 mo. Length faltering continued until 24 mo. Outcomes in GHESKIO children were significantly better than the nationally-representative sample at age 24 mo. As part of the intervention-design process (Aim 2), we identified contextual factors that influenced intervention implementation. The support of higher-level stakeholders was a key facilitator. Factors related to the chaotic environment of urban poor HIV-infected mothers were the primary barriers. The caregivers club model provides a promising foundation for integration of nutrition support and PMTCT services at GHESKIO. To assess the impact of the intervention on growth outcomes among a cohort of 6 - 12 month old HIV-exposed, uninfected children (Aim 3), outcomes in intervention participations (n= 72) were compared to a historical control group of children in the GHESKIO PMTCT program in the previous year (n= 294). Participation in the 24 -week intervention was associated with a 67. 3 % decrease in underweight (p=. 007) and 54. 7 % decrease in stunting (p=. 029) around age 12 mo. The magnitude of the benefit on prevalence of growth faltering was large compared to other infant feeding interventions.
