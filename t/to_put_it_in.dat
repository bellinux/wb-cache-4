5|$|In 2008, {{advances}} in DNA analysis allowed {{a more detailed}} study of the fisher's evolutionary history. It was determined that the fisher and the Martes genera were descended from a common ancestor but the fisher was distinct enough <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> its own genera. It was decided to create the Pekania genera and reclassify the fisher as Pekania pennanti.|$|E
5|$|German naturalist Jacob Christian Schäffer was {{the first}} to {{describe}} the species, placing it in Agaricus in 1774. Seven years later in 1781, Jean Bulliard described a species he called Agaricus necator and illustrated it in the first volume of his Herbier de la France; this name and the synonym Lactarius necator, resulting from Christian Hendrik Persoon's 1800 transfer to Lactarius, are both considered to refer to L.torminosus. Otto Kuntze, for his part chose <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Lactifluus, while Paul Kummer thought Galorrheus was the appropriate placement; until the recent resurrection of Lactifluus, both genera had been long considered to be unnecessary segregates of Lactarius. According to Index Fungorum, another synonym is Samuel Frederick Gray's Lactarius necans. Gray also gave the species its modern name when he transferred it to Lactarius in his 1821 Natural Arrangement of British Plants.|$|E

5|$|The Union {{increased}} its pace with Andrew Wenger playing wide {{on the left}} where he repeatedly got past Yedlin {{to get to the}} byline or cut back to shoot. Maidana and Le Toux strengthened Philadelphia's position by combining {{on the other side of}} the field to penetrate Seattle's defense. Wenger connected with Le Toux who took a shot, but Seattle goalkeeper Stefan Frei was quick enough to make the stop. In the 38th minute, Maidana was fouled by Leonardo González wide right of the penalty area. Maidana's resulting free kick curled towards the back post where Brad Evans lost his footing and Edu glanced the ball with his forehead <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the back of the net. The home team kept control of the first half and continued creating scoring opportunities.|$|E
5|$|Zoning {{and land}} use controversies, common {{throughout}} Bellaire's history, resulted in the 1977 recall of the mayor and three council members. The City of Bellaire voted against banning smoking in bars and restaurants on Monday January 15, 2007. Mayor Cindy Siegel and Pat McLaughlan, one council member, voted for the ban, while the other five members, including Peggy Faulk, voted against the ban. The National Restaurant Association asked Bellaire to consider adopting a smoking ban <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> sync with the City of Houston, which adopted a similar ordinance in 2005. In December 2009 the city voted to ban texting while driving. Bans of texting while driving were passed in Bellaire and West University Place, Texas within hours of one another. In 2010 the city voted 5-2 to ban the feeding of cats on public property and establish a rule requiring {{the permission of the}} owner of a piece of private property in order to feed cats on private property. The city received negative e-mail feedback from various locations, including Switzerland.|$|E

25|$|It is {{nonsensical}} and counter-intuitive {{to believe}} that Nature (or God) created human life only {{to allow it to}} end after a definite period of time. A human being must be able to live indefinitely, or <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> another way, it {{should not be allowed to}} die through ageing. There must be something inside us, that can be modified (perhaps at conception) that will shift the entire death pathway into another, parallel pathway, that will have no predetermined end. This ‘something’ is in fact, the evolutionary impetus to achieve higher levels of complexity in the quickest way possible. There should be a way to enhance this process and accelerate our transition from the process of evolution by natural selection to a post-Darwinian, transhumanist domain where indefinite life-spans are the norm.|$|E
25|$|There are {{anomalies}} for all paradigms, Kuhn maintained, {{that are}} brushed away as acceptable levels of error, or simply ignored and not dealt with (a principal argument Kuhn uses to reject Karl Popper's model of falsifiability {{as the key}} force involved in scientific change). Rather, according to Kuhn, anomalies have various levels of significance to the practitioners of science at the time. <b>To</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the context of early 20th century physics, some scientists found the problems with calculating Mercury's perihelion more troubling than the Michelson-Morley experiment results, and some the other way around.
