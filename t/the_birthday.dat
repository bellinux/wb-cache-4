5|$|Most {{people like}} themselves; <b>the</b> <b>birthday</b> is {{associated}} with the self, and hence the numbers in <b>the</b> <b>birthday</b> are preferred, {{despite the fact that they}} appear in many other contexts. People who do not like themselves tend not to exhibit the birthday-number effect. A similar effect, the name-letter effect, has been found for letters: people tend to prefer the letters that are part of their name. The birthday-number effect and the name-letter effect are significantly correlated. In psychological assessments, the Number Preference Task is used to estimate implicit self-esteem.|$|E
