Sometimes this began to be used by a monarch to support the notion that the king ruled both his own kingdom and Church within its boundaries, a theory known as caesaropapism.

50|$|The PRC {{was founded}} in 1924 {{as a result of}} a {{controversy}} regarding common grace in the Christian Reformed Church. At that time the Christian Reformed Church had adopted three doctrinal points on the subject of common grace. Reverends Herman Hoeksema, George Ophoff, and Henry Danhof rejected these three points and maintained them to be contrary to the Reformed confessions of faith. Soon thereafter, when these men said they could not abide by these three points, they were disciplined through suspension, or deposition, from the ministry by their respective classes. The CRC maintained that the position of these three men was inconsistent with the Bible's teachings. The men objected to this deposition also from a church political point of view, arguing that only the consistory has <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>depose</b> their minister, not a classis. The CRC disagreed, and these ministers, as well as their followers, were deposed by the CRC and organized into a new denomination, taking the name of Protesting Christian Reformed Churches. The denomination later renamed itself the Protestant Reformed Churches in America. Rev Hoeksema become the pastor of the First Protestant Reformed Church in Grand Rapids, Michigan.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century there were {{numerous}} writers who declared <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of subjects <b>to</b> <b>depose</b> a bad sovereign, but this position is to be distinguished from Rousseau's doctrine. Thus, if {{we turn to the}} great historic event of 1581, the rejection of the yoke of Spain by the Dutch, we find the Declaration of Independence running, [...] "that if a prince is appointed by God over the land, it is to protect them from harm, even as a shepherd to the guardianship of his flock. The subjects are not appointed by God for the behoof of the prince, but the prince for his subjects, without whom he is no prince." [...] This is obviously divine right, fundamentally modified by a popular principle, accepted to meet the exigencies of the occasion, and to justify after the event a measure which was dictated by urgent need for practical relief. Such a notion of the social compact was still emphatically in the semi-patriarchal stage, and is distinct as can be from the dogma of popular sovereignty as Rousseau understood it. But it plainly marked a step on the way. It was the development of Protestant principles which produced and necessarily involved the extreme democratic conclusion. Time was needed for their full expansion in this sense, but the result could only have been avoided by a suppression of the Reformation, and we therefore count it inevitable. Bodin (1577) had defined sovereignty as residing in the supreme legislative authority, without further inquiry as to the source or seat of that authority, though he admits the vague position which even Lewis XIV. did not deny, that the object of political society is the greatest good of every citizen or the whole state. In 1603 a Protestant professor of law in Germany, Althusen by name, published a treatise of Politics, in which the doctrine of the sovereignty of peoples was clearly formulated, to the profound indignation both of Jesuits and of Protestant jurists.[214] Rousseau mentions his name;[215] it does not appear that he read Althusen's rather uncommon treatise, but its teaching would probably have a place in the traditions of political theorising current at Geneva, to the spirit of whose government it was so congenial. Hooker, vindicating episcopacy against the democratic principles of the Puritans, had still been led, apparently by way of the ever dominant idea of a law natural, to base civil government on the assent of the governed, and had laid down such propositions as these: [...] "Laws they are not, which public approbation hath not made so. Laws therefore human, of what kind soever, are available by consent," [...] and so on.[216] The views of the Ecclesiastical Polity were adopted by Locke, and became the foundation of the famous essay on Civil Government, from which popular leaders in our own country drew all their weapons down to the outbreak of the French Revolution. Grotius (1625) starting from the principle that the law of nature enjoins that we should stand by our agreements, then proceeded to assume either an express, or at any rate a tacit and implied, promise on the part of all who become members of a community, to obey the majority of the body, or a majority of those to whom authority has been delegated.[217] This is a unilateral view of the social contract, and omits the element of reciprocity which in Rousseau's idea was cardinal.|$|R
5000|$|As a Whig, he {{expressly}} repudiated {{the belief}} in divinely appointed monarchic authority {{and the idea that}} a people have no <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>depose</b> an oppressive government; however, he advocated central roles for private property, tradition, and [...] "prejudice" [...] (i.e., adherence to values regardless of their rational basis) to give citizens a stake in their nation's social order. He argued for gradual, constitutional reform, not revolution (in every case except the most qualified case), emphasizing that a political doctrine founded upon abstractions such as liberty and <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> of man could be easily abused to justify tyranny. He saw inherited rights, restated in England from the Magna Carta <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Declaration of <b>Right,</b> as firm and concrete providing continuity (like tradition, [...] "prejudice", inheritable private property), by contrast enforcement of 'speculative' abstract rights might waver and be subject to change based on currents of politics. Instead, he called for the constitutional enactment of specific, concrete rights and liberties as protection against governmental oppression.|$|R

5000|$|Rashid Rida's {{thoughts}} about the separation of religion and state had some similarities with ʿAbduh and Al-Kawakibi. According to the scholar, Eliezer Tauber: He was {{of the opinion that}} according to Islam 'the rule over the nation is in its own hands ... and its government is a sort of a republic. The caliph has no superiority in law over the lowest of the congregation; he only executes the religious law and the will of the nation.' And he added: 'For the Muslims, the caliph is not infallible (ma'sum) and not the source of revelation.' And therefore, 'the nation has <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>depose</b> the imam-caliph, if it finds a reason for doing so'. [...] What is unique in Rida's thought is that he provided details of his ideas about the future Arab empire in a document, which he called the [...] "General Organic Law of the Arab Empire". Rida argued that the general administrative policy of the future empire would be managed by a president, a council of deputies to be elected from the entire empire, and a council of ministers to be chosen by the president from among the deputies. There, the caliph must recognize the 'General Organic Law' and abide by it. He would manage all the religious matters of the empire. Rida's ideal Islamic empire would be administered in practice by a president, while the caliph would administer only religious affairs and would be obliged to recognize the organic law of the empire and abide by it.|$|E
50|$|During {{his brief}} reign, Yazid showed himself an {{exemplary}} ruler, modelling {{himself on the}} pious Umar II (r. 717-720). He was favourably disposed to the Qadariyya, and consciously tried to disassociate himself from the frequent criticism of autocratic rule levelled at his Umayyad predecessors. Thus he promised to refrain from abuses of his power—mostly concerning widespread resentment at heavy taxation, the enrichment of the Umayyads and their adherents, the preference given to Syria over {{other parts of the}} Caliphate, and the long absence of soldiers on distant campaigns—and insisted that not only was he chosen by the community in an assembly (shura), rather than appointed, but that the community had <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>depose</b> him if he failed in his duties or if they found someone more fit to lead them. At the same time, his reign saw the renewed ascendancy of the Yemenis, with Yusuf ibn Umar dismissed and imprisoned after trying, without success, to raise the Qaysis of Iraq into revolt. Yusuf's successor in Iraq and the East was the Kalbi Mansur ibn Jumhur, but he was soon replaced by the son of Umar II, Abdallah ibn Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz. During his brief tenure, Mansur tried to dismiss the governor of Khurasan, Nasr ibn Sayyar, but the latter managed to maintain his post. Yazid died in September 744 after a reign of barely six months. Apparently due to the advice of the Qadariyya, he had appointed his brother, Ibrahim, as his successor, but he did not enjoy much support and was immediately faced with the revolt of Marwan II (r. 744-750), the grandson of Marwan I (r. 684-685) and governor of Upper Mesopotamia.|$|E
50|$|Their {{military}} history is linked {{with that of}} the Iberian states. They assisted in the eviction of the Muslims and doing battle with them, sometimes separately, sometimes with the royal armies. They also had a share in the fatal dissensions which disturbed the Christians of Iberia and brought about more than one schism in the order. Finally they took part in the maritime expeditions against the Muslims. Thus arose the obligation imposed upon aspirants to serve six months in the galleys, which still existed in the eighteenth century, but from which exemption was easily purchased. Authority was exercised by a grand master assisted by a Council of Thirteen, which elected the grand master and had <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>depose</b> him for due cause; they had supreme jurisdiction in all disputes between members of the order. The first grand master, Pedro Fernández de Castro, died in 1184. He had had 39 successors, among them several Spanish Infantes, when, in 1499, Ferdinand the Catholic induced the pope to assign to him the administration of the order. Under Charles V, Pope Adrian VI annexed to the crown of Spain the three great military orders (Alcántara, Calatrava, and Santiago) with hereditary transmission even in the female line (1522). Thenceforth the three orders were united under one government, though their titles and possessions remained separate. To discharge the detail of this administration, Charles V instituted a special ministry, the Council of Orders, composed of a president named by the king, whom he represented, and six knights, two delegates from each order. To this council belonged the presentation of knights to vacant commanderies and jurisdiction in all matters, civil or ecclesiastical, save the purely spiritual cases reserved for ecclesiastical dignitaries. Thus ended the autonomy of the orders, but not their prestige.|$|E

5000|$|After {{the civil}} had ended, and while Mary {{remained}} captive, full-length books were published, not only setting out the context and {{events of the}} struggle, but examining the historical and theoretical aspects of monarchical rule in Scotland. George Buchanan wrote De Jure Regni apud Scotos (The Law of Kingship Amongst the Scots) (1579) and, as a sympathiser of the Queen's party, David Chambers of Ormond published the Histoire Abbregee de tous les Roys de France, Angleterre et Escosse, Paris (1579). These works, like Buchanan's History of Scotland (1572), retold the stories of ancient Scottish Kings, many mythical who had been deposed justly or unjustly by their subjects, and might be compared with Mary. Both Buchanan and Chambers were patriotic writers and shared a view of Scottish kingship drawn largely from myth, that the Scots had been a migrant people from Scythia who had elected their first king, Fergus I, {{in response to a}} crisis, 251 years after their arrival in Scotland. The historian Roger A. Mason describes the central premiss of Buchanan's De Jure Regni, which is at odds with ideas of absolute monarchy;Buchanan expounded a theory of popular sovereignty whose central premiss was that kings were appointed by the people to perform on their behalf a set of well-defined functions. It followed that if they failed to carry out their duties satisfactorily, thereby breaking the contract entered into by terms of their coronation oath, the people had <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>depose</b> them in favour of someone more able to fulfil the duties of the royal office. Monarchy, in short, was an elective form of government and kings were accountable to those who elected them. Buchanan wrote that [...] "wicked kings, so often as they intended tyranny over their subjects, were restrained" [...] insisting that in his day a similar custom persisted in the election of Clan Chiefs among the Highlanders or [...] "Old Scots". The same legend had already been used by Mary's adherents to opposite effect. In December 1569, a supporter of Mary, perhaps John Lesley, had argued that the election of Fergus I and the resultant nature of Scottish kingship meant that the Scottish parliament could not have been competent to accept Mary's abdication.|$|E
40|$|While the Church of England in {{the mother}} country had {{developed}} the organizational structure that permitted it to respond successfully to its critics, the Anglican Church in Virginia and Maryland struggled with structural failures and problems pertinent to the American geography and ethnic composition. The absence of a resident bishop, the diverse ethnic origins of the colonials, {{as well as the}} existence of large numbers of slaves and Indians, together with the great extent of the parishes, rendered the task of colonial ministers extremely difficult. Despite the diligence of some clergymen, the Anglican Church in the Chesapeake failed to bring large numbers of converts into its fold and to gain, therefore, a firm footing on the American soil. As a result, it took the form of an institution which was more appealing to the elite than to those of a low social background. Among the former, there were numerous examples of piety and devotion which exhibit a true attachment to the ideals of Anglican civil theology. The great power that local elites acquired within the colonial church establishment of Virginia and Maryland prevented Anglican clergymen from developing an independent stance which would have allowed them to influence public opinion in the colonies in a staunchly conservative way. As a result, Anglican clergymen failed to stem the revolutionary tide that swept the region in mid-eighteenth century. There are elements, however, of Anglican political thought in the arguments voiced by the statesmen of the new nation in Virginia and in Maryland. Such ideas as the perception of society as an organic whole, the propriety of elite rule, the authority of governmental institutions to promote public virtue, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>depose</b> a monarch - when he acted in an unconstitutional way - and the importance of moderate and peaceful demeanour were cherished by Anglicans at both sides of the Atlantic...|$|E
