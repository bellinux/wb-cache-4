On {{the opening day}} of the Test series, on a pitch suited to batting, Khan took his maiden five-wicket haul in Tests.

During the fifth ODI he suffered the first injury of his career: a partial tear of <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> abdomen. As a result, he was unable to play for six weeks and missed Pakistan's tour of Bangladesh in November and December. His match winning performance also came during a T20 match against England.|$|E
500|$|Tanner {{became known}} as [...] "Whistler’s Mother’s Boy", [...] "The Whistling Troubador," [...] and [...] "the nation’s best-known whistler". Tanner was noted for {{the ease with which}} he hit high notes and {{performed}} trills. [...] He had the ability to whistle while triple-tonguing, and like Bing Crosby, he was able to whistle from his throat due to <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> larynx. [...] His range was from low G to high B. [...] Professional whistler Joel Brandon has named Tanner as a [...] "top pick". Ted Weems considered Tanner's whistling so important to his band, he insured the musician's throat with Lloyd's of London for $10,000 in 1939. The policy provided payment for any medical expenses related to Tanner's possible inability to whistle and included payment to the holder if Tanner was unable to perform.|$|E

500|$|... "Vitt {{finally decided}} to use Jeff Heath, the chap with <b>the</b> bulging <b>muscles,</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> left pasture.

Fine later played the violin in the Stooge films. [...] In scenes where all three Stooges are playing fiddles, only Larry is actually playing, while the other two are pantomiming.|$|R
5000|$|Brickley {{was on his}} way to {{the best}} season of <b>his</b> career <b>in</b> 1989-90 before being struck down by injuries. He scored his first goal of the season on October 26, 1989 against the Quebec Nordiques. On November 18, he {{collected}} his first career hat trick against the Devils, the team that left him unprotected in the waiver draft two years earlier. Brickley said of the occasion, [...] "Whenever I can score against New Jersey, it is that much sweeter...I wanted to show them they made a mistake." [...] Just days later, Brickley suffered an injury that severely hindered his ability to walk. In January, he pulled a <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> thigh and missed about a week's worth of games. 43 games into the season, after totalling a career-high 40 points, Brickley was sidelined for most of the remainder of the season when doctors discovered that <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> right leg was calcifying, a condition known as myositis ossificans. Despite the injury and the fact that Brickley had not played in months, Milbury permitted Brickley to play briefly in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Finals at Brickley's request.|$|R

50|$|In 1984 equestrian {{sculptor}} Irene French of Dorset, England {{was commissioned}} to sculpt an 11 inch high {{replica of the}} ‘Torrie Horse’. She completed this commission in 6 weeks. It was then cast in bronze by the Morris Singer Bronze Foundry of Basingstoke, England. This became the trophy for the American Breeders Cup, awarded annually to the winners {{of each of the}} Breeders Races.The Torrie bronze was thought to have been used to teach equine anatomy in the Middle Ages.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Tour de France, Ag2r {{had one of}} their better single-day {{finishes}} {{of the season with}} Chérel taking fifth place at Polynormande. Ravard had a string of top-ten placings in the later season, coming third at Paris–Brussels, eighth at the Grand Prix d'Isbergues, and seventh at Paris–Bourges. Ravard was also the rider responsible for the team's lone single-day victory of the season at the Châteauroux Classic, where he raced as the defending champion and took his third career win in the event. Ravard won a large field sprint, a victory which he felt validated his career. He had been considering retirement due to a medical abnormality, as a <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> left leg is twice the size of <b>the</b> same <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> right.|$|R

Through strong willpower, Dan ignores the injury and runs much faster than he did before, easily passing the other athletes. Before he can cross the finish line, the Agents detect that his signal is getting unstable in the Matrix due to his massive burst of energy. Three of the agents possess the three closest runners and try to stop him, but are unable to catch up to him.|$|E

By July 1989, he was pitching in the minors, and on August 10, he made a highly publicized return to the major leagues, pitching 8 innings and defeating Cincinnati 4-3. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> following start five days later against the Expos, Dravecky pitched three no-hit innings, but in the fifth inning, he felt a tingling sensation <b>in</b> <b>his</b> arm. <b>In</b> the sixth inning he started off shaky, allowing a home run to the lead off batter and then hitting the second batter.

5000|$|Lamarck {{incorporated}} two {{ideas into}} {{his theory of}} evolution, in his day considered to be generally true. The first {{was the idea of}} use versus disuse; he theorized that individuals lose characteristics they do not require, or use, and develop characteristics that are useful. His second point was to argue that the acquired traits were heritable. Examples of what is traditionally called [...] "Lamarckism" [...] would include the idea that when giraffes stretch their necks to reach leaves high in trees (especially Acacias), they strengthen and gradually lengthen their necks. These giraffes have offspring with slightly longer necks (also known as [...] "soft inheritance"). Similarly, a blacksmith, through his work, strengthens <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> arms, and thus his sons will have similar muscular development when they mature.|$|E

50|$|Daw was {{originally}} {{diagnosed with a}} rare condition known as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. During a number of tests, medical doctors in 1990 re-diagnosed Daw with an even rarer condition known as fetal stroke.The condition has left Daw {{as one of the}} rare survivors who has lived longer than any others. Because of how the condition affected Daw, <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> legs never developed. Although his legs do not generate enough strength to walk, he has experienced no loss of sensation and can use them generally for all other purposes. Daw also had his left hand and forearm impacted by the condition, which has often affected his classification during his Paralympic career. Due to this, he is the only Paralympic athlete in history who has fulfilled classification requirements for both paraplegic and quadriplegics thus allowing him to participate in wheelchair rugby and sport reserved for quadriplegics.|$|E

He'd suffered a clean break midway between his shoulder and elbow, ending his season.|$|R
50|$|After another {{substitute}} {{appearance in}} the 2-1 away defeat to Liverpool, Digard once again came off the bench in the 2-1 home win against Stoke City. Once again, a mishit shot from Digard turned into an assist, with the ball falling to Tuncay to score the winner. On 17 January 2009, Digard was sent off against West Bromwich Albion for a tackle on Borja Valero. In a match again Wigan on 21 February 2009 which resulted 0-0 draw, Digard {{was involved in a}} challenge by Lee Cattermole and was stretchered off midway through the first half suffering an injury to <b>his</b> medial ligaments <b>in</b> <b>his</b> right knee as well as a rupture to <b>the</b> quadriceps <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> left leg.

On 26 April 2009, Digard returned to action, coming on a substitute for Tony McMahon after 73 minutes in a 2-0 loss against Arsenal. At the end of the season, Middlesbrough were relegated to the Championship after 11 successive years in the Premier League.|$|R
6000|$|Martin had ascended from {{pitch to}} pitch of {{intellectual}} living, {{and here he}} was at a higher pitch than ever. All the hidden things were laying their secrets bare.

At table he failed to hear the conversation about petty and ignoble things, his eager mind seeking out and following cause and effect in everything before him.
