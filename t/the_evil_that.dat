500|$|The Historian {{has been}} {{described}} as a combination of genres, including Gothic novel, adventure novel, detective fiction, travelogue, postmodern historical novel, epistolary epic, and historical thriller. Kostova was intent on writing a serious work of literature and saw herself as an inheritor of the Victorian style. Although based in part on Bram Stoker's Dracula, The Historian is not a horror novel, but rather an eerie tale. It is concerned with history's role in society and representation in books, as well as the nature of good and evil. As Kostova explains, [...] "Dracula is a metaphor for <b>the</b> <b>evil</b> <b>that</b> is so hard to undo in history." [...] The evils brought about by religious conflict are a particular theme, and the novel explores the relationship between the Christian West and the Islamic East.|$|E
500|$|As Kostova explains, [...] "Dracula is {{a metaphor}} for <b>the</b> <b>evil</b> <b>that</b> is so hard to undo in history." [...] For example, he is shown {{influencing}} Eastern European tyrants and supporting national socialism in Transylvania. He is [...] "vainglorious, vindictive, [...] vicious". As Michael Dirda explains in The Washington Post, the novel conveys the idea that [...] "Most of history's worst nightmares result from an unthinking obedience to authority, high-minded zealotry seductively overriding our mere humanity." [...] It is in the figure of the vampire that Kostova reveals this, since [...] "our fear of Dracula lies in the fear of losing ourselves, of relinquishing our very identities as human beings". In fact, the narrator is never named in the novel, suggesting, as one critic explains, [...] "that the quest for the dark side of human nature is more universal than specific to a concrete character".|$|E

500|$|The premise behind [...] "Chimera" [...] was [...] "a {{compelling}} {{examination of}} <b>the</b> <b>evil</b> <b>that</b> lies beneath a prototypical white-bread suburban existence." [...] These themes {{had previously been}} explored in the season six episode, [...] "Arcadia". However, the show wished to explore the same ideas in a more [...] "straight-ahead scare" [...] style, rather than supplementing {{the horror of the}} episode with humor, as was done in [...] "Arcadia". Series creator, Chris Carter, saw the episode as [...] "a chance to do something bold and new." [...] Carter wanted the story to revolve around a crow, an image that he described simply as [...] "scary". With the story, he wanted to [...] "bust pretense and perception and expose the underbelly of a white-bread community." [...] Originally, the episode was going to feature a subterranean monster and was aptly going to be titled [...] "Subterranean Monster Blues".|$|E
500|$|Camila, General Canales's daughter, is (somewhat reluctantly) {{rescued by}} Miguel Angel Face, when {{none of her}} {{relatives}} will take her in upon the flight of her father. Eventually Angel Face chooses Camila over his former master, the President. The two marry and she gives birth to his son, but only once Angel Face has disappeared. She and her son, whom she names Miguel, are last seen having moved to the countryside to escape the President's influence. She is the very picture of the adolescent who has been denied even the smallest margin of liberty, as critic Callan observes: [...] "when Camila {{was thought to be}} dying a priest came to administer the sacrament of Penance. Her girlish faults stand out in the contrast with <b>the</b> <b>evil</b> <b>that</b> weighs upon the city. Indeed, one of the things she mentions in her confession is no fault at all: she went horseback riding astride, in the presence of somegbujyvj Indians." ...|$|E

[...] Music journalist Bill Graham wrote [...] "For the first time, [...] was owning up {{to the dangers of}} the dualism implicit in Christianity", comparing the song's spiritual and musical tone to that of the Virgin Prunes. David Werther, a faculty associate in Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, compared [...] "Exit" [...] with U2's 1991 song [...] "Until the End of the World" [...] in an examination of the role music can play in catharsis. He noted that both were powerful songs, but that while [...] "Until the End of the World" [...] allowed the possibility of purification, which he described as the cleansing of the soul [...] "through pity and fear", by placing the listener in the position of Judas Iscariot, [...] "Exit" [...] was an example of purgation, a freeing from excess pity and fear. Werther noted [...] "'Exit' evokes feelings of fear, fear of losing control, giving into one's dark side, perhaps even taking one's life", contrasting it to the [...] "waves of regret" [...] experienced by Judas.|$|E

500|$|Alucard {{appears in}} the sequel [...] as a {{supporting}} character. Since the game takes place centuries later, Alucard's personality and standing towards his father has drastically changed. He believes that Dracula can still be redeemed and makes it his goal to free the world from tyranny and vanquish <b>the</b> <b>evil</b> <b>that</b> had corrupted him and his father. He concocts a centuries spanning plan to put his father {{into a deep sleep}} by piercing his heart with the Crissaegrim sword, in order to make both the lord of the dead, Zobek and Satan himself, believe that Dracula is dead, so they can come out in the open. Once they do, Alucard would remove the sword so Dracula can resurrect and then destroy Zobek and Satan for good. Dracula agrees with his son's plan and awakens centuries later during modern times. Throughout the game Alucard also appears as a younger Trevor Belmont and guides Dracula through his Castle to help him recover his old powers and missing memories. In order to not draw suspicion to his plan, Alucard masquerades himself as Zobek's Lieutenant and eventually reveals his true identity to his father once he remembers their pact. They destroy Zobek and Satan and appear to be on good terms in the end. Alucard is also the protagonist of the DLC Revelations, taking place shortly prior to the events of the game.|$|E

2500|$|Kierkegaard {{talks about}} the same things he's been talking about in all his writings, self-knowledge. He says, [...] "Everyone else would presumably {{understand}} that self-knowledge is a difficult matter; although {{it is easy to}} understand the rest of the world, the understanding suddenly changes very substantially when it pertains to oneself." [...] He speaks of choosing oneself in Either/Or, [...] "When a person considers himself esthetically his soul is like soil out of which grow all sorts of herbs, all with equal claim to flourish; his self consists of this multiplicity, and he has no self that is higher than this (...) Someone who views the personality ethically has at once an absolute difference: namely, the difference between good and evil. And if he finds more of evil in him than of good, this still does not mean that it is <b>the</b> <b>evil</b> <b>that</b> is to advance, but it means that it is <b>the</b> <b>evil</b> <b>that</b> is to recede and the good that is to advance. (...) It truly takes considerable ethical courage to acknowledge the good as the highest, because one thereby falls into altogether universal categories." ...|$|E

The book further records the decision of the people to be ruled no longer by kings, choosing instead a form of democracy led by elected judges. When citizens referred to as [...] "king-men" [...] attempted to overthrow a democratically elected government and establish an unrighteous king, the book praises a military commander who executed pro-monarchy citizens who had vowed to destroy the church of God and were unwilling to defend their country from hostile invading forces. The book also speaks favorably of a particular instance of {{what appears to be a}} peaceful Christ-centered theocracy, which lasted approximately 194 years before contentions began again.|$|E

2500|$|In Jainism, {{forgiveness}} {{is one of}} the main virtues that needs to be cultivated by the Jains. Kṣamāpanā or supreme forgiveness forms part of one of the ten characteristics of dharma. In the Jain prayer, (pratikramana) Jains repeatedly seek forgiveness from various creatures—even from ekindriyas or single sensed beings like plants and microorganisms that they may have harmed while eating and doing routine activities. Forgiveness is asked by uttering the phrase, Micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ. Micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ is a Prakrit language phrase literally meaning [...] "may all <b>the</b> <b>evil</b> <b>that</b> has been done be fruitless." [...] During samvatsari—the last day of Jain festival paryusana—Jains utter the phrase Micchami Dukkadam after pratikraman. As a matter of ritual, they personally greet their friends and relatives micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ seeking their forgiveness. No private quarrel or dispute may be carried beyond samvatsari, and letters and telephone calls are made to the outstation friends and relatives asking their forgiveness.|$|E
2500|$|Thus, {{the moment}} Adam and Eve ate the fruit from the tree—which God had {{commanded}} {{them not to}} do—sinful death was born; {{it was an act}} of disobedience, thinking they could become like gods, that was the sin. Since Adam was the head of the human race, he is held responsible for <b>the</b> <b>evil</b> <b>that</b> took place, for which reason the fall of man is referred to as the [...] "sin of Adam". This sin caused Adam and his descendants to lose unrestricted access to God Himself. [...] The years of life were limited. [...] "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned" [...] (...) [...] In Christian theology, the death of Jesus on the cross is the atonement to the sin of Adam. [...] "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive." [...] (...) [...] [...] As a result of that act of Christ, all who put their trust in Christ alone now have unrestricted access to God through prayer and in presence.|$|E

They aim to discover the villain's plans for the city of Vale before the Vytal Festival—a festival between the four kingdoms of Remnant where they have their best students demonstrate their skills and abilities in celebration of the peace between all four kingdoms.
