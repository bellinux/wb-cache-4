5|$|The state {{accounts}} for ~80% of the United States' volcanoes, excluding the seamounts in the area, ~8% of world volcanoes, {{and most of}} these are located among the Aleutian Islands. The Aleutian Islands arc serves as the northern boundary of the Pacific Ring of Fire, where <b>tectonic</b> <b>activity</b> generates earthquakes and volcanic eruptions in masses.|$|E
5|$|Seismic {{activity}} in Indonesia is {{monitored by the}} Directorate of Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation, Indonesia. The monitoring post for Mount Tambora is located at Doro Peti village. They use a seismograph to measure seismic and <b>tectonic</b> <b>activity.</b> Since the 1880 eruption, no significant increase in seismic activity has occurred. Monitoring is performed continuously inside the caldera, especially around the Doro Api Toi parasitic cone.|$|E
40|$|Morphotectonics {{indices are}} helpful for {{identify}} {{the properties of}} one region Such as determination of <b>tectonics</b> <b>activity</b> level. We use this indices for obtaining the details of active tectonics in Jahan abad- Abadeh Tashk basin where is located at high Zagros zone. The Basin shape, Asymmetry factor and Hypsometry integral calculated for this purpose. Geological map, satellite image of Google earth and processing geological map softwares such as Elwise and Arc GIS is used. The results show that Jahan abad – Abadeh Tashk is located at moderate <b>tectonics</b> <b>activity</b> level...|$|R
50|$|The surface {{observation}} include impact craters, volcanoes and lava flow channels, which give clues {{to estimate the}} surface age, possible global resurfacing events, <b>tectonic</b> <b>activities,</b> internal structure and surface processes.|$|R
50|$|The Teesta river has {{preserved}} good imprints of climatic and tectonics {{along its}} valleys and catchments.The interrelationship between climate, erosion, deposition and <b>tectonic</b> <b>activities</b> is not properly understood to date. These are being studied.|$|R
5|$|Although Mars has no {{evidence}} of a structured global magnetic field, observations show that parts of the planet's crust have been magnetized, suggesting that alternating polarity reversals of its dipole field have occurred in the past. This paleomagnetism of magnetically susceptible minerals is similar to the alternating bands found on Earth's ocean floors. One theory, published in 1999 and re-examined in October 2005 (with the help of the Mars Global Surveyor), is that these bands suggest plate <b>tectonic</b> <b>activity</b> on Mars four billion years ago, before the planetary dynamo ceased to function and the planet's magnetic field faded.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede is {{composed}} of approximately equal amounts of silicate rock and water ice. It is a fully differentiated body with an iron-rich, liquid core, and an internal ocean that may contain more water than all of Earth's oceans combined. Its surface {{is composed}} of two main types of terrain. Dark regions, saturated with impact craters and dated to four billion years ago, cover {{about a third of}} the satellite. Lighter regions, crosscut by extensive grooves and ridges and only slightly less ancient, cover the remainder. The cause of the light terrain's disrupted geology is not fully known, but was likely the result of <b>tectonic</b> <b>activity</b> due to tidal heating.|$|E
5|$|The Mendip Hills are {{the most}} southerly Carboniferous Limestone upland in Britain. The rock strata known as the Carboniferous Limestone were laid down during the early Carboniferous Period, about 320–350million years ago. Subsequently, much of northwestern Europe {{underwent}} continental collision throughout the late Paleozoic Era, culminating in the final phases of the Variscan orogeny {{near the end of}} the Carboniferous, 300million years ago. This <b>tectonic</b> <b>activity</b> produced a complex suite of mountain and hill ranges across what is now southern Ireland, south-western England, Brittany, and elsewhere in western Europe.|$|E
30|$|<b>Tectonic</b> <b>activities</b> are {{represented}} by several normal faults along this section causing more changes in the position (depth) of each formation relative {{to one another and}} providing several horsts (high structural features) and graben structures.|$|R
50|$|The Panama Civil Defense Seismic Network {{collects}} {{and studies}} ground motion from about 60 seismometers throughout Panama. These stations monitor volcanoes, <b>tectonic</b> <b>activities,</b> rivers, and tsunami to give fast, real-time information and warnings about these potential hazards.|$|R
30|$|They {{occur in}} {{response}} to smaller-scale (short-term) events, such as storms, regular wave action, tides and winds, or {{in response to}} large-scale (long-term) events that may significantly alter sea levels (rise/fall) and <b>tectonic</b> <b>activities</b> that cause coastal land subsidence or emergence (Prasetya 2007).|$|R
5|$|The {{lineages}} of rorquals {{and right}} whales split almost 20mya. It is unknown where this occurred, {{but it is}} generally believed that they, like their descendants, followed plankton migrations. These primitive mysticetes had lost their heterodont dentition in favor of baleen, and {{are believed to have}} lived on a specialized benthic, plankton, or copepod diet like modern mysticetes. Mysticetes experienced their first radiation in the mid-Miocene. Balaenopterids grew bigger during this time, with species like Balaenoptera sibbaldina rivaling the blue whale in terms of size. It is thought this radiation was caused by global climate change and major <b>tectonic</b> <b>activity</b> when Antarctica and Australia separated from each other, creating the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.|$|E
5|$|Although Callisto is {{very similar}} in bulk {{properties}} to Ganymede, it apparently had a much simpler geological history. The surface {{appears to have been}} shaped mainly by impacts and other exogenic forces. Unlike neighboring Ganymede with its grooved terrain, there is little evidence of <b>tectonic</b> <b>activity.</b> Explanations that have been proposed for the contrasts in internal heating and consequent differentiation and geologic activity between Callisto and Ganymede include differences in formation conditions, the greater tidal heating experienced by Ganymede, and the more numerous and energetic impacts that would have been suffered by Ganymede during the Late Heavy Bombardment. The relatively simple geological history of Callisto provides planetary scientists with a reference point for comparison with other more active and complex worlds.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the oldest}} rocks in Oregon, {{some of the}} {{formations}} in these terranes date to the Triassic, nearly 250million years ago. Between 165 and 170million years ago, in the Jurassic, faulting consolidated the Klamath terranes offshore during what geologists call the Siskiyou orogeny. This three- to five-million-year episode of intense <b>tectonic</b> <b>activity</b> pushed sedimentary rocks deep enough into the mantle to melt them and then forced them to the surface as granitic plutons. Belts of plutons, which contain gold and other precious metals, run through the Klamaths and include the Ashland pluton, the Grayback batholith east of Oregon Caves National Monument, the Grants Pass pluton, the Gold Hill pluton, the Jacksonville pluton, and others. Miners have worked rich deposits of gold, silver, copper, nickel, and other metals in several districts of the Klamaths. Placer mining in the mid-19thcentury soon led to lode mining for gold. Aside from a mine in eastern Oregon, the Greenback Mine along Grave Creek, a Rogue tributary, was the most productive gold mine in Oregon.|$|E
50|$|When {{analyzing}} the morphology of marine terraces {{it must be}} considered, that both eustasy and isostasy can have an influence on the formation process. This way can be assessed, whether there were changes in sea level or whether <b>tectonic</b> <b>activities</b> took place.|$|R
50|$|Sattal is {{situated}} in the Lower Himalayan Range and {{is the result of}} <b>tectonic</b> <b>activities</b> and the uplifting of sediments between the Tibetan plain and the Indo-Gangetic plains. The rocks are mainly sedimentary rocks and quartzite. Physiographically the area can be divided into lower Himalayas and terraces.|$|R
50|$|Following an {{earthquake}} {{in the project}} area (which lasted for 5 seconds and {{had no effect on}} the safety of the dam), a proposal has been mooted to install a seismograph near Selaulim dam (location 5 km from the Sanguem town) to monitor any <b>Tectonics</b> <b>activity</b> in the area.|$|R
5|$|The Chetco River {{flows through}} the ancient Klamath Mountain terrane, which is between 400 and 100million years old, the oldest rocks in Oregon. The Klamath {{microcontinent}} was originally located beneath the ocean near southern California before separating {{hundreds of millions of}} years ago. Plate tectonics pushed the microcontinent north, and bits of granite, sea floor sediment, subduction zones, and coral reefs gradually accreted into small islands. Between 212 and 170million years ago, a massive volcanic arc erupted on the Klamath microcontinent, binding the islands together in a single block. The Klamath microcontinent went through a period of intense <b>tectonic</b> <b>activity</b> known as the Siskiyou orogeny roughly 170 to 165million years ago. The process was strong enough to force sedimentary rocks deep into the Earth's crust, melting them into large plutons of granite, which rose slowly to the surface. Shortly after, a large portion of sea floor was thrust over the older Klamath terranes; much of it is still visible atop Vulcan and Chetco peaks. This region is known as the Josephine Ophiolite, and contains a rare type of rock called peridotite, originating from the Earth's mantle.|$|E
5|$|The Mendip Hills, {{of which}} Brean Down forms the most {{westerly}} part, {{are the most}} southerly Carboniferous Limestone upland in Britain. These rock strata were laid down during the early Carboniferous period, about 320–350million years ago. Subsequently, much of northwestern Europe underwent continental collision throughout the late Paleozoic era, culminating in the final phases of the Variscan orogeny {{near the end of}} the Carboniferous period, 300million years ago. This <b>tectonic</b> <b>activity</b> produced a complex suite of mountain and hill ranges across what is now southern Ireland, south-western England, Brittany, and elsewhere in western Europe. As a result of the Variscan mountain-building, the Mendip area now comprises at least four anticlinal fold structures, with an east-west trend, each with a core of older Devonian sandstone and Silurian volcanic rocks. West of the main Mendip plateau the Carboniferous Limestone continues in Bleadon Hill and Brean Down, and on the islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm.|$|E
5|$|The largest KBOs, such as Pluto and Quaoar, have {{surfaces}} rich in volatile compounds such as methane, {{nitrogen and}} carbon monoxide; {{the presence of}} these molecules is likely due to their moderate vapor pressure in the 30–50K temperature range of the Kuiper belt. This allows them to occasionally boil off their surfaces and then fall again as snow, whereas compounds with higher boiling points would remain solid. The relative abundances of these three compounds in the largest KBOs is directly related to their surface gravity and ambient temperature, which determines which they can retain. Water ice has been detected in several KBOs, including members of the Haumea family such as , mid-sized objects such as 38628 Huya and 20000 Varuna, and also on some small objects. The presence of crystalline ice on large and mid-sized objects, including 50000 Quaoar where ammonia hydrate has also been detected, may indicate past <b>tectonic</b> <b>activity</b> aided by melting point lowering due to the presence of ammonia.|$|E
5000|$|The Cycladic Massif is a Miocene {{high-pressure}} orogenic segment {{located in}} the Aegean Sea underlying the Cyclades. [...] Initially, the Massif was a single island which began to break apart due to the <b>tectonic</b> <b>activities</b> of the subduction of the African plate under the Eurasian plate during the late Miocene Epoch.|$|R
50|$|Sabail is {{the name}} of a {{historical}} monument (castle) built in the XIII century located near the Baku Bay and remained under the sea water due to <b>tectonic</b> <b>activities</b> in the XIV century. Sabail Castle surrounded with a stone wall (180 m length and 40 m width) consisting of 3 circular and 12 semicircular towers.|$|R
30|$|At {{the western}} {{margin of the}} Great South Basin, a prograding delta which was {{initiated}} by thermal subsidence was formed in the Paleocene. Sediment supply to this delta halted following the final opening of the Solander and Emerald sub-basins. This margin was also heavily affected by <b>tectonic</b> <b>activities</b> in Oligocene–Miocene (King 2000; Constable et al. 2013).|$|R
5|$|Umbriel's heavily cratered surface has {{probably}} been stable since the Late Heavy Bombardment. The only signs of the ancient internal activity are canyons and dark polygons—dark patches with complex shapes measuring from tens to hundreds of kilometers across. The polygons were identified from precise photometry of Voyager 2s images and are distributed more or less uniformly {{on the surface of}} Umbriel, trending northeast–southwest. Some polygons correspond to depressions of a few kilometers deep and may have been created during an early episode of <b>tectonic</b> <b>activity.</b> Currently there is no explanation for why Umbriel is so dark and uniform in appearance. Its surface may be covered by a relatively thin layer of dark material (so called umbral material) excavated by an impact or expelled in an explosive volcanic eruption. Alternatively, Umbriel's crust may be entirely composed of the dark material, which prevented formation of bright features like crater rays. However, the presence of the bright feature within Wunda seems to contradict this hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Geologists {{believe that}} coast of western India {{came into being}} around 100 to 80mya after it broke away from Madagascar. Soon after its detachment, the peninsular region of the Indian plate drifted over the Réunion hotspot, a {{volcanic}} hotspot in the Earth's lithosphere near the island of Réunion. An eruption here some 66mya {{is thought to have}} laid down the Deccan Traps, a vast bed of basalt lava that covers parts of central India. This volcanic activity resulted in the formation of basaltic outcrops, such as the Gilbert Hill, that are seen at various locations in the city. Further <b>tectonic</b> <b>activity</b> in the region {{led to the formation of}} hilly islands separated by a shallow sea. Pleistocene sediments found near Kandivali in northern Mumbai by British archaeologist Todd in 1939 indicate habitation since the Stone Age. The present day city was built on what was originally an archipelago of seven islands of Bombay Island, Parel, Mazagaon, Mahim, Colaba, Worli, and Old Woman's Island (also known as Little Colaba). The islands were coalesced into a single landmass by the Hornby Vellard engineering project in 1784. By 1000 BCE, the region was heavily involved in seaborne commerce with Egypt and Persia. The Koli fishing community had long inhabited the islands. They were Dravidian in origin and included a large number of scattered tribes along the Vindhya Plateau, Gujarat, and Konkan. In Mumbai, there were three or four of these tribes. Their religious practices could be summed up as animism.|$|E
5|$|The heating {{mechanism}} {{required for}} the formation of the grooved terrain on Ganymede is an unsolved problem in the planetary sciences. The modern view is that the grooved terrain is mainly tectonic in nature. Cryovolcanism is thought to have played only a minor role, if any. The forces that caused the strong stresses in the Ganymedian ice lithosphere necessary to initiate the <b>tectonic</b> <b>activity</b> may be connected to the tidal heating events in the past, possibly caused when the satellite passed through unstable orbital resonances. The tidal flexing of the ice may have heated the interior and strained the lithosphere, leading to the development of cracks and horst and graben faulting, which erased the old, dark terrain on 70% of the surface. The formation of the grooved terrain may also be connected with the early core formation and subsequent tidal heating of Ganymede's interior, which may have caused a slight expansion of Ganymede by 1–6 % due to phase transitions in ice and thermal expansion. During subsequent evolution deep, hot water plumes may have risen from the core to the surface, leading to the tectonic deformation of the lithosphere. Radiogenic heating within the satellite is the most relevant current heat source, contributing, for instance, to ocean depth. Research models have found that if the orbital eccentricity were an order of magnitude greater than currently (as it may have been in the past), tidal heating would be a more substantial heat source than radiogenic heating.|$|E
50|$|During the Middle Jurassic epoch, Pangaea {{began to}} {{separate}} into Laurasia and Gondwana, and the Atlantic Ocean formed. <b>Tectonic</b> <b>activities</b> are active on eastern Laurasia as the Cimmerian plate continues {{to collide with}} Laurasia's southern coast, completely closing the Paleo-Tethys Ocean. A subduction zone {{on the coast of}} western North America continues to create the Ancestral Rocky Mountains.|$|R

It occurs {{in the form of a}} successive, {{predominantly}} brown and brownish grey oil layers between pyroclastic outcrops. Himmetoğlu oil shale basin is of Neogene age. Volcanism and <b>tectonic</b> <b>activities</b> had considerable influences on the environmental conditions during the deposition period.|$|R
50|$|Lake Gosiute {{began to}} fill the Red Desert {{for the first time}} in the early Eocene Epoch. Subsequent climate and <b>tectonic</b> <b>activities</b> during the lake's {{lifespan}} (four million years) saw repeated patterns of rising and falling water levels.

40|$|The Perth Basin {{is one of}} {{the major}} tectonic {{structures}} along the western continental margin of Australia and was initially formed through the rifting and break-up of the Indian and Australian plates. The severe tectonic movements accompanied and occurred after the break-up are responsible for the most structural elements and for the distribution of pore pressure in the basin. Investigations on the well log data from the Perth Basin have identified shale intervals which are characterised as overpressured in some parts of the basin, whereas similar shale intervals found to be normally pressured in other parts of the basin. The phenomena of overpressure have frequently been reported while drilling the same intervals. Based on this research, sections with overpressure were observed in the majority of the wells in the basal section of the Kockatea shale where there were less <b>tectonic</b> <b>activities</b> have been recorded. Normal pore pressure was observed in shallower wells in the Kockatea shales which were located within uplifted sections that were more tectonically active areas. Based on the results of this research, the pore pressure distribution in the Kockatea Shale varied significantly from one part of the Perth Basin to another as a result of compressive tectonic stress. Compressional <b>tectonic</b> <b>activities</b> either induced fracturing in shallower localities (e. g. Beagle Ridge, Cadda Terrace and the adjacent terraces) or removed part of the Kockatea Shale as a result of faulting resulting in overpressures being released. Regions with less intensity of the <b>tectonic</b> <b>activities</b> showed an increase in pressure gradients as approaching away from the centre of uplift...|$|R
30|$|Paleo {{oil and gas}} pools, {{after being}} formed, tend to change with time. The {{occurrence}} of later <b>tectonic</b> <b>activities</b> may cause the trap to change in form or even be damaged, leading to release and re-migration of hydrocarbon. Accurate characterization of the hydrocarbon adjustment pathway is helpful for tracking the secondary oil and gas pools. This process requires the analysis of structural form during the adjustment period.|$|R
