5|$|When Philip of Ibelin died, the High Court {{appointed}} his brother, John of Ibelin, as bailli {{without consulting}} the emperor or Alice. Frederick departed for Cyprus, landing at Limassol on 21 July 1228. Upon arriving, he ordered John of Ibelin {{to account for}} the administration of the revenue of Cyprus during his and his brother's time, but John refused, stating that the revenue had been paid <b>to</b> <b>Alice.</b> Frederick dismissed Ibelin and forced Henry I of Cyprus to swear fealty to him. He also demanded an oath of fealty from the Cypriot noblemen, but they were only willing to submit to him as their king's overlord, declaring that they only owed fealty <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b> who served as regent to their king. Frederick made Aimery Barlais, Gavin of Chenichy, Aimaury of Beisan, Hugh of Jebail and William of Rivet baillis of Cyprus without Alice's consent before departing for Italy in May 1229. Peter I, Duke of Brittany declared that he wanted to marry Alice, but this was refused on 29 May by Pope Gregory because of consanguinity.|$|E

5|$|Birkin becomes {{accepted}} into the Nonconformist family of Mr Ellerbeck the station master (Jim Carter), with whom he dines on Sundays; the hospitality of the chapel congregation is contrasted against the established church, which has consigned the penniless Birkin {{to sleep in the}} church belfry. Ellerbeck's children eventually persuade Birkin to preach a sermon at a nearby Methodist chapel. Birkin also forms an emotional, albeit unspoken, attachment <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b> Keach (Natasha Richardson), the young wife of the vicar. The vicar himself (Patrick Malahide) is portrayed unsympathetically as an obstruction to the work in the church, viewing the medieval painting as symptomatic of the superstition prevalent in the community.|$|E
5|$|Carl Eric Wickman {{was born}} in Sweden in 1887. In 1905 {{he moved to the}} United States where he was working in a mine as a drill {{operator}} in Alice, Minnesota, until he was laid off in 1914. In the same year, he became a Hupmobile salesman in Hibbing, Minnesota. He proved unable to sell the car. In 1914, using his remaining vehicle, a 7-passenger car, he began a bus service with Andy (Bus Andy) Anderson and C.A.A. (Arvid) Heed, by transporting iron ore miners from Hibbing <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b> (known for its saloons) at 15 cents a ride.|$|E
5|$|Robert was {{probably}} one of the sons of Gilbert de Gant, who is mentioned in the Domesday Book. Gilbert was from Flanders and came to England during 1069. Gilbert, who died around 1095, was married <b>to</b> <b>Alice,</b> daughter of Hugh de Montfort. Robert's conjectured siblings were Emma– wife of Alan de Percy, Hugh de Montfort-sur-Risle, Gilbert de Gant– who died before his father, and Walter de Gant. If Robert was a son of Gilbert, he was a younger son, probably the youngest of the four brothers, and probably was born sometime around 1085, as his supposed parents married about 1075 and there were older siblings. Robert is often confused in the historical records with another Robert, son of Walter. Robert {{was probably}} also the uncle of Gilbert de Gant, later Earl of Lincoln.|$|E
