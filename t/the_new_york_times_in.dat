5|$|Poland, {{home of the}} world's largest Jewish {{community}} {{before the}} war, lost 3,300,000 (90percent) of its Jewish population. Although the Germans rigorously imposed {{the death penalty for}} hiding Jews, some Poles hid Jews (saving their lives) despite the risk to themselves and their families. Although reports of the Holocaust had reached Western leaders, public awareness in the United States and other democracies of the mass murder of Jews in Poland was low at the time; the first references in <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times,</b> <b>in</b> 1942, were unconfirmed reports rather than front-page news.|$|E

Despite a troubled script, Parker's rap performance earned comparisons to Will Smith from Nathan Lee of <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times.</b> <b>In</b> 2007, he had a small role in Pride, about an African American swim team.

5|$|In Janáček's 70th year (1924) his {{biography}} {{was published by}} Max Brod, and he was interviewed by Olin Downes for <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times.</b> <b>In</b> 1925 he retired from teaching, but continued composing and was awarded the first honorary doctorate to be given by Masaryk University in Brno. In the spring of 1926 he created his Sinfonietta, a monumental orchestral work, which rapidly gained wide critical acclaim. In the same year he went to England {{at the invitation of}} Rosa Newmarch. A number of his works were performed in London, including his first string quartet, the wind sextet Youth, and his violin sonata. Shortly after, and still in 1926, he started to compose a setting to an Old Church Slavonic text. The result was the large-scale orchestral Glagolitic Mass. Janáček was an atheist, and critical of the organised Church, but religious themes appear frequently in his work. The Glagolitic Mass was partly inspired by the suggestion by a clerical friend, and partly by Janáček's wish to celebrate the anniversary of Czechoslovak independence.|$|E

5|$|There are varying {{accounts}} {{about how}} much danger the production encountered during the 1932–33 winter season.

A report by <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>in</b> February 1933 also claimed the Nanuk was locked in sea ice between Teller and Barrow.
