5000|$|<b>El</b> <b>Tiempo</b> was a Ladino {{language}} newspaper {{published in}} Constantinople/Istanbul {{in the years}} 1872-1930. <b>El</b> <b>Tiempo</b> was the first Ladino newspaper published in Istanbul. It was also the longest-running Ladino newspaper in the city. It was published as a daily newspaper, later being converted into a biweekly. From July 1882 to 1930 <b>El</b> <b>Tiempo</b> was published three times a week. Politically, the newspaper supported the positions of Turkish reformers.|$|R
50|$|Once Zionism {{emerged as}} a {{political}} force, <b>El</b> <b>Tiempo</b> responded by proclaiming its loyalty to the Ottoman Empire. Within the Ladino Jewish community in Constantinople/Istanbul (where Zionist ideas were beginning to strike roots) <b>El</b> <b>Tiempo</b> argued that Ottoman Jews ought to remain Ottoman nationals. There was a brief period (prior to 1910) during which discussions were ongoing between the World Zionist Organization and <b>El</b> <b>Tiempo,</b> but any re-evaluation of Zionism on behalf of <b>El</b> <b>Tiempo</b> was sealed as David Fresco aligned with prominent anti-Zionist Rabbi Chaim Nahum. Fresco argued in favour of assimilation of the Ottoman Jews into Turkish society {{and the promotion of}} the use of Turkish language.|$|R
