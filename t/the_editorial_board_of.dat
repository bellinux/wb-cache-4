5|$|His exile over, in 1900 {{he moved}} to Western Europe, where he joined <b>the</b> <b>editorial</b> <b>board</b> <b>of</b> Iskra, the {{publication}} of the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). Iskras base was moved from Munich to London and then to Geneva, each time accompanied by Lenin. At the party's second congress, held in London in 1902, a major schism erupted between Lenin and his supporters (the Bolsheviks) and Julius Martov and his supporters (the Mensheviks); Lenin emphasised a strongly centralised party controlled largely by the leadership, whereas Martov accepted a wider party with more independence of thought. Lenin returned to Russia briefly during the Revolution of 1905, but fled again when the Tsarist authorities defeated the revolutionary forces and cracked down on dissent.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, {{when the}} new {{communist}} regime outlawed the Greek-Catholic Church and forcibly merged it into the Orthodox Church, Agârbiceanu refused to join the latter denomination, thus setting himself up against the authorities.

In 1953, after a five-year marginalization for his refusal to turn Orthodox, Agârbiceanu joined <b>the</b> <b>editorial</b> <b>board</b> <b>of</b> Anatol E. Baconsky's semi-official literary magazine, Steaua. He was granted the Order of Labor the following year, and promoted to titular member of the Academy in 1955.

5|$|In {{response}} to the revolution of 1905, Tsar Nicholas II accepted a series of liberal reforms in his October Manifesto, after which Lenin felt it safe to return to St. Petersburg. Joining <b>the</b> <b>editorial</b> <b>board</b> <b>of</b> Novaya Zhizn ("New Life"), a radical legal newspaper run by Maria Andreyeva, he used it to discuss issues facing the RSDLP. He encouraged the party to seek out a much wider membership, and advocated the continual escalation of violent confrontation, believing both to be necessary for a successful revolution. Recognising that membership fees and donations from a few wealthy sympathisers were insufficient to finance the Bolsheviks' activities, Lenin endorsed the idea of robbing post offices, railway stations, trains, and banks. Under the lead of Leonid Krasin, a group of Bolsheviks began carrying out such criminal actions, the best known taking place in June 1907, {{when a group of}} Bolsheviks acting under the leadership of Joseph Stalin committed an armed robbery of the State Bank in Tiflis, Georgia.|$|E

5|$|Lenin had {{not wanted}} {{to return to the}} Russian Empire, fearing arrest. He changed his opinion when Tsar Nicholas II {{accepted}} a series of liberal reforms in his October Manifesto, with Lenin believing that these would protect him from the Okhrana. Thus, Lenin and his wife returned to Russia in cognito via Sweden and Finland, moving between different safe houses in St. Petersburg, from which he monitored events and wrote up many of his ideas on the progress of the revolution. He was invited to join <b>the</b> <b>editorial</b> <b>board</b> <b>of</b> Novaya Zhizn (New Life), a radical legal newspaper run by Maxim Gorky's wife M.F. Andreyeva, and used this as a vehicle to discuss issues facing the RSDLP. He encouraged the party to seek out a much wider membership, and also advocated the continual escalation of violent confrontation, believing both to be necessary for the revolution to succeed. However, after the armed Moscow Uprising failed, Lenin began to urge the party to stand in elections for the Duma, believing that this would raise the party's public profile. At a Bolshevik Congress in Tampere, Finland, Lenin first met young Bolshevik Joseph Stalin. He also changed his mind {{on the issue of the}} Mensheviks, and began calling for reconciliation between the party's two factions. Members of both groups met at the 4th Party Congress in Stockholm, Sweden in April 1906 where the Mensheviks condemned Lenin for supporting bank robberies and encouraging violence. The Congress resulted in the election of a new Central Committee comprising 7 Mensheviks and 3 Bolsheviks.|$|E
