I then threw out some allusion to the rock temples of Yucatan, which he instantly picked up and enlarged upon. He spoke of ancient Peruvian civilization, and I kept well abreast of him.

While you might want {{to increase the amount of}} time your family spends together, the hands on the clock move very quickly and make it difficult to accomplish. How do you make the most of your time at home together? Strong families make it a priority to spend time together. Whether it is working on household chores, running errands, or playing a game, they show commitment to each other. When you or your partner spend many hours of the week away from home, it is often more difficult to enjoy time at home because of the pressure to accomplish everything that didn’t get done during the week. Research indicates that the partner left at home with children has a more difficult task than those without children. Juggling the multiple schedules and individual needs tends to create greater challenges. Children may feel neglected or disappointed when a parent can’t participate in their daily activities.

3000|$|Some {{administrators and}} clinicians {{discussed}} ways to treat group traits as targets for clinical intervention. One administrator explained the medicalization of cultural {{knowledge in the}} hospital: “Cultural competence means the ability to understand [the] different cultures of people. In nursing, we have meetings on different cultures. Staff <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> ‘That’s <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do with Chinese. With Koreans you do this.’ Things like that {{so that we can}} learn. In our orientation time, we have a little <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> culture.” Another administrator explained interventions by group: “Hispanic people have kind of personality types or needs that needs to be met. For example, they want to feel like when they come to see anybody, it feels like family. It feels like they can trust.” Three clinicians also defined cultural competence through group traits related to clinical practice. For one clinician, traits informed communication: “I had this patient who was from the Asian culture. He had a lot of problem with eye contact. What I would do is that I would not make that much eye contact with that particular patient until he became more comfortable.” For another clinician, traits determined family involvement: “Most of the Asian cultures have nuclear families. They want the family to be included. Mothers and fathers, you need to speak to them first.” For the third clinician, traits influenced treatment: “In the African-American community, it’s a shame to have a mental illness. The best kind of treatment for an African American is called brief therapy. Make it quick, give them their medication.
