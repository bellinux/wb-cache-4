5|$|Alexander H. Smith {{described}} a variety, Calbovista subsculpta var. fumosa, in 1965, {{based on a}} collection he made in Kaniksu National Forest (northeastern Washington) in 1964. This variety, known only from the type locality, differs from the nominate variety in its grayish outer peridium and minute scales. Because {{it was based on}} an invalid genus, it too was invalid; it was later published correctly in 2012 with <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>name</b> and authority Calbovista subsculpta var. fumosa A.H.Sm. ex J.C.Coetzee & A.E.van Wyk.|$|E
5|$|A naming {{exception}} was Huge Viking, {{which was used}} for a Boeing 747. Huge was the quickest being in Norse mythology, but the name also played on the words English meaning. SAS reuses the names from retired aircraft, except for those of crashed aircraft. Because of oversights, the name Agnar and Rane have however been reused. A similar naming convention, albeit using <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>name</b> of kings, was used by Braathens SAFE of Norway and Loftleiðir of Iceland. As Carlzon was opposed to the Viking references, he also proposed that the names be abolished. The executive management reverted its decision following massive protests from within the airline. Female aircraft names were introduced by Scanair in 1980, who gave them to all their Douglas DC-8s. SAS followed suit in 1989, when the entire series of Boeing 767 were named for prominent female Vikings. Scandinavian letters were introduced from the 1990s. SAS Commuter's Norwegian Fokker 50 aircraft were given names for places in Norway, such as Lakselv.|$|E
5|$|In 1847, Queen Victoria issued new {{statutes}} eliminating all {{references to}} an exclusively military Order. As well as removing the word 'Military' from <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>name</b> of the Order, this {{opened up the}} grades of Knight Commander and Companion to civil appointments, and the Military and Civil Divisions of the Order were established. New numerical limits were imposed, and the opportunity also taken to regularise the 1815 expansion of the Order. The 1847 statutes also abolished all the medieval ritual, however they did introduce a formal Investiture ceremony, conducted by the Sovereign wearing the Mantle and insignia of the Order, attended by the Officers and as many GCBs as possible, in their Mantles.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, Congress {{changed the}} name of the Washington National Airport to the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport with the law specifying that no money be spent to {{implement}} the name change. As a result, WMATA did not change {{the name of the}} National Airport Station (which never included <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>name</b> of the airport). In response to repeated inquiries from Republican congressmen that the station be renamed, WMATA stated that stations are renamed only {{at the request of the}} local jurisdiction. Because both Arlington County and the District of Columbia were controlled by Democrats, the name change was blocked. Not until 2001 did Congress make changing the station's name a condition of further federal funding.|$|E

On the reverse of the flag, the center contains the symbol of the armed forces, which is a red star surrounded by a wreath of oak and laurel. Above the symbol is the phrase ЗА НАШУ РАДЗІМУ ("For our Motherland"), while below is <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>name</b> of the military unit.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the early}} Māori names were {{replaced}} by Europeans during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Government amendments in 1894 {{and the establishment of}} the New Zealand Geographic Board in the mid-1940s led to the encouragement of original Māori names, although incorrect spellings and anglicised pronunciations persisted. Many names now have alternative or dual English and Māori names or, in a few rare cases, dual Māori names or dual English names. Most names have never been made official, but if they are mentioned in authoritative publications they are considered recorded names. Colloquial names in New Zealand result from an ironic view of the place's entertainment value, or plays on advertising mottos, or are shortened versions of <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>name.</b> Some places tried to capitalise on the success of The Lord of the Rings films by linking themselves to the movies.|$|E
