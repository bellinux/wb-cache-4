IFRS 7 aims to establish a good international standard for disclosures about financial instruments.

The thesis is based on a qualitative method and the conclusion of the thesis is that the life insurance companies find it tricky to decide how <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>shall</b> be designed in compliance with IFRS 7. Almost all information needed already exists. The problem rather relates to the design of <b>the</b> <b>accounting.</b> Further more, <b>the</b> companies read the recommendation with different eyes and define different users of annual reports, that creates different interpretations. Balance- and income statements will be less affected of IFRS 7, while notes and disclosures will grow. Finally, the attitudes towards IFRS vary alot between life insurance companies...|$|R

60|$|Dr. Vehse gives a {{pleasant}} {{glimpse of the}} way of life of our dukes in Zell. “When the trumpeter on the tower has blown,” Duke Christian orders—viz. at nine o’clock in the morning, and four in the evening, every one must be present at meals, and those who are not must go without. None of the servants, unless it be a knave who has been ordered to ride out, shall eat or drink in the kitchen or cellar; or, without special leave, fodder his horses at the prince’s cost. When the meal is served in the Court-room, a page shall go round and bid every one be quiet and orderly, forbidding all cursing, swearing, and rudeness; all throwing about of bread, bones, or roast, or pocketing of the same. Every morning, at seven, the squires shall have their morning soup, along with which, and dinner, they shall be served with their under-drink—every morning, except Friday morning, when there was sermon, and no drink. Every evening they shall have their beer, and at night their sleep-drink. The butler is especially warned not to allow noble or simple to go into the cellar: wine shall only be served at the prince’s or councillor’s table; and every Monday, the honest old Duke Christian ordains <b>the</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>shall</b> be ready, and the expenses in the kitchen, the wine and beer cellar, the bakehouse and stable, made out.|$|R
40|$|A law {{shall not}} violate its sources, {{especially}} if the sources {{are not subject to}} being overruled or ignored. However, one of the essential Islamic objectives is preserving the wealth “property. ” This preservation requires protecting wealth from being acquired in illegitimate way, which will prevent the owners from controlling and enjoying their wealth. Islam protects true owners themselves from getting harmed or facing suffering caused by engaging in a transaction that involved their property. In making the law, Islamic scholars contend that any deliberate act that creates harm or makes someone suffer is “strictly prohibited” and must be rebuked. This legal rule is founded on a statement from the prophet “PBUH” who said, “There is no injury nor return of injury. ” The law of unclaimed <b>accounts</b> states <b>the</b> following: if <b>the</b> current <b>account</b> lays dormant for a five-year period, with no transactions by the customer or his authorized agent, <b>the</b> <b>account</b> <b>shall</b> be considered unclaimed and the bank should transfer the balance thereof to a pooled Suspense Account reserved for these <b>accounts</b> inside <b>the</b> bank. This law of unclaimed money has given the Saudi banks unjust power over their customers, causing difficulty for heirs and third-party creditors trying to retrieve their wealth. This law should be reformed by adopting a fair law to remove this harmful practice and restore the rightful owners’ rights to control and enjoy their wealth. This law also violates some major principles of Islam, such as the inheritance law. As a result, this law violates the two primary sources of Islam, so it is unconstitutional...|$|R

25|$|Subtitle E {{concerns}} jumbo rules concerning escrow {{and settlement}} procedures {{for people who}} are in trouble repaying their mortgages, and also makes amendments to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974. In general, in connection with a residential mortgage there should be an established escrow or impound <b>account</b> for <b>the</b> payment of taxes, hazard insurance, and (if applicable) flood insurance, mortgage insurance, ground rents, and any other required periodic payments.

40|$|However, under {{paragraph}} 26 of Statement 13, {{if certain}} criteria are met, <b>the</b> lessor <b>shall</b> <b>account</b> {{for real estate}} leases either as a sales-type lease or as a direct financing lease as appropriate under subparagraphs 6 (b) (i) and 6 (b) (ii) of Statement 13; otherwise, <b>the</b> lease <b>shall</b> be <b>accounted</b> for as an operating lease. Because leveraged leases are described only in subparagraph 6 (b) (iii) {{and not in the}} subparagraphs cited above, some believe paragraph 26 precludes real estate leases from being classified as leveraged leases. Paragraph 34 of Statement 13 states that, if certain criteria are met, <b>the</b> purchaser-lessor <b>shall</b> <b>account</b> for sale-leaseback transactions as a purchase and a direct financing lease; otherwise, <b>the</b> lease <b>shall</b> be <b>accounted</b> for as a purchase and an operating lease. Because direct financing leases and leveraged leases are distinct classifications in paragraph 6, some believe that paragraph 34 precludes sale-leaseback transactions from being classified as leveraged leases.
