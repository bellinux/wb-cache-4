5|$|Development {{began in}} 2008, {{simultaneous}} to Dominion of the Dark Djinn. The game's animated sequences were produced by Studio Ghibli, while the original score was co-composed by Joe Hisaishi. The art style was also inspired by Studio Ghibli's other productions. The character development of Oliver {{was a large}} focus of the game, intending to make children empathize with the character and for adults to relive their adolescence. The developers used {{the power of the}} PlayStation 3 <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>full</b> potential to render the world with great detail not possible in Dominion of the Dark Djinn.|$|E
5|$|Gisborough Priory is characterised {{by a few}} {{highly visible}} remains. The priory church survives in a fragmentary state, {{dominated}} by the east wall of the presbytery that stands <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>full</b> height. Several of the priory church's column bases can also be seen, as can a number of excavated graves within the presbytery. Elsewhere on the site, {{the outline of the}} cloister is visible but is largely unexcavated, while the ruins of the west (or cellarer's) range constitutes the largest area of other remains above ground. A ruined gatehouse and a still-intact dovecote (the latter off-limits to visitors) stand on the western edges of the site.|$|E
5|$|In {{the medieval}} Japan, heian gentleman {{were not very}} {{interested}} in a woman's physical beauty and rarely {{had an opportunity to}} see it. The only physical attribute of interest was a woman's hair, which had to be thick and longer than she was tall. The fascination with long hair was one reason why a woman's becoming a nun was regarded with such seriousness— it could never again grow <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>full</b> length. This explains why Genji refuses to let Murasaki (his de facto wife in the classical Japanese novel The Tale of Genji) take the tonsure when she is ill.|$|E

5|$|The Borders Railway {{bill was}} debated in September 2005 and a motion {{supporting}} {{it was passed}} with 102 in favour, none against and one abstention. On 9 May 2006, the bill committee published its final report supporting the project with two recommendations: a station had to be provided at Stow and the line had to be completed <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>full</b> extent, i.e. as far as Tweedbank. These recommendations were accepted by the Scottish Parliament in the final debate on the bill on 14 June 2006. The bill was carried by 114 votes to one.|$|E
5|$|The {{animated}} sequences for Dominion of the Dark Djinn and Wrath of the White Witch {{were produced}} by Studio Ghibli, {{and the original}} score was composed by Joe Hisaishi and Rei Kondoh. The artwork was also greatly inspired by Studio Ghibli's other productions. The character development—particularly that of Oliver and his friends—was a large focus of development, and was intended to make children empathize with the characters and for adults to relive their adolescence. The developers chose to initially develop for the Nintendo DS due to its suitability for gameplay, and later used {{the power of the}} PlayStation 3 <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>full</b> potential to render the world with great detail.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the above}} formulations, most silver {{compounds}} have significant covalent character {{due to the}} small size and high first ionization energy (730.8kJ/mol) of silver. Furthermore, silver's Pauling electronegativity of 1.93 is {{higher than that of}} lead (1.87), and its electron affinity of 125.6kJ/mol is much higher than that of hydrogen (72.8kJ/mol) and not much less than that of oxygen (141.0kJ/mol). Due <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>full</b> d-subshell, silver in its main +1 oxidation state exhibits relatively few properties of the transition metals proper from groups 4 to 10, forming rather unstable organometallic compounds, forming linear complexes showing very low coordination numbers like 2, and forming an amphoteric oxide as well as Zintl phases like the post-transition metals. Unlike the preceding transition metals, the +1 oxidation state of silver is stable {{even in the absence of}} π-acceptor ligands.|$|E

5|$|For Dominion of the Dark Djinn, the {{development}} team {{found that the}} Nintendo DS was best suited to the game's development. Alongside the launch of Dominion of the Dark Djinn on December 9, 2010, Level-5 also launched {{the first chapter of}} Hotroit Stories, titled , for mobile devices via the Roid service. Wrath of the White Witch was developed for the PlayStation 3. The team planned to bring the game to the console from the beginning of development, but opted to work on the DS version of the game beforehand due to the larger number of DS users in Japan at the time. The team found they could render the game world with great detail, using the hardware <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>full</b> potential to present the animation, world and music. Hino felt that the PlayStation 3 version allowed the game's music to accompany the imagery, which was not possible on the DS version.|$|E
5|$|From series {{three of}} Robot Wars, the Gauntlet and Trial stages of each heat were dropped, {{with the whole}} of the main {{competition}} formed around direct combat. Razer's first battle of the series was against Backstabber. Scott lowered Razer's arm into an extrusion on Backstabber, and Lewis pushed their opponent into the 'pit', an open hole in the arena floor. In the second round, despite causing damage to Aggrobot, Razer lost due to a mechanical failure: the valve which controls the direction of hydraulic fluid in the arm jammed, causing Razer's arm to raise <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>full</b> height and refuse to lower. With its rear wheels off the ground, Razer was weaponless and immobile, and eliminated early from the main competition once more. Outside of the main UK championship, Razer won the concurrent Pinball Warrior Tournament side event and retained the Best Design award.|$|E
5|$|Georgia coach Herman Stegeman, in {{the section}} on Southern {{football}} in Spalding's football guide, wrote that Vanderbilt had a good year {{but was unable to}} play up <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>full</b> capabilities and the Commodores should prepare for a fine season the next year. For Stegeman, the contest for the theoretical title of greatest Southern team in 1921 was between Centre, Georgia Tech, and Georgia. Clyde Berryman retroactively listed Vanderbilt as national champion. Lynn Bomar at fullback, Pos Elam at tackle, and Thomas Ryan at end were listed on Walter Camp's list of notable players. Bomar, Elam, Ryan, Tot McCullough, Alf Sharpe, and Pink Wade all made an All-Southern team although, according to the yearbook, Tom Ryan was the only player in the group to appear on an All-Southern team.|$|E

5|$|No.6 Squadron's Lincolns were {{replaced}} with Canberra jet bombers in early 1955, and the unit became operational with these aircraft on 11 July. As {{part of the}} transition to the Canberra, the squadron's remaining aircrew were posted to the Lincoln Conversion Flight, which continued to support No.1 Squadron in Malaya, and replacement aircrew were posted from No.2 Squadron. The squadron suffered a number of accidents during the next two years in which several Canberras were damaged as a result of defects with the aircraft. No.6 Squadron continued its training duties with the new aircraft; these included regular deployments to Darwin in the Northern Territory to participate in air defence exercises as well as training flights to Malaya and New Zealand. In early 1967 most of the squadron's personnel were transferred to No.2 Squadron to bring that unit up <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>full</b> strength before it deployed to South Vietnam as part of Australia's commitment to the Vietnam War. From this point onwards, No.6 Squadron was heavily engaged in training aircrew for service in South Vietnam.|$|E

By March 2013, two sections of the antenna had been installed. The spire's completion was scheduled for April 29, 2013, but bad weather delayed the delivery of the final pieces. On May 10, 2013, the final piece of the spire was lifted to the top of One World Trade Center, bringing the tower <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>full</b> height of , and making it the fourth-tallest building in the world. In subsequent months, the exterior elevator shaft was removed; the podium glass, interior decorations, and other finishings were being installed; and installation of concrete flooring and steel fittings was completed.|$|E

5|$|Seydlitz was {{generally}} admired for the superb coup d'œil {{that allowed him}} to utilize the cavalry <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>full</b> potential. His 19th century biographer, K. A. Varnhagen von Ense, related that Seydlitz lived above all for the service, and promoted the training of his hussars before all else. According to Anton König, who wrote in 17801790, Seydlitz performed best at taverns and excelled in practical jokes: one would gather that Seydlitz was a drunkard, a rake, and a savage, but another of his biographers, Bernhard von Poten, cited conflicting descriptions offered by Seydlitz's contemporaries, particularly Warnery, as more accurate. Nevertheless, there is some evidence to support König's assertion, at least of Seydlitz's excesses: Seydlitz was no doubt dependent upon his tobacco and had been since his teenage years, although he smoked a pipe rather than using snuff, as many officers did; he was indeed reckless, as his career testified; he enjoyed the company of women; and Seydlitz indeed suffered from recurring illness.|$|E
5|$|The pupal {{transformation}} into a butterfly through metamorphosis has held great appeal to mankind. To transform from the miniature wings {{visible on the}} outside of the pupa into large structures usable for flight, the pupal wings undergo rapid mitosis and absorb a great deal of nutrients. If one wing is surgically removed early on, the other three will grow to a larger size. In the pupa, the wing forms a structure that becomes compressed from top to bottom and pleated from proximal to distal ends as it grows, so that it can rapidly be unfolded <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>full</b> adult size. Several boundaries seen in the adult colour pattern are marked by changes in the expression of particular transcription factors in the early pupa.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} the priory church are {{dominated}} by the eastern gable wall of the presbytery that still stands <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>full</b> height. Its great east window is {{regarded as one of}} the finest examples of late-13th-century church architecture. The design is so close to that of the eastern arm of Ripon Cathedral, which was built around the same time, that it is thought to have been modelled on Ripon's design. The window's tracery has disappeared, as has its sill, but from the stubs and surviving fragments it can be deduced that it had seven major lights (the glazed openings in the window). At its centre was a great circle of tracery filled with trefoiled lights. The main gable of the east wall is flanked by massive buttresses capped with gables and octagonal pinnacles. A similar pair of pinnacles top the main gable, flanking a window of unusual design; a bracket projects from the lower lobe to support a statue (no longer present), possibly of the Virgin Mary, to whom the priory was dedicated.|$|E

5|$|An early {{algorithmic}} use of pseudoforests {{involves the}} network simplex algorithm and {{its application to}} generalized flow problems modeling the conversion between commodities of different types. In these problems, one is given as input a flow network in which the vertices model each commodity and the edges model allowable conversions between one commodity and another. Each edge is marked with a capacity (how much of a commodity can be converted per unit time), a flow multiplier (the conversion rate between commodities), and a cost (how much loss or, if negative, profit is incurred per unit of conversion). The task is {{to determine how much}} of each commodity to convert via each edge of the flow network, in order to minimize cost or maximize profit, while obeying the capacity constraints and not allowing commodities of any type to accumulate unused. This type of problem can be formulated as a linear program, and solved using the simplex algorithm. The intermediate solutions arising from this algorithm, as well as the eventual optimal solution, have a special structure: each edge in the input network is either unused or used <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>full</b> capacity, except for a subset of the edges, forming a spanning pseudoforest of the input network, for which the flow amounts may lie between zero and the full capacity. In this application, unicyclic graphs are also sometimes called augmented trees and maximal pseudoforests are also sometimes called augmented forests.|$|E
5|$|Hilda instructs Link to {{find and}} rescue the Seven Sages, who have been {{scattered}} across her kingdom, {{in order to gain}} the Triforce of Courage. With help from Ravio's services, Link accomplishes this and returns to Lorule Castle, where he discovers Hilda taking the Triforce of Wisdom from Zelda. Hilda reveals that Lorule fell into ruin after her ancestors destroyed their own Triforce. Deciding that in order to restore her kingdom back to its former glory, she needs Hyrule's Triforce, arranging everything so that Link would bring it to her. Hilda attempts to use Yuga to obtain the Triforce of Courage from Link, but Yuga betrays her and turns her into a painting, stealing the Triforce of Wisdom for himself. With Zelda's help, Link manages to defeat Yuga. He then restores Zelda and Hilda from their paintings. As Hilda feels bitter over her loss, Ravio, who is revealed to be Link's counterpart, convinces her that stealing Hyrule's Triforce isn't the right way to save Lorule, having secretly sought out Link to help her see the light. After Link and Zelda return to Hyrule, they use the power of their Triforce to restore Lorule's Triforce and bring Lorule back <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>full</b> glory. With his quest completed, Link returns the Master Sword to its resting place once more.|$|E
5|$|Rachel is {{the leading}} female character, and tragic heroine of the game. She and her twin sister, Alma, are afflicted with a blood curse that turns humans into fiends. Believing {{that there is no}} cure for their condition, Rachel seeks to kill Alma to redeem her sister's soul. The {{relationship}} between the sisters and the Greater Fiend Doku, who cursed them, serves as a plot device to drive the game forward, with Rachel occasionally needing to be rescued by Ryu. Although not a player-controlled character in Ninja Gaiden, in a few sections of the Ninja Gaiden Sigma remake she is controllable. Two other characters assist the player in the game. Ayane, a young female ninja and one of the DOA regular cast members, acts as a guide throughout Ninja Gaiden by supplying advice and objectives to the player. Muramasa, a bladesmith, has shops scattered throughout the game world where players can purchase useful items and upgrades for Ryu's weapons. Muramasa also gives quests and relates back-stories and other crucial information; for example, he tells Ryu how he can obtain the item required to upgrade his Dragon Sword <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>full</b> potential. Players have the option to customize the appearance of player characters, with selectable costumes for Ryu and hairstyles for Rachel.|$|E
