5|$|Dudley was {{credited}} with discovering that a toxic component of tobacco smoke is carbon monoxide (which poisons the blood by interfering with oxygen's ability to bind to hemoglobin). Dudley rejected the popularly held opinion that cigarette smoke was harmful due to the adulteration of the tobacco, e. g. with opium. His experiments showed the <b>toxic</b> <b>agent</b> to be carbon monoxide, resulting alike from cigarette, pipe, or cigar.|$|E
5|$|Other {{metabolites}} {{isolated from}} different species include dibenzonaphtyridinone alkaloids, prenylated phenols, benzofurans, chromenes, natural rubber (polyisoprene), sterols, and the sugar alcohol volemitol. Among toxic substances, Lactarius turpis contains the mutagenic alkaloid necatorin, {{and the small}} compound cycloprop-2-ene carboxylic acid {{has been identified as}} the <b>toxic</b> <b>agent</b> in Russula subnigricans. Some secondary metabolites showed antibiotic properties in laboratory tests. An ethanolic extract of Russula delica was antibacterial, and a lectin from Russula rosea showed antitumor activity.|$|E

To you, my dear Summerlee, belongs the honour--posthumous, alas, but none the less unique--of having given {{a name to}} the universal destroyer, the Great Gardener's disinfectant. The symptoms of daturon, then, may be taken to be such as I indicate. That it will involve the whole world and that no life can possibly remain behind {{seems to me to}} be certain, since ether is a universal medium. Up to now it has been capricious in the places which it has attacked, but the difference is only a matter of a few hours, and it is like an advancing tide which covers one strip of sand and then another, running hither and thither in irregular streams, until at last it has submerged it all. There are laws at work in connection with the action and distribution of daturon which would have been of deep interest had the time at our disposal permitted us to study them. So far as I can trace them"--here he glanced over his telegrams--"the less developed races have been the first to respond to its influence. There are deplorable accounts from Africa, and the Australian aborigines appear to have been already exterminated. The Northern races have as yet shown greater resisting power than the Southern.

50|$|Toxic {{leukoencephalopathy}} or toxic spongiform leukoencephalopathy {{is a rare}} {{condition that}} is characterized by progressive damage (-pathy) to white matter (-leuko-) in the brain (-encephalo-), particularly myelin, due to causes such as exposure to drugs of abuse, environmental toxins, or chemotherapeutic drugs. The prevalence of this disease is infrequent and often goes unreported, especially in cases resulting from drug abuse. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a popular method to study and diagnose the disease. However, even with technological advances, the exact mechanism and underlying pathophysiology of toxic leukoencephalopathy remains unknown and is thought to vary between sources of toxicity. The clinical severity of toxic leukoencephalopathy also varies among patients, exposure time, and concentration and purity of the <b>toxic</b> <b>agent.</b> Some reversibility of the condition has been seen in many cases when the <b>toxic</b> <b>agent</b> is removed.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} whether {{the lack of}} knowledge of <b>toxic</b> <b>agents</b> in households is a risk factor for individual unintentional childhood poisoning. Methods: The case group (n = 25) was composed of caregivers of children under 60 months of age who underwent accidental oral poisoning and were treated at two reference hospitals in Porto Alegre, southern Brazil, and recorded in the Toxicology Information Center database. The control group (n = 25) was composed of caregivers of children matched for sex, age, and presence in their homes of the same <b>toxic</b> <b>agents</b> found in the case group, who sought emergency medical care at the same hospitals, but for other reasons. A structured questionnaire was administered to verify the following questions: sociodemographic data, clinical history, behavioral antecedents of caregivers, storage of <b>toxic</b> <b>agents,</b> history of previous poisoning accidents. Results: The childrenâs mean age was 31. 8 months (Â± 0. 97) and mean height was 93 cm (Â± 11). Families, in both groups, were aware of the <b>toxic</b> action of <b>agents</b> available in their homes; however, caregivers in the control group were twice as likely to have such knowledge compared to the case group. Distraction was 15 times more likely to occur among caregivers of children who underwent poisoning compared to the control group. Storage of <b>toxic</b> <b>agents</b> below 150 cm was approximately 17 times more likely to occur in the group of children who underwent poisoning compared to children in the control group. Conclusions: Lack of knowledge of the <b>toxic</b> action of <b>agents</b> stored in households is not a risk factor for childhood poisoning. The attributable risks described in this study indicated that the elimination of other factors, such as distraction and storage below 150 cm, would lead to the prevention of 13 and 19 % of poisonings in childhood, respectively...|$|R

30|$|Therefore, it can {{be assumed}} {{that the amount of}} CHO present in the {{neuronal}} plasma membrane, and not only its plasma levels, {{may play a role in}} the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases [6]. In fact, experimental data support the idea that an optimal amount of CHO in cell membranes is necessary to create a protective barrier against <b>toxic</b> <b>agents.</b> A reduced amount of cellular CHO in the plasma membrane alters this protective barrier, reducing the protection against <b>toxic</b> <b>agents,</b> including the Î²-amyloid protein [7]. Interestingly, neurons in the cerebral cortex of transgenic AD mice contain less CHO in the plasma membrane than those from wild-type mice [8].|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} new {{chemicals}} that are being synthesized each year has been steadily increasing. While chemicals are of immense benefit to mankind, {{many of them have}} a significant negative impact, primarily owing to their inherent chemistry and toxicity, on the environment as well as human health. In addition to chemical exposures, human exposures to numerous non-chemical <b>toxic</b> <b>agents</b> take place in the environment and workplace. Given that human exposure to <b>toxic</b> <b>agents</b> is often unavoidable and many of these agents are found to have detrimental human health effects, it is important to develop strategies to prevent the adverse health effects associated with toxic exposures. Early detection of adverse health effects as well as a clear understanding of the mechanisms, especially at the molecular level, underlying these effects are key elements in preventing the adverse health effects associated with human exposure to <b>toxic</b> <b>agents.</b> Recent developments in genomics, especially transcriptomics, have prompted investigations into this important area of toxicology. Previous studies conducted in our laboratory and elsewhere have demonstrated the potential application of blood gene expression profiling as a sensitive, mechanistically relevant and practical surrogate approach for the early detection of adverse health effects associated with exposure to <b>toxic</b> <b>agents.</b> The advantages of blood gene expression profiling as a surrogate approach to detect early target organ toxicity and the molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity are illustrated and discussed using recent studies on hepatotoxicity and pulmonary toxicity. Furthermore, the important challenges this emerging field in toxicology faces are presented in this review article.
