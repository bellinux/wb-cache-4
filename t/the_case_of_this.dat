25|$|Prominent in this {{property}} is the used of a chamfered front entrance gate. This front {{entrance into the}} property follows the chamfered pattern delineated by the city street {{at the corner of}} Salud and Aurora streets. This designed responded to city ordinances which mandated the incorporation of chamfered corners in urban city lots. This design, along {{with the use of a}} mirror-image chamfered design of the front of the house proper, provided the property with a significant amount of frontal garden space, uncommon in city lots just two blocks from Ponce's main Plaza, as is <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> house.|$|E
25|$|The town lot or plaza was an {{essential}} element of the Spanish colonial town plan. Government offices were designed to face the plaza, and in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> coastal village, the plaza could be fortified as a defensive work. An army encampment was recorded in the Plaza Lot in 1801, and a small wooden fort, including a battery of three cannon, was established from then until 1814. The more substantial Fort San Carlos was built about 1816 to protect the strategic harbor of the Amelia River and Spanish interests in northern Florida. The former Indian campsite became the fort’s parade grounds fronting Estrada Street, which still exists.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the night}} that the woman ritually {{traditionally}} immerses is about 12 days after menstruation began, it often coincides with a woman's ovulation, and thus improves the chances of successful conception if sexual relations occur on that night. However, for certain women, this period extends far past the date of ovulation, and {{in combination with the}} ban on sexual relations during the niddah state, effectively results in the woman being unable to conceive. In <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> effective infertility, rabbis try on a case-by-case basis to relax halakhic strictures in order to facilitate conception. There have been some calls within Orthodox Judaism for the custom to be modified so that the time between the end of menstruation and the end of niddah isn't as long for these women.|$|E

25|$|Band cups have {{a softer}} {{transition}} between {{the body and}} the rim. The decoration {{is in the form of}} a band circling the cup exterior and can frequently be a very elaborate frieze. In <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> form the rim is coated with a glossy black slip. The interior retains the color of the clay, except for a black dot painted in the center. Variations include Droop cups and Kassel cups. Droop cups have black, concave lips and a high foot. As with classic band cups the rim is left black, but the area below it is decorated with ornaments like leaves, buds, palmettes, dots, nimbuses or animals on the cup exterior. Kassel cups are a small form, squatter than other Little Masters cups, and the entire exterior is decorated. As in the case of Droop cups, primarily ornaments are painted. Famous Little Masters are the potters Phrynos, Sokles, Tleson and Ergoteles, the latter two being sons of the potter Nearchos. Hermogenes invented a Little Master variety of skyphos now known as a Hermogenes skyphos. The Phrynos Painter, Taleides Painter, Xenokles Painter and the Group of Rhodes 12264 should also be mentioned here.|$|E

In <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> kind of [...] "dividend" [...] the stockholder does not receive anything or realize any additional value.
