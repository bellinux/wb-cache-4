Cement-formation bonding has not been given special attention so far, in resolving <b>the</b> <b>well</b> <b>integrity</b> problems. A lot of work has been done on other influential factors but this area has not been studied much. With a view to have better understanding about this unexplored area, the experimental setup was developed and several experiments were carried out.

Four different rock types, including sandstone, limestone, chalk and shale were used in experiments. The results obtained from these experiments are discussed in this report. The rock samples were also treated with the drilling fluid to observe the effect of drilling fluids on the bonding strength at cement-formation interface. These results were, then compared to the dry samples of the same rock type and difference between bonding strength was measured. This research work will be helpful in understanding the failure occurred at the cement-formation interface.

40|$|International audienceA new in situ {{experiment}} is proposed for observing and understanding well integrity evolution, potentially due to changes that could occur during a well lifetime.

A small section of a well is reproduced at scale 1 : 1 in the Opalinus Clay formation, representative of a low permeable caprock formation (in Mont Terri Underground Rock Laboratory, Switzerland).

40|$|A problem {{frequently}} {{present in}} {{the oil and gas}} industry is the difficulty of measuring <b>well</b> <b>integrity</b> parameters; particularly, for high-pressure high-temperature wells. For this reason, many relevant parameters, indicators of <b>the</b> <b>integrity</b> of <b>the</b> <b>well,</b> are not directly measured but rather qualitatively estimated by testing response variables, sometimes, unfortunately, without understanding the correlation between the key parameter and the response variable. This research presents methodologies to quantitatively evaluate <b>well</b> <b>integrity</b> in <b>wells</b> with sustained casing pressure (SCP) and gas-lifted wells with faulty gas-lift valves (GLV). The phenomenon occurring during these <b>well</b> <b>integrity</b> issues were modeled using the thermodynamic properties and transport phenomena occurring inside <b>the</b> wellbore. <b>Well</b> <b>integrity</b> denotes <b>the</b> ability to maintain intentional isolation between the formation and <b>the</b> <b>well.</b> <b>The</b> consequences of not detecting and managing <b>well</b> <b>integrity</b> issues can go from the activation of rupture discs to a release of oil/gas, fire and/or explosion during a blowout. For the SCP problem, the developed analytic model has been validated against field data and compared to other numerical models showing similar performance. The SCP model allows for early time data to be used to accurately predict the leak?s severity by estimating a seepage factor, which is akin to permeability, to account for leakage occurring through the imperfect cement sheath. In comparison to current practices, the model shortens the testing time and reduces the risk from gas accumulation and pressure buildup, making it an inherently safer testing procedure. The methodology developed to assess wellbore annular integrity, during gas-lift operations, has been compared to acoustic well sounding (AWS) data from different <b>wells.</b> <b>The</b> model divides <b>the</b> <b>well</b> into small elements and estimates average properties which are used to quantify the total amount of mass and hydrostatic pressure in the annulus at any given time. This methodology accurately tracks casinghead pressure and liquid level increase. When fluid intrusion occurs mostly through the gas-lift valve, the model allows estimating the damage coefficient of the faulty GLV. This coefficient serves as a quantitative parameter for GLV replacement; being independent of acoustic well sounding devices. This methodology has the advantages of easy and quick implementation, being accurate, not requiring any specialized equipment, and providing a quantitative damage parameter for the GLV...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThere is a {{tendency}} for the CCS industry to believe that everything is already known about CO 2 injection <b>wells,</b> based upon <b>the</b> experience of miscible fluid injection {{for the purposes of}} tertiary oil recovery, combined with the general experience of gas re-injection and gas production internationally. In fact, analysis of the technical issues identifies that CO 2 injection wells for sequestration may be more challenging in a number of ways, both in the fluids and pressures they must handle and the long term duration for which full <b>well</b> <b>integrity</b> will be required. <b>Well</b> <b>integrity</b> means <b>the</b> achievement of fluid containment and pressure containment within <b>the</b> <b>well</b> throughout its whole life cycle. The technical challenges of CO 2 injection wells are highly dependent on <b>the</b> individual <b>well</b> design parameters, principally the formation being injected into (saline aquifer versus depleted gas formation) and the quality (impurity levels) found in the CO 2 source gas. These factors will impact the potential corrosion and other material degradation challenges which may threaten <b>the</b> <b>well</b> components including injection tubing, injection casing, cement and packer materials. The long term integrity of these components is critical to the injection phase of the life and the suspension and abandonment phases (depending upon the strategy selected for well abandonment). A key part of the acceptance of CO 2 sequestration as a safe and reliable greenhouse gas control mechanism will be the proof that <b>the</b> <b>well</b> is truly leak-free.

40|$|This thesis {{has been}} based on {{reviewing}} literature on Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes theory of accident analysis and accident investigations of <b>the</b> Macondo <b>well</b> blowout. Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes is commonly known under its name STAMP and is a systemic accident modeling approach. Systemic accident modeling approaches have been developed after the sequential- and epidemiological accident models. In systemic accident models safety is seen as an emergent property. STAMP is based on three basic constructs which are safety constraints, hierarchical safety control structures, and process models. A constraint is the most basic concept of STAMP, thereby moving away from the current risk assessments focus on events. This is underlined by the fact that events leading to losses only occur because safety constraints were not successfully enforced. From systems theory a system is viewed as a hierarchical structure, where each level imposes constraints on the activity on the level below, resulting in higher-level constraints allowing or controlling lower level behavior. Process models show how the controller of a process enforces the required safety constraints, and how the controller receives feedback from the process being controlled. Feedback is a very important aspect of STAMP, as STAMP views systems as interrelated components that are kept in a state of dynamic equilibrium by feedback loops of information and control. Causal analysis based on STAMP (CAST) is a method developed for analyzing accidents and incidents. Risk assessment methods have predominantly been event based, but STAMP wishes to move forward in assessing risks and safety by using the violation of safety constraints as a basis for loss events resulting in accidents and incidents. CAST is a method developed in line with the overall framework of STAMP, and has been the basis for the accident analysis of <b>the</b> Macondo <b>well</b> blowout in this report. On April 20 th 2010 the Deepwater Horizon rig was set to perform a temporary abandonment, which refers to the procedures done after the completion of the drilling of a well in preparation for the drilling rig to abandon <b>the</b> <b>well.</b> During <b>the</b> temporary abandonment the crew on the Deepwater Horizon would check <b>the</b> <b>wells</b> <b>integrity</b> before they abandoned <b>the</b> <b>well</b> site. <b>The</b> <b>wells</b> <b>integrity</b> was tested during the day of April 20 th 2010, and approved at around 8 p. m. The next stage of the temporary abandonment was to displace the drilling mud in the riser connected with the wellhead. At approximately 8 : 50 p. m. <b>the</b> Macondo <b>well</b> became underbalanced and <b>the</b> <b>well</b> soon experienced a kick. The kick on April 20 th developed into a blowout and at 9 : 49 p. m. the first explosion hit the Deepwater Horizon rig. The accident caused 11 fatalities, the destruction of the Deepwater Horizon Rig and a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The CAST analysis performed uncovered how important the correct enforcement of safety constraints can be, as the result of violating the safety constraints at Macondo resulted in a horrific accident. Creating the models from the CAST analysis showed just how inadequate the system operations were at controlling the safety of <b>the</b> Macondo <b>well.</b> <b>The</b> models revealed that MMS did not have a regulatory structure capable of enforcing safety for deepwater drilling operations, and that BP quite carelessly changed procedures after receiving permits from MMS. Not regarding the fatalities the worst part of the accident was that the industry itself was shocked after it happened. How could they be, considering how they operated? The systemic accident approach is superior to the event based models. From the analysis it is evident that the accident was caused by a number of violations throughout the hierarchal safety control structure. Event based models may have concluded and blamed the lowest level for the accident and therefore ignored the problems throughout the hierarchical safety control structure. This proves the suitability for the systemic accident approach, especially as an important tool to improve future safety processes. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{groundwater}} {{risk assessment}} {{was carried out}} for 30 potable water supply systems under a framework of protecting drinking water quality across South Australia. A semi-quantitative Groundwater Risk Assessment Model (GRAM) was developed based on a “multi-barrier” approach using likelihood of release, contaminant pathway and consequence equation. Groundwater vulnerability and well integrity have been incorporated to the pathway component of the risk equation. The land use of the study basins varies from protected water reserves to heavily stocked grazing lands. Based on the risk assessment, 15 systems were considered as low risk, four as medium and 11 systems as at high risk.

40|$|On a {{geological}} {{carbon dioxide}} storage site, wells (decommissioned or active) drilled through low-permeable caprock are potential connections between the CO 2 storage reservoir and overlying sensitive targets like aquifers. The integrity of wells over time is therefore essential for the fluids confinements (brine with or without dissolved CO 2 or buoyant gaseous CO 2). Well integrity {{can be defined as}} its capacity to maintain the isolation of fluids in the subsurface reservoirs. To ensure this isolation, the well casing and the caprock are bonded by a cement sheath; after abandonment, a cement plug is used to avoid upward migration within the casing. However, according to the literature wellbore integrity might be compromised by a) operational defects (during the drilling and cementing processes, during the operations where pressure and temperature changes can modify stress conditions, during the abandonment process) or b) chemical changes especially in the context of CO 2 storage where different chemical environments can be possibly found. The evolution of <b>the</b> <b>well</b> <b>integrity</b> is therefore a complex combination of several physical processes (hydrological, thermal, mechanical and chemical at least) on the different materials and elements (formation, cement, casing, interfaces, annuli). The issue addressed in this study is the behaviour of the complete wellbore system in different conditions and especially under influence of CO 2. An in situ experiment has been designed and is being run in an underground rock laboratory (Mont Terri, Switzerland) at an intermediate scale between the laboratory experiments (which offer the opportunity to assess specific phenomena over time) and field observations (which allow an assessment of the entire system in subsurface at a specific time). The purpose is here to follow the evolution of the integrity of the whole well system both for hydrogeological and geochemical aspects. Modelling and lab experiments, including material characterization are performed in parallel to enable a better interpretation and understanding of the observations. The experimental setup has been designed as follows: a small section of a wellbore is reproduced in the Opalinus Clay of the underground rock laboratory (caprock-like formation) at scale 1 : 1 (5. 5 '' casing and Ø 198 mm borehole), using carbon steel for the casing and class G cement. Below and above the well section, two different intervals have been designed for a continuous monitoring of the pressure and temperature conditions or for fluid injection and extraction (for fluid sampling for instance). The experimental protocol contains several stages: 1 - Drilling, relaxation and well completion; 2 - Initial state characterization; 3 - Temperature increase in the system and characterisation; 4 - Injection of pore water with dissolved CO 2 and tracers, and characterization. The characterization of the system includes both performing hydro-tests (continuous and constant-head tests) to quantify the hydraulic properties of the well and their evolution over time, and sampling the fluids to analyse the geochemical composition and changes. Stages 1, 2 and 3 are now completed and stage 4 is in progress. The first results (of stage 2 and 3) confirm the ability of the chosen design to assess well integrity over time. It also shows first trends in the evolution of integrity especially under influence of the temperature: the equivalent permeability of the wellbore decreased significantly during that stage, improving <b>the</b> <b>well</b> <b>integrity.</b> Three modelling methods are used to predict the results of the experiment or to use the recorded data: 1) flow and transport modelling, 2) geochemical modelling, and 3) reactive transport modelling (TOUGH 2 used for 1, and PhreeqC and TOUGHREACT for 2 and 3). Flow modelling has been associated with the hydraulic tests in order to quantify <b>the</b> <b>well</b> <b>integrity</b> in terms of equivalent permeability during stage 2 and 3. Temperature effects have been included in the models to understand the changes that occurred in terms of effective permeability during stage 3. Geochemical models have been developed to evaluate the validity of chemical sealing as a potential explanation for the increase of well integrity observed during stage 3. The models are also used as predictive tools on the potential evolutionary scenarios for stage 4, regarding water chemistry variations and mineralogical changes. They have been notably useful to calibrate the conditions of the dissolved CO 2 in terms of tracers used, and of sampling and in-line fluid analysis protocol. Each of those models will be progressively refined during the CO 2 -dissolved injection (stage 4) with the aim of aiding the interpretation of the observed processes and phenomena. Finally this field experiment-modelling integrated framework is completed by laboratory characterizations and experiments (in autoclave principally) carried out to provide input data for the modelling with regards to cement, caprock and their reactivity with pore water and CO 2...|$|E
30|$|Here, we {{presented}} {{the advantage of}} correlational structure and function studies of membrane proteins in nano-size uni-lamellar lipodisq with SMA surrounding the lipid bilayer, even native cell membrane. Other alternative nano-size uni-lamellar membrane configurations, such as bicelles and nanodiscs, were reported to improve substrate accessibilities to two sides of an incorporated membrane protein in lipid bilayers (Raschle et al., 2010). However, specific lipid, detergents are required for bicelles formation, but resulting in a heterogeneous system (in size and composition) (Raschle et al., 2010). Apo-lipoprotein nanodiscs, composing of a lipid core surrounded by an amphipathic membrane scaffold protein (MSP) (Bayburt and Sligar, 2003, 2010), had the advantage {{that they could be}} made from a variety of lipid mixtures, and was relatively mono-dispersed in size upon protein incorporation. Nevertheless, nanodiscs still required detergents for protein incorporation, and could not be directly applied for native membrane system. Moreover, presence of the MSP might bring unpredictable interferences to incorporated proteins or specific interactions to lipids in core. Besides <b>the</b> <b>well</b> <b>integrity</b> maintenance of the native environment and the integral membrane proteins in uni-lamellar lipodisq, the improved accessibility of soluble partner to SMA based lipodisqs in homogenous size provided much convenience for further receptor ligand binding, enzymology analysis and protein-protein interaction analysis in native cell membrane environment using 19 F solid state NMR or other biophysical methods. Therefore, size homogenous SMA based lipodisqs can not only improve accessibility of soluble partner, but also maintain integrity of the native environment for the integral membrane proteins.|$|E

This is not without reason. Resent studies shows that a simple mistake like dropping a hammer, may not only be caused by the obvious direct cause like inattention but may be caused by several underlying causes such as deficiencies {{in the design of the}} drill floor, operating instructions, follow-up of safety notices, competence, planning and implementation, deficient management, and breach of procedure. Historical events like the Piper Alpha incident shows that this underlying causes or human and organizational factors are vital to develop and improve the systems. This means that by improving human and organizational factors may contribute to <b>the</b> improvement of <b>well</b> <b>integrity.</b> This thesis will explain the concept of human and organizational factors through a detailed literary survey. Different models and methods has been presented (the human performance model, Decision making, the "step ladder" decision model, performance influencing factors, human error causation paradigm, human-,technology- and organizational concept) to give the reader a decent understanding of the concept. It is important for this thesis that the reader is given a detailed insight in this aspect since most of the main objectives in this project is answered using these models and methods. Human error has been identified as a primary causal factor in 70 - 80 % of accidents in the oil and gas industry. Identifying and classifying the human and organizational factors of an accident is an effective tool to assist in the investigation process, the target training and make it easier to implement prevention efforts. Through discussions and careful analysis of five methods deemed fit for classification of human and organizational factors in the oil and gas industry, was the STEPP method identified as the best classification scheme for human and organizational factors relevant to <b>well</b> <b>integrity</b> in various phases of a well s life. <b>Well</b> <b>integrity</b> is vulnerable to unforeseen factors that have a critical influence on the work performance. Understanding these unforeseen factors and the relationship between themthrough a human, technological and operational perspective can give better working environment and an opportunity to improve the health, safety integrity, and work performance. Challenges reviled through the human, technological and organizational perspective was identified and categorised as: well control training and knowledge, <b>well</b> <b>integrity</b> training and courses, human computer interface, qualification and testing ofwell barrier elements, verification ofwell barrier elements, automation, national and international standard, <b>well</b> <b>integrity</b> management system, handover documentation and well barrier schematics.

Well cement plays a vital role in <b>well</b> <b>integrity</b> for any sequestration projects, and ordinary Portland cement (OPC) based well cement has been used in underground wells. There are many problems, such as cement degradation, chemical attacks, durability issues, leakage, etc., associated with OPC based well cement. One of the best replacements for OPC based well cement would be the use of geopolymer cement, as it is economical in production, sustainable in reducing waste products, consumes less energy, doesn‟t undergo chemical attacks, durable, resistive in acidic environments and possess higher strength compared to OPC. This paper will review suitability of geopolymer as well cement under downhole conditions, and analyse the advantages of using geopolymer over OPC-based well cement. Moreover, well cement will be exposed to range of temperatures, pressures and fluid medium from the ground surface to sequestration depths of more than 1 km. Therefore, this paper aims to study the mechanical behaviour of geopolymer under different curing temperatures (from 23 ºC to 80 ºC) and curing mediums (brine, water and CO 2 saturated brine). It has been found that optimum curing temperature for higher strength is 60 ºC and geopolymer exhibits high strength compared to class G cement above ambient temperature.

40|$|The {{useful life}} of an {{offshore}} well {{is determined by the}} reserves which it contacts, the pressure support within the reservoir and the continued integrity of the wellbore. When a well has reached the end of its lifetime, plugging operations have to be conducted before permanent abandonment. Conventional Plug and Abandonment (P&A) operations will often require removing a section of the casing in order to create cross sectional barriers for well abandonment. Recently developed and field tested technology has the potential of efficiently setting cross sectional reservoir barriers without casing removal. Access to the annuli can be achieved through perforation and then the perforated interval can be washed prior to setting a P&A barrier. By deploying a wireline rig-up it can be possible to set a reservoir barrier prior to removal of the previously installed production or injection tubing. Wireline work can also provide information about <b>the</b> <b>well</b> <b>integrity</b> which can determine the potential for setting further reservoir barriers with minimum removal of tubulars. Further development of technology necessary to safely abandon wells with minimum removal of tubulars can provide cost efficient and robust plugging methods for abandoning offshore oil or gas fields without the need of deploying a drilling rig. This thesis will introduce methods of setting P&A barriers with minimal removal of tubulars as the main focus. Descriptions of various plugging operations will be given. Considerations regarding the critical factors encountered during plugging operations will be discussed, more specifically the current condition of wellbore integrity and the barrier envelope necessary to prevent uncontrolled release of hydrocarbons during or after plugging operations...|$|E
40|$|The A-Area Miscellaneous Rubble Pile (ARP) is a 5. 9 acre unit {{located at}} the {{southern}} end of A/M Area at the Savannah River Site (SRS). Disposal activities at ARP began in the early 1950 s. The exact dates of operation and material disposed in the unit remain unknown. Within the ARP exists a smaller, approximately 2 acre, sub unit identified as the Trenches Area. The Trenches Area is dominated by a T-shaped trench (approximately 50 feet wide) containing 8 to 12 feet of ash material. This T-shaped trench will be referred to as the ARP Trench. Vegetation has been removed from the Trenches Area and a lower permeability earthen cover now covers the ARP Trench. The ARP active soil vapor extraction (ASVE) remediation system consists of seven extraction wells and twelve monitoring wells that were pushed into the vadose zone of the ARP Trench. The remediation system was designed based on the pre-design study conducted in 2002. The purpose of the initial soil vapor extraction (SVE) well testing was to verify the integrity and functionality of the nineteen wells installed in the ARP Trench. <b>The</b> <b>well</b> <b>integrity</b> was evaluated based on the flow rate, vacuum, and indication that soil gas and not surface air was pulled from the well. Soil gas was defined as gas with levels of carbon dioxide (CO 2) above ambient concentrations (400 - 700 ppmv). Volatile organic compound (VOC) concentrations were measured at each well to determine the initial distribution of the contamination. In addition, the subsurface vacuum distribution was measured around each extraction well as a relative measure of the influence of each well...|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{capture and}} storage (CCS) {{technique}} is found as a best solution {{to reduce the}} emission of CO 2 to the atmosphere. In this technique, the CO 2 emitted from large industries is captured, and pressurized, and finally injected into deep underground reservoirs. In a geological sequestration project, integrity of injection well play an important role. It means the well cement is a key factor that affects <b>the</b> <b>well</b> <b>integrity.</b> In typical injection wells, Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) based cement is used as well cement {{and it has been}} found that it undergoes degradation in CO 2 rich environment. Geopolymer can be a good alternative to existing OPC based well cement as it has been found that geopolymer possess high strength and durability compared to OPC. Geopolymer is a binder produced through the process called geopolymerization of alumino- silicate materials and alkaline activators. In the sequestration wells, well cement is exposed to different curing temperatures with a geothermal gradient of 30 °C/km. Therefore, it is important to study the mechanical behaviour of well cement with curing temperatures expected deep under the ground. Therefore, this research aims to study geopolymer as well cement and its mechanical behaviour at different curing temperatures (25, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 °C). In addition, effect of ageing on the mechanical behaviour was also studied. The OPC samples were tested for the comparison of results with geopolymer. The results showed that the optimal curing temperature for higher strength of geopolymer and OPC are 60 °C and 50 °C respectively. Geopolymer possess highest strength at elevated temperatures whereas OPC possess higher strength at ambient temperatures. Moreover, at elevated temperature curing, geopolymer develops ultimate strength within short curing period and it does not gain significant strength with further ageing...|$|E

40|$|As {{part of the}} {{government}} response to the Deepwater Horizon blowout, a <b>Well</b> <b>Integrity</b> Team evaluated <b>the</b> geologic hazards of shutting in <b>the</b> Macondo <b>Well</b> at <b>the</b> seafloor and determined the conditions under which it could safely be undertaken. Of particular concern was the possibility that, under the anticipated high shut-in pressures, oil could leak out of <b>the</b> <b>well</b> casing below <b>the</b> seafloor. Such a leak could lead to new geologic pathways for hydrocarbon release to the Gulf of Mexico.

40|$|International audienceAbandonned {{wells in}} the {{depleted}} reservoirs envisaged to host CO 2 geological storages {{are the main}} possible leakage pathways of CO 2 towards shallow aquifers. Then, for impact assesment, the alteration of well materials with CO 2 in the reservoir conditions requires to be characterized. Here, the interaction of a composite well sample - formed of steel casing, surrounded by Portland cement, itself surrounded by sandstone - with wet CO 2 and CO 2 -saturated brine under pressure and temperature controlled conditions was studied combining a set of batch experiments and reactive transport modeling. In the experiments, lasting up to 8 weeks, noticeable mineralogical changes were observed in the cement, at the interface with the sandstone, leading to a carbonation of the cement. Main mineralogical changes consisted in dissolution of portlandite, replacement of CSH phases rich in Si by Ca-rich CSH phases and precipitation of calcite, amorphous silica and zeolite. Interestingly, no re-dissolution of calcite was observed at the outer boundary of the cement, in relation with the penetration of the carbonation front, as observed in experiments involving only cement and CO 2 -saturated brine. For the two other components of the composite well samples, few changes were observed. The steel shown a moderate corrosion with some precipitations of Fe-oxides at its surface. No changes were observed in the sandstone. These changes in mineralogy were reproduced with the reactive transport model, which highlights the successive dissolution/precipitation reactions. A good agreement was also obtained with the brine composition evolution record during the experiment. It {{is worth noting that}} the model suggested slight mineralogical changes in the sandstone consisting in dissolution of carbonates at the boundary of the sample, in direct contact with the CO 2 -saturated brine. This observation, in link with the experimental observations in the cement, indicate a buffering effect of the rock on the CO 2 perturbation. This possible buffering was observed by observations at a larger scale on industrial analogue well samples and suggests a preservation of <b>the</b> <b>well</b> <b>integrity...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe K 12 -B gas {{field is}} located in the Dutch sector of the North Sea. The top of the {{reservoir}} lies approximately 3800  meters below sea level, and the ambient temperature of the reservoir is over 127  °C. The K 12 -B gas field has been producing natural gas from 1987 onwards and is currently operated by GDF SUEZ E&P Nederland B. V. The natural gas has an initial CO 2 content of 13 %, which is relatively high. Since the start of the gas production the CO 2 component has been separated from the natural gas stream on-site and since 2004 part of the separated CO 2 is re-injected into the gas field. In 2004 a demonstration project commenced where CO 2 was re-injected into K 12 -B. The goal was to investigate the feasibility of CO 2 injection and storage in depleted natural gas fields. More than 6 years later CO 2 injection is still taking place and numerous monitoring techniques have been applied {{in order to get a}} better understanding of various aspects of underground CO 2 storage in nearly depleted gas fields. Over the years monitoring activities have mainly focused on <b>the</b> <b>well</b> <b>integrity</b> and on the behavior of the CO 2 in the well and reservoir. The cap rock present at K 12 -B consists of hundreds of meters of rock salts from the Zechstein Super Group. The most likely migration pathway for any gas, should migration occur at all is therefore along the well bores. Establishing the conditions of wells is of great importance for safety issues. Some of the tools which have been used will be discussed. Another goal for the various monitoring activities is to gain a better understanding of the behavior of the CO 2 in the injection wells and the migration of the CO 2 in the reservoir. How the CO 2 migrates in the reservoir is important as regards the assessment of the potential for enhanced gas recovery (EGR) by CO 2 injection...|$|E
40|$|The {{temporary}} plug and abandonment (P&A) of old wells, {{and the following}} slot recovery, will be important for increasing the average rate of recovery from the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS). However, these operations faces challenges like high costs, safety concerns, environmental issues, and rapidly growing demand. Maintaining well integrity may be difficult when re-entering old wells. The demand for increased efficiency may lead operators to compromise on safety to finalize projects in time. This thesis tries to give a broad understanding of <b>the</b> <b>well</b> <b>integrity</b> issues on the NCS, and then tie these ndings around the term slot recovery operations. It {{will be important to}} understand the aspects which aects the lifetime of a well. Especially the long-term pressure, temperature and chemical effects on casings/tubings are important aspects to be understood. If this is done, one can increase the material lifetime in a well, and thus be able to re-use more of the casing strings in a slot recovery. These measures will help to keep marginal fields protable for a longer period. The thesis has also kept a strong focus on the challenges regarding the planning phase of a slot recovery operation. Of the essential factors in a slot recovery is to verify the old barrier envelope, and based on these findings create a robust operational plan. One of the mistakes which has been done in several slot recoveries is that the plan is created before any tests have been done. Once the plan is set and signed by the management, changes are harder to implement. Testing of the well often reveals unexpected factors which needs to be taken into consideration when planning an operation. Two separate slot recovery operations were also studied. They were carefully chosen to highlight typical issues with a slot recovery, and thus show that the theory fits with the reality. The requirements and guidelines for wells on the NCS also needs to be more customized for slot recovery operations. </p...|$|E
