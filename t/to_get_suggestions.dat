Methods: In this thesis the method of descriptive analysis was used. The information on varsity sport in Canada was mainly collected by exploring the documents of the governing body for varsity sports, the Canadian University Sport. The second method used was an interview. This was used in order to get additional information on varsity sports and <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>suggestions</b> and ideas from student-athletes. Results: Several problematic areas in varsity sports in Canada were identified: athletic financial awards, funding of the teams, several eligibility rules (number of years of eligibility, academic requirements, athletes' age limit), non-Canadian student-athletes, limited number of varsity sports, and limited opportunities for the athletes to continue their sport after graduation. Suggestions were made in order to improve these areas. Keywords: varsity sport, student-athlete, eligibility rules, Sport Canada, Canadian Sport System, Canadian University Spor...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to clarify the system design about the school {{governing}} bodies in England, which is one of models of the school management councils (Gakkou Unei Kyougikai) in Japan, and <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>suggestions</b> for Japan. Firstly, in terms of distribution of powers between the headteacher and the governing body, the governing body is dependent on largely headteacher for its decision making. Secondly, in terms of involvement of external authorities, the system is designed as external authorities can play decisive role in the decision making concerning curriculum, personnel, and budget. Then, this paper points out that school management in England is practically getting professionalized including governing bodies though lay governors are formally elected, and that more recent years local councils have been changed to an executive model, sometimes with a directly elected mayor. Taking these circumstances into account, this paper concludes that the existence of school based management is questionable, and that the school governing body system could make it difficult to restrict the power of the central government and to reflect local public opinion on education to the local authority...|$|E

A brief description of the national sources available for Greek teachers in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>suggestions</b> concerning successful experiences in chemistry teaching is presented. The key competences which students need to develop in order to face successfully the study of chemistry are subsequently presented. These competences are examined in the general framework of the required learning skills for students in the 21 st century. Five selected examples of successful experiences in chemistry teaching taken from the Greek educational reality are presented. The reported examples cover all three educational levels (primary, secondary and tertiary education) and their successful learning outcomes have been validated via conduct of educational research. Detailed content analysis of the material of the national workshop on successful experiences has provided evidence for the Greek chemistry teachers and scientific experts opinions on “what constitutes a successful experience in chemistry teaching ” and the conditions required for the successful implementation of a novel teaching approach. In addition, several proposals of good teaching practices made by Greek chemistry educators are presented. Finally, the results on the testing by several Greek teachers of 11 teaching resources available in the Chemistry is All Around Network project database are critically discussed.

Friends for years, they met at The Groundlings, a Los Angeles-based improvisational comedy troupe where they wrote sketches with one another, in the early 2000s. The basic premise for the film originated in 2006, shortly after Wiig was cast in the supporting role of a passive-aggressive cable television executive in producer Judd Apatow's comedy film Knocked Up (2007). Recognizing her comedic talent, Apatow asked Wiig {{if she had any}} ideas for a screenplay herself - a practice which had previously led to Steve Carell's idea for The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005) - and she and Mumolo soon came up with Bridesmaids. Over the following years, writing commenced, with Wiig working on Saturday Night Live in New York City and Mumolo grinding out the script in Los Angeles.

Just for your information, I am enclosing a copy of the letter that was sent out in June in-viting various people in northwestern Ohio to serve on an area advisory committee. A copy of the news story lists the names of the people who accepted. We now are trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>suggestions</b> for additional members, and I would appreciate any names you could offer. Although we have included 22 northwestern Ohio counties in our list, we are most interested in the ones fairly close to Lucas [...] such as Fulton, Henry, Defiance, Wood, Ottawa, Sandusky, Hancock and Seneca. As I said, most members of the medical school Foundation favor the cigarette tax extension because we think it might make it easier for us to get state money for the medical school. As far as the area advisory group is concerned, we will merely state our position, but will not ask them to campaign or even vote for the tax if they have any reason to oppose it. The main purpose of the area advisory group will be to have an organization that might help distribute the brochure we are working on describ-ing the medical school project, and to inform people in their communities of the advantages a medical center here would offer citizens of this region. Again, many thanks for your encouragement. / / John D. Willey JDW:ea eric. THE TOLEDO AREA MEDICAL COLLEGE AND EDUCATION FOUNDATION 2801 W.

WILLEY As you probably know, the Toledo Area Medical College and Education Foundation, after considerable study, has proposed the construction of a medical school on the campus of the University of Toledo. The Board of Directors of the University has set aside fifty acres of land for a medical center. The project has been given substantial support and assistance from the Academy of Medicine of Toledo and Lucas County and the Academy of Pharmacyÿ Lucas County Commissioners, the City Council of Toledo, the Board of Health and many others. The need for additional medical school facilities in Ohio has been substantiated by many authoritiesÿ and Toledo was recommended as the first choice for a site in Ohio by a panel of medical educators engaged by the Interim Commission on Education Beyond the High School. A bill was introduced in the Legislature calling for establishment of a medical school in Toledo, and hearings were held by the House Education Committee. Much work has been done on the project alreadyÿ and now help is needed for the work that must be done in the future. At present, the Foundation, a non-profit corporation, consists of fourteen members from Toledo and Lucas County, We now are organizing an area advisory group with members from communities in some twenty-two counties of northwestern Ohio. It is hoped that these members will join those of the Foundation in informing themselves of the need for a new medical center for northwestern Ohio and the advantages it would offer residents of the area, and, in turn, pass this information along to other citizens in each county. Once the group is organized, we plan to have a meeting of all members to bring them up to date on the status of the project.

40|$|The {{last couple}} of years have seen a {{fascinating}} evolution. While the early Web predominantly focused on human consumption of Web content, the widespread dissemination of social software and Web 2. 0 technologies enabled new forms of collaborative content creation and problem solving. These new forms often utilize the principles of collective intelligence, a phenomenon that emerges from {{a group of people who}} either cooperate or compete with each other to create a result that is better or more intelligent than any individual result (Leimeister, 2010; Malone, Laubacher, & Dellarocas, 2010). Crowdsourcing has recently gained attention as one of the mechanisms that taps into the power of web-enabled collective intelligence (Howe, 2008). Brabham (2013) defines it as “an online, distributed problem-solving and production model that leverages the collective intelligence of online communities to serve specific organizational goals” (p. xix). Well-known examples of crowdsourcing platforms are Wikipedia, Amazon Mechanical Turk, or InnoCentive. Since the emergence of the term crowdsourcing in 2006, one popular misconception is that crowdsourcing relies largely on an amateur crowd rather than a pool of professional skilled workers (Brabham, 2013). As this might be true for low cognitive tasks, such as tagging a picture or rating a product, it is often not true for complex problem-solving and creative tasks, such as developing a new computer algorithm or creating an impressive product design. This raises the question of how to efficiently allocate an enterprise crowdsourcing task to appropriate members of the crowd. The sheer number of crowdsourcing tasks available at crowdsourcing intermediaries makes it especially challenging for workers to identify a task that matches their skills, experiences, and knowledge (Schall, 2012, p. 2). An explanation why the identification of appropriate expert knowledge plays a major role in crowdsourcing is partly given in Condorcet’s jury theorem (Sunstein, 2008, p. 25). The theorem states that if the average participant in a binary decision process is more likely to be correct than incorrect, then as the number of participants increases, the higher the probability is that the aggregate arrives at the right answer. When assuming that a suitable participant for a task is more likely to give a correct answer or solution than an improper one, efficient task recommendation becomes crucial to improve the aggregated results in crowdsourcing processes. Although some assumptions of the theorem, such as independent votes, binary decisions, and homogenous groups, are often unrealistic in practice, it illustrates the importance of an optimized task allocation and group formation that consider the task requirements and workers’ characteristics. Ontologies are widely applied to support semantic search and recommendation mechanisms (Middleton, De Roure, & Shadbolt, 2009). However, little research has investigated the potentials and the design of an ontology for the domain of enterprise crowdsourcing. The author of this thesis argues in favor of enhancing the automation and interoperability of an enterprise crowdsourcing environment with the introduction of a semantic vocabulary in form of an expressive but easy-to-use ontology. The deployment of a semantic vocabulary for enterprise crowdsourcing is likely to provide several technical and economic benefits for an enterprise. These benefits were the main drivers in efforts made during the research project of this thesis: 1. Task allocation: With the utilization of the semantics, requesters are able to form smaller task-specific crowds that perform tasks at lower costs and in less time than larger crowds. A standardized and controlled vocabulary allows requesters to communicate specific details about a crowdsourcing activity within a web page along with other existing displayed information. This has advantages for both contributors and requesters. On the one hand, contributors can easily and precisely search for tasks that correspond to their interests, experiences, skills, knowledge, and availability. On the other hand, crowdsourcing systems and intermediaries can proactively recommend crowdsourcing tasks to potential contributors (e. g., based on their social network profiles). 2. Quality control: Capturing and storing crowdsourcing data increases the overall transparency of the entire crowdsourcing activity and thus allows for a more sophisticated quality control. Requesters are able to check the consistency and receive appropriate support to verify and validate crowdsourcing data according to defined data types and value ranges. Before involving potential workers in a crowdsourcing task, requesters can also judge their trustworthiness based on previous accomplished tasks and hence improve the recruitment process. 3. Task definition: A standardized set of semantic entities supports the configuration of a crowdsourcing task. Requesters can evaluate historical crowdsourcing data <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>suggestions</b> for equal or similar crowdsourcing tasks, for example, which incentive or evaluation mechanism to use. They may also decrease their time to configure a crowdsourcing task by reusing well-established task specifications of a particular type. 4. Data integration and exchange: Applying a semantic vocabulary as a standard format for describing enterprise crowdsourcing activities allows not only crowdsourcing systems inside but also crowdsourcing intermediaries outside the company to extract crowdsourcing data from other business applications, such as project management, enterprise resource planning, or social software, and use it for further processing without retyping and copying the data. Additionally, enterprise or web search engines may exploit the structured data and provide enhanced search, browsing, and navigation capabilities, for example, clustering similar crowdsourcing tasks according to the required qualifications or the offered incentives...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Pre-service English {{teachers}} are prospective teachers {{that need to}} master not only four English skills but also another supporting skill, critical thinking. Critical thinking {{can be considered as}} an essential substance contributing to the success of pre-service English teachers learning English. Some skills in English such as listening, speaking, reading and writing can be successfully achieved whenever they are critical, since critical thinking is also the ability allowing the students to express everything freely. Unfortunately, utilizing critical thinking is not as simple as seen. Therefore, project-based learning was utilized to accommodate the use of the pre-service English teachers’ critical thinking and how their critical thinking is raised. By conducting descriptive qualitative design, this research aims to elaborate the utilizing project based learning to raise pre-service English teachers’ critical thinking. The research was conducted in TEYL Media class for the sixth semester consisting of 35 pre-service English teachers. They were divided into some groups, each consisting of 3 - 4 people assigned to make a project within 6 - 12 weeks, in the forms of producing teaching media for TEYL.

40|$|This {{article is}} based on a {{descriptive}} study using survey method and focus group interviews. Thinking skills and problem solving skills are vital for pupils in their daily lives and facing their future challenges. Therefore, parents and teachers {{play an important role in}} nurturing these skills among pupils. The objective of the study is to explore parents’ and teachers’ views of pupils’ thinking skills and problem solving skills according to locations of the school (urban and rural). This study also explores parents’ and teachers’ suggestions to enhance pupils’ thinking skills and problem solving skills. The sample consists of 302 parents of the pupils and 104 teachers who are teaching Year 4, Year 5 and Year 6. The quantitative data for the research was collected using questionnaires which were developed by the researchers. Each set of questionnaire consists of 23 items. While the qualitative data was collected through the focus group interview method among parents and teachers <b>to</b> <b>get</b> their <b>suggestions</b> on how to enhance pupils’ thinking skills and problem solving skills. The findings show that the urban parents’ views of children’s thinking skills and problem solving skills is significantly higher than those from the rural. The results also indicate that there is no significant difference between the urban school teachers’ and the rural school teachers’ views of pupils’ thinking skills and problem solving skills. Findings from the focus group interviews show that most parents engage their children in hands on activities at home to enhance their thinking skills and problem solving skills. On the other hand, teachers encourage active participation of pupils in co-curricular activities to enhance pupils’ thinking skills and problem solving skills...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} a result of a master thesis for the Master Programme in Industrial Design Engineering {{focusing}} on Production Design. The work is done for Scania Ferruform AB and it has the goal of trying to improve the control and planning of the production of rear axles. The problem situation that was the basis of the project was that the control and planning of the production did not work as desired. The purpose and the aim of the project was <b>to</b> <b>get</b> concrete <b>suggestions</b> on how to improve the planning and the control of the production and to create a body of knowledge for different planning methods. The methods used in the project are, amongst others, interviews and observations to understand the present situation. To test the improvements a simulation in Extendsim was done. An analysis of the present situation showed that it wasn't the planning method that was wrong. When the goal is to produce just-in-time it is right to start from the customer needs and it is also right to use a flow that pulls where the customer needs are not given. There is still room for improvement though, the ordersizes could be reduced and standardized for welding and machining. There were also some control changes to try, such as take away mixing rules and adjust in real time. One of the results that emerged from the project was that the buffer between the welding and machining was unnecessary. The different simulation experiments also showed that adjustments should be made in real time as well as the proportion of outlays should be reduced, thus improving quality. It was also noted that most of the lead-time was spent at the press and intake. Based on these results, the conclusions was made that adjustment should take place in real time, the buffer between the welding and machining should be removed, the proportion of outlays should be reduced and an attempt to reduce the lead time for press and intake by reducing the buffers should be done.
