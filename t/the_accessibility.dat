The game's first demo build was released on February 7, 2011, and development continued until December 1, 2015, when the PMDT announced it would cease further development of Project M. The game has received positive comments from reviewers, amassed a player base of over 500,000, surpassed three million downloads, and been played in many professional tournaments.|$|E

A sequel, Hatoful Boyfriend: Holiday Star, was released on 29 December 2011, with an English version being released on Christmas Day the following year. In addition to the main games in the series, Hatoful Boyfriend has made transitions into other media: a monthly webcomic was serialized in the anthology Manga Life WIN+, several supplementary materials and official dōjin works have been released, and four drama CDs based on the series have been made. An episodic web series began in 2014.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, other {{proteins}} {{have evolved}} to bind to particular DNA sequences. The most intensively studied of these are the various transcription factors, which are proteins that regulate transcription. Each transcription factor binds to one particular set of DNA sequences and activates or inhibits the transcription of genes that have these sequences close to their promoters. The transcription factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can bind the RNA polymerase responsible for transcription, either directly or through other mediator proteins; this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it to begin transcription. Alternatively, transcription factors can bind enzymes that modify the histones at the promoter. This changes <b>the</b> <b>accessibility</b> of the DNA template to the polymerase.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} well {{received}} by reviewers, who appreciated the improvements in <b>the</b> <b>accessibility</b> of the game, allowing players to immediately {{jump in and}} play without spending excessive time in the game's menus. The game also sold well, however, it sold about less than 50 percent of Guitar Hero: World Tour's sales, specifically selling 1.2 million copies across all platforms. Improvements to both the Career and competitive multiplayer modes were also highlights of the game.

5|$|People {{living in}} areas with high rates of HIV/AIDS face several {{psychological}} barriers when deciding whether to undergo testing for HIV. For example, people may prefer not {{to know if they}} are HIV-positive because, due to the obstacles they often face in gaining access to antiretroviral drugs, many view HIV/AIDS diagnoses as death sentences. Others may simply believe that they are HIV-negative, either because they practice strict monogamy and consistently use condoms during sexual intercourse or because they are in denial about the prevalence of the disease. However, despite these barriers, both mobile and static testing services have become more widely available in Malawi recently: 1,392 testing and counseling sites existed in 2011. Certain non-governmental organization such as the Malawi AIDS Counseling and Resource Organisation (MACRO) provide door-to-door counseling and testing services, which have drastically improved <b>the</b> <b>accessibility</b> of HIV testing.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of the key}} {{principles}} {{associated with}} the thin conception {{of the rule of}} law include judicial independence, natural justice, the availability of judicial review, and <b>the</b> <b>accessibility</b> of justice. Judicial independence in Singapore is safeguarded by various constitutional provisions and legal rules, though some commentators have highlighted certain events as suggesting a lack of judicial independence. One incident in the 1980s involving the transfer of the Senior District Judge to the Attorney-General's Chambers following a decision he made which was favourable to an opposition politician was investigated by a commission of inquiry and found not to be due to executive interference. In Singapore, natural justice is generally regarded as a procedural rather than a substantive concept. The process of judicial review involves the review of executive actions for compliance with administrative law rules, and of executive and legislative acts for unconstitutionality in light of the doctrine of constitutional supremacy. The state of the courts and legal processes in Singapore are largely seen as making justice accessible for the citizenry.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to real-time accessibility analysis for manipulative robotic tasks using graphics hardware. The workspace is captured using a stereo camera, and heterogeneously modeled with the recognized plane features, recognized objects with complete solid models, and unrecognized 3 D point clouds organized with a multiresolution octree. When the service robot is requested to manipulate a recognized object, <b>the</b> local <b>accessibility</b> information for <b>the</b> object is retrieved from the object database. Then, accessibility analysis is done to verify <b>the</b> local <b>accessibility</b> and determine <b>the</b> global <b>accessibility.</b> <b>The</b> verification process utilizes the visibility query, which is accelerated by graphics hardware. The experimental results show the feasibility of realtime and behavior-oriented 3 D modeling of workspace for robotic manipulative tasks, and also the performance gain of <b>the</b> hardware-accelerated <b>accessibility</b> analysis obtained using the commodity graphics card. ...|$|R

5|$|Two {{important}} legal {{decisions in}} the 1930s helped increase <b>the</b> <b>accessibility</b> of contraceptives. In 1930, two condom manufacturers sued {{each other in the}} Youngs Rubber case, and the judge ruled that contraceptive manufacturing was a legitimate business enterprise. He went further, and declared that the federal law prohibiting the mailing of condoms was not legally sound. Sanger precipitated a second legal breakthrough when she ordered a diaphragm from Japan in 1932, hoping to provoke a decisive battle in the courts. The diaphragm was confiscated by the U.S. government, and Sanger's subsequent legal challenge led to the 1936 One Package legal ruling by Judge Augustus Hand. His decision overturned an important provision of the anti-contraception laws that prohibited physicians from obtaining contraceptives.Rose, Melody, Abortion: A Documentary and Reference Guide, ABC-CLIO, 2008, p. 29.Tone, p. 178: Tone calls the ruling a coup d'etat for Sanger. This court victory motivated the American Medical Association in 1937 to finally adopt contraception as a normal medical service and a core component of medical school curricula.. Retrieved 15 October 2011. However, the medical community was slow to accept this new responsibility, and women continued to rely on unsafe and ineffective contraceptive advice from ill-informed sources until the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|This {{order is}} {{referred}} to as <b>the</b> <b>accessibility</b> hierarchy. If a language can relativize positions lower in <b>the</b> <b>accessibility</b> hierarchy, it can always relativize positions higher up, but not vice versa. For example, Malagasy can relativize only subject and Chukchi only absolutive arguments, whilst Basque can relativize absolutives, ergatives and indirect objects, but not obliques or genitives or objects of comparatives. Similar hierarchies have been proposed in other circumstances, e.g. for pronominal reflexes.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{and explains}} {{the growth of}} the Minneapolis Skyway network. Accessibility is used as a major factor in understanding that growth (i. e. does the network connect to the location(s) with <b>the</b> highest <b>accessibility,</b> followed by <b>the</b> second highest, and so on). First, employment opportunities are used as the measure of activity and are based off of the square footage of buildings and/or ITE trip generation rates.

The purpose is to determine how often the expansion connected the block with <b>the</b> highest <b>accessibility.</b> <b>The</b> results show that though important, accessibility was rarely maximized, except {{in the early stages of}} development. A connect-choice logit model relating the probability of joining the network (in a given year) to accessibility and network size was employed. <b>The</b> results show <b>accessibility</b> does remain an important factor in predicting which links are connected. Physical difficulties in making connections may have played a role, as well as the potential for adverse economic impacts. National Science Foundatio...|$|R
