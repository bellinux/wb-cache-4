5|$|After graduating, Jones got a {{scholarship}} to attend Louisiana State University (LSU) in Baton Rouge, where one of his brothers played football. He stayed <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> year before joining the U.S. Navy as American involvement in World War II intensified. The Navy transferred him to a V-12 training program at Tulane University in New Orleans, where he played as a halfback and a safety in 1943 and 1944.|$|E
5|$|During the war, 10 {{soldiers}} of the division were awarded the Medal of Honor. They were William F. Dean, George D. Libby, Melvin O. Handrich, Mitchell Red Cloud, Jr., Carl H. Dodd, Nelson V. Brittin, Ray E. Duke, Stanley T. Adams, Mack A. Jordan, and Woodrow W. Keeble. Keeble's medal was awarded on 3 March 2008, 26 years after his death. The 24th Infantry Division suffered 3,735 killed and 7,395 wounded during the Korean War. It remained on front-line duty after the armistice until October 1957, patrolling the 38th parallel {{in the event that}} combat would resume. The division then returned to Japan and remained <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> short time.|$|E
5|$|ETNC's {{early success}} also {{attracted}} the attention of other communities in North Texas, and in 1904 Denison attempted to entice Mayo to relocate the college <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> considerable amount of financial aid. Whether or not Mayo seriously considered the offer is unknown, but he was able to use it as leverage to persuade Commerce to give the college $30,000 {{over the next three years}} for the promise that it would remain, money that was mostly used to renovate and expand ETNC's physical plant.|$|E

5|$|ETNC's {{relative}} success {{during this}} period led to rivalry with other nearby colleges such as T. Henry Bridges' Henry College in Campbell, a 1904 attempt by Denison to entice Mayo to relocate the college <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> considerable amount of financial aid, and praise from perhaps its most famous alumnus, future Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Sam Rayburn. By the time the 35th Texas Legislature voted to buy the college in 1917, it had educated more than 30,000 students, including more public school teachers than any other college or university in Texas during the same period.|$|E
5|$|However records {{indicate}} that Lochner's talent was recognised {{from an early}} age. He may have been of Netherlandish origin or worked <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> master, possibly Robert Campin. Lochner's work seems influenced by Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden; elements of their styles can be detected in the structure and colourisation of Lochner's mature works, especially in his Last Judgment, although neither {{is thought to be}} the master with whom he studied.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, Baeyertz {{returned}} to the United Kingdom, preaching and conducting missions in Ireland, Scotland, and England. There she would preach to packed halls, sometimes to just women, earning £43 in a fortnight (worth about £17,000 in 2014). She remained in her London base until 1904, when she {{returned to}} Australia. Emilia arrived in Perth in May 1904, remaining <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> year before returning to Victoria. Towards the end of her life, she returned to England. She conducted a few missions before her death on 26 April 1926 in Surrey.|$|E

5|$|In 1955, several {{customers}} {{asked if}} Phillips could make demo discs, so {{he bought a}} 1/4inch tape recorder (replaced in 1963 with a Vortexion portable), an MSS (Marguerite Sound Studios - after the owner's wife) disc cutting machine, an amplifier, a 4-track mixer, three microphones (a Reslo, an HMV ribbon microphone, and an AKG), and three pairs of headphones for £400, while {{on a trip to}} London to visit his son Frank, who was <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sound recording course at EMI Electronics.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the operation of Mountain Grove Campground, the majority of people traveling there were worshipers. In the 1870s and 1880s, the campground was one of the three largest camp meeting sites that residents of Columbia County attended. In 1875, approximately 2500 people attended the camp meeting. In 1881, it was decided that all the profit generated from the campground would be dedicated to expansion and improvement of it. In 1891, the duration of the camp meeting was increased from seven to thirteen days. However, some people traveled <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> vacation. Within 20 years of the campground's opening, {{the majority of the people}} going there were <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> vacation, and trains carried bands and other entertainment-related items to the campground. However, people still continued to go there in large numbers for camp meeting. Local newspapers also began to advertise the campground as a resort instead of a camp meeting site. This began with an advertisement written by John R. Rote, secretary of the Mountain Grove Camp Meeting Association, in the Columbia County Republican on July 9, 1891.|$|E

5|$|Kaiser and Deutschland {{were placed}} in reserve after the 1878 {{maneuvers}} were cancelled and remained <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> decade, {{with the exception of}} the 1883 maneuvers. During the maneuvers, both ships' steam engines proved troublesome, and indeed forced a temporary halt to the training exercises when they simultaneously broke down. The two ships were reactivated in 1889 to participate in cruises following the coronation of Kaiser Wilhelm II. These included a state visit to Great Britain in August 1889 and a tour of the Mediterranean in the winter of 1889–1890.|$|E
5|$|Loring {{was planned}} in 1947 as Limestone Army Air Field and was {{designed}} with {{a capacity of}} over 100 B-36 Peacemaker strategic bombers. This plan was only partially completed due to budget constraints, but, over time, Loring {{became one of the}} largest air bases of SAC. After the B-36 was phased out, the B-52 Stratofortress was based at Loring, first with D models, then with B-52Gs. The Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter was also based <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> number of years, until it was replaced by the better-known KC-135A Stratotanker.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the first}} Marshalsea, as with the second, was taken up by debtors; in 1773 debtors within 12 miles of Westminster could be imprisoned <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> debt of 40 shillings. Jerry White writes that London's poorest debtors were housed in the Marshalsea. Wealthier debtors secured their removal from the Marshalsea by writ of habeas corpus, and {{arranged}} to be moved to the Fleet or King's Bench, {{both of which were}} more comfortable. The prison also held a small number of men being tried at the Old Bailey for crimes at sea.|$|E

She visited Usworth Comprehensive in 2003, as guest of honour at a prize-giving event and to support the school against plans for its closure.|$|E
5|$|The stadium {{has hosted}} Premier League {{football}} {{for most of}} its existence; although Sunderland had been relegated {{at the end of the}} season preceding its opening, they won promotion with a then English professional record of 105 league points in their second season there. Sunderland then survived for four seasons in the Premier League before being relegated in 2003. They returned to the Premier League at the second attempt, and despite being relegated the following season, they made an instant return to the Premier League in 2007 and survived <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> decade.|$|E

5|$|Tucker {{relocated}} {{his family}} in 1806, including a newborn daughter Maria, to the Carters' home in Frederick County, Virginia, and attempted to put his financial house in order.

The immediate problem was solved with the intervention of St. George. Tucker economized for two years, living a rural life with the Carters and other family {{and was able to}} purchase a home near the Dan River.|$|E
