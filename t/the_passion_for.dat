Destiny made us women {{at a time when}} the law of men is the only law that is recognized." [...] She also wrote Lettres à une Connue (Letters to a Woman I Have Known), her own epistolary novel about the affair. Although Barney failed to find a publisher for the book and later called it naïve and clumsy, it is notable for its discussion of homosexuality, which Barney regarded as natural and compared to albinism.

However, according to Bhandarkar the film was [...] "not about [...] fashion industry as such. It only has fashion as a backdrop. The film is more about the story of models, designers and people.

[...] Critics also {{said that the}} film explores drug abuse, homosexuality and gay relationships.

500|$|After {{taking a}} five-month hiatus at the {{beginning}} of 2006, From Autumn to Ashes returned and played the length of the 2006 Vans Warped Tour, adding Rob Lauritsen in place of Cox. In September 2006, the band rented practice space and began writing material for what would become Holding a Wolf by the Ears. Brian McTernan was chosen as producer because he had previously worked with Mark and Newton on their side project Biology's album, and the members opted for this release to have a less refined feel than the last albums. As From Autumn to Ashes prepared to begin studio recording for the album, Mark noted that Perri [...] "never came out to any of the practices and he had no involvement. But that was also the way it was when we wrote Abandon Your Friends." [...] Perri had then declared that he would no longer {{be a part of the}} band. [...] As Mark explains, [...] "I thought there was a more considerate way he could have gone about leaving the band", but it was ultimately [...] "cool of him to recognize that he just didn't have <b>the</b> <b>passion</b> <b>for</b> the band anymore." [...] Deciding to move on without Perri as a member, Mark then became lead vocalist, providing both clean and screaming vocals in addition to his already recorded drums. [...] Mark, as the band's lyricist explained that he [...] "work very hard and writing and revising very personal lyrics" [...] and found that a part of him did not want to hand over the lyrics to another to sing, however, with Perri's departure and when Mark began recording vocal tracks, [...] "It immediately seemed like that’s the way things had been all along". Mark stated the bulk of the album's lyrics had been [...] "just about living" [...] and [...] "the idea that extremes are dangerous." [...] Recorded in about a month's time, Holding a Wolf by the Ears was named for the quotation by Thomas Jefferson, [...] "But as it is, we have the wolf by the ear, and we can neither hold him, nor safely let him go. Justice is in one scale, and self-preservation in the other." [...] Reviewer Drew Beringer of Absolute Punk had praised the change in the band's line up, stating that [...] "Mark is three times the front man Perri was", and gave [...] "passion that had been severely lacking while Perri was in the band." ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{reaction}} {{was met with}} a virulent reply by Iorga, whose renewed accusations borrowed from antisemitic discourse: [...] " [...] about many things {{that he does not}} comprehend.

We all know that Mr. Șăineanu is not a Romanian, and we know that which he is. His people has many traits that are very elevated and noble, but also many defects that are low and ungainly. These, I had been telling myself, are in his blood; he could never get rid of them.

In 1907, Iorga and his Neamul Românesc journal also retorted against Caragiale's praise for Șăineanu, calling Caragiale one who [...] "deals with the Jews", and prompting Caragiale to satirize Iorga's own scholarly ambitions.|$|E

[...] In the 1860s, the anti-trundling campaign was taken up by Charles Babbage, who blamed the boys for driving iron hoops under horses' legs, with the result that the rider is thrown and very often the horse breaks a leg. Babbage achieved a certain notoriety in this matter, being denounced in debate in Commons in 1864 for [...] "commencing a crusade against the popular game of tip-cat and the trundling of hoops." ...|$|E
