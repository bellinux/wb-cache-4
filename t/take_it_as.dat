Many people {{in high school and}} colleges wanting to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a foreign language, but until recently, it was not a creditable foreign language elective. The issue was that many didn't consider it a foreign language. ASL users, however, have a very distinct culture and way they interact when talking. Their facial expressions and hand movements reflect what they are conveying. They also have their own sentence structure which sets the language apart.|$|E

40|$|There {{are three}} main {{traditional}} accounts of vagueness : one <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a genuinely metaphysical phenomenon, one <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> {{a phenomenon of}} ignorance, and one <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a linguistic or conceptual phenomenon. In this paper I first very briefly present these views, especially the epistemicist and supervaluationist strategies, and shortly point to some well-known problems that the views carry. I then examine a 'statistical epistemicist' account of vagueness {{that is designed to}} avoid precisely these problems – it will be a view that provides an account of the phenomenon of vagueness as coming from our linguistic practices, while insisting that meaning supervenes on use, and that our use of vague terms does yield sharp and precise meanings, which we ignore, thus allowing bivalence to hold...|$|R

25|$|The modern {{scholarly}} {{consensus is}} that {{the doctrine of the}} virgin birth rests on a very slim historical foundation. However, some writers <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> significant that the virgin birth is attested by two separate gospels, although the details of each vary. In this view, the virgin conception and birth constitute a tradition that fits within the criterion of multiple attestation, because the accounts of Matthew and Luke are taken as two independent testimonies of the tradition.|$|E
25|$|Dealing {{does not}} have to be {{strictly}} this way and may be done quite differently based on house rules. Tiles may flip over when being dealt and players should agree in advance on how to deal with the problem. Solutions include having the dealer penalised points, shuffling the turned over piece back into the wall somehow, allowing the player who the tiles were dealt to take the piece or not (meaning the dealer must <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> his/her 14th piece) or other house rules.|$|E
25|$|On Blanshard's view, the Absolute is {{thus not}} merely {{consistent}} (i.e., noncontradictory) but positively coherent, {{shot through with}} relations of necessity and indeed operating purely deterministically. (Blanshard held the law of causality, properly understood, to be a logical law and believed that effects logically determine their causes as well as vice versa.) Strictly speaking, he admitted, we cannot prove {{that there are no}} atomic facts, bare conjunctions, or sheer surds in nature, but we can <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> our working hypothesis that relations of necessity are always to be found; until and unless this hypothesis meets with absolute defeat, we are justified in adopting it at least provisionally.|$|E

25|$|Compared {{to some of}} its {{relatives}} {{like the}} sparsely-spotted stingaree (U. paucimaculatus), the spotted stingaree is less aggressive when disturbed by humans. There is little to no fishing activity across most of this species' range, and its preference for rocky habitats mostly protect it from bottom trawls. The Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF) <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> bycatch, but not in significant numbers. It may potentially be affected by habitat degradation or recreational fishing. Given that it is little threatened by human activity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the spotted stingaree as of Least Concern. The range of this species encompasses {{a number of small}} Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), and it would potentially benefit from the implementation of the 2004 Australian National Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks.|$|E
25|$|During World War 1, a {{significant}} number of former pupils of the school went to fight in the war, as part of the 200,000 Irishmen who participated in the war effort. The Dún Laoghaire area suffered over 500 military fatalities during the war, with {{a significant}} number of these coming from school. Owing to this, people in Flanders sent a statue to the area to honour the dead. It was felt {{at the time that the}} school should <b>take</b> <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> so many of the fatalities were from the school. With the changing political environment at the time however, with the Irish War of Independence underway, this was declined by the school. The statue was instead housed in the Dominican Covent in the town, where it resides still to this day in an oratory purposely designed for it.|$|E
25|$|When Tiffany Raymond reappears, Natalie feels sidelined by Bianca {{as she did}} in school. Bianca's boyfriend Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) also {{tires of}} Bianca's {{selfishness}} and this inadvertently drives him and Natalie closer together. They console each other and in February 1995, they begin an affair. Ricky is Natalie's first sexual partner and for her it is true love, but Ricky does not <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> seriously. Natalie starts pressuring Ricky to tell Bianca about their relationship {{and when he does}} not, Natalie plants some lingerie in his work overalls. Bianca finds it and suspects Ricky is having an affair; she takes Natalie's advice to follow Ricky so she can catch him with the mystery woman. Bianca does this one night and catches them kissing and is incensed. In the aftermath, Ricky dumps Natalie and Bianca threatens her, ordering her to leave Walford. Dejected, Natalie does so, leaving Walford to stay with her sister in Basingstoke.|$|E
