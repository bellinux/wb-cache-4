5|$|Since camels have a {{slow growth}} rate; they reach sexual {{maturity}} only in advanced years. The age of sexual maturity varies geographically and depends on <b>the</b> <b>individual,</b> <b>as</b> does the reproductive period. Both sexes might mature by {{three to five}} years of age, though successful breeding could take longer. Mating occurs once a year, and peaks in the rainy season. The mating season lasts three to five months, but may last a year for older animals.|$|E
5|$|Counseling {{about sex}} and {{sexuality}} by medical professionals, psychologists, social workers, and nurses {{is a part of}} most SCI rehabilitation programs. Education is part of the follow-up treatment for people with SCI, as are psychotherapy, peer mentorship, and social activities; these are helpful for improving skills needed for socializing and relationships. Rather than addressing sexual dysfunction strictly as a physical problem, appropriate sexual rehabilitation care takes into account <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>as</b> a whole, for example addressing issues with relationships and self-esteem. Sexual counseling includes teaching techniques to manage depression and stress, and to increase attention to preserved sensations during sexual activity. Education includes information about birth control or assistive devices such as those for positioning in sex, or advice and ideas for addressing problems such as incontinence and autonomic dysreflexia.|$|E
5|$|Literary critic Todd Garth {{argues that}} I, the Supreme is {{influenced}} by twentieth-century Argentine writer Macedonio Fernández, {{as well as other}} avant garde artists such as Jorge Luis Borges and Julio Cortázar. Garth suggests that Macedonio and Roa Bastos are similar in use of metaphysical language and techniques used to reconstruct reality, as Dr. Francia does in his dictated creation of the Supreme, the ruler of all reality. Macedonio's writing utilized characters that did not fit the archetype of Western fiction, each only having meaning through their interaction with others in a collective and often never experiencing growth or development in order to construct atemporal spaces of mythmaking that challenge reality. Roa Bastos borrows from these ideas yet situates them in existing political and social history to challenge perceived conceptions of the past's factuality. He dismantles national Paraguayan mythology which is so intimately intertwined with the life of Dr. Francia, elucidating the distinctions between mythic and mythological. The novel can only accomplish this task within the metaphysical space of mythmaking. Whereas Macedonio attacks the concept of <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>as</b> subject while admitting the fact that to write makes oneself a subject, Roa Bastos recognizes this paradox and exploits it, utilizing it in concerns of political and social nature.|$|E

5|$|When Joan {{comes to}} speak with Charles, the Dauphin pretends to be a common member of the court while someone else pretends to be him. Joan is able {{to see through the}} ruse and {{immediately}} proclaims that she is sent to restore the French crown to him at Rheims. Charles has her examined by priests and scholars to determine that she is free of black magic. While questioned, Joan describes how God came to her with visions and describes her faith in a similar manner to deism. This causes the examiners to believe that she is a heretic until a blue flame appears along with a sound, which is enough to silence any doubts about her faith. The flame reveals a suit of armour for her, but one individual interrupts her immediate donning of the armour to claim that France is cursed and that she would be a victim. <b>The</b> <b>individual,</b> <b>as</b> it turns out, is Conrade, who blames himself that Joan left her peaceful life to help a French court that was corrupt. He also warns her that he experienced a vision of her burning at the stake.|$|E

25|$|A modern {{concept that}} God {{is in need}} of human beings has been propounded by Abraham Joshua Heschel. Because God is in search of people, God is {{accessible}} and available through time and place to whoever seeks Him, leading to a spiritual intensity for <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>as</b> well. This accessibility leads to a God who is present, involved, near, intimate, and concerned for and vulnerable to what happens in this world.|$|E

However, this generally relates to the free radicals generated in the body, not the free radicals consumed by <b>the</b> <b>individual,</b> <b>as</b> much of these are destroyed in the digestive process.|$|E

25|$|Vallabhacharya (1479–1531 CE), the {{proponent of}} the {{philosophy}} of Shuddhadvaita Brahmvad enunciates that Ishvara has created the world without connection with any external agency such as Maya (which itself is his power) and manifests Himself through the world. That is why shuddhadvaita is known as ‘Unmodified transformation’ or ‘Avikṛta Pariṇāmavāda’. Brahman or Ishvara desired to become many, and he became the multitude of individual souls and the world. Vallabha recognises Brahman as the whole and <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>as</b> a ‘part’ (but devoid of bliss).|$|E
25|$|Incentive {{theory in}} {{psychology}} treats motivation {{and behavior of}} <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>as</b> they are influenced by beliefs, such as engaging in activities {{that are expected to}} be profitable. Incentive theory is promoted by behavioral psychologists, such as B.F. Skinner. Incentive theory is especially supported by Skinner in his philosophy of Radical behaviorism, meaning that a person's actions always have social ramifications: and if actions are positively received {{people are more likely to}} act in this manner, or if negatively received people are less likely to act in this manner.|$|E
25|$|Another key {{aspect of}} Reform {{doctrine}} is the personal autonomy of each adherent, who may formulate his own understanding and expression of his religiosity. Reform is unique among all Jewish denominations in placing <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>as</b> the authorized interpreter of Judaism. This position was originally influenced by Kantian philosophy {{and the great}} weight it lent to personal judgement and free will. This highly individualistic stance also proved one of the movement's great challenges, for it impeded the creation of clear guidelines and standards for positive participation in religious life and definition of what was expected from members.|$|E

25|$|Jefferson was {{the primary}} author of the Declaration of Independence. At age 33, {{he was one of}} the {{youngest}} delegates to the Second Continental Congress beginning in 1775 at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, where a formal declaration of independence from Britain was overwhelmingly favored. Jefferson chose his words for the Declaration in June 1775, shortly after the war had begun, where the idea of Independence from Britain had long since become popular among the colonies. He was inspired by the Enlightenment ideals of the sanctity of <b>the</b> <b>individual,</b> <b>as</b> well as by the writings of Locke and Montesquieu.|$|E
25|$|Human {{security}} is {{indebted to the}} human rights tradition (the ideas of natural law and natural rights). The development of the human security model {{can be seen to}} have drawn upon ideas and concepts fundamental to the human rights tradition. Both approaches use <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>as</b> the main referent and both argue that {{a wide range of issues}} (i.e. civil rights, cultural identity, access to education and healthcare) are fundamental to human dignity. A major difference between the two models is in their approach to addressing threats to human dignity and survival. Whilst the human rights framework takes a legalistic approach, the human security framework, by utilizing a diverse range of actors, adopts flexible and issue-specific approaches, which can operate at local, national or international levels.|$|E
