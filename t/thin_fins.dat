40|$|In this paper, a {{two-dimensional}} numerical simulation {{is carried out}} to investigate the thermal boundary layer flow in a differentially heated cavity with a <b>thin</b> <b>fin</b> at the mid height of the hot wall. It is found that the <b>thin</b> <b>fin</b> changes the transition of the thermal boundary layer flow. In the initial stage, a lower intrusion front forms, bypasses the <b>thin</b> <b>fin,</b> and strikes the intrusion under the ceiling. After the lower intrusion front is convected away, the trailing flow behind it reattaches to the thermal boundary layer. As the stratification in the cavity is enforced, the separation and shedding of the flow around the <b>thin</b> <b>fin</b> become unstable, and thus induce the instability of the thermal boundary layer flow. The transition of the thermal boundary layer flow ultimately approaches a periodic flow in the quasi-steady stage. Due to the instability of the thermal boundary layer triggered by the fin, the heat transfer through the hot wall is significantly enhanced...|$|R
40|$|The {{transient}} flow around a <b>thin</b> <b>fin</b> on the sidewall in a differentially heated cavity is visualized using a shadowgraph technique. The transition {{of the flow}} from sudden heating to a quasi-steady state may be classified into three stages: an early stage, a transitional stage and a quasi-steady stage. Such classifications {{are similar to those}} in the case with a smaller square fin on the sidewall (Xu et aL, 2006). However, there are distinct differences of the flow features between the cases with a small square fin and a larger <b>thin</b> <b>fin.</b> In the early stage, a lower intrusion front forms below the fin which induces strong turbulent mixing downstream of the fin and is convected away. In the transitional stage, as the fluid in the cavity is stratified, the flow around the <b>thin</b> <b>fin</b> separates and oscillates. The oscillations break the double-layer structure of the downstream thermal boundary layer adjacent to the sidewall in the quasi-steady stage. It is found that the separation and oscillations of the flow around the <b>thin</b> <b>fin</b> are dependent on the geometry of the fin. The frequency of oscillations has a good linear correlation with the Rayleigh number, but is lower than that of unstable travelling waves in the thermal boundary layer for the case without a fin (approximately 1 / 2) ...|$|R

5000|$|A modern variant {{between the}} Foster slug and the sabot slug is the wad slug, {{sometimes}} called a [...] "drive key slug", {{or just a}} [...] "key slug". This {{is a type of}} shotgun slug designed to be fired through a smoothbore shotgun barrel. Like the traditional Foster slug, a deep hollow is located in the rear of this slug, which serves to retain the center of mass near the front tip of the slug much like the Foster slug. However, unlike the Foster slug, a wad slug additionally has a key or web wall molded across the deep hollow, spanning the hollow, which serves to increase the structural integrity of the slug while also reducing the amount of expansion of the slug when fired, reducing the stress on the shot wad in which it rides down a barrel. Also, unlike Foster slugs that have <b>thin</b> <b>fins</b> {{on the outside of the}} slug, much like those on the Brenneke, the wad slug is shaped with an ogive or bullet shape, with a smooth outer surface. The wad slug is loaded using a standard shotshell wad, which acts like a sabot. The diameter of the wad slug is slightly less than the nominal bore diameter, being around 0.690 inch for a 12-gauge wad slug, and a wad slug is generally cast solely from pure lead, necessary for increasing safety if the slug is ever fired through a choked shotgun. Common 12 gauge wad slug masses include -oz. and 1-oz. wad slugs, and they are loaded in a traditional shotshell wad intended for variously loading among -oz., 1-oz., or 1-oz. shotshells. Depending on the specific stack-up, a card wad is also sometimes located between the slug and the shotshell wad, depending largely on which hull is specified, with the primary intended purpose of improving fold crimps on the loaded wad slug shell that serves to regulate fired shotshell pressures and improve accuracy.|$|E

40|$|Room {{acoustic}} diffusers {{can be used}} {{to treat}} critical listening environments to improve sound quality. One popular class is Schroeder diffusers, which comprise wells of varying depth separated by <b>thin</b> <b>fins.</b> This paper concerns a new approach to enable the modelling of these complex surfaces in the time domain. Mostly, diffuser scattering is predicted using steady-state, single frequency methods. A popular approach is to use a frequency domain Boundary Element Method (BEM) model of a box containing the diffuser, where the mouth of each well is replaced by a compliant surface with appropriate surface impedance. The best way of representing compliant surfaces in time domain prediction models, such as the transient BEM is, however, currently unresolved. A representation based on surface impedance yields convolution kernels which involve future sound, so is not compatible with the current generation of time-marching transient BEM solvers. Consequently, this paper proposes the use of a surface reflection kernel for modelling well behaviour and this is tested in a time domain BEM implementation. The new algorithm is verified on two surfaces including a Schroeder diffuser model and accurate results are obtained. It is hoped that this representation may be extended to arbitrary compliant locally reacting materials...|$|E
40|$|Boundary Element Methods (BEMs) {{may be used}} {{to predict}} the {{scattering}} of sound by obstacles, which has accelerated the prototyping of new room acoustic treatments such as diffusers. Unlike the more popular frequency domain method, the time domain BEM is usually solved in an iterative manner which means it can exhibit instability, a crucial impediment to its widespread use. These instabilities are primarily associated with the resonance of cavities formed by closed surface sections, but may also be caused by discretisation or integration error corrupting physical damped resonances. Regular BEM implementations cannot model objects with thin sections due to a phenomenon known as Thin Shape Breakdown. This paper develops an algorithm which combines an accepted approach for modelling thin plates with the Combined Field Integral Equation which eradicates cavity resonances, thereby permitting models of mixed regular and thin bodies. Accuracy and stability are tested by comparison to verified frequency domain BEMs, examination of the transient response, and pole decomposition. This is done for a simple obstacle and a Schroeder diffuser, which comprises a series of wells separated by <b>thin</b> <b>fins.</b> The approach is successful but universal stability cannot be guaranteed for the diffuser. It is suggested that instability is caused by the lightly damped resonances of the wells being corrupted into divergent behaviour by numerical errors...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of <b>thin</b> <b>fins</b> {{has generally been}} done by considering one-dimensional (1 -D) heat conduction in fins. The condition for 1 -D heat conduction for dry surfaces has been reported by many researchers. However, {{in the case of}} refrigeration and air conditioning applications, fin surface becomes wet due to the condensation of moisture on the surfaces. For the wet surface, no analysis has so far been conducted with considering two-dimensional (2 -D) heat conduction in a fin. The present paper aims to determine analytically the temperature distribution for 2 -D heat conduction in wet fins. Modified one-dimensional method is proposed appropriately for the solution of the two-dimensional heat conduction in the fin based on a trapezoidal rule. From the results, it can be highlighted that the modified 1 -D model matches closely with the 2 -D model. It has also been observed that under any design condition, 1 -D classical model does not have capacity to predict the accurate result for thermal performance and local optimization parameters. In any range of Bi, modified 1 -D model determines the heat transfer exactly with that by the 2 -D model. This investigation also shows {{that there is no such}} condition found for the global optimization: the heat transfer rate and the fin efficiency always increase with Bi which may be extremely important aspect in a practical design to be selected Bi in an application. On the other hand, it can be demonstrated that this design condition for optimization has never been studied in the literature of fin heat transfer before. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This {{article was}} {{published}} in the Journal of Heat Transfer [© American Society of Mechanical Engineers] and the definitive version is available from the ASME Digital Library at: [URL] computational study of steady, laminar, natural convective fluid flow in a partially open square enclosure with a highly conductive <b>thin</b> <b>fin</b> of arbitrary length attached to the hot wall at various levels is considered. The horizontal walls and the partially open vertical wall are adiabatic while the vertical wall facing the partial opening is isothermally hot. The current work investigates the flow modification due to the (a) attachment of a highly conductive <b>thin</b> <b>fin</b> of length equal to 20 %, 35 %, or 50 % of the enclosure width, attached to the hot wall at different heights, and (b) variation of the size and height of the aperture located on the vertical wall facing the hot wall. Furthermore, the study examines the impact of Rayleigh number (104 Ra 107) and inclination of the enclosure. The problem is put into dimensionless formulation and solved numerically by means of the finite-volume method. The results show that the presence of the fin has counteracting effects on flow and temperature fields. These effects are dependent, in a complex way, on the fin level and length, aperture altitude and size, cavity inclination angle, and Rayleigh number. In general, Nusselt number is directly related to aperture altitude and size. However, after reaching a peak Nusselt number, Nusselt number may decrease slightly if the aperture's size increases further. The impact of aperture altitude diminishes for large aperture sizes because the geometrical differences decrease. Furthermore, a longer fin causes higher rate of heat transfer to the fluid, although the equivalent finless cavity may have higher heat transfer rate. In general, the volumetric flow rate and the rate of heat loss from the hot surfaces are interrelated and are increasing functions of Rayleigh number. The relationship between Nusselt number and the inclination angle is nonlinear...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{improving}} {{the suitability of}} the time domain Boundary Element Method (BEM) for predicting the scattering from surface treatments used to improve the acoustics of rooms. The discretised integral equations are typically solved by marching on in time from initial silence; however, this being iterative has potential for divergence. Such instability and high computational cost have prohibited the time domain BEM from widespread use. The underlying integral equation is known to not possess unique solutions at certain frequencies, physically interpreted as cavity resonances, and these manifest as resonant poles, all excited and potentially divergent due to numerical error. This has been addressed by others using the combined field integral equation; an approach built upon in this thesis. Accuracy and stability may also be compromised by poor discretisation and integration accuracy. The latter is investigated on real-world surfaces, demonstrating that the popular Gaussian integration schemes are not suitable in some circumstances. Instead a contour integration scheme capable of resolving the integrands‟ singular nature is developed. Schroeder diffusers are Room Acoustic treatments which comprise wells separated by <b>thin</b> <b>fins.</b> The algorithm is extended to model such surfaces, applying the combined field integral equation to the body and an open surface model to the fins. It is shown that this improves stability over an all open surface model. A new model for compliant surfaces is developed, comparable to the surface impedance model used in the frequency domain. This is implemented for surfaces with welled and absorbing sections, permitting modelling of a Schroeder diffuser as a box with surface impedances that simulate the delayed reflections caused by the wells. A Binary Amplitude Diffuser - a partially absorbing diffuser - is also modelled. These new models achieve good accuracy but not universal stability and avenues of future research are proposed to address the latter issue.
