5|$|There {{are three}} {{commonly}} used configurations of manifold. The oldest type is a tube with a connector on each end which {{is attached to}} the cylinder valve outlet, and an outlet connection in the middle, to which the regulator is attached. A variation on this pattern includes a reserve valve at the outlet connector. <b>The</b> <b>cylinders</b> are isolated from the manifold when closed, and the manifold can be attached or disconnected while <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> are pressurised.|$|E
5|$|A simple model which predicts lyotropic phase {{transitions}} is the hard-rod model {{proposed by}} Lars Onsager. This theory considers the volume {{excluded from the}} center-of-mass of one idealized cylinder as it approaches another. Specifically, if <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> are oriented parallel to one another, {{there is very little}} volume that is excluded from the center-of-mass of the approaching cylinder (it can come quite close to the other cylinder). If, however, <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> are at some angle to one another, then there is a large volume surrounding the cylinder which the approaching cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a decrease in the net positional entropy of the approaching cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).|$|E
40|$|The flow {{around a}} {{circular}} cylinder {{placed in a}} plane wall jet was investigated experimentally. The effect on <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> of <b>the</b> velocity gradient, the turbulent intensity and the ratio of thickness of the wall jet to <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> diameter was estimated by changing distance between <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> and <b>the</b> flat plate and <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> diameter. <b>The</b> {{results show that the}} front stagnation point on <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> is shifted towards under side of <b>the</b> <b>cylinder.</b> <b>The</b> lift acting on <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> due to <b>the</b> shift of the front stagnation point increases as shear parameter increases. The drag acting on <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> decreases as turbulent intensity increases. Pressure distributions along the flat plate appear similar configurations with changing diameter of <b>the</b> circulrr <b>cylinder...</b>|$|R

5000|$|A {{longitudinal}} {{magnetic field}} is produced inside a hollow metallic conductor, by discharging {{a bank of}} capacitors into the solenoid that surrounds <b>the</b> <b>cylinder.</b> To ensure a rapid penetration of the field in <b>the</b> <b>cylinder,</b> there is a slit in <b>the</b> <b>cylinder,</b> which closes rapidly as <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> deforms; ...|$|R
5|$|Diving bells are {{required}} to carry an onboard supply of breathing gas for use in emergencies. <b>The</b> <b>cylinders</b> are mounted externally as there is insufficient space inside. They are fully immersed in the water during bell operations, and may be considered diving cylinders.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{manifolds}} {{have become}} available which connect <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> on the cylinder {{side of the}} valve, leaving the outlet connection of the cylinder valve available for connection of a regulator. This means that the connection cannot be made or broken while <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> are pressurised, {{as there is no}} valve to isolate the manifold from the interior of the cylinder. This apparent inconvenience allows a regulator to be connected to each cylinder, and isolated from the internal pressure independently, which allows a malfunctioning regulator on one cylinder to be isolated while still allowing the regulator on the other cylinder access to all the gas in both cylinders. These manifolds may be plain or may include an isolation valve in the manifold, which allows the contents of <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> to be isolated from each other. This allows the contents of one cylinder to be isolated and secured for the diver if a leak at the cylinder neck thread, manifold connection, or burst disk on the other cylinder causes its contents to be lost. A relatively uncommon manifold system is a connection which screws directly into the neck threads of both cylinders, and has a single valve to release gas to a connector for a regulator. These manifolds can include a reserve valve, either in the main valve or at one cylinder. This system is mainly of historical interest.|$|E
5|$|The Wrights {{wrote to}} several engine manufacturers, but none met {{their need for}} a {{sufficiently}} lightweight powerplant. They turned to their shop mechanic, Charlie Taylor, who built an engine in just six weeks in close consultation with the brothers. To keep the weight low enough, the engine block was cast from aluminum, a rare practice for the time. The Wright/Taylor engine had a primitive version of a carburetor, and had no fuel pump. Gasoline was gravity-fed from the fuel tank mounted on a wing strut into a chamber next to <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> where it was mixed with air: the fuel-air mixture was then vaporized by heat from the crankcase, forcing it into <b>the</b> <b>cylinders.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cylindric {{sections}} are <b>the</b> intersections of <b>cylinders</b> with planes. For a right circular cylinder, {{there are}} four possibilities. A plane tangent to <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> meets <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> in a single straight line segment. Moved while parallel to itself, the plane either does not intersect <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> or intersects it in two parallel line segments.

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a piezoelectric sensor {{to pick up}} compression oscillations from combustion engines and its force-fitted clamped arrangement {{in the region of}} <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> head gasket between <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> block and <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> head, characterized by the following features: the piezoelectric component (4) is secured permanently to a fixed axial housing wall (2 a) within a housing (2) whose thickness is definable; said housing wall (2 a) is located in a directly or indirectly elastic clamping arrangement against one of the sealing surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> block (20) or cylinder head (21) adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> head gasket (11).

5|$|As mentioned, the British Railways batch had detail {{differences}} to previous versions. The most significant modification was {{the reduction of}} weight using lighter materials unavailable during wartime. From 1952 the air-smoothed casing ahead of <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> was removed to ease maintenance and lubrication. This coincided with {{the removal of the}} tender 'raves' on all locomotives, as they obstructed the packing of coal into the bunker and restricted the driver's view when reversing the locomotive. The resultant 'cut-down' tender included new, enclosed storage for fire-irons, revised step ladders and glass spectacle plates to protect the crew from flying coal dust when running tender-first.|$|E
5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} {{are manufactured}} with domed (convex) and dished (concave) bottoms. The dished profile {{allows them to}} stand upright on a horizontal surface, and is the standard shape for industrial cylinders. <b>The</b> <b>cylinders</b> used for emergency gas supply on diving bells are often this shape, and commonly have a water capacity of about 50 litres ("J"). Domed bottoms give a larger volume for the same cylinder mass, and are the standard for scuba cylinders up to 18 litres water capacity, though some concave bottomed cylinders have been marketed for scuba.|$|E
5|$|The three {{cylinders}} of each bogie {{were cast}} in mono-block format, each surrounded by two annular inlet steam chests {{and a single}} large outlet steam chest. These had the added function of keeping the cylinder heated by hot steam to maintain the temperature and pressure of steam entering <b>the</b> <b>cylinders.</b> However, these castings were difficult to machine accurately. The steam-sealing arrangements needed for this system were also complex, {{with each of the}} six cylinders and valve sleeves requiring 24 sealing rings.|$|E
50|$|A {{consistent}} lockup {{is important}} to keep all these parts in line, and revolvers are prone to abuse that can damage these parts, adversely affecting the accuracy and even safety of the revolver. This lockup consists of two parts, the crane to frame lockup, and <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> bolt to cylinder lockup. Many swing-out cylinder revolvers only support <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> securely at <b>the</b> rear, and flipping <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> open and closed can bend the crane and prevent <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> from lining up parallel to <b>the</b> bore. <b>The</b> <b>cylinder</b> bolt, which engages the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> through a slot in the frame, should provide a relatively tight lockup, and not drag <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> during rotation or pop loose when the hammer is cocked at a reasonable speed. Fanning a revolver can batter <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> bolt and prevent a solid lockup.|$|R

50|$|Some larger {{diesel engines}} suffer from {{cavitation}} {{due to high}} compression and undersized cylinder walls. Vibrations of <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> wall induce alternating low and high pressure in the coolant against <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> wall. <b>The</b> result is pitting of <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> wall, which will eventually let cooling fluid leak into <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> and combustion gases to leak into the coolant.|$|R
5|$|Many {{superficial}} inspections {{were performed}} on the locomotive in 1980 and it {{was found to be}} in relatively sound mechanical condition. There wasn't a significant amount of deterioration noted in these early inspections, and when the wheels were jacked off the rails, as they had been 50 years earlier, the axles were found to be freely operable. One morning in January 1980, before the museum opened to the public, museum officials used compressed air to power <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> and move the wheels through the connecting rods {{for the first time since}} its last semi-operation. After the compressed air blew some dirt and debris out of the locomotive's exhaust stack, it was soon running smoothly.|$|E
5|$|Open circuit scuba divers by {{definition}} {{are independent of}} surface supply, and must take any gas mixture with them {{that is to be}} used on the dive. However, if they are confident of returning by a specific route, the decompression gas may be stored at appropriate places on that route. <b>The</b> <b>cylinders</b> used for this purpose are called stage cylinders, and they are usually provided with a standard regulator and a submersible pressure gauge, and are usually left at the stop with the regulator pressurized, but the cylinder valve turned off to minimize the risk of gas loss. Similar cylinders are carried by the divers when the route back is not secure. They are commonly mounted as sling cylinders, clipped to D-rings at the sides of the diver's harness.|$|E
5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} may {{be manufactured}} from steel plate discs, which are cold {{drawn to a}} cylindrical cup form, {{in two or three}} stages, and generally have a domed base if intended for the scuba market, so they cannot stand up by themselves. After forming the base and side walls, the top of the cylinder is trimmed to length, heated and hot spun to form the shoulder and close the neck. This process thickens the material of the shoulder. The cylinder is heat-treated by quenching and tempering to provide the best strength and toughness. <b>The</b> <b>cylinders</b> are machined to provide the neck thread and o-ring seat (if applicable), then chemically cleaned or shot-blasted inside and out to remove mill-scale. After inspection and hydrostatic testing they are stamped with the required permanent markings, followed by external coating with a corrosion barrier paint or hot dip galvanising.|$|E
50|$|A {{differential}} cylinder {{acts like a}} normal cylinder when pulling. If <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> however has to push, the oil from the piston rod side of <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> is not returned to the reservoir, but goes to the bottom side of <b>the</b> <b>cylinder.</b> In such a way, <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> goes much faster, but the maximum force <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> can give is like a plunger cylinder. A {{differential cylinder}} can be manufactured like a normal cylinder, and only a special control is added.|$|R
25|$|Steam {{was drawn}} from the boiler to <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> under <b>the</b> piston. When the piston {{reached the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>cylinder,</b> <b>the</b> steam inlet valve closed and the valve {{controlling}} the passage to the condenser opened. The condenser being at a lower pressure, drew the steam from <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> into <b>the</b> condenser where it cooled and condensed from water vapor to liquid water, maintaining a partial vacuum in the condenser that was communicated to the space of <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> by <b>the</b> connecting passage.

5000|$|... ===Exhaust stroke=== The {{exhaust stroke}} {{is the fourth}} of four stages in a four stroke {{internal}} combustion engine cycle. In this stage gases remaining in <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> from <b>the</b> fuel ignited during the compression step are removed from <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> through an exhaust valve {{at the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>cylinder.</b> <b>The</b> gases are forced {{up to the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> as <b>the</b> piston rises and are pushed through the opening, which then closes to allow a fresh air/fuel mixture into <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> so <b>the</b> process can repeat itself.|$|R
5|$|The {{valve gear}} that was settled upon was a {{modified}} form of Caprotti valve gear, the novel rotary cam-driven British Caprotti valve gear developed by Heenan & Froude with poppet valves. This {{was based on}} Italian locomotive practice and allowed precise control of steam admission to <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> while improving exhaust flow and boiler draughting characteristics {{when compared to the}} more conventional Walschaerts and Stephenson valve gear. On paper this created a free-steaming, hard-working locomotive capable of hauling heavy loads over long distances but, in practice, fundamental design errors and undetected deviations from the drawings made during construction combined to prevent the locomotive from achieving its expected performance during British Railways ownership.|$|E
5|$|Independent twin sets or {{independent}} doubles {{consists of two}} independent cylinders and two regulators, each with a submersible pressure gauge. This system is heavier, more expensive to buy and maintain and more expensive to fill than a single cylinder set. The diver must swap demand valves during the dive to preserve a sufficient reserve of gas in each cylinder. If this is not done, then if a cylinder should fail the diver may end up having an inadequate reserve. Independent twin sets do not work well with air-integrated computers as they usually only monitor one cylinder. The complexity of switching regulators periodically to ensure both cylinders are evenly used may be offset by the redundancy of two entirely separate breathing gas supplies. <b>The</b> <b>cylinders</b> may be mounted as a twin set on the diver's back, or alternatively can be carried in a sidemount configuration where penetration of wrecks or caves requires it, and where the cylinder valves are in easy reach.|$|E
5|$|Maunsell's Chief Locomotive Draughtsman, James Clayton, brought {{functional}} Midland Railway influences to the design, such as {{the shape}} of the cab and the drumhead-type smokebox, which sat on a saddle that was of wider diameter than the fully lagged and clad boiler. Clayton was also responsible for the tender and chimney designs. Snifting valves were provided to prevent vacuum formation in <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> when the locomotive was stationary, and the outside Walschaerts valve gear incorporated single slide-bars and piston tail rods. Innovations added by Maunsell's team included steam-powered locomotive brakes, locating the boiler water top feed inside a dome-like cover with external clackboxes and water feed pipes mounted on either side, and a new type of superheater that segregated saturated and superheated steam. Maunsell also incorporated a screw reverser to control valve events, which was easier to maintain than the complex steam reverser configuration of previous SECR designs. All components were standardised for interchange with similar locomotive classes to ease maintenance and reduce production costs.|$|E

25|$|The two {{cylinders}} were labelled A and B, with A being 61cm {{high with}} {{a diameter of}} 32cm and B being 56cm with a diameter of 33cm. <b>The</b> <b>cylinders</b> were hollow with perforations in the centre for mounting.

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 The flow {{configurations}} {{around and}} the forces acting on a circular cylinder with its axis parallel to a nearby plane boundary and subjected to a uniform flow were investigated. The flow conditions, which were perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> axis and parallel to the plane boundary were investigated experimentally and theoretically. Flow visualization was achieved {{through the use of}} tiny air bubbles entrapted in the fluid to locate the stagnation point and point of separation of flow. Also, the configuration of <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> wake was observed. A force measuring device employing the use of straingauges was used to record the change in lift and drag as <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> neared <b>the</b> plane boundary.

In addition, as <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> approached <b>the</b> plane boundary, the top separation point of <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> boundary layer moved towards the front of <b>the</b> <b>cylinder,</b> <b>the</b> bottom separation point moved towards the rear of <b>the</b> <b>cylinder,</b> and <b>the</b> front stagnation point moved downward.
