5|$|The {{music video}} sees Little Mix {{adopting}} a new heavier look including leather outfits, bullet chains and gothic makeup, and explores themes of jealousy and obsession. It features the group hunting down {{men who have}} wronged them. Filmed in comic book movie style, Little Mix play female assassins who stalk and then kidnap men they are obsessed with. In one scene, Perrie Edwards is angrily driving a car while next to a male passenger who is bound and gagged. Edwards sports glossy red lipstick and a biker jacket, keeping {{her eyes on the}} road and paying no mind to the camera as wind blows <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair.</b> Jade Thirlwall is seen stalking a man outside his bedroom window. Standing outside the window ledge, Thirlwall spies on a man who captured her heart. Thirlwall wears metallic silver and black striped highwaisted trousers, with a white shirt, black bow tie and braces. Jesy Nelson's scene {{is similar to that of}} Edwards. Nelson races to her destination in a vintage convertible with a lace visor covering her eyes as police sirens flash behind her. In another scene, Leigh-Anne Pinnock masterminds the story's plots in a secret room with a wall of evidence the group has compiled, of which includes maps and clippings.|$|E
500|$|According to Lady Gaga, {{the melody}} of [...] "Hair" [...] resembles {{the work of}} metal bands Kiss and Iron Maiden, and is also {{influenced}} by Bruce Springsteen. The song is an uptempo club record inspired by Gaga's experience as a teenager, when her parents forced her to dress in a certain way. Gaga found {{that the only way}} to express herself was <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair,</b> and she described it as a song about liberation and her ability to change her ways. The lyrics talk about embracing one's hairstyle as their ultimate expression of freedom. [...] "Hair" [...] was recorded while Gaga was on tour with The Monster Ball throughout Europe. The song features a saxophone solo performed by saxophonist Clarence Clemons, a prominent member of The E Street Band. She personally wanted Clemons to play saxophone on the song, which he did by recording his part at a Manhattan studio at midnight, after he had just flown there from his home in Florida.|$|E
500|$|The video {{opens with}} a bird's-eye view of Mumbai, with Azalea's name and [...] "Bounce" [...] in large yellow text. Scenes with local {{residents}} include a young Indian boy and children playing cricket. Azalea, in a gold bodysuit and Indian inspired clothing, slouches atop an Indian elephant. The song begins with Azalea and a troupe of female Indian dancers entering a darkened Bollywood set for a traditional Indian wedding. Azalea and the dancers, in traditional red saris with bindis, begin belly dancing and modernised Indian dance routines. The scene is intercut with snippets of Azalea walking and dancing in Mumbai's slums. On the Bollywood set, a large Indian family are seen celebrating, drinking and dancing. Azalea (in a green sari) dances in a garden, rides an elephant along city streets and travels in an auto rickshaw, wearing a printed silk blouse, with the wind blowing <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair.</b> Now in a blue sari, she lies on the elephant, gesturing with her hands and dancing next to Indian children on a cluttered platform.|$|E

500|$|In February 1992, Al Rendon {{was hired}} by EMI Latin to take {{photographs}} for Entre a Mi Mundo. A previous photographer had taken some photos of the singer, which were not well received by the company, and Rendon was asked to do a [...] "quick session". Rendon rented a studio and hired John MacBurney—whom Abraham constany argued with—to do the makeup. MacBurney [...] "privately complained" [...] to EMI Latin that Abraham was difficult to deal with. Rendon and MacBurney, however, found Selena [...] "real easy to work with". Selena picked out the outfit for herself to wear in the cover picture; this outfit included a black top with a mesh see-through midriff, a long-sleeve black jacket with black-and-white striped long sleeves, a wide black leather belt, and tight black pants. She chose a pose where she runs her fingers <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair,</b> a pose that Abraham was noticeably bothered with. In 1998, the outfit that she wore for the album cover was added to a museum that her family operates in Corpus Christi, Texas.|$|E
2500|$|The {{accompanying}} lyric {{video for}} [...] "Catch My Breath" [...] was premiered on VEVO on October 16, 2012. It {{marked the first}} time Clarkson released a lyric video to accompany a song. It featured the lyrics as several three-dimensional texts, being lit by glimmering lights, rotating around a promotional photo of Clarkson used in the single cover. The accompanying music video for [...] "Catch My Breath" [...] was directed by Danish director Nadia Marquard Otzen. It was filmed in London, immediately after the end of Clarkson's Stronger Tour. Unlike her previous videos which used a 4:3 and a 16:9 aspect ratio, it uses a [...] 2.39:1 anamorphic format. It premiered on November 12, 2012 on VEVO. The video begins with Clarkson standing in the water while the wind blows <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair,</b> representing tranquility. Throughout the video, different footage of splashing water, blazing fires and smoke in different colors, and water bubbles alternate with scenes of Clarkson performing the song. In the final chorus, smoke and fire flares up above Clarkson's head while she sings surrounded by water and air.|$|E
2500|$|Gomez {{revealed}} the artwork {{for the single}} on June 19, 2015. On it, she is seen striking a risqué pose, on a bar stool against a bare wall. The singer sports a natural look in the artwork; barefoot and wearing only an oversized, thin white T-shirt as she runs her hands <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair.</b> Jonathan Borge of InStyle opined that the cover art was enough to cause excitement on its own. Eric Diep from Complex said Gomez [...] "slays the cover artwork" [...] and felt it implied her upcoming album would substantiate her maturity as an artist. Idolator's Mike Wass opined that the artwork was a good look for Gomez which manifested maturity, and {{said that it was}} [...] "yet another indication that the next phase of her career will come as something of a shock to long-term fans". Laura Beck of Cosmopolitan called the cover art [...] "insanely sexy" [...] and [...] "gorgeous", and added: [...] "All this lady needs to look amazing is a T-shirt and a stool. Impressive". Wass, Corrine Heller of E! and Amanda Bell of MTV News all commended Gomez's sex appeal in the cover art, while other critics complimented the artwork's beauty and simplicity.|$|E

5000|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{marketing}} for the album centred on Iconiq's buzz cut hair-style, often marketed as [...] "baby short hair" [...] (ベビーショートヘア), along with the catch-phrase [...] "Watashi ga kawaru. Ongaku de kawaru." [...] (I change. I change <b>through</b> music.). <b>Her</b> <b>hair</b> style was suggested by her management as a strong image to compliment her desire for a theme of change.|$|R

5000|$|Mama D'Leau (derived {{from the}} French Maman de l'eau or [...] "Mother of the River"), {{also known as}} Mama Dlo and Mama Glo, is the {{protector}} and healer of all river animals, according to the folklore of Trinidad and Tobago. She is usually depicted as a beautiful woman with long, golden hair who sits on a rock at the river's edge. When angered, Mama D'Leau becomes serpent-like with each strand of <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> turning into a living snake. An armour of shining scales covers her upper body and arms and from her waist downwards twists into coils. Her tongue becomes forked and she holds a golden comb which she passes <b>through</b> <b>her</b> snaky <b>hair.</b>|$|R
60|$|The quiet tone of Siegmund {{moved her}} with a vivid passion of grief. She felt she should lose him. Clasping him very closely, she burst into {{uncontrollable}} sobbing. He did not understand, {{but he did not}} interrupt her. He merely held her very close, while he looked <b>through</b> <b>her</b> shaking <b>hair</b> at the motionless stars. He bent his head to hers, he sought her face with his lips, heavy with pity. She grew a little quieter. He felt his cheek all wet with her tears, and, between his cheek and hers, the ravelled roughness of <b>her</b> wet <b>hair</b> that chafed and made his face burn.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't know,' he replied. 'This is {{so bright}} we can't see beyond.' He {{turned his face}} to hers and through the {{darkness}} smiled into her eyes that were so close to his.

60|$|She {{released}} her fingers from his, drew out the hatpins from her hat, unwound the veil {{and threw them}} both on to the opposite seat.

60|$|Mrs. Peagrim {{wrinkled}} her fair forehead. It has been truly {{said that there}} is no agony like the agony of literary composition, and Mrs. Peagrim was having rather a bad time getting the requisite snap and ginger into her latest communication to the Press. She bit her lip, and would have passed her twitching fingers restlessly <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> but for the thought of the damage which such an action must do to her coiffure. Miss Frisby, her secretary, an anæmic and negative young woman, waited patiently, pad on knee, and tapped her teeth with her pencil.|$|E
60|$|Lady Franks {{started with}} a vivace Schumann piece. Everybody listened in sanctified silence, trying to seem to like it. When {{suddenly}} our Colonel began to spring and bounce in his chair, slinging his loose leg {{with a kind of}} rapture {{up and down in the}} air, and capering upon his posterior, doing a sitting-down jig to the Schumann vivace. Arthur, who had seated himself at the farthest extremity of the room, winked with wild bliss at Aaron. The Major tried to look as if he noticed nothing, and only succeeded in looking agonised. His wife studied the point of her silver shoe minutely, and peeped <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> at the performance. Aaron grimly chuckled, and loved the Colonel with real tenderness.|$|E

50|$|Twin {{sister of}} Izuna Endo, unlike her brother, Shizuna is very brash, loud and arrogant, often being the sending end of Koichi's abuse. Ironically, {{she is also}} one of the most comical characters, being used herself in {{extremely}} embarrassing ways. Also, she appears to be very dominating with her brother, though she deeply cares for him. She fulfills the role of piloting her twin-seat Machina, the massive Deceive. Also, she appears to have developed a crush on Koichi, though she never dares to admit it. Before being given a hairpin by Koichi, she could only be differentiated from <b>her</b> brother <b>through</b> <b>her</b> darker <b>hair</b> color and the fact that she speaks in Kansai dialect.|$|R
50|$|Karyn's fears prove well founded as she {{had indeed}} been tracked down {{by none other than}} her ex-husband Roy (now a {{werewolf}}) and Marcia Lura, the evil Drago werewolf who first bit him. Both Roy and Marcia survived the fire in Drago, but Marcia is now partially scarred and incapacitated due to being shot {{in the head with a}} silver bullet by Karyn at the end of the first novel. Though the bullet did not kill her as expected, it left a streak of silver <b>through</b> <b>her</b> black <b>hair</b> and rendered <b>her</b> unable to fully transform into a werewolf as before. Now, when the moon is full, she becomes a grotesque half-woman/half-wolf creature and wants revenge for what Karyn did to her.|$|R
6000|$|... "My love," [...] she said, {{her voice}} growing rapturous. And they kissed on the mouth, in rapture and surprise, long, real kisses. The kiss lasted, there among the moonlight. He kissed her again, and she kissed him. And again they were kissing together. Till {{something}} happened in him, he was strange. He wanted her. He wanted her exceedingly. She was something new. They stood there folded, {{suspended in the}} night. And his whole being quivered with surprise, as from a blow. He wanted her, {{and he wanted to}} tell her so. But the shock was too great to him. He had never realized before. He trembled with irritation and unusedness, {{he did not know what}} to do. He held her more gently, gently, much more gently. The conflict was gone by. And he was glad, and breathless, and almost in tears. But he knew he wanted her. Something fixed in him for ever. He was hers. And he was very glad and afraid. He did not know what to do, as they stood there in the open, moonlit field. He looked <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> at the moon, which seemed to swim liquid-bright.|$|E
6000|$|While Nedda sat, {{long past}} midnight, writing her heart {{out in her}} little, white, lilac-curtained room of the old house above the Spaniard's Road, Derek, of whom she wrote, was walking along the Malvern hills, hurrying upward in the darkness. The stars were his companions; though he was no poet, having rather the fervid temper of the born swordsman, that expresses itself in {{physical}} ecstasies. He had come straight out from a stormy midnight talk with Sheila. What was he doing--had been the burden of her cry--falling in love just at this moment when they wanted all their wits and all their time and strength for this struggle with the Mallorings? It was foolish, it was weak; and with a sweet, soft sort of girl who could be no use. Hotly he had answered: What business was it of hers? As if one fell in love when one wished! She didn't know--her blood didn't run fast enough! Sheila had retorted, [...] "I've more blood in my big toe than Nedda in all her body! A lot of use you'll be, with your heart mooning up in London!" [...] And crouched together {{on the end of}} her bed, gazing fixedly up at him <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair,</b> she had chanted mockingly: [...] "Here we go gathering wool and stars--wool and stars--wool and stars!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Dr. J. Crichton Browne {{has given}} me so {{striking}} an account of intense fear in an insane woman, aged thirty-five, that the description though painful {{ought not to be}} omitted. When a paroxysm seizes her, she screams out, [...] "This is hell!" [...] "There is a black woman!" [...] "I can't get out!"--and other such exclamations. When thus screaming, her movements are those of alternate tension and tremor. For one instant she clenches her hands, holds her arms out before her in a stiff semi-flexed position; then suddenly bends her body forwards, sways rapidly to and fro, draws her fingers <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair,</b> clutches at her neck, and tries to tear off her clothes. The sterno-cleido-mastoid muscles (which serve to bend the head on the chest) stand out prominently, as if swollen, and the skin in front of them is much wrinkled. Her hair, which is cut short {{at the back of her}} head, and is smooth when she is calm, now stands on end; that in front being dishevelled by the movements of her hands. The countenance expresses great mental agony. The skin is flushed over the face and neck, down to the clavicles, and the veins of the forehead and neck stand out like thick cords. The lower lip drops, and is somewhat everted. The mouth is kept half open, with the lower jaw projecting. The cheeks are hollow and deeply furrowed in curved lines running from the wings of the nostrils to the corners of the mouth. The nostrils themselves are raised and extended. The eyes are widely opened, and beneath them the skin appears swollen; the pupils are large. The forehead is wrinkled transversely in many folds, and at the inner extremities of the eyebrows it is strongly furrowed in diverging lines, produced by the powerful and persistent contraction of the corrugators.|$|E
