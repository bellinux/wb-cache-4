5|$|As Nixon {{prepared}} for the August 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, he discussed possible running mates with his staff. Among these were Ronald Reagan, the conservative Governor of California, and the more liberal Mayor of New York City, John Lindsay. Nixon felt that these high-profile names could split the party, and looked for a less divisive figure. He did not indicate a preferred choice, and Agnew's name was not raised at this stage. Agnew was intending {{to go to the}} convention with his Maryland delegation as a favorite son, uncommitted <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the main candidates.|$|E

5|$|During the Genêt episode, Washington, after {{consulting}} his Cabinet, issued a Proclamation of Neutrality on April 22, 1793. In it he declared the United States neutral {{in the conflict}} between Great Britain and France. He also threatened legal proceedings against any American providing assistance <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the warring countries. Washington eventually recognized that supporting either Great Britain or France was a false dichotomy. He would do neither, thereby shielding the fledgling U.S. from, in his view, unnecessary harm.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech {{had entered}} into {{the main part of}} its {{schedule}} after three dominating wins. Upcoming engagements with Vanderbilt, Pittsburgh, and Centre were said to determine the season's outcome. Pittsburgh and Centre–but Pittsburgh especially, were the biggest opponents. Vanderbilt was seen as the warm up act to these two, for it was far superior <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> Tech's prior games. The first game of the year to have direct implications for the Southern championship, it was cited by some as the most interesting southern contest of the week.|$|E

5|$|In January 2011, NuScale's largest investor, Kenwood Group, was {{investigated}} by the Securities Exchange Commission and later plead guilty to operating a Ponzi scheme.

5|$|In {{terms of}} any {{acknowledgement}} of the mutual existence between the scriptores, only Flavius Vopiscus (ostensibly writing in 305 or 306) refers <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the other authors (specifically Trebellius Pollio, Julius Capitolinus and Aelius Lampridius). None of the other five demonstrate any awareness {{of the existence of}} any of their 'colleagues'. However, these references cause difficulties when these authors also address Constantine in their dedications, as Vopiscus was also doing. For instance, Capitolinus mostly addresses Diocletian, but in the Albinus, Maximini and Gordiani he addresses Constantine in a fashion that suggests he is writing after 306.|$|E

To this day the southbound Northern line platform {{is the only one of}} the four deep level platforms that is not connected <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the others by deep level walkways.

5|$|Low {{challenged}} the Prime Minister over the Suez issue, {{accusing him of}} sending a threatening telegram that caused British Prime Minister Anthony Eden to back off the invasion and so gave the Soviets {{the opportunity for a}} military buildup in Egypt. St. Laurent angrily denied the charge and offered to open his correspondence <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the fifty privy councillors who could then announce whether St. Laurent was telling the truth. Low took St. Laurent up on his challenge, and selected the only living former Prime Minister, Tory Arthur Meighen, but the matter was not resolved before the election, and Meighen was not called upon to examine the correspondence in the election's aftermath.|$|E
