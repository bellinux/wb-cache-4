500|$|The {{acquittal}} of Thornton was {{met with}} outrage in Warwickshire, and indeed across the country. Newspapers published letters and comments which were extremely hostile toward Thornton. The leading papers in this campaign were the Lichfield Mercury and the Independent Whig, but even The Times expressed delight when it learned that the case would be further pursued. Funds were obtained from contributors, and a local solicitor prevailed on Mary's brother, William Ashford, <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> <b>appeal</b> of murder against Thornton. William Ashford was described as [...] "a plain country young man, about twenty-two years of age, of short stature, sandy hair, and blue eyes". A writ of appeal was issued on 1 October 1817, and Thornton was arrested on a warrant issued pursuant to that writ. As the appeal was to be tried before the King's Bench in London, Thornton was taken to London on 28 October. Supporters of the Ashford family {{did their best to}} find evidence to upset his alibi. They had little success. On 6 November, the case first came before the Court, but was quickly adjourned until the 17th when Reader indicated that he had just been instructed, and needed more time to advise his client as to his plea. The initial hearing was little attended, apparently because the public did not realise the notorious Thornton would be there in person.|$|E

5000|$|Section 69 permits {{an appeal}} {{on a point}} of law to a court unless the parties have agreed to exclude that right. [...] But the right <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> <b>appeal</b> may only be {{exercised}} either with the agreement of the other party, or with the leave of the court. An agreement by the parties to dispense with the requirement to give reasons for the tribunal's award is treated as an agreement to exclude the court's jurisdiction to hear an appeal on a point of law.|$|E
5000|$|Interlocutory appeals may be brought, however, {{if waiting}} <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> <b>appeal</b> would be {{particularly}} prejudicial {{to the rights}} of one of the parties. For example, if a party is asserting some form of [...] from suit, or is claiming that the court completely lacks personal jurisdiction over them, then it is recognized that being forced to wait for the conclusion of the trial would violate their right not to be subjected to a trial at all. Alternatively, the trial judge can [...] "certify" [...] one of his orders for immediate interlocutory appeal. Suppose all the claims and issues have been resolved as to one of the defendants, {{but the rest of the}} parties will be fighting out the case for another year or ten. The trial judge could [...] "certify" [...] (i.e. signal his agreement) to allow the part of the cases that is concluded at trial level to be appealed.|$|E

These courses are designed <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> individual the education they need, from a fundamental level, to in depth technical training in critical areas of digital signage. These certification programs are administered by an independent industry organization and advisory board, <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> clear educational message and industry recognition for professional achievement.|$|R
50|$|In most U.S. states, and in U.S. federal courts, parties {{before the}} court are allowed one appeal as of right. This means that a party who is {{unsatisfied}} with the outcome of <b>a</b> trial may <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> contest that outcome. However, appeals may be costly, and the appellate court must find an error {{on the part of}} the court below that justifies upsetting the verdict. Therefore, only a small proportion of trial court decisions result in appeals. Some appellate courts, particularly supreme courts, have the power of discretionary review, meaning that they can decide whether they will hear <b>an</b> <b>appeal</b> brought in <b>a</b> particular case.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{challenges}} the commonly held {{idea that the}} appeals process lowers the occurrence of legal errors. We show that, even if incorporating the right <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> <b>appeal</b> in criminal adjudication directly o¤ers the opportunity to correct mistakes made at trial, the 8 ̆ 5 nal impact on the appeals process on the accuracy of judicial decisions is ambiguous because of its e¤ect through trial court decision-makerse¤ort and crime deterrence. We 8 ̆ 5 nd out that according to (i) whether trial court decision-makers are rather reputation-concerned or socially-motivated, (ii) {{the distribution of the}} population of potential o¤enders and (iii) the marginal e¤ect of decision-makerse¤ort on the probability of wrongful conviction compared to wrongful acquittal, implementing an appeals process may spur decision-makers to reduce their e¤ort and thus be detrimental to the accuracy of legal decisions. We show that this result is true whether an appeal can be brought both after an acquittal or a conviction at trial, or the right <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> <b>appeal</b> is limited by double jeopardy...|$|E
