40|$|This thesis {{sought to}} {{determine}} if any differences in vocational identity (VI), {{as measured by the}} My Vocational Situation (MVS) (Holland et al., 1980) instrument, existed among transfer students entering the University of Kansas. This study measured VI of transfer students by several variables: academic classification, gender, age, ethnicity, credits earned, <b>transferring</b> <b>institution,</b> and number of times transferred. Lastly, this study developed local normative data for the transfer student population, and tested for differences between the local norms and the MVS sample norms. Data for this study was collected during a one-day orientation program attended by admitted transfer students. Responses from 253 completed surveys were used to test eight hypotheses. Statistical analyses revealed: a) female transfer students had higher VI mean scores than the MVS female college sample; b) female transfer students had higher Barriers (B) mean scores; and c) male transfer student had lower occupational information (OI) mean scores. The content of this study is important to understanding the transfer student and career development. Based on these findings, implications for practice and future research are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Technology {{transfer}} {{to developing countries}} {{has been identified as}} essential to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change. However, existing analyses underplay the influence of wider normative principles in shaping <b>institutions</b> for technology <b>transfer</b> in global climate governance. This article uses discourse analysis to explore the ideas and assumptions underlying technology <b>transfer</b> <b>institutions</b> both within and outside the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This discourse analysis identifies four key periods in the development of technology <b>transfer</b> <b>institutions</b> in global climate governance. In the first three periods, technology <b>transfer</b> <b>institutions</b> embody discourses ranging from green governmentality to deregulatory ecological modernization. In the fourth period, the post-Copenhagen Technology Mechanism embodies a broader discursive landscape that parallels a more fundamental contest over the extent to which redistributive claims are allowed to shape institutions of global climate governance...|$|R

40|$|We examine an {{overlapping}} generations {{economy with}} no pre-existing intergenerational transfers {{and study the}} set of <b>transfer</b> <b>institutions</b> {{in the core of}} the economy, that is, institutions that would be admissible for the first generation to create and would not be rejected by any future generation. Institution-building is assumed to be costly. We allow the cost of creating a new institution to vary with the size of the transfer it institutes and show that all institutions in the core must cost as much to build as they transfer. In fact, the core set is nonempty if and only if the institution that supports the golden-rule transfer costs as much to create as it transfers. The core set is characterized for various cost functions. We conclude that costs associated with the creation of <b>transfer</b> <b>institutions</b> are essential to make intergenerational transfers socially viable, but they may induce the choice of <b>institutions</b> making suboptimal <b>transfers.</b> Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the central}} roles for the {{community}} college {{is to provide a}} low cost, accessible education for students working toward a bachelor's degree. Their success in fulfilling this mission is a subject of some debate. (See Dougherty, 1994 and Pascarella, 1999 for a review of this issue.) Vital to this debate, however, is the ability to accurately measure the rate of transfer from 2 -year to 4 -year colleges. The current study uses a relatively new national database from the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) that will assist in this process. Transfer may be viewed {{from the perspective of a}} single college, a single state or the national as a whole. Much of the research on the transfer question comes from single institution studies. These studies often rely on student surveys or, occasionally, on the records of selected 4 -year <b>transfer</b> <b>institutions.</b> (As examples, see Conklin, 1995; Glass & Bunn, 1998; Broome, 2000.) The surveys used in these studies usually have low response rates and are not based on actual registration data at the <b>transfer</b> <b>institution.</b> As such, they do not provide a very reliable record of transfer and rarely track more than a handful of students moving across state borders. Nevertheless, these studies do provide som...|$|R

By completing NVC's core curriculum, students are allowed to transfer to any public institution in Texas without the worry of loss of credit in the transfer process.

40|$|The {{present study}} is an {{empirical}} investigation {{of the experience of}} students transferring from one post-secondary institution to another. Positioned within several theories, most notably emerging adulthood theory, the findings imply that transferring schools represents a positive growth experience for the student who recognizes an inappropriate match with the first institution attended. In telephone interviews, students who had transferred to a large, ethnically diverse, commuter university were asked about their perceived adjustment pre- and post-transfer, their perceived control over the transfer decision, and their transfer experiences. The results indicate that transfer students are engaging in a mature decision-making process. Transfer students perceived a better fit and improved adjustment at their new university, suggesting that <b>transferring</b> <b>institutions</b> was a beneficial decision...|$|R

This concept is applied to seaports, where so far, path dependence and lock-in have not been studied in detail.

In this process new layers are added to existing arrangements, gradually leading to a formalised governance reform but without breaking out of the existing path of development...|$|R
