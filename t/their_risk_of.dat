5|$|In 2011, the American College of Physicians (ACP) {{issued a}} {{clinical}} practice guideline making three strong recommendations based on moderate-quality evidence: that hospitalized patients be assessed for <b>their</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> thromboembolism and bleeding before prophylaxis is started; that heparin or a related drug be used if potential benefits {{are thought to}} outweigh potential harms; and that graduated compression stockings not be used. The ACP also drew attention {{to a lack of}} support for any performance measures encouraging physicians to apply universal prophylaxis without regard to the risks.|$|E
5|$|The Hawaiian {{monk seal}} {{has the lowest}} level of genetic {{variability}} among the 18 pinniped species, allegedly due to a population bottleneck caused by intense hunting in the 19th century. This limited genetic variability reduces the species's ability to adapt to environmental pressures and limits natural selection thus increasing <b>their</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> extinction. Given the monk seal's small population, the effects of disease could be disastrous.|$|E
5|$|Wildebeest {{can also}} {{listen in on}} the alarm calls of other species, and by doing so can reduce <b>their</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> predation. One study showed, along with other ungulates, wildebeests responded more {{strongly}} to the baboon alarm calls compared to the baboon contest calls, though both types of calls had similar patterns, amplitudes, and durations. The alarm calls were a response of the baboons to lions, and the contest calls were recorded when a dispute between two males occurred.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to several}} {{successful}} {{television and radio}} campaigns by the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations in Malawi, levels of awareness regarding HIV/AIDS are high among the general population. However, many men have adopted fatalistic attitudes {{in response to the}} epidemic, convincing themselves that death from AIDS is inevitable; on the other hand, some have implemented preventative techniques such as partner selection to try to reduce <b>their</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> infection. Although many women have developed strategies to protect themselves from HIV, {{women are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men in Malawi. The epidemic has affected sexual relationships between partners, who must cooperate to protect themselves from the disease. In addition, many teachers exclude HIV/AIDS from their curricula because they are uncomfortable discussing the topic or because they do not feel knowledgeable about the issue, and, therefore, many children are not exposed to information about HIV/AIDS at school. Finally, the epidemic has produced significant numbers of orphans in Malawi, leaving children vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.|$|E
5|$|Most {{forms of}} {{camouflage}} are ineffective when the camouflaged animal or object moves, because the motion is easily {{seen by the}} observing predator, prey or enemy. However, insects such as hoverflies and dragonflies use motion camouflage: the hoverflies to approach possible mates, and the dragonflies to approach rivals when defending territories. Motion camouflage is achieved by moving so as to stay on a straight line between the target and a fixed point in the landscape; the pursuer thus appears not to move, but only to loom larger in the target's field of vision. The same technique {{can be used for}} military purposes, for example by missiles to minimise <b>their</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> detection by the enemy. However, missile engineers, and animals such as bats, use the technique primarily for its efficiency rather than camouflage.|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} Kerala is {{often viewed as}} the ideal {{progressive}} leader in the women’s rights movement in India among states. Kerala maintains very high relative levels of female literacy and women’s health, as well as greater female inheritance and property rights. For example, a 1998 study conducted by Bina Agarwal found that while only 13% of all women in India with landowning fathers inherited that land as daughters, 24% of such women {{were able to do}} so in the state of Kerala. This is important because it has been shown that measures to improve such access to property and economic independence through channels such as education not only directly improve women’s wellbeing and capabilities, but also reduce <b>their</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> exposure to marital or any sort of domestic violence.|$|E

5|$|Genetic {{disorders}} {{can also}} cause endometrial cancer. Overall, hereditary causes contribute to 2–10% of endometrial cancer cases. Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that mainly causes colorectal cancer, also causes endometrial cancer, especially before menopause. Women with Lynch syndrome have a 40–60%risk of developing endometrial cancer, higher than <b>their</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> developing colorectal (bowel) or ovarian cancer. Ovarian and endometrial cancer develop simultaneously in 20% of people. Endometrial cancer nearly always develops before colon cancer, on average, 11years before. Carcinogenesis in Lynch syndrome comes from a mutation in MLH1 and/or MLH2: genes that participate {{in the process of}} mismatch repair, which allows a cell to correct mistakes in the DNA. Other genes mutated in Lynch syndrome include MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, which are also mismatch repair genes. Women with Lynch syndrome represent 2–3% of endometrial cancer cases; some sources place this as high as 5%. Depending on the gene mutation, women with Lynch syndrome have different risks of endometrial cancer. With MLH1 mutations, the risk is 54%; with MSH2, 21%; and with MSH6, 16%.|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} {{exists for}} aquatic nuisance species (ANS) to spread to uninfested waters through {{the transport of}} wild harvested baitfish and aquacultured fish. Baitfish and aquaculture industries are, however, diverse and complex, as are <b>their</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> spreading ANS. Most industry segments pose no or very low <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> spreading ANS. To deal effectively and fairly with this potential vector, {{it is important to}} characterize the industry according to <b>their</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> spreading ANS. Without adequate <b>risk</b> assessment <b>of</b> individual operations, regulations could be imposed which would unnecessarily negatively impact the economy of these industries and still not effectively reduce the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> spreading ANS. One approach to this problem is to apply the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) concept similar to that used by the seafood industry to minimize seafood consumption health <b>risks.</b> The advantages <b>of</b> this system are that it can effectively deal with a diverse industry, it {{has proven to be a}} good partnership between industry and government regulators, and, if properly applied, it is effective. The HACCP approach concentrates on the points in the process that are critical to the safety of the product, minimizes risks, and stresses communication between regulators and the industry...|$|R

Persistence in completing weight-loss programs were related to high RD scores during pre-treatment.

After the Chernobyl accident, only 0.1% of the 110,000 cleanup workers surveyed have so far developed leukemia, although not all cases resulted from the accident Estimated effective doses from the accident outside Japan are considered to be below (or far below) the dose levels regarded as very small by the international radiological protection community.|$|E
25|$|People {{tend to be}} more optimistically biased {{when they}} believe they have more control over events than others. For example, {{people are more likely to}} think that they will not be harmed in a car {{accident}} if they are driving the vehicle. Another example is that if someone believes that they have a lot of control over becoming infected with HIV, they are more likely to view <b>their</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> contracting the disease to be low. Studies have suggested that the greater perceived control someone has, the greater their optimistic bias. Stemming from this, control is a stronger factor when it comes to personal risk assessments, but not when assessing others.|$|E
