5|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> for men {{who oppose}} Senator McCarthy's methods to keep silent, or for those who approve. We can deny our {{heritage}} and our history, but we cannot escape responsibility for the result. There is no way for a citizen of a republic to abdicate his responsibilities. As a nation we have come into our full inheritance at a tender age. We proclaim ourselves, as indeed we are, the defenders of freedom, wherever it continues {{to exist in the}} world, but we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home.|$|E
25|$|We want {{every man}} and woman in these two {{counties}} to recall the dates of these murders and also to recall whether or not any person close to them was missing or out of pocket during those nights. Persons who have such information and have been withholding it when they know they should report it are leaving themselves open to possible charges of complicity in event the slayer is captured. Make no mistake {{about the fact that}} the slayer will be captured because we will not give up this hunt until he has been captured or killed. All information received will be treated confidentially. We urge you to come in and tell what you know. Don't be hesitant or fear that you are causing an innocent man embarrassment and trouble in as much all investigation will be confidential. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to take any chance on information which might lead us to the slayer. This maniac must be captured. We believe that we are justified in going to any ends to halt this chain of murder. Bear in mind--this killer may strike at any one. He may strike at persons close to him. For that reason, we believe any person with information that may lead us to the murderer should act in the interest of self-preservation.|$|E
2500|$|National police {{commissioner}} Mangwashi Victoria Phiyega, a former {{social worker who}} was appointed on 13 June, stated police had acted in self-defense, saying, [...] "This {{is no time for}} blaming, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> for finger-pointing. It is a time for us to mourn." [...] Phiyega presented aerial photography of the events which she claimed demonstrated that the strikers had advanced on the 500 strong police force before they had opened fire.|$|E
60|$|I made {{a gesture}} {{signifying}} that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> for sharp words.|$|R
60|$|The girl {{remembered that}} her father thought she didn't, but <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> for criticism, and she again nodded.|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> {{to explain}} so {{delicate}} a matter. I caught up my hat, and vanished {{out of the}} house.|$|R
2500|$|Rudy Giuliani, former Mayor of New York City, New York. Giuliani {{questioned}} Obama's {{judgment and}} overall experience. He said, [...] "John [...] has been tested. Barack Obama has not. Tough times require strong leadership, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> for on-the-job training." [...] He {{also said that}} Obama and Democrats [...] "are {{in a state of}} denial" [...] about the threat of terrorism to the U.S., while McCain can confront and defeat [...] "anything that terrorists do to us". He further said that Obama is without a record of leadership: [...] "He's the least-experienced candidate for President of the United States in at least the last 100 years." [...] The former Mayor praised Palin as [...] "one of the most successful governors in America—and the most popular... She already has more executive experience than the entire Democratic ticket." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Awake!" [...] she cried. [...] "Awake! <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> for sleep! Seleucus hath {{surrendered}} Pelusium to Cæsar, who marches {{straight on}} Alexandria!" ...|$|E
6000|$|McFarlane was staggered, but he answered: [...] "You can {{at least}} stay {{on the ground and}} help fight. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to stampede." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{interrupted}} Peter almost brusquely, {{with the}} sudden conviction that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> for revelation of his secret, [...] "no, nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} we should find one there," [...] {{said one of the}} wags of the hunt. Fowler shook his head, feeling that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> for joking.|$|R
60|$|Davies' start {{indicated}} that the shot, made at a venture, had reached its mark. He grew angry, but he quickly saw that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to lose his temper.|$|R
6000|$|But the Cardinal, {{impatient}} of interruption, spoke imperiously, [...] "What dost thou here, Merriman? Away, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> for thy fooleries and frolics." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I am Lady Bothwell; {{allow me}} to say that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> or place for long explanations. What are your {{commands}} with me?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nay, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> for quips and cranks,' I {{answered}} gravely; 'the {{chances are}} that few of us will ever see to-morrow's sun rise.' ...|$|E
60|$|Sight of Steele's bloody breast {{remained}} with me, and I had something sinister to combat. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> {{for me to}} reveal myself or to show unusual feeling or interest for Steele.|$|R
60|$|I {{did as she}} bid. Then I {{turned toward}} the distasteful work that lay before me. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> for fine compunctions, nor for a chivalry that these cruel demons would neither {{appreciate}} nor reciprocate.|$|R
60|$|Business, however, <b>was</b> business. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> {{to stand}} admiring artistic effects in room-furnishing. There was that big J to be carved {{on the front}} door. If 'twere done, then 'twere well 'twere done quickly.|$|R
6000|$|... "You have {{coloured}} {{his cheek}} in good earnest," [...] said the Captal de Buch. [...] "Consider, Chandos, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to damp his spirit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope that}} others may not repent this obstinacy! But <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to bandy words; {{the duty of}} the ship {{requires}} my presence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My writing!" [...] exclaimed Mrs. Easterfield. [...] "Now don't trifle! <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to {{make fun}} of me. Olive may be {{accepting}} him this minute." ...|$|E
60|$|Clayton {{noticed that}} she did not return his {{familiar}} salutation, but he felt no misgivings on that score. She had been through so much. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to force his love upon her, he quickly realized.|$|R
60|$|All <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{repeated}} by Lady Tringle to Mrs. Traffick, and by Mrs. Traffick to Gertrude. Then {{they felt}} that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> for Captain Batsby to produce himself to Sir Thomas as a suitor for his youngest daughter.|$|R
6000|$|James {{could not}} look at him without a {{conviction}} {{that he would never}} recover the use of his hand and foot; but <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to discourage his spirits, and the answer was--'My sister's natural home would be with me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hi! yi!' {{said the}} Subadar-Major, who was {{sweating}} profusely. 'Dam fools yonder, stand close-order! <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> for close-order, {{it is the}} time for volleys. Ugh!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tush, tush, sweet friend, I am {{a broken}} reed, but still I am free. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> for courtly phrases. Let's go, and go at once.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{has done}} well. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> for rash exposure, {{and where there}} is naught to be gained, it is a grave fault to run risks." ...|$|E
60|$|Maud drew back, {{her heart}} beat violently, her {{breathing}} became difficult, {{and the blood}} rushed to her temples. But an earnest motion from Nick reminded her <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> for hesitation, and she applied her mouth to the hole.|$|R
6000|$|... "What; {{at such a}} time as this; {{with these}} dreadful accusations running in her ears? Surely <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> for marrying! And what has come of it? People now say that he has {{rejected}} her and sent her away." ...|$|R
50|$|The Enemy Strikes! {{is a short}} {{propaganda}} film made in 1945 {{about the}} Battle of the Bulge. Its main emphasis is that, despite recent Allied victories, the Axis could still launch a counter-attack and that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to get complacent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tut! tut!" [...] cried Sherlock Holmes. [...] "You must act, man, {{or you are}} lost. Nothing but energy {{can save}} you. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> for despair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{had better}} not. You have been abominably treated; but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> for collisions. You agree with me, Phoebe; his absence {{would be the}} wisest course.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> for sleeping. Baloo knows it; I know it; the Pack know it; {{and even}} the foolish, foolish deer know. Tabaqui has told thee, too.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to ask questions, and Neal obeyed at once, observing as {{he entered}} the cabin that the {{stewards}} were collecting food and such other things as might be needed in case they were forced to depend upon the frail crafts.|$|R
60|$|On a {{handkerchief}} {{which was still}} sticking into the belt of her dress, I could see letters embroidered. Realizing that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> for hesitation, and that the girl's life might depend on my reading her name, I plucked it forth. It was Edith Croyden.|$|R
6000|$|... (I {{had to put}} it {{that way}} because Scandinavian grammar is not a strong point with me, and my {{knowledge}} of the verbs is as yet limited to the present tense of the infinitive mood. Besides, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to worry about grace of style.) ...|$|R
