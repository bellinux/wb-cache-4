25|$|In May 2014, over 40 {{bicycles}} {{were stolen}} from Baltimore Recreation and Parks department's bike-share program. <b>The</b> <b>bikes</b> were stolen during the city's Ride Around Reservoir program in Druid Hill Park. <b>The</b> <b>bikes</b> were set up to be lent out {{when a group of}} youths took them. The cost of replacing the stolen bikes is devastating to the program, which operates completely on donations.|$|E

5000|$|One of OCC's {{most popular}} <b>bikes</b> is <b>The</b> Fire <b>Bike,</b> which was {{designed}} by Paul Teutul Jr., to commemorate the New York firefighters {{who lost their lives}} on 9/11. <b>The</b> <b>bike</b> itself has been modeled after a fire truck, and an actual steel rivet from the World Trade Center has been integrated into <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> itself, mounted atop <b>the</b> <b>bike's</b> gas tank. Paul Jr. stated that <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> was named [...] "343", the number of New York firefighters who gave their lives on 9/11.|$|R

50|$|Phil {{decides to}} buy Luke {{a brand new}} green bike after Jay (Ed O'Neill) ridicules Luke for riding a girl's bike and tells him that he is {{responsible}} for it. When Phil comes across a bike that is similar to Luke's new bike, he immediately assumes Luke left <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> unlocked. Phil jumps on <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> to take it home, feeling that Claire will be upset with him for not listening to her. On his way home, he comes across Desiree and sets <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> down in order to help her get into her home - she had locked herself out. When returning to leave, <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> has disappeared. Phil visits <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> store to buy a replacement but when he gets home and confronts Luke, he learns that Luke never left <b>the</b> <b>bike.</b> When trying to take <b>the</b> replacement <b>bike</b> to <b>the</b> store, he is confronted by Claire who says he should not be sneaky and she forgives him - only to have Desiree show up with <b>the</b> second <b>bike,</b> saying her neighbor had placed it in her garage while Phil was in her bedroom. Phil eventually places one of <b>the</b> replacement <b>bikes</b> back in <b>the</b> spot from where he had stolen <b>the</b> second <b>bike</b> and he is confronted by a pair of kids who claim <b>the</b> <b>bike.</b>|$|R
25|$|Denzil Armour lit it, and Sam Brown did second unit, whilst Mark Adcock shot Bolex {{enabling}} {{me to get}} {{coverage of}} the six sets and choreography in one day.

25|$|In 1993, BMW {{introduced}} GS models {{powered by}} a single cylinder 4-valve 652cc Rotax engine, {{also known as a}} thumper, and chain drive. The off road-capable F650 Funduro had a 19inch front wheel, long travel suspension, bash plate, and a high seat. The more road biased F650ST Strada had a smaller diameter 18inch front wheel, narrower handlebars and smaller screen. <b>The</b> <b>bikes</b> were manufactured alongside the virtually identical 5-valve Aprilia Pegaso.|$|E
25|$|Under the Mongol Empire the khans such as Batu, Duwa, Kebek and Tokhta kept a whole {{college of}} male shamans. Those shamans {{were divided into}} bikes and others. <b>The</b> <b>bikes</b> (not {{confused}} with princess) were camped {{in front of the}} Great Khan's palace while some shamans left behind it. In spite of astrological observations and regular calendar ceremonies, Mongol shamans led armies and performed weather magic (lady in area).

50|$|Elaine strains {{her neck}} {{trying to get}} a <b>bike</b> down from <b>the</b> wall in a toy store. In pain, she impulsively claims that she would give up <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> to whoever fixes her neck. When Kramer gives her a {{treatment}} that makes her feel better, he demands <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> despite it being a girl's bike. Elaine reluctantly allows him to have it, but the next day, her neck pain soon returns worse than ever (Kramer said she should have slept on a board), so she demands <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> back. <b>The</b> pair decide to have a neutral third party, Newman, decide who should keep <b>the</b> <b>bike.</b> He declares that they should cut <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> in half, so Elaine and Kramer can both have it. Elaine thinks the idea is ridiculous but hesitantly agrees, whereas Kramer tells Newman to give <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> to Elaine, saying he would rather it belong to her than see it destroyed. Much to Elaine's outrage, this leads Newman to decree <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> should be Kramer's.|$|R
500|$|When braking is {{increasing}} {{the center of}} mass m may move forward relative to the front wheel, as the rider moves forward relative to <b>the</b> <b>bike,</b> and, if <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> has suspension on the front wheel, the front forks compress under load, changing <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> geometry. This all puts extra load on the front wheel.|$|R
25|$|Local {{transportation}} is primarily by bus or taxi. Anshan {{used to have}} a single tram line—along Zhonghua Avenue, through the city centre and past Angang main gate—but this has been closed and the tracks removed. Due to the flat topography of the city centre, bicycles are popular. Almost all roads have a wide cycle lane on each side. Often this lane is further protected by a traffic island that separates <b>the</b> <b>bikes</b> from larger motor vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Marlboro {{sponsors}} the Ducati Corse MotoGP {{team since}} 2003. Casey Stoner {{took his first}} MotoGP title in 2007. As of the 2009 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season they were only allowed to brand <b>the</b> <b>bikes</b> at one round, in Qatar, using the barcode in other races. The controversial barcode design was then removed by Ducati {{for the start of}} the French motorcycle Grand Prix in the 2010 season. In January 2011 the Ducati Team presented a new logo.|$|E
25|$|An in 2014 inaugurated bike sharing system covers {{mostly the}} Chengguan District with 377 stations. The system had a {{successful}} start {{and the number of}} stations is being expanded. However, vandalism proved to be a problem, with 600 (out of a total of 6,500) bikes a year not being returned to the stations. As bikes are not rented out anymore late at night, people reportedly outed their frustration on <b>the</b> <b>bikes</b> in the case they were too late to rent one.|$|E

2500|$|What was {{not shown}} on the {{programme}} was problems with <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> which required considerable attention, there were two filming false starts with <b>the</b> car and <b>bike</b> leaving simultaneously, but <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> breaking leading to a third attempt. <b>The</b> car and <b>bike</b> left some 40minutes after {{the departure of the}} steam train. After filming {{it was found that the}} problems with <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> were due to the film crew having changed the spark plug on the Vincent (without telling the technical support staff) to stop it interfering with the camera and sound equipment. (<b>The</b> <b>bike</b> had been checked pre-filming with the original plug and ran and started perfectly.) ...|$|R
25|$|E-bike sharing is {{becoming}} more popular. The e-bikes are generally recharged upon parking them at their station. E-bikes extend the range of <b>the</b> <b>bikes</b> and make cities with more difficult topographies more accessible to biking. In 2009, Chiyu Chen proposed the Hybrid2-system which stores some of the pedal power on a (ultra) capacitor. Similar to vehicle-to-grid systems, the energy is then fed {{back to the main}} electricity grid. The Ohio State University announced plans to integrate electric assist bicycles as part of its bicycle share program launching in 2015.|$|E

While Emma felt that Arjun's negotiations on this matter had been poor for not including her or Zoe, Nick questioned why Instinct had relinquished the candle lamps, when it {{had come from a}} brand name already being sold by one of the retailers.|$|E
25|$|In March 2017, Beijing saw over 200,000 dockless shared bikes {{from various}} {{companies}} entered service. Near {{the end of}} 2017 it has grown to 2.35 million for-hire bikes from 15 companies. <b>The</b> <b>bikes</b> are accessible via an app, and cost 1 RMB per hour plus a refundable damage deposit of 299 RMB. This {{is on top of}} the existing municipal run dock based bike network with 86,000 bikes. The Beijing municipal government has pledged to improve management and parking availability in response to the rapidly growing fleets of dockless bikes shares. Beijing cycling mode share increased from 5.5% to 11.6% after the arrival of these dockless bike systems.|$|E

25|$|Bicycles and {{tricycles}} {{are popular}} for getting {{around on the}} dry lake. Mountain bikes are generally preferred over road bikes for riding on the dried silt, which is normally hard but becomes loose with traffic. Participants often decorate their bikes to make them unique. Since lighting on <b>the</b> <b>bikes</b> is critically important for safety at night, many participants incorporate the lighting into their decorations, using electroluminescent wire (a thin, flexible tube that glows with a neon-like effect when energized with electricity) to create intricate patterns over {{the frame of the}} bike. Every night during Burning Man, thousands of bikes and art cars drive around, creating a visual display similar to Las Vegas at night, except that the lights are mobile.|$|E
25|$|Moto Guzzi was {{conceived}} by two aircraft pilots and their mechanic {{serving in the}} Corpo Aeronautico Militare (the Italian Air Corp, CAM) during World War I: Carlo Guzzi, Giovanni Ravelli and Giorgio Parodi. Assigned to the same Miraglia Squadron based outside Venice, the three became close, despite coming from different socio-economic backgrounds. The trio envisioned creating a motorcycle company after the war. Guzzi would engineer the motor bikes, Parodi (the son of wealthy Genovese ship-owners) would finance the venture, and Ravelli (already a famous pilot and motorcycle racer) would promote <b>the</b> <b>bikes</b> with his racing prowess. Guzzi and Parodi (along with Parodi's brother) formed Moto Guzzi in 1921. Ravelli, ironically, had died {{just days after the}} war's end in an aircraft crash and is commemorated by the eagle's wings that form the Moto Guzzi logo.|$|E
25|$|Little 500 {{bikes are}} rather distinctive. They are single gear, coaster brake racing bicycles. There are two {{different}} versions of the bike: the men's and the women's. The only difference between the men's and women's bikes is the frame size; the men race on a 56 cm frame, the women's bikes are built on 54 cm frames. Men and women race on the same 46x18 gearing. Every year {{a new version of the}} bike is made and then two are given to each team. The cost of <b>the</b> <b>bikes</b> are, for the most part, covered in the team registration fees and race sponsorship money. At the end of the season, team's are given the option to keep their bikes or to sell them back to IUSF. The used bikes are then kept at the track and are rented out by those teams that do not have old bikes.|$|E
50|$|The way {{in which}} <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> is locked to the {{structure}} is also important. It is important that a wheel and the frame of <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> is locked to a structure so that a thief cannot steal a wheel and leave <b>the</b> <b>bike,</b> or vice versa. A former London bike thief recommended small and stiff d-locks, as they are hardest to cut.|$|R
