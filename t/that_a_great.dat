5|$|Harper was an {{accomplished}} scholar (Semiticist) {{and a member}} of the Baptist clergy who believed <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> university should maintain the study of faith as a central focus, to prepare students for careers in teaching and research and ministers for service to the church and community. As per this commitment, he brought the University of Chicago's Seminary to Hyde Park which had remained continually in operation after the loss of the Bronzeville campus through the Baptist Theological Union in Morgan Park. This became the Divinity School in 1891, the first professional school at the University of Chicago.|$|E
5|$|While the {{governmental}} {{system in the}} central and western part of Switzerland, as described above, is well documented, nothing of substance {{is known about the}} political and administrative system in eastern Raetia. However, records of the time show <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> number of local nobles held political and religious offices in Raetia, indicating that the Romans successfully co-opted the local elite.|$|E
5|$|Among Western Europeans, {{there had}} long been rumors and {{expectations}} <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> Christian ally would come from the East. These rumors circulated {{as early as the}} First Crusade (1096–1099), and usually surged in popularity after the Crusaders lost a battle. A legend arose about a figure known as Prester John, who lived in far-off India, Central Asia, or perhaps even Ethiopia. This legend developed a life of its own, and some individuals who came from the East were greeted with expectations that they might be forces sent by the long-awaited Prester John. In 1210, news reached the West of the battles of the Mongol Kuchlug (d. 1218), leader of the largely Christian tribe of the Naimans. Kuchlug's forces had been battling the powerful Khwarezmian Empire, whose leader was the Muslim Muhammad II of Khwarezm. Rumors circulated in Europe that Kuchlug was the mythical Prester John, again battling the Muslims in the East.|$|E

5|$|As {{the fleet}} {{continued}} south from the Cape in early June, Burrough in the Roebuck took a Spanish flyboat {{after a long}} chase that brought him near the Spanish coast. The flyboat's master revealed <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> fleet was prepared at Cadiz and Sanlúcar de Barrameda. Having received intelligence that Raleigh was fitted out with a strong force for the West Indies, Philip II of Spain had provided a large fleet to oppose Raleigh and to escort the rich East India carracks to port. Don Alonso de Bazán, brother to the Marquis of Santa Cruz and Captain General of the Armada, was to pursue and intercept Raleigh's fleet. As Burrough's men were burning the flyboat, part of the Spanish fleet was spotted, and Burrough, having rejoined his own fleet, soon sailed to the Azores.|$|E
5|$|Being unemployed, {{we spent}} {{almost all of}} each weekday at the school, so if a tuition fee had been applicable, Mrs Mac would have earned a tidy sum of money. That, of course, was not her way of doing things. She {{required}} no payment for the training she provided, and I suspect that she was quite out of pocket over the whole affair... It would be true to say <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> number of the pilots whose futures were finally fulfilled in airlines in Australia owe a deal to Mrs Mac... There was no other school operating in Sydney at the time, providing Morse training to potential airline pilots, and no other school then or thereafter giving such training completely free of charge.|$|E
5|$|I {{remained}} on the wreck until she went down; the suction took me down some way, and a man got hold of my leg, but I managed to kick him off and came up and struck out for some pieces of wood {{that were on the}} water and started for land, about two miles off. I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F. Girardot, 43rd Light Infantry, to his father, 1 March 1852.|$|E

5|$|The Circus Starring Britney Spears {{generated}} {{positive to}} mixed reception from critics. While some praised its aesthetics and deemed {{it as an}} entertaining show, others criticized Spears' lack of involvement during some segments. The tour was a commercial success, with a total gross of $131.8million. This made The Circus Starring Britney Spears one of the highest-grossing tours of the decade. A great number of tickets were sold {{within a week of}} the tour's announcement, which prompted supporters to add more dates. The tour also broke attendance records in many cities and all the North American shows were sold out. It became the fifth highest grossing tour of 2009, and the sixth highest grossing tour ever by a female artist. The show generated controversy on the Australian leg after a reporter said <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> number of fans had walked out during the performances.|$|E

25|$|In {{common with}} other Restorationist churches, the LDS Church teaches <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>Great</b> Apostasy occurred.
