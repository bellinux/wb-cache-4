5|$|Animals {{and plants}} {{have evolved to}} {{synthesise}} {{a vast array of}} poisonous products including secondary metabolites, peptides and proteins that can act as inhibitors. Natural toxins are usually small organic molecules and are so diverse that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> natural inhibitors for most metabolic processes. The metabolic processes targeted by natural poisons encompass more than enzymes in metabolic pathways and can also include the inhibition of receptor, channel and structural protein functions in a cell. For example, paclitaxel (taxol), an organic molecule found in the Pacific yew tree, binds tightly to tubulin dimers and inhibits their assembly into microtubules in the cytoskeleton.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{residential}} areas at Chakokot possess {{one or more}} bottle-shaped underground storage chambers, known as chultunob, with 14 having been found as of 2001. Because of the thick vegetation at the site, investigators consider that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> more to be found. These chultunob were closed with disc-shaped stone lids, {{many of which were}} found either still in place or close to the aperture of the chultun to which it belonged. The stone lids were without perforations so it is supposed that the chambers were used to store dry goods rather than water.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way is a barred {{spiral galaxy}} with a {{diameter}} between 100,000 and 180,000 light-years. The Milky Way is estimated to contain 100–400 billion stars. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> at least 100 billion planets in the Milky Way. The Solar System is located within the disk, about 26,000 light-years from the Galactic Center, on the inner edge {{of one of the}} spiral-shaped concentrations of gas and dust called the Orion Arm. The stars in the inner ≈10,000 light-years form a bulge and one or more bars that radiate from the bulge. The very center is marked by an intense radio source, named Sagittarius A*, which {{is likely to be a}} supermassive black hole.|$|E

5|$|Blue whales were {{abundant}} {{in nearly all}} the oceans on Earth {{until the beginning of}} the twentieth century. For over a century, they were hunted almost to extinction by whalers until protected by the international community in 1966. A 2002 report estimated there were 5,000 to 12,000 blue whales worldwide, in at least five groups. The IUCN estimates that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> between 10,000 and 25,000 blue whales worldwide today. Before whaling, the largest population was in the Antarctic, numbering approximately 239,000 (range 202,000 to 311,000). There remain only much smaller (around 2,000) concentrations in each of the eastern North Pacific, Antarctic, and Indian Ocean groups. There are two more groups in the North Atlantic, and at least two in the Southern Hemisphere. As of 2014, the Eastern North Pacific blue whale population had rebounded to nearly its pre-hunting population.|$|E
5|$|Conventional {{sequencing}} {{begins with}} a culture of identical cells {{as a source of}} DNA. However, early metagenomic studies revealed that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> large groups of microorganisms in many environments that cannot be cultured and thus cannot be sequenced. These early studies focused on 16S ribosomal RNA sequences which are relatively short, often conserved within a species, and generally different between species. Many 16S rRNA sequences have been found which do not belong to any known cultured species, indicating that there are numerous non-isolated organisms. These surveys of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes taken directly from the environment revealed that cultivation based methods find less than 1% of the bacterial and archaeal species in a sample. Much of the interest in metagenomics comes from these discoveries that showed {{that the vast majority of}} microorganisms had previously gone unnoticed.|$|E
5|$|Triadic pyramids first {{appeared}} in the Preclassic. They consisted of a dominant structure flanked by two smaller inward-facing buildings, all mounted upon a single basal platform. The largest known triadic pyramid was built at El Mirador in the Petén Basin; it covers an area six times as large as that covered by Temple IV, the largest pyramid at Tikal. The three superstructures all have stairways leading up from the central plaza on top of the basal platform. No securely established forerunners of Triadic Groups are known, but they may have developed from the eastern range building of E-Group complexes. The triadic form was the predominant architectural form in the Petén region during the Late Preclassic. Examples of triadic pyramids are known from as many as 88 archaeological sites. At Nakbe, there are at least a dozen examples of triadic complexes and the four largest structures in the city are triadic in nature. At El Mirador <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> as many as 36 triadic structures. Examples of the triadic form are even known from Dzibilchaltun in the far north of the Yucatán Peninsula, and Q'umarkaj in the Highlands of Guatemala. The triadic pyramid remained a popular architectural form for centuries after the first examples were built; it continued in use into the Classic Period, with later examples being found at Uaxactun, Caracol, Seibal, Nakum, Tikal and Palenque. The Q'umarkaj example {{is the only one that}} has been dated to the Postclassic Period. The triple-temple form of the triadic pyramid appears to be related to Maya mythology.|$|E

25|$|Recently, {{researchers}} reanalyzed {{this early}} whaling data, {{along with more}} recent, but much sparser, sighting data. They conclude that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> at least two stocks of right whales in the western and eastern North Pacific, {{but that it is}} still unclear whether the Okhotsk population is a separate stock.|$|E
25|$|Twenty-four stone hut circles {{have been}} officially {{recorded}} here, although <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> remains of more within the enclosure, {{which has an}} area of over 16,000 square metres (four acres). Many of these hut circles feature L-shaped porches. The doorways are paved with naturally flat stones, and all face both downhill {{and away from the}} prevailing wind.|$|E

25|$|Bookplates, {{of which}} <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> {{far more than}} a million extant {{examples}} worldwide, have become objects of collection. One of the first known English collectors was a Miss Maria Jenkins of Clifton, Bristol, who was active in the field during the second quarter of the 19th century. Her bookplates were later incorporated into the collection of Joseph Jackson Howard.|$|E
25|$|The present aisles {{were most}} likely demarcated in 1824 but may have been {{established}} as late as 1873. Originally there were galleries in both {{the north and west}} wings, but only the north remains. The balusters <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> original, and the gallery itself is largely colonial. The present brick floors are clearly not of colonial age {{as is the case with}} the raised platforms for the chancel and pulpit.|$|E

25|$|Invasive species {{originated}} from the Red Sea and {{introduced into the}} Mediterranean by the canal have become {{a major component of}} the Mediterranean ecosystem and have serious impacts on the ecology, endangering many local and endemic species. About 300 species from the Red Sea have been identified in the Mediterranean, and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> others yet unidentified. The Egyptian government's intent to enlarge the canal has raised concerns from marine biologists, fearing that this will worsen the invasion of Red Sea species.|$|E
25|$|The Northland tusked weta {{lives in}} tree holes, similar to tree weta. The Mercury Islands or Middle Island tusked weta was {{discovered}} in 1970. It is a ground-dwelling weta, entombing itself in shallow burrows during the day, and is critically endangered: a Department of Conservation breeding programme has established new colonies on other islands in the Mercury group. The Raukumara tusked weta {{was discovered in}} 1996, in the Raukumara Range near the Bay of Plenty. It has the unusual habit of diving into streams and hiding underwater {{for up to three}} minutes if threatened. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> other tusked weta species still to be discovered.|$|E
25|$|I {{must tell}} you that in Mauritania, freedom is total: freedom of thought, {{equality}} – of all men and women of Mauritania... in all cases, especially with this government, this is in the past. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> former relationships – slavery relationships and familial relationships from old days and of the older generations, maybe, or descendants who wish to continue to be in relationships with descendants of their old masters, for familial reasons, or out of affinity, and maybe also for economic interests. But (slavery) is something that is totally finished. All people are free in Mauritania and this phenomenon no longer exists. And I believe that I can tell you that no one profits from this commerce.|$|E

25|$|It is {{commonly}} {{said that the}} tune for Kol Nidre is missinai - unchanged since Moses climbed down from Mount Sinai - In the early 17th century, Rabbi Mordechai Jaffe of Prague, known as the Levush, mentioned that all cantors knew a set melody which was traditional for Kol Nidre. Jaffe was actually complaining that the widespread and solid adherence to this melody was hampering his efforts to introduce corrections into the lyrics. And yet <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> no two synagogues in which the melody is chanted note for note absolutely the same. So marked is the variation {{in the details of}} the melody that a critical examination of the variants shows an approach toward agreement in the essentials of the first strain only, with transformations of the greatest diversity in the remaining strains. These divergences, however, are not radical, and they are no more than are inherent in a composition not due to a single originator, but built up and elaborated by many in turn, and handed on by them in distinct lines of tradition, along all of which the rhapsodical method of the hazzanut has been followed.|$|E
500|$|Even without {{gravitational}} evidence, Mike Brown, the discoverer of Sedna, {{has argued}} that Sedna's 12,000-year orbit means that probability alone suggests that an Earth-sized object exists beyond Neptune. Sedna's orbit is so eccentric that it spends {{only a small fraction}} of its orbital period near the Sun, where it can be easily observed. This means that unless its discovery was a freak accident, there is probably a substantial population of objects roughly Sedna's diameter yet to be observed in its orbital region. Mike Brown noted that [...] "Sedna is about three-quarters the size of Pluto. If there are sixty objects three-quarters the size of Pluto [...] then <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> forty objects the size of Pluto...If there are forty objects the size of Pluto, then <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> ten that are twice the size of Pluto. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> three or four that are three times the size of Pluto, and the biggest of these objects... is probably the size of Mars or the size of the Earth." [...] However, he notes that, should such an object be found, even though it might approach Earth in size, it would still be a dwarf planet by the current definition, because it would not have cleared its neighbourhood sufficiently.|$|E
500|$|Beghe was a {{guest in}} May 2009 on the BBC World Service radio program , where he {{discussed}} his views on {{what he thought of}} Scientology when he first joined: [...] "I thought that it was something that was going to deliver miracles, and that it was the most selfless group of people that were totally dedicated to helping mankind, and I {{wanted to be part of}} it." [...] He was also critical of the Scientology organization leadership, including its head David Miscavige: [...] "I think that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> things of Scientology that are valuable and that can help people - my main issue is not with Scientology per se, it is with Scientology the organization - it is a corrupt I believe and probably a criminal endeavor, and that has to do with people who are in charge of Scientology mainly David Miscavige..." ...|$|E
