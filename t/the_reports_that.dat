5|$|By {{the end of}} September, Vikrant and her escorts reached Port Blair. En {{route to}} Visakhapatnam, {{tactical}} exercises were conducted {{in the presence of}} the Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Eastern Naval Command. From Vishakhapatnam, Vikrant set out for Madras for maintenance. Rear Admiral S. H. Sharma was appointed Flag Officer Commanding Eastern Fleet and arrived at Vishakhapatnam on 14 October. After receiving <b>the</b> <b>reports</b> <b>that</b> Pakistan might launch preemptive strikes, maintenance was stopped for another tactical exercise, which was completed during the night of 26–27 October at Vishakhapatnam. Vikrant then returned to Madras to resume maintenance. On 1 November, the Eastern Fleet was formally constituted, and on 13 November, all the ships set out for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. To avoid misadventures, it was planned to sail Vikrant to a remote anchorage, isolating it from combat. Simultaneously, deception signals would give the impression that Vikrant was operating somewhere between Madras and Vishakhapatnam.|$|E
5|$|Parsons {{testified to}} a closed federal court {{that the moral}} {{philosophy}} of Thelema was both anti-fascist and anti-communist, emphasizing his belief in individualism. This along with references from his scientific colleagues resulted in his security clearance being reinstated by the Industrial Employment Review Board, which ruled that there was insufficient evidence that he had ever had communist sympathies. This allowed Parsons to obtain a contract in designing and constructing a chemical plant for the Hughes Aircraft Company in Culver City. Von Kármán put Parsons in touch with Herbert T. Rosenfeld, President of the Southern Californian chapter of the American Technion Societya Zionist group dedicated to supporting the newly created State of Israel. Rosenfeld offered Parsons {{a job with the}} Israeli rocket program and hired him to produce technical reports for them. In November 1950, as the Red Scare intensified, Parsons decided to migrate to Israel to pursue Rosenfeld's offer, but a Hughes secretary whom Parsons had asked to type up a portfolio of technical documents reported him to the FBI. She accused Parsons of espionage and attempted theft of classified company documents on the basis of some of <b>the</b> <b>reports</b> <b>that</b> he had sought to submit to the Technion Society.|$|E

25|$|The {{paranoia}} {{that rose}} up around Hashimi's announcement and <b>the</b> <b>reports</b> <b>that</b> the buses were leaving Iraq slowed {{the influx of}} activists into Iraq, and caused some of those already there to leave Iraq, believing they had lost credibility through Hashimi's actions. The Iraqi authorities, on the other hand, saw Kenneth O'Keefe, Sloan, and other organisers as constantly challenging Hashimi's authority and being deliberately disruptive, and that some would-be shields were taking too long to deploy to sites.

25|$|During {{grand jury}} {{testimony}} in December 2003 – which was illegally leaked to the San Francisco Chronicle and published in December 2004 – Giambi allegedly admitted to using many different steroids, including fertility drugs (which could account for his declining health {{in the past few}} years). <b>The</b> <b>reports</b> <b>that</b> came from the San Francisco Chronicle were done by Mark Fainaru-Wada and Lance Williams, who revealed that the Bay Area Laboratory Cooperative did not merely manufacture nutritional supplements, but also distributed exotic steroids. Williams and Fairanu-Wada also provided compelling evidence that Bonds, arguably the greatest player of his generation, was one of BALCO's steroid clients. The paper reported that these substances were probably designer steroids. Bonds said that Greg Anderson gave him a rubbing balm and a liquid substance that at the time he did not believe them to be steroids and thought they were flaxseed oil and other health supplements. Based on the testimony from many of the athletes, Conte and Anderson accepted plea agreements from the government in 2005 on charges they distributed steroids and laundered money to avoid significant time in jail. Conte received a sentence of four months in jail, Anderson received a sentence of three months. Also that year, James Valente, the vice president of Balco, and Remi Korchemny, a track coach affiliated with BALCO, pleaded guilty to distributing banned substances and received probation.|$|E

500|$|Following {{a season}} which had seen Darren Berry and Shane Warne share the {{captaincy}} of Victoria's ING Cup side, the Victoria selectors appointed White as the captain for the 2003–04 season. [...] Aged only 20, White {{became the youngest}} player to captain the Victoria state side in its 152-year history to that point. [...] His coach, David Hookes said that [...] "White has shown {{at a young age}} a successful understanding of captaining a team". The decision was supported by <b>the</b> <b>reports</b> <b>that</b> during the Under-19 World Cup, he captained the side with [...] "flair, control and maturity far beyond his years". White was also called upon to captain the first-class side early in the 2003–04 season, after regular captain Berry broke his finger during a practice match. After a win and a loss while captaining the ING Cup side, White was named man of the match on his debut as Pura Cup captain, taking six wickets to lead Victoria to a five wicket victory over Queensland.|$|E
500|$|The British steel {{industry}} was protected from more efficient foreign competition by the government's high tariff wall. The BISF, through its control of pricing, could also present {{a united front}} against new competition at home. When the feasibility report was received by the BISF in March 1935 [...] the Federation's chairman, Sir Andrew Duncan, at first reacted positively; his members from the north-east were rather less enthusiastic. Only {{one of the large}} steel firms in the region, the Consett Iron Company, offered support for a Jarrow steelworks, while other BISF members put pressure on London's financial institutions to withhold capital from the new scheme. Reports of such tactics caused great anxiety in the Jarrow area, where the people were desperate for the new works to come about. In a reassuring speech shortly before the November 1935 general election, Baldwin, now leading the National Government, informed his listeners in Newcastle: [...] "There is no truth in any of <b>the</b> <b>reports</b> <b>that</b> either the banks or any other authorities... are making a dead set to prevent anything of the kind being done in the area".|$|E

500|$|Among the {{civilian}} fatalities during the mutiny were thirteen British men; one British woman, Mrs. G.B. Woolcombe (her death was later declared by the British authorities {{to have been}} accidental and unintended); two Chinese women; one Chinese man; and two Malay men. Based on available historical evidence, although the mutineers clearly directed their murderous intentions towards the British, they were careful to avoid targeting and the killing of British women [...] Unfortunately, {{the fact that only}} one British woman was killed was often ignored in <b>the</b> <b>reports</b> <b>that</b> followed the mutiny. For instance, in a long letter detailing her experience during the mutiny, a British woman who was an eyewitness to the incident misleadingly wrote in to The Times that the sepoys had [...] "deliberately shot at every European man or woman they saw" [...] and that [...] "21 English men and women were buried yesterday" [...] (26 March 1915). Sir Evelyn Ellis, a member of the Legislative Council in Singapore and of the official court of enquiry that investigated the mutiny, publicly described the revolt as [...] "part of a scheme for the murder of women and children". More than 15 years later, in 1932, a journalist in Penang, George Bilainkin, wrote that during the mutiny, the sepoys had [...] "knifed and shot white men and women indiscriminately". As recently as 1989, CM Turbull erroneously wrote that during the mutiny, the sepoys roaming the streets were ‘’killing any Europeans they encountered’’.|$|E
