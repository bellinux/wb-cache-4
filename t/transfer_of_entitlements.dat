40|$|In an {{important}} article, Calabresi and Melamed distinguish two different techniques for protecting legal entitlements. One {{they call a}} 2 ̆ 2 property 2 ̆ 2 rule {{and the other a}} 2 ̆ 2 liability 2 ̆ 2 rule. According to Calabresi and Melamed, a right or entitlement is protected by a property rule when it can be appropriated by a non-owner only if he first purchases permission to do so from the owner of the right. When a right is protected by a rule of this sort, one who appropriates it without the owner 2 ̆ 7 s permission will always be subject to a special sanction—typically, a fine or imprisonment. If a right is protected by a liability rule, in contrast, a non-owner who unilaterally appropriates it need only compensate the owner, after the taking, for any loss the owner suffers. The compensatory amount which a nonowner must pay for taking a right protected by a liability rule is set by a representative of the state rather than by the owner of the right in a voluntary transaction between owner and taker. Calabresi and Melamed attempt to explain why some legal entitlements are protected by a property rule and others by a liability rule. They suggest that in certain cases the cost of negotiating the voluntary transfer of a right may be sufficiently high to frustrate the transfer. Where this is so, a property rule, which is intended to encourage transfers of this sort, is likely to promote an inefficient allocation of resources. This point is illustrated by automobile accidents and pollution torts. In both cases, a voluntary <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>entitlements</b> is almost certain to be prohibitively expensive: {{in the case of an}} automobile accident because of the cost of identifying the victim beforehand, and in the case of pollution torts because of freerider and hold-out complications which are likely to make any negotiated settlement enormously difficult and time-consuming...|$|E

40|$|Most {{people do}} not hold those who {{intentionally}} flout property laws in particularly high regard. The overridingly negative view of the property lawbreaker as a 2 ̆ 2 wrongdoer 2 ̆ 2 comports with the status of property rights within our characteristically individualist, capitalist, political culture. This reflexively dim view of property lawbreakers is also shared, to a large degree, by property theorists, many of whom regard property rights as a relatively fixed constellation <b>of</b> <b>entitlements</b> that collectively produce stability and efficiency through an orderly system of ownership. In this Article, Professors Peihalver and Katyal seek partially to rehabilitate the reviled character of the intentional property lawbreaker, and to show how property outlaws have {{played an important role}} in the evolution and <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> property <b>entitlements.</b> The authors develop a typology of the property outlaw by distinguishing between 2 ̆ 2 acquisitive 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 expressive 2 ̆ 2 outlaws. They show that both types of property outlaw have enabled the reevaluation of and, at times, productive shifts in, the distribution or content <b>of</b> property <b>entitlements.</b> What emerges from this study is a vision of property law that looks beyond its capacity for fostering order and stability, focusing instead on its dynamic function as a site for the resolution of conflict between owners and nonowners. The authors argue that, if property is to perform this function, the law should be careful not to overdeter nonviolent refusals to abide by existing property arrangements...|$|R
40|$|Retrenchment of {{the public}} sector as a direct {{provider}} of rented accommodation has been accompanied by a growing reliance on housing associations as alternative providers of below-market rented accommodation in the UK. The most successful vehicle to date (in terms <b>of</b> <b>transferred</b> ownership <b>of</b> units) for growing the not-for-profit sector has been so-called ¿large-scale voluntary transfer¿ of dwellings formerly owned by local authorities. Since {{the turn of the century}} this has been accompanied by the rapid expansion of ¿arms-length management organizations¿ in England. Notably though, for a process concerned with the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>entitlements</b> to property, the literature on stock transfer and social housing reform is marked by a curious absence of any discussion of a property rights dimension of this process and, particularly, how degree and form of ownership is capitalized through the prevailing (and changing) governance structures. The point of departure for this article is an examination <b>of</b> how stock <b>transfer</b> separates ownership over social housing attributes and the relative valuation of property rights. We argue that stock transfer involves the de jure <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> property to a new legal entity, but that a significant part of de facto property rights remain ¿un-transferred¿, or have been redistributed within the public sector and thus do not necessarily constitute a redrawing {{of the public}} domain boundary...|$|R
40|$|The central allocative {{decision}} {{confronting a}} judge in a nuisance dispute should not concern the identity <b>of</b> the initial <b>entitlement</b> recipient but rather {{the identity of the}} more efficient chooserthe litigant who can more efficiently allocate the entitlement. We show that liability rules can produce four basic allocations which differ centrally in the ways in which courts delegate to litigants the authority to ultimately allocate the entitlement. Two classes concern "single chooser" rules that vest (in the absence of an agreement to the contrary) the allocative decision solely in one of the litigants. The other two classes concern a new type of rule, "dual chooser" rules, that allow either party to veto the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> an <b>entitlement.</b> Dualchooser rules are more than a theoretical curiosity both because they exist in our current law and because at times they produce systematically greater allocative efficiency than either type of single-chooser rule. Two heads are sometimes better than one. A central result of the paper is that in choosing among different liability rules allocative concerns can be decoupled from distributive concerns. There exist an infinite number of liability rules which produce each of the four basic allocations, but every rule within a particular class divides differently between the litigants the expected value of the allocation. To successfully decouple, courts should at times impose "call option," "put option," "Pay or be Paid," and "Pay or Pay" rules. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{body of work}} {{examines}} {{the concept of an}} inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement,</b> the modern term for a concept that {{can be traced back to}} Plato in 360 BCE (Before Christian Era). Although the concept is advanced and examined in philosophical terms, Plato’s work is also considered to be one of the first and most comprehensive psychological theories of human motivation. A sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> is frequently referred to in contemporary literature, and yet there has been a lack of investigations into the nature <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> and how it operates in violent men. This investigation set out to rectify the deficiency by examining the concept through four studies. The global purpose of this thesis is to determine if an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> is related to both violent offending and self-harming behaviour. The first study was designed to refine a definition of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> for violent offenders and to determine if there was a qualitative difference in this characteristic between violent offenders and male members of the general public. The study examined twelve domains used to describe an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement.</b> It also identified two main themes which were an action theme and an experiential theme. The action theme included actions that were likely to be elicited when an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> was violated. These actions were assault, confrontation and rejection of others. This was particularly so when the domains of anger, respect, power, obedience from subordinates and obedience from family and friends were violated. The experiential theme included emotions and cognition and whether these were expressed in an outward direction towards others or inwardly towards the self. The second study was conducted on archival material from a prison database. It examined the self-harming behaviour of offenders currently incarcerated in Western Australia (WA). This study was conducted to test the assumption that violent offenders are more likely to self-harm than non-violent offenders, using a current cohort. It was revealed that violent offenders self-harm at a far higher rate than incarcerated nonviolent offenders. Of the self-harming offenders, nine out of ten were violent offenders. It was also found that violent offenders were far less likely to have warnings of potential self-harm on the prison database than non-violent offenders. The third study involved the construction and validation of the Sense <b>of</b> <b>Entitlement</b> Questionnaire (SOEQ) on a student population. The purpose of this study was to enable the measurement of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> in violent men. The action themes and the domains from the first study formed the basis of the questions. This scale had sound psychometric properties and revealed two statistical factors indicating both attitude and behaviour subscales. Further investigations found differences in levels of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> in terms <b>of</b> age and sex. The fourth study was the administration of the SOEQ to violent and non-violent, as well as self-harming and non-self harming, incarcerated offenders. This was to establish the level of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> in violent men as well as to establish the level of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> in self-harming offenders. It was found that violent men have an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> in both attitude and behaviour. If their inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> was violated then violence was most likely their first choice. This was particularly likely when the respect, power, forgiveness and anger domains were involved. When examining self-harming behaviour and entitlement, this study found a difference in attitude only. This body of work demonstrated that an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> is related both to violent offending and self-harming behaviour. Through these investigations different aspects of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> were identified, which included a strong desire for respect, power, admiration and status, as well as a profound aversion to feelings of shame, disrespect and humiliation. A violation of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> has the capacity to end in violent behaviour towards others and harm towards the self. These findings show how an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> meets two <b>of</b> the three criteria required to qualify as a criminogenic need: that is, that the characteristic has the ability to distinguish non-criminal from criminal behaviour and has the ability to be measured. This opens the way for further research to investigate the third criterion required to qualify for a criminogenic need, which is whether an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> can be changed...|$|R

40|$|Background The {{current study}} {{investigated}} the role of three facets <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> (active, passive and revenge) in various forms of subjective well-being (SWB) : hedonistic and two facets of eudaimonic well-being (social and psychological). Social well-being was based on Keyes’ model (1998) and psychological well-being on Ryff’s model (1989). Participants and procedure The study was performed in three nations (Poland, Puerto Rico and Vietnam) on student samples (Poland, n = 245, Vietnam, n = 115, and Puerto Rico, n = 300). To assess entitlement level the Entitlement Questionnaire was used. The level of hedonistic well-being was measured with the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and eudaimonic well-being by the Mental Health Continuum–Short Form (MHC-SF). Results Active entitlement {{was positively related to}} all aspects <b>of</b> SWB. Revenge <b>entitlement</b> was negatively related to hedonistic and psychological SWB in all samples and negatively related to social well-being only in Poland. Passive entitlement was unrelated to SWB. Conclusions The current study shows cross-cultural similarities in relationships <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> with hedonistic and psychological well-being and cross-cultural differences in the relationship <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> with social well-being. Additionally, the study indicates positive meaning of healthy aspects <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> for subjective well-being and negative meaning of dysfunctional aspects <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> for subjective well-being...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study is to examine the {{possible}} relationship between socioeconomic status, the personality trait sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> and driver attitudes and behaviour. Previous research have shown that individuals high in sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> are less inclined to abide by the rules and norms that normally govern social interactions. They might be aware of what the rules are, but they see themselves as exempt from these rules due to their perceived special status. They also show increased levels of aggression in situations with perceived ego threat, and show less concern for the welfare of others. The same kinds of behaviour has also been associated with having a high socioeconomic position, and it could be that these variables are related. The results are based on the responses to a mail questionnaire survey carried out among a representative sample of the Norwegian public (n = 159). Sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> was found to predict attitudes towards violations and speeding, self-reported violations and aggressive behaviour in traffic, in addition to positive behaviour towards other road users. Unexpectedly, an inverse relationship between socioeconomic status and sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> was found. Income had a direct effect on attitudes and behaviour, and moderated the effect <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> on attitudes towards violations.
