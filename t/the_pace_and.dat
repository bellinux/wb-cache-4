5|$|After {{two years}} of poor {{attendance}} at ACC championship games in Tampa, Florida, organizers hoped moving the game to Charlotte, closer to the geographic center of the conference, would result in improved ticket sales. That hypothesis was borne out as early public sales approached 28,000 tickets before the participating teams were officially announced. After the announcement, each school sold its allotment of 10,000 tickets, and the more than 50,000 publicly available tickets were purchased at a rapid pace.

Talking about the anime's second half, {{he said that it}} drastically altered <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>and</b> content to the point that viewers might be put off with its conscious bending of the rules of handling characters and viewers alike—Meek was ultimately angry at the series' brutal ending, but it also left him eager to see its movie conclusion.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to England, Hirst completed another double in 1904. Although a leg injury reduced <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>and</b> effectiveness of his bowling {{for much of}} the season, he scored 2,501 runs at an average of 54.36, the highest aggregate and average of his career, and took 132 wickets at 21.09. He became the first Yorkshire player to achieve the double of 2,000 runs and 100 wickets, a feat previously achieved only by the Gloucestershire trio of W. G. Grace, Charlie Townsend and Gilbert Jessop. Most of his eight centuries were either against the strongest counties or in adverse circumstances for the team. In August, Hirst had a benefit match against Lancashire from which he received £3,703, worth around £296,000 in 2009, a very high sum for a benefit at the time, and his popularity was reflected in the attendance over three days of 78,792 spectators.|$|E

After Australia finished at 509 {{on the third day}} to take a 344-run lead, Miller opened the bowling with Johnston—Lindwall was injured while bowling in the first innings and was unable to take to the field. Miller removed Washbrook for one, caught behind by Tallon from a top-edged hook shot. Washbrook was displeased with the decision and gestured to a red mark on his shirt, indicating his opinion that the ball hit his clothing rather than the bat.|$|E

5|$|The match {{followed}} a familiar pattern of Arsenal dictating <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>and</b> creating chances, but failing to breach the Liverpool defence. Arsenal had a penalty appeal turned {{down in the}} first half, when defender Stéphane Henchoz handled the ball to deny Thierry Henry a goalscoring opportunity. Henchoz's partner Sami Hyypiä {{made a series of}} goalline clearances during the second half, but was helpless to stop Arsenal taking the lead in the 72nd minute. Liverpool responded by making changes and equalised in the 83rd minute; Arsenal's failure to deal with a free-kick presented Michael Owen the chance to score. Owen then outpaced Lee Dixon and Tony Adams to score his second and the match winner, two minutes before the end of normal time. Liverpool's victory marked the second part of their unique treble of the 2000–01 season: they had won the League Cup in late February and added the UEFA Cup four days later.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} possession, Harp changed Jayhawks' defense to a mantoman. The change in defense caused the Tar Heels {{to become more}} active on offense with several screens and movement on offense. The possession resulted in an off the ball foul that sent Rosenbluth to the free throw line where he made both shots. Kansas pushed the ball up the court quickly with King, who took an eight-foot shot and Carolina collected the rebound and continued to slow the tempo in the half court as Kansas shifted back into a 23 zone. The Tar Heels passed the ball back and forth until the Jayhawks broke from their zone and went into a mantoman again. Kearns made a close quarters shot in the paint. Kansas stepped up their defense {{at the behest of}} coach Harp and held Carolina scoreless for two minutes. During the period, Kansas made four free throws to cut their deficit to two points, with the score being 1917. The Tar Heels continued to slow <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>and</b> work the ball around to get the open shot, while the Jayhawks would rush up the court and attempt to give the ball to Chamberlain before taking a poor shot. This resulted in moderate success for both teams as North Carolina scored eight points to Kansas' three before the final two minutes began. In the closing two minutes, the two teams would both score two free throws to bring the score to 2922 in favor of North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Neuner {{went into}} her first Winter Olympics in Vancouver with the {{declared}} aim of winning a gold medal. On 13 February 2010, she participated in the opening sprint, which was contested at Whistler Olympic Park in rainy conditions. With one shooting error, Neuner claimed the silver medal, finishing 1.5seconds behind Slovakia's Anastasiya Kuzmina. She uncharacteristically lost five seconds against the unheralded Slovak on the cross-country course, which led to speculation of inferior ski preparation in the German media. Three days later, Neuner won gold in the subsequent pursuit race. Despite missing two targets in the standing position, she beat sprint winner Kuzmina by 12.3seconds. In her third Olympic event, she finished tenth in the individual. She had three shooting mistakes and said it had been {{difficult for her to}} immediately get her concentration back after winning her first gold medal. On 21 February 2010, Neuner claimed her second gold of the Games in the mass start. After missing two targets, she had been trailing by as much as 29seconds, but she pushed <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>and</b> a clean final standing shoot allowed her to overtake Russia's Olga Zaitseva on the last lap. After the race, Neuner made the announcement not to participate in the relay, citing mental exhaustion and her desire to give all of her team mates the chance to win a medal. Her withdrawal allowed her friend Martina Beck a start in her last Olympic Games. Neuner was Germany's most successful athlete in Vancouver and was chosen to carry the German flag at the closing ceremony.|$|E

The rest of his season was successful. Favoured by pitches made receptive to his bowling by rain, he recorded impressive performances, earning selection for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's Cricket Ground, where he took five wickets in the Gentlemen's first innings. He was also selected in the less prestigious Gentlemen v Players fixtures at The Oval and Scarborough and was awarded his county cap by Yorkshire. Having been watched by England selectors, and after taking 11 wickets for Yorkshire in their match against the touring New Zealand team, Verity was selected {{in the final two}} Test matches of the series between England and the tourists. The first match was drawn after the New Zealand team performed above expectations and England brought in four new players, one of whom was Verity. On his debut, he took four wickets for 75runs in the game. The Cricketer noted room for improvements in his technique but observed he could spin the ball well. England won the match and Verity was retained for the final Test. However, rain disrupted the match and he did not bowl. In his first full season of first-class cricket, Verity took 188wickets at an average of 13.52, finishing on top of the Yorkshire bowling averages and second in the national averages. Yorkshire won the County Championship and, according to Wisden, owed much of their success to Verity's bowling. Verity was selected as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year for his performances in the season. However, the citation said that despite his success and ability, he needed to improve the variety in <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>and</b> flight of his bowling.|$|E
5|$|The women's triathlon {{took place}} on 4 August 2012, {{featuring}} 55 women from 31 countries. Lucy Hall (Great Britain), the youngest athlete in the race, led early in the swim and finished the swim leg first {{in a time of}} 18 minutes and 27 seconds. Hall led a group of seven; Line Jensen (Denmark), Mariko Adachi (Japan), Pâmella Oliveira (Brazil), Claudia Rivas (Mexico), Laura Bennett (United States) and Jessica Harrison (France); out of the water. In {{the early stages of the}} bike leg, Hall slowed the leading pack down so that her teammate Helen Jenkins (Great Britain) could catch-up. The lead pack joined with the peloton at the end of the second cycling lap to form a 22-women strong group. Despite the chase group chasing hard, all 22 athletes finished the cycling leg in the same pack without any additions. There was a time difference of one minute and 44 seconds between the 22nd and 23rd athletes after the bike leg. Due to overnight rain the roads were wet and multiple athletes crashed on the bike leg. Two athletes in Kathy Tremblay (Canada) and Emma Moffatt (Australia) had to withdraw from the race due to crashing. Moffatt, one of the pre-race favourites crashed on the first lap of the cycling leg. The lead group quickly separated on the run leg and the lead group was down to eight athletes after one lap of the running course. They were Nicola Spirig (Switzerland), Lisa Nordén (Sweden), Erin Densham (Australia), Jenkins, Sarah Groff (United States) and Andrea Hewitt (New Zealand), Ainhoa Murúa (Spain) and Emma Jackson (Australia). Jackson was the first to get dropped and was followed by Groff and Murúa. The five remaining athletes finished the second run lap together. The group was then reduced to four when Hewitt was dropped. Groff then rejoined the group at the very start of the final run lap after been dropped earlier on in the race. With 500 metres in the final lap to race Jenkins was dropped by the other four athletes. In the ensuing sprint finish between Spirig, Nordén, Densham and Groff; Spirig pushed <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>and</b> held off a fast-finishing Nordén to win by an estimated margin of 15 centimetres. Both athletes recorded a time one hour, 59 minutes and 48 seconds, and were separated by a photo finish. Densham finished two seconds behind Spirig to win bronze. Groff finished fourth with Jenkins fifth, Hewitt sixth, Murúa seventh and Jackson eighth. After the race, Nordén and the Swedish Olympic Committee appealed against the result in the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The organisation turned down the appeal and Spirig retained the gold medal.|$|E
