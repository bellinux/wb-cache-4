5|$|After the king's victory, {{one of his}} loyal adherents, Thomas Szécsényi was {{appointed}} voivode who suppressed a Saxon revolt in 1324. At that time, the autonomous Saxon province was divided into seats, each administered by a judge appointed by the king. In appreciation of the Transylvanian noblemen's services in the crushing of the revolt, Charles I exempted <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> taxes they had so far paid to the voivodes.|$|E

5|$|Freemasonry {{and women}} have a complex relationship, which can be readily divided into many phases with no {{demonstrable}} relationship to each other until the 20th century. A few women were involved in Freemasonry before the 18th century; however the first printed constitutions of the Premier Grand Lodge of England appeared to bar <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Craft forever.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, {{only one}} in five American {{families}} had a Christmas tree. While America never lacked for real trees, the time and expense of retrieving <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wild was significant. Early in the twentieth century, however, Christmas tree farms began supplying large metropolitan areas with real trees. In the 1920s, real trees became commonplace, supplanting artificial trees in American homes.|$|E
