40|$|Bibliography: pages 62 - 67. <b>Creosote</b> treated <b>timber</b> "bleeds" profusely in {{hot weather}} and {{develops}} tarry, oily surfaces {{that are difficult to}} handle and pose a health hazard. The objective of this work is to investigate the possibility of improving the surface condition of the <b>creosote</b> treated <b>timber.</b> The possibility of using creosote macroemulsions for wood impregnation purposes was investigated. Creosote emulsions also present the possibility of improving other creosote characteristics such as penetration and distribution of creosote in wood during treatment. Creosote emulsions were successfully developed by identifying the suitable class of surfactants (anionic}, chemical type of surfactant (unsaturated fatty acids), and type of emulsion (water-in-oil). However, these emulsions could not improve the surface condition of the <b>creosote</b> treated <b>timber.</b> The penetration and distribution characteristics of both the creosote emulsion and unemulsified creosote were satisfactory. Both the creosote emulsion and the unemulsified creosote penetrated the sapwood completely but there was no penetration into the hardwood...|$|R

One hypothesis {{for this is the}} creosote, a chemical used to help preserve the wood from wear, is attracting them <b>to</b> the pilings. <b>Creosote</b> has been shown to have negative effects on the environment, and because nudibranchs’ rinophores are sensitive chemoreceptors that are used to help find food, navigate, and find mates, an interaction could be harmful to these animals. Our study looked at the preference of location in a tank with one side having creosote-treated wood and one side having non-treated wood samples. We used Triopha catalinae (Clown Dorid) and Archidoris montereyensis (Sea Lemon) as our two species. We found there was no significant preference <b>to</b> <b>creosote.</b> We also saw no preference <b>to</b> <b>creosote</b> during the day or evening, but saw a trend in T. catalinae to prefer the sides of the tank especially during the afternoon runs. There was also a trend to avoid the drain in the tank for both species. Nudibranchs therefore show no attraction <b>to</b> <b>creosote</b> in their environment...|$|R

This swing bridge, which included a 4-foot (1.2-meter) pedestrian walkway and cost $165,900, opened with a dedication ceremony on May 28, 1940, but collapsed on February 10, 1948, succumbing to a combination of a very high tide combined with an easterly wind and ice flows deeply scouring the inlet bottom under its piers; a pickup truck on the bridge {{at the time of the}} collapse fell into the inlet, killing three men who drowned inside the truck. Another concrete-and-steel swing bridge completed in 1952, the second to be named for Cullen, also became structurally unsound due to ice flow and was closed in 1962 due to storm damage.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this chapter is to {{describe}} the analytical methods that are available for detecting, measuring, and/or monitoring creosote, its metabolites, and other biomarkers of exposure and effect <b>to</b> <b>creosote.</b> The intent is not to provide an exhaustive list of analytical methods. Rather, the intention is to identify well-established methods that are used as the standard methods of analysis. Many of the analytical methods used for environmental samples are the methods approved by federal agencies and organizations such as EPA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Other methods presented in this chapter {{are those that are}} approved by groups such as the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) and the American Public Health Association (APHA). Additionally, analytical methods are included that modify previously used methods to obtain lower detection limits and/or to improve accuracy and precision. The analytical methods used <b>to</b> quantify <b>creosote</b> and related mixtures in biological and environmental samples are summarized below. As noted in Chapter 4, coal-derived mixtures (creosote, pitch, tar) are chemically very similar; the methods used for their analysis are directed to the primary components of these mixtures.

The study consisted of 2,179 employees at eleven plants in the United States where wood was treated with creosote preservatives. Some workers began work in the 1940s to 1950s.

There was little or no correlation between airborne measures and urinary 1 -hydroxypyrene (r 2 0. 05 to 0. 35). More than 90 % of 1 -hydroxy-pyrene could be attributed to dermal exposure. These data indicate that traditional monitoring methods may be inappropriate for creosote workers, raising concerns about the adequacy of methods currently mandated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

40|$|Disposal of preservative-treated {{waste wood}} {{is a growing}} problem worldwide. Bioprocessing the treated wood offers one {{approach}} to waste management under certain conditions. One goal is to use wood decay fungi to reduce the volume of waste with an easily managed system in a cost-effective manner. Wood decay fungi were obtained from culture collections in the Mycology Center and Biodeterioration research unit at the USDA-FS Forest Products Laboratory (FPL), Madison, Wisconsin, and from FPL field sites. The 95 isolates had originally been taken from at least 66 sites from around the United States. Isolates were screened in a bioassay (known as the ‘choice test’) for tolerance <b>to</b> CCA, ACQ, <b>creosote</b> and pentachlorophenol. A tolerant rating was based on fungal growth toward or on treated wood, with 17 tolerant to CCA, 21 to ACQ, 12 <b>to</b> <b>creosote</b> and 5 <b>to</b> pentachlorophenol. Decay capacity of the tolerant isolates was determined as percent weight loss by the ASTM D- 1413 - 76 soil bottle method. We identified 8 isolates for experiments on preservative remediation. Isolates of Meruliporia incrassata and Antrodia radiculosa gave the highest percent degradation of ACQ and CCA-treated wood. Several A. radiculosa isolates and a Neolentinus lepideus isolate grew on creosote-treated wood, but had only a 4 - 5 % weight loss.
