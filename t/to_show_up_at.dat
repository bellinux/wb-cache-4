5|$|Tulip mania {{reached its}} peak {{during the winter of}} 1636–37, when some bulbs were {{reportedly}} changing hands ten times in a day. No deliveries were ever made to fulfil any of these contracts, because in February 1637, tulip bulb contract prices collapsed abruptly and the trade of tulips ground to a halt. The collapse began in Haarlem, when, for the first time, buyers apparently refused <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> a routine bulb auction. This may have been because Haarlem was then at the height of an outbreak of bubonic plague. While the existence of the plague may have helped create a culture of fatalistic risk-taking that allowed the speculation to skyrocket in the first place, this outbreak might also have helped to burst the bubble.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people start}} <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the Quahog's Men's Club and Lois {{and her friends}} start to get annoyed. In order {{to get back at}} them, they enter the club. Everyone dances, except for Bonnie, because her husband is handicapped. Joe feels {{self-conscious}} about his disability, and decides to get surgery so that {{he will be able to}} walk again. When Joe comes out of the operation, he invites his friends to go do physical activities such as rock climbing, karate, and dance. Joe starts to not care about his friends and his wife, and finds three new jock friends that share his status. Lois and Peter are worried about Joe, and Lois suggests that Peter should find a new friend to replace him. Meanwhile, Joe realizes that he has outgrown Bonnie and leaves her. Desperate to get their friend back, Peter, Cleveland and Quagmire try to re-cripple Joe, failing miserably until Bonnie comes along with Joe's handgun and shoots (and misses) Joe's spine. Sick of waiting in pain, Joe takes the gun and shoots himself in the spine, re-crippling himself. They all then go to the Drunken Clam where Joe apologizes to Peter, Cleveland and Quagmire for how he acted and they all forgive him.|$|E
5|$|On December 7, 1969, Kinne was {{not present}} for a routine 5 p.m. {{roll-call}} at the Ixtapalapan prison where she was serving her sentence, but her absence was not officially noted until she also failed <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> a second roll-call later that evening. The news of her disappearance was not reported to Mexico City police until 2 a.m. the following morning. A manhunt was then arranged, initially focusing on the northern Mexican states due to authorities' belief that Kinne may have been heading for the last known whereabouts of a former inmate to whom she had grown close {{while they were in}} prison together, but also encompassing country-wide transport hubs and eventually circling back to the Mexico City area. American authorities, including the FBI, were also alerted of Mexican authorities' belief that Kinne may have been attempting to work her way back into her native country, but the FBI noted that it was unlikely to have jurisdiction in the case.|$|E

25|$|Housing the {{approximately}} 500,000 {{people in jail}} in the US awaiting trial who cannot afford bail costs $9billion a year. Most jail inmates are petty, nonviolent offenders. Twenty years ago most nonviolent defendants were released on their own recognizance (trusted <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> trial). Now most are given bail, and most pay a bail bondsman to afford it. 62% of local jail inmates are awaiting trial.|$|E
25|$|After notices are served, the {{prosecutor}} may ask {{the court to}} keep the accused in jail (remanded) or released on bail. Otherwise, the accused is released on their own recognizance (ROR'd). If the accused is released, the accused must appear in court every time their case is calendared (scheduled for a court hearing), and {{if they fail to}} appear the judge may forfeit their bail and issue a bench warrant for their arrest, although judges may excuse defendants from having <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> every court appearance.|$|E
25|$|The two suspects, 26-year-old Ahmed Ferhani and 20-year-old Mohamed Mamdouh, {{are both}} Arab-Muslim {{immigrants}} from North Africa {{that live in}} East Elmhurst, Queens. Ferhani, considered the ringleader of the plot, is from Algeria, from {{where he and his}} parents were granted asylum some 10 years prior.

25|$|The album {{featured}} virtuoso guitarist and newcomer John McLaughlin, who had {{one month}} {{prior to the}} February 18 In a Silent Way session recorded his classic debut album Extrapolation. At the request of Tony Williams, McLaughlin moved in early February from England to the US {{to play with the}} Tony Williams Lifetime. Williams brought McLaughlin to Davis' house the night before the scheduled session for In a Silent Way. Davis had not heard the guitarist before, but was so impressed that he told him <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the studio the next day. McLaughlin would go on to great fame in the 1970s as leader of the Mahavishnu Orchestra.|$|E
25|$|On October 4, 1970, {{producer}} Paul Rothchild {{became concerned}} when Joplin failed <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Sunset Sound Recorders for a recording session. Full Tilt Boogie's road manager John Cooke {{drove to the}} Landmark Motor Hotel in Hollywood where Joplin was staying. He saw Joplin's psychedelically painted Porsche 356 C Cabriolet in the parking lot. Upon entering Joplin's room (#105), he found her dead {{on the floor beside}} her bed. The official cause of death was a heroin overdose, possibly compounded by alcohol. Cooke believes Joplin had been given heroin that was much more potent than normal, as several of her dealer's other customers also overdosed that week.|$|E
25|$|Coming {{up to the}} 2011 World Championships in Daegu, Vlašić isn't the {{favourite}} at all. With 2,00 m, she's not {{leading the}} world rankings and Russia long time rival Anna Chicherova has all the expectations for the win, thanks to a Russian record of 2,07 m. Italy's Antonietta Di Martino is also in a good shape coming to the Worlds, having (as Vlašić) jumped 2,00 m outdoors but did better indoors with an Italian record of 2,04 m. Moreover, Vlašić was not sure <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the championships due ton an injury at her left leg. However, during the championships, she showed great form and managed to clear 2,03 m and earn silver medal, not being far to clear 2,05 and create history {{to become the first}} high jumper to win 3 consecutives world titles. Anna Chicherova beats the Croatian on countbacks, while Antonietta Di Martino has to settle for the bronze with 2,00 m.|$|E

25|$|Although it was {{defeated}} and suffered heavy losses, Mackay Force's actions at Vevi gained two {{days for the}} retreat and regrouping of Allied forces to the south. Despite this, {{by the time the}} Allied resistance at Klidi collapsed, the Greek 20th and 12th Divisions had yet to complete their withdrawal, and subsequently found themselves defending their resistance positions on the Mount Siniatsiko line (passes of Kleisoura, Vlasti and Siatista) in very disadvantageous terms. The Dodecanese Regiment, the most combat-worthy of the 20th Division's units, was scattered during the westward withdrawal, due to misunderstandings with the British who undertook their transport on lorries as the Regiment’s commander chose not <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the scheduled rendezvous with Battalion I and III, and remained as the reserve of the 20th Division {{for the remainder of the}} war. The bulk of the 20th Division was still straggling westward towards Mt. Siniatsiko when the German LSSAH brigade made contact with the main defensive line at Kleisoura in the evening on 13 April.|$|E
25|$|Stan {{returns home}} temporarily, but is sent into a hospice {{against his own}} will as his health {{continues}} to deteriorate. On Good Friday 2015, Dean returns to Albert Square alongside his father Buster Briggs (Karl Howman), insisting on visiting Stan at the hospital before he flees the country. Shirley calls the police to stop Dean leaving, and he is arrested for breaking his bail conditions, which saddens Stan. The following week, Stan attempts to bring his family together by asking Mick to make amends with Shirley, but although he tries, she refuses <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Stan and Cora's wedding ceremony. The ceremony is interrupted when Stan {{appears to be in}} pain, and the nurses give him pain relief. He promises Cora that they will marry the next day and she sleeps over in his room. Shirley also shows up there to be with {{him in the middle of}} the night, having had a change of heart after hearing of Jim Branning's (John Bardon) death. Stan's health rapidly deteriorates over the night, and the Carters and Cora keep a bedside vigil by his side. When Mick and Shirley argue, Stan advises them to make peace for his sake. Mick leaves while Shirley stays with Stan. Shirley reminisces the times she had with Mick when he was young. Stan hints to Shirley that she should put her family problems to rest, before dying peacefully.|$|E
500|$|A third victim turns up, {{with another}} message—"nothing ventured, nothing gained". A lens from the killer's glasses is also recovered.

Black and Horn feel this will tempt the killer <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the latest victim's memorial service. Horn attacks an innocent man at the service, believing him to be the killer; although a cross found at the memorial with [...] "ventured" [...] etched upon it proves the killer did attend. Surveillance footage of the service yields two leads—a local optician recognizes the suspect as a customer having a glasses lens replaced, and the killer's vehicle is identified.|$|E
