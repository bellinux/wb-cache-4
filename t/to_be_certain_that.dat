5|$|Cord and Chi {{infiltrate}} Nagarov's base {{to destroy}} the Super Computer. On {{the roof of a}} large tower, Cord destroys a building with a surface-to-air missile launcher to create a diversion. When he meets with Chi again, she is being threatened by Kostov, who thinks she has betrayed his men. Chi kills Kostov before he can pull the trigger. With Chi's help, Cord uses an elevator to go {{to the top of the}} tower and he activates a cable car leading to an island. Cord explores the docking area, and he finds Alexandria in a cell on the security level. Cord uses the main elevator in the complex to access the other levels. Cord creates a diversion and enters level 1, where he inserts the explosive charge into the Super Computer. A cut scene is shown that reveals that Alpha has betrayed him. In a transmission, she tells that premier Nagarov had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> Cord was not acting on her orders when he attacked the refinery. She assured Nagarov that Cord had not entered the facility, but Nagarov had a recording of Cord in the refinery. It resulted in a simple policy shift and the British are now working with the Volgians. As the reactor becomes critical, Nagarov and Lukyan leave the room. Until this moment, the game has taken place in Cord's memory, as he was interrogated by Nagarov after being captured, but from this point on it takes place in real time.|$|E
5|$|Rethinking the {{conventions}} of a Zelda game became an important theme as development progressed. In previous Zelda games, the player would go into a dungeon, obtain a new item, and then move onto the next dungeon in a specific order. The development team felt that this formula was flawed as a player could get stuck on a dungeon and {{would be unable to}} progress further in the game. They wanted to give the player more freedom in the ways they could advance through the game, allowing them to tackle dungeons in any order and clear multiple dungeons in parallel, but this meant that the method for acquiring items had to be changed. They opted for a system where players could rent or purchase items using the game's currency, rupees. In the final game, rented items are returned to the merchant when the player is defeated, however the team had considered other ideas for returning rented items, such as setting a timer on the rental period and imposing fees if they were returned late. The development team found out about the existence of the Nintendo 2DS console during the game's production. As the Nintendo 2DS lacked 3D capabilities, the team decided to revise some of the game's dungeon designs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> they could be completed without the 3D effect enabled.|$|E

25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of brain death {{needs to be}} rigorous, in order <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> the condition is irreversible. Legal criteria vary, but in general they require neurological examinations by two independent physicians. The exams must show complete and irreversible absence of brain function (brain stem function in UK), and may include two isoelectric (flat-line) EEGs 24hours apart (less in other countries where it is accepted that if {{the cause of the}} dysfunction is a clear physical trauma {{there is no need to}} wait that long to establish irreversibility). The patient should have a normal temperature and be free of drugs that can suppress brain activity if the diagnosis is to be made on EEG criteria.|$|E

25|$|None of Ward's {{friends or}} {{business}} acquaintances joined in {{his enthusiasm for}} his revolutionary idea. Although his idea was generally considered to border on lunacy and his first inventory was destroyed by the Great Chicago Fire, Ward persevered. In August 1872, with two fellow employees and a total capital of $1,600 he formed Montgomery Ward & Company. He rented a small shipping room on Normandy lane trail fleet and published a general merchandise mail-order catalog with 163 products listed. It is said that in 1880, Aaron Montgomery Ward initially wrote all catalog copy. When the business grew and department heads wrote merchandise descriptions, he still went over every line of copy <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> it was accurate.|$|E
25|$|On 15 November, Gough {{was visited}} again by Kiggell {{to discuss the}} end of the offensive. After {{consultations}} with his subordinates, Gough asked for permission to continue for two more days, weather permitting, which was given that evening. By the morning of 16 November, Gough had heard that Munich and Frankfort Trenches were still held by the Germans and that casualties had been more severe than hoped. Attacks against Serre were abandoned and the main effort was made on 18 November by II Corps pushing down towards the south bank of the Ancre. V Corps, on the north bank, was to provide flank support by capturing Frankfort Trench, advancing along Ancre Trench and taking Bois d'Hollande. The attack was delayed until 18 November, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> preparations were complete.|$|E
500|$|Geologically, {{the region}} was {{permeated}} with veins of gold, forced to the surface by volcanic action and then worn away {{by the action of}} rivers and streams, leaving nuggets and gold dust in deposits known as placer gold. Some ores lay along the creek beds in lines of soil, typically [...] to [...] beneath the surface. Others, formed by even older streams, lay along the hilltops; these deposits were called [...] "bench gold". Finding the gold was challenging. Initially, miners had assumed that all the gold would be along the existing creeks, and it was not until late in 1897 that the hilltops began to be mined. Gold was also unevenly distributed in the areas where it was found, which made prediction of good mining sites even more uncertain. The only way <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> gold was present was to conduct exploratory digging.|$|E

500|$|The 1944 Operation Bagration in Belarus {{applied the}} {{strategic}} aims and objectives {{on a grand}} scale, to deceive the Germans about the scale and objectives of the offensive. The historian Paul Adair commented that [...] "Once the Stavka had decided upon the strategic plan for their 1944 summer offensive , they began to consider how the Germans could be deceived about the aims and scale of the offensive... {{the key to the}} maskirovka operation was to reinforce the German conviction that operations would continue along this [...] axis". In particular, Stavka needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> the Germans believed the main Soviet attack would be in the south. The Soviet plan successfully kept the German reserves doing nothing south of the Pripyat marshes until the battle to the north in Belorussia had already been decided. Stavka succeeded in concealing the size and position of very large movements of supplies, as well as of forces including seven armies, eleven aviation corps and over 200,000 troop replacements. As for the strategic offensive itself, its location, strength and timing were effectively concealed. Stavka and the Red Army applied the doctrine of military deception at three levels: ...|$|E
2500|$|Even if {{no signs}} of an {{infestation}} are present, textiles should still be inspected periodically <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> there is no outbreak that has gone unobserved.

[...] Dry, cool, and dark, are to be preferred, with clean surroundings and frequent checks <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> the textiles are remaining in good condition. [...] Lighting should be kept to a minimum, and textiles should be rotated through display, so that each is only exposed to light for a few months at a time before being returned to darkness or taken for cleaning/conservation work. [...] Textiles should be vacuumed before and after display.|$|E

2500|$|One thing <b>that</b> appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Giorgione {{painted a}} female nude, {{the very first}} female nude that stands, or rather, lies, as a subject <b>to</b> <b>be</b> portrayed and admired for beauty alone. [...] There are no need for Classical {{references}} in this painting, although in later nudes Titian, Velázquez, Veronese, Rembrandt, Rubens and even Manet saw fit to add some.

2500|$|A player might {{lie about}} his own share {{to gain access to}} other shares. A verifiable secret sharing (VSS) scheme allows players <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> no other players are lying about the {{contents}} of their shares, up to a reasonable probability of error. Such schemes cannot be computed conventionally; the players must collectively add and multiply numbers without any individual's knowing what exactly is being added and multiplied. Tal Rabin and Michael Ben-Or devised a multiparty computing (MPC) system that allows players to detect dishonesty {{on the part of the}} dealer or on part of up to one third of the threshold number of players, even if those players are coordinated by an [...] "adaptive" [...] attacker who can change strategies in realtime depending on what information has been revealed.|$|E

2500|$|According to the {{canonical}} gospels, Jesus, the Christ, was arrested, tried, and sentenced by Pontius Pilate to be scourged, and finally crucified by the Romans. Jesus {{was stripped of}} his clothing and offered wine mixed with gall to drink, before being crucified. He was then hung between two convicted thieves and according to Mark's Gospel, died some six hours later. During this time, the soldiers affixed a sign {{to the top of}} the cross stating [...] "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews" [...] in three languages. They then divided his garments among them, but cast lots for his seamless robe. After Jesus' death they pierced his side with a spear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> he had died. The Bible describes seven statements that Jesus made while he was on the cross, as well as several supernatural events that occurred.|$|E
