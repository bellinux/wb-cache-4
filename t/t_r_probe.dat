40|$|Not {{very many}} studies {{measuring}} {{the effects of}} soil spatial variability in irrigation management and design have been conducted, {{and those who have}} tested this concept in the field have obtained mixed results. More research is necessary especially due to the potential of saving water and to the high water cost in certain areas of the world. In this study, the effects of the soil spatial variability upon the management and design of a micro-sprinkler irrigation system has been addressed. An irrigation system designed {{to take advantage of the}} soil spatial structure was installed in a small field (60 ft by 90 ft), and water was applied according to the local soil properties. Bulk density values as well as the soil-water retention curve parameters (field capacity and wilting point) were determined in order to ascertain the irrigation system management. Measurements of the volumetric water content "in situ" were recorded on a daily basis with the help of a <b>T.</b> D. <b>R.</b> <b>probe,</b> and those values were used to indicate the irrigation timing and the water amount to be applied in each plot in the field. Crop yield values were obtained throughout the season, and an analysis of variance was performed in each of the field sub-units. Production was compared within all the sub-units comprising the entire agricultural field, as well as a comparative study between the plots where the soil spatial variability was considered against those previously assumed to be homogeneous. Statistically, no differences in crop yield were observed when the soil was treated as homogeneous or heterogeneous for perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) turf. However, a decrease in 20 % of the seasonal water was observed when the soil spatial structure was taken into account. For this particular study, the economy associated with the lower water consumption was not sufficient to overcome the higher installation costs for the spatially variable irrigation system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} interest in developing systems that couple a robotic device with an ultrasound imager. Applications range from automatic probe positioning to ultrasound image-based guidance of instruments. One issue in these systems is to determine, prior to the intervention, the localization of the probe with respect to the robot. Literature suggests using external localizers, but they add to the complexity of the system, and the resulting precision is usually not good due to the addition of errors in the kinematic chain. In this paper, we study the hand-eye calibration problem with-out using any additional localizers. A generic system consisting of a fixed probe observing an instrument manipulated by a robot is used. We first derive a simplified model for mapping the image of the instrument with its 3 D location w. <b>r.</b> <b>t.</b> the <b>probe</b> and then propose a calibration procedure based on a minimization algorithm. Results show that although very simple models were used for the imaging device, the localization is quite precise, as it results in errors of less than 2 mm, which is enough of a number of ultrasound guided interventions.

40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} CD 4 � regulatory <b>T</b> cells (<b>T</b> <b>R)</b> that express CD 25 and {{the transcription}} factor FoxP 3 {{play a key}} role in immune homeostasis, preventing immune pathological responses to self and foreign Ags. CTLA- 4 is expressed by a high percentage of these cells, and is often considered as a marker for <b>T</b> <b>R</b> in experimental and clinical analysis. However, it has not yet been proven that CTLA- 4 has a direct role in <b>T</b> <b>R</b> function. In this study, using a T cell-mediated colitis model, we demonstrate that anti-CTLA- 4 mAb treatment inhibits <b>T</b> <b>R</b> function in vivo via direct effects on CTLA- 4 -expressing <b>T</b> <b>R,</b> and not via hyperactivation of colitogenic effector T cells. Although anti-CTLA- 4 mAb treatment completely inhibits <b>T</b> <b>R</b> function, it does not reduce <b>T</b> <b>R</b> numbers or their homing to the GALT, suggesting the Ab mediates its function by blockade of a signal required for <b>T</b> <b>R</b> activity. In contrast to the striking effect of the Ab, CTLA- 4 -deficient mice can produce functional <b>T</b> <b>R,</b> suggesting that under some circumstances other immune regulatory mechanisms, including the production of IL- 10, are able to compensate for the loss of the CTLA- 4 -mediated pathway. This study provides direct evidence that CTLA- 4 has a specific, nonredundant role in the function of normal <b>T</b> <b>R.</b> This role has to be taken into account when targeting CTLA- 4 for therapeutic purposes, as such a strategy will not only boost effector T cell responses, but might also break T R-mediated self-tolerance.
