25|$|Two of {{the neighbors}} told Dulaney that while the police sealed off the four-unit block where Hedgepeth and Rosario lived with crime scene tape, they only searched the women's {{apartment}} and not {{any of the others}} in it. Nor did they search <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>behind</b> the apartments, and they only returned later to search one other apartment in the complex. They did not seem to canvass the area, either, never knocking on doors and asking residents what they might have seen. The police also left Hedgepeth's car unsecured while they searched the apartments.|$|E
25|$|At 8:04p.m., Cst. Douglas Larche, who was plain-clothed {{but also}} wearing body armour, and {{armed with a}} shotgun, responded at Mailhot Avenue. There, he was spotted by Bourque, who then {{concealed}} himself behind several trees and fired four shots at him, wounding him. Larche returned fire with seven shots from his service pistol. Nearby residents tried to warn him about Bourque, but he was fatally shot in the neck {{as he tried to}} take cover behind his car. The entire exchange of gunfire lasted for 70 seconds. Bourque then fled the scene at 8:13p.m. and escaped into <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>behind</b> Isington Avenue. He had been last sighted near Ryan Street and Wheeler Boulevard.|$|E
25|$|On July 18, Tyler {{advanced}} to Centreville {{and found that}} Centreville was unoccupied by Confederate troops. He then marched southeast to Mitchell's Ford and Blackburn's Ford, arriving at the latter about 11 a.m. Looking south across the stream, Tyler believed that the road to Manassas Junction was clear, but he failed to see the Confederate brigade of Brig. Gen. James Longstreet concealed in <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>behind</b> the ford. He ordered two howitzers under Capt. Romeyn B. Ayres to bombard the Confederates he could see, guns of the Alexandria Artillery and the Washington Artillery, but the fire had no visible effect. He ordered Col. Israel B. Richardson and part of his brigade forward.|$|E

25|$|Early in May 1916, {{preparations}} for the offensive quickened and long convoys of lorries and carts moved constantly on roads behind the front line. After dark, trains delivered ammunition and material was carried to the front line. New trenches were dug and sandbag revetments were constructed for gas cylinders. <b>The</b> <b>woods</b> <b>behind</b> the British front line filled with men and guns. The Germans were little able to impede the preparations due to lines of balloons, from which observers detected all daylight movement behind the German front line and directed heavy artillery-fire on it. British aircraft flew over the German lines unopposed, photographing German defences and lines of communication, bombed shelters and artillery emplacements and strafed parties of infantry and cavalry. When German observation balloons ascended, they were attacked by aircraft and shot down. XV Corps (Lieutenant-General Henry Horne) held the front line from just west of Carnoy to the Becourt Wood junction with III Corps. The front line was along {{the end of the}} Fricourt Salient, the village being one of the main bastions of the German front line between the Somme and the Ancre. The slopes of the Bazentin Ridge are cut by the Willow Stream and smaller rivulets in depressions which merge between the Mametz and Fricourt Spurs. The central valley is west of Mametz Wood, to the east lies Caterpillar Valley and Contalmaison Valley lies to the north-east. Willow Stream was made the boundary of the 7th Division and the 21st Division, the 7th facing north along the Mametz Spur below the village and the 21st facing east along the west face of the Fricourt Spur.|$|E

When German observation balloons ascended, they were attacked by aircraft and shot down. XIII Corps (Lieutenant-General Walter Norris Congreve) held the front line from Maricourt westwards to Carnoy. The front line {{was close to the}} bottom of the forward (south-facing) slope of a valley between the Maricourt and Montauban ridges and the German front line was further up the slope. Maricourt Ridge declines to the east into the Hardecourt valley which contains the woods of Bois d'en Haut and Bois Favière. Beyond Montauban on the crest of the ridge lies Caterpillar Valley, beyond which are the Ginchy–Pozières ridges. A valley containing Carnoy divides into a northern branch with a pre-war light railway known as Railway Valley with a long tree plantation known as Talus Boisé along the eastern slope. The XIII Corps divisions had to ascend a long low slope, which was almost flat on the 30th Division front, cut with depressions adjacent to the Carnoy and Mametz spurs and Railway Valley, which curved eastwards below Montauban.|$|E
2500|$|Jud and Louis {{quickly become}} close friends. Since Louis' {{father died when}} he was three, he sees Jud as a {{surrogate}} father. A few weeks after the Creeds move in, Jud puts the friendship on the line when he takes the family on a walk in <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>behind</b> their home. A well-tended path leads to a pet cemetery (misspelled [...] "sematary" [...] on the sign) where the children of the town bury their deceased animals. This provokes a heated argument between Louis and Rachel the next day. Rachel disapproves of discussing death, and she worries about how Ellie may be affected by what she saw at the [...] "sematary". (It is explained later that Rachel was traumatized by the early death of her sister, Zelda, from spinal meningitis—an issue that is brought up several times in flashbacks.) ...|$|E
60|$|The rush of {{a rabbit}} through the undergrowth, startled {{him so that}} he very nearly screamed. He looked around, pallid, terrified. There {{was no one in}} sight, no sign of any life save animal and insect life in <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>behind.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] {{cried the}} Hon. Morison, aghast at this suggestion. [...] "Let's ride," [...] and he reined his pony {{into the dark}} shadows of <b>the</b> <b>wood.</b> <b>Behind</b> him came Meriem and in front, prowling ahead waiting a {{favorable}} opportunity, skulked Numa, the lion.|$|R
60|$|The girl, {{whose face}} was toward the bank {{they had just}} quitted, gave no {{evidence}} of displeasure if she noted the fierce pressure of his muscles.

2500|$|At 8 a.m. on May 28, Hampton rode {{off from}} Atlee's Station. As more of Grant's {{infantry}} crossed the pontoon {{bridge over the}} Pamunkey, Gregg led his cavalry division probing west from Hanovertown, searching for Lee, while Torbert's division began to picket along Crump's Creek {{in the direction of}} Hanover Court House. Three miles west of Hanovertown, and a mile beyond a large blacksmith shop called Haw's Shop, Gregg's troopers ran into Hampton at Enon Church, finding the Confederate cavalrymen dismounted in a wooded area, hurriedly erecting breastworks made of logs and rails, and well covered by artillery. Davies deployed pickets from the 10th New York Cavalry to Hampton's front, but the 2nd Virginia Cavalry, Hampton's leading element, drove the picket line back. The Confederates deployed in line with Wickham's four Virginia regiments deployed in <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>behind</b> Enon Church, with Rosser's men and the horse artillery to their left. They dug shallow rifle pits and faced them with log and fence-rail breastworks. Because of a swampy tributary of Crump Creek to the north and Mill Creek to the south, it was impossible to turn the position. Hampton viewed the outnumbered Union force and reportedly exclaimed, [...] "We've got the Yankees where we want them now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having {{determined}} {{to continue to}} Big Bethel without knowledge of the layout or strength of the Confederate positions, Peirce sent Duryee's 5th New York Infantry out first. Captain Kilpatrick along with Captain Charles G. Bartlett and skirmishers were sent forward to scout the Confederate position. They returned to {{the main body of}} the Union force and, after observation and talking to a black man and a local woman as well, told the officers in command that the Confederates had between 3,000 and 5,000 men and 30 pieces of artillery. They actually had about 1,4001,500 men and 5 artillery pieces, but Kilpatrick accurately reported that their position was well fortified. If the Union forces had not done enough already to give up their plan and position, Kilpatrick gave notice of the arrival of the Union force at Big Bethel by shooting at Confederate scouts and pickets. As the Union force came up to the field, they could not see the Confederates behind their fortifications but the Confederates also did not have a good view of the Union force because of the shade from <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>behind</b> the field on the right and small buildings on the left. However, they could see the bayonets and flag of a Union force about [...] to the left. Major Randolph, commanding the Howitzer Battalion, fired a shot at this column which ricocheted through the Union line and killed a soldier standing next to Colonel Bendix.|$|E
2500|$|The 9th Infantry Division's {{ultimate}} {{objective was}} Roer River crossings at Düren. [...] On September 14, 1944, {{an attack by}} the 47th Infantry Regiment captured Schevenhütte, on the northern fringes of the forest, with few casualties. The division had surprised the Germans, but lacked the strength to push on as two of their regiments were committed to the south. Attacks on and around the Höfen-Alzen ridge by the 39th and 60th Infantry Regiments met with heavy resistance and were pushed back. The 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 39th captured Lammersdorf, but could not dislodge enemies entrenched in <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>behind</b> the village; the 3rd Battalion suffered heavy losses attacking Hill 554, near Lammersdorf. In these early engagements, the 9th Infantry Division was unable to eject the Germans from {{the periphery of the}} forest, and decided to push through it to the northeast and capture Hürtgen and Kleinhau. The engagement began on September 19, 1944. [...] Repeated probes entered the forest toward their objective, but were beaten back by the terrain and Germans dug into prepared positions. On October 5, the 39th and 60th Infantry Regiments attacked towards the town of Schmidt while the 47th held a defensive position. The Monschau-Düren road was quickly cut, but both regiments were slowed by defenses and suffered significant casualties: the 60th′s 2nd Battalion was reduced to a third after the first day. The 39th was halted at the Weisser Weh Creek; there were problems with narrow paths, air bursts in trees, and fire breaks which were blocked or enfiladed. Evacuation and supply was difficult or impossible. By 16 October, [...] had been gained at the cost of 4,500 casualties. The U.S. 28th Infantry Division—a Pennsylvania National Guard unit arrived on 16 October, to relieve the battered 9th.|$|E
50|$|In 1920 <b>the</b> Bloemendaal <b>Wood</b> {{had become}} <b>the</b> {{property}} of the municipality of Bloemendaal. A small terrain in <b>the</b> <b>wood,</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> pancake house on the Mollaan, was oak coppice, where potatoes were grown. This terrain of about 2 ha. was given to a foundation in the making, that would run the new wildlife garden.|$|R

5000|$|Sun's brief {{first foray}} into x86 systems ended in the early 1990s, as it decided to {{concentrate}} on SPARC and retire the last Motorola systems and 386i products, a move dubbed by McNealy as [...] "all <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>behind</b> one arrowhead". Even so, Sun kept its hand in the x86 world, as a release of Solaris for PC compatibles began shipping in 1993.|$|R
60|$|A baron--bound to {{be a good}} knight, and {{to avenge}} my father's death!

60|$|Barney stooped {{and removed}} the bandoleer of {{cartridges}} from the fallen trooper, {{as well as his}} revolver and carbine.

6000|$|... "Come up to supper, Doctor," [...] says my lord; {{at which}} the Doctor made another low bow, and the party moved on towards a grand house that was before them, with many gray towers and vanes on them, and windows flaming in the sunshine; and a great army of rooks, {{wheeling}} over their heads, made for <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>behind</b> the house, as Harry saw; and Mr. Holt told him that they lived at Castlewood too.|$|E

60|$|That night, however, {{it rained}} heavily, {{and in the}} morning Captain Watson took a party of sailors ashore, and these succeeded in {{clearing}} away the rubbish sufficiently to get to the entrance of the cellar.
