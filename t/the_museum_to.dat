The main portion of the museum is to be located east of the tracks, with a new 500-passenger ferry terminal likely integrated into the four-story, 54,300-square-foot glass-faced building. A pedestrian bridge will connect <b>the</b> <b>museum</b> <b>to</b> the station and the northbound platform, {{as well as to}} the Water Street garage.|$|E
5|$|In February 2010, the IMA {{shifted from}} current {{environmental}} control standards within their exhibition spaces, allowing {{temperature and humidity}} fluctuation of a few degrees {{on either side of}} the suggested standard. The IMA relinquished the standard after concluding that the majority of artworks could sustain a greater range of humidity, so permitting <b>the</b> <b>museum</b> <b>to</b> save on the cost of energy bills and reduce its carbon footprint.|$|E
5|$|The Peranakan Museum {{presents}} a Southeast Asian-wide view of Peranakan culture and houses a comprehensive collection of Peranakan artefacts.

50|$|Elsewhere, <b>the</b> <b>museum</b> plans <b>to</b> {{interface}} with the Montrose community through student education.

5|$|The Smithsonian Institution {{displayed}} a Little Boy (complete, except for enriched uranium), until 1986. The Department of Energy took the weapon from <b>the</b> <b>museum</b> <b>to</b> remove its inner components, so the bombs {{could not be}} stolen and detonated with fissile material. The government returned the emptied casing to the Smithsonian in 1993. Three other disarmed bombs are {{on display in the}} United States; another is at the Imperial War Museum in London.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{love for}} its eponymous {{locomotive}} was borne out when, in 1953, Birmingham's Museum of Science and Industry determined {{that when the}} opportunity arose it would like to acquire No. 46235. When the locomotive was withdrawn in October 1964, the opportunity was taken by <b>the</b> <b>museum</b> <b>to</b> purchase it. After successive spells at Crewe Works, Nuneaton, Crewe again (for cosmetic overhaul), Saltley depot and the Birmingham Lawley Street container terminal,the locomotive was finally moved to the museum in May 1966. At that time the building was still under construction and the building was completed until 1972.|$|E
5|$|The hoard was {{acquired}} by the British Museum in April 1994. As the Museum's entire purchase fund amounted to only £1.4 million at the time, the hoard had to be purchased {{with the assistance of}} donors that included the National Heritage Memorial Fund, the National Art Collections Fund (now the Art Fund), and the J. Paul Getty Trust. The grants from these and other benefactors enabled <b>the</b> <b>museum</b> <b>to</b> raise the £1.75 million needed for the acquisition.|$|E

5|$|Around {{midnight on}} Sunday morning, March 18, 1990, a red Dodge Daytona pulled {{up near the}} side {{entrance}} of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum along Palace Road. Two men with fake police uniforms waited {{for at least an}} hour in the car, possibly trying to avoid being noticed by people leaving a St. Patrick's Day party nearby. Later at around 1a.m., security guard Richard Abath returned to the front desk after patrolling <b>the</b> <b>museum</b> <b>to</b> switch positions with the other security guard. The two guards were the only people in the building. At this time, Abath opened and quickly shut the Palace Road door, claiming he was trained to do this to ensure the door was locked. He claimed security logs from other nights would show that he had done this many times previously. The FBI has seized the logs, but has not commented on the issue further.|$|E
5|$|In 1966 the Museum's Southwark {{building}} {{was extended to}} provide collections storage and other facilities, the first major expansion since the Museum {{had moved to the}} site. The development also included a purpose-built cinema. In 1967 the museum acquired a pair of 15-inch naval guns. One had been mounted on the Royal Navy's HMS Ramillies and the other on both HMS Resolution and HMS Roberts. Both had been fired in action during the Second World War. They went on permanent display outside the museum in May 1968. The acquisition of these guns, representative of the dreadnought era of British battleships, led <b>the</b> <b>museum</b> <b>to</b> seek to acquire a 6-inch triple turret that would be representative of a number of classes of British cruisers. This would eventually lead to the preservation of the Royal Navy light cruiser , which became a branch of the museum in 1978.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Buzz and {{the other}} toys reach Al's Toy Barn. While searching for Woody, Buzz is imprisoned by a new Buzz Lightyear toy, who {{believes}} Buzz is a rogue space ranger. The new Buzz joins the other toys, who mistake him for Andy's Buzz. After revealing Al's plan, they go to his apartment, while Andy's Buzz escapes and pursues them, accidentally freeing an Emperor Zurg toy, who in turn follows him {{with the intent of}} destroying him. After the toys find Woody, Buzz rejoins them, and proves that he is Andy's Buzz, but Woody refuses to go home. Buzz reminds Woody that a toy's true purpose is to be played with, which he would never experience in a museum. After seeing a boy play with him on TV, Woody realizes Buzz was right, and asks the Roundup gang to come home with him and Andy's toys. However, Stinky Pete declines, and traps the gang, revealing that he wants to go to <b>the</b> <b>museum</b> <b>to</b> be appreciated forever, having never been sold or played with. He was also the one responsible for foiling Woody's earlier escape attempt and framing Jessie for it. Al then returns, takes the gang in a suitcase, and leaves for the airport.|$|E

5|$|The Bhuri Singh Museum at Chamba was {{established}} on 14 September 1908 {{in honour of}} the raja at the time, Raja Bhuri Singh, who ruled Chamba from 1904 to 1919. J. Ph. Vogel, an eminent indologist, and expert {{on the history of}} Chamba state, proposed <b>the</b> <b>museum</b> <b>to</b> preserve a number of valuable inscriptions, mostly in Sarda script, which contained some rare information about the medieval history of Chamba; the prashastis (inscriptions) of Sarahan, Devi-ri-kothi and mul Kihar (fountain inscription) are still preserved in the museum. Bhuri Singh donated his family collection of paintings to the museum, including royal portraits which ranged from Basohli to Guler-Kangra in style, and embroidered Pahari miniatures. Numerous artifacts, important to the heritage of Chamba were added, including coins, hill jewelry and royal and traditional costumes, arms and armour, musical instruments and other items. The current museum was built in 1975 in concrete.|$|E
5|$|The Louvre {{is owned}} by the French government; however, since the 1990s it has become more independent. Since 2003, the museum has been {{required}} to generate funds for projects. By 2006, government funds had dipped from 75percent of the total budget to 62percent. Every year, the Louvre now raises as much as it gets from the state, about €122 million. The government pays for operating costs (salaries, safety and maintenance), while the rest – new wings, refurbishments, acquisitions – is up to <b>the</b> <b>museum</b> <b>to</b> finance. A further €3 million to €5 million a year is raised by the Louvre from exhibitions that it curates for other museums, while the host museum keeps the ticket money. As the Louvre became a point of interest in the book The Da Vinci Code and the 2006 film based on the book, the museum earned $2.5million by allowing filming in its galleries. In 2008, the French government provided $180million of the Louvre's yearly $350million budget; the remainder came from private contributions and ticket sales.|$|E
5|$|The {{museum was}} opened by The King at the Crystal Palace on 9 June 1920. During the opening ceremony, Sir Alfred Mond {{addressed}} the King {{on behalf of}} the committee, saying that 'it was hoped to make the museum so complete that every one {{who took part in the}} war, however obscurely, would find therein an example or illustration of the sacrifice he or she made' and that the museum 'was not a monument of military glory, but a record of toil and sacrifice'. Shortly afterwards the Imperial War Museum Act 1920 was passed and established a Board of Trustees to oversee the governance of <b>the</b> <b>museum.</b> <b>To</b> reflect the museum's Imperial remit the board included appointees of the governments of India, South Africa, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. While the Act was being debated, some Parliamentarians felt that the museum would perpetuate an undesirable war spirit and Commander Joseph Kenworthy MP said that he would 'refuse to vote a penny of public money to commemorate such suicidal madness of civilisation as that which was shown in the late War'. On the August Bank Holiday 1920, the first public holiday since the museum's opening, 94,179 visitors were received, and by November 1921, 2,290,719 had visited the museum.|$|E
