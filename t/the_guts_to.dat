25|$|During {{his presidential}} campaign, Ma participated {{in one of}} the debates that {{discussed}} many topics, including environmental protection. The Taiwan Academy of Ecology evaluated the policies of both candidates Hsieh and Ma, and the secretary of its workstation in Taipei said that both candidates failed their expectations, but they had more hope for Hsieh than Ma because Ma's environmental concepts lack considerations of reality. In February 2008, several environmental groups created a list of commitments for the two candidates to sign. DPP candidate Frank Hsieh agreed to all the items on the list and signed it in March. Ma did not and emailed the group instead. The Taiwan Environmental Protection Union (TEPU) criticized Ma for ignoring important issues and not having <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> <b>to</b> sign the commitments.|$|E

40|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} tract presents {{the largest and}} most vulnerable surface to the outside world. Simultaneously, it must be accessible and permeable to nutrients and must defend against pathogens and potentially injurious chemicals. Integrated responses to these challenges require <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> <b>to</b> sense its environment, which it does through a range of detection systems for specific chemical entities, pathogenic organisms and their products (including toxins), as well as physicochemical properties of its contents. Sensory information is then communicated to four major effector systems: the enteroendocrine hormonal signalling system; the innervation of <b>the</b> <b>gut,</b> both intrinsic and extrinsic; <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> immune system; and the local tissue defence system.

To prevent that from happening, they began transferring their military installations away from the border regions to locations deeper within Cambodian territory. A new command center was established at the city of Kratié and the timing of the move was propitious. President Nixon was of the opinion that: [...] "We need a bold move in Cambodia to show that we stand with Lon Nol...something symbolic...for the only Cambodian regime that had <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> <b>to</b> take a pro-Western and pro-American stand." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{experience}} of the M3 in the North African Campaign was completely different. The gun was not powerful {{enough to deal with}} late production German Panzer III and IV tanks. After the nearly disastrous Battle of Kasserine Pass in February 1943, reports from some of the involved units mentioned 37mm projectiles [...] "bouncing off like marbles" [...] from the turret and front armor of German medium tanks and proclaimed the gun [...] "useless unless you have gun crews with <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> <b>to</b> stand and shoot from 100yards". The Army was initially uncertain if these reports reflected the obsolescence of the weapon, or whether unrefined tactics and lack of experience were to blame. Yet, on 26 May 1943, a new organization had the M3 replaced by the 57mm Gun M1 (the U.S.-produced version of the British 6-pounder gun), with Dodge 1½ ton trucks as prime movers. Only by spring 1944 did the 57mm gun reach the battlefield in large numbers.|$|E

IGN's Douglas Perry called it [...] "a kick, albeit relatively lightweight in nature". He especially praised the pervasive sense of humor in the narrative and in the portrayal of real-world skaters. Knutson called the story [...] "unique" [...] and stated, [...] "I really like that Neversoft had <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> <b>to</b> try something this radical and ditch the formula that they know works so well." [...] Ben Silverman of Game Revolution described the game's plot as a [...] "silly" [...] cross between those of the 1980s films North Shore and Gleaming the Cube, but he praised it for giving context to the level goals and keeping distance between the skill unlocks. Bramwell called it [...] "hackneyed". Rybicki found that the plot hurt the game's replay value and caused missions to be overly simplistic.

40|$|The primary {{functions}} of <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> are <b>to</b> absorb nutrients and exclude bacteria and their products. However, {{under certain circumstances}} <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> may lose its barrier function {{and serve as a}} reservoir for systemic microbial infections. These experiments were performed to determine the mechanisms whereby endotoxin causes bacteria to escape (translocate) from <b>the</b> <b>gut.</b> Bacteria translocated from <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mesenteric lymph nodes of mice challenged with nonlethal doses of Escherichia coli 026 :B 6 or E. coli 0111 :B 4 endotoxin. Physical disruption of <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> mucosal barrier appears to be the primary mechanism whereby endotoxin promotes bacterial translocation. Mucosal injury and endotoxin-induced bacterial translocation were reduced by inhibition (allopurinol) or inactivation (tung-sten diet) of xanthine oxidase activity (P less than 0. 01), but were not affected by the platelet-activation factor antagonists, SRI 63 - 441 or BN 52021. Because the inhibition or inactivation of xanthine oxidase activity reduced both the extent of mucosal injury and endotoxin-induced bacterial translocation, the effect of endotoxin on <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> appears <b>to</b> be mediated, at least to some degree, by xanthine oxidase-generated, oxygen-free radicals...|$|R

Memorable moments for Williams include Sam and Dean singing [...] "Wanted Dead or Alive", and Dean admitting that his love for Sam is his main weakness. Likewise, TV Guides Tina Charles described the episode as [...] "creepy and suspenseful and funny and sad and just plain awesome", and felt it came close to outdoing the first-season finale [...] "Devil's Trap". Especially praised were the actors' performances. Padalecki [...] "totally {{stepped up to the plate}} and knocked one out of the park", and Ackles was [...] "nine kinds of awesome". On the latter, Charles noted, [...] "From acting out Dean's stubborn ways, his inappropriate humor, those crushing looks of despair and doom and Dean's death, the man can play it all." [...] McCormick was described as [...] "creepy", leading to Charles' [...] "huge compliment" [...] of comparing the episode to The Twilight Zone. For the critic, the [...] "totally unexpected" [...] Bon Jovi sing-along [...] "totally rocked" [...] and has [...] "instantly become a classic". Her main disappointment with the episode, however, was the lack of Sam [...] "going dark side". Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune listed the episode as one of the [...] "gems" [...] of the third season, and believed it likely to end up as one of her [...] "Favorite 'Supernatural' Episodes of All Time".

50|$|M cells {{play a role}} in passive immunity, or the {{transfer}} of active humoral immunity during and post pregnancy. Infants rely on antibodies specific to their mother's intestinal antigens, which move from <b>the</b> mother's <b>gut</b> and enter <b>the</b> breast milk. These antibodies are able to move into the milk supply through the lymphatic system. Even though the mechanism of this transport is not fully understood, it is hypothesized that dendritic cells and macrophages play the role of transport vehicles. In females that are not lactating, when M cells recognize antigen in <b>the</b> <b>gut,</b> they stimulate production of many Immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies. These antibodies are released into <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> mucosa, salivary glands, and lymph nodes. However, in females that are lactating, M cells recognize antigen and IgA is directed from <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mammary gland. IgA traveling from <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> <b>to</b> breast milk supply is controlled by hormones, chemokines, and cytokines.
