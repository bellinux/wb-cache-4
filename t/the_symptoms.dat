5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} {{should be}} suspected {{if any of}} <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> associated with the condition occurs following a drop in pressure, in particular, within 24 hours of diving. In 1995, 95% of all cases reported to Divers Alert Network had shown symptoms within 24 hours. An alternative diagnosis should be suspected if severe symptoms begin more than six hours following decompression without an altitude exposure or if any symptom occurs more than 24 hours after surfacing. The diagnosis is confirmed if <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> are relieved by recompression. Although MRI or CT can frequently identify bubbles in DCS, {{they are not as}} good at determining the diagnosis as a proper history of the event and description of <b>the</b> <b>symptoms.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a discussion about}} the so called current symptoms and its relations with ways of jouissance. It begins with a definition of what might be <b>the</b> current <b>symptoms</b> before exploring <b>the</b> actual notion of the term and its unfolding about <b>the</b> <b>symptom.</b> In a second moment, it articulates <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> with ways of jouissance, demonstrating how much jouissance is connected to <b>the</b> <b>symptom.</b> More specifically, it is in <b>the</b> <b>symptom’s</b> meaning that jouissance is found, since it is through meaning that jouissance is connected to <b>the</b> <b>symptom.</b> It is not about reducing jouissance due to the search of pleasure or to search in pleasure the relief of the jouissance’s tension. It is about, in psychoanalysis, to potentialize the jouissance no more connected to <b>the</b> <b>symptom’s</b> meaning, but to articulate it to the sinthome, so the subject can jouir life and not <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> anymore...|$|R

5|$|The hormones of the {{pituitary}} {{have different}} {{actions in the}} body, and <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> of hypopituitarism therefore depend on which hormone is deficient. <b>The</b> <b>symptoms</b> may be subtle and are often initially attributed to other causes. In most of the cases, three or more hormones are deficient. The most common problem is insufficiency of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or luteinizing hormone (LH) leading to sex hormone abnormalities.

The relabeling intervention is done within the session by the therapist to change the connotation of one symptom from negative to positive. In this way the family can view <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> in a new context or have a new conceptual understanding of <b>the</b> <b>symptom.</b>|$|R
25|$|This {{abridged}} {{version of the}} K-SADS focuses on mania and is a combination/modification of Geller's WASH-U-KSADS and the 4th revision of the KSADS-P (by Joaquim Puig-Antich and Neal Ryan) Specifically, it assess 21 symptoms related to mania, hypomania, and rapid cycling. Each item is rated on a 0-6 rating scale. Scores of 0 suggest no information is available; scores of 1 suggest <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> is not present at all; scores of 2 suggest <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> is slightly present; scores of 3 suggest <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> is mildly severe; scores of 4 suggest <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> is moderately severe; scores of 5 suggest <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> is severe; and scores of 6 suggest <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> is extremely severe. Items with scores of 4 or higher are clinically significant/maladaptive. Trained clinicians or clinical researchers administer the assessment to both {{the child and the}} parent, which each provide their own separate score for each item (P and C), and the total score encompasses the sum of all of the items (S).|$|R

40|$|Twenty-four-hour esophageal pH {{monitoring}} {{is useful}} for the quantitative measurement of gastroesophageal reflux and for the demonstration of a temporal relationship between <b>symptoms</b> and reflux. <b>The</b> <b>symptom</b> index, a numerical score, was developed to quantify <b>the</b> association between <b>symptoms</b> and reflux.

Because of certain limitations of this score, we developed and evaluated a new score, <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> sensitivity index, that quantifies the subject's sensitivity for reflux. Fifty-two consecutive patients, referred to our laboratory for ambulatory 24 -h pH recording were studied. Beside the conventional reflux variables, both indexes were calculated.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} which sensory (symptom persistence and intensity) and reactive (activity and affective interference) domains of symptom analysis {{are essential for}} assessing symptom burden in dry eye disease (DED) patients. Methods: A symptom domain tool was developed to investigate all four symptom domains in DED. In a cross-sectional pilot study, we administered <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> burden tool and the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire to 48 DED patients. Total and domain scores from <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> burden tool and the OSDI were normalized to achieve comparability. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to measure the relationship between domains and subscales. Agreement between <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> burden tool and OSDI was assessed by Bland-Altman plot. Assigned treatments were compared by symptom burden to determine whether treatment aggressiveness is linked to symptom intensity. Results: There was high agreement between <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> burden tool and <b>the</b> OSDI. <b>Symptom</b> persistence had a stronger correlation with affective interference (r = 0. 62 for <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> burden tool and r = 0. 73 for the OSDI) than activity interference (r = 0. 58 for <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> burden tool and r = 0. 60 for <b>the</b> OSDI). <b>Symptom</b> intensity correlated weakly with affective interference (r = 0. 38) and activity interference (r = 0. 37) in <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> burden tool (OSDI {{does not have a}} subscale for intensity).

Namen dela je nakazati, da simptom ni zgolj fiziološka manifestacija, temveč simbolna konstrukcija, ki v nekakšni miniaturni obliki predstavlja zgoščeno strukturo kulture. Tako bo v delu simptom prikazan, kot socio-somatična tvorba, ki povezuje subjektivno s kolektivnim v kontekstu patologije, kakor tudi normalnosti. Prav tako, delo obravnava nekatere epistemološke ovire antropološkega razumevanja simptoma. V nalogi bo predstavljen tudi Lacanov koncept »sintoma«, pri čemer bo nakazano, kaj pomeni aplikacija tega koncepta na področje antropološkega preučevanja simptoma.
