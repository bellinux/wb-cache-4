When confronted by his friends, Kabir confesses {{to the other two}} that he is still not ready for a marriage, and that Natasha had gotten <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>idea</b> (of him proposing to her) on seeing the ring that he had bought for his mother as a birthday present. On the morning of the bull run, Imran suggests they make a pact to make a promise if they survive the event. Imran vows to publish his poetry (which he has penned down in his private diary), Arjun vows to go to Morocco with Laila, and Kabir promises to tell Natasha that {{he does not want to}} marry her. As they complete the event, the friends gain a renewed sense of their relationships with each other, with others they know, and with themselves.|$|E

[...] Lyrically, the song is about a woman's sexual frustration of being unnoticed by a man. [...] Joe Macare of Stylus Magazine described Buena's delivery of the lyric [...] "my sexy ass" [...] as [...] "carefree", and noted that the lyrics adapt an [...] "idiosyncratic approach" [...] to the English language.

In one, he seemingly {{uses the word}} nigga, which caused #PewdiepieIsOverParty to trend worldwide on Twitter. A few days later, PewDiePie created further controversy, when he uploaded a video featuring him reviewing the website Fiverr, which allows people to sell a service for $5 USD. In the video, PewDiePie shows his reaction to a duo he had paid to display the message [...] "DEATH TO ALL JEWS" [...] on a sign, as a joke and attempt to highlight the ridiculous things which can be provided as a paid service on the Internet. He immediately apologised within the same video stating, [...] "I am sorry. I didn't think they would actually do it. I feel partially responsible," [...] adding [...] "I'm not anti-Semitic, [...] so don't get <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>idea.</b> It was a funny meme, and I didn't think it would work, okay." [...] PewDiePie received criticism from some users in the video's comment section, {{as well as from}} some media outlets. As a result of this video, both PewDiePie and the duo were banned from Fiverr, prompting the latter to upload an apology video stating that they did not understand the meaning of the sign, and that they were sorry to all Jews.|$|E
500|$|The stage play Being Sellers premiered in Australia in 1998, {{three years}} after the release of the {{biography}} by Roger Lewis, The Life and Death of Peter Sellers. [...] In 2004, the book was turned into an HBO film with the same title, starring Geoffrey Rush. The play later transferred to New York in December 2010. The Belfast Telegraph notes how the film captured Sellers's [...] "life of drugs, drink, fast cars and lots and lots of beautiful women". Although the film was widely praised by critics, both Lord Snowdon and Britt Ekland were highly critical of the film and the enactment of Sellers; Ekland believed that the film left the audiences with <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>idea</b> of her former husband, saying [...] "the film leaves you with the impression that Peter Sellers was essentially a likeable man when in reality he was a monster. He may have been a brilliant actor, but as a human being he had no saving graces at all". Snowdon disagreed with Ekland's verdict, and with the film, and stated that Sellers [...] "had a light touch, a sense of humour, I can't bear to see him portrayed as somebody who was apparently without either... The man on the screen is charmless, humourless and boring—the one thing you could never say about Peter." ...|$|E

500|$|In October 1998, Toyah {{became the}} first female Coronation Street {{character}} {{to be involved in}} a storyline surrounding the subject of under-age sex. Toyah, who was sixteen at the time, had a holiday romance with Philip [...] "Dobber" [...] Dobson (John Donnelly). She quickly introduced him to her parents and was prepared to do anything for him, like stealing from the local café. When Dobber asked Toyah to have sex with him, she agreed, despite knowing that she should wait. Toyah was scared that if she said no, Dobber would break up with her. Toyah was persuaded to lose her virginity to Dobber {{in the back of his}} car. The storyline was branded [...] "controversial" [...] and [...] "shocking", while watchdogs stated that it sent out <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>ideas</b> to young schoolgirls. Taylor defended the storyline and her character, saying [...] "We have taken a strong moral line and are not promoting teenage sex. It's quite the opposite.

[...] However, a review of studies done with very young {{children}} found no consistent differences between boys and girls. Critics say that because his work has focused on higher-functioning individuals with autism spectrum disorders, his work requires independent replication with broader samples. A Nature article published in 2011 says, [...] "Some critics are also rankled by Baron-Cohen's history of headline-grabbing theories—particularly one that autism is an 'extreme male' brain state.

Pete grows jealous of Kathy and James's working relationship. Kathy ignores his protests and confides in James about Pete after work one night; however, James gets <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>idea,</b> attempts to seduce Kathy and, when she turns him down, rapes her. Pete struggles {{to come to terms with}} this and begins entertaining the idea that the sex was consensual and not rape. Kathy grows depressed and isolates herself from Pete, who begins drinking heavily. After various drunken binges, Kathy finally makes the decision to leave him. Later she is courted by Laurie Bates (Gary Powell), another fruit and veg stall owner who opens in direct competition to Pete; Pete and Laurie are regularly at loggerheads. Pete tries to retaliate towards Kathy's new relationship by producing his own love interest in the shape of Barbara, a woman he meets in New Zealand. It is a bluff however, as Pete still wants Kathy back but she makes it abundantly clear that she has moved on.|$|E

2500|$|The {{three main}} issues were RCA {{position}} on homosexuality, {{the adoption of}} the Belhar confession and complementarianism. Beyond the three reasons University Reformed Church mentioned: [...] "We have a deep desire to belong to a family of churches where who we are as a congregation fits squarely with what our denomination does and believes." [...] "We want to raise up pastors who do not fear that the ordination process is against them"."We want to work alongside churches that share our convictions." [...] "We {{want to be in a}} denomination that sees us as occupying center ground, notsome extreme right flank". [...] "The denomination(RCA) has moved away from churches like ours." [...] "We want to work alongside churches that share our convictions." [...] "In practice, the RCA is already well down this path [...] and that given the way our classical structure works those who stand for biblical orthodoxy can do little to stop it. We believe laboring in such a mixed denomination undermines the true nature of biblical unity, hinders our witness for Christ, and does not represent the most effective avenue for ministry for URC in the years and decades ahead." [...] "URC would be able to serve with greater integrity and disciple our people (especially ministerial candidates) more effectively if we were in a denomination that shares our complementarian convictions, rather than in one that is moving full speed ahead in the other direction." [...] "We(URC) are troubled by the weak form of confessional subscription in the RCA, the process for examining ministerial candidates, and our formal ecumenical ties with liberal denominations like the UCC, ELCA and PCUSA". [...] "We have often heard from visitors that though they lived in Lansing for years they never thought to visit URC because it was an RCA church or because of things they had heard about liberal leanings in the RCA. How many others might be staying away because our denominational affiliation gives them <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>idea</b> about who we are and what we believe?"We do not recommend our RCA seminaries. [...] "We want to be in a denomination that sees us as occupying center ground, not some extreme right flank". [...] "The RCA connection inhibits interest in planting churches, the vision for training up pastors, and placement for new pastors."

He held as straight {{a course for}} {{the house of the}} dolls' dressmaker as the wisdom of his ancestors, exemplified {{in the construction of the}} intervening streets, would let him, and walked with a bent head hammering at one fixed idea. It had been an immoveable idea since he first set eyes upon her. It seemed to him as if all that he could suppress in himself he had suppressed, as if all that he could restrain in himself he had restrained, and the time had come--in a rush, in a moment--when the power of self-command had departed from him. Love at first sight is a trite expression quite sufficiently discussed; enough that in certain smouldering natures like this man's, that passion leaps into a blaze, and makes such head as fire does in a rage of wind, when other passions, but for its mastery, could be held in chains. As a multitude of weak, imitative natures are always lying by, ready to go mad upon <b>the</b> next <b>wrong</b> <b>idea</b> that may be broached--in these times, generally some form of tribute to Somebody for something that never was done, or, if ever done, that was done by Somebody Else--so these less ordinary natures may lie by for years, ready on the touch of an instant to burst into flame.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Human {{values and}} {{folklore}} of wildlife strongly influence {{the effectiveness of}} conservation efforts. These values and folklore may also vary with certain demographic characteristics such as gender, age, or education. Reptiles and amphibians are among the least appreciated of vertebrates and are victims of many negative values and <b>wrong</b> <b>ideas</b> resulting from <b>the</b> direct interpretation of folklore. We try to demonstrate how these values and folklore can affect the way people relate to them and also the possible conservation impacts on these animals. Methods A questionnaire survey distributed to 514 people {{in the district of}} Évora, Portugal, was used to obtain data regarding the hypothesis that <b>the</b> existence of <b>wrong</b> <b>ideas</b> and negative values contributes to the phenomenon of human-associated persecution of these animals. A structural equation model was specified in order to confirm the hypothesis about the possible relationships between the presence of perceptions and negative values about amphibians and reptiles and persecution and anti-conservation attitudes. Sociodemographic variables were also added. Results The results of the model suggest that the presence of folklore and negative values clearly predicts persecution and anti-conservation attitudes towards amphibians and reptiles. Also, the existence of folklore varies sociodemographically, but negative values concerning these animals are widespread in the population. Conclusions With the use of structural equation models, this work is a contribution to the study of how certain ideas and values can directly influence human attitudes towards herpetofauna and how they can be a serious conservation issue. </p...|$|R

The socio-cultural and the subjective aspects were taken into consideration in the conceptual change texts, which are presented in the study.

The prepared conceptual change texts were piloted in a secondary school in Trabzon in 2008 - 2009 education year. 22 students participated in pilot study. Some defects were identified and the necessary adjustments were made at the end of pilot. For example, some corrections were made in the section about <b>the</b> reasons of <b>wrong</b> <b>ideas.</b> In <b>the</b> last section of conceptual change texts, coming to a conclusion questions were added to lead the direction to the intended point.
