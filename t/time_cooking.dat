40|$|ABSTRACT The {{development}} of new common bean cultivars with grain characteristics that achieve greater acceptance by consumers and faster <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> is a recent trend in bean breeding programs. This study aimed at evaluating whether different common bean lines exhibit differences in grain morphological traits and <b>cooking</b> <b>time,</b> investigating the linear relationships between these traits and <b>cooking</b> <b>time,</b> and selecting lines with superior grain commercial characteristics and faster <b>cooking</b> <b>times.</b> A randomized blocks design with three replications was used. Treatments consisted of 14 common bean genotypes grown during two seasons. Differences in the mass of 100 grains and grain length, width, thickness, shape, flatness, percentage of water uptake and <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> were observed between lines. A high positive correlation was observed between grain thickness and <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> (r = 0. 9727). The path analysis revealed that grain thickness had the highest positive direct effect on <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> (0. 62). Therefore, fast-cooking common bean lines can be indirectly selected based on lower grain thicknesses. The DF 06 - 17 line presents fast-cooking grains with characteristics well accepted by the market and consumers...|$|R
2500|$|In 1982, Scott Thorson, Liberace's 22-year-old former chauffeur and live-in {{lover of}} five years, sued the pianist for $113 million in palimony {{after he was}} let go by Liberace. Liberace {{continued}} to deny that he was homosexual, and during court depositions in 1984, he insisted that Thorson was never his lover. The case was {{settled out of court}} in 1986, with Thorson receiving a $75,000 cash settlement, plus three cars and three pet dogs worth another $20,000. Thorson stated after Liberace's death that he settled because he knew that Liberace was dying and that he had intended to sue based on conversion of property rather than palimony. He later attested that Liberace was a [...] "boring guy" [...] in his private life and mostly preferred to spend his free <b>time</b> <b>cooking,</b> decorating, and playing with his dogs, and also that he never played the piano outside of his public performances. According to Thorson: [...] "He (Liberace) had several decorated, ornamental pianos in the various rooms of his house, but he never played them." [...] Thorson also remarked that he was not aware that Liberace had any health issues prior to contracting acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and up until one year before his death that: [...] "He was in overall excellent shape for his age; barrel-chested and powerfully built." ...|$|E
60|$|Kate and I had {{a hilarious}} <b>time</b> <b>cooking</b> that supper.

But we were both very tired, {{and as soon as}} we had finished eating we betook ourselves to our tent and found our brush beds much more comfortable than I had expected. Old Peter coiled up on his blanket outside by the fire, and the great silence of a windless prairie enwrapped us. In a few minutes we were sound asleep and never wakened until seven o'clock.|$|E

When the sun was well up he saddled Bullet, and, leaving the trail where his tracks showed plain in the ground, he put his horse to the rocks and brush. He {{selected}} an exceedingly rough, roundabout, and difficult course to Ord, hid his tracks with the skill of a long-hunted fugitive, and arrived there with his horse winded and covered with lather. It added considerable to his arrival that the man Duane remembered as Fletcher and several others saw him come in the back way through the lots and jump a fence into the road.|$|E

50|$|The higher {{temperature}} causes food to cook faster; <b>cooking</b> <b>times</b> can typically {{be reduced}} to one-third of the <b>time</b> for conventional <b>cooking</b> methods. The actual <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> also depends on the pressure release method used after timing (see Pressure release methods for details) and the thickness and density of the food, since thicker (and denser) foods take longer to cook. Meat joints and some other foods like sponge puddings and Christmas puddings are typically timed according to their weight. Frozen foods need extra <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> to allow for thawing.|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to understand how genotype, storage time, and storage conditions affect <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> of beans and to indicate storage techniques that do not affect the <b>cooking</b> <b>time.</b> The grains were subjected to five different storage periods and six different storage conditions. The <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> was estimated using the Mattson Cooker. The data were subjected to analysis of variance and a subsequent adjustment of simple linear regression for deployment of the interactions between the factors. Contrasts were used to determine the best levels of the factor storage condition. Genotype did not impact <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> when the storage time and storage conditions were considered. Time and storage conditions affect the <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> of beans in a dependent manner, but time of storage had the biggest influence. The best conditions for long-term storage of beans ensuring a smaller increase in <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> is plastic storage at low temperatures. Thus, plastic freezer storage is a practical alternative for consumers...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTFour cowpea {{varieties}} (Brown beans, Oloka beans, IAR 48 and IT 89 KD- 288) were toasted at 105 °C, {{and used}} to study the effect of dry heat treatment on the <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> and nutrient composition of cowpea seeds and also {{its effect on the}} functional properties of resultant flour of the cowpea seed varieties. Toasting reduced the <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> for brown and oloka cowpea varieties from 55. 00 – 31. 00 and 70. 67 – 51. 67 min, respectively. The <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> for IAR 48 and IT 89 KD- 288 cowpea varieties increased from 104. 67 to 106. 00 and 88. 00 to 88. 67 min, respectively. The results indicate that the <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> of cowpea seeds can be reduced significantly on toasting, while maintaining their potential as functional agents in the food industry for nutrition and utilisation. Correlation between the amount of water imbibed by cowpea seeds and their <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> was - 0. 74, but was not significant at p≤ 0. 05, suggesting that there is no significant relationship between the amount of water imbibed by cowpea seeds and their <b>cooking</b> <b>time...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were to study the genetic variability and the interaction between genotypes and environments for <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> and protein content of bean grains {{as well as to}} identify elite lines of Carioca grain type with short <b>cooking</b> <b>time,</b> high protein content and high adaptability and stability for these two traits. Sixteen experiments were conducted in a complete randomized block design with three replications during the rainy, dry and winter seasons, in Goiás, Distrito Federal, Pernambuco, Sergipe, Bahia and Paraná States, in 2009 and 2010. Each trial was composed by 16 elite lines of Carioca grain type and the data of <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> and protein content were obtained. Data were submitted to analysis of variance and to stability and adaptability analysis, according to the methodology proposed by Annichiarico. Genetic variability was found for <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> and for protein content among Carioca common bean elite lines; however, for protein content this variability is lower. The environmental effect is important for the expression of these traits and is larger than the genetic effect. The interaction between genotypes and environments is important for <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> and for protein content of common beans. The lines CNFC 11951 and CNFC 11962 presents short <b>cooking</b> <b>time,</b> high protein content and high stability and adaptability for both traits...|$|R
