500|$|The first notable {{eruption}} from Mount Cleveland was a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) 3 Vulcanian eruption {{that occurred}} between June 10 and June 13, 1944. Lava flows extended [...] from the summit, and an ash plume [...] high was produced. Large boulders were reportedly ejected {{and carried out}} to sea by eruptive force. The eruption had {{the distinction of being}} the only confirmed direct volcanic fatality in Alaska; a small detachment from the Eleventh Air Force was stationed on the volcano at the time, and one Sergeant Purchase left his post early in the eruption <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> and never returned, probably killed by mudslides. At approximately 10:20, a boat sent to search for Purchase witnessed the end of the eruption. The island was abandoned {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E
500|$|Fonville's son, Carl Eric Fonville, {{later wrote}} {{that his father}} was troubled by the unequal {{treatment}} given to African-American athletes during the Kansas meet at which he set the world record. Upon arriving at the Kansas Relays, Fonville and Harrison Dillard of Baldwin-Wallace College were housed at the home of a black family. His son wrote: [...] "Without unpacking they decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> to the University of Kansas campus where they found the other visiting white athletes being given campus tours and their treatment far different than their own. They both considered leaving but decided to stay and compete. Charles called Ann Arbor, Michigan to tell them that he wanted leave, he got Don Canham who told him that he was 'Sent to Kansas City to represent the University of Michigan,' the conversation was short and clear." [...] Fonville and Dillard both set new world records at the event.|$|E

From his working-class roots... {{to the upper}} echelons of Catholic power—carrying a Christian message of peace and love {{to some of the}} world's worst war-torn terrain". Following his tour of the Archdiocese, O'Brien lamented the large presence of poverty and violence in Baltimore, saying, [...] "I think anybody who wants <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> can find areas with very nice homes, well-kept lawns, good streets and sidewalks, and maybe 15 minutes later find themselves in a neighborhood that is just racked, torn apart, as if a war had just been fought." ...|$|E

2500|$|During that time, {{she tries}} to {{convince}} Homer {{that it was the}} one thing that was missing because their lives would be miserable without Bart, Lisa and Maggie. He proved to be more unconvinced and more depressed after seeing that his life {{would have been a lot}} better if he had won, even leaping into the pot to try to [...] "live in the sauce". The saucier bashes him for his foolishness and saying if you could live in the sauce, then he would have jumped in himself. Marge convinces him <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> with her to the Springfield Wall of Fame. Eventually, he agrees and learns that his name has been put up. Marge reveals that she confronted Dondelinger and forced him to do the right thing. A boy then has his picture taken with him. Homer, now much happier, goes to a Korean restaurant that Bart says 'sells beef that spells the date of your death'.|$|E
2500|$|Known in {{the family}} as [...] "Stassie", Anastasia Mikhailovna was the only {{daughter}} among seven children. She was the object of devotion not only as her father's favorite, but was spoiled by her six brothers. Her father was occupied with his militaristic and governmental activities, while her mother, a strict disciplinarian, showed little affection and raised the children with an iron hand. Anastasia's brothers found in her an outlet for love and tenderness that was so lacking in their parents. She was raised separately from her brothers most of the time, joining them only on Sundays when they were all allowed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> together. She was particularly close to her eldest brother, Nicholas Michailovich, with whom she shared artistic interest. She {{grew up to be}} very independent, intelligent and strong-willed, with a warm and happy personality. Tall and slim, she had dark hair and green oriental eyes. Her education centered in languages; she learned French, German, and English besides her native Russian.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, while Matson {{was giving}} {{readings}} in the Northwest, {{he was invited}} by Jack Estes to teach a workshop at Peninsula State College in Port Angeles, Washington. Matson asked for guidance. [...] "It's easy," [...] Estes replied, [...] "give the exercise David Wagoner gave last month. He divided the psyche into the same three parts as Transactional Analysis and renamed them Editor, Writer, and Child. Tell the Editor and Writer <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> and let the Child write whatever it likes." [...] When Matson stepped into the classroom, every comment fit those voices: analytical – from the Editor; understanding of the process – from the Writer; and impulsive or emotional – from the Child. Matson felt he was the custodian for everyone's creativity. He returned to the Bay Area, took over John Oliver Simon's Learning Annex writing workshop, and tried out different articulations of the [...] "Child" [...] voice, eventually settling on [...] "Crazy Child." [...] That designation stimulated the most vigorous and most original writing. In 1985 Matson started teaching at University of California Berkeley Extension, specializing in beginning courses [...] "Developing Your Creative Writing Style" [...] and [...] "Exploring Your Creative Writing Potential." [...] He took notes for his tutorial, Let the Crazy Child Write! (published by New World Library in 1998). He taught at various other venues: Pacific Oaks College in Pasadena, California; John F. Kennedy University in Orinda; Oakland Summer Arts Camp in the Sierra; and led writing excursions in Scotland, Italy, Costa Rica, and the eastern Sierra.|$|E
