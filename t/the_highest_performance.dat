Both designs featured huge wing tip fuel tanks that could be jettisoned when their fuel was depleted before a supersonic dash to the target. The tanks also included the outer portions of the wing, which would also be jettisoned to produce a smaller wing suitable for supersonic speeds. Both became trapezoidal wings after ejection, at that time <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>performance</b> planform known. They also featured flush cockpits to maintain the highest fineness ratio possible in spite of its effects on visibility.|$|E
5|$|Born in Bohemia (then part of Austrian Empire) as a German-speaking Jew of humble circumstances, Mahler {{displayed}} {{his musical}} gifts {{at an early}} age. After graduating from the Vienna Conservatory in 1878, he held a succession of conducting posts of rising importance in the opera houses of Europe, culminating in his appointment in 1897 {{as director of the}} Vienna Court Opera (Hofoper). During his ten years in Vienna, Mahler—who had converted to Catholicism to secure the post—experienced regular opposition and hostility from the anti-Semitic press. Nevertheless, his innovative productions and insistence on <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>performance</b> standards ensured his {{reputation as one of the}} greatest of opera conductors, particularly as an interpreter of the stage works of Wagner, Mozart, and Tchaikovsky. Late in his life he was briefly director of New York's Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic.|$|E

25|$|Until the mid-1940s, the {{traditional}} horizontal four-stroke single-cylinder 500cc engines were fitted with one overhead and one side valve but {{contrary to the}} usual practice of having inlet over exhaust (IOE), this employed the side valve for induction and the overhead valve for exhaust.

As such, these cars may differ only slightly from a patrol car, including having radar and laser speed detection equipment, traffic cones, flares, and traffic control signs.|$|E

2500|$|The Z06 model {{replaced}} the FRC model as <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>performance</b> C5 Corvette. Instead of a heavier double-overhead cam engine like the ZR-1 of the C4 generation, the Z06 used an LS6, a [...] derivative {{of the standard}} LS1 engine. Using the much more rigid fixed roof design allowed the Z06 unprecedented handling thanks to upgraded brakes and less body flex. Those characteristics, along {{with the use of}} materials such as a titanium exhaust system and a carbon fiber hood in the 2004 model year, led to further weight savings and performance gains for the C5 Z06. The LS6 was later upgraded to for 2002–2004. Although the Z06's rated power output equal to that of the C4 ZR-1, the improved rigidity, suspension, brakes, and reduced weight of the C5 produced a car quicker than C4 ZR-1.|$|E

2500|$|In the Cassegrain and Gregorian antennas, the {{presence}} of two reflecting surfaces in the signal path offers additional possibilities for improving performance. [...] When <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>performance</b> is required, a technique called [...] "dual reflector shaping" [...] may be used. [...] This involves changing {{the shape of the}} sub-reflector to direct more signal power to outer areas of the dish, to map the known pattern of the feed into a uniform illumination of the primary, to maximize the gain. However, this results in a secondary that is no longer precisely hyperbolic (though it is still very close), so the constant phase property is lost. [...] This phase error, however, can be compensated for by slightly tweaking the shape of the primary mirror. [...] The result is a higher gain, or gain/spillover ratio, at the cost of surfaces that are trickier to fabricate and test. [...] Other dish illumination patterns can also be synthesized, such as patterns with high taper at the dish edge for ultra-low spillover sidelobes, and patterns with a central [...] "hole" [...] to reduce feed shadowing.|$|E
2500|$|Based on {{the earlier}} Grumman XP-50 that was {{eventually}} canceled, the company developed the XP-65 (Model 51) further {{for a future}} [...] "convoy fighter" [...] concept. In 1943, work on the XP-65 was terminated {{in favor of the}} design that would eventually become the F7F. The contract for the prototype XF7F-1 was signed on 30 June 1941. Grumman's aim was to produce a fighter that outperformed and outgunned all existing fighter aircraft, and that had an auxiliary ground attack capability. Armament was heavy: four 20mm cannon and four 0.50 in (12.7mm) machine guns, as well as underwing and under-fuselage hardpoints for bombs and torpedoes. Performance met expectations too; the F7F Tigercat was one of <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>performance</b> piston-engined fighters, with a top speed well in excess of the US Navy's single-engined aircraft—71mph faster than a Grumman F6F Hellcat at sea level. CAPT Fred M. Trapnell, one of the Navy's premier test pilots, opined that: [...] "It's the best damn fighter I've ever flown." [...] The Grumman F7F was originally named the [...] "Tomcat" [...] but this name was rejected as it was considered too suggestive, at the time. The name would much later be used for the Grumman F-14.|$|E
