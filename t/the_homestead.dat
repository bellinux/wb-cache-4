2500|$|A community-owned store (the [...] "Trading Post") and cannery were {{established}} in 1934, but both struggled with inexperienced management. Wage-paying industries never relocated to <b>the</b> <b>Homesteads</b> as <b>the</b> government had hoped, and attempts by homesteaders to establish a coal mine and sorghum mill failed. Throughout <b>the</b> 1930s, <b>the</b> <b>Homesteads</b> project was overseen by a succession of agencies with differing philosophies, leaving the project without a clear purpose. By 1945, {{the federal government had}} extricated itself from <b>the</b> <b>Homesteads</b> project after allowing the remaining homesteaders to purchase their farms. Although the original purpose of <b>the</b> <b>Homesteads</b> project failed, <b>the</b> community survived, and over half the farms remained in the hands of original homesteaders through the 1950s.|$|R
2500|$|Buildings at Cumberland Homesteads were {{constructed}} using primarily a locally-quarried sandstone known as [...] "crab orchard" [...] stone, {{which is known}} for its durability and reddish hue in late afternoon sunlight. The most notable building in Cumberland <b>Homesteads</b> is <b>the</b> <b>Homesteads</b> Tower, a cross-shaped building centered around an eight-story octagonal water tower. This building originally housed <b>the</b> <b>Homesteads</b> offices, and is now home to <b>the</b> <b>Homesteads</b> Tower Museum. <b>The</b> elementary school and high school, located behind <b>the</b> <b>Homesteads</b> Tower, consist of unique pod-style designs, with detached classrooms and workshops connected by covered walkways.

5|$|In 1876, Wright {{was elected}} to his old seat in Congress as a Democrat, but {{with support from the}} small Greenback movement. In 1878, the {{situation}} was reversed: Wright ran as a Greenbacker, but was reelected with support by Democrats. He attracted attention in Congress with his proposal to amend <b>the</b> <b>Homestead</b> Act of 1862 to establish government loans to would-be settlers of the West, making it easier for landless Easterners to claim homesteads there. Congress was, on the whole, not receptive to Wright's proposal. Wright proposed it again in 1879 and emphasized the conservatism of his proposal, that it was a loan secured by <b>the</b> <b>homestead,</b> not a gift from the state; even so, the bill went down to overwhelming defeat. Despite his failure, Wright, like Weaver, had raised his profile as a potential presidential nominee by attempting to advance Greenback ideas in Congress.|$|E

40|$|An {{exploratory}} {{study of the}} traditional village forests of two different religious communities (Hindu and Muslim) in the Narsingdi fl oodplain area of Bangladesh was carried out {{over a period of}} fi ve months from January to June 2002. Green coverage, species diversity and species preferences of both communities were assessed and compared. The Hindu community had the highest green coverage of 71 % in <b>the</b> <b>homesteads,</b> 80 % in temple inside <b>the</b> <b>homesteads,</b> and 63 % in temple outside <b>the</b> <b>homesteads.</b> Whereas, <b>the</b> Muslim community had 63 % green coverage in <b>the</b> <b>homesteads,</b> 42 % in the graveyard, 60 % in the mosque and 50 % in the Madrasha campus. All economic strata of Hindu were reported to have the highest number of species in comparison to the respective category of Muslim. A total of 76 tree and 45 shrub species were recorded from <b>the</b> <b>homesteads</b> of <b>the</b> Hindu community while 59 tree and 27 shrub species were found in the Muslim community. In all respects, the Hindu community was found very rich in stock of tree and shrub species in contrast to the Muslim community. The sub-cultural activities of the Hindu were found very positive in homestead forest management and conservation of species. The threatened and rare species and individuals of trees and shrubs were found in greater number in <b>the</b> <b>homesteads</b> in <b>the</b> Hindu community than in the Muslim community. The present study has found some important Hindu-sub-cultural factors, which are very positive for <b>the</b> conservation of <b>homestead</b> forests in rural areas of the fl oodplain area of Bangladesh. The fi ndings may be used in the forestry and environmental planning in Bangladesh...|$|R

5|$|Johnson's first {{tenure in}} the Senate {{came to a}} {{conclusion}} in March 1862 when Lincoln appointed him military governor of Tennessee. Much of the central and western portions of that seceded state had been recovered. Although some argued that civil government should simply resume once the Confederates were defeated in an area, Lincoln chose to use his power {{as commander in chief}} to appoint military governors over Union-controlled Southern regions. The Senate quickly confirmed Johnson's nomination along with the rank of brigadier general. In response, the Confederates confiscated his land and his slaves, and turned his home into a military hospital. Later in 1862, after his departure from the Senate {{and in the absence of}} most Southern legislators, <b>the</b> <b>Homestead</b> Bill was finally enacted. Along with legislation for land-grant colleges and for the transcontinental railroad, <b>the</b> <b>Homestead</b> Bill has been credited with opening the American West to settlement.|$|E

5|$|Lincoln {{adhered to}} the Whig theory of the presidency, which gave Congress primary {{responsibility}} for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them. Lincoln vetoed only four bills passed by Congress; the only important one was the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction. He signed <b>the</b> <b>Homestead</b> Act in 1862, making {{millions of acres of}} government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' First Transcontinental Railroad, which was completed in 1869. The passage of <b>the</b> <b>Homestead</b> Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was made possible by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|The new senator {{took his}} seat when Congress convened in December 1857 (the term of his predecessor, James C. Jones, had expired in March). He came to Washington as usual without {{his wife and}} family; Eliza would visit Washington only once during Johnson's first time as senator, in 1860. Johnson {{immediately}} set about introducing <b>the</b> <b>Homestead</b> Bill in the Senate, but as most senators who supported it were Northern (many associated with the newly founded Republican Party), the matter became caught up in suspicions over the slavery issue. Southern senators felt that those who {{took advantage of the}} provisions of <b>the</b> <b>Homestead</b> Bill {{were more likely to be}} Northern non-slaveholders. The issue of slavery had been complicated by the Supreme Court's ruling earlier in the year in Dred Scott v. Sandford that slavery could not be prohibited in the territories. Johnson, a slaveholding senator from a Southern state, made a major speech in the Senate the following May in an attempt to convince his colleagues that <b>the</b> <b>Homestead</b> Bill and slavery were not incompatible. Nevertheless, Southern opposition was key to defeating the legislation, 30–22. In 1859, it failed on a procedural vote when Vice President Breckinridge broke a tie against the bill, and in 1860, a watered-down version passed both houses, only to be vetoed by Buchanan at the urging of Southerners. Johnson continued his opposition to spending, chairing a committee to control it.|$|E

5|$|In direct {{opposition}} to the immense productivity that she displayed in the early 1860s, Dickinson wrote fewer poems in 1866. Beset with personal loss as well as loss of domestic help, Dickinson {{may have been too}} overcome to keep up her previous level of writing. Carlo died during this time after providing sixteen years of companionship; Dickinson never owned another dog. Although the household servant of nine years, Margaret O Brien, had married and left <b>the</b> <b>Homestead</b> that same year, it was not until 1869 that her family brought in a permanent household servant, Margaret Maher, to replace the old one.
