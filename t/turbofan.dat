5|$|The Airbus A318 {{is a small}} commercial, narrow-body (single-aisle) {{aircraft}} with a retractable tricycle {{landing gear}} and is powered by two wing pylon-mounted <b>turbofan</b> engines. Two suppliers provide <b>turbofan</b> engines for the A318, CFM International with the CFM56-5B engine and Pratt & Whitney with the PW6000 engine. It is a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a conventional tail unit having a single vertical stabilizer and rudder.|$|E
5|$|Tu-142LL: Two {{converted}} earlier Tu-142s {{used for}} testing of <b>turbofan</b> engines. ASW equipment was removed.|$|E
5|$|Both Northrop and General Dynamics (GD) {{responded to}} the FX requirement. GD's F-16/79 was {{a variant of the}} F-16A, {{replacing}} the Pratt & Whitney F100 <b>turbofan</b> engine with the J79 turbojet and equipping it with downgraded avionics; Northrop responded with the F-5G.|$|E
5000|$|For {{reasons of}} fuel economy, {{and also of}} reduced noise, almost all of today's jet airliners are powered by {{high-bypass}} <b>turbofans.</b> Although modern combat aircraft tend to use low-bypass ratio <b>turbofans,</b> military transport aircraft (e.g., C-17 [...] ) mainly use high-bypass ratio <b>turbofans</b> (or turboprops) for fuel efficiency.|$|R
50|$|Most of the {{configurations}} {{discussed above}} {{are used in}} civilian <b>turbofans,</b> while modern military <b>turbofans</b> (e.g., SNECMA M88) are usually basic two-spool.|$|R
50|$|The low-specific-thrust/high-bypass-ratio <b>turbofans</b> used in today's civil jetliners (and some {{military}} transport aircraft) {{evolved from the}} high-specific-thrust/low-bypass-ratio <b>turbofans</b> used in such aircraft back in the 1960s.|$|R
5|$|During the A320 {{development}} programme, Airbus considered propfan technology, {{backed by}} Lufthansa. At the time unproven, it {{was essentially a}} fan placed outside the engine nacelle, offering speed of a <b>turbofan</b> at turboprops economics; eventually, Airbus stuck with turbofans.|$|E
5|$|The Airbus A320 {{family are}} narrow-body (single-aisle) {{aircraft}} with a retractable {{tricycle landing gear}} and are powered by two wing pylon-mounted <b>turbofan</b> engines. The Airbus A320 family is the only narrow-body aircraft from Airbus.|$|E
5|$|The {{suppliers}} provide <b>turbofan</b> engines for the A320 {{series are}} CFM International with the CFM56, International Aero Engines offering its V2500, and Pratt & Whitney's PW6000 engines available {{only for the}} A318.|$|E
50|$|Rolls-Royce Deutschland has {{inherited}} {{responsibility for}} the Tay, Spey and IAE V2500 two shaft <b>turbofans</b> and the Dart turboprop from the parent company, allowing the Derby site to concentrate on its three shaft civil <b>turbofans.</b>|$|R
50|$|Initial design {{proposals}} {{included a}} straight-wing airliner powered by two Soloviev D-30 <b>turbofans</b> and resembling an enlarged Yak-40, {{but this was}} rejected as it was considered uncompetitive compared to Western airliners powered by high bypass ratio <b>turbofans.</b> Yakovlev settled on a design powered by three of the new Lotarev D-36 three-shaft high-bypass <b>turbofans,</b> which were to provide 63.90 kN (14,330 lbf) of thrust. Unlike the Yak-40, the new airliner would have swept wings.|$|R
50|$|Low bypass <b>turbofans</b> {{have a lower}} exhaust speed than {{turbojets}} and {{are mostly}} used for high sonic and transonic and low supersonic speeds. High bypass <b>turbofans</b> are used for subsonic aircraft and are quite efficient and are widely used for airliners.|$|R
5|$|Vulcan B.1 XA896 was {{withdrawn}} from RAF service in June 1964 {{and transferred to}} be converted to the test bed for the Bristol Siddeley BS100 vectored thrust <b>turbofan</b> for the Hawker Siddeley P.1154. The P.1154 was cancelled in February 1965 and XA896 was scrapped before being converted.|$|E
5|$|A {{separate}} partnership {{was formed}} between Rolls-Royce and Turbomeca {{to develop the}} Adour afterburning <b>turbofan</b> engine. The Br.121 was proposed with Turbomeca's Tourmalet engine for ECAT but Breguet preferred the RR RB.172 and their joint venture would use elements of both. The new engine, which {{would be used for}} the AFVG as well, would be built in Derby and Tarnos.|$|E
5|$|Concorde {{needed to}} fly long {{distances}} to be economically viable; this required high efficiency from the powerplant. <b>Turbofan</b> engines were rejected {{due to their}} larger cross-section producing excessive drag. Olympus turbojet technology was available to be developed to meet the design requirements of the aircraft, although turbofans would be studied for any future SST.|$|E
5000|$|Xian H-7I - Follow-on of Xian H-6I, which {{replaced}} the Rolls-Royce Spey Mk 512 engines with four WS-6J (Type 910) <b>turbofans</b> to reduce operational cost and to simply logistics. A back-up design used six Pratt and Whitney JT3D <b>turbofans.</b> None built.|$|R
40|$|Five NASA engine-oriented {{propulsion}} {{programs of}} major importance to civil aviation are presented and discussed. Included are programs directed at exploring propulsion-system concepts for (1) energy-conservative subsonic aircraft (improved current <b>turbofans,</b> advanced <b>turbofans,</b> and advanced turboprops), (2) supersonic cruise aircraft (variable-cycle engines), (3) general aviation aircraft (improved reciprocating engines and small gas turbines), (4) powered-lift aircraft (advanced <b>turbofans),</b> and (5) advanced rotorcraft. These programs reflect the opportunities still existing for {{significant improvements in}} civil aviation {{through the application of}} advanced propulsion concept...|$|R
50|$|The lower {{fan speed}} allows higher bypass ratios, leading to reduced fuel {{consumption}} and much reduced noise. The Bae 146 is fitted with geared <b>turbofans</b> {{and is still}} one of the quietest commercial aircraft. A large part of the noise reduction is due to reduced fan tip speeds. In conventional <b>turbofans</b> the fan tips exceed the speed of sound causing a characteristic drone, requiring sound deadening. Geared <b>turbofans</b> operate the fan at sufficiently low rotational speed to avoid supersonic tip speeds.|$|R
5|$|The Pegasus <b>turbofan</b> jet engine, {{developed}} {{in tandem with}} the P.1127 then the Harrier, was designed specifically for V/STOL manoeuvring. Bristol Siddeley developed it from their earlier conventional Orpheus <b>turbofan</b> engine as the core with Olympus compressor blades for the fan. The engine's thrust is directed through the four rotatable nozzles. The engine is equipped for water injection to increase thrust and takeoff performance in hot and high altitude conditions; in normal V/STOL operations the system would be used in landing vertically with a heavy weapons load. The water injection function had originally been added following the input of US Air Force Colonel Bill Chapman, who worked for the Mutual Weapons Development Team. Water injection was necessary in order to generate maximum thrust, if only for a limited time, and was typically used during landing, especially in high ambient temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} airplane, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 (registration N1819U), {{was delivered}} in 1973 {{and had been}} owned by UAL since then. Before departure on the flight from Denver on July 19, 1989, the airplane had been operated {{for a total of}} 43,401 hours and 16,997 cycles. The airplane was powered by General Electric Aircraft Engines (GEAE) CF6-6D high bypass ratio <b>turbofan</b> engines.|$|E
5|$|After having {{positioned}} {{to perform a}} visual inspection, the robot performs an acquisition with a pan-tilt-zoom camera. Several steps take place: pointing the camera, sensing the element to be inspected, if needed repointing and zooming with the camera, image acquisition and inspection. Image analysis is used on doors {{to determine whether they}} are open or closed; on {{the presence or absence of}} protection for certain equipment; the state of <b>turbofan</b> blades or the wear of landing gear tires.|$|E
500|$|The first {{prototype}} VX770 had its Sapphire engines {{replaced with}} four [...] Rolls-Royce Conway RCo.7 <b>turbofans</b> in 1957. It {{was transferred to}} Rolls-Royce as the Conway test bed. It flew with the Conways, the first <b>turbofans</b> in the world, until its fatal crash in September 1958.|$|R
5000|$|The DGEN program aims at {{developing}} {{a family of}} high-bypass-ratio two-spool unmixed-flow jet engines (<b>turbofans)</b> - the DGEN 380 and 390 - intended to equip 4- to 6-seat aircraft in a twin-engine configuration with a maximum take-off weight (MTOW) between 1400 and 2150 kg. The DGEN engines are recognized as being the only <b>turbofans</b> designed for the flight envelope of the general aviation (altitude under 25,000 ft, speed under Mach 0,35). The DGEN engines have an architecture typical of the civil aviation's <b>turbofans</b> and integrate innovations such as a geared fan and an [...] "all-electric" [...] concept.|$|R
50|$|Dry {{specific}} thrust has {{impact upon the}} performance of afterburning <b>turbofans.</b>|$|R
5|$|As of June 2016, as {{the most}} used high bypass <b>turbofan,</b> it {{achieved}} more than 800million engine flight hours, and {{at a rate of}} one million flight hours every eight days it will achieve one billion flight hours by 2020. It has more than 550 operators and more than 2,400 CFM56-powered jet aircraft are in the air at any moment. It is known for its dependability: its average time on wing is 30,000 hours before a first shop visit, with the current fleet record at 50,000 hours.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Pratt & Whitney {{dominated}} the commercial market. GE needed an engine {{in this market}} class, and SNECMA had previous experience of working with them, collaborating on {{the production of the}} CF6-50 <b>turbofan</b> for the Airbus A300. Pratt & Whitney was considering upgrading their JT8D to compete in the same class as the CFM56 as a sole venture, while Rolls-Royce dealt with financial issues that precluded them from starting new projects; this situation caused GE to gain the title of best partner for the program.|$|E
5|$|For the {{avionics}} {{and weapons}} qualification {{phase of the}} flight testing, PT-04 was fitted with a fourth-generation avionics suite that incorporates sensor fusion, an electronic warfare suite, enhanced man-machine interface, Digital Electronic Engine Control (DEEC) for the RD-93 <b>turbofan</b> engine, FBW flight controls, day/night precision surface attack capability, and multi-mode, pulse-Doppler radar for BVR air-to-air attack capability. The sixth prototype, PT-06, made its maiden flight on 10 September 2006. Following a competition in 2008, Martin-Baker was selected over a Chinese firm for the supply of fifty PK16LE ejection seats.|$|E
5000|$|Two Garrett TFE371-3A <b>turbofans,</b> the nacelles, and the {{propulsion}} support system.|$|R
50|$|Work on the Yak-77 {{began in}} 1992, the project manager being S A Yakovlev. The {{aircraft}} {{was to have}} two AE 3010/12 <b>turbofans,</b> uprated members of the Allison 3000 family of two-shaft <b>turbofans,</b> each with a takeoff rating of 4,500 kg (9,920 lb). Avionics were {{to have been a}} Collins Pro Line 4 system.|$|R
25|$|Avro 771– {{proposed}} 60-seat airliner {{powered by}} two Bristol Siddeley BS.75 <b>turbofans.</b>|$|R
5|$|In October 1995, Pakistan was {{reportedly}} {{to select a}} Western company {{by the end of}} the year to provide and integrate the FC-1's avionics, which was expected to go into production by 1999. The avionics were said to include radar, Inertial navigation system, Head-up display, and Multi-function displays. Competing bids came from Thomson-CSF with a variant of the Radar Doppler Multitarget (RDY), SAGEM with a similar avionics package to those used in the ROSE upgrade project, and Marconi Electronic Systems with its Blue Hawk radar. FIAR's (now SELEX Galileo) Grifo S7 radar was expected to be selected due to the company's ties with the PAF. In February 1998, Pakistan and China signed a letter of intent covering airframe development. Russia's Klimov offered a variant of the RD-33 <b>turbofan</b> engine to power the fighter. In April 1999, South Africa's Denel offered to arm the Super 7 with the T-darter beyond-visual-range (BVR) air-to-air missile (AAM), rather than the previously reported R-Darter. Previously in 1987, Pratt & Whitney offered the Super-7 project three engine options; PW1212, F404, and PW1216, with local manufacturing in either China or Pakistan. Rolls Royce offered its RB199-127/128 <b>turbofan</b> engine; this plan was scrapped in 1989.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} Airbus began {{development}} of the A300B9, a larger derivative of the A300, which would eventually become the A330. The B9 was essentially a lengthened A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful <b>turbofan</b> engines available. It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes. Offering the same range and payload as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 but with 25 per cent more fuel efficiency, the B9 {{was seen as a}} viable replacement for the DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar trijets. It was also considered as a medium-ranged successor to the A300.|$|E
5|$|It was {{powered by}} two <b>turbofan</b> engines with each in a {{separate}} engine nacelle with S-ducts, to shield engine axial compressors from radar waves, {{on either side of}} the aircraft's spine. Of the two aircraft built, the first YF-23 (PAV-1) was fitted with Pratt & Whitney YF119 engines, while the second (PAV-2) was powered by General Electric YF120 engines. The aircraft featured fixed engine nozzles, instead of thrust vectoring nozzles as on the YF-22. As on the B-2, the exhaust from the YF-23's engines flowed through troughs lined with heat-ablating tiles to dissipate heat and shield the engines from infrared homing (IR) missile detection from below.|$|E

50|$|The J79 was {{replaced}} by the late 1960s in new fighter designs by afterburning <b>turbofans</b> such as the Pratt & Whitney TF30 used in the F-111 and F-14, and newer generation <b>turbofans</b> with the Pratt & Whitney F100 used in the F-15 Eagle which give better cruise fuel efficiency by-passing air around the core of the engine.|$|R
40|$|The near-term {{technology}} improvements {{which can}} reduce the fuel consumed in the JT 9 D, JT 8 D, and JT 3 D <b>turbofans</b> in commercial fleet operation through the 1980 's are identified. Projected technology advances are identified and evaluated for new <b>turbofans</b> to be developed after 1985. Programs are recommended for developing the necessary technology...|$|R
