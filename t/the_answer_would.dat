5|$|In an {{interview}} by Scholastic with Rick Riordan for The Lost Hero, Riordan was questioned about {{the whereabouts of}} Percy Jackson. The author hinted that <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> be revealed as Jason's quest progressed. By {{the end of the}} book, he said that readers would have a good idea where the second book is going. On May 26, 2011, Riordan released both the cover art and the first chapter for The Son of Neptune confirming that Percy would {{play a role in the}} book.|$|E
25|$|It is {{uncertain}} whether Kiya ever used the rich funerary equipment that was prepared against her death. If her disappearance resulted from disgrace or exile, <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> be no. On the other hand, if {{she died in}} good standing with Akhenaten, she probably would have received a lavish burial appropriate to her station. In the latter case, a likely site for her interment would be the Amarna Royal Tomb, which includes a suite of three chambers evidently used to house female members of Akhenaten's family. At least two and possibly {{as many as three}} different individuals were interred in this suite, including Akhenaten's daughter Meketaten, the only one whose name survives. Two of the chambers originally included painted plaster reliefs depicting Akhenaten, Nefertiti, certain of their daughters, and other mourners lamenting the deceased. Some Egyptologists have suggested that one of these scenes of mourning refers to Kiya, although no specific evidence supports this claim.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} team depicted {{reality in}} the world of Never 7 as subjective and relative rather than absolute. As such, for each route, that route's history is the only one Makoto knows and the only one that is real to him; the Curé syndrome only exists to him in the routes where it is mentioned. The bells were used as symbols for reality being relative, and were described by the development team as [...] "vague existences", saying that one cannot know if they exist or not. In the bad ending to Izumi's route, the bells, which [...] "should be fictional" [...] remain while something that should exist disappears; this was a metaphor for the idea that delusions become reality while reality becomes a delusion. The game's title comes from how Makoto is unable to escape the infinite loop and reach April 7, and how most of the seven characters die {{at some point during the}} game. It is also based on the belief that 7 is a lucky number. The game was designed to be open to speculation and multiple interpretations, a design philosophy that was carried over to later entries in the series and was part of what led to Infinity being chosen as the series title. One example of the openness to interpretation was that development team did not want to confirm or deny whether the game's world was connected to that of the Memories Off series, saying that while characters with similar names may appear, they wanted to leave the player to decide for themselves what <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> be.|$|E

40|$|Our {{question}} answering system was built {{with a number}} of priorities in mind.

2500|$|Michael Thomson, {{writing for}} the BBC, lauded the film and the passion of {{director}} Marco Bechis, and wrote, [...] "It is director Marco Bechis' softly-softly approach which fills each frame with real power and leaves you in no doubt as to his commitment and passion. It is indeed no surprise to learn that this Italian-Chilean was himself snatched by the military in Buenos Aires and tortured. Yet, despite his admirable insistence on moving us with the truth (helped by his grainy camera work), Bechis can also tell a tale and he gradually incorporates a race-against-time element. Will Maria escape, especially when she is taken {{out on the town}} by her captor? Let's just say that <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> be alien to Hollywood." ...|$|E
2500|$|Descartes {{separates}} external objects {{into those}} that are clear and distinct and {{those that are}} confused and obscure. [...] The former group consists of the ideas of extension, duration and movement. These geometrical ideas cannot be misconstrued or combined {{in a way that makes}} them false. [...] For example, if the idea of a creature with the head of a giraffe, the body of a lion and tail of a beaver was constructed and the question asked if the creature had a large intestine, <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> have to be invented. But, no mathematical re-arrangement of a triangle could allow its three internal angles to sum to anything but 180 degrees. Thus, Descartes perceived that truths may have a nature or essence of themselves, independent of the thinker. (In Descartes' formulation, this is a mathematical truth only pragmatically related to nature; the properties of triangles in Euclidean geometry remain mathematically certain) ...|$|E
5000|$|Garagiola read a {{statement}} (e.g., [...] "How he shows affection"), and each contestant {{would have to}} raise his hand. The first three to raise their hands would say a one- or two-word <b>answer,</b> which Garagiola <b>would</b> ask them to explain. <b>The</b> <b>answers</b> <b>would</b> then be read {{one at a time}} over the phone, and the off-stage partner would have to ring in if she thought her partner had said it. If the first person to ring in was correct, the couple won 25 points. If she was wrong, the couple lost 10 points, as did the team which originally gave <b>the</b> <b>answer.</b> Each of <b>the</b> three <b>answers</b> <b>would</b> be read in random order. During the all-celebrity format, the off-stage partner would have to not only ring in for <b>the</b> correct <b>answer,</b> but also relate the same explanation or story about <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> as <b>the</b> on-stage partner to get the points; otherwise they lost 10 points.|$|R

When the wheel was in motion, teams needed to grab four ribbons with math equations surrounding the net's frame. The equations and/or <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> <b>would</b> be relayed to their teammate {{who was in the}} next capsule on the Ferris Wheel. Two of <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> to those math equations were the codes needed to unlock a briefcase containing their next clue.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "recruit to dilute" [...] fraud {{allegations}} were heard {{in court in}} 2000 in the case Sir William Jaffray & Ors v. The Society of Lloyd's and the appeal was heard in 2002. On each occasion the allegation {{that there had been}} a policy of [...] "recruit to dilute" [...] was rejected; however, at first instance the judge described the Names as [...] "the innocent victims [...] of staggering incompetence" [...] and at appeal the court found that representations that Lloyd's had a rigorous auditing system were false ( [...] the answer to the question [...] whether there was in existence a rigorous system of auditing which involved the making of a reasonable estimate of outstanding liabilities, including unknown and unnoted losses, is no. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> be no even if the word 'rigorous' were removed) and strongly hinted that one of Lloyd's main witnesses, Murray Lawrence, a previous chairman, had lied in his testimony ( [...] We have serious reservations about the veracity of Mr. Lawrence's evidence [...]).|$|E

30|$|Bottom line, the INSPIRE Coverage Core can be {{mapped to}} CIS, {{actually}} to all versions: In CIS 1.0, the corresponding type is RectifiedGridCoverage, in CIS 1.1 type GeneralGridCoverage {{would be used}} with all-regular axes.
