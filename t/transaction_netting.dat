50|$|If {{the same}} {{property}} had been burdened by recourse debt, and, as above, that property were foreclosed upon in full {{satisfaction of the}} debt, you would get a different result. The gain or loss would be determined {{with reference to the}} fair market value of the property, and the difference between the fair market value and the debt would be COD. (This intuitively makes sense because with recourse debt, any cancellation of the outstanding balance of the debt, after it has been satisfied to the extent of the FMV of the property given up, really is a termination of personal liability to pay that amount, unlike in a situation where the debt is nonrecourse). If the property has a value lower than its basis, then in the case of recourse debt you could get a capital loss and COD ordinary income on the same <b>transaction,</b> <b>netting</b> to the same dollar figure as with nonrecourse debt but potentially much worse for the taxpayer: The taxpayer would not only be burdened with ordinary rather than potentially capital gains, but may have more total income to report, offset only by a capital loss that would be unusable (except to a nominal extent in the case of individuals) if the taxpayer had no other capital transactions for the year. Only {{in the case of a}} taxpayer able to utilize one of the COD exclusions, such as insolvency, could this result be better.|$|E

40|$|Business {{collaboration}} is about coordinating {{the flow of}} information among organizations and linking their business processes into a cohesive whole. Collaborative business processes are time critical within and across organizations and can become unreliable due to temporal inconsistency where processes cannot execute according to the agreed temporal policies. It is necessary to have a mechanism to manage temporal consistency in service-oriented business collaboration. In this paper, we propose a model named Timed Choreographical Business <b>Transaction</b> <b>Net</b> (TiCoBTx-Net) based on Hierarchical Colored Petri Net for individual business participants to specify and manage the temporal consistency in business collaboration. A series of temporal polices are formalized and checked in TiCoBTx-Net to enforce the temporal consistency at design time and runtime. A verification mechanism is also developed to clarify the status of temporal inconsistencies. Finally, the implementation details of the proposed mechanism is provided. 13 page(s...|$|R

P 2 P networks are loosely coupled system without central control where peers have more autonomy. Therefore transaction management is crucial to applications such as e-commerce, process support systems etc. This study intends to utilize more semantics of application in transaction management for P 2 P environment. A transaction description model based on Colored Petri Net (CPN) is proposed. In this model, a transaction is composed of subtransactions that have been put together as building blocks according to the semantics of application. And transaction is denoted as a CPN, <b>Transaction</b> <b>Net</b> (TN) that is the combination of some sub-nets and the sub-nets are TNs of its subtransactions. Operators to construct a transaction from known ones as subtransactions, including sequence, concurrency, iteration and alternative are defined formally.

Properties of the model are analyzed. Algorithm to execute a compound transaction is presented also...|$|R

Abstract: This research provides a description of the process followed in order to assemble a “Social Accounting Matrix ” for Spain corresponding to the year 2000 (SAMSP 00). As argued in the paper, this process attempts to reconcile ESA 95 conventions with requirements of applied general equilibrium modelling. Particularly, problems related to the level of aggregation of net taxation data, and to the valuation system used for expressing the monetary value of input-output transactions have deserved special attention. Since the adoption of ESA 95 conventions, input-output transactions have been preferably valued at basic prices, which impose additional difficulties on modellers interested in computing applied general equilibrium models. This paper addresses these difficulties by developing a procedure that allows SAM-builders to change the valuation system of input-output transactions conveniently. In addition, this procedure produces new data related to net taxation information.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel {{explanation of the}} decision by a firm to make an input within the firm rather than to out-source the production to another firm. Due to the limited attention of the manager/entrepreneur, time spent overseeing production in-house has an opportunity cost: the neglect of potential new products/markets. Outsourcing production economizes on attention, but writing and negotiating contracts also has an opportunity cost: the neglect of current operations. This paper derives the endogenous transaction costs of writing a contract with another party and shows that positive transaction costs are not sufficient for the optimal internalization of <b>transactions.</b> However, positive <b>net</b> <b>transaction</b> costs results in the optimal decision to produce the input internally. In addition, although there are larger firm sizes of higher value than obtainable under the optimal policy, the optimal policy maximizes the social value of each individual transaction. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper extends options-based {{mortgage}} default {{theory to}} include transaction costs. When transaction costs are considered, the rational borrower will default {{only when the}} value of the collateral falls below the mortage value by an amount equal to the <b>net</b> <b>transaction</b> costs. Since, for most borrowers, <b>net</b> <b>transaction</b> costs are positive, standard measures of equity may be significantly negative by the time the rational borrower exercises the default option. This research shows theoretically and empirically the effects of frictions on the individual strike price. The addition of transaction costs to the theory provides several testable implications for equity loss severity. First, the longer the foreclosure process and the period of free rent to the borrower, the lower the severity. Second, severity will be smaller when bankruptcy has been declared. Third, severity is decreasing in the contract decreasing function of the probability of a deficiency judgment. The empirical results, using servicing and foreclosure data from a large northeastern thrift, support the theoretical model. ...|$|R

External and internal factors can affect the stability of the financial system of a country. To find the integration of world capital markets and Indonesian financial system stability due to the global financial crisis, this study was conducted in two periods, they are the period of global financial crisis (July 2007 -December 2010) and the period after global financial crisis (January 2011 - December 2013). This study used a quantitative approach using the Johansen Cointegration Test. Monthly data were analyzed using the method of Ordinary Least Square (OLS). The result of this study showed that there is no cointegration between Jakarta Composite Index and S&P 500 in the period of crisis and recovery. It means there is short term relationship. This prove showed that there is integration between Jakarta Composite Index and S&P 500. When there is collapse in S&P 500, so did the Indonesia stock market.
