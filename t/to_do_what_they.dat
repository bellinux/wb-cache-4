5|$|Humanity survives in the aftermath, but {{the world}} {{experiences}} an ice age outside of Kazamatsuri. In the city, a huge tree grows 500 meters tall in three years, which contains the orb of light from Kotarou and Kagari. The five heroines, now in high school, investigate the tree {{as members of the}} occult research society and transform Kotarou into a familiar, but he refuses <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> demand. Kotarou takes the girls to the Moon where they are shown circled around a seedling (as the embodiment of the Moon's Kagari) sprouting on the otherwise barren regolith.|$|E

25|$|Some birds seem to {{lack the}} {{perception}} of grief or quickly accept it- for example, Mallard hens, although shocked for a moment when losing one of their young to a predator, will soon return <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were <b>doing</b> before the predator attacked. However, some other waterbirds, such as Mute swans, are known to grieve {{for the loss of}} a partner or cygnet, and are known to engage in pining for days, weeks or even months at a time.|$|R

25|$|Despite Piye's {{successful}} campaign {{into the}} Delta, his authority only extended northward from Thebes {{up to the}} western desert oases and Herakleopolis where Peftjauawybast ruled as a Nubian vassal king. The local kings of Lower Egypt—especially Tefnakht—were essentially free <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted without Piye's oversight. It was Shabaka, Piye's successor, who later rectified this unsatisfactory situation by attacking Sais and defeating Tefnakht's successor Bakenranef there, in his second regnal year.|$|E
25|$|In {{that same}} year 1990, {{together}} with Anatoly Kalashnikov, Brusilovsky got a private commission to paint eleven canvasses, sized 1.5 х 2 m, {{in the style of}} interior painting.

He refused to collect the canvasses, and gave the artists permission <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted with the paintings.

25|$|The island governments, {{headed by}} their bailiffs, Victor Carey in Guernsey and Alexander Coutanche in Jersey, {{had been ordered}} by the British Government to remain on their islands to {{maintain}} law and order and <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> could for the civilians. This put them under a duty of care. When the lieutenant governors, who were the King's representatives on each island, departed on 21 June 1940, their powers and duties were vested in the bailiffs, namely to protect the islands and their population, taking on {{the duties of the}} Lieutenant Governors added a further duty of care.|$|E
25|$|The {{plantation}} produced oranges, {{sea island}} cotton, indigo, okra, and other vegetables. Approximately 60 slaves were managed under the task system: each slave had a quota {{of work to}} do per day. When they were finished, they were allowed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wished. Some slaves had personal gardens which they were allowed to cultivate, and from which they sold vegetables. Thirty-two cabins were constructed for and by the slaves, made from tabby, which made them durable, insulated, and inexpensive although labor-intensive. The cabins were located {{about a quarter of a}} mile (400 m) from the main house. Slaves were allowed to padlock their cabins and build porches that faced away from the main house. Both of these features were unusual for slave quarters in antebellum America.|$|E
25|$|Their concept artists {{looked to}} the team's {{favorite}} graphic novels for inspiration and the concept artwork by Ralph McQuarrie, Doug Chiang, Joe Johnston, and others {{who worked on the}} Star Wars films. They were given access to the Episode II script and concept art early on before the film came out. LucasArts created storyboarded scripts of their cutscenes and gave them to ILM, who developed them into cinematic cutscenes. Knoles envisioned the level layouts and then consulted with lead level designer David Wehr and his level designers. They created a bubble map of the levels which they worked from to determine details in what the player would face and be able to do. The team made a new engine for the game to be able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted. The graphic designers worked concurrently with the level designers to create the environments, which the level designers then used to better visualize what they were trying to do. Knoles had previously been involved {{in the development of the}} Super Star Wars trilogy for the Super Nintendo and often referred to those games when describing certain aspects of Star Wars: Bounty Hunter to the team.|$|E

25|$|A {{more serious}} {{incident}} took place when {{the region of}} Sfax in Tunisia rose in revolt against French intervention. The revolt was started by a local artillery commander, who was called upon to produce his troops {{in support of the}} French, but in fact despite receiving pay for the men, had none. To divert attention, he organised a local demonstration against the French. This led to other foreign nationals fleeing the region, although it was only the French who were affected. Local Bedawin then took up the revolt which grew out of control, although order and respect for foreign property in the town was maintained by a local leader, Camoum. The French sent ships and then a fleet to bombard the town, and eventually troops which landed to occupy it on 16 July. After order was restored, the French set up a commission of enquiry to investigate claims for damages and invited the British and Italians each to appoint a representative. Tryon was chosen to represent the British on the commission which first met 29 August. The Commission sat for six weeks, by which time the evidence submitted already indicated strongly that damage to property and looting had been carried out by the French troops, at which point the commission was suddenly dissolved. The British official position was one of neutrality, and in effect allowing the French <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted. This placed Tryon in a delicate position that while he confirmed the views of locals that the French had caused much of the problems and intended {{to take control of the}} region, Britain would do nothing to intervene. He was instructed to send reports directly to the Admiralty and foreign office, rather than to his commander, Admiral Seymour. Monarch spent much of a six-month period at anchor off Tunisia in temperatures of 80-90 degrees Fahrenheit, without any leave being permitted, which made the task an uncomfortable one for all concerned. Although the warship was not required, the Foreign office specifically requested that Tryon should remain for as long as possible. Tryon was commended for his handling of the affair by Earl Granville from the foreign office, the Lords of the Admiralty, and by the French Government.|$|E
