5|$|Attendance was low, in {{part due}} to Tech fans' {{reluctance}} to travel across the country and pay high prices for the chance to do so. Travel agents indicated low business in {{the weeks leading up to}} the game, and Tech sold approximately 5,000tickets—a far lower total than the Hokies' two previous bowl games, when 25,000tickets each were sold <b>to</b> <b>games</b> in Florida and Louisiana.|$|E

5|$|Criticism {{focused on}} {{particular}} {{aspects of the}} game. Miller considered the inability to save progress a drawback since gamers will {{have to play the}} entire game in one sitting if they wish to complete it. Rignall described the audio and visuals as being outdated in comparison <b>to</b> <b>games</b> on the Mega Drive and Super NES (the latter platform having already been launched in other regions by the time Super Mario Bros. 3 was released in Europe).|$|E
5|$|Daniel Tack for Game Informer {{rated the}} game with an 8/10, {{comparing}} it <b>to</b> <b>games</b> such as Dwarf Fortress and Towns, but more accessible and with improved graphics. IGN 's Rowan Kaiser awarded an 8.3/10 score, noting that Banished suffered when the gameplay difficulty was lower, while also making the same comparison to Dwarf Fortress as Game Informer. Kaiser praised Banished for creating difficulty through {{the lack of a}} money resource, rather than using money as the primary source of difficulty.|$|E
5|$|Metroid Prime Hunters {{features}} a multiplayer mode that supports {{up to four}} players and includes voice chat capability. In it, the player is able to control Samus or one of six other bounty hunters featured in the single-player mode. Each bounty hunter has a unique alternative form, such as Samus's Morph Ball, and a special weapon. The game host can set options for point and time limits, and restrict the use of radar. Computer-controlled players of varying skill levels can be added <b>to</b> <b>games</b> if the minimum of four players is not met.|$|E

5|$|The Games column lists {{regular season}} totals and {{excludes}} post-season play. Although all teams {{are scheduled for}} {{the same number of}} games each season, variance in the number from year to year is possible due <b>to</b> <b>games</b> that are cancelled or postponed and not played later in the season, or due to tie-breakers played {{at the end of the}} season to determine playoff eligibility or seeding.|$|E

Although he only saw Gaddafi at one game, he met Gaddafi's sons Al-Saadi and Mutassim and {{considered}} following their footsteps into the oil business. In his first few weeks in Benghazi, he witnessed several protests against Gaddafi but relatively little violence. In addition, he saw people, including his teammates, gathering ammunition and weapons to prepare for the revolution.|$|E
5|$|After version 1.0 {{had been}} finished, the engine's code name White Engine {{was changed to}} the {{official}} title Crystal Tools. This was not only done to represent {{the company and its}} works better, but also due to the refractive effects of real-life crystals that were meant to symbolize the flexibility of the engine. Over the next few months, the programmers advanced the engine to version 1.1 and added preliminary support for the Wii. In September 2011, Final Fantasy Versus XIII director Tetsuya Nomura announced that his team had replaced Crystal Tools with a proprietary action game engine that was supplemented by the lighting technology of the company's new Luminous Studio engine. Other teams, such as the staff behind Final Fantasy XIII-2, kept using and refining Crystal Tools. For , the engine was adjusted to make it more suitable <b>to</b> <b>games</b> with an open world design.|$|E

5|$|Developers {{are able}} to request Steam keys of their {{products}} to use as they see fit, such as to give away in promotions, to provide to selected users for review, or to give to key resellers for different profitization. Valve generally honors all such requests, but clarified that they would evaluate some requests to avoid giving keys <b>to</b> <b>games</b> or other offerings {{that are designed to}} manipulate the Steam storefront and other features. For example, Valve said that a request for 500,000 keys for a game that has significantly negative reviews and 1,000 sales on Steam is unlikely to be granted.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{up through}} 2012, Valve would {{manually}} select games {{to be included}} on the Steam service, generally limiting these <b>to</b> <b>games</b> that either had a major developer supporting them, or smaller studios with proven track records for Valve's purposes. Valve have sought ways to enable more games to be offered through Steam, while pulling away from manually approving games for the service, short of validating that a game runs on the platforms the publisher had indicated. Alden Kroll, {{a member of the}} Steam development team, said that Valve knows Steam is in a near-monopoly for game sales on personal computers, and the company {{does not want to be}} in a position to determine what gets sold, and thus had tried to find ways to make the process of adding games to Steam outside of their control. At the same time, Valve recognized that unfettered control of games onto the service can lead to discovery problems as well as low-quality games that are put onto the service for a cash grab.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} create an RPG that would appeal to a wide {{audience}} unfamiliar with the genre, and video games in general, Horii {{wanted to create a}} new kind of RPG that did not rely on previous experience with the Dungeons & Dragons tabletop RPG, did not require hundreds of hours of rote fighting, and could appeal to any kind of gamer. To accomplish this he needed to simplify the system and have players associate themselves with the hero. Thus as the game progressed, the hero would become stronger, in contrast <b>to</b> <b>games</b> like Super Mario Bros. where the character Mario did not become progressively more powerful during the game. He wanted to build on Portopia and place a greater emphasis on storytelling and emotional involvement. He developed a coming-of-age tale that audiences could relate to and made use of RPG level-building gameplay as a way to represent this.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, a {{minority}} of the club's supporters had {{a reputation as one of}} Britain's most prominent casuals groups, the Aberdeen Soccer Casuals. The rise of the Aberdeen Casuals coincided with the most successful period in the club's history, and has been chronicled in more than one published account. Whilst numbers have steadily declined with the introduction of Football Banning Orders preventing hooligans from travelling <b>to</b> <b>games,</b> the Aberdeen Casuals still appear at big fixtures often away from home and in the UEFA Europa League. There were clashes at both fixtures against FC Groningen in 2014, as well as 13 arrests after violent clashes with Dundee United fans at a game in December 2015.|$|E
5|$|Mara {{replaced}} Gibson as the team's president {{before the}} 1927 season. He told March to spend whatever he felt necessary {{to build a}} championship caliber team. March overhauled the roster and the team finished 11–1–1, while winning its first NFL championship. They barely broke even financially however, and the team was still giving away as many as 4,000 tickets a game. Mara decided to reduce costs the following season, and instead of traveling first class, the Giants drove <b>to</b> <b>games</b> in a used bus, and stayed at local YMCAs instead of hotels. The team had to push the bus once for several miles when it broke down, and players had trouble sleeping at the Y. They won only four games, and Mara lost $40,000.|$|E
