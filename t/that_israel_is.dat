25|$|A {{review in}} Al-Modon said <b>that</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>is</b> empty {{as the book}} is empty, that the book is part of {{continuing}} Zionist methodology of claiming that Palestine is a land without a people, the same methodology that led the Zionists to steal the Palestinian cuisine and claim world-wide that hummus and falafel are Israeli inventions.|$|E
2500|$|While both experts {{concluded}} <b>that</b> <b>Israel</b> might <b>be</b> {{making such}} single-stage boosted bombs, Vanunu, whose work experience {{was limited to}} material (not component) production, gave no specific evidence <b>that</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>was</b> making two-stage thermonuclear bombs, such as neutron bombs.|$|R

25|$|Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman also corroborated claims <b>that</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>is</b> {{interested}} in forging closer relations with Latvia as Rinkevics emphasized the 20th anniversary {{of relations between}} Latvia and Israel in 2012 and both foreign ministers expressed their commitment to strengthening economic and trade cooperation, including contacts between Latvian and Israeli entrepreneurs and a more cooperative operation {{in the fields of}} education, culture and science.|$|E
25|$|In {{both the}} House and Senate {{versions}} the bill declares <b>that</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>is</b> a major strategic {{partner of the}} United States. It amends the Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation Act of 2012 to extend authority to add to foreign-based defense stockpiles and transfer obsolete or surplus United States Department of Defense items to Israel. It authorizes the United States President to carry out US-Israel cooperative activities, including {{in the fields of}} energy, water, homeland security, cyber-security, agriculture, and alternative fuel technologies, as well as renewable energy or energy efficiency. It also urges the President to provide assistance for enhancement of rocket defense systems.|$|E
25|$|In {{a bid to}} {{maintain}} Israel's technological gap ahead of Arab states, the F-35 deal was pushed through instead of upgrading the air force's F-15s and F-16s. This approach sticks to the principle <b>that</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>is</b> the first country in the Middle East to receive the newest fighter aircraft. The IAF was sufficiently committed to this principle to override protests from the leaders of Israeli defense contractors, who claimed that the deal was damaging them. The package also got by opposition {{from a number of}} members of the General Staff who criticized the high price of the deal, which does not allow for investment into weapons for the land forces and navy.|$|E
5000|$|Mordechai Nisan, like Haddad, {{notes that}} it made waves, {{stirring}} both curiosity and wrath, the latter since it fed into regional suspicions <b>that</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>was</b> intent on [...] "balkanizing" [...] the neighbourhood. Nisan thought the regional outcry both exaggerated and incredulous: Yinon's apparent suggestion <b>that</b> <b>Israel</b> adopt an interventionist role to abet the fragmentation of Arab states the author thought inevitable, he added, served to create an impression <b>that</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>was</b> engaged in a sinister plot, when the views expressed were Yinon's alone, and did not represent Israeli government policy.|$|R

25|$|The Cypriot media {{report that}} the country could receive natural gas from Israel in early 2015, at reduced prices, if discussions on the supply of small {{quantities}} are completed {{by the end of}} the year, as the Minister of Commerce, Industry and Tourism Neoklis Sylikiotis has announced in a press conference about a visit to Israel by a high-ranking Cypriot delegation. The Cypriot government is seeking an interim energy solution until its own natural gas reserves can be developed. Minister Sylikiotis said <b>that</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>is</b> positive in supplying Cyprus a small quantity of natural gas, 0.5-0.7 billion cubic meters, for electricity production. He added that Cyprus would import Israeli gas in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG) through contracts between Electricity Authority of Cyprus and Israel Electric Corporation (IEC).|$|E
25|$|Relations between Cyprus and Israel {{have been}} {{excessively}} strong, thus many Cypriots and Israelis usually {{refer to it}} as Cypriot-Israeli brotherhood and consider the other nation an ally and a brother-nation. Cyprus and Israel consider each other as being the only two democracies in the Eastern Mediterranean, leading the leader of Democratic Rally Averof Neofytou in September 2013 to support <b>that</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>is</b> Cyprus most reliable partner. President of Israel Shimon Peres has claimed that Cyprus is Israel's most predictable neighbour. As a sign of the emotional bonding between Israel and Cyprus there has been a high level of exchange of representation for various events in both countries such as the representation of the Israeli government at the funeral of Cypriot fourth President Glafcos Clerides by the Israeli Minister of Tourism Uzi Landau in November 2013 and the visit of the Cypriot Minister of Defence Fotis Fotiou to the funeral of ex-Prime Minister of Israel Ariel Sharon.|$|E
25|$|Israeli {{official}} sources, foreign press, {{and officials}} {{present at the}} time, and historians such as Joseph Schechtman have long claimed that the 1948 refugee crisis was instigated by the invading Arab armies, who ordered Palestinian civilians to evacuate the battle zone, {{in order to allow}} the Arab armies freedom to operate. Opponents of the right of return, such as Efraim Karsh say <b>that</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>is</b> therefore not obligated to compensate Palestinians or allow them to return. Israel officially denies any responsibility for the Palestinian exodus, stating that their flight was caused by the Arab invasion. According to some sources, including Arab ones, Palestinian flight from Israel was not compelled but was predominantly voluntary, as a result of seven Arab nations declaring war on Israel in 1948. Many Arab leaders encouraged and even ordered Palestinians to evacuate the battle zone {{in order to make it}} easier for the Arab armies and fedayeen to demolish the newly found Jewish state and Israel officially denies any responsibility for the Palestinian exodus, stating that their flight was caused by the Arab invasion. Karsh states that most Palestinians chose their status as refugees themselves, and therefore Israel is therefore absolved of responsibility.|$|E

5000|$|Less than {{a quarter}} of an hour after the broadcast, radio {{programs}} from all over the world began announcing <b>that</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>was</b> mobilizing its army. Urgent messages were sent to foreign reporters in Israel, most of whom were attending a festival at Tel Aviv's Cultural Center celebrating a state visit to Israel by the Queen Elisabeth of Belgium. IDF Chief of Staff Haim Laskov and Chief of Reserves Meir Zorea were also attending. Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion had been entertaining Queen Elisabeth when the crisis began. Similarly, the neighboring Arab states, which monitored Israeli radio, believed <b>that</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>was</b> preparing to launch a surprise attack on them, and began to ready their own troops. Syria began moving troops to the Israeli border to prepare for an IDF attack. It took considerable efforts by the government to calm the civilian population, and international efforts to mollify the neighboring states and convince them <b>that</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>was</b> not preparing for war.|$|R
