5|$|After the referendum, Lukashenko {{convened a}} new {{parliamentary}} assembly from those {{members of the}} parliament who were loyal to him. After between ten and twelve deputies withdrew their signature from the impeachment petition, only about forty deputies of the old parliament were left and the Supreme Soviet was dismissed by Lukashenko. Nevertheless, international organizations and many Western countries do not recognize the current parliament given <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> formed. At the start of 1998, the Central Bank of Russia suspended trading in the Belarusian ruble, {{which led to a}} collapse {{in the value of the}} currency. Lukashenko responded by taking control of the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus, sacking the entire bank leadership and blaming the West for the free fall of the currency.|$|E

For one of the men, when the desire wears off he decides that he really does want Chloe and kidnaps her.|$|E

The planet in orbit around Kepler-8, Kepler-8b, was the fifth of the first five planets discovered by the Kepler spacecraft; the first three planets confirmed by Kepler had been previously discovered, and were only used to verify the accuracy of Kepler's measurements. Kepler-8b's discovery was announced to the public on January 4, 2010 at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington, D.C., alongside planets in orbit around Kepler-4, Kepler-5, Kepler-6, and Kepler-7.|$|E
