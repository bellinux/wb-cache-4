40|$|RF sheath {{physics is}} one of the key topics {{relevant}} for improvements of ICRF heating systems, which are present on nearly all modern magnetic fusion machines. This paper introduces developement and validation of a new approach to understanding general RF sheath physics. The presumed reason of enhanced plasma-antenna interactions, parallel electric field, is not measured directly, but proposed to be obtained from simulations in COMSOL Multiphysics® Modeling Software. Measurements of RF magnetic field components with B-dot probes are done on a linear device IShTAR (Ion cyclotron Sheath <b>Test</b> <b>ARrangement)</b> and then compared to simulations. Good resulting accordance is suggested to be the criterion for trustworthiness of parallel electric field estimation as a component of electromagnetic field in modeling. A comparison between simulation and experiment for one magnetic field component in vacuum has demonstrated a close match. An additional complication to this ICRF antenna field characterization study is imposed by the helicon antenna which is used as a plasma ignition tool in the <b>test</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The plasma case, in contrast to the vacuum case, must be approached carefully, since the overlapping of ICRF antenna and helicon antenna fields occurs.
