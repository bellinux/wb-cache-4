5|$|In late 1997, the Community Healthcare Network renamed {{one of its}} Brooklyn, New York, clinics the Dr. Betty Shabazz Health Center, {{in honor}} of Shabazz. The Betty Shabazz International Charter School was founded in Chicago, Illinois, in 1998 and named in her honor. In 2005, Columbia University {{announced}} {{the opening of the}} MalcolmX and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center. The memorial is located in <b>the</b> <b>Audubon</b> Ballroom, where MalcolmX was assassinated. In March 2012, New York City co-named Broadway at the corner of West 165th Street, the corner in front of <b>the</b> <b>Audubon</b> Ballroom, Betty Shabazz Way.|$|E
5|$|The {{march was}} {{endorsed}} by <b>the</b> <b>Audubon</b> Society of Portland, Oregon Health & Science University, and Xerces Society, and promoted by the Democratic Party of Washington County, Oregon Environmental Council, Portland State University's biology department, and Rose City Astronomers.|$|E

5|$|Despite some {{critical}} reviews, {{the film was}} popular, especially with women, and financially successful. Double-file lines over a block long were reported for opening-week showings at <b>the</b> <b>Audubon</b> Theatre in New York. After the incorporation of the Fox Film Corporation, distribution of this film continued under the new company's name. The success of the initial New York showings featured in subsequent advertising, as did Fox's greatly inflated claims {{of the cost of}} production.|$|E
5|$|He {{also served}} on the {{editorial}} boards of numerous prestigious scientific and professional journals. A lover of nature, bird watching, and botany from an early age, he was {{a founding member of}} the South Bend, Indiana chapter of <b>the</b> <b>Audubon</b> Society, and of both the first local chapter of The Nature Conservancy (TNC) in New York, and the Conservancy's Indiana Chapter. He {{served on the}} Board of Governors of TNC from 1959 to 1965.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{mentions}} of fishers in literature occurred in <b>The</b> <b>Audubon</b> Book of True Nature Stories.

5|$|The biology {{department}} {{operates the}} Thomas McCulloch Museum. The most notable of the museum's exhibits is its preserved birds collection. Other exhibits include its collection of lorenzen ceramic mushrooms, its coral and shell collection, and its butterfly and insect collection. The museum's namesake Thomas McCulloch was a Scottish Presbyterian minister {{who served as}} Dalhousie's first president and created <b>the</b> <b>Audubon</b> mounted bird collection which is now housed at the museum.|$|E
5|$|Amid rainy weather, {{thousands}} of people attended the demonstration, gathering at a rally at Tom McCall Waterfront Park before marching 44 blocks of downtown Portland. Speakers included Earl Blumenauer, Suzanne Bonamici, and Elizabeth Steiner Hayward. Organizations that promoted the protest included <b>the</b> <b>Audubon</b> Society of Portland, Oregon Environmental Council, Oregon Health & Science University, and Xerces Society. Reporters noted organizers' attempts to create a political yet nonpartisan atmosphere, and participants' public criticism of Trump. The event featured activities for children and was described as having a family-friendly atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|Basalt, mostly {{covered by}} silt in the uplands and {{sediment}} in the lowlands, underlies the Balch Creek watershed. The {{upper part of}} the watershed includes private residential land, <b>the</b> <b>Audubon</b> Society of Portland nature sanctuary, and part of Forest Park. Mixed conifer forest of Coast Douglas-fir, western redcedar, and western hemlock with a well-developed understory of shrubs and flowering plants is the natural vegetation. Sixty-two species of mammals and more than 112species of birds use Forest Park. A small population of coastal cutthroat trout resides in the stream, which in 2005 was the only major water body in Portland that met state standards for bacteria, temperature, and dissolved oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Plume {{harvesting}} {{became a}} dangerous business. <b>The</b> <b>Audubon</b> Society became {{concerned with the}} amount of hunting being done in rookeries in the mangrove forests. In 1902, they hired a warden, Guy Bradley, to watch the rookeries around Cuthbert Lake. Bradley had lived in Flamingo within the Everglades, and was murdered in 1905 by one of his neighbors after he tried to prevent him from hunting. Protection of birds was the reason for establishing the first wildlife refuge when President Theodore Roosevelt set Pelican Island as a sanctuary in 1903.|$|E
5|$|In one of {{her last}} public appearances, Carson testified before President John F. Kennedy's Science Advisory Committee. The {{committee}} issued its report on May 15, 1963, largely backing Carson's scientific claims. Following the report's release, she also testified before a U.S. Senate subcommittee to make policy recommendations. Though Carson received hundreds of other speaking invitations, {{she was unable to}} accept the great majority of them. Her health was steadily declining as her cancer outpaced the radiation therapy, with only brief periods of remission. She spoke as much as she was physically able, however, including a notable appearance on The Today Show and speeches at several dinners held in her honor. In late 1963, she received a flurry of awards and honors: <b>the</b> <b>Audubon</b> Medal (from the National Audubon Society), the Cullum Geographical Medal (from the American Geographical Society), and induction into the American Academy of Arts and Letters.|$|E
5000|$|... ʻElepaio is a {{bimonthly}} peer-reviewed scientific journal {{published by}} <b>the</b> Hawaii <b>Audubon</b> Society (<b>the</b> Hawaii chapter of <b>the</b> National <b>Audubon</b> Society). It {{is named after}} a small Hawaiian bird. The journal was established in 1939.|$|R

50|$|Several years later, {{discouraged}} by disputes with partners {{and the failure}} of the lead mine on <b>the</b> property, <b>Audubon</b> sold Mill Grove and moved to Kentucky to seek his fortune as a frontier merchant. Mill Grove then became the property of Samuel Wetherill of Philadelphia who purchased the property in 1813. It remained in the family until Herbert J. Wetherill sold it in 1951 to Montgomery County. In April 2003 <b>the</b> National <b>Audubon</b> Society and Montgomery County signed an agreement creating <b>the</b> Mill Grove <b>Audubon</b> Center. <b>The</b> center is managed by <b>Audubon</b> Pennsylvania, <b>the</b> state office of <b>the</b> National <b>Audubon</b> Society.|$|R
5|$|Nearby {{tracts of}} habitat {{strongly}} affect the wildlife in the Balch Creek watershed. This {{is especially true}} of Forest Park, which extends into other watersheds to the northwest. Birds and animals from these watersheds and from the Tualatin River valley, the Coast Range, the Willamette River, Sauvie Island, the Columbia River, and the Vancouver, Washington, lowlands, move {{in and out of the}} park with relative ease. Sixty-two mammal species, including the northern flying squirrel, black-tailed deer, creeping vole, bobcat, coyote, Mazama pocket gopher, little brown bat, Roosevelt elk, and Pacific jumping mouse use Forest Park. blue grouse, great horned owl, hairy woodpecker, Bewick's wren, orange-crowned warbler, osprey, and hermit thrush are among the 112species of birds that frequent the area. Amphibian species seen at <b>the</b> <b>Audubon</b> Society pond include rough-skinned newts, Pacific tree frogs, and salamanders.|$|E
5|$|Smith favored women's suffrage, {{and was an}} Episcopalian by religion. She was {{a member}} of the Chicago Woman's Club, Chickaming Country Club, North Side Branch Equal Suffrage League, and <b>the</b> <b>Audubon</b> Society. In 1897, she moved into the {{settlement}} house and lived there until 1924. At that time, she lived in the home of Mary Rozet Smith, where she remained until around 1934. Smith returned to Hull House as a resident until she retired in 1936, and was succeeded by her sister, Gertrude. For health reasons, at that time, Smith moved to Midland, Michigan, where she resided with a niece until her death on June 30, 1942 in Midland. She was buried in Annapolis, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Audubon</b> Naturalist Society also {{actively}} opposed such spraying programs, and recruited Carson to {{help make}} public the government's exact spraying practices and the related research. Carson began the four-year project of what would become Silent Spring by gathering examples of environmental damage attributed to DDT. She also attempted to enlist others to join the cause: essayist E. B. White, {{and a number of}} journalists and scientists. By 1958, Carson had arranged a book deal, with plans to co-write with Newsweek science journalist Edwin Diamond. However, when The New Yorker commissioned a long and well-paid article on the topic from Carson, she began considering writing more than simply the introduction and conclusion as planned; soon it was a solo project. (Diamond would later write one of the harshest critiques of Silent Spring).|$|E
50|$|In 2001, {{she became}} a Development Officer for the Maryland-DC Office of <b>the</b> National <b>Audubon</b> Society and worked there until 2003. While working for <b>the</b> National <b>Audubon</b> Society, she started her own company, Dragonfly Designs, LLC., which is a graphic and web-design company.|$|R
50|$|Hemenway and Hall {{recruited}} William Brewster, {{a leading}} ornithologist to be <b>the</b> Massachusetts <b>Audubon</b> Society's first president. The group used its political power {{to have a}} Massachusetts law passed in 1897 outlawing trade in wild bird feathers and the 1900 Lacey Act, which prohibits interstate shipment of animals killed in violation of local laws. <b>The</b> Massachusetts <b>Audubon</b> Society remains independent, but it helped to organize the National Association of Audubon Societies (incorporated in 1905), which later became <b>the</b> National <b>Audubon</b> Society.|$|R
50|$|She was {{inducted}} into the Wisconsin Conservation Hall of Fame in 1999. <b>The</b> Schlitz <b>Audubon</b> Center's annual natural yards tour now bears her name.

5|$|The puffins are {{energetic}} burrow-engineers and repairers and {{the grassy}} slopes may be undermined by {{a network of}} tunnels. This causes the turf to dry out in summer, vegetation to die and dry soil be whirled away by the wind. Burrows sometimes collapse, and humans may cause this to happen by walking incautiously across nesting slopes. A colony on Grassholm was lost through erosion when there was so little soil left that burrows could not be made. New colonies are very unlikely to start up spontaneously because this gregarious bird will only nest where others are already present. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>Audubon</b> Society had success on Eastern Egg Rock Island in Maine, where, after a gap of ninety years, puffins were reintroduced and started breeding again. By 2011 there were over 120 pairs nesting on the small islet. On the Isle of May {{on the other side}} of the Atlantic, only five pairs of puffins were breeding in 1958 while twenty years later there were 10,000 pairs.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two sets}} of {{lighting}} in the top spires and decoration. The first are the V-shaped lighting inserts in the steel of the building itself. Added later were groups of floodlights that are on mast arms directed back at the building. This allows {{the top of the}} building to be lit in many colors for special occasions. The tube lighting atop the building was added in 1981, although it {{had been part of the}} original design. Until 1998 the lights were turned off at 2a.m., but New York Observer columnist Ron Rosenbaum convinced Tishman Speyer to keep the lights on until 6a.m. Since 2015, the Chrysler Building and other city skyscrapers have been part of <b>the</b> <b>Audubon</b> Society's Lights Out program, wherein the building turns off its lights during bird migration seasons.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Belize <b>Audubon</b> Society {{was formed}} in 1969 by Dora Weyer {{and a group of}} conservationists. The Society was formed with a vision to inspire people to live in harmony with and benefit from the environment. The first {{president}} of <b>the</b> Belize <b>Audubon</b> Society, James A. Waight, served from 1969 until 1986. He was born in Belize City and was the Surveyor General of Belize. His dedication to <b>the</b> Belize <b>Audubon</b> Society is honored by an annual award for services to conservation in Belize called the James A. Waight Award. <b>The</b> Belize <b>Audubon</b> Society aims at conserving and protecting wildlife in Belize for the benefit of humanity and the earth's biological diversity. In 1973 the society's first launched conservation project, the Jabiru Stork, was added to Belize's list of protected species.|$|R
