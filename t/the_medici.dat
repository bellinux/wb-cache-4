He may have had ties to Medici family political or business interests. In 1512 when the government of Florence feared the return of <b>the</b> <b>Medici</b> from exile, Francesco was imprisoned and fined 1,000florins.

5|$|Gian Gastone {{arrived in}} Tuscany, without his wife, in 1708. The Emperor, {{thinking}} {{it unlikely that}} any male heirs were to be born to <b>the</b> <b>Medici,</b> prepared to occupy Tuscany, under the pretext of Medici descent. He intimated that upon the Grand Prince's death the Tuscans would rebel against Cosimo's autocratic government. Cosimo, {{in an act of}} desperation, had Francesco Maria, <b>the</b> <b>Medici</b> family cardinal, renounce his religious vows and marry Eleanor of Gonzaga, the youngest child of the incumbent Duke of Guastalla. Two years later, Francesco Maria died, taking with him any hope of an heir.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo was a {{contemporary}} of Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Perugino, {{who were all}} slightly older than he was. He would have met them at the workshop of Verrocchio, with whom they had associations, and at the Academy of <b>the</b> <b>Medici.</b> Botticelli was a particular favourite of <b>the</b> <b>Medici</b> family, and thus his success as a painter was assured. Ghirlandaio and Perugino were both prolific and ran large workshops. They competently delivered commissions to well-satisfied patrons who appreciated Ghirlandaio's ability to portray the wealthy citizens of Florence within large religious frescoes, and Perugino's ability to deliver a multitude of saints and angels of unfailing sweetness and innocence.|$|E

5000|$|In overall {{charge of}} the legion's medical staff and {{services}} was the legion's executive officer, the praefectus castrorum. Directly under him was the optio valetudinarii, or director of the hospital in the legionary fortress, who would have overall charge of its administration and staff. However, the clinical head of the legion's medical service was the chief physician, called simply <b>the</b> <b>Medicus</b> (<b>the</b> capital [...] "M" [...] here is used to distinguish from several other ranks of medicus). Most often an ethnic-Greek from {{the eastern part of}} <b>the</b> Empire, <b>the</b> <b>Medicus</b> was generally a highly qualified practitioner, occasionally even a published academic. The most notable example is Pedanius Dioscorides, an army surgeon in the time of Nero, who published Materia Medica, which remained for centuries the standard textbook on medicine. The rank of <b>the</b> <b>Medicus</b> is uncertain, but was probably {{on a par with the}} military tribunes i.e. equestrian. In many cases, <b>the</b> <b>Medicus</b> served a short commission, in the role of senior medical consultant, and then returned to civilian life.|$|R

40|$|Celso, proem. 73 : Cum par scientia it, utiliorem tamen medicum esse amicum quam extraneum, proposes an {{innovative}} {{interpretation of the}} work of <b>the</b> <b>medicus.</b> It is <b>the</b> figure of <b>the</b> <b>medicus</b> gratiosus, kind, pleasant, courteous, but also authoritative and influential to this, with virtues such as reliability and mercy, uninterested in money, worried about his patient and always present at critical moments. In ancient Roman medicine there is <b>the</b> concept of <b>medicus</b> amicus, peculiarity clearly emerges in Seneca the Younger’s work and it refers to a specific aspect of the medical practice, especially during the first imperial era. Seneca the Elder, analysing the work of a physician, refers a event about the difficult relationship between father, son and stepmother, because the son doctor can not cure the stepmother. There are two versions of this event. In fact Luciano di Samostata and Seneca the Elder describe this strong controversy between father and son, but Luciano refers to the more “technical” side of greek medicine, Seneca regards the specific aspects of <b>medicus</b> amicus. <b>The</b> figure of <b>the</b> <b>medicus</b> amicus describes a relationship of friendship and sympathy between the physician and the patient, highlighting the moral aspect of ancient medicine as the most important...|$|R
50|$|In April 2013 an EU-led {{court in}} Kosovo found five people guilty in {{connection}} with a human organ-trafficking ring at <b>the</b> <b>Medicus</b> Clinic in Pristina.

The trade was discovered when a Turkish man collapsed after having one of his kidneys removed at the clinic. The clinic's director, urologist Lutfi Dervishi was sentenced to eight years in prison for organised crime and human trafficking. His son, Arban, was sentenced to seven years and three months, while three other defendants received between one and three years' imprisonment.

5|$|Florentine {{court records}} of 1476 show that Leonardo {{and three other}} young men were charged with sodomy but acquitted; {{homosexual}} acts were illegal in Renaissance Florence. From that date until 1478 {{there is no record}} of his work or even of his whereabouts. In 1478, he left Verrocchio's studio and was no longer a resident at his father's house. One writer, called the Anonimo Gaddiano, claims that in 1480 Leonardo was living with <b>the</b> <b>Medici</b> and working in the Garden of the Piazza San Marco in Florence, a Neo-Platonic academy of artists, poets and philosophers that <b>the</b> <b>Medici</b> had established. In January 1478, he received an independent commission to paint an altarpiece for the Chapel of St. Bernard in the Palazzo Vecchio; in March 1481, he received a second independent commission for The Adoration of the Magi for the monks of San Donato a Scopeto. Neither commission was completed, the second being interrupted when Leonardo went to Milan.|$|E
5|$|Having {{seen the}} concerto delle donne in Ferrara, Caccini created a rival group {{made up of}} his family and a pupil. This {{ensemble}} was sponsored by <b>the</b> <b>Medici,</b> and traveled as far abroad as Paris to perform for Marie de' Medici. Francesca Caccini had much success composing and singing {{in the style of the}} concerto delle donne. Beginning in 1585, rival groups were created in Florence by <b>the</b> <b>Medici,</b> Rome by the Orsini, and Mantua by the Gonzaga. There was even a rival group in Ferrara based in the Castello Estense, the very palace where the concerto delle donne performed. This group was formed by Alfonso's sister Lucrezia d'Este, Duchess of Urbino. She had lived at the Este court since 1576, and shortly after Margherita's marriage to Alfonso in 1579, Alfonso and his henchmen killed Lucrezia's lover. Lucrezia was unhappy about being replaced as the matron of the house by Margherita, and upset by the murder of her lover, leading to her desire to be separate from the rest of her family during her evening entertainments.|$|E
5|$|Poliphilus {{is named}} after the book Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, one of Manutius's most famous books in the Latin alphabet, which was printed with the same roman as De Aetna but recut capitals; it was made for <b>the</b> <b>Medici</b> Society, who planned to create an English translation. Blado {{is named after}} the printer Antonio Blado, a {{colleague}} of Arrighi. Morison preferred Bembo's roman and was somewhat dismissive of Poliphilus.

5|$|The concerto delle donne {{revolutionized}} {{the role of}} women in professional music, and continued the tradition of the Este court as a musical center. Word of the ladies' ensemble spread across Italy, inspiring imitations in the powerful courts of <b>the</b> <b>Medici</b> and Orsini. The founding of the concerto delle donne was the most important event in secular Italian music in the late sixteenth century; the musical innovations established in the court were important in the development of the madrigal, and eventually the seconda pratica.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of perspective {{was part of}} a wider trend towards realism in the arts. Painters developed other techniques, studying light, shadow, and, famously in the case of Leonardo da Vinci, human anatomy. Underlying these changes in artistic method was a renewed desire to depict the beauty of nature and to unravel the axioms of aesthetics, with the works of Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael representing artistic pinnacles that were much imitated by other artists. Other notable artists include Sandro Botticelli, working for <b>the</b> <b>Medici</b> in Florence, Donatello, another Florentine, and Titian in Venice, among others.|$|E
5|$|The finest {{rooms were}} {{decorated}} by Pietro da Cortona {{in the high}} baroque style. Initially Cortona frescoed a small room on the piano nobile called the Sala della Stufa with a series depicting the Four Ages of Man which were very well received; the Age of Gold and Age of Silver were painted in 1637, followed in 1641 by the Age of Bronze and Age of Iron. They are regarded among his masterpieces. The artist was subsequently asked to fresco the grand ducal reception rooms; a suite of five rooms {{at the front of}} the palazzo. In these five Planetary Rooms, the hierarchical sequence of the deities is based on Ptolomeic cosmology; Venus, Apollo, Mars, Jupiter (<b>the</b> <b>Medici</b> Throne room) and Saturn, but minus Mercury and the Moon which should have come before Venus. These highly ornate ceilings with frescoes and elaborate stucco work essentially celebrate <b>the</b> <b>Medici</b> lineage and the bestowal of virtuous leadership. Cortona left Florence in 1647, and his pupil and collaborator, Ciro Ferri, completed the cycle by the 1660s. They were to inspire the later Planet Rooms at Louis XIV's Versailles, designed by Le Brun.|$|E
