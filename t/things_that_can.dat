5|$|Empiricist David Hume's {{requirement}} that claims about reality must be verified by evidence influenced the logical positivist movement, particularly the philosopher A. J. Ayer. The movement proposed that, for {{a statement to}} hold meaning, it must be possible to verify its truthfulness empirically– with evidence from the senses. Consequently, the logical positivists argued that religious language must be meaningless because the propositions it makes are impossible to verify. Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein has been regarded as a logical positivist by some academics because he distinguished between <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> and cannot be spoken about; others have argued {{that he could not}} have been a logical positivist because he emphasised the importance of mysticism. British philosopher Antony Flew proposed a similar challenge based on the principle that, in so far as assertions of religious belief cannot be empirically falsified, religious statements are rendered meaningless.|$|E
5|$|Creatures are {{attracted}} via Portals. Which ones come {{depend on the}} dungeon's composition. Each has its own abilities (such as spells they can cast), expertise, and job preferences. Creatures include Bile Demons, Warlocks, and Salamanders. Like the first game, creatures can be slapped with the hand to make them work harder, {{at the cost of}} their health. Certain creatures, such as Vampires and Skeletons cannot be attracted via Portals. They are obtained by their corpse decomposing in a Graveyard, and dying in captivity respectively. Certain sacrifices in the Temple, a room where creatures pray, also yield the acquisition of certain creatures. Creatures frequently enter combat (each follow one of four combat strategies) against creatures belonging to enemy keepers, or heroic forces defending the realm. Heroes enter the level via Hero Gates. The heroics forces are composed of different units to keepers: heroes include Wizards, Giants, and Guards. Most creatures have a heroic counterpart: for example, the Wizard is the counterpart of the Warlock. Heroes and rival keepers' creatures can be converted to the player's cause in the torture chamber after being captured and imprisoned. Creatures dislike their heroic counterparts, and their company may make them angry, which can lead to rebellions. Rebelling creatures either leave the dungeon, or defect to another keeper or the heroes, and may take other creatures too. Other <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> annoy creatures and cause rebellions include lack of food, not getting paid (creatures require payment on a regular basis), and being slapped.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{this is not}} {{the only}} <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> the self wishes to do. According to Singh, having created time, the self wishes to {{dominate}} it—it wishes to [...] "dominate it and rule over it, to be its master." [...] This latter wish of the self comes from its self-image, that is, from the way it perceives itself. [...] "But how does the self perceive itself? What is its vision of itself? What is its dream?":Its dream is to dominate—to rule over—not only the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> it <b>can</b> see but also the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> it <b>can</b> think about, the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> it <b>can</b> imagine and not yet imagine, the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> it <b>can</b> conceive, invent, conjure up, the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> it <b>can</b> concoct—images, ideas, concepts and words, representations, notions, but not only these.

25|$|The game is {{primarily}} a variant on the tower defense game mechanic. Players must build traps and fortify doors and windows to keep a horde of zombies from entering a given building. During gameplay players can also scavenge the building for additional powerups, items and <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> assist in keeping the zombies at bay. The game can be played locally with four players in a splitscreen format, and includes ten single player levels along with an additional eight multiplayer co-op levels.|$|E
25|$|The art of divination is {{generally}} employed {{for the purpose}} of obtaining information that can guide the adept in his Great Work. The underlying theory states that there exists intelligences (either outside of or inside the mind of the diviner) that can offer accurate information within certain limits using a language of symbols. Normally, divination within Magick {{is not the same as}} fortune telling, which is more interested in predicting future events. Rather, divination tends to be more about discovering information about the nature and condition of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> help the magician gain insight and to make better decisions.|$|E

25|$|Dreyfus also {{identified}} a subtler assumption about the world. AI researchers (and futurists and science fiction writers) often {{assume that there}} is no limit to formal, scientific knowledge, because they assume that any phenomenon in the universe can be described by symbols or scientific theories. This assumes that everything that exists can be understood as objects, properties of objects, classes of objects, relations of objects, and so on: precisely those <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be described by logic, language and mathematics. The question of what exists is called ontology, and so Dreyfus calls this the ontological assumption. If this is false, then it raises doubts about what we can ultimately know and what intelligent machines will ultimately be able to help us to do.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} framework {{has more}} recently been {{put forward by}} Wilken and Ma (2004) who suggest that apparent capacity limitations in VSTM are caused by a monotonic decline {{in the quality of}} the internal representations stored (i.e., monotonic increase in noise) as a function of set-size. In this conception capacity limitations in memory are not caused by a limit on the number of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be encoded, but by a decline in the quality of the representation of each thing as more things are added to memory. In their 2004 experiments, they varied color, spatial frequency, and orientation of objects stored in VSTM using a signal detection theory approach (see also the closely related work by Palmer, 1990). The participants were asked to report differences between the visual stimuli presented to them in consecutive order. The investigators found that different stimuli were encoded independently and in parallel, and that the major factor limiting report performance was neuronal noise (which is a function of visual set-size).|$|E
25|$|In 1928, Allis-Chalmers {{acquired}} the Monarch Tractor Company of Springfield, Illinois, thus adding {{a line of}} crawler tractors. In 1929, it {{acquired the}} La Crosse Plow Works of La Crosse, Wisconsin. The La Crosse Plow Works had a good-quality plow and various desirable implements, which now expanded the Allis-Chalmers implement line. Also in 1929, Harry Merritt was in California when the bright orange California poppy blossoms inspired him {{to think about the}} use of bright colors in marketing. Brightly colored <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be seen from far away had potential in farm equipment marketing. He soon changed the paint color of Allis-Chalmers's tractors to Persian Orange, the available paint color that he felt most closely resembled the California poppy's color. Thus began the tradition of orange Allis-Chalmers tractors. Various competitors would follow suit over the next decade, as International Harvester switched to all-red (1936), Minneapolis-Moline switched to Prairie Gold (late 1930s), and Case switched to Flambeau Red (late 1930s). John Deere already had a distinctive color scheme with its bright green and yellow.|$|E

25|$|Broad {{protection}} {{actions are}} geared towards children who {{could potentially be}} trafficked, and include raising awareness about child trafficking, particularly in vulnerable communities. This type of outreach also includes policies geared towards improving the economic statuses of vulnerable families, so that reasonable alternatives are available to them, other than sending their children to work. Examples of this include increasing employment opportunities for adults and conditional cash transfer programs. Another major broad protection program that has been readily endorsed by UN.GIFT, the I.L.O, and UNICEF involves facilitating gender equality, specifically by enhancing both boys' and girls' access to affordable, quality education. Another way to raise awareness for child trafficking is by communities {{from all over the}} world dedicating a week to this situation. Observing the 2012 Human Trafficking Awareness Day in the US, and wider world. Community groups along with police enforcements are collaborating to organize events as well as in depth information sessions and support groups for the victims. The events held by communities could include films, guest speakers, booths, and many more <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> help people understand the seriousness of this issue. The ICE (Human Trafficking) has a help line for victims as well as conducts awareness in the U.S.A communities through the ICE In Plain Sight Campaign.|$|E
500|$|This episode aired {{as part of}} Green Week, an {{initiative}} introduced by NBC's Chief Executive Jeff Zucker which included having every primetime program which aired between November 15 and November 22, 2009, contain some sort of positive environmental theme. Jack McBrayer, who plays NBC page Kenneth Parcell, {{in regards to the}} environmental theme, said [...] "It's something that is relatable and is something {{that a lot of people}} are doing. Everybody is on board with greening up the place and being more environmentally friendly in real life. Every now and then people need to be reminded of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be done."

500|$|Following {{exposure}} with British {{magazines and}} newspapers and a successful performance on BBC Radio 1, Bloc Party received a contract offer from Parlophone. The band members declined the opportunity {{because they did not}} want to work for a major record label and instead signed a recording contract with East London indie label Wichita Recordings, chosen because it did not want to stamp its agenda on the conception of records. Frontman and chief writer Okereke wanted Silent Alarm to emphasise the importance of finding pleasure in small mundane things, because [...] "those are the sort of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be incredibly touching". The album was born out of [...] "a nagging youthful urgency" [...] and the realisation that responsibility has to be taken for the first time as a young adult. Before recording started, Okereke attended singing lessons to open up his voice.|$|E

500|$|Some People Change was {{the title}} of Montgomery Gentry's fifth album, which was {{released}} in 2006 under the production of Rutherford and Wright. Its title track, co-written by Neil Thrasher, Jason Sellers, and Michael Dulaney, was previously recorded by Kenny Chesney on his 2004 album When the Sun Goes Down. Gentry told the Edmonton Sun that Some People Change [...] "is based more on family issues, {{the love of the}} family, the love of neighbors, relationships", and said that the title track [...] "is about being able to challenge your inner demons and the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> bring people down, alcoholism, or hatred or racism." [...] Montgomery Gentry's version of the song peaked at number 7, followed by the two-week number 1 hit [...] "Lucky Man" [...] and the number 3 [...] "What Do Ya Think About That". In 2008, [...] "Lucky Man" [...] was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, the duo's first Grammy nomination.|$|E
500|$|Orci and Kurtzman read {{graduate}} school dissertations on the series for inspiration; they noted comparisons of Kirk, Spock and McCoy to Shakespearian archetypes, and Kirk and Spock's friendship echoing that of John Lennon and Paul McCartney. They also noted that, {{in the creation}} of this film, they were influenced by Star Wars, particularly in pacing. [...] "I want to feel the space, I want to feel speed and I want to feel all the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> become a little bit lost when Star Trek becomes very stately" [...] said Orci. Star Wars permeated in the way they wrote the action sequences, while Burk noted Kirk and Spock's initially cold relationship mirrors how [...] "Han Solo wasn't friends with anyone when they started on their journey." [...] Spock and Uhura were put in an actual relationship as a nod to early episodes highlighting her interest in him. Orci wanted to introduce strong Starfleet captains, concurring with an interviewer that most captains in other films were [...] "patsies" [...] included to make Kirk look greater by comparison.|$|E

[...] He also said there was room for improvement, [...] "Teams are blitzing us a lot more. We've handled it well for the most part, but there's so many {{things we can do}} better... If you ask every person on this offense, they'll tell you there's something individually they can do better." [...] After the loss to Oklahoma, Mack Brown said {{he did not want to}} hear about bad luck, [...] "By saying we're unlucky is just a cop-out, this game isn't about luck. [...] If you knock balls loose you should get on them. If you tip balls in the air you should catch them. We're not going to have any excuses." [...] Brown cited the lack of big plays on defense, particularly the lack of forced turnovers, as a problem for Texas. [...] Both Brown and Greg Davis hinted that Jamaal Charles could face less playing time as a result of his problems hanging onto the ball.|$|E
