500|$|The {{incident}} was widely reported and condemned by the Soviet press. Kharlamov himself believed that [...] "Bobby Clarke {{was given the}} job of taking {{me out of the}} game." [...] The slash was apparently done at the instigation of assistant coach John Ferguson. [...] "I remember that Kharlamov's ankle was hurting pretty bad. I called Clarke over to the bench, looked over at Kharlamov and said, 'I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> a tap on the ankle.' I didn't think twice about it. It was Us versus Them. And Kharlamov was killing us. I mean, somebody had to do it." [...] Canadian journalist Dick Beddoes asked Clarke about it later at a team reunion, calling it a [...] "wicked two-hander", to which Clarke replied [...] "Dick, if I hadn't learned how to lay on a two-hander once in a while, I'd never have left Flin Flon." ...|$|E
500|$|Giuliani {{became the}} {{presumptive}} Republican nominee, and by April 1999 {{had formed a}} formal exploratory committee for a Senate run. [...] There were still possible Republican primary opponents. Rick Lazio, a Congressman representing Suffolk County on Long Island, was raising money and had a candidacy announcement scheduled for August 16; he had openly discussed a primary against Giuliani, believing his more conservative record would be appealing to Republican primary voters. [...] In early August, under pressure from state and national Republican figures, Pataki endorsed Giuliani. [...] Pataki prevailed upon Lazio to forgo his candidacy, which Lazio agreed to despite frustration that Giuliani had still not officially {{announced that he was}} running; Lazio said, [...] "If the mayor wants to be a candidate, I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> to get into this race. It's time to put the soap opera aside and step up to the plate." [...] Nassau County Congressman Pete King also considered running and had raised some funds.|$|E

When he explains his plan to share a room with Arthur, Randolph feels a [...] "slight touch of pique."(172) He wins from Cope another assertion that he will never marry. At another of Mrs. Phillips' gatherings, Cope resents how Amy and Mrs. Phillips depict him as {{the hero of the}} sail-boating accident. Amy believes her relationship with Cope is growing more romantic. Mrs. Phillips feels Amy is interfering with Cope's role as her own acquisition. At the evening's end, Cope feels Amy's farewell was [...] "too much like the hand of possession."(186) He believes that Mrs. Phillips recognizes that Amy's attentions to him are misdirected.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2014, Robinson, {{was sacked}} by Yorkshire for [...] "unprofessional actions"; in the 2014 season, {{he had made}} 7 T20 Blast {{appearances}} for Yorkshire, taking 6 wickets. Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie said of the situation that [...] "When a player consistently displays behaviour that isn’t professional, {{there has to be}} a point in time when you say ‘look, this isn’t really working, you’re obviously not that bothered about playing for the club’. That point came, and it was tough." [...] and that [...] "He’s got to learn about his game and about being a professional sportsman. I think there will be a future for him in the professional game, but I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> to learn a lot, and I think he can do it." [...] Later in the 2014 season, Robinson made 1 List A appearance for Hampshire.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the sixth}} {{game of the}} series, Bobby Clarke slashed Kharlamov intentionally, {{fracturing}} a bone in his ankle. He would miss the seventh game of the series, {{and returned to the}} lineup for the final game of the series, but at much reduced effectiveness. At the time, many felt the slash was intentional. Assistant coach John Ferguson would later say [...] "I called (Bobby) Clarke over to the bench, looked over at Kharlamov and said, 'I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> a tap on the ankle'." [...] As for Kharlamov himself, he had little doubt that an attempt had been made to limit his effectiveness, [...] "I'm convinced that Bobby Clarke was given the job of taking me out of the game." [...] Kharlamov's injury, and his diminished play in the aftermath have been regarded as a turning point for the series in Canada's favour, who won the series in the eighth and final game.|$|E
2500|$|Clarke's line {{played against}} {{the line of}} the Soviets' top player, Valeri Kharlamov, during the entire series. After being on the {{receiving}} end of some stick work from Kharlamov while going for the puck, Clarke caught up with Kharlamov and laid a two-handed slash across his ankle, breaking it in the process. Though Kharlamov finished the game, he missed the seventh game and was largely ineffective in the eighth. When asked about the slash years later, Clarke said, [...] "If I hadn't learned to lay on a two-hander once in a while, I'd never have left Flin Flon." [...] 30 years after the series, Henderson criticized Clarke, calling the slash, [...] "the low point of the series." [...] Clarke responded saying that he thought it was [...] "improper to criticize a teammate thirty years later," [...] and that he did not [...] "understand why he would bring it up now." [...] Henderson has since retracted his criticism. Kharlamov, prior to his death in 1981, said he thought Clarke was tasked with [...] "taking me out of the game." [...] John Ferguson, Sr., an assistant coach with Team Canada in 1972, said, [...] "I called Clarke over to the bench, looked over at Kharlamov and said, 'I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> a tap on the ankle.' I didn't think twice about it. It was Us versus Them. And Kharlamov was killing us. I mean, somebody had to do it. And I sure wasn't going to ask Henderson." [...] Clarke, however, does not recall Ferguson telling him this.|$|E
