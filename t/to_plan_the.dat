This came as a surprise to the Haganah, which expected an attack from south Lebanon and Mishmar HaYarden. The Jewish villages on the original confrontation line were Ein Gev, Masada, Sha'ar HaGolan and both Deganias.|$|E
5|$|Combined Operations Headquarters {{worked closely}} with several {{intelligence}} organisations <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> <b>the</b> raid.

A detailed plan of the town of St Nazaire was provided by the Secret Intelligence Service, and information on the coastal artillery nearby was sourced from the War Office's Military Intelligence branch. Intelligence about the dock itself came from pre-war technical journals.|$|E

5|$|As {{opposed to}} film makers, virtual camera system creators {{have to deal}} with a world that is {{interactive}} and unpredictable. It is not possible to know where the player's character {{is going to be in}} the next few seconds; therefore, it is not possible <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> <b>the</b> shots as a film maker would do. To solve this issue, the system relies on certain rules or artificial intelligence to select the most appropriate shots.|$|E

5|$|Generalmajor Dietrich Peltz was <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> <b>the</b> {{operation}} {{having been}} appointed C-in-C of II. Fliegerkorps on 8 December.

On 14 December, Peltz officially initiated {{plans for a}} major blow against the Allies in northwest Europe. Peltz was not a fighter pilot; his combat record was as a dive bomber pilot, flying the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka. His experiences in Poland, in France, and during the early campaigns on the Eastern Front had moulded him into an outstanding ground attack specialist, making him an ideal candidate for planning Bodenplatte.|$|E
5|$|Ghosh, who co-wrote {{the story}} and the screenplay, began <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> <b>the</b> film while {{awaiting}} the release of his previous film Aladin (2009), but the dismal response to Aladin was a setback. He had to approach several producers to finance him for Kahaani, but was refused and discouraged from making the film owing to three factors: a pregnant woman as the lead star, a bunch of unknown Bengali actors as the supporting cast and Kolkata as a backdrop. Yashraj Films were willing to produce the film, but wanted Ghosh to sign a three-film deal, which he declined {{because he did not}} want that much commitment.|$|E

5|$|If the {{landings}} {{had gone}} <b>to</b> <b>plan,</b> <b>the</b> 11th Battalion {{was supposed to}} be crossing the plateau heading north. The 10th Battalion, south of the plateau, was to capture a Turkish trench and artillery battery behind Gun Ridge. The 9th Battalion, furthest south, was to attack the artillery battery at Gaba Tepe, and the 12th Battalion was the reserve, with 26th Jacob's Mountain Battery to establish their gun line on the plateau. Unknown to the ANZACs, the Turks had an artillery battery sited on 400 Plateau.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the more}} {{significant}} impacts of containment was {{the outbreak of the}} Korean War. In June 1950, Kim Il-sung's North Korean People's Army invaded South Korea. Stalin approved and sent advisers <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> <b>the</b> North Korean invasion. To Stalin's surprise, the UN Security Council backed the defense of South Korea, though the Soviets were then boycotting meetings in protest that Taiwan and not Communist China held a permanent seat on the Council. A UN force of personnel from South Korea, the United States, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Canada, Colombia, Australia, France, South Africa, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Belgium, New Zealand and other countries joined to stop the invasion.|$|E
