500|$|The Port lies in {{the extreme}} south near the sea, and is portrayed as a place full of strangers. Here ships load their cargo, which is {{verified}} by the customs officer, Alice Nettles (deceased). A dangerous coven called the Port Witch Coven can lure strangers into a trap or turn them into toads. There is a short cut from the Port to Zelda's house in the Marram Marshes. The author created the Port because of her love of <b>the</b> <b>hubbub</b> accompanying the arrival of boats. According to Sage, she sees the Port as full of [...] "beginnings and adventuresand endings too." ...|$|E
60|$|The village constable hurried up, {{his thin}} neck {{stretching}} {{out of his}} tunic, and demanded the cause of <b>the</b> <b>hubbub.</b>|$|E
60|$|These {{considerations}} {{made him}} a little anxious, and helped to keep his mind in <b>the</b> <b>hubbub</b> which has been mentioned.|$|E
60|$|A commotion at {{the front}} part of the train, more {{pronounced}} than <b>the</b> general <b>hubbub,</b> attracted their attention.|$|R
60|$|The dog, with a {{satisfied}} air, sat down panting by his chair, listening quietly to <b>the</b> subdued <b>hubbub</b> which sounded from the companion.|$|R
5000|$|He {{appears as}} {{himself in the}} Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band's [...] "The Intro and the Outro", saying [...] "hello there" [...] over <b>the</b> general <b>hubbub.</b>|$|R
60|$|There was a moment's rather queer silence. The music {{rose above}} <b>the</b> <b>hubbub</b> of voices and died away again. Louise {{rose to her}} feet.|$|E
60|$|I {{tried to}} explain to him that the cause of all <b>the</b> <b>hubbub</b> was a very {{remarkable}} and interesting echo, but he would not believe it.|$|E
60|$|An {{approximate}} silence followed, {{broken only}} by the mewing of a café cat and <b>the</b> <b>hubbub</b> and uproar of a few million citizens and transportation facilities outside.|$|E
60|$|And now {{such was}} <b>the</b> general <b>hubbub</b> {{provoked}} by these unprecedented prices that the dalal {{was forced to}} raise his voice and cry for silence.|$|R
60|$|FATHER BOURNE in the pulpit. A CROWD. MARCHIONESS OF EXETER, COURTENAY. The SIEUR DE NOAILLES and his man ROGER {{in front}} of <b>the</b> stage. <b>Hubbub.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{spoke in}} a whisper, trusting that in <b>the</b> general <b>hubbub</b> of <b>the</b> crowd her words would remain unheeded by all, save the man at her side.|$|R
6000|$|... "Citizen Carrier!" [...] cried Chauvelin {{at the top}} of his voice, {{trying to}} {{dominate}} <b>the</b> <b>hubbub,</b> [...] "one minute ... I have excellent news for you.... The English spy...." ...|$|E
60|$|Many groans and shrieks {{were heard}} below; {{then there was}} a sound of persons being carried out, and for awhile, quiet below, while outside <b>the</b> <b>hubbub</b> became greater.|$|E
6000|$|There was {{no mistaking}} it. His voice, which his enemies said was his one {{parliamentary}} asset, silenced <b>the</b> <b>hubbub</b> as toothache silences mere singing in the ears. He said: ...|$|E
6000|$|Chauvelin {{said nothing}} for the moment. He {{appeared}} wrapped in his own thoughts, listened {{for a while to}} <b>the</b> confused <b>hubbub</b> about <b>the</b> house, then he resumed abruptly: ...|$|R
60|$|Just {{the opening}} of a door! gently, noiselessly, until the sound from the Great Hall entered into this inner room, and voices clearly {{detached}} themselves from <b>the</b> confusing <b>hubbub.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The film {{ends with}} the Capellos assuring Jeremy that they love him and want to help him deal with his [...] "problem". Jeremy then {{introduces}} Darla to his delightfully surprised parents, while Ralph just shakes his head at <b>the</b> whole <b>hubbub.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Blow me tight, Bill," [...] some vulgar little hedge-sparrow would chirp out, in {{the midst}} of <b>the</b> <b>hubbub,</b> [...] "if I don't believe the gent thinks 'e's a- singing." ...|$|E
60|$|The crowd quickly drew back. The seconds {{once more}} assumed the bearing and imperturbable {{expression}} which their important function demanded. <b>The</b> <b>hubbub</b> ceased as the swords began to clash.|$|E
60|$|Bennet goes out. During {{this passage}} of arms between {{mistress}} and man a momentary lull {{has taken place}} in <b>the</b> <b>hubbub.</b> As he goes out, it begins to grow again.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{school of}} them!" [...] whispered Ailie, {{who had left}} her post at the mizzen-shrouds, and now stood by her father's side, looking on at <b>the</b> sudden <b>hubbub</b> in unspeakable amazement. [...] "Do whales go to school?" [...] she said, laughing.|$|R
60|$|It was {{the groom}} of the Earl's bedchamber, and seeing Myles {{standing}} thus raised above the others, he came {{walking down the}} length of the room towards him, <b>the</b> wonted <b>hubbub</b> gradually silencing as he advanced and the youngsters turning, staring, and wondering.|$|R
60|$|But what {{disturbed}} me {{most was}} <b>the</b> fearful <b>hubbub</b> {{which came from}} the camp below. Many of the tropical African tribes are really semi-nocturnal in their habits, I suppose because there the night is cooler than the day, and on any great occasion this tendency asserts itself.|$|R
60|$|When <b>the</b> <b>hubbub</b> of {{handshaking}} and congratulating had subsided, Isabella Spencer {{stepped out}} before the company. She looked almost girlish and bridal herself, with her flushed cheeks and bright eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here {{we could}} sit," [...] he cried to Amelia, [...] "in the most literal sense, under our own vine and fig-tree. Delicious retirement! For my part, I'm {{sick and tired}} of <b>the</b> <b>hubbub</b> of Threadneedle Street." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{that silence}} he strode up the steps, {{and entered the}} rush-strewn hall. As he {{vanished}} he heard <b>the</b> <b>hubbub</b> behind him break out anew, fiercer {{than it had been}} before. But he nothing heeded it.|$|E
60|$|I woke {{with the}} {{consciousness}} of violent wordy warfare carried on around me. I {{was lying on the}} ground, and the first things I saw were three or four pairs of feet standing close together. Gradually out of <b>the</b> confused <b>hubbub</b> a few sentences struck my reawakened senses.|$|R
60|$|When {{the little}} {{procession}} was once more {{ready to return}} to the village, the bearers of the dais were relieved by four other lads, and Andor found the means, during <b>the</b> slight <b>hubbub</b> which occurred while the procession was being formed, of working his way close to Elsa's side.|$|R
60|$|All <b>the</b> usual <b>hubbub</b> {{of noise}} that {{surrounded}} the neighborhood of the dormitory and the armory was stilled at their coming, and when the two noblemen had entered Sir James's office, the lads and young men gathered in knots discussing with an almost awesome interest what that visit might portend.|$|R
60|$|All the while, {{however, they}} had been running from the lioness, which brought them before they {{realized}} it right into camp. Our captive lions cut up fearfully at <b>the</b> <b>hubbub,</b> and the horses stampeded in terror.|$|E
60|$|A shout {{rose above}} <b>the</b> <b>hubbub</b> of voices. A tall man was {{pointing}} across the gulch where dust-clouds showed above the willows. Men crowded round him, all gazing {{in the direction}} of his hand, all talking at once.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not at all--by no means,' {{replied the}} unabashed Mr. Jingle--'overheard the tale--came {{to warn you}} of your danger--tender my services--prevent <b>the</b> <b>hubbub.</b> Never mind--think it an insult--leave the room'--and he turned, as if to carry the threat into execution.|$|E
60|$|Out of <b>the</b> {{confused}} <b>hubbub</b> that ensued Gilda could disentangle nothing definite; {{there was}} a good deal of shouting and clapping of pewter mugs against a table, and through it all that irresponsible, infectious laughter which--strangely enough--had to Gilda's ears at this moment a curious tone, almost of bitterness, as if its merriment was only forced.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Plate 65: Qué alboroto es este? (What is this <b>hubbub?).</b> <b>The</b> {{first print}} {{in the final}} group. The woman likely {{represents}} the rejected Constitution of 1812.|$|R
