5|$|Also, {{there have}} been a few unorthodox (unusual) causes of solar urticaria. For those {{susceptible}} to visible light, white T-shirts may increase the chances of experiencing an outbreak. In one case, doctors found that the white T-shirt absorbed UVA radiation from the sun and transformed it into visible light which caused the reaction. Another patient was being treated with the antibiotic <b>tetracycline</b> for a separate dermatological disorder and broke out in hives when exposed to the sun, the first case to implicate <b>tetracycline</b> as a solar urticaria inducing agent.|$|E

In those with neurosyphilis, intravenous penicillin G potassium or ceftriaxone is recommended. During treatment people may develop fever, headache, and muscle pains, a reaction known as Jarisch-Herxheimer.|$|E
5|$|Idiopathic {{intracranial}} hypertension {{is a condition}} of unknown cause characterised by a rise in CSF pressure.

Management may include ceasing any known causes, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such as acetazolamide, repeated drainage via lumbar puncture, or the insertion of a shunt such as a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.|$|E
40|$|The PhD thesis {{deals with}} {{determination}} of sulfonamides and <b>tetracyclines</b> in waste waters. Sulphonamides and <b>tetracyclines</b> {{are widely used}} in human and veterinary medicine. They are biologically active compounds and block biological processes in waste water treatment plants. These substances can influence microorganisms in the environment. Sulphonamides and <b>tetracyclines</b> induce resistance in low concentrations. These substances penetrate into the environment from industrial production, use in households, hospitals, veterinary clinics and fish farms. <b>Tetracyclines</b> and sulphonamides were determined in waste water from waste water treatment plants in Brno. Optimalization of extraction of these compounds was performed by solid phase extraction. Sulphonamides and <b>tetracyclines</b> were determined by liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detector or coupled with mass spectrometry. Optimalized method was used for determination <b>tetracyclines</b> and sulphonamides in waste water from waste water treatment plants in Brno in years 2007 – 2010...|$|R

50|$|Since glycylcyclines {{are similar}} to <b>tetracyclines,</b> they share {{many of the same}} side effects and {{contraindications}} as <b>tetracyclines.</b> These side effects may include nausea/vomiting, headache, photosensitivity, discoloration of growing teeth, and fetal damage.|$|R
5|$|Discoloration {{of teeth}} {{may result from}} {{bacteria}} stains, tobacco, tea, coffee, foods {{with an abundance of}} chlorophyll, restorative materials, and medications. Stains from bacteria may cause colors varying from green to black to orange. Green stains also result from foods with chlorophyll or excessive exposure to copper or nickel. Amalgam, a common dental restorative material, may turn adjacent areas of teeth black or gray. Long term use of chlorhexidine, a mouthwash, may encourage extrinsic stain formation near the gingiva on teeth. This is usually easy for a hygienist to remove. Systemic disorders also can cause tooth discoloration. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria causes porphyrins to be deposited in teeth, causing a red-brown coloration. Blue discoloration may occur with alkaptonuria and rarely with Parkinson's disease. Erythroblastosis fetalis and biliary atresia are diseases which may cause teeth to appear green from the deposition of biliverdin. Also, trauma may change a tooth to a pink, yellow, or dark gray color. Pink and red discolorations are also associated in patients with lepromatous leprosy. Some medications, such as <b>tetracycline</b> antibiotics, may become incorporated into the structure of a tooth, causing intrinsic staining of the teeth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tetracycline</b> {{staining}} {{leads to}} brown bands on {{the areas of}} developing enamel. Children up to age 8 can develop mottled enamel from taking <b>tetracycline.</b> As a result, <b>tetracycline</b> is contraindicated in pregnant women.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tetracycline</b> {{inhibits}} {{protein synthesis}} by blocking the attachment of charged aminoacyl-tRNA to the A {{site on the}} ribosome. <b>Tetracycline</b> binds to the 30S subunit of microbial ribosomes. Thus, it prevents introduction of new amino acids to the nascent peptide chain. The action is usually inhibitory and reversible upon withdrawal of the drug. Mammalian cells are less vulnerable {{to the effect of}} tetracyclines, despite the fact that <b>tetracycline</b> binds to the small ribosomal subunit of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (30S and 40S, respectively). This is because bacteria actively pump <b>tetracycline</b> into their cytoplasm, even against a concentration gradient, whereas mammalian cells do not. This accounts for the relatively small off-site effect of <b>tetracycline</b> on human cells.|$|E
40|$|The {{apparent}} sensitivities {{of several}} bacterial pathogens to <b>tetracyclines</b> varied {{by up to}} 128 -fold with the medium content of Fe, but not of other metals. The effect of Fe was independent of superoxide dismutase activity and of intracellular Fe, but accumulation of <b>tetracyclines</b> was blocked in high-Fe medium. Thus, synergistic suppression of bacterial growth {{in the presence of}} a low Fe concentration and <b>tetracyclines</b> arises because of elevated antibiotic accumulation...|$|R
25|$|Expired <b>tetracyclines</b> or <b>tetracyclines</b> {{allowed to}} stand at a pH less than 2 are {{reported}} to be nephrotoxic due {{to the formation of}} a degradation product, anhydro-4-epitetracycline causing Fanconi syndrome. In the case of doxycycline, the absence of a hydroxyl group in C-6 prevents the formation of the nephrotoxic compound. Nevertheless, <b>tetracyclines</b> and doxycycline itself have to be taken with precaution in patients with kidney injury, as they can worsen azotemia due to catabolic effects.|$|R
40|$|Low {{levels of}} <b>tetracyclines</b> found as {{residues}} in milk inhibited the biosynthesis of beta-galactosidase in Escherichia coli.

This relative selectivity was exploited {{for the development of}} a screening test for <b>tetracyclines</b> in milk based on a chemiluminometric assay of beta-galactosidase.

It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. <b>Tetracycline</b> is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 0.35 to 1.78 USD for a course of treatment. In the United States a course of treatment typically costs less than 25 USD. <b>Tetracycline</b> was originally made from bacteria of the Streptomyces type.|$|E

Paul Minieri, to obtain a patent on <b>tetracycline</b> and its fermentation process.

40|$|<b>Tetracyclines</b> are a {{class of}} {{antibiotics}} which could play a therapeutic role in several neurological disorders. Minocycline, extensively studied in animal models, decreased the size of ischaemic and haemorrhagic infarct. In Parkinson's disease models minocycline protected the nigrostriatal pathway, and in Huntington's disease and motoneuron disease models delayed the progression of disease extending the lifespan. Finally, in human diseases such as stroke and multiple sclerosis <b>tetracyclines</b> seem to play some neuroprotective role. The main biological effects of <b>tetracyclines</b> are the inhibition of microglial activation, the attenuation of apoptosis, and the suppression of reactive oxygen species production. These mechanisms {{are involved in the}} pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders. Several reports showed that minocycline reduced mitochondrial Ca(2 +) uptake, stabilized mitochondrial membranes, and reduced the release into the cytoplasm of apoptotic factors. Other effects include up-regulation of mitochondrial bcl- 2 (an antiapoptotic protein), direct scavenging of reactive oxygen species, and inhibition of mitogen activated protein kinases. It is still unclear which of these mechanisms plays the pivotal role in neuroprotective properties of <b>tetracyclines.</b> The anti-apoptotic effect of <b>tetracyclines</b> probably involves the mitochondrion. The major target for <b>tetracyclines</b> in neurodegeneration could lie within the complex network that links mitochondria, oxidative stress, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase- 1 and apoptosis. Here, we review the neuroprotective effects of <b>tetracyclines</b> in animal models and in human disease, and we focus on their possible mechanism(s) of action, with special regard to mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegeneration...|$|R
