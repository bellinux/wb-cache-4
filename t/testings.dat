25|$|Cavallo accused {{businessman}} Alfredo Yabrán in 1995 {{of being}} a sort of mafia boss who enjoyed political and judicial protection, who covertly ran several major transport and security companies including Correo OCA (which handled 30% of the Argentine postal market), and whose firms were involved in drugs and weapons trafficking and money laundering. After José Luis Cabezas, a photojournalist who was investigating Yabrán, was murdered in 1997, it was shown that Yabrán had connections {{at the highest levels}} of government and had bought Menem a mansion. Yabrán was found dead in 1998, a supposed suicide – although some observers questioned whether he had in fact killed himself, and some raised doubts as to whether the body was even his.

25|$|Milivi Adams was a {{girl from}} Vieques who {{developed}} and died of cancer and became a symbol {{in the battle against}} the presence of the military. Her face had appeared many times on the covers of Puerto Rican newspapers and magazines, and there were posters with her picture on them on many of Vieques' street corners. The daughter of Zuleyka Calderon and Jose Adams, Milivi was diagnosed with cancer at the age of two years. Although many people blamed the military's bomb <b>testings</b> in Vieques as the source of her cancer, this has not been proven. Given a month to live at the age of three, her cancer went into remission, but at the age of four reappeared, in her brain. She was flown to the United States by her parents, in hopes that treatment would help her; she fought infections, and after the last one, doctors told her parents that her body would not resist another infection treatment. She returned to Puerto Rico, where she died on the morning of November17, 2002.|$|E
25|$|When {{performing}} lossy audio encoding, such {{as creating}} an MP3 data stream, {{there is a}} trade-off {{between the amount of}} data generated and the sound quality of the results. The person generating an MP3 selects a bit rate, which specifies how many kilobits per second of audio are desired. The higher the bit rate, the larger the MP3 data stream will be, and, generally, the closer it will sound to the original recording. With too low a bit rate, compression artifacts (i.e., sounds that were not present in the original recording) may be audible in the reproduction. Some audio is hard to compress because of its randomness and sharp attacks. When this type of audio is compressed, artifacts such as ringing or pre-echo are usually heard. A sample of applause compressed or an excerpt of triangle instrument with a relatively low bit rate provides a good example of compression artifacts. Most subjective <b>testings</b> on perceptual codecs tend to avoid using this type of extremely critical sound materials however this type of artifacts generated by percussive sounds is barely perceptible on the MP3 format due to the specific temporal masking feature of the 32 sub-band filterbank of Layer II on which the MP3 format is based.|$|E

500|$|According to Ubisoft, [...] "teamwork, tactics, and tension" [...] {{were the}} game's three most {{important}} pillars. The team initially worked on a respawn feature, allowing players to rejoin after they are killed in the game. However, following several internal tournaments, the team realized {{that some of their}} employees would always win a match. They concluded that the respawn system worked to the benefit of strong players and placed individual skill above teamwork, which did not fit the developer's focus on game tactics. Removing the respawn feature meant greater consequences for taking risks, and players had to rely on their teammates in order to survive and achieve objectives. According to Chris Lee, the game's designer, the team initially worried that the system would only appeal to hardcore players. However, after several <b>testings,</b> they found that the removal of the respawn system provided new challenges to strong players and forced them to cooperate with their teammates – while it rewarded weaker players who were willing to take their time, plan their actions, and be strategic.|$|E
