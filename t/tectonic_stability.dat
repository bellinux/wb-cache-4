The geophysical studies have provided significant {{understanding of the nature}} of site deformation, <b>tectonics</b> and <b>stability.</b> Geophysical methods have delineated possible brine reservoirs beneath the underground facility and have defined the disturbed rock zone that forms around underground excavations. The role of geophysics in the WIPP project has evolved with the project. The early uses were for site characterization to satisfy site selection criteria or factors. As the regulatory framework for WIPP grew since 1980, the geophysics program supported experimental and field programs such as Salado hydrogeology and underground room systems and excavations. In summary, the major types of issues that geophysical studies addressed for WIPP are: Site Characterization; Castile Brine Reservoirs; Rustler/Dewey Lake Hydrogeology; Salado Hydrogeology; and Excavation Effects. The nature of geophysics programs for WIPP has been to support investigation rather than being the principal investigation itself. The geophysics program has been used to define conceptual models (e. g., the Disturbed Rock Zone-DRZ) or to test conceptual models (e. g., high transmissivity zones in the Rustler Formation). The geophysics program primarily supported larger characterization and experimental programs. Funding was not available for the complete documentation and interpretation.

5000|$|The Proterozoic Eon {{was a very}} tectonically {{active period}} in the Earth’s history. The late Archean Eon to Early Proterozoic Eon {{corresponds}} to a period of increasing crustal recycling, suggesting subduction. Evidence for this increased subduction activity comes from the abundance of old granites originating mostly after 2.6 Ga. [...] The appearance of eclogites, which metamorphic rocks created by high pressure (>1 GPa), are explained using a model that incorporates subduction. The lack of eclogites that date to the Archean Eon suggests that conditions at that time did not favor the formation of high grade metamorphism and therefore did not achieve the same levels of subduction as was occurring in the Proterozoic Eon. As a result of remelting of basaltic oceanic crust due to subduction, the cores of the first continents grew large enough to withstand the crustal recycling processes. The long-term <b>tectonic</b> <b>stability</b> of those cratons is why we find continental crust ranging up to a few billion years in age. [...] It is believed that 43% of modern continental crust was formed in the Proterozoic, 39% formed in the Archean, and only 18% in the Phanerozoic. [...] Studies by Condie 2000 and Rino et al. 2004 suggest that crust production happened episodically. By isotopically calculating the ages of Proterozoic granitoids {{it was determined that}} there were several episodes of rapid increase in continental crust production.

Our results from combined apatite fission track thermochronology and in situ cosmogenic radionuclide analyses using ^(10) Be and ^(26) Al show that while average exhumation rates are low, the denudation history for this cratonic region is incompatible with extreme, sub-aerial longevity and long-term <b>tectonic</b> and geomorphic <b>stability.</b> Our revised model for the landscape evolution of this region is consistent with one of maximum burial prior to and during the Mesozoic, followed by a phase of kilometre-scale exhumation that was largely complete {{by the beginning of}} the Cainozoic.

40|$|AbstractA late Pleistocene (Marine Isotope Stage 5 e) {{emergent}} marine sequence fringes {{the coastline}} of the Cape Region of coastal west central Australia and provides elevation and age control {{to characterize the}} locations and rates of crustal deformation. There is a systematic measurable change in relative paleo sea-level elevations across the Cape Region. High-precision leveling of modern and Pleistocene shoreline features indicates the minimum elevation range of MIS 5 e shoreline features along the coast is 10. 4 m. This compares with the 2. 5 m elevation range for observed modern shoreline analogs. The lack of continuity of MIS 5 e shoreline elevations along 300 km of coastline demonstrates continuing tectonic deformation along coastal anticlines in the Cape Region. Topographic expression of MIS 5 e features indicates tectonic uplift consistent with late Neogene to Quaternary deformation on the Cape Cuvier and Cape Range anticlines. Post-MIS 5 e tectonic uplift rates are up to 0. 054 ± 0. 035 mm/yr at fold axial locations. Estimated subsidence rates are − 0. 013 ± 0. 034 mm/yr on fold limbs.

The origin and evolution of such plateau regions at the convergence of the most active continental collision in the world remain elusive.

This finding suggests <b>tectonic</b> and morphologic <b>stability</b> of the plateau since at least Eocene times, only 15 – 20 Myr after the onset of the India–Asia collision. Our work contradicts the hypothesis that widespread low-relief surfaces in the northwest Himalaya result from efficient kilometre-scale glacial erosion during Quaternary times 4.

40|$|The Mount Painter Region in the Northern Flinders Ranges, South Australia, {{contains}} a Mesoproterozoic gneissic complex characterized by extraordinary heat production (∼ 16 μW m⁻³), {{resulting in the}} development of elevated middle-upper crustal thermal gradients through much of the Paleozoic. Early Paleozoic deformation and metamorphism attained amphibolite facies (> 500 °C) in the deepest parts of the metamorphic pile (∼ 10 – 12 km) during the ∼ 500 Ma Cambro-Ordovician Delamerian orogeny. The subsequent thermal history of these rocks is assessed through new K/Ar and ⁴⁰Ar/³⁹Ar age measurements on amphiboles and micas and multiple-diffusion-domain thermal modeling of K-feldspar ⁴⁰Ar/³⁹Ar data. The preferred interpretation of these data is that the deepest rocks were at ∼ 500 °C until around 430 Ma, requiring average upper crustal thermal regimes of the order of 40 °C km⁻¹ for at least 70 million years. At around 430 Ma, and again at 400 Ma, the terrane underwent periods of moderately fast cooling, possibly separated by a period of isothermal residence. Following cooling at 400 Ma, the terrane entered a second period of relative tectonic quiescence remaining essentially isothermal until ∼ 330 Ma. This long residence near the closure temperature of biotite resulted in variable argon loss from biotites in the 400 Ma to 330 Ma interval. <b>Tectonic</b> and thermal <b>stability</b> was terminated by a further period of moderately fast cooling (∼ 4 °– 8 °C Ma⁻¹) in the interval between 330 and 320 Ma.

40|$|Great {{achievements}} {{have been}} gained in assuring {{the safety of the}} lower Yellow River through arduous work in the past fifty years. But the disadvantages of boundary for river-flow are obvious, such as topography, tectonic movement and crustal stability. The main conflicts of less water and more sand, and the speeding up of sedimentation still exist, causing continuous river shrinkage. However, all the existing methods cannot completely avoid flood catastrophe, so a new control method needs to be explored. The method of changing-route based on geographical theory has always been a focus of debate over whether there are other feasible routes for the current Yellow River. From geoscientific point of view, this paper investigates whether there is a best feasible reservation route in Huang-Huai-Hai plain. Under the actual condition that the conflict between water and sand cannot be eradicated, the selection of the best reservation route should be the overlaying area of the optimum boundary conditions and the less social and economic loss. By detailed analysis of topography, <b>tectonic</b> movement, crustal <b>stability</b> and social-economic progress in the region of the lower Yellow River, the best reservation route is obtained by using the distance weighted function and the minimum cost function. The analysis result indicates that the reservation route can get rid of the influence of the elevation in central western Shandong Province, and the whole route flows through the Hai-Huang rift valley, which is good for channel stability. As to the basic parameters of water and sand movements, the gradient increases 36. 2 %, the length shortens 15. 4 % and the curvature reduces 12. 2 %. Using the reservation route can comparatively reduce the flood risk of the Yellow River, except that it will induce such problems as resettlement and relocation of towns, infrastructure reconstruction, water shortage in the abandoned area of the present route, as well as the resultant ecological and environmental degradation. But in contrast to the huge accumulative input to the harnessing of the Yellow River by the state, the absolute input of dealing with the above-mentioned problems is still acceptable. In the construction of corresponding infrastructures, using the reservation route will promote the region's socio-economic development and offer a rare chance of burgeoning...|$|R
40|$|Analyses of facies {{associations}} and biotic assemblages integrated with backstripping analysis are presented to improve {{understanding of the}} development of a shallow water Miocene carbonate ramp in the Central Apennines (Italy), with special reference to the relationships between tectonic subsidence and the internal architecture of the ramp. Subsidence curves were calculated for six measured sections located in different sectors of the platform. Dating is derived from Sr isotope analyses (from previous studies) and regional correlations. Corrections for eustasy and paleobathymetry were deduced from biota and facies analyses. The subsidence curves show rates that vary both in space and time. By analysing the vertical motions in different sectors of the ramp over a fixed time span (Burdigalian to Tortonian), it was possible to evaluate the control on platform architecture exerted by tectonically induced changes in sea-floor bathymetry and highlight the effects of tectonic migration. Most analysed sites experienced a short period of <b>tectonic</b> uplift or <b>stability</b> followed by a period of slow subsidence. This preceded increased subsidence which resulted in drowning of the shallow-water carbonate platform. The stability/uplift is progressively younger towards the north-eastern sectors that correspond to progressively more external zones of the foreland relative to the Apenninic orogenic belt. The subsequent drowning is related to the diachronous down-flexure of the Adriatic lithosphere due to its eastward retreating subduction under the Apennines. The small magnitude of the uplift suggests that the formation of a foreland bulge due to subduction-related flexure of the Adriatic plate was probably not the responsible mechanism. Hence, this uplift is related to the development of proto-thrusts or to the propagation of compressive stresses in the foreland. These vertical motions influenced the geometry of the platform during the 17. 5 - 16  Ma stage. During this period the platform was characterised by exceptional progradation of the bryomol-dominated proximal outer ramp facies belt. This rapid spreading may be induced by the combined effect of increased eutrophic conditions and a contemporaneous decrease in the sea-floor bathymetry resulting from the tectonic uplift. From the Tortonian onwards, when the platform became involved in the eastward migrating foredeep system, the tectonic subsidence curve records a short period of fast tectonic subsidence rates followed by a period of slow subsidence or slight uplift during basin drowning and infilling, respectively. © 2006 Elsevier B.

Combined with biostratigraphic age assignments using ammonites that apparently {{belonging to the}} Albian, the geomagnetic polarity sequence can be correlated with the middle part of chron C 34 n (C 34 n. 1 n-C 34 n. 2 n chrons, with an age of 100 – 105 Myr), the Cretaceous long normal interval. The magnetic properties and characteristic remanence of magnetization are dominated by soft and hard coercivity magnetic minerals. Rock-magnetic properties and a positive reversal test suggest that remanence is primary. The section displays both reverse and normal polarities with mean directions: D= 344.9 °, I= 32.4 °, k= 21, a 95 = 4.2 ° and D= 149.4 °, I=− 36.6 °, k= 17, a 95 = 8.7 °, respectively. Comparison with the North American apparent polar wander path indicates <b>tectonic</b> <b>stability</b> of the region since the Cretaceous.|$|E
40|$|In-situ {{weathered}} bedrock, saprolite, is locally {{found in}} Scandinavia, {{where it is}} commonly thought to represent pre-Pleistocene weathering possibly associated with landscape formation. The age of weathering, however, remains loosely constrained, which {{has an impact on}} existing geological and landscape evolution models and morphotectonic correlations. Here we provide new geochronological evidence that some of the low-altitude basement landforms on- and offshore southwestern Scandinavia are a rejuvenated geomorphological relic from Mesozoic times. K-Ar dating of authigenic, syn-weathering illite from saprolitic remnants constrains original basement exposure in the Late Triassic (221. 3 ± 7. 0 – 206. 2 ± 4. 2 [*]Ma) through deep weathering in a warm climate and subsequent partial mobilization of the saprolitic mantle into the overlying sediment cascade system. The data support the bulk geomorphological development of west Scandinavia coastal basement rocks during the Mesozoic and later, long-lasting relative <b>tectonic</b> <b>stability.</b> Pleistocene glaciations played an additional geomorphological role, selectively stripping the landscape from the Mesozoic overburden and carving glacial landforms down to Plio–Pleistocene times. Saprolite K-Ar dating offers unprecedented possibilities to study past weathering and landscape evolution processes...|$|E
