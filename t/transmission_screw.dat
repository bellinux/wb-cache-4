Aiming to net shape forming of <b>transmission</b> <b>screw</b> nuts with structure of SB/CF-EP, a new solution was proposed {{in which the}} high-strength casting wax was used as the release agent. A basic demolding experiment was designed and comparative demolding experiments were conducted for three different conditions: wax and grease as release agents and no agent. The influences of different agents and agent thickness on demolding force, product sizes and surface quality were studied. In comparison with grease and no release agent the demolding force for wax was reduced by 91. 6 % and 98. 0 % respectively. The product shrink could be compensated by controlling the wax thickness. By using wax release agent, the fabrication of <b>transmission</b> <b>screw</b> nuts with SB/CF-EP lining was successfully completed...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} focus on the environmental impact and energy consumption of {{the oil and gas}} industry. In offshore drilling equipment, electric motors tend to replace traditionally used hydraulic motors, especially in rotational motion control applications. However, force densities available from linear hydraulic actuators are still typically higher than those of electric actuators. Therefore, usually the remaining source of hydraulic power is thereby the hydraulic cylinder. This paper presents a feasibility study on the implementation of an electromechanical cylinder drivetrain on an offshore vertical pipe handling machine. The scope {{of this paper is to}} investigate the feasibility of a commercial off-the-shelf drivetrain. With a focus on the motion performance, numerical modeling and simulation are used when sizing and selecting the components of the considered electromechanical cylinder drivetrain. The simulation results are analyzed and discussed together with a literature study regarding advantages and disadvantages of the proposed solution considering the design criteria of offshore drilling equipment. It is concluded that the selected drivetrain can only satisfy the static motion requirements since the required transmitted power is higher than the recommended permissible power of the <b>transmission</b> <b>screw.</b> Consequently, based on the recommendation of the manufacturer, avoidance of overheating cannot be guaranteed for the drivetrain combinations considered for the case study presented in this paper. Hence, to avoid overheating, the average speed of the motion cycle must be decreased. Alternatively, external cooling or temperature monitoring and control system that prevents overheating could be implemented...|$|E

Considering the virtual coefficient is dimensionless and independent of the coordinate system, the virtual coefficient between input and output wrench screws {{is defined as the}} transmission factor, and used to evaluate kinematic performance of the spatial mechanism [33]. Then, the transmission factor is unitized [34], and the generalized <b>transmission</b> wrench <b>screw</b> is proposed [35, 36]. Chen et al. introduced the generalized transmission index and analyzed spatial linkages [37]. Further, input and output transmission indices as well as the total transmission index are proposed [38]. Above indices focus on the analysis of the input power efficiency of the driving joint and the output power efficiency of the branch. The power is calculated through the reciprocal product of twist and wrench screws. Screw theory is a powerful and systematic mathematical tool. However, definition and calculation of these indices are quite complicated, and not intuitive.|$|R

40|$|A Peierls {{model is}} used to study the role of {{interfacial}} sliding during dislocation <b>transmission.</b> A straight <b>screw</b> dislocation parallel to a bimaterial interface is considered, with incoming and outgoing slip planes that are continuous and coplanar. Interfacial sliding is predicted to increase the critical applied shear γcrit of interfaces for transmission. A simple explanation is that sliding delocalizes the dislocation core within the interface, thereby creating a larger, more abrupt fluctuation in dislocation line energy during transmission. Interfacial sliding and dislocation trapping are promoted by weak interfacial bonding, which is characterized primarily by small interfacial unstable stacking fault energy. The {{results are consistent with}} atomistic documenting showing dislocation trapping at interfaces...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for computing the transmission index of parallel mechanisms. The approach {{is based on an}} extended concept to compute the maximal virtual coefficient, which is an important notion involved in the formulation of dimensionally homogeneous transmission indices for singularity analysis and dimensional optimization of parallel mechanisms. By exploiting the dual property of the virtual coefficient, two characteristic points instead of one as in {{the current state of the}} art are defined: one characteristic point – termed the transmission characteristic point – is located on the ‘floating’ axis of the transmission wrench, as in existing approaches, while a second one – termed the output characteristic point – is located on the floating axis of the output twist of the platform, which is a novel concept. This allows one to define two characteristic lengths, namely, the transmission and output characteristic lengths, respectively, of which the larger is then used for the measure of the “distance” between the <b>transmission</b> wrench <b>screw</b> and the output twist screw. As shown in this paper, this new measure makes it possible to discern more finely the configuration-dependent properties of kinematic performance of parallel mechanisms, thus making it more suitable for dimensional optimization. Confidence in this statement is demonstrated through the comparative study of two in-parallel mechanisms using the new method and previously existing ones...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{employment}} of neural networks with sliding mode control in the control of a linear drive with flexible transmission element is described. Linear drives with flexible transmission elements are cheaper and also more efficient than the ones with rigid <b>transmissions</b> like power <b>screw</b> systems.

Neuro-sliding mode controller is used in the outer loop and produces reference for the discrete sliding mode controller which serves as a force controller, in the inner loop.

40|$|Current {{research}} on nanocrystalline metals and nanoscale multilayer thin films suggests extraordinary plastic strength {{is due to}} confinement of slip to individual grains or layers. To assess the magnitude of confinement, a Peierls model of slip <b>transmission</b> of a <b>screw</b> dislocation across a coherent, non-slipping interface is presented. The results reflect that large interfacial barriers to transmission are generated by rapid fluctuations in dislocation line energy near the interface due to elastic modulus mismatch, stacking fault energy mismatch, and antiphase boundary energy for transmission into an ordered phase. Coherency stress is predicted to dramatically alter the dislocation core configuration and impart additional strength regardless of the sign. Contributions to strength are not additive due to nonlinear coupling via the dislocation core configuration. The predicted barrier strength for a coherent (001) Cu/Ni interface is comparable to atomistic (EAM) results but larger than estimates from hardness data. 1...|$|R
50|$|The {{three main}} {{elements}} of a typical planetary roller screw are the screw shaft, nut and planetary roller. The screw, a shaft with a multi-start V-shaped thread, provides a helical raceway for multiple rollers radially arrayed around the screw and encapsulated by a threaded nut. The thread of the screw is typically identical to the internal thread of the nut. The rollers spin in contact with, and serve as low-friction <b>transmission</b> elements between <b>screw</b> and nut. The rollers typically have a single-start thread with convex flanks that limit friction at the rollers' contacts with screw and nut. The rollers typically orbit the screw as they spin (in the manner of planet gears to sun gear), and are thus known as planetary, or satellite, rollers. As with a lead screw or ball screw, rotation of the nut results in screw travel, and rotation of the screw results in nut travel.|$|R

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} simulations {{are performed}} {{to investigate the}} deformation mechanisms of nanotwinned materials. The simulations oftextured polycrystalline Cu under tensile loading parallel to the twin boundary (TB) reveal that the transmissions of dislocations dominate the plastic deformation. The majority of the TBs retain their initial coherency even after a considerable deformation. The tensile strength monotonically increases as the twin spacing decreases. The main strengthening effect in nanotwinned Cu results from TB restricting the dislocation transmission across TB. Dislocation processes involved in the slip-twin interactions are identified at atomic level, including the direct and indirect transmissions. The direct transmission involves either the successive transmission of the leading and trailing partials by the Fleischer cross-slip model or the absorption and desorption of the extended dislocation by the Friedel-Escaig cross-slip mechanism. In contrast, the indirect transmission involves the formation of special superjogs. The persistent slip transfer leaves zigzag slip traces on the cross-sectional view. The plastic anisotropy of individual grains leads to an inhomogeneous deformation, which results {{in the formation of}} intersected slip bands on the plane view. The simulations of nanotwinned Cu with different orientations reveal a dynamic transition in deformation mechanisms as the TB orientation changes. The dislocation activities in nanotwinned Cu obey the Schmid’s law. Three distinct dislocation processes are identified. When the TB is parallel or inclined by an angle less than 30 ° to the loading direction, the plastic deformation is dominated by the <b>transmission</b> of extended <b>screw</b> dislocations, which involves the successive transmissions of the leading and trailing dislocations and leaves the TB intact. As the angle of inclination increases, TB migration takes place in addition to slip transfer. When the TB is inclined by an angle between 30 ° and 60 ° with respect to the loading axis, TB migration governs the deformation. The nanotwinned samples can be fully twinned or detwinned to form single crystals depending on the TB orientations, which eliminates the TBs. When the TB is inclined by an angle between 60 ° and 90 ° to the loading axis, dislocation-TB interactions dominate the deformation, where deformation twins and shear bands are formed. Deformation twinning occurs under specific crystallographic orientations. The formation of deformation twins involves the motion of Shockley partial dislocations on adjacent { 111 } slip planes. Two twinning mechanisms are identified based on the arrangement of these Shockley partials. The first type of twins involves the overlap of Shockley partials of different types, which occurs when the TB is inclined by an angle between 15 ° and 30 ° to the loading direction. Thin twin plates embedded in the original grains are formed, which are not sable and can be easily eliminated under further deformation. The second type of twins results from the passage of Shockley dislocations of the same type, which takes place when the TB is inclined by an angle between 75 ° and 90 ° to the loading axis. Deformation twins are well developed along one primary twinning system in samples with inclination angles close to 75 °, while multiple twinning systems are activated in samples with inclination angles close to 90 °. The twinning dependence on the crystallographic orientation agrees with available experimental results to some extent. The simulations of nanotwinned Fe reveal a dynamic transition in the deformation mechanism as the TB orientation changes. The slip activities in nanotwinned Fe cannot be explained by the Schmid’s law alone. The TB orientation determines three distinct dislocation processes. When the TBs are parallel or inclined less than 30 ° to the loading direction, the samples eventually fracture in an almost brittle manner. The initial yielding in samples with slanted TBs is due to TB migration. When the TBs are inclined with angles between 45 ° and 60 ° to the loading direction, TB migration dominates the plastic deformation. The nanotwinned samples can be fully detwinned or twinned to form single crystals depending on the TB orientations, which eliminates the original TBs. When the TBs are inclined by more than 74 ° to the loading axis, dislocation-TB interactions are the main deformation mechanism, which forms complicated dislocation networks. Under vertical orientations, extensive slip transmission takes place in samples with small twin spacing, while twinning occurs in addition to conventional dislocation slip in samples with large twin spacing...|$|R
