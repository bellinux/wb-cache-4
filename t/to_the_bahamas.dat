5|$|Million Dollar Challenge is a {{poker game}} show where amateur poker players attempt to defeat celebrities, {{professional}} poker players and, eventually, Daniel Negreanu {{in order to}} win the show's grand prize, $1 million. In the first round, the amateur (with Negreanu at their side, acting as their coach and lending advice) must defeat a celebrity such as Jayde Nicole, Jerome Bettis, Joanna Krupa, John Salley or Tito Ortiz. If the contestant is able to defeat the celebrity the contestant wins a trip <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bahamas</b> and advances to the second round.

If the contestant is able to defeat the professional the contestant wins $25,000 in addition to the trip <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bahamas.</b> At this point, the amateur has a decision to make. Keep the money and walk away $25,000 richer, or risk the money (the trip is still theirs to keep) and play Daniel Negreanu heads-up for $100,000, knowing that if they lose they walk away with nothing but the trip <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bahamas.</b> In the season finale, the champions from each episode compete against each other in a sit-n-go tournament, the winner of which plays Negreanu for $1 million.|$|E
