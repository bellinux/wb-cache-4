40|$|Introdução:Avanços em ultrassonografia obstétrica nos últimos anos tem permitido detecção precoce deanomalias congênitas do rim e do trato urinário (CAKUT) no período antenatal. Pacientes com CAKUT podem evoluir com desfechos clínicos desfavoráveis ao longo da vida. Objetivo:O objetivo desse estudo é associar achados ultrassonográficos antenatais do sistema nefrourinário com a ocorrência de desfechos clínicos nos períodos pósnatal, infância e adolescência, em pacientes com CAKUT. Pacientes e Métodos:Trata-se de um estudo de coorte retrospectivo, com 823 pacientes com CAKUT detectados por ultrassom (US) realizado no Centro de Medicina Fetal do Hospital das Clínicas da UFMG (HC-UFMG) e seguidos por um tempo médio de 58, 7 meses na Unidade de Nefrologia Pediátrica HC-UFMG. Os achados ecográficos do último US que antecedeu o parto foram associados com os desfechos clínicos cirugia, hipertensão (HAS), infecção do trato urinário (ITU), infecção do trato urinário em vigência de quimioprofilaxia, doença renal crônica (DRC), doença renal crônica {{terminal}} e óbito. Para análise estatística, utilizou-se teste Qui-Quadrado de Pearson exato e o teste de Fisher exato. Para a determinação dos valores de prognóstico dos achados ultrassonográficos em relação aos desfechos clínicos, utilizou-se o cálculo de Odds Ratio. Resultados:Os achados ultrassonográficos antenatais do sistema nefrourinário em pacientes com CAKUT que apresentaram associação significativamente estatística com os desfechos clínicos, quando comparados com pacientes com CAKUT sem os respectivos achados foram: hidronefrose unilateral (redução de 42, 5 % na chance de ITU com quimioprofilaxia, 82. 9 % na chance de DRC, 89, 8 % na chance de doença renal terminal e de 2, 8 % na chance de óbito); hidronefrose unilateral isolada (redução de 57 % na chance de ITU com quimioprofilaxia, 89, 5 % na chance de DRC, 87, 7 % na chance de doença renal terminal e de 2, 5 % na chance de óbito);hidronefrose bilateral isolada (redução de 30, 7 % na chance de cirurgia e 90, 7 % na chance de doença renal terminal); achado ecográfico compatível com doença cística unilateral (redução de 66, 1 % na chance de cirugia);hidronefrose bilateral (aumento de 1, 7 vezes na chance de ITU com quimioprofilaxia, 4, 3 vezes na chance de DRC, 4, 7 vezes na chance de doença renal terminal e de 4, 8 vezes na chance de óbito); megaureter unilateral (aumento de 2, 9 vezes na chance de ITU); megaureter bilateral(aumento de 5, 9 vezes na chance de cirurgia, 7, 7 vezes na chance de HAS, 3, 5 vezes na chance de ITU, 3, 6 vezes na chance de ITU com quimioprofilaxia, 11, 8 vezes na chance de DRC, 17, 9 vezes na chance de doença renal terminal e de 14, 5 vezes na chance de óbito); megabexiga (aumento de 7, 9 vezes na chance de cirurgia, 10, 6 vezes na chance de HAS, 3, 9 vezes na chance de ITU, 4, 4 vezes na chance de ITU com quimioprofilaxia, 24, 7 vezes na chance de DRC, 35, 8 vezes na chance de doença renal terminal e de 15, 4 vezes na chance de óbito); oligodrâmnio (aumento de 6 vezes na chance de cirurgia, 4, 9 vezes na chance de ITU com quimioprofilaxia, 30 vezes na chance de DRC, 40 vezes na chance de doença renal terminal e de 14, 5 vezes na chance de óbito); hidronefrose unilateral com megaureter (aumento de 2, 9 vezes na chance de ITU e 2, 4 vezes na chance de ITU com quimioprofilaxia); hidronefrose bilateral com megaureter (aumento de 6, 8 vezes na chance de DRC, 10, 8 vezes na chance de doença renal terminal e de 13, 3 vezes na chance de óbito); hidronefrose bilateral com megaureter e megabexiga (aumento de 10, 8 vezes na chance de cirurgia, 12, 7 vezes na chance de HAS, 4 vezes na chance de ITU, 4, 3 vezes na chance de ITU com quimioprofilaxia, de 10, 1 vezes na chance de óbito, de 12, 2 vezes na chance de DRC e 15, 5 vezes na chance de doença renal terminal);hidronefrose bilateral com megabexiga e oligodramnio (aumento de 5, 2 vezes na chance de cirurgia, 23 vezes na chance de óbito, 150, 8 vezes na chance de DRC e de 93, 8 vezes na chance de doença renal terminal). Conclusão:Nosso estudo permitiu identificar os achados ultrassonográficos do sistema nefrourinário que se associam com redução ou com aumento da chance de desfechos clínicos desfavoráveis, em pacientes com CAKUT, permitindo melhor aconselhamento das gestantes. Background: Recent {{advances in}} obstetric ultrasound {{have led to}} early diagnosis of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) during antenatal care. Patients with CAKUT may present with unfavorable clinical outcomes thoroughout life. Objectives:this study aimed to associate antenatal nephrourinary ultrasonographic findings with clinical outcomes during postnatal period, childhood and adolescence, in patients with CAKUT. Patients and Methods:Retrospective cohort study of 823 patients with CAKUT seen at the Fetal Medicine Center of Hospital das Clínicas Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (HC-UFMG) and referred to the Pediatric Nephrology Unit of HC-UFMG after delivery. Median follow-up time was 58. 7 months. The nephrourinary ultrasonographic findings detected at the last exam prior delivery {{were associated with the}} need for surgical treatment, occurrence of urinary tract infection (UTI), urinary tract infection among patients on chemoprophylaxis, development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage chronic kidney disease (ESKD) and death. Pearson´s and Fisher´s exact chi-squared tests were used in the statistical analysis. Odds ratio was used to determine the prognostic value of the antenatal ultrasonographic findings. Results:In patients with CAKUT, the nephrourinary ultrasonographic findings that presented statistical significant association with the clinical outcomes, in comparison to patients with CAKUT without such findings were: unilateral hydronephrosis (reduction of 42. 5 % in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> UTI in patients on chemoprophylaxis, 82. 9 % in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> CKD, 89, 8 % in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> ESKD and 2. 8 % in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> death); unilateral isolated hydronephrosis (reduction of 57 % in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> UTI in patients on chemoprophylaxis, 89. 5 % in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> CKD, 87. 7 % in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> ESKD and 2. 5 % in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> death);bilateral isolated hydronephrosis (reduction of 30. 7 % in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> surgery and 90. 7 % in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> ESKD); unilateral renal cysts (66. 1 % reduction in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> surgery); bilateral hydronephrosis(1. 7 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> UTI in patients on chemopropylaxis, 4. 3 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> CKD, 4. 7 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> ESKD and 4. 8 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> death);unilateral megaureter (2. 9 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> UTI); bilateral megaureter (5. 9 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> surgery, 7. 7 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> hypertension, 3. 5 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> UTI, 3. 6 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> UTI in patients on prophylaxis, 11. 8 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> CKD, 17. 9 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> ESKD and 14. 5 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> death), megabladder(7. 9 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> surgery, 10. 6 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> hypertension, 3. 9 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> UTI, 4. 4 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> UTI in patients on prophylaxis, 24. 7 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> CDK, 35. 8 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> ESKD and 15. 4 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> death); oligohydramnio (6 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> surgery, 4. 9 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> UTI, 30 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> CKD, 40 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> ESKD and 14. 5 -fold in <b>chance</b> in <b>the</b> <b>of</b> death); unilateral hydronephrosis with megaureter (2. 9 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> CKD and 2. 4 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> UTI in patients on prophylaxis); bilateral hydronephrosis with megaureter (6. 8 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> CKD, 10. 8 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> ESKD and 13. 3 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> death);bilateral hydronephrosis with megaureter and megabladder (10. 8 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> surgery, 12. 7 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> hypertension, 4 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> UTI, 4. 3 - fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> UTI in patients on prophylaxis, 10. 1 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> death, 12. 2 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> CKD and 15. 5 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> ESKD); bilateral hydronephrosis with megabladder and oligohydramnio (5. 2 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> surgical treatment, 23 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> death, 150. 8 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> CKD and 93. 8 -fold increase in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> ESKD).
