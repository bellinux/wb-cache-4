30|$|Page 1 (Fig.  1 a) of {{the book}} {{features}} the above-mentioned glazed and striped callimanco swatches. The coating adds a distinctive, even glossy sheen to the textile, which emphasises the multiple colours. Contemporary reports describe the technique of applying the glaze by hotpressing, but the substance used to create the glossy surface remains unknown. To our knowledge, Beth Szuhay {{was the first person}} to pursue identification of this glazing substance as part of her independent study ‘Developing a Protocol for Analysis of <b>Textile</b> <b>Finishes</b> on Wool’ in 2000. By visual examination, scientific analysis and historical research she aimed to ‘develop a protocol for identification of the chemical components of <b>textile</b> <b>finishes</b> through analytical means.’ [9] Her spot tests and FTIR suggested the presence of a gum, and she acknowledged the need for ‘other confirmation techniques’. In our case, all FTIR spectra of water-soluble extracts of glazed samples showed two strong, broad bands, centred at around 1080 and 3300  cm− 1 due to C–O and O–H groups, respectively. A third characteristic band centred at approximately 1620  cm− 1, evinces intermolecular hydrogen bonds of water to a carboxyl group [65]. Altogether, these spectra strongly indicated the presence of a natural gum (Additional file 1 shows FTIR spectra). Subsequent extraction with chloroform suggested no non-polar components were present in the glaze.|$|R

5000|$|Decatising or decatizing, {{also known}} as crabbing, blowing, and decating, {{is the process of}} making {{permanent}} a <b>textile</b> <b>finish</b> on a cloth, so that it does not shrink during garment making.

Though used mainly for wool, the term is also applied to processes performed on fabrics of other fibers, such as cotton, linen or polyester. Crabbing and blowing are minor variations on the general process for wool, which is to roll the cloth onto a roller and blow steam through it.|$|R

The future of the textile industry is represented by the progress of new kinds of technical textiles, that are based on revolutionary technologies, innovative materials and utilization. This means developement of new products with high added-value properties, for example application of antimicrobial and UV-protective agents, fragrances, anti-cellulite treatments or skin softeners. Such <b>textile</b> <b>finishes</b> are both important commercial target and challenge for technical developement. This thesis focuses on the field of intelligent textiles and combination of textile and cosmetics. It digests agents, that are used and their effects and describes the principle of microencapsulation, which is a very important principle applied here...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. During {{conventional}} <b>finishing</b> <b>textile</b> processes it {{is necessary}} a big consumption both of water and energy. This aspects are is imposed by the development process of thermo and mass transfer of finishing agents into the textile structure materials applied in dentistry (fibers, yarns, fabric, nonwovens). The intensification of transfer processes into the textile materials is realized in conventional <b>finishing</b> <b>textile</b> industry (washing, cleaning, and coloring) by using high work temperature. The negative result of this intervention {{and the presence of}} chemical substances without degradation mean the environment pollution by the pour out residual water with a great quantity of toxic substances. The recently laboratory scientific research showed that the use of ultrasonic systems in <b>finishing</b> <b>textile</b> materials contributes both to the acceleration of thermo and mass transfer and to the decreasing of active chemical substances. In this way the paper presents a finishing system based on ultrasonic processes which is composed by modules and specific hardware components...|$|R
