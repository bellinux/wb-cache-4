5|$|I have then {{considered}} {{myself as}} a particle broken off from the grand mass of mankind; — I was alone, till some involuntary sympathetic emotion, like the attraction of adhesion, made me feel <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> {{a part of a}} mighty whole, from which I could not sever myself—not, perhaps, for the reflection has been carried very far, by snapping the thread of an existence which loses its charms in proportion as the cruel experience of life stops or poisons the current of the heart.|$|E
500|$|Rodham and Bill Clinton {{bought a}} house in Fayetteville in the summer of 1975 and she finally agreed to marry him. Their wedding took place on October 11, 1975, in a Methodist {{ceremony}} in their living room. A story about the marriage in the Arkansas Gazette indicated that she was retaining the name Hillary Rodham. The motivation was to keep the couple's professional lives separate and avoid apparent conflicts of interest and because, as she told a friend at the time, [...] "it showed <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> me." [...] The decision upset both of their more traditional mothers. Clinton had lost the congressional race in 1974, but in November 1976 was elected Arkansas Attorney General and so the couple moved to the state capital of Little Rock. There, in February 1977, Rodham joined the venerable Rose Law Firm, a bastion of Arkansan political and economic influence. She specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property law while also working pro bono in child advocacy; she rarely performed litigation work in court.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the San Diego Union {{at the start of the}} 1986 season, Boros assured Padres fans that he would not make extensive use of the computer as he had in Oakland. The resulting article noted:"At Oakland, Boros used computers extensively, studying percentages and tendencies to guide his strategic decisions, but at heart, he is a humanist. He would rather read a good baseball novel than a complex statistical analysis of the game. 'I found that players are very suspicious of computers, much like the general public,' he said. 'They fear them as cold and impersonal and inhuman. I couldn't make them understand <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> going to make my own decisions, I wasn't going to let the computer make them for me. I'm going to use some data and stats here, but we won't have a computer and a programmer in the clubhouse like we did in Oakland." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Walter!" [...] she whispered, [...] "my own darling! {{my heart}} is heavy for you. Oh, my son! my son! try to {{remember}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> left!" ...|$|R
6000|$|EVA. You tell me {{you have}} a lover. Will he not fly from you if he learn {{the story of my}} shame and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> living? ...|$|R
60|$|Another {{messenger}} now entered with word <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> {{within the}} palace walls.|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} my pale face abundantly {{justified}} the assertion <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> ill.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Oh, it was!' he said, doubtfully, evidently {{not believing}} {{me in the}} least, but {{considering}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> wandering in my mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "You and Miss Howard seem to {{know what}} you are talking about," [...] I {{observed}} coldly. [...] "Perhaps you don't realize <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> in the dark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} that you saved my life the other day, Monsieur Déroulède. <b>I</b> know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> in peril and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> owe my safety to you ..." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lestrade laughed. [...] "I <b>am</b> afraid <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> a sceptic," [...] he said. [...] "Theories are {{all very}} well, {{but we have to}} deal with a hard-headed British jury." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Most of them do--a {{good deal}} more. But Gulligan {{considered}} {{that he had}} taught me the business, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> under his thumb." ...|$|E
60|$|My surmise was not finished, {{could not}} be, for I caught {{sight in the}} mirror of the red mark upon my forehead, and I knew <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> unclean.|$|E
60|$|Now {{it was my}} turn to {{be unable}} to speak and to feel my eyes fill with tears, tears of rage, for {{remember}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> very feeble. But Marie spoke for me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] {{said the}} Colonel, [...] "that I must {{ask you to}} be more explicit. You must {{remember}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> most imperfectly acquainted with {{the rules of the}} club." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] {{continued}} Fanny,--and a deep blush {{covered her}} face as she spoke, [...] "I will write to Lord Ballindine, and tell him <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> his own if he chooses to take me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> do mean <b>that.</b> Though <b>I</b> do {{not know}} why I should come and tell you so,--except <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> blundering and stumbling, and have fallen into a way of hurting myself at every step." ...|$|R
60|$|You are not {{to suppose}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> the meek, sheepish lad {{who had come to}} Piacenza three months ago. I had not been {{learning}} my world and discovering Man to no purpose all this while.|$|E
60|$|But Sir Robert {{knew nothing}} of my design, that I aimed at being a kept mistress, {{and to have a}} {{handsome}} maintenance; and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> for getting money, and laying it up too, {{as much as he could}} desire me, only by a worse way.|$|E
60|$|We had now {{got into}} the month of March. My left arm, though it {{presented}} no bad symptoms, took, in the natural course, so long to heal <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> unable to get a coat on. My right arm was tolerably restored; disfigured, but fairly serviceable.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{needs no}} great power of speech to {{convince}} me of that," [...] said Erling. [...] "The fact <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> here, after what the King let out last night, convinces me, without your aid, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a fool." ...|$|R
5000|$|Finally, I got {{out from}} the {{drainage}} pipe which I could never escape all by myself. I feel really really lucky <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> alive {{like all the other}} people who came out from any catastrophes! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I salute you, Mrs Derry, and {{congratulate you}} both," [...] cried the young man, kissing the bride's fair cheek, [...] "and I rejoice to find <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> {{in time to}} dance at your wedding." ...|$|R
60|$|So saying, he {{shouldered}} his axe {{and went}} off; followed by Peterkin; while I {{took up the}} piece of newly discovered cloth, and fell to examining its structure. So engrossed was I in this <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> sitting in the same attitude and occupation when my companions returned.|$|E
60|$|I excused myself--professed illness--hinted {{that the}} wine {{had been too}} much for me. He laughed, with {{something}} of contempt as well as good-nature in the laugh; and went away to the play by himself evidently feeling <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> as bad a companion as he had found me at college, years ago.|$|E
60|$|The {{letter was}} dated {{from his house}} in London. It briefly invited me to call and see him, for a reason which I should hear from his own lips. He {{naturally}} supposed <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> at Sandwich, and requested me, in a postscript, to consider my journey as made at his expense.|$|E
6000|$|I {{replied in}} the same language, with a feeble voice, [...] "I believe I am; but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sorry <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> alive to feel this misery and horror." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, here I am," [...] {{she said}} presently, [...] "and {{in a very}} {{different}} dress from that in which you used to see me; but for all <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> a sister of the House of Martha, and so"-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can never}} love my husband--of <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> certain. <b>I</b> can never [...] leave off loving the other--of <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> more confident. Can [...] you advise me? Can you relieve me? This torture is too terrible. It [...] is killing me--killing me.|$|R
6000|$|... "By my old enemies, Watson. By {{the charming}} society whose leader {{lies in the}} Reichenbach Fall. You must {{remember}} that they knew, and only they knew, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> alive. Sooner or later they believed that I should come back to my rooms. They watched them continuously, and this morning they saw me arrive." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{went downstairs}} again {{to put out}} the lights in the dining-room. I noticed as I passed the {{sideboard}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> shaking a little. So I took a small drink of whisky--though as a rule I never care to take more than one drink--unless when I am sitting talking as we are here.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed," [...] she {{answered}} candidly, [...] "I {{knew nothing of}} the sort. How {{did you find out}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> on the ship, or that the ship was still above water? And even if you knew both, why should you risk your life just on the faint chance of rescuing a girl whom you never saw?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As to my principles,--that {{system of}} {{commerce}} which I have advocated,--as to <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> without a doubt. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{certain of the}} correctness of my views. Look at Barlywig and his colossal fortune, and 40,000l. a year spent in advertising." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{remember}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> greatly your debtor, {{and that}} if, at any future time, {{you should be}} in a position in which my aid may be useful, you have only to let me know, and I will stand your friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That'll {{be about}} all of that, Mr. Theriere," [...] snapped the first officer, coldly. [...] "I did not embark upon this {{theatrical}} enterprise for amusement--I see nothing funny in it, and I wish you to remember <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> your superior officer." ...|$|R
