5|$|Dr. Mario is {{a falling}} block tile-matching video {{game in which}} Mario assumes {{the role of a}} doctor, tossing two-colored medical {{capsules}} into a medicine bottle representing <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> <b>field.</b> This area is populated by viruses of three colors: red, yellow, and blue, which stay in their starting position until removed. In a manner and style considered similar to Tetris, the player manipulates each capsule as it vertically falls 1 unit of space at a time, able to move it left or right and rotate it 90 degrees in either clockwise or counter-clockwise. When four or more capsule halves or viruses of matching color are aligned in vertical or horizontal configurations, they are removed from play. Any remaining capsule halves or whole capsules which are now not supported by a virus or capsule will fall to the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> or until it hits another supported object, and any new 4-in-a-row alignments created from this will also be removed. The main objective is to complete levels, which is accomplished by eliminating all viruses from <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> <b>field.</b> A game over occurs if capsules fill up <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> in a way that obstructs the bottle's narrow neck. After each 5th level is completed on Medium or High difficulty, up to level 20, a cut-scene is shown where the virus trio is sitting on a tree as music plays and an object flies across the screen.|$|E
50|$|The {{game has}} the basic {{appearance}} of a conventional pinball game, with a rolling ball propelled upward on <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>field</b> by hitting it with flippers. However, unlike a conventional pinball game, <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>field</b> extends upwards endlessly. The display follows the ball as it moves. Multiple flippers are placed throughout <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>field.</b> There is no drain; play is limited by a timer. The challenge is {{to go as far}} as possible up <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>field,</b> within <b>the</b> available time.|$|R

5|$|At {{the climax}} of the event, a crate filled with disco records was blown up on the field between games of the twi-night doubleheader between the Chicago White Sox and the Detroit Tigers.

5|$|In August 1915, Spinks {{was tapped}} {{to join a}} consultative panel of notable players and major billiard hall proprietors to help develop a new handicapping system for balkline billiards, {{organized}} by the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company, {{at that time the}} organizers of the World Championships. The inspiration for the new system was simply making it possible for the newly ascendant Willie Hoppe to be meaningfully challenged – his near-unassailability was hurting billiard tournament revenues, because the outcome was considered foreordained by many potential ticket-buyers. The system was expected to level <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> in other ways, especially making it easier for skilled amateurs to enter the professional ranks.|$|E
5|$|In a {{gameplay}} mode {{exclusive to}} Western releases, the Arcade mode converts {{the game in}} a traditional fighting game, with all RPG elements removed and characters' abilities being stripped down to the basics to balance <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> <b>field.</b> Within the Arcade Mode, there are three tiers: Normal, Hard, and Time Attack; beating any tier of the Arcade mode will reward the player with PP (player points) and special items {{that can be used}} in story mode. All characters, including villains, are playable in Arcade mode; for example, Golbez, Sephiroth, Kuja, and Jecht are available for use in this mode from the start, but they still need to be bought via the PP Catalog for use in other modes.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the video arcade games, Sega Enterprises, Inc. (USA) created a Crazy Taxi themed redemption game which was released in 2003. The player had to roll their coin or token down the sloped playing surface past a moving taxi model {{in the center of}} <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> in order to hit one of eight targets (representing passengers) at the far end. Passengers were worth different points, from which the operator would then set the number of tickets to be won. The game incorporated music and sounds from the video games.|$|E

5|$|Martin was an {{integral}} member of the Cardinals' teams of the 1930s that {{became known as the}} Gashouse Gang for their roguish behavior and practical jokes. Early in his career, he was labeled by some contemporary press reports as the next Ty Cobb because of his spirited, hustling style of play. However, because his headlong attitude on <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> took a physical toll on his body, he never lived up to those initial expectations. After the end of his playing career, he continued his career in baseball as a successful minor league baseball manager.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh {{performance}} during the 1893 Home Nations Championship was {{in stark contrast}} to the previous year. Under the captaincy of Gould, Wales not only won the Championship for the first time, but also the Triple Crown. The first match of the campaign was against England, and played at the Cardiff Arms Park. The pitch had been kept from freezing over the night before by 500 braziers dispersed across <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> <b>field.</b> This led to a slippery ground, with play further hampered by a strong wind.|$|E

Both bullpens are located adjacent to section 103 behind right-center field, with the Indians' bullpen {{closer to the}} field. Like the majority of ballparks, the Indians' dugout is along the third base line and the visitors' dugout is located along the first base line. When the ballpark was built it contained 121 luxury boxes. A remodel and renovation between the 2014 and 2015 seasons removed six of them for a new total of 115, the second most in Major League Baseball.|$|E
5|$|The club spent £1,400 {{appointing}} {{designers to}} oversee the excavation and levelling of the land, and moved a one-year-old stand from Carlisle Road to the highest {{part of the new}} ground. The original ground comprised the relocated stand, a 2,000-capacity stepped enclosure with the players' changing rooms beneath the stand, the playing area, a cinder athletics track and fencing to limit the total capacity to 18,000. <b>The</b> <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> was made of ballast, ashes, soil and sods. The ground was officially opened on 27 September 1886 for a game against Wakefield Trinity which was watched by a capacity crowd, but construction work meant most of Manningham's early games were away fixtures.|$|E
5|$|The {{levels in}} And Yet It Moves are {{designed}} such that spinning {{the world at}} certain moments is required to progress.

Other hazards such as wild beasts, fire and boulders, or falling into the black void that borders <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> will tear the character. However, the player has unlimited lives and will reappear at the last checkpoint he passed prior to being torn.|$|E
