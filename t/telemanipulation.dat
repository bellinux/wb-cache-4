40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we present an {{approach}} to extending the capabilities of <b>telemanipulation</b> systems by intelligently augmenting a human operator’s motion commands based on quantitative three-dimensional scene perception at the remote <b>telemanipulation</b> site. This framework is the first prototype of the Augmented Shared-Control for Efficient, Natural Telemanipu-lation (ASCENT) System. ASCENT aims to enable new robotic applications in environments where task complexity precludes autonomous execution or where low-bandwidth and/or high-latency communication channels exist between the nearest human operator and the application site. These constraints can constrain the domain of <b>telemanipulation</b> to simple or static environments, reduce the effectiveness of <b>telemanipulation,</b> and even preclude remote intervention entirely. ASCENT is a semi-autonomous framework that increases the speed and accuracy of a human operator’s actions via seamless transitions between one-to-one teleoperation and autonomous interventions. We report the promising results of a pilot study validating ASCENT in a transatlantic <b>telemanipulation</b> experiment between The Johns Hopkins University in Balti-more, MD, USA and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. In these experiments, we observed average telemetry delays of 200 ms, and average video delays of 2 s with peaks of up to 6 s for all data.

To the authors’ best knowledge, {{it is the first}} attempt to integrate mobile and multi-robot strategies in one physical and logical framework. In order to exploit human manipulation capabilities, a high fidelity <b>telemanipulation</b> system was developed. It consists of two redundant human-scaled anthropomorphic telemanipulator arms controlled by two redundant haptic interfaces providing a large, convex workspace and force feedback {{in a wide range of}} human perception. To provide a multi modal immersion, the haptic modality is augmented by 3 D visual and audio channels. The main research issues are the control of devices with dissimilar kinematics, redundancy resolution methods, and six DOF compliance control.

40|$|Abstract — Combining teletaction {{systems with}} <b>telemanipulation</b> systems {{promises}} to enhance task performance when interacting with remote environments. However, the force scaling {{inherent in the}} <b>telemanipulation</b> system affects {{the ability of the}} user to control the exploration force. The quality of the tactile signal is therefore impacted, affecting performance in tasks that benefit from spatially distributed force information. We compare performance localizing an embedded lump in a compliant environment using a telemanipulated teletaction system versus a directly manipulated teletaction system. Lump localization accuracy was found to be the same; however, time required to localize the lump was up to 150 % longer for the <b>telemanipulation</b> trials. Based upon our results, we conclude that the ability to maintain an appropriate force in the remote enviroment is necessary {{to take full advantage of}} the spatially distributed force information from the tactile sensor.

40|$|In {{bilateral}} <b>telemanipulation</b> algorithms {{based on}} enforcing time-domain passivity, internal friction in the devices poses an additional energy drain. This can severely decrease the obtainable transparency of these algorithms when high amounts of friction {{are present in}} the slave device.

Extending the energy balance which is monitored, decreases the net passivity of the <b>telemanipulation</b> system enforced by the control algorithm, which usually enforces passivity of just the bilateral controller. Experimental results are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of the pro- posed approach in increasing the obtainable transparency. As long as the physically dissipated energy is underestimated, the <b>telemanipulation</b> system as a whole will remain passive. Thus the guaranteed sta- bility property of the time-domain passivity algorithm is maintained...|$|E

We tested a new computer-assisted <b>telemanipulation</b> robot (Intuitive Surgical Inc, Mountain View, Calif) in performing endoscopic coronary bypass. Methods: On-bench anastomoses of the porcine arterial graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery were performed with both direct visualization and conventional surgical instruments (group I), endoscopic 3 -dimensional visualization and current endoscopic surgical instruments (group II), direct visualization and endoscopic instruments (group III), 3 -dimensional endoscopic visualization and conventional surgical instruments (group IV), and <b>telemanipulation</b> robotic with 3 -dimensional endoscopic visualization (group V). Anastomoses (n = 6 in each group) were assessed for time (minutes), quality (good = 3, fair = 2, poor = 1), technical difficulty (easy-difficult: 1 - 4), and patency (100 % = 1, > 50 % = 2, < 50 % = 3). Results: Anastomotic time was significantly longer in groups II and III than in groups IV and V (P ≤. 02). Patency was comparable in all groups.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses three related {{topics in}} the application of virtual fix-tures to bilateral <b>telemanipulation</b> systems. Bilateral <b>telemanipulation</b> is the direct human control of a remote robot, with force and/or tactile feedback, and virtual fixtures are guidance modes, implemented in software, that assist the user in ac-complishing a telemanipulated task. The first topic addressed in this dissertation is the design of functional and stable forbidden-region virtual fixtures, which prevent robot motion into forbidden-regions of the workspace. Metrics are defined to evalu-ate the effectiveness of forbidden-region virtual fixtures, and a human-factors exper-iment uses these metrics to quantify how users interact with various combinations of forbidden-region virtual fixtures and <b>telemanipulation</b> control system. A method to predict system stability that incorporates an explicit model of the telemanipulator and bounding models of human users is created and experimentally verified. Next, a new condition is presented for the passivity of a virtual wall with sampling, sensor quantization, and friction effects, for an impedance-type robot. This condition i...|$|E
40|$|A {{bilateral}} telemanipulator is {{a robotic}} {{system that allows}} the interaction with remote environments and it is composed by a controlled local robot (the master) and a controlled remote robot (the slave) interconnected through a communication channel. The motion imposed to the master by the human is transmitted to the slave which moves accordingly; when the slave interacts with a remote environment, the interaction force is fed back to the master side {{in order to improve}} the perception of the remote environment felt by the user. Passivity theory is a very suitable tool for the implementation of bilateral <b>telemanipulation</b> schemes over delayed communication channels. In passivity based <b>telemanipulation,</b> both master and slave are controlled by means of passive impedance controllers and master and slave sides are interconnected through a scattering based communication channel [1, 8] which allows an exchange of information which is passive independently of any constant communication delay. In this way, the overall <b>telemanipulation</b> system is passive and, consequently, its behavior is stable both in case of free motion and in case of interaction with any passive environment. In [12, 11], a generic framework for geometric <b>telemanipulation</b> of port-Hamiltonian systems [13] has been proposed; master and slave are interconnected through intrinsically passive port-Hamiltonian impedance controllers which allow to shape the energetic behavior of the robots and to achieve desired dynamic properties at master and slave sides.

40|$|The complex, nonintuitive {{kinematics}} of concentric tube robots (CTRs) {{can make}} their <b>telemanipulation</b> challenging. Collaborative control schemes that guide the operating clinician via repulsive and attractive force feedback based on intraoperative path planning can simplify this task. Computationally efficient algorithms, however, are required to perform rapid path planning and solve the inverse kinematics of the robot at interactive rates. Until now, ensuring stable and collision free robot configurations required long periods of precomputation to establish kinematic look-up tables. This article presents a high-performance robot kinematics software architecture, which is used together with a multinode computational framework to rapidly calculate dense path plans for safe <b>telemanipulation</b> of unstable CTRs. The proposed software architecture enables on-the-fly, incremental, inverse-kinematics estimation at interactive rates, and it is tailored to modern computing architectures with efficient multicore central processing units (CPUs). The effectiveness of the architecture is quantified with computational-complexity metrics and a clinically demanding simulation inspired from neurosurgery for hydrocephalus treatment.

40|$|International audienceRobotic {{teleoperation}} in cluttered environments {{is attracting}} increasing attention for its potential in hazardous scenarios, disaster response, and telemaintenance. Although haptic feedback {{has been proven}} effective in such applications, commercially-available grounded haptic interfaces still show significant limitations in terms of workspace, safety, transparency, and encumbrance. For this reason, we present a novel robotic teleoperation system with wearable haptic feedback for <b>telemanipulation</b> in cluttered environments. The slave system is composed of a soft robotic hand attached to a 6 -axis force sensor, which is fixed to a 6 -degrees-of-freedom robotic arm. The master system is composed of two wearable vibrotactile armbands and a Leap Motion. The armbands are worn on the upper arm and forearm, and convey information about collisions on the robotic arm and hand, respectively.
