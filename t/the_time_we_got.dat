I think there were six deckies, four firemen, one engineer, one wireless operator and the master and mate. The galley was right aft with the mess room beneath.

[...] Microsoft was able to provide additional programmers to help during 2006 to correct the problems, just in time to create a demo for the 2006 E3 Convention.

500|$|The {{end of each}} issue, {{with the}} {{exception}} of issue twelve, contains supplemental prose pieces written by Moore. Among the contents are fictional book chapters, letters, reports, and articles written by various Watchmen characters. DC had trouble selling ad space in issues of Watchmen, which left an extra eight to nine pages per issue. DC planned to insert house ads and a longer letters column to fill the space, but editor Len Wein felt this would be unfair to anyone who wrote in during the last four issues of the series. He decided to use the extra pages to fill out the series' backstory. Moore said, [...] "By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> around to issue #3, #4, and so on, we thought that the book looked nice without a letters page. It looks less like a comic book, so we stuck with it." ...|$|E

While Westmore estimated that a fully staffed production would have around 50 makeup artists, First Contact had to make do with fewer than ten people involved in preparation, and at most 20 artists a day. Despite the long hours, Westmore's teams began to be more creative with the prosthetics even as they decreased their preparation times. [...] "They were using two tubes, and then they were using three tubes, and then they were sticking tubes in the ears and up the nose," [...] Westmore explained. [...] "And we were using a very gooey caramel coloring, maybe using a little bit of it, but by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to the end of the movie we had the stuff dripping down the side of [...] faces—it looked like they were leaking oil!

We have to earn that. The audience needs to understand who all of these characters are and what the world is before you then start co-mingling". In September 2015, Feige elaborated on the films referencing the television series, saying [...] "I think that's inevitable at some point ... The schedules do not always quite match up to make that possible. It's easier for [...] They're more nimble and faster and produce things quicker than we do, which is one of the main reasons you see the repercussions of Winter Soldier or [...] in the show ... by the time we start doing a movie, they'd be mid-way through a season.

500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN graded {{the episode}} 8.1 out of 10, calling it [...] "pretty damn busy and quite fun", {{highlighting}} Skye's character {{development and the}} drama it caused, {{as well as the}} connections to [...] "Pilot", as high points of the episode. He praised the [...] "dark, but also necessary" [...] deaths depicted, and concluded that the series [...] "is beginning to build its story in an intriguing way." [...] James Hunt at Den of Geek found the episode to be [...] "mostly, quite good," [...] praising Skye's story, the idea that S.H.I.E.L.D. [...] "might actually be as bad as the people they're trying to fight", and the character of Raina, who he called [...] "the closest thing this series has yet had to an original, interesting idea". Hunt criticized the dialogue, and found the character of Chan Ho Yin to be unrealistic, stating [...] "while I loved the fact that they kind of, sort of, dredged up an actual Marvel character to use in this episode ... it was a shame that he too bore almost no resemblance to an actual person". The Guardians Graeme Virtue also criticized some of the dialogue, but enjoyed the character of Raina and the potential for her to return. He hoped that now Skye's secret has been revealed, [...] "perhaps some of the other agents will get their time in the spotlight." [...] Marc Bernardin of The Hollywood Reporter decided that the [...] "episode wasn't as good as [...] "Eye Spy"—by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to the last two segments, I really didn’t care what happened to “Scorch,”—but it was still better than the first three. It was all just so very ... perfunctory." ...|$|E
500|$|The team {{failed to}} throw a {{touchdown}} pass in any of their first five games, three of which were shutout losses. Offensive coordinator John Rauch walked out on the team during the week 5 game against Cincinnati, and gave 'personal differences' {{as the reason for}} his resignation. His duties were taken over by McKay, who pointed to the increased effectiveness of the team’s “simpler” offense, saying that they were no longer “trying to do all the things people said you have to do in this league”. On a strange NFL weekend in which O.J. Simpson was ejected from a game for fighting, the Chicago Bears lost a game due to a referee’s inadvertent whistle, and Minnesota Vikings receiver Sammy White fumbled away a touchdown due to starting his celebration before entering the end zone, McKay launched an obscenity-filled tirade against Denver Broncos coach John Ralston after a blowout loss. McKay admitted that his feelings dated back to their college rivalry, when McKay coached at USC and Ralston coached at Stanford University, but pointed to specific plays such as a reverse and a last-minute punt return as evidence that Ralston was trying to run up the score. Third-string running back Manfred Moore caught a lucky break when, waived after the week 13 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he was picked up by the Oakland Raiders as an injury replacement for ex-Buccaneer Rick Jennings. He wound up going from an 0–13 team to the eventual Super Bowl champion. Players began to meet for postgame parties at Steve Spurrier’s house, in order to avoid having to show their faces in public. According to defensive end Pat Toomay, “By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to the last game of the season, we had so many injuries that we didn’t feel we had much of a chance. Everybody was so sick of the season that they showed up packed and ready to get out of town. It looked like a bunch of Okies fleeing the dust bowl." [...] McKay said that the week 4 game against the Baltimore Colts summed up the season: “On one play I looked up and one of our guys was getting kicked out of the game, and two more were getting carried off”.|$|E

[...] He was assigned in March 1943 to active duty at the Marine Corps Base in San Diego. With his Coast Guard service, he was offered a position as an officer, but Ford declined, feeling it would be interpreted as preferential treatment for a movie star and instead entered the Marines as a private. He trained at the Marine base in San Diego, where Tyrone Power, the number-one male movie star at the time, was also based. Power suggested Ford join him in the Marine's weekly radio show, Halls of Montezuma broadcast Sunday evenings from San Diego. [...] Ford excelled in his training, winning the Rifle Marksman Badge and named [...] "Honor Man" [...] of the platoon and promoted to sergeant {{by the time he}} finished.|$|E

[...] "When the pictures of the '65 Corvair arrived in our offices, the man who opened the envelope actually let out a great shout of delight and amazement on first seeing the car, and in thirty seconds the whole staff was charging around, each wanting {{to be the first to}} show somebody else, each wanting the vicarious kick of hearing that characteristic war-whoop from the first-time viewer." [...] "Our ardor had cooled a little by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to drive the cars— then we went nuts all over again. The new rear suspension, the new softer spring rates in front, the bigger brakes, the addition of some more power, all these factors had us driving around like idiots— zooming around the handling loop dragging with each other, standing on the brakes— until we had to reluctantly turn the car over to some other impatient journalist...
