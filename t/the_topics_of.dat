5|$|Ancient Athens, of the 6th century BC, was {{the busy}} trade centre at the {{confluence}} of Egyptian, Mesopotamian and Minoan cultures {{at the height of}} Greek colonisation of the Mediterranean.

The physician Hippocrates (460370 BC) avoided the prevailing superstition of his day and approached healing by close observation and the test of experience.
