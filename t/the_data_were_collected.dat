An experiment sampling 117 mother–child pairs showed a unique relationship between the mother's sensitivity {{and the use of}} discipline and the child's temperament level. Observations (of the mother's sensitivity to the child's needs, the child's aggression and temperament level and the relationship between the two) were made when the children on average were 26.71 months old (range of 13.58 to 41.91 months). <b>The</b> <b>data</b> <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> again a year later.

2500|$|A 2001 {{study in}} the journal Stroke found that vertebrobasilar {{accidents}} (VBAs) were five times more likely in those aged less than 45 years who had visited a chiropractor in the preceding week, compared to controls who had not visited a chiropractor. No significant associations were found for those over 45 years. The authors concluded: [...] "While our analysis {{is consistent with a}} positive association in young adults... The rarity of VBAs makes this association difficult to study despite high volumes of chiropractic treatment." [...] The NHS notes that this study collected data objectively by using administrative data, involving less recall bias than survey studies, but <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> retrospectively and probably contained inaccuracies.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{complaints}} {{about the use of}} migrant workers, the Act does not require that contractors show that workers engaged are local residents, but rather requires that laborers be paid the local prevailing wage. Due to the way <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> at that time and {{due to the fact that}} construction trades were heavily unionized at that time by craft unions, “prevailing wage” effectively meant “union journeyman wage” as discussed above. Unions operate by negotiating for higher wages, and then working to restrict those eligible for the higher wages to union membership. Craft unions did not admit black apprentices, and therefore black laborers did not have the opportunity to advance to journeyman status. According to Bernstein, “as of 1940 blacks composed 19 percent of the 435,000 unskilled [...] "construction laborers" [...] in the United States and 45 percent of the 87,060 in the South”, and according to Hill, [...] "the increase of Negro participation in building trades apprenticeship training programs rose only from 1.5% to 2%" [...] in New York between 1950 and 1960. Furthermore, Hill pointed out that [...] "ecause the National Labor Relations Board has done little to enforce the anti-closed shop provisions of the Taft Hartley Act, building trades unions affiliated to the AFL-CIO in most instances are closed unions operating closed shops". Therefore, the requirements and mechanisms of the Davis–Bacon Act necessarily prevented black laborers from participating in federally funded construction projects. “According to a study on youth and minority employment published by the Congressional Joint Economic Committee on July 6, 1977, Davis–Bacon wage requirements discourage nonunion contractors from bidding on Federal construction work, thus harming minority and young workers who are more likely to work in the nonunionized sector of the construction industry.” Thus, even if racism was not the intent, racial discrimination was a result of the law.|$|E
