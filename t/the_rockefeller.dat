5|$|Following {{the rise}} of {{classical}} genetics, many biologists—including {{a new wave of}} physical scientists in biology—pursued the question of the gene and its physical nature. Warren Weaver—head of the science division of <b>the</b> <b>Rockefeller</b> Foundation—issued grants to promote research that applied the methods of physics and chemistry to basic biological problems, coining the term molecular biology for this approach in 1938; many of the significant biological breakthroughs of the 1930s and 1940s were funded by <b>the</b> <b>Rockefeller</b> Foundation.|$|E

Phelps Way ends at the northeastern tip of the park, where NY117 intersects with the northern terminus of NY448 at Bedford Road. While NY448 ends here, Bedford Road continues on as part of NY117.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rockefellers</b> {{trace their}} patrilineal line to Goddard Rockefeller (born Gotthard Rockenfeller) (1590) of Fahr, today part of Neuwied, Germany. <b>The</b> first <b>Rockefeller</b> {{to settle in}} America (1723) was Johann Peter Rockenfeller (1710, Segendorf, Neuwied; 1787, Amwell Township, New Jersey), who {{changed his name to}} Rockefeller. Godfrey Lewis Rockefeller was a son of distant cousins William Rockefeller (1750-1793) and Christina Rockefeller (1754-1800).|$|R

5|$|On Gates' advice, Rockefeller {{became one}} of the first great benefactors of medical science. In 1901, he founded <b>the</b> <b>Rockefeller</b> Institute for Medical Research in New York City. It changed its name to Rockefeller University in 1965, after {{expanding}} its mission to include graduate education. It claims a connection to 23 Nobel laureates. He founded <b>the</b> <b>Rockefeller</b> Sanitary Commission in 1909, an organization that eventually eradicated the hookworm disease, which had long plagued rural areas of the American South. His General Education Board made a dramatic impact by funding the recommendations of the Flexner Report of 1910. The study had been undertaken by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.|$|E
5|$|Rockefeller's fourth main philanthropy, the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Foundation, {{was created}} in 1918.

5|$|The {{portion of}} NY117's {{original}} routing between Tarrytown and Pleasantville {{passed through the}} center of Kykuit, the estate of <b>the</b> <b>Rockefeller</b> family, and was designed to handle 1,900 cars per day. The actual volume of traffic on the roadway was much higher as the actual average annual daily traffic reached upwards of 5,000 vehicles per day. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>Rockefeller</b> family looked into having the route realigned as early as 1932. The family suggested that a new highway be built along the northern end of the estate.|$|E

50|$|According to the New York Times <b>the</b> <b>Rockefellers</b> first pioneered family {{offices in}} the late 19th century.

5000|$|Most of the {{furnishings}} {{placed in the}} house following the 1974 renovation were twentieth century copies of either colonial or Federal style pieces.

Called the [...] "cage" [...] bed, the headboard had {{the form of a}} Greek pediment, and the baseboard a lower version of a pediment. Sculptural foliage similar to olive or laurel leaves wrapped around the posts. The seal of the Vice President of the United States was incorporated into <b>the</b> headboard. <b>The</b> <b>Rockefellers</b> twice offered <b>the</b> bed permanently to the house but it was turned down both by Vice President George H. W. Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle. On visiting Barbara Bush at <b>the</b> house, Mrs. <b>Rockefeller</b> offered her <b>the</b> bed, and Mrs. Bush responded [...] "you are always welcome in this house, but there's no need to bring your own bed." [...] <b>The</b> <b>Rockefellers</b> did leave a lithograph called [...] "The Great Ignoramus," [...] several antique Korean and Japanese chests, and nearly a dozen other pieces.|$|R
