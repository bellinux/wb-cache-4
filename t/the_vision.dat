30|$|These visions {{provide a}} unique {{opportunity}} to examine European citizen sentiments and values concerning the future because the citizen involvement methodology applied to create <b>the</b> <b>visions</b> and <b>the</b> format of <b>the</b> <b>visions</b> have been uniform in the conducted European involvement projects. The task of producing comprehensive analyses of <b>the</b> <b>visions</b> has however proven to be arduous. This is partly due to the rich character of <b>the</b> <b>visions</b> in <b>the</b> sense that each vision may relate to a number of topics, making <b>the</b> <b>visions</b> hard to categorise. Furthermore, an established methodology for analysing <b>the</b> <b>visions</b> has not emerged yet, which has prevented <b>the</b> analysis of <b>visions</b> across projects. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>visions</b> have been analysed inductively and qualitatively within each project, thus connecting <b>the</b> <b>visions</b> to project procedures rather than to comparative methodologies [9]. The lack of an established methodology for cross-project analysis has also prevented the reflection or the positioning of new sets of citizen <b>visions</b> against <b>the</b> previously produced ones.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Visions.</b> <b>The</b> <b>visions</b> {{are first}} given to Doyle, then pass to Cordelia and finally {{make their way}} to Angel. The Powers send roughly 30 <b>visions</b> over <b>the</b> course of <b>the</b> series. <b>The</b> <b>visions</b> tend to have double meanings. There is a micro-purpose and macro-purpose to each <b>vision.</b> For instance, <b>the</b> Powers' first <b>vision</b> tells Doyle that [...] "we have a common enemy." [...] On a micro scale, the Powers mean the Scourge. On a macro scale, they mean the Senior Partners or evil itself. While helping people, <b>the</b> <b>visions</b> tend to make Angel meet the right people who are useful to plans and prophecies later. However, <b>the</b> <b>visions</b> {{typically}} cause <b>the</b> bearer great pain, and only demons or those with demonic heritage can bear them without suffering long-term damage.|$|R
5000|$|Jean Starcky {{was first}} to believe that <b>the</b> <b>Visions</b> fall under a {{testament}} because of the multiple similarities with the Testament of Levi. [...] Here scholars compared the introductory narrative of <b>the</b> <b>Visions</b> of Amram with the introductory sections of the Testaments of the 12 Patriarchs, most specifically the Testament of Levi. [...] Officially, Milik {{was the first to}} call <b>the</b> <b>Visions</b> of Amram a testament.|$|R

50|$|Unlike earlier {{religious}} revivals {{based on}} powerful preaching, {{the revival of}} 1904 - 05 relied primarily on music and on alleged supernatural phenomena as exemplified by <b>the</b> <b>visions</b> of Evan Roberts. The intellectual emphasis of the earlier revivals had left a dearth of religious imagery that <b>the</b> <b>visions</b> supplied. <b>The</b> <b>visions</b> also challenged <b>the</b> denial of the spiritual and miraculous element of Scripture by opponents of the revival, who held liberal and critical theological positions. The structure and content of <b>the</b> <b>visions</b> not only repeated those of Scripture and earlier Christian mystical tradition but also illuminated the personal and social tensions that the revival addressed by juxtaposing Biblical images with scenes familiar to contemporary Welsh believers.|$|R

5|$|The {{scene where}} Saul Tigh has <b>the</b> <b>vision</b> of {{shooting}} William Adama was not filmed in one shot, but was edited {{in such a}} way that the cut would only become noticeable if one looks at the scene closely.

For Randy, <b>the</b> <b>visions</b> involve his abusive father.

5|$|A {{week before}} her death, Mary {{went through her}} papers, weeding out some which were burnt, but her journal survives, as do her letters to William and to Frances Apsley. The Jacobites lambasted her, but the {{assessment}} of her character that came down to posterity was largely <b>the</b> <b>vision</b> of Mary as a dutiful, submissive wife, who assumed power reluctantly, exercised it with considerable ability when necessary, and willingly deferred it to her husband.|$|E
5|$|Bran Stark and the Three-eyed Raven {{observe a}} vision of the Children of the Forest {{creating}} the Night King by impaling a man with a dragonglass dagger. Bran subsequently confronts Leaf, one of the Children, about creating the White Walkers. She explains that they were at war with the First Men, and had no choice. Bran decides to observe a vision without the Three-Eyed Raven. He witnesses a massive army of wights led by the Night King, who touches him whilst in <b>the</b> <b>vision.</b> Bran awakens to find a mark where he was touched, and the Three-Eyed Raven warns that he must leave, as the Night King is now able to find them.|$|E
5|$|Bran Stark, Meera Reed, and Benjen Stark arrive {{near the}} Wall. Benjen takes his leave, {{stating that the}} Wall's magical {{protection}} prevents the dead (and therefore, him) {{from being able to}} pass. Meera assists Bran to a weirwood tree and he re-enters <b>the</b> <b>vision</b> of Eddard Stark at the Tower of Joy. Ned finds his sister Lyanna Stark covered in blood from childbirth. With her dying breath, Lyanna pleads with Ned {{to take care of her}} son, who is revealed to be Jon Snow.|$|E
30|$|Visions {{concerning}} {{digital technology}} related mainly to technical skills and resources. <b>The</b> <b>visions</b> were emerging; most teachers shared them, but <b>the</b> <b>visions</b> were not fully clear in teachers’ minds.

5|$|Critics who {{admire his}} middle work might {{characterize}} it as supple and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist, while others find these poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeats's later work found new imaginative inspiration in the mystical system {{he began to}} work out for himself {{under the influence of}} spiritualism. In many ways, this poetry is a return to <b>the</b> <b>vision</b> of his earlier work. The opposition between the worldly minded man of the sword and the spiritually minded man of God, the theme of The Wanderings of Oisin, is reproduced in A Dialogue Between Self and Soul.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his time}} in prison, A.I.M {{scientists}} converted Osborn into a Super-Adaptoid, capable of absorbing the abilities of any mutant, mutate, alien, android or other such super powered being by touching them. In this form he possessed considerably increased strength and durability; where he was once approximately as strong as Spider-Man, he now possessed sufficient strength to overpower and throw Luke Cage a significant distance away from him. He could also levitate, {{and he was able}} to defeat <b>the</b> <b>Vision</b> in an aerial conflict between the two.|$|E
5|$|For centuries, in {{accordance}} with <b>the</b> <b>vision</b> of Zeami, Noh costumes emulated the clothing that the characters would genuinely wear, such as the formal robes for a courtier and the street clothing for a peasant or commoner. But in the late sixteenth century, the costumes became stylized with certain symbolic and stylistic conventions. During the Edo (Tokugawa) period, the elaborate robes given to actors by noblemen and samurai in the Muromachi period were developed as costumes.|$|E
