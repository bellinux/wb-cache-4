5|$|Although the Belgian White Brigade, the 11th Armoured Division, and {{elements}} of the British 3rd Infantry Division had entered Antwerp as early as 6September, taking the city and docks, a strategic oversight meant that the nearby bridges over the Albert Canal were not seized, leaving the Germans {{in control of the}} Scheldt estuary. The failure to make an immediate push on the estuary ensured the strategically vital port would remain useless until the Scheldt was cleared. Strong formations of the German Fifteenth Army, which had withdrawn from the Pas de Calais, were able to consolidate <b>their</b> <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> the islands of South Beveland and Walcheren, as well as the Albert Canal directly northwest of Antwerp, and were further reinforced by elements of General Kurt Student's First Parachute Army.|$|E
5|$|Beginning at 4:30am on March 10, North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces {{proceeded}} {{to capture the}} following targets: the VPA 38th Regiment overran the highpoints of Nui Vu, Nui Ngoc, Duong Con, Soui Da and Nui Vy; the 36th Regiment destroyed South Vietnamese strong points at Trung Lien, Mount Da, Mount Khong ten, Ho Bach and Hill-215; the Viet Cong ‘Ba Gia’ Regiment held <b>their</b> <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> Hill-269 and Hill-310, to stop South Vietnamese counter-attacks from Tuan Duong; while the 52nd Independent Brigade captured Go Han, Phuoc Tien, Duong Ong Luu, Duong Huế, Nui My, Hon Nhon, Deo Lieu, and Mount Đất Đỏ. Thus, 23 positions held by units of the ARVN 12th Ranger Groups were captured, just after four hours of fighting.|$|E

5|$|In early 1974, {{the group}} Americans for Democratic Action rated Mathias {{the most liberal}} member of the GOP in the Senate based on twenty key votes in the 1973 {{legislative}} session. At 90 percent, his score was higher than most Democrats in the Senate, and was fourth highest amongst all members. Issues considered when rating senators included <b>their</b> <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> civil rights, mass transit, D.C. home rule, tax reform, and reducing overseas troop levels. The League of Women Voters gave Mathias a 100% on issues important to them, and the AFL-CIO agreed with Mathias on 32 out of 45 key labor votes. Conversely, the conservative group Americans for Constitutional Action stated Mathias agreed with their positions only 16% of the time.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Battle of Cape Esperance, the Japanese Army opted to reinforce <b>their</b> <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> Guadalcanal. To protect their transport convoy from enemy air attack, Admiral Yamamoto sent Haruna and Kongō, escorted by one light cruiser and nine destroyers, to bombard Henderson Field. Because of their high speed, the two battleships could bombard the field and withdraw before being subjected to air attack from aircraft carriers. On the night of 13–14 October, the two battleships shelled Henderson Field from a distance of , firing 973 14-inch shells. In the most successful Japanese battleship action of the war, the bombardment heavily damaged both runways, destroyed almost all available aviation fuel, incapacitated 48 of the airfield's 90 aircraft, and killed 41 men. The Japanese troop convoy reached the island the next day.|$|E
5|$|Responding to the Japanese {{capture of}} part of the ridgeline, Major Odell M. Conoley—Hanneken's {{battalion}} executive officer—quickly gathered a counterattack unit of 17 men, including communications specialists, messmen, a cook, and a bandsman. Conoley's scratch force was joined by elements of Hanneken's Company G, Company C, and a few unwounded survivors from Company F and attacked the Japanese before they could consolidate <b>their</b> <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> top of the ridge. By 06:00, Conoley's force had pushed the Japanese back off the ridge, effectively ending Oka's attack. The Marines counted 98 Japanese bodies on the ridge and 200 more in the ravine in front of it. Hanneken's unit suffered 14 killed and 32 wounded.|$|E

5|$|South Korean forces, meanwhile, had emplaced in {{the wrong}} position, a mile too far south, and were not in contact with 19th Infantry. The South Korean forces were {{subsequently}} hit with friendly and enemy fire, and in the confusion the 19th Infantry attempted to block the South Koreans from advancing, thinking them enemy forces. North Korean snipers were able to infiltrate {{the rear of the}} position and kill five UN soldiers with shots {{to the back of the}} head. However American forces repelled several advances on the right flank. The M4 Shermans gave the American force a superiority in armor over the North Koreans for the first time, and were crucial in pushing back each attempted North Korean advance. North Korean infantry, unsupported by armor of their own, suffered heavy casualties from the American forces in <b>their</b> <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> the high ground.|$|E
5|$|When the Chetnik leaders {{appointed}} by Draža Mihailović, Majors Boško Todorović and Dangić, {{became aware of}} the commencement of Operation Southeast Croatia, they advised other Chetnik commanders that the operation was targeted at the Partisans, and {{there was no need for}} the Chetniks to get involved. Following this, their units withdrew from <b>their</b> <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> the front line, let the Germans pass through their areas, or went home. Many withdrew across the Drina into German-occupied Serbia to avoid being engaged, which severely weakened the Partisan defences with the result that they suffered significant casualties and lost a great deal of territory. These actions severed any remaining cooperative links that remained between the Chetniks and Partisans in eastern Bosnia.|$|E
5|$|Within {{ten minutes}} of the first shot, Junons top deck was almost {{completely}} cleared and Shortland had been taken below, his leg broken by grapeshot and his body pierced by several large wooden splinters. Lieutenant Samuel Bartlett Deecker assumed command, and successfully beat off a boarding attack from Clorinde. Pulling Junon clear off the two full-strength French frigates, Deecker tried to escape but found his ship unresponsive. Within minutes, Roquebert and Saint-Cricq had regained <b>their</b> <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> {{either side of the}} British frigate and boarded simultaneously, forcing Deecker to surrender at 18:15. The British had suffered heavy losses, with 20 killed and 40 wounded, including Shortland. The prisoners were dispersed among the French squadron and rather than spare the men required to repair and crew the battered Junon, Roquebert had the frigate set on fire and abandoned. French losses were also severe, Renommée losing 15 killed and three wounded and Clorinde six killed and 15 wounded. Loire, Seine, and HMS Observateur suffered no losses at all.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the loss}} of <b>their</b> <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> {{the east side of the}} Matanikau, the Japanese decided that an attack on the U.S. {{defenses}} along the coast would be prohibitively difficult. Thus, after observation of the American defences around Lunga Point by his staff officers, Hyakutake decided that the main thrust of his planned attack would be from south of Henderson Field. His 2nd Division (augmented by one regiment from 38th Division), under Lieutenant General Masao Maruyama and comprising 7,000 soldiers in three infantry regiments of three battalions each was ordered to march through the jungle and attack the American defences from the south near the east bank of the Lunga River. The 2nd Division was split into three units; the Left Wing Unit under Major General Yumio Nasu containing the 29th Infantry Regiment, the Right Wing Unit under Major General Kiyotake Kawaguchi consisting of the 230th Infantry Regiment (from the 38th Infantry Division), and the division reserve led by Maruyama comprising the 16th Infantry Regiment. The date of the attack was set for 22 October. To distract the Americans from the planned attack from the south, Hyakutake's heavy artillery plus five battalions of infantry (about 2,900 men) under Major General Tadashi Sumiyoshi were to attack the American defenses from the west along the coastal corridor. The Japanese estimated that there were 10,000 American troops on the island, when in fact there were about 23,000.|$|E
5|$|Between 1 October and 17 October, the Japanese {{delivered}} 15,000 {{troops to}} Guadalcanal, giving Hyakutake 20,000 total troops to employ for his planned offensive.

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to halt the North Vietnamese assault, Luat ordered two squadrons of M-113 {{armoured}} personnel carriers to confront the enemy at Nga Sau, but {{they were forced to}} turn back by tanks from the North Vietnamese 3rd Tank Battalion, 273rd Armoured Regiment. At around 5:30pm, a South Vietnamese ranger battalion was forced to abandon the nearby installation at Dac Lac after continuous assaults from the 95B Regiment. In the northeast, the South Vietnamese 9th Ranger Battalion held off the North Vietnamese 95B Regiment until they abandoned <b>their</b> <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> the next day. In the western outskirts of Ban Me Thuot, eight A-37 Dragonfly bombers from the South Vietnamese 6th Air Force Division inflicted light casualties on the North Vietnamese 24th Regiment, but failed to stop their enemies’ momentum. In the southwest, Quang tried to retake Mai Hac De by mobilising his reserve units with tactical air support. Meanwhile, in the south-eastern end of Ban Me Thuot, the North Vietnamese 149th Regiment defeated the South Vietnamese 53rd Infantry Regiment, after they sustained heavy casualties from repeated air attacks from A-37 bombers.|$|E
5|$|On July 22 the North Koreans attacked. The ROK troops {{resisted}} briefly, but {{withdrew from}} <b>their</b> <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> {{either side of}} F Company without communicating their intentions. The withdrawal had {{been a part of}} the plan for reorganizing the line to incorporate the US troops, but F Company expected them to send a message before doing so, and did not adjust their defenses to compensate. North Korean troops quickly flanked F Company and began attacking it from the rear. This precipitated an unorganized withdrawal. The swollen stream prevented F Company from crossing to the south side and the 2nd Battalion positions. Walking wounded crowded along the stream where an effort to get them across failed. Two officers and two noncommissioned officers tied a pair of twisted telephone wires about their bodies and tried to swim to the other bank and fasten a line, but each in turn was swept downstream where they floundered ashore on the same bank where they had started. Some men drowned trying to cross the swollen river. The covering fire of a platoon of tanks on the south side held off the North Koreans and allowed most of the survivors to eventually escape. F Company lost 37 men: 6 killed, 10 wounded, and 21 missing.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of March 12, elements of the ARVN 23rd Infantry Division were dropped off at designated landing zones around Phuoc An. Initially about 100 South Vietnamese helicopters participated in the operation, and 81 fighter-bombers were deployed to strike at North Vietnamese positions to cover the landings. At 3:10pm, Phu took off in his Cessna U-17 to direct the operation over the skies of Ban Me Thuot. As he approached the battlefield, Phu phoned the South Vietnamese units at Hoa Binh airfield to notify them that an operation was underway, and he encouraged the soldiers {{to hold on to}} <b>their</b> <b>positions.</b> <b>On</b> the morning of March 13, another 145 helicopters were used to complete {{the first phase of the}} operation with the entire 44th Infantry Regiment, the last soldiers of the 45th Infantry Regiment, and the 232nd Artillery Battalion dropped off at various points in Nong Trai, Phuoc An and along Highway 21. At the completion of the landing operation, Phu returned to Pleiku to have a meeting with Thieu, during which they discussed the sudden appearance of the North Vietnamese 316th Infantry Division.|$|E

The next day, August 28, North Korean attacks continued. That day, a North Korean company-sized attack struck between C and I Companies before dawn. That night, North Korean mortar fire fell on C Company on Battle Mountain. After midnight, a North Korean infantry force appeared in the rear area and captured the command post. Some men of C Company left <b>their</b> <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> Battle Mountain without firing when the attack began at 02:45 the next morning, August 29. The North Koreans then directed their attack toward E Company and overran part of its positions. Airdrops after daylight kept C Company supplied with ammunition, and a curtain of artillery fire, sealing off approaches from the North Koreans' main positions prevented substantial reinforcements from entering the fight. All day on August 29, artillery fire and air strikes racked the North Koreans occupying E Company's old positions. Then, in the evening, E Company counterattacked and reoccupied the lost ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} did {{not take}} part in any fighting until {{a few months later}} when, in January 1943, it took part in the defence of Wau after the 17th Brigade was despatched to reinforce Kanga Force. Sailing to Port Moresby from Milne Bay on the MV Duntroon, an advance party of two companies from the battalion was flown into Wau on 24 January to hastily reinforce the small force around Ballams. The remainder– totalling about 450 men– arriving on 29 January, after which they secured the airfield, which was now under direct Japanese fire, as the two companies that had arrived earlier were pulled back from Ballams. In early February, as the Australians gained the initiative, the battalion was relieved from holding the airfield, and went on the offensive, attacking alongside the 2/7th Battalion, in an effort to push the Japanese away from <b>their</b> <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> the bank of the Bulolo River, around Crystal Creek, to the south-west of Wau. The fighting was intense, and over the course of three days, the battalion lost 27 killed and 31 wounded.|$|E
5|$|The initial VC attack {{had split}} allied {{formations}} within the garrison; the 1st and 2nd Platoons of the 11th MSF Company were {{pushed away from}} the eastern perimeter, while the Marines were either alone or had organized themselves into small groups of two or three, but none were in contact with each another. Meanwhile, from inside his command post, White called in air-support which later {{came in the form of}} an AC-47 Spooky gunship, a modified version of the C-47 Skytrain equipped with 7.62mm General Electric miniguns for the support of ground troops. On the eastern side of the garrison, VC soldiers of the 40th Battalion continued to charge up the hill firing their AK-47 assault rifles. Simultaneously, other elements of the VC 1st Regiment probed the southern and western end of the garrison, now held by Captain White's 1st and 3rd Platoons, to test the strength of allied defenses in that part of the garrison. By that stage, however, most Nung soldiers had retreated from <b>their</b> <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> the eastern end of the garrison, while the U.S. Marines were pinned down around the perimeters. By 03:30, the VC had captured the Marines' gun position. Captain White was able to maintain contact with Warrant Officers Cameron and Lucas through telephone, but they could not coordinate their forces.|$|E
