40|$|Background: Tolnidamine-induced {{changes have}} been {{reported}} earlier on spermatogenesis, fertilityand sperm count in rat, rabbit and langur monkey. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the response ofthese aspects to <b>tolnidamine</b> in the laboratory mouse. Materials and Methods: Adult male mice (12 - 14 weeks old) of Parkes (P) strain were used inthe present study. All the animals were divided into five groups. Groups I, II and V were takenas untreated, vehicle-treated initial and vehicle-treated terminal controls, respectively. Meanwhile,animals of Group III were administered with <b>tolnidamine</b> (100 mg/kg BW, twice a week) orally for 3, 5 and 7 weeks and killed 24 hrs. after the last injection. Animals of Group IV were administeredwith the same dose of the <b>tolnidamine</b> for 7 weeks and then sacrificed 5 and 7 weeks after withdrawalof the drug. Tolnidamine-induced changes were evaluated on spermatogenesis, motility and countof epididymal spermatozoa, fertility and accessory sex glands and compared with the untreated andvehicle-treated controls. Results: <b>Tolnidamine</b> treatment induced significant decrease in the weights of the testis andepididymis; however, the weights of the accessory sex glands remained unaltered following thetreatment. Duration-dependent degenerative changes were noticed in the testicular germinalepithelium showing vacuolization and loosening of the germ cells and Sertoli cells. Percentagemotility and count of epididymal spermatozoa declined significantly following administration oftolnidamine. Likewise fertility of the treated males as well as number of the live blastocysts infemales impregnated with such males also exhibited a significant decrease when compared with thecontrols. However, no change was noticed in the mating ability of the mice treated with <b>tolnidamine.</b> The level of seminal vesicular fructose also remained unaltered after the treatment. Withdrawalstudies revealed duration-dependent recovery in spermatogenesis, percentage motility and count ofspermatozoa and fertility. Conclusion: The findings of the present study, therefore, reveal that tonidamine administration inP mice induces reversible inhibition of spermatogenesis, motility and count of spermatozoa andfertility without affecting the androgen-dependent parameters...|$|E
