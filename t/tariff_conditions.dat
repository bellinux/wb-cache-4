The article justifies difficulties of formation of groups by payment for labour {{on the basis of}} the traditional procedure of labour tariffication. It formulates “grade” and “grading” definitions. It specifies specific features of planning basic wage with the use of the grading procedure. It studies approaches to planning the basic wage used at Ukrainian enterprises. It establishes that the most widely used is the traditional approach to development of <b>tariff</b> <b>conditions</b> of payment for labour. It justifies that planning the basic wage with the use of the grading procedure allows increase fairness in payment for labour, increase individualisation of wages due to the fact that the process of identification of size of remuneration takes into account value of the position (work), level of the worker’s professionally significant competences and individual results of labour.

In general, the university has high peak ambient temperature of around 32 – 35 °C coupled with high humidity of about 85 % during afternoon period. The total electricity charge for the Universiti Malaysia Sarawak Campus is very high amounting to more than $ 314, 911 per month. In this paper, a few district cooling schemes are investigated to provide “what-if analysis” {{and in order to}} minimize the overall electricity charges. Few scenarios designed for the application of centrifugal with and without ice-thermal storage (ITS) systems on the buildings were investigated. It was found that, due to the local tariff status, marginally saving can be achieved in the range of 0. 08 – 3. 13 % if a new tariff is adopted; and a total of further saving of 1. 26 – 2. 43 % if ITS is operated.

40|$|In Northern China, due to {{the high}} {{penetration}} of coal-fired cogeneration facilities, which are generally equipped with extraction-condensing steam turbines, lots of wind power resources may be wasted during the heating season. In contrast, considerable coal is consumed in the power generation sector. In this article, firstly it is revealed that there exists a serious divergence in the ratio of electrical to thermal energy between end users’ demand and the cogenerations’ production during off-peak load at night, which may negate active power-balancing of the electric power grid. Secondly, {{with respect to this}} divergence only occurring during off-peak load at night, a temporary proposal is given so as to enable the integration of more wind power. The authors suggest that if the energy carrier for part of the end users’ space heating is switched from heating water to electricity (e. g., electric heat pumps (EHPs) can provide space heating in the domestic sector), the ratio of electricity to heating water load should be adjusted to optimize the power dispatch between cogeneration units and wind turbines, resulting in fuel conservation. With this proposal, existing infrastructures are made full use of, and no additional ones are required. Finally a numerical simulation is performed in order to illustrate both the technical and economic feasibility of the aforementioned proposal, under ongoing infrastructures as well as electricity and space heating <b>tariff</b> <b>conditions</b> without changing participants’ benefits. The authors aim to persuade Chinese policy makers to enable EHPs to provide space heating to enable the integration of more wind power...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analysis aimed {{to evaluate the}} feasibility of micro-CHP systems to meet household energy demands of a single family user. The considered CHP systems are based on innovative technologies, which are already available on the market or {{will be available in}} the short-term period, and that have an electric power output suitable for a single family user, i. e. the electric power must be close to a few kW. The considered technologies (micro gas turbines, micro Rankine cycles, Stirling engines and thermophotovoltaic generators) are compared to the internal combustion engine, which is currently the only well-established technology for small size CHP. For two single-family dwellings, characterized by different floor areas and shape factors, a specific certification of energy performance was carried out, to estimate yearly energy requirements. Daily profiles of electric, thermal and cooling loads are instead estimated by using literature data. Five CHP systems are considered, which are composed of (i) a prime mover (internal combustion engine, micro gas turbine, micro Rankine cycle, Stirling engine or thermophotovoltaic generator), (ii) a thermal energy storage unit and (iii) an auxiliary boiler used to cover peak thermal demands which cannot be met by both the CHP unit and the thermal energy storage unit. The energy performance, in terms of primary energy saving, and the maximum cost allowed for each CHP system are evaluated, to identify the most suitable technology, prime mover and thermal energy storage unit size. For this purpose, the influence of specific <b>tariff</b> <b>conditions</b> in the present market scenario is evaluated thoroughly...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of polygeneration systems, {{in terms of}} profitability, energy saving and pollutant emissions reduction, highly depends on several factors such as plant efficiency, local normative and <b>tariff</b> <b>conditions</b> and reference technologies adopted to compare the results. In Part I of this paper a reliable tool was described, capable of optimizing the lay-out, design and operation of an integrated polygeneration system serving a cluster of buildings with their heat, cooling and power demand; the tool represents an excellent instrument to perform sensitivity analyses, thus enabling the analyst to formulate general design criteria and predict the effects of {{any change in the}} boundary conditions or in the normative provisions concerning support mechanisms for polygeneration plants. In this Part II of the paper, with reference to a cluster of four buildings located over a small area, once assumed a fixed topology of the site (in terms of distance between buildings) the sensitivity of plant design and operation is investigated, posing a particular focus on some context conditions: (1) the minimum primary energy saving imposed for the ‘‘high efficient cogeneration’’ assessment, (2) the reference efficiency of ‘‘separate power production’’ systems adopted to evaluate energy savings, (3) the local energy prices and (4) the incidence of tax exemption for the fuel consumed by polygeneration plants. The sensitivity analyses are preceded by an accurate study on the robustness of solutions, performed by assuming different widths of the temporal basis adopted for the optimization. The proposed study offers a comprehensive view and interesting insights as concerns the viability of polygeneration systems for buildings applications...|$|E

50|$|Nepal {{is another}} {{landlocked}} country with extreme dependency on its transit neighbour India. India {{does not have}} poor relations with Nepal, nor does it lack relevant transport infrastructure or internal stability. In the 1970s, Nepal suffered from large commodity concentration and a high geographic centralization in its export trade: over 98% of its exports were to India, and 90% of its imports came from India. As {{a result of all}} this, Nepal had a poor trade bargaining position. In the 1950s, Nepal was forced to comply with India's external tariffs as well as the prices of India's exports. This was problematic since the two countries have different levels of development, resulting in greater gains for India which was larger, more advanced and with more resources. It was feared that a parasitic relationship might emerge, since India had a head start in industrialization, and dominated Nepal in manufacturing, which could reduce Nepal to being just a supplier of raw materials. Because of these problems, and Nepal's inability to develop its own infant industries (as it could not compete with Indian manufactures) treaties were drafted in 1960 and 1971, with amendments to the equal <b>tariffs</b> <b>conditions,</b> and terms of trade have since progressed.|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis {{is to make a}} design and {{comparative}} analysis of different solar cell technologies (Polycrystalline, Monocrystalline, Thin-Film CIS, Thin-Film A-Si and Multi- Junction) of a 3 MW PV grid connected system that located in Meitar Israel. The comparative analysis considers the area, the cost, the LCOE (Levelized cost of energy) and the payback. The main procedure of this thesis was divided into four parts. The first part presents the technical and legislation requirements of Israel, this part has explained the laws to install a PV system and the tariffs. The second part shows the geographical situation and the meteorological data of Meitar, which has included presentation of the village, the solar irradiation during the year and the ambient temperature. The third part shows the component selection of the different PV systems. This part has included a carefully study in order to choose the most correctly and the financially modules and inverters for the systems. The last part shows the sizing and the simulation of the different PV systems. This part has presented the necessary number of modules and inverters, the total necessary area and the economic analysis for each system. The simulation of the different PV systems was done by the software PVsyst. This software has a wide database of the meteorological data including the global solar irradiation, diffuse irradiation and the ambient temperature during the year. Also, there is a database of the solar energy components from various manufacturers. After the analysis {{of the results of the}} different PV systems, it was possible to see which cell technology will be preferable for this system. First, was made a comparison of the necessary area between the different PV systems. Second, was made an economic analysis in order to see which cell technology will be the most financially, including calculations of the LCOE and payback of each PV system. After the analysis of the results the polycrystalline technology has shown superiority on the rest. That means, the installation of the grid connected PV system with the Polycrystalline technology will return the investment faster and will produce electricity with the lower price and with the higher returns compare to the other PV systems. At the <b>tariff</b> <b>conditions</b> in Israel the installation of this PV system will be very financially due to the high feed-in tariff regarding the electricity production from PV systems...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} limits of {{international}} trade cooperation {{in the presence of}} a dispute settlement procedure. The dispute settlement procedure is modeled as set of conditions imposed on the punishment equilibria of a repeated <b>tariff</b> game, <b>conditions</b> that are consistent with the WTO principles of conciliation and reciprocity. The resulting equilibria are "renegotiation-proof" in the sense of Pearce (1987). We find that tariff agreements cannot achieve free trade in the presence of the dispute settlement procedure, although the cost of this limitation becomes small for high discount factors. Quota agreements can achieve free trade under the dispute settlement procedure; however, countries would always prefer to settle disputes with tariff sanctions, if given a choice. These results are related to recent dispute settlement reforms...|$|R

40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of a Wireless Sensor Networks based Smart Grid for home utility system for power utility has been presented in this thesis. The system utilises wireless power monitoring devices and control units. The electronic wireless power monitoring devices {{have been designed to}} monitor electrical parameters such as voltage, current and power of the household appliances. The measured electrical parameters are transmitted to a central controller via the ZigBee node. The central coordinator has been configured around a laptop computer and receives all the transmitted data from different nodes. The computer stores the measured data and analyses them. The computer is also connected to internet and the website of the electrical power supply company is accessed. The real-time electricity tariff is available to the controller. Based on the <b>tariff</b> <b>condition</b> the controller can determine the off-peak and peak-electricity rate. The controller can decide to switch off the unimportant electrical loads at peak-tariff situation. This is implemented by sending the necessary command to the zigbee node connected to the appropriate load. The zigbee node can then switch off the load by sending an off-command to the triac which is used as the control device. The user has the options of controlling the electrical appliances in different modes. If the users would like to continue the load to be on during the peak-tariff condition, the option of a manual switch can be used to bypass the triac. The appropriate electrical loads can be monitored as well as controlled using the developed GUI available at the laptop. The complete information of the system is also available through a website and appropriate control action can be implemented through a secured access. The objective of the research is to lower the consumption of power during the peak-tariff condition and thereby saves electricity cost. A prototype has been designed, developed and extensively tested. This Thesis presents the current work, experimental results and concludes with possible future research opportunities...|$|R

The model has been applied to a paper mill which utilises pass-out turbines for cogeneration of electricity and process steam. Results indicate that savings in fuel costs of the order of 400, 000 dollars per year could be obtained by implementing optimal strategies for operating the present turbines. Savings of the order of one million dollars per year could be obtained by converting the turbines to give high pressure pass-out steam and then operating optimally. ...|$|R
40|$|Loyalty {{discounts}} are nonlinear <b>tariffs</b> that <b>condition</b> rebates or marginal {{prices on}} meeting aggregate purchase or market share targets.

This paper models the competitive effects of {{the introduction of a}} GPO into a market within which the preferences of the GPO's members are horizontally differentiated. While nonlinear tariffs are an effective way for a monopolist to extract consumer surplus, when two suppliers compete using such schedules, the results are far more competitive in comparison to simple Bertrand–Nash competition with linear tariffs. This result holds when the product of each of the suppliers is attractive to a substantial portion of consumers. In our model, the nonlinear schedule puts all customers “in play ” to a degree that contrasts sharply with the competition at the margin characteristic of constant per unit prices. Moreover, competing in nonlinear tariffs removes allocative inefficiency that can result from single price competition...|$|R
40|$|The {{format of}} pricing {{contracts}} varies substantially across business contexts, a major variable being whether a contract imposes a fixed fee payment. This paper examines how {{the use of}} the fixed fee in pricing contracts affects market outcomes of a manufacturer-retailer channel. Standard economic theories predict that channel efficiency increases with the introduction of the fixed fee and is invariant to its framing. We conduct a laboratory experiment to test these predictions. Surprisingly, the introduction of the fixed fee fails to increase channel efficiency. Moreover, the framing of the fixed fee does make a difference: an opaque frame as quantity discounts achieves higher channel efficiency than a salient frame as a two-part tariff, although these two contractual formats are theoretically equivalent. To account for these anomalies, we generalize the standard economic model by allowing the retailer's utilities to be reference dependent so that the up-front fixed fee payment is perceived as a loss and the subsequent retail profits as a gain. We embed this reference-dependent utility function in a quantal response equilibrium framework where the retailer is allowed to make decision mistakes due to computational complexity. The key prediction of this behavioral model is that channel efficiency decreases with loss aversion for sufficiently Nash-rational retailers. Consistent with this prediction, the estimated loss-aversion coefficient is 1. 37 in the two-part <b>tariff</b> <b>condition,</b> significantly higher than 1. 27 in the quantity discount condition. At the same time, loss aversion dominates contract complexity in explaining the data. Lastly, we conduct a follow-up experiment to confirm the central role of loss aversion as a behavioral driver. In one condition, the retailer becomes less loss averse when we temporally compress the fixed fee payment and the realization of retail profits, which supports the loss aversion theory. In the other condition, the retailer's contract acceptance rate does not decline when we reward the manufacturer a higher cash payment for each experimental point earned, which rules out the competing hypothesis that the retailer rejects contract offers due to fairness concerns. fixed fee, two-part tariffs, quantity discounts, distribution channels, loss aversion, behavioral economics, experimental economics...|$|R

Every day people involved in diverse activities travel between both cities. Current conditions indicate that the people traveling between the two cities are served by 2 modes of transportation, i. e. public inter-city/inter-province (AKAP) bus services and domestic airlines operating daily. In his study, the favored transportation modes used to travel between both cities were analyzed by applying stated preference and  discrete choice modeling to find the service attributes and variables that have the most significant influence on the traveler’s satisfaction when using both alternative transportation modes. After analyzing the data collected from a total of 100 randomly selected persons with the stated preference approach, one of the results obtained was: Umode i = 1. 723 + 2, 618 T - 0, 004 C + 7, 180 VT, which means that value of time (VT) affected traveler satisfaction significantly more than attributes such as total travel time (T) and total cost of the trip (C). Therefore, the probability of air transportation to be used for traveling the route Padang-Jakarta is larger (52 %) than that of the alternative transportation mode (AKAP public bus). This means that the providers of both modes of transportation, airlines and AKAP public bus services, should focus their attention on timeliness of departure, departure frequency and delay minimization while maintaining the other attributes of their service, such as affordable <b>tariffs,</b> fleet <b>condition,</b> as well as others.   Keywords.
