5|$|In aikido, as in {{virtually}} all Japanese martial arts, there are both physical and mental aspects of training. The physical training in aikido is diverse, covering both general physical fitness and conditioning, as well as specific techniques. Because {{a substantial portion of}} any aikido curriculum consists of <b>throws,</b> beginners learn how to safely fall or roll. The specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs; the techniques for defense consist of <b>throws</b> and pins. After basic techniques are learned, students study freestyle defense against multiple opponents, and techniques with weapons.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{availability}} of the simplified tasks for the step-by-step practice of the judo <b>throwing</b> techniques. Participants were 12 college students who have attended the national College judo tournaments and the 16 principal <b>throwing</b> techniques were employed for the experiments. The simplified tasks of the <b>throwing</b> techniques were designed based on the opponent’s postures that were one knee and half sitting. Participants were asked to <b>throw</b> the opponents who assumed two kinds of the postures by 16 <b>throwing</b> techniques. 4 kinds of Taisabaki, which meant how to move legs, were used for the <b>throwing</b> trials. Binomial tests were conducted and results demonstrated that both the <b>throwing</b> tasks to one knee and the <b>throwing</b> tasks to half sitting were available for 9 <b>throwing</b> techniques. Neither the <b>throwing</b> tasks to one knee nor the <b>throwing</b> tasks to half sitting were available for 2 <b>throwing</b> techniques. The <b>throwing</b> tasks to one knee were not available, but the <b>throwing</b> tasks to half-sitting were available for 5 <b>throwing</b> techniques. Furthermore, appropriate Taisabaki was considered for each of the <b>throwing</b> techniques. The findings of this study would contribute to devise appropriate ways and means of judo practice for novices...|$|R

5|$|The radio postgame show {{reported}} the Warriors defeating the Knicks 169–150. However, the official scorer's report recorded {{the game as}} 169–147, a discrepancy {{that has never been}} explained. Chamberlain made 36 of 63 field-goals and 28 of 32 free <b>throws,</b> the latter a far better rate than his roughly 50% career average. In two earlier games at Hershey that season, Chamberlain had made a combined 27of38 free <b>throws,</b> 71percent. The basket rims at the arena were aged, flimsy, and forgiving. Balls would bounce off of typical firm rims, whereas balls near the rim in Hershey were apt to get a good roll and fall in. Playing all 48minutes of the game, Chamberlain set NBA records for field goals attempted (63) and made (36), free <b>throws</b> made (28), most points in a quarter (31), and half (59). He averaged 73points in four games that week, exceeding 60 in all of them.|$|E

Kansas failed to score again, and this time Kearns missed his shot after being fouled, but then made both free <b>throws.</b> Off of a pass from Loneski, Chamberlain made a shot, was fouled, and made the ensuing free throw to complete the three-point play and bring the Jayhawks within one point. Cunningham was fouled after being trapped in a double team and then missed the first shot of the one-and-one. The Jayhawks' Loneski missed a contested, close layup, but King got the offensive rebound and was fouled on a put back shot. King made one of the free <b>throws</b> and tied the score at 5252.|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to clarify the possibility of progress of <b>throwing</b> ability on adult females, and to examine effective instructional methods of <b>throwing.</b> Twenty-four female students who had no special experiences of motor learning of <b>throwing</b> were divided into three groups; two training groups (WI group: <b>throwing</b> exercise with verbal instruction and demonstration, and NI group: <b>throwing</b> exercise without instruction) and one control group. Training was carried out three days per week for four weeks. Measuring physical fitness and analyzing <b>throwing</b> motions were performed before and after the training period. In the WI group, <b>throwing</b> distance increased significantly from 24. 38 m to 30. 38 m. Actions of arm and legs during preparatory phase of <b>throwing</b> were changed, consequently factors of action at starting of main phase of <b>throwing</b> were also changed. It seemed that these changes leaded to faster forward rotation of shoulder during main phase of <b>throwing,</b> skillful whip-like action and wrist action. In the NI group, <b>throwing</b> distance increased from 24. 67 m to 27. 17 m insignificantly. Remarkable changes of <b>throwing</b> motions were not recognized except for the increase of range of shoulder rotation.
