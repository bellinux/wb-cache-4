50|$|A {{track circuit}} {{typically}} has power applied to each rail and a relay coil wired across them. When no train is present, <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> <b>is</b> <b>energised</b> {{by the current}} flowing from the power source through the rails. When a train is present, its axles short (shunt) the rails together; the current to the track relay coil drops, and it is de-energised. Circuits through the relay contacts therefore report {{whether or not the}} track is occupied.|$|E
50|$|Trap {{points or}} catch points are {{designed}} to intentionally derail vehicles making an unauthorised movement. When a vehicle derails completely, its wheels cease to shunt the track circuit. Since the vehicle might still be foul of the track, {{it is important to}} maintain the track circuit in the 'occupied' state. To achieve this, a cast iron interrupter is fitted to one of the run-off rails such that it will be struck by the wheels of a vehicle that is about to be derailed. Since the track circuit is bonded via the interrupter, it is proved to be intact when <b>the</b> track circuit <b>relay</b> <b>is</b> <b>energised.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{ignition}} key controls the normal expected functions of accessories, ignition circuit and starting. When the {{ignition key}} is momentarily {{moved to the}} start position the main traction battery <b>relay</b> <b>is</b> <b>energised</b> (causing a clunk) which allows the accelerator to move the vehicle as normal. The function of the ignition switch is slightly different from regular cars as only the stop light and the handbrake light (if the handbrake is applied) are displayed. On other cars all the indicator lights are shown to check bulb condition.|$|R
50|$|Since <b>relays</b> <b>are</b> switches, <b>the</b> {{terminology}} {{applied to}} switches is also applied to relays; a relay switches {{one or more}} poles, each of whose contacts can be thrown by energizing the coil. Normally open (NO) contacts connect the circuit when <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> <b>is</b> activated; <b>the</b> circuit <b>is</b> disconnected when <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> <b>is</b> inactive. Normally closed (NC) contacts disconnect the circuit when <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> <b>is</b> activated; <b>the</b> circuit <b>is</b> connected when <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> <b>is</b> inactive. All of the contact forms involve combinations of NO and NC connections.|$|R
50|$|In some countries, AC-immune DC track {{circuits}} are used on AC electrified lines. This is the predominant method of track circuiting on overhead electrified {{parts of the}} UK rail network. One method provides 5 V DC to the rails, one of the rails being the traction return and the other being the signal rail. When a <b>relay</b> <b>is</b> <b>energised</b> and attached to the track, normal voltage is 5 V DC. When there is {{a break in the}} circuit and there is no train, the voltage rises to 9 V DC which provides a very good means for fault finding. This system filters out the voltage induced in the rails from the overhead lines. These {{track circuits}} are limited in length to about 300m.|$|R

50|$|The {{simplest}} type of {{burglar alarm}} control {{consists of a}} single relay. In this type, the sensor circuit (called the loop in industrial terminology) holds <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> energized. Since <b>the</b> path for the loop goes {{through a set of}} contacts which are normally open (when <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> <b>is</b> restored they <b>are</b> open, when <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> <b>is</b> energized they are closed), when the loop opens, even momentarily, <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> will drop out and stay that way. A second set of contacts on <b>the</b> <b>relay,</b> normally closed (when <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> <b>is</b> restored they <b>are</b> closed, when <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> <b>is</b> energized they are open) is used to operate the annunciator, usually a bell. The system is disarmed by a key-operated shunt which forces <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> to energize, and is armed by closing all traps and then by opening the shunt. While burglar alarm controls are now very elaborate, the single-relay control incorporates all the functionality of any control. These controls and a closely related dual-relay design are still widely used in stand-alone applications, powered by lead-acid batteries.|$|R

30|$|Let us {{assume that}} <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> <b>is</b> unable to {{calculate}} γ {{before the end}} nodes design their precoders. Certainly, this means that <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> <b>is</b> unable to know what precoders the end nodes will choose without some signaling from the end nodes—if it knew the precoders, it could simply solve (3) and get γ. Consequently, γ or the information needed to calculate γ must <b>be</b> signaled to <b>the</b> <b>relay.</b>|$|R
30|$|Moreover, {{the results}} in Figure 7 also {{indicate}} that the AF protocol outperforms the DF protocol when <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> <b>is</b> 20 m away from the PR, but it yields a lower performance when <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> <b>is</b> located in <b>the</b> middle between the PT and the PR. This {{is due to the}} fact that when <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> <b>is</b> nearer to <b>the</b> PR, the loss caused by the amplified noise power when <b>relaying</b> <b>the</b> message based on the AF protocol is lower than that caused by the outage probability constraint from the primary user when decoding the message in the DF protocol, and this cost becomes a little higher when <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> located in <b>the</b> middle between the PT and the PR.|$|R

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>relays</b> <b>are</b> DF <b>relays,</b> {{in which}} case a <b>relay</b> fully decodes <b>the</b> data from the base station before {{forwarding}} to <b>the</b> users. <b>The</b> <b>relay</b> applies uniform transmit power on all subcarriers, schedules the users on selected resource blocks, applies modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and re-transmits on the access link.
