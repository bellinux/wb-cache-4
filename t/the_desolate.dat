5|$|The {{desert is}} {{generally}} {{thought of as}} a barren and empty landscape. It has been portrayed by writers, film-makers, philosophers, artists and critics as a place of extremes, a metaphor for anything from death, war or religion to the primitive past or <b>the</b> <b>desolate</b> future.|$|E
5|$|Elcor was {{a mining}} location, {{built by the}} mining company to house the workers for its mines. People were allowed to own their homes, but the land on which the houses stood belonged to the mining company. After the Corsica mine closed in 1954, Pickands Mather and Company ordered the {{residents}} to vacate the property {{so that it could}} reclaim the land; by 1956, Elcor was completely abandoned. <b>The</b> <b>desolate</b> property changed hands often through acquisitions, mergers and bankruptcies. In 1993 the Inland Steel Company began stripping the overburden from Elcor's former location for what is now the Minorca mine.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>desolate</b> Ikana Canyon, to {{the east}} of Clock Town, is the site of a former kingdom. It is {{inhabited}} mainly by the undead, except for a ghost researcher and his daughter Pamela, as well as a thief named Sakon. A pair of giant masked insectoid serpents known as Twinmold from their nest in Stone Tower Temple are casting a dark aura over the land, causing the dead bodies of former citizens and soldiers to come back to life as undead monsters.|$|E

5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the Hyksos and the reunification of Egypt under Ahmose I, the Theban rulers began to {{construct}} elaborate tombs that reflected their newfound power. The tombs of Ahmose and his son Amenhotep I (their exact location remains unknown) were probably in the Seventeenth Dynasty necropolis of Dra' Abu el-Naga'. The first royal tombs in the valley were those of Amenhotep I (although this identification is also disputed), and Thutmose I, whose advisor, Ineni, notes in his tomb that he advised the king to place his tomb in <b>the</b> <b>desolate</b> valley (the identity of this actual tomb is unclear, but it is probably KV20 or KV38).|$|E
5|$|Billions {{of years}} ago, beings called the Guardians of the Universe used the green essence of willpower {{to create an}} intergalactic police force called the Green Lantern Corps. They divided the {{universe}} into 3600 sectors, with one Green Lantern per sector. One such Green Lantern, Abin Sur of Sector 2814, defeated the malevolent being Parallax and imprisoned him in the Lost Sector on <b>the</b> <b>desolate</b> planet Ryut. In the present day, Parallax escapes from his prison after becoming strengthened by an encounter with crash survivors on the planet, feeding on their fear to gain strength before pursuing and nearly killing Abin Sur, who escapes and crash-lands on Earth where he commands his power ring to find a worthy successor.|$|E
5|$|Long {{thought to}} be related to frigatebirds, cormorants, tropicbirds, gannets and boobies, {{pelicans}} instead are now known to be most closely related to the shoebill and hamerkop, and are placed in the order Pelecaniformes. Ibises, spoonbills, herons and <b>the</b> <b>desolate</b> bitterns have been classified in the same order. Fossil evidence of pelicans dates back to at least 30 million years to the remains of a beak very similar to that of modern species recovered from Oligocene strata in France. They are thought to have evolved in the Old World and spread into the Americas; this is reflected in the relationships within the genus as the eight species divide into Old World and New World lineages.|$|E

The Americans send B52 bombers to attack the One Point Fives' base, but the aliens electronically disable the aircraft, causing them to crash short of their target. When the US President demands reparations, the One Point Fives provide gold distilled from seawater by way of compensation. With the Grand Galactics absent, the aliens make decisions for themselves: the One Point Fives provide Earth with new forms {{of power and the}} Machine Stored reveal mind uploading technology. When Myra dies in a scuba diving accident, her mind is uploaded into cyberspace, with Ranjit joining her later.|$|E
5|$|Agreeing to fund {{half of the}} {{proposed}} £1million budget, the Hong Kong Shaw Brothers became partners in the film's production. Elder brother Sir Run Run Shaw is credited as the presenter of Inseminoid in the opening titles. With a production staff of 75, principal photography commenced on 12 May 1980. John Metcalfe, camera operator for Satan's Slave and Terror, {{assumed the role of}} cinematographer. His former role fell to the less experienced Dick Pope. Three weeks of location filming at the Chislehurst Caves in Kent preceded a one-week indoor session at Lee International Studios at Wembley Park in London. The second unit completed special effects and linking shots in a fifth week, based at Film House in Wardour Street. To simulate <b>the</b> <b>desolate</b> landscape of the alien planet in long shots, the production team departed for the island of Gozo off Malta for a final shoot of two days, capitalising on the strong Mediterranean sun to produce good lighting.|$|E
25|$|The area in and {{surrounding}} Laurel Hill State Park no longer resembles <b>the</b> <b>desolate</b> wasteland {{left behind the}} lumbermen.

25|$|Every Thanksgiving the {{editorial}} page prints two famous articles that have appeared there since 1961. The first is titled <b>The</b> <b>Desolate</b> Wilderness, and describes what the Pilgrims saw {{when they arrived at}} the Plymouth Colony.

Royster, whose Christmas article In Hoc Anno Domini, has appeared every December 25 since 1949.|$|E
25|$|On July 15, 1942, {{a flight}} of six P-38s and two B-17 bombers, {{with a total of}} 25 crew members on board, took off from Presque Isle Air Base in Maine headed for the U.K. What {{followed}} was a harrowing and life-threatening landing of the entire squadron on a remote ice cap in Greenland. Miraculously, none of the crew was lost and they were all rescued and returned safely home after spending several days on <b>the</b> <b>desolate</b> ice.|$|E
60|$|In <b>the</b> {{meantime}} <b>the</b> <b>desolating</b> {{career of}} General Phillips {{was brought to}} a close.

He died four days afterwards; honored and deeply regretted by his brothers in arms, as a meritorious and well-tried soldier.|$|R
6000|$|The real {{horror of}} modern war, {{when all is}} said and done, is the boredom. To get killed our wounded may be unpleasant, but it is at any rate interesting; the real tragedy is in <b>the</b> <b>desolated</b> fields, <b>the</b> <b>desolated</b> houses, <b>the</b> <b>desolated</b> hours and days, <b>the</b> bored and <b>desolated</b> minds that hang behind the melee and just outside the melee. The {{peculiar}} beastliness of the German crime is the way the German war cant and its consequences have seized upon and paralysed the mental movement of Western Europe. Before 1914 war was theoretically unpopular in every European country; we thought of it as something tragic and dreadful. Now everyone knows by experience that it is something utterly dirty and detestable. We thought it was the Nemean lion, and we have found it is the Augean stable. But being bored by war and hating war is quite unproductive unless you are thinking about its nature and causes so thoroughly that you will presently be able to take hold of it and control it and end it. It is no good for everyone to say unanimously, [...] "We will have no more war," [...] unless you have thought out how to avoid it, and mean to bring that end about. It is as if everyone said, [...] "We will have no more catarrh," [...] or [...] "no more flies," [...] or [...] "no more east wind." [...] And my point is that the immense sorrows at home in every European country and the vast boredom of the combatants are probably not really producing any effective remedial mental action at all, and will not do so unless we get much more thoroughly to work upon the thinking-out process.|$|R
50|$|The {{existence}} of the little colony was short, for the Indians came down upon it in revenge for an arbitrary act {{on the part of}} Hosset, and it was destroyed, not a soul escaping to tell the tale. According to acknowledged precedent, occupancy of the wilderness served to perfect title; but before the Dutch could reoccupy <b>the</b> <b>desolated</b> site at Lewes, the English were practically in possession.|$|R
25|$|Del Parque {{established}} his winter headquarters at San Martín de Trevejo in the Sierra de Gata and began reassembling his troops. He had led 32,000 men at Alba de Tormes, but {{a month later}} could only gather 26,000 soldiers. This suggests that 3,000 men deserted the colors after the battle. Worse was to follow. In <b>the</b> <b>desolate</b> district where the army was quartered, the starving troops were sometimes forced to subsist on acorns. By mid-January, 9,000 died or were rendered unfit by hunger and illness.|$|E
25|$|In {{an entry}} of the Shoku Nihongi, dated April 14, 741, {{it was noted}} that gifts of land, servants, horses and Buddhist sutras were made to the Hachiman shrine and for the {{construction}} of a pagoda. Bender considers these offerings to be in thanks for the suppression of Hirotsugu's rebellion. While not directly related to the rebellion, Shōmu's edict of 741, in which he decreed that provincial temples be established, is another indication for <b>the</b> <b>desolate</b> state of the country following a number of calamities.|$|E

Glass particles found within this basement were of a similar consistency to those found upon the soles of Basom's shoes. Upon conducting a search of the basement of this farmhouse, investigators discovered a further garment of her clothing, a length of electrical flex of the same type used to strangle the victim, and fresh human bloodstains, indicating this location as being the site of Basom's murder.|$|E

5000|$|Since 1992, the Shanghai Municipal Government {{has been}} {{pursuing}} a redevelopment of the area.

Then Victor hurried his mother {{out into the}} street, eager to escape <b>the</b> <b>desolating</b> air of this moral charnel-house.

25|$|The series {{revolves}} around Marshall Teller, a teenager whose family moves to <b>the</b> <b>desolate</b> town of Eerie, Indiana, population of 16,661. While moving into his new home, he meets Simon Holmes, {{one of the}} few normal people in Eerie. Together, they are faced with bizarre scenarios, which include discovering a sinister group of intelligent dogs that are planning on taking over the world, and meeting a tornado hunter who is reminiscent of Captain Ahab. They also confront numerous urban legends such as Bigfoot and a still-living Elvis Presley. Although the show was host to a plethora of jokes, it also featured a serious tone.|$|E
25|$|Unable to {{maintain}} his army on <b>the</b> <b>desolate</b> plain, Sinan Pasha was forced to winter in Van. Armies sent {{in pursuit of the}} Shah in 1605 were defeated, and by 1606 Abbas had regained all of the territory lost to the Turks earlier in his reign. The scorched-earth tactic had worked, though at a terrible cost to the Armenian people. Of the 300,000 deported it is calculated that less than half survived the march to Isfahan. In the conquered territories Abbas established the Erivan Khanate, a Muslim principality under the dominion of the Safavid Empire. Armenians formed less than 20% of its population as a result of Shah Abbas I's deportation of many of the Armenian population from the Ararat valley and the surrounding region in 1605.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, {{while he}} was still leading Chinese forces in Shanxi, Japanese {{soldiers}} who had joined the Communists and were serving under Lin's command presented Lin with a Japanese uniform and katana, which they had captured in battle. Lin then put the uniform and katana on, jumped onto a horse, and rode away from the army. While riding, Lin was spotted alone by a sharpshooter in Yan's army. The soldier was surprised to see a Japanese officer riding a horse in <b>the</b> <b>desolate</b> hills alone. He took aim at Lin and severely injured him. The bullet grazed Lin's head, penetrating deep enough to leave a permanent impression on his skull. After being shot in the head, Lin fell from his horse and injured his back.|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} being fair, we continu'd our march, and arriv'd at <b>the</b> <b>desolated</b> Gnadenhut. There was a saw-mill near, round which were left several piles of boards, {{with which we}} soon hutted ourselves; an {{operation}} the more necessary at that inclement season, as we had no tents. Our first work was to bury more effectually the dead we found there, who had been half interr'd by the country people.|$|R

50|$|Several Colombian {{critics have}} remarked Álvarez’s use of {{language}} in Falsas alarmas as an evidence of a “young writer who knows his craft, and has talent and appreciation for the written word” (Guido Tamayo) and of a style “without pretensions” (Francisco Barrios).
