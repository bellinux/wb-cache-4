5|$|Covered {{interest}} rate parity is a no-arbitrage condition in foreign exchange markets which {{depends on the}} availability of the forward market. It can be rearranged to give the forward exchange rate {{as a function of the}} other variables. The forward exchange rate depends on three known variables: the spot exchange rate, the domestic {{interest rate}}, and the foreign interest rate. This effectively means that the forward rate is the price of a forward contract, which derives its value from <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> of spot contracts and the addition of information on available interest rates.|$|E

50|$|The {{way that}} the tax burden is divided upon the {{consumer}} and seller depends on <b>the</b> <b>price</b> elasticity for sugary drinks. The tax burden will fall more on sellers when <b>the</b> <b>price</b> elasticity of demand is greater than <b>the</b> <b>price</b> elasticity of supply while on buyers when <b>the</b> <b>price</b> elasticity of supply is greater than <b>the</b> <b>price</b> elasticity of demand. <b>The</b> <b>price</b> elasticity for sugary drinks is different from country to country. For instance, <b>the</b> <b>price</b> elasticity of demand for sugary drinks {{was found to be}} -1.37 in Chile while -1.16 in Mexico. Hence if both of those results would be realistic and <b>the</b> <b>price</b> elasticity of supply would be the same for both, the tax burden on consumers would be higher in Mexico then in Chile.|$|R

A corrective pricing mechanism, such as a carbon tax, could lead to renewable energy, such as solar thermal power, becoming cheaper to the consumer than fossil fuel based energy.|$|E

5|$|Though these {{measures}} were established to counter {{many of the}} irrationalities in the Soviet economic system, the reform {{did not try to}} change the existing system radically; it instead tried to improve it gradually. Success was ultimately mixed, and Soviet analyses on why the reform failed to reach its full potential have never given any definitive answers. The key factors are agreed upon, however, with blame being put on the combination of the recentralisation of the economy with the decentralisation of enterprise autonomy, creating several administrative obstacles. Additionally, instead of creating a market which in turn would establish a pricing system, administrators were given the responsibility for overhauling <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> system themselves. Because of this, the market-like system failed to materialise. To make matters worse, the reform was contradictory at best. In retrospect, however, the Eighth Five-Year Plan as a whole is considered {{to be one of the}} most successful periods for the Soviet economy, and the most successful for consumer production.|$|E
5|$|Owing {{to budget}} {{constraints}} and the scheduled closure of Boeing's Globemaster production line in 2015, {{it was considered}} unlikely in 2012 that the RAAF would acquire more Globemasters. However, in August 2014 Minister for Defence David Johnston stated that the Government was likely to purchase a further one or two C-17s. The Government {{announced that it would}} purchase two Globemasters in October 2014, and requested information on <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> and availability for a further pair of aircraft. In November 2014 Australia lodged a formal request with the United States Defense Security Cooperation Agency for four C-17s and associated equipment, for a total cost of $A1.85 billion. An order for the RAAF's seventh and eighth Globemasters was formally announced by Prime Minister Tony Abbott on 10April 2015. The first of the new C-17s arrived in Australia on 29 July 2015, and the second on 4 November that year. These two aircraft were among the last C-17s to have been built before the production line was closed, and it is not expected that the RAAF will acquire more Globemasters. It was reported in December 2014 that the New Zealand Government was considering purchasing between two and four Globemasters, and Australian Aviation journalist Andrew McLaughlin suggested that any such acquisition would build on Australia's C-17 support infrastructure. The New Zealand Government ultimately decided to not purchase any Globemasters.|$|E
5|$|The first {{indication}} of the franchises' displeasure with their parent over this issue came in 2005 and involved claims by a Manhattan-based franchise that the company failed {{to take into account}} local market conditions when setting prices. E-Z Eating Corp., operator of five restaurants in New York and owned by brother-sister partners Elizabeth and Luan Sadik, had been struggling after the 9/11 terrorist attacks but had been in a company-sponsored turn around program when Burger King started its new value program in 2006. The program required all locations to carry a specific set of products at a discounted price, with limited exemptions for certain locations that met a set of criteria. The Sadiks applied for an exemption to <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> requirement but were turned down by Burger King. In response to the denial, the Sadiks closed two of their locations without consulting Burger King and refused to implement the scheme in their other two locations. Burger King responded by suing the company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida for breach of contract, and eventually revoked the franchise agreement for the remaining two locations in January 2006. The Sadik's responded by filing their own lawsuit in 2008 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York claiming that Burger King had engaged in a breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair in its actions towards the franchise. The actions were eventually consolidated in a single case in the Southern District Court under Judge Maricia G. Cooke, where Burger King requested and was granted a summary judgement against the Sadiks. The judgment was upheld on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in June 2009.|$|E

40|$|The time {{evolution}} of <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of resources {{sold to the}} market and of <b>the</b> <b>price</b> difference, between sold and extracted resources, is investigated in case of no accumulation of the resources; i. e. when the resources are extracted and sold to the market at the same mass flow rate. <b>The</b> <b>price</b> {{evolution of}} sold resources varies with time according to the relation between <b>the</b> <b>price</b> increase factor, PIF, of sold and extracted resources. <b>The</b> <b>price</b> evolutions of sold resources and price difference are investigated according to the relation between extraction rate and interest rate of extracted and sold resources. <b>The</b> <b>price</b> of sold resources and <b>the</b> <b>price</b> difference increase with time if the PIF of sold resources {{is greater than the}} PIF of extracted resources and <b>the</b> initial <b>price</b> is greater than <b>the</b> critical <b>price</b> of sold resources, which depends on <b>the</b> initial <b>price</b> of extracted resources and the interest rate of non-extracted and extracted resources. <b>The</b> <b>price</b> of sold resources and <b>the</b> <b>price</b> difference decrease with time if the PIF of sold resources is greater than the PIF of extracted resources and <b>the</b> initial <b>price</b> is smaller than <b>the</b> critical <b>price</b> of sold resources.
