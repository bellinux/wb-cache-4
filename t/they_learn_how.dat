50|$|Because of the {{disaster}} of the previous battle (Caudine Forks) and the Battle of Lautulae, the Roman military began to reorganize and rethink their strategy. The Romans {{had a knack for}} learning from their enemies, such as the Greeks, Etruscans, and Carthaginians. For example, <b>they</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> to fight with round shields from the Etruscans, and <b>they</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> to manipulate siege craft from the Greeks. What <b>they</b> <b>learned</b> from the Samnites was how to fight in maniples armed with pilums (javelins) and scutums (shields), and they later turned this against the Samnites and defeated them.|$|R
5|$|Cadets today {{live and}} work within the {{framework}} of the Cadet Leader Development System (CLDS), which specifies the roles that a cadet plays throughout their four years at the academy. Cadets begin their USMA careers as trainees (new cadets), then advance in rank, starting as CDT Privates (freshmen) and culminating as CDT Officers (seniors). Freshmen have no leadership responsibilities, but have a host of duties to perform as <b>they</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> to follow orders and operate in an environment of rigid rank structure, while seniors have significant leadership responsibilities and significantly more privileges that correspond to their rank.|$|E
25|$|Chiapas’ most {{important}} handcraft is textiles, {{most of which}} is cloth woven on a backstrap loom. Indigenous girls often learn how to sew and embroider before <b>they</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> to speak Spanish. They are also taught how to make natural dyes from insects, and weaving techniques. Many of the items produced are still for day-to-day use, often dyed in bright colors with intricate embroidery. They include skirts, belts, rebozos, blouses, huipils and shoulder wraps called chals. Designs are in red, yellow, turquoise blue, purple, pink, green and various pastels and decorated with designs such as flowers, butterflies, and birds, all based on local flora and fauna. Commercially, indigenous textiles are most often found in San Cristóbal de las Casas, San Juan Chamula and Zinacantán. The best textiles {{are considered to be}} from Magdalenas, Larráinzar, Venustiano Carranza and Sibaca.|$|E
25|$|Infants {{begin the}} process of {{language}} acquisition by being able to detect very small differences between speech sounds. They can discriminate all possible speech contrasts (phonemes). Gradually, as they are exposed to their native language, their perception becomes language-specific, i.e. <b>they</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> to ignore the differences within phonemic categories of the language (differences that may well be contrastive in other languages – for example, English distinguishes two voicing categories of plosives, whereas Thai has three categories; infants must learn which differences are distinctive in their native language uses, and which are not). As infants learn how to sort incoming speech sounds into categories, ignoring irrelevant differences and reinforcing the contrastive ones, their perception becomes categorical. Infants learn to contrast different vowel phonemes of their native language by approximately 6 months of age. The native consonantal contrasts are acquired by 11 or 12 months of age. Some researchers have proposed that infants may be able to learn the sound categories of their native language through passive listening, using a process called statistical learning. Others even claim that certain sound categories are innate, that is, they are genetically specified (see discussion about innate vs. acquired categorical distinctiveness).|$|E

40|$|For some time, Teacher Education {{policy and}} {{research}} has consistently argued that graduates are ill {{prepared to use}} ICT in their practice (TEMAG, 2015). In Australia, an increasing regulatory environment means that Teacher Education providers need to meet national accreditation demands as well as design programs that address professional standards for graduates where an effective ICT use is a requirement. In an effort to have greater {{understanding of how to}} design Teacher Education programs that meet these challenges, this small scale study investigated where 69 pre-service teachers <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> to use a number of ICT resources commonly used in primary and secondary schools. Findings suggest that <b>they</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> to use many resources (particularly general-type resources) in their everyday life prior to undertaking their teaching qualification and that <b>they</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> to use a lesser number in university coursework or practicum in schools. A number of implications for Teacher Education conclude this paper...|$|R

Students traveled from China via the Siberian railway, a trip which took about eighteen days and cost approximately two hundred dollars.
