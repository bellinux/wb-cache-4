25|$|The outer part of {{the double}} coat should be {{straight}} and wiry in texture, never soft, silky, curly, wavy, or woolly {{as might be expected}} in the Kerry Blue Terrier. The coat should lie flat against the skin, and, though having some length, should never be so long as to hide the true shape of the dog. There are longer hairs on the legs, but never so much as a Wire Fox Terrier or Schnauzer. <b>That</b> <b>means</b> <b>you</b> have to have the coat trimmed often which can be expensive.|$|E

[...] But they did not? [...] "No, {{not all of them}} did. In fact, some were invented from almost the beginning to almost the end." [...] The Rebbe leaned forward as if to measure me up and said with more sorrow than anger: <b>That</b> <b>means</b> <b>you</b> are writing lies! I did not answer immediately. The scolded child within me had nothing to say in his defense. Yet, I had to justify myself: [...] "Things are not that simple, Rebbe. Some events do take place but are not true; others are—although they never occurred." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 20, 2014, the U.S. House Veterans Affairs Committee {{learned that}} every one of the 470 senior {{executives}} in the VA received performance evaluations that indicated they were at least [...] "fully successful" [...] {{in each of the past}} four years. Congressional representatives argued that the data shows that senior management in the VA is out of touch with the problems in the department. Republican Representative Phil Roe said, [...] "Do you think that’s normal in business, that nearly every executive is successful? <b>That</b> <b>means</b> <b>you</b> put the bar down here, so anybody can step over it." [...] Democratic Representative Ann McLane Kuster compared the situation to grade inflation. Senior executives were paid a total of $2.4 million in bonus compensation in the most recent year. Gina S. Farrisee, VA assistant secretary for human resources and administration, admitted in her written comments that the department needed to do better at holding executives accountable.|$|E

Once you put it in there, the salt oozes around it. These are geologically stable for a 50 to 100 million year time scale. The trouble with those type of places for repositories is you don't have access to it anymore. But say for certain types of waste you don't want to have access to it anymore—that's good. It's a very natural containment. ...whereas there would be other waste where you say it has some inherent value, let's keep it around for a hundred years, two hundred years, because there's a high likelihood we'll come back to it and want to recover that.|$|E
500|$|With the {{intention}} of playing the 2015 season in the forward line alongside Jesse Hogan and Chris Dawes, a groin injury hampered Watts' pre-season training for three months heading into the season. He had a strong start to the season recording seventeen disposals, seven marks and three goals in the club's twenty-six point win against Gold Coast at the MCG in round one and was named in Melbourne's best players by AFL Media. After a buoyant start to the season, he quickly found himself facing negativity from the media after the round three loss to Adelaide at the Adelaide Oval where he dropped two marks in quick succession, with one leading to an Adelaide goal. Multiple media figures called {{for him to be}} dropped with David Schwarz stating he [...] "might have to sit out a week" [...] and Dermott Brereton professing [...] "you have to make a stand as to what your team stands for, and <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>you</b> can't bring him back in until you are convinced he will not do that again"; Jason Dunstall supplemented these statements by noting [...] "he can't relapse into these kind of performances", adding [...] "I don't like using the word, but he looked a little soft at times".|$|E
500|$|The {{opening track}} [...] "Doo Rags" [...] contemplates Nas' youth and society's {{cyclical}} nature. It features a contemporary piano loop and jazz tones. Richard Hazell from HipHopDX describes the song as [...] "a piano propelled painting {{of time and}} space as seen through the third eye of Nas, which can easily be envisioned by any New York City dweller." [...] On [...] "My Way", he meditates over his rise out of poverty to the [...] "life of a rich thug", recalls the death of his childhood friend Ill Will, and concedes that he [...] "still feels broke with millions in the bank." [...] On [...] "U Gotta Love It", Nas makes reference to the [...] "'86 crack blitz" [...] and discusses his own significance: [...] "This thug life you claimed it, I make millions from entertainment / Now back in the , certain cats they wanna kill me / They ice-grill me, but on the low, niggas feel me." [...] "Nothing Lasts Forever" [...] advises to appreciate life's small epiphanies and be optimistic about the future. On [...] "No Idea's Original", Nas notes the similarities of people in life and views other rappers as creatively derivative, while distinguishing himself from them: [...] "No idea's original, there's nothin new under the sun / It's never what you do, but how it's done / What you base your happiness around material, women, and large paper / <b>That</b> <b>means</b> <b>you</b> inferior, not major." [...] He references the line [...] "there's nothing new under the sun" [...] from the Book of Ecclesiastes in the song's chorus. [...] "No Idea's Original" [...] samples Barry White's 1973 song [...] "I'm Gonna Love You Just a Little More Baby", a frequently sampled recording in hip hop music.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2006 {{interview}} with the Washington Post, Steel commented on gun control: [...] "Society should draw lines. What do you need an assault weapon for, if you're going hunting? That's overkill. But I don't think <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>you</b> go to a total ban {{for those who want}} to use gun for skeet shooting or hunting or things like that. But what's the point of passing gun laws if we're not going to enforce them? If you want to talk about gun control, that's where you need to start. We've got 300 gun laws on the books right now. At the end of the day, it's about how we enforce the law." ...|$|E
2500|$|To the {{statement}} that the Kansas science standards {{had nothing to do}} with intelligent design but were only about teaching evolution in a [...] "balanced" [...] way, Borofsky responded: [...] "It really is ID in disguise. The entire purpose behind all of this is to shift it into schools...at least that is the hope/fear among some science teachers in the area. The problem is, if you are not going to be dogmatic in Darwinism <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>you</b> inevitably have to point out a fault or at least an alternative to Darwinism. So far, the only plausible theory is ID. If one is to challenge Darwin, then one must use ID. To challenge Darwin is to challenge natural selection/spontaneous first cause...which is what the Kansas board is attempting to do. When you do that, you have to invoke the idea of ID." ...|$|E

2500|$|Patrik Lindén, {{spokesman}} for EURid at the time, denied the allegations by Parsons, stating that [...] " [...] verified that each registrar was an individual legal entity. Each {{had to sign}} an agreement with us, and prepay €10,000." [...] Parsons didn't dispute that each registrar was a separate legal entity, but noted that creating such entities was trivial: [...] "Mr. Linden seemed proud that the EURid registry verified that each applicant was a legal entity before it was accredited. Take a moment {{and think about what}} <b>that</b> <b>means.</b> <b>You</b> can form a “legal entity” for $50 – an LLC – and you are good to go. Is that what we want a registry to do?
