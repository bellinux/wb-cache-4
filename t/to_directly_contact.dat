40|$|Due to the {{chemical}} inertness of 2 D hexagonal-Boron Nitride (h-BN), few atomic-layer h-BN {{is often used}} to encapsulate air-sensitive 2 D crystals such as Black Phosphorus (BP). However, the effects of h-BN on Schottky barrier height, doping and contact resistance are not well known. Here, we investigate these effects by fabricating h-BN encapsulated BP transistors with cobalt (Co) contacts. In sharp contrast <b>to</b> <b>directly</b> Co <b>contacted</b> p-type BP devices, we observe strong n-type conduction upon insertion of the h-BN at the Co/BP interface. First principles calculations show that this difference arises from the much larger interface dipole at the Co/h-BN interface compared to the Co/BP interface, which reduces the work function of the Co/h-BN contact. The Co/h-BN contacts exhibit low contact resistances (~ 4. 5 k-ohm), and are Schottky barrier free. This allows us to probe high electron mobilities (4, 200 cm 2 /Vs) and observe insulator-metal transitions even under two-terminal measurement geometry...|$|R

In addition <b>to</b> passing <b>directly</b> over <b>contact</b> sites, the ends of single microtubules could be observed to target several contacts in succession or the same contact repetitively, with intermittent withdrawals. Targeting sometimes involved side-stepping, or the major re-routing of a microtubule, indicative of a guided, rather than a random process. The paths that microtubules followed into contacts were unrelated to the orientation of stress fiber assemblies and targeting occurred also in mouse fibroblast...|$|R
40|$|Determining {{the three}} {{dimensional}} arrangement of proteins {{in a complex}} is highly beneficial for uncovering mechanistic function and interpreting genetic variation in coding genes comprising protein complexes. There are several methods for determining co-complex interactions between proteins, among them co-fractionation / mass spectrometry (CF-MS), but it remains difficult <b>to</b> identify <b>directly</b> <b>contacting</b> subunits within a multi-protein complex. Correlation analysis of CF-MS profiles shows promise in detecting protein complexes as a whole but is limited {{in its ability to}} infer direct physical contacts among proteins in sub-complexes. To identify direct protein-protein contacts within human protein complexes we learn a sparse conditional dependency graph from approximately 3, 000 CF-MS experiments on human cell lines. We show substantial performance gains in estimating direct interactions compared to correlation analysis on a benchmark of large protein complexes with solved three-dimensional structures. We demonstrate the method's value in determining the three dimensional arrangement of proteins by making predictions for complexes without known structure (the exocyst and tRNA multi-synthetase complex) and by establishing evidence for the structural position of a recently discovered component of the core human EKC/KEOPS complex, GON 7 /C 14 ORF 142, providing a more complete 3 D model of the complex. Direct contact prediction provides easily calculable additional structural information for large-scale protein complex mapping studies and should be broadly applicable across organisms as more CF-MS datasets become available...|$|R
40|$|Device {{performances}} were investigated for InGaN/sapphire light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with advanced heat dissipation design from chip <b>to</b> package. By <b>directly</b> <b>contacting</b> a copper heat spreader with sapphire, the maximum junction {{temperature of the}} LED chip was reduced from 62. 9 degrees C of a conventional LED to 48. 3 degrees C at an injection current of 350 mA. Further temperature reduction to 37. 3 degrees C could be achieved by packaging the copper-surrounded LED chip on the heat sink coated with a diamond-like layer which acts as the second heat spreader. The reduced junction temperature was attributed to good heat dissipation from both the copper and the diamond-like layer due to their low thermal resistance. The copper heat spreader not only extracts heat efficiently, but also enhances the light extraction of the LED, as the copper was designed with a proper geometry such as cup-shaped profile. The improved LED performance suggests that the proposed thermal management from chip to package is an efficient alternative for high power applications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Recruitment {{to primary}} care trials, {{particularly}} those involving young children, {{is known to}} be difficult. There are limited data available to inform researchers about the effectiveness of different trial recruitment strategies and their associated costs. PURPOSE: To describe, evaluate, and investigate the costs of three strategies for recruiting febrile children to a community-based randomised trial of antipyretics. METHODS: The three recruitment strategies used in the trial were termed as follows: (1) 'local', where paediatric research nurses stationed in primary care sites invited parents of children to participate; (2) 'remote', where clinicians at primary care sites faxed details of potentially eligible children to the trial office; and (3) 'community', where parents, responding <b>to</b> trial publicity, <b>directly</b> <b>contacted</b> the trial office when their child was unwell. RESULTS: Recruitment rates increased in response to the sequential introduction of three recruitment strategies, which were supplemented by additional recruiting staff, flexible staff work patterns, and improved clinician reimbursement schemes. The three strategies yielded different randomisation rates. They also appeared to be interdependent and highly effective together. Strategy-specific costs varied from £ 297 to £ 857 per randomised participant and represented approximately 10...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe second helix in the C-terminal {{domain of}} {{retroviral}} capsid (CA) protein functions {{as the site}} of dimerization between subunits in capsid assembly and is believed to participate in a unique interface between Gag molecules in immature particles. This study reports isolation of two substitutions in the dimerization helix of Rous sarcoma virus CA protein that have the ability to suppress lethal defects in core maturation imposed by alterations to the major homology region (MHR) motif just upstream. Together with two previously published suppressors, these define an extended region of the dimerization helix that is unlikely <b>to</b> contribute <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> CA–CA <b>contacts</b> but whose assembly-competence may be strongly affected by conformation. The broad-spectrum suppression and temperature-sensitivity exhibited by some mutants argues that they act through modulation of protein conformation.
