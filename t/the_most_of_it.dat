5|$|The chaos {{continued}} as other royal guards were found and beaten; {{at least one}} more was killed and his head too appeared atop a pike. Finally, the fury of the attack subsided enough to permit some communication between the former French Guards, who formed the professional core of Lafayette's National Guard militia, and the royal gardes du corps. The units had a history of cooperation and a military sense of mutual respect, and Lafayette, who had been snatching a few hours of sleep in his exhaustion, awoke to make <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> To the relief of the royals, the two sets of soldiers were reconciled by his charismatic mediation and a tenuous peace was established within the palace.|$|E
25|$|When {{day three}} began, England may have harboured hopes {{of picking up}} the last four Australian wickets quickly, and setting about {{building}} a solid lead, however Steve Waugh wanted to press on. He was seeing the ball well, and moving {{into some of the}} best form of his career so far, and made <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Well supported by Hughes, who made a solid 30, Waugh began to free his arms, and lifted the Australian's run-rate.|$|E

25|$|Cremer then played Tests against South Africa and New Zealand. Unfortunately Cremer, {{seen by many}} as a Test specialist, had his {{opportunities}} limited thereafter due to Zimbabwe's self-imposed exile from Test cricket. After {{several years}} on the fringes of the national team Cremer finally broke into the limited overs squad against the West Indies in late 2007. However, Zimbabwe's strong spin attack of Ray Price and Prosper Utseya meant he did not get any game time. It wasn't until the Al Barakah Cup Twenty20 tournament in Canada that Cremer was finally given a chance in the shorter format, and he made <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> by taking 2/10 from his 3 overs.|$|E
25|$|Glamorgan won the toss at a cold Edgbaston {{and chose}} to bat. The pitch hade been roughed up to {{encourage}} {{turn for the}} benefit of Ashley Giles. The England selectors will have been pleased that he made <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> taking 6 for 44, the third-best figures of his career. First, however, Matthew Elliott, Glamorgan's Australian batsman scored 84 to take his team to a comfortable looking 157 for 3. However, Glamorgan then lost their final seven wickets for just 41 runs. Warwickshire's catching was excellent, as they restricted their opposition to 198 off 63.3 overs, two short of their first bonus point. Nick Knight and Mark Wagh then saw Warwickshire through to 68 for no loss, before bad light stopped play.|$|E
25|$|By 1747, single wicket had {{superseded}} the 11-a-side version as {{the most}} popular form of cricket and the 1748 season was the halcyon days of single wicket. Richmond made <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and his Slindon fives and threes were a regular feature of the great matches at the Artillery Ground. However, Newland did not always captain his team in 1747. There was a threes match in September {{in which he was}} again opposed by his rival Colchin, but the captaincy of his side had been given to Stephen Dingate, who was a regular fixture in Richmond's teams at this time. This could be evidence that Newland was past his best. In July 1747, he seems to be reconciled with Colchin because for the first time they played on the same side but, significantly, it was Long Robin's XI that Newland was playing for. In 1749, Newland was a member of an All-England team captained by Colchin.|$|E

25|$|It {{must have}} seemed like déjà {{vu all over again}} for England as they started day two, with Australia again poised for a large total. Border and Jones resumed and added a further 20 before Border was caught behind of Capel for 76. Jones was finally removed for 122, and Steve Waugh, who seemed to have gone off the boil {{slightly}} following his blistering first three tests, went for a disappointing 14, clean bowled by Igglesden. Rain interrupted temporarily, but play soon resumed, and the South London crowd was then treated with a blistering display of low-order hitting from Queensland-born keeper Ian Healy, who battered 44 off 44 balls. His innings lasted less than an hour and contained six 4s, also taking the Australian total past 400 for the sixth time in as many tests. Eventually he fell, caught behind of the bowling of Derek Pringle, who then proceeded to tear into the tail, collecting the last four wickets. Although Trevor Hohns (30) and Merv Hughes (21) lasted long enough to take the Australian total to 468, the tourists were all out shortly before stumps. Enough play was left to force England to face an awkward few overs, and the Australians made <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> dislodging Graham Gooch LBW to Alderman for a third ball duck. England finished the day on 1 for 1, both not out batsmen yet to score.|$|E
25|$|Brazil vs Uruguay 1970 – strike package: Jairzinho – Pelé – Tostão. The example below, {{is drawn}} {{from one of the}} most famous strike teams in World Cup history- Pelé, Tostão and Jairzinho. This goal, against Uruguay in the 1970 semi-final, captures the power of the move. The fast winger Jairzinho set the stage- {{dribbling}} down the right flank before finding Pelé ahead. Tightly marked, and with his back to the goal, Pelé immediately played a subtle pass to Tostão. The Brazilian center-forward drew the defence to him with a short dribble before finding Jairzinho again on the wing. This exchange of passes gave Jairzinho a lead on other defenders and he made <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> – accelerating down the wing, selling a dummy (letting the ball run after pretending to stop and play it) on Uruguayan defender Matosas, and muscling him aside as he approached the enemy goal. Uruguayan keeper Mazurkiewicz came off his line but it was simply too late, as Jairzinho slotted the ball into the net. Of note in this sequence is the attacking space created by the tight exchanges between Jairzinho, Pelé, and Tostão. Even the Uruguayans, playing one of the most densely packed, solid defences seen in a World Cup could not stop it. Jairzinho is surrounded by opposing defenders when the sequence starts, but at the end, he only has one to deal with. Also of note is the unselfish passing of Brazilian striker Tostão, with his skill creating countless openings for his teammates throughout the 1970 tournament.|$|E

500|$|Growth of {{the city}} and trade came with the rise of England's American colonies in the 17th century. [...] Bristol's {{location}} {{on the west side of}} Great Britain gave its ships an advantage in sailing to and from the New World, and the city's merchants made <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> [...] The 18th century saw an expansion of England's role in the Atlantic trade in Africans taken for slavery to the Americas. Bristol and Liverpool became centres of the Triangular Trade. In the first side of the slavery triangle, manufactured goods were shipped to West Africa and exchanged for Africans; the enslaved captives were transported across the Atlantic to the Americas in the Middle Passage under brutal conditions. In the third side of the triangle, plantation goods such as sugar, tobacco, rum, rice, cotton and a few slaves (sold to the aristocracy as house servants) returned across the Atlantic. Some household slaves were baptised in the hope this would mean their freedom in England. The Somersett Case of 1772 clarified that slavery was illegal in England. At the height of the Bristol slave trade from 1700 to 1807, more than 2,000 slave ships carried a conservatively estimated 500,000 people from Africa to slavery in the Americas. The Seven Stars public house, where abolitionist Thomas Clarkson collected information on the slave trade, is still operating.|$|E

2500|$|This phrase {{stuck in}} the minds of the other sportswriters in {{attendance}} and, McGregor suggested, it spread among all the league's writers, becoming a catch phrase. [...] "The old Oakland park's short fence caught <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> from Mike, and his 'Mandarin fan' waving balls out of the park were knocked back to 'Chinese homers'", said McGregor. A number of Murphy's comments were adapted into cartoons by Dorgan, a native of San Francisco, and from there the term migrated into print. McGregor believed that either Ed Hughes or Harry Smith of the San Francisco Chronicle were the first to do so, and better-known writers like Ring Lardner and Damon Runyon may have picked it up from them and popularized it nationwide.|$|E

This also served to distinguish them among the ticket-buying public from other, pre-existing types of music festivals such as jazz and folk festivals. By the end of 1972, the term ‘pop festival’ had virtually disappeared as festival promoters adopted more creative, unique and location-specific names to identify and advertise their events. While it was still in vogue, however, over-zealous promoters eager to capitalize on the festival concept made <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> with some using the term [...] "Pop Festival" [...] or [...] "Rock Festival" [...] to advertise events held on a single day or evening, often indoors, and featuring only a handful of acts.|$|E
