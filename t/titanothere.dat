Based on these remains, Foster-Cooper moved A. bugtiense to the new genus Paraceratherium, meaning [...] "near the hornless beast", in reference to Aceratherium. His rationale for this reclassification was the species' distinctly down-turned lower tusks. In 1913, Forster-Cooper named a new genus and species, Thaumastotherium ("wonderful beast") osborni, based on larger fossils from the same excavations, but he renamed the genus Baluchitherium later that year because the former name was preoccupied, as {{it had already been}} used for a hemipteran insect.

5000|$|In 1941, a {{committee}} chaired by Horace E. Wood II {{compiled a list}} of 19 [...] "provincial ages" [...] for North America, later called North American Land Mammal Ages (NMLAs). An example of an NMLA is the Rancholabrean, named after the Rancho La Brea fossil site. One of its characteristic fossils is the bison, which first appears in the Rancholabrean. The committee tried to make the definitions unambiguous by providing multiple criteria such as index fossils, first and last occurrences, and the relation to a particular formation. Some of these criteria {{have turned out to be}} inconsistent, leading to conflict.

These protrusions are often used to push and destroy objects: a single sideways thrust of the neck being sufficient to down a significantly sized tree. The <b>Titanothere</b> has exceedingly thick, gray skin. There is a small [...] "fan" [...] feather structure on the head that it flares up as a warning symbol seen in the film and in the video game. The creature, which resembles a cross between a rhinoceros and a hammerhead shark, is easily aroused. Its hide is impervious to human ammunition, though firing on it is known to anger it. This massive, grazing creature travels in moderately large herds or packs of 10-20 animals. Avatar creature designer Yuri Bartoli explained about the creature's colorful threat display: [...] "Originally, the Hammerhead just had to be a huge creature, big enough that even a Thanator would think twice about attacking one. A threat display is meant to be seen, so it required bright colors that would stand out against its more muted body". It is moderately social, but also extremely territorial and hierarchical. A soft ungulate mouth is protected by a rigid, beak-like jaw structure. The species is scientifically known as Titanotheris hammercephalis. In the climax of the film, a bunch of Hammerhead <b>Titanothere</b> assist the Naʼvi in their battle against Colonel Miles Quaritch's army.|$|E

After the start of the Cenozoic, early Paleocene turtles left behind fossils near modern Golden. [...] The Coloradan flora of the ensuing Eocene epoch left behind plant fossils like ferns, palm leaves, and petrified wood. Animal life of northwestern Colorado during the Eocene included the primitive horse Eohippus, early <b>titanotheres,</b> and uintatheres. A rich flora grew in Colorado during the Oligocene. At least 150 different kinds of plants from this epoch are preserved in what is now the Florissant beds of Colorado. Among the members of this flora were sequoia trees with trunks up to 17 and a half feet in diameter. More than a thousand different kinds of insect have been documented among the same beds. Beetles were among the Florissant insects. A diverse mammalian fauna inhabited this ancient forest. Members included animals resembling giant pigs, rhinoceroses, and <b>titanotheres.</b> During the Pliocene, Colorado was home to creatures like rhinoceroses and giant pig-like animals. The state's modern prairies formed during the Quaternary. Colorado was shaken by volcanic eruptions. The state's climate gradually cooled as the Cenozoic proceeded.

The find was a 45-foot long articulated vertebral column with some ribs and teeth associated that was located at the top of a high ridge. The men interpreted the remains as originating from a giant fish, but today scientists think the specimen was probably a mosasaur, or maybe a plesiosaur. The expedition sent back some of the fossils, but these were later lost. Later, in 1847, Dr. Hiram A. Prout published a description of a fragmentary <b>titanothere</b> jaw discovered in the White River Badlands in the American Journal of Science. Not long afterward, Joseph Leidy described the Oligocene camel Poebrotherium, which was discovered in the same general region as Prout's <b>titanothere</b> jaw. The government responded to these discoveries by dispatching an expedition into the area. In 1850 the Smithsonian sent its own collectors into the area. The Tertiary deposits of the White River Badlands was active for decades and still ongoing in 1920 when the South Dakota School of Mines published its Bulletin No. 13. This publication summarized the results of all the paleontological fieldwork done in the White River Badlands.

It has been suggested that these animals engaged in intra-specific head-butting behavior, presumably for territory or mates.

At this time mammoths, musk oxen, and dire wolves lived in the areas of the state not covered by glaciers. Local Native Americans have been devising mythical explanations for fossils or applying them for practical purposes thousands of years.

The first known indricothere fossils were {{collected}} from Balochistan (in modern-day Pakistan) in 1846 by a soldier named Vickary, but these fragments were unidentifiable at the time. The first fossils now recognised as Paraceratherium were discovered by the British geologist Guy Ellcock Pilgrim in Balochistan in 1907-1908. His material consisted of an upper jaw, lower teeth, {{and the back of}} a jaw. The fossils were collected in the Chitarwata Formation of Dera Bugti, where Pilgrim had previously been exploring. In 1908, he used the fossils as basis for a new species of the extinct rhinoceros genus Aceratherium; A. bugtiense. Aceratherium was by then a wastebasket taxon; it included several unrelated species of hornless rhinoceros, many of which have since been moved to other genera. Fossil incisors that Pilgrim had previously assigned to the unrelated genus Bugtitherium were later shown to belong to the new species.In 1910, more partial fossils were discovered in Dera Bugti during an expedition by the British palaeontologist Clive Forster-Cooper.

50|$|After the {{extinction}} of the dominant reptile groups, the Cenozoic ushered in the Age of Mammals. Sea levels continued to decline until the vast Western Interior Seaway {{was reduced to a}} small inland body in North Dakota. Mammals were beginning to diversify and dominate the land. The creodonts, forerunners of modern carnivores, arose to prominence during the Paleocene. During the Eocene the western states were home to small primitive camels and horses. Over time both groups got larger and lost several toes. Even by the late Eocene mammals had entered the oceans and the great primitive whale Basilosaurus swam in the coastal waters of the southeastern states like Alabama and Mississippi. Rhino-like <b>titanotheres</b> dominated the South Dakota badlands of the Oligocene. From this point on the climate in the United States cooled until the iconic Ice Age mammals of the Pleistocene like saber-toothed cats, woolly mammoths, mastodons and dire wolves spread across the continent in advance of glaciers.

Segments left by ophiuroids are also common in rocks deposited in these marine environments. Other contemporary life included corals, clams, and snails. These Tertiary fossils are known from the Gulf Coastal Plain. Sharks left behind their teeth to fossilize during the Tertiary. During the Oligocene camels were widespread in Texas. Mammals resembling giant pigs were preserved in the Miocene deposits of the Coastal Plain. Camels remained widespread in the state. Sharks left behind fossil teeth during the Miocene, but not during the later epochs of the Cenozoic. Camels maintained a continued presence as significant members of the fauna during the Pliocene. During the Pleistocene Texas was home to camels, horses, mammoths, and other animals. Their fossils are common. Horses in particular were widespread in Texas during the Pleistocene. Camels were also widespread but for the last time in Texas history. Fossils of this age from the Gulf Coast and western part of the state included the remains of creatures like bison, mammoths, and mastodons. Other Cenozoic mammals of Texas included glyptodonts, mammoths, mastodons, saber teeth, giant ground sloths, <b>titanotheres,</b> uintatheres, and dire wolves.|$|R
50|$|Paleontology in South Dakota {{refers to}} paleontological {{research}} occurring within or conducted by {{people from the}} U.S. state of South Dakota. South Dakota is {{an excellent source of}} fossils as finds have been widespread throughout the state. During the early Paleozoic era South Dakota was submerged by a shallow sea that would come to be home to creatures like brachiopods, cephalopods, corals, and ostracoderms. Local sea levels rose and fall during the Carboniferous and the sea left completely during the Permian. During the Triassic, the state became a coastal plain, but by the Jurassic it was under a sea where ammonites lived. Cretaceous South Dakota was also covered by a sea that was home to mosasaurs. The sea remained in place after the start of the Cenozoic before giving way to a terrestrial mammal fauna including the camel Poebrotherium, three-toed horses, rhinoceroses, saber teeth, and <b>titanotheres.</b> During the Ice Age glaciers entered the state, which was home to mammoths and mastodons. Local Native Americans interpreted fossils as the remains of the water monster Unktehi and used bits of Baculites shells in magic rituals to summon buffalo herds.

40|$|In {{previous}} papers [1], published {{mostly in}} these PROCEEDINGS, have appeared {{some of the}} paleontological results of explorations conducted in the Sespe deposits of Southern California. While the field efforts south of the Santa Clara Valley, Ventura County, were rewarded by rather startling results, no small amount of irritation was felt because of failure to find fossil vertebrate remains in the Sespe at the type locality north of the Santa Clara Valley. For, as is now known, the Sespe is not of same age throughout its stratigraphic thickness or at the several localities where fossil mammals {{have been found in}} it. It is, in fact, a series of beds that range in age from at least the upper Eocene to apparently the lower Miocene. Thus it seems especially important to determine by means of vertebrate evidence the age relationships of the type Sespe on Sespe Creek to that portion of the Sespe whose age is already established south of the Santa Clara Valley. With this problem in mind the rugged terrain north of the Ojai Valley, Ventura County, and in the immediate vicinity of Sespe Gorge was critically examined during the summer of 1937 by a field party of the California Institute of Technology. The outcome of this work was the discovery of <b>titanothere</b> remains in the lower portion of the Sespe, including a palate with teeth permitting a comparison with the titanotheres known from lower Tertiary horizons of southern California...|$|E
5000|$|During {{the early}} part of the Cenozoic, central and eastern South Dakota was still covered by the sea. The uplift {{responsible}} for the Black Hills continued to elevate their topography. As the Cenozoic continued the sea shrank away from the state. In its place, grasslands formed and were roamed by herds of grazing mammals. Later, during the Oligocene, at least part of South Dakota was covered in seawater. The White River Formation was being deposited in the White River badlands as the sea gradually receded. The Oligocene flora left behind few fossils, but among them were hackberry seeds and petrified wood. Although plant fossils are scarce, these deposits preserve one of the best Tertiary mammal faunas in the world. More than 175 different kinds of animals were preserved from this time. The local mammals included the three-toed horses, pig-like animals, the camel Poebrotherium, Protoceras, rhinoceroses, rodents, saber teeth, tapirs, and <b>titanotheres.</b> Contemporary birds also left behind bones and even an egg. These are significant because bird fossils are very rare. Many streams carried even more sediment into the region from the young Rocky Mountains and Black Hills. At the time South Dakota consisted of plains dotted with marshes and shallow lakes and split by wide streams. Some of the local Oligocene wildlife left behind footprints that would later fossilize. The Brule Formation preserves one of only seven Oligocene fossil tracksites in the western United States. [...] Volcanic activity sporadically showered the state with ash. During the Ice Age, glaciers scoured the state. As they melted, they deposited sediments that would preserve the fossil remains of creatures like bison, horses, mammoths, and mastodons.|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} Cenozoic era, the sea began {{to retreat from}} Montana for the last time. Extreme tectonic {{activity}} helped form local mountains and raised much of the state's elevation. Local levels of precipitation rose and fell. Montana was home to creatures like dogs and <b>titanotheres.</b> The Tertiary deposits from the southwestern {{part of the state}} are one of the best sources of plant and insect fossils in North America. More than two hundred species of plants, insects, and fishes are known from these deposits. The flora included water lilies and lotuses. During the Tertiary Montana was home to swamps that would later leave coal behind. The invertebrate fauna consisted of ants, bees, beetles, earwigs, caddisflies, crane flies, damselflies, lantern flies, mayflies, grasshoppers, leafhoppers, mosquitoes, snails, and wasps. Contemporary vertebrate fossils included feathers and, once in a while, a bird. Among the Oligocene flora of Montana were ailanthus, ash, beech, cattails, cedar, cinquefoil, dogwood, elm, ferns, milfoil fernbush, gooseberry, climbing grapes, grasses, greenbriers, horsetails, ironwood, katsura tree, liverwort, mountain mahogany, maple, false mermaid, mosses, oak, pennycress, pondweed, dawn redwood, roses, sedges, smoke tree, snowberry, spiraea, false strawberry, and vetches. Similar floras are known from the Florissant of Colorado and Oregon. Montana's Miocene plants and mollusks left behind remains at Bear Butte, northwest of Melville in Sweet Grass County's Fort Union Beds. The Miocene mammals preserved in the Fort Union beds included arctocyonids, insectivores, multituberculates, pantodonts, primates, taeniodonts. During the Miocene Montana was also home to camels and horses. Later into the Cenozoic Montana became colder and wetter. Glacial activity scoured the state. At this time mammoths, musk oxen, and dire wolves lived in the areas of the state not covered by glaciers.|$|R

However, in 1900 William Utterback began fieldwork {{in the area}} under John Bell Hatcher for the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. In the two ensuing years of field work Utterback found many skeletons of previously known dinosaurs, but also the new genus Haplocanthosaurus. This was the smallest known sauropod species of the Morrison Formation. Around 1920 major fossil finds occurred in Oligocene deposits Colorado shares with South Dakota. Dozens of articulated skeletons and skulls were uncovered. Among them were animals resembling giant pigs, rhinoceroses, and <b>titanotheres.</b> One notable rhinoceros discovery had occurred in Weld County. In 1925 small duckbilled dinosaurs were discovered in eastern Colorado. Later, in 1955, the American Museum of Natural History uncovered a stone block in south-central Colorado preserving several Eocene Eohippus skeletons.In 1960 Malcolm McKenna discovered two early Paleocene turtles {{on behalf of the}} American Museum of Natural History on South Table Mountain. The following year, curator of the University of Colorado Museum at Boulder discovered even more turtles of that age at the same place. In the summer of 1961 a major discovery happened south of Denver in Douglas County. The owner of a tract of land used for cattle grazing was dredging out the bottom of a watering hole for the cattle. A great abundance of bones were discovered under the thin layer of mud {{at the bottom of the}} watering hole. The owners alerted paleontologists at Denver about the find. The researchers at Denver passed on word of the find to the Smithsonian Institution of Washington D.C. In response, the National Science Foundation funded an expedition coordinated by the Smithsonian Institution to the wateringhole. The lowest bones in the deposit were left by Columbian mammoths. Higher in the deposit the excavators uncovered bison, camels, and horses. By the end of the summer, 13 gigantic cases containing a total of 341 fossil bones were shipped to the National Museum in Washington D.C. In the spring of 1963, road work in Limon County near the town of Limon uncovered a mammoth tooth and tusk.|$|R
5000|$|Paleontology in Texas {{refers to}} paleontological {{research}} occurring within or conducted by {{people from the}} U.S. state of Texas. Author Marian Murray has remarked that [...] "Texas is as big for fossils {{as it is for}} everything else." [...] Some of the most important fossil finds in United States history have come from Texas. Fossils can be found throughout most of the state. The fossil record of Texas spans almost the entire geologic column from Precambrian to Pleistocene. Shark teeth are probably the state's most common fossil. During the early Paleozoic era Texas was covered by a sea that would later be home to creatures like brachiopods, cephalopods, graptolites, and trilobites. Little is known about the state's Devonian and early Carboniferous life. However, evidence indicates that during the late Carboniferous the state was home to marine life, land plants and early reptiles. During the Permian, the seas largely shrank away, but nevertheless coral reefs formed in the state. The rest of Texas was a coastal plain inhabited by early relatives of mammals like Dimetrodon and Edaphosaurus. During the Triassic, a great river system formed in the state that was inhabited by crocodile-like phytosaurs. Little is known about Jurassic Texas, but there are fossil aquatic invertebrates of this age like ammonites in the state. During the Early Cretaceous local large sauropods and theropods left a great abundance of footprints. Later in the Cretaceous, the state was covered by the Western Interior Seaway and home to creatures like mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, and few icthyosaurs. Early Cenozoic Texas still contained areas covered in seawater where invertebrates and sharks lived. On land the state would come to be home to creatures like glyptodonts, mammoths, mastodons, saber-toothed cats, giant ground sloths, <b>titanotheres,</b> uintatheres, and dire wolves. Archaeological evidence suggests that local Native Americans knew about local fossils. Formally trained scientists were already investigating the state's fossils by the late 1800s. In 1938, a major dinosaur footprint find occurred near Glen Rose. Pleurocoelus was the Texas state dinosaur from 1997 to 2009, when it was replaced by Paluxysaurus jonesi after the Texan fossils once referred to the former species were reclassified to a new genus.|$|R
