5|$|With {{river traffic}} increasing, damage from barge {{collisions}} increased. By 1972, the Greenville Bridge was hit more times by barges {{than any other}} bridge on the Mississippi. The bridge was located close to a sharp bend in the Mississippi; towboats and barges had difficulty making the sharp turn and regaining <b>their</b> <b>course</b> in time to avoid a collision with the bridge. Over the years many {{have not been able}} to make the turn quickly and have hit it. The bridge had become a danger to river traffic.|$|E
5|$|A thunderstorm, {{also known}} as an {{electrical}} storm, lightning storm, or thundershower, is a storm characterized {{by the presence of}} lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth's atmosphere, known as thunder. Thunderstorms occur in association with a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus. They are usually accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain, and sometimes snow, sleet, hail, or, in contrast, no precipitation at all. Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband, known as a squall line. Strong or severe thunderstorms, known as supercells, rotate as do cyclones. While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy, vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in <b>their</b> <b>course</b> at a right angle to the wind shear direction.|$|E
5|$|After 150 {{million years}} of volcanism, plutonism, metamorphism, and thrust {{faulting}} had run <b>their</b> <b>course,</b> {{the early part}} of the Cenozoic era (early Tertiary, 6530 Ma) was a time of repose; neither igneous nor sedimentary rocks of this age are known here. A relatively featureless plain was created from erosion over many millions of years. Deposition resumed some 35 Ma in the Oligocene epoch on a flood plain that developed in the area; sluggish streams migrated laterally over the surface, laying down cobbles, sand, and mud. Outcrops of the resulting conglomerates, sandstone, and mudstone of the Titus Canyon Formation can be observed in road cuts at Daylight Pass on Daylight Pass Road, which becomes State Route 374 a short distance from the pass. Several other similar formations were also laid down.|$|E

5|$|After the Treaty of Ryswick ended {{war between}} the French and English in 1697, the French {{continued}} to make war on the Iroquois (primarily through their Algonquian allies in the Great Lakes region), and inflicted significant casualties on them. The Iroquois sought {{the assistance of the}} English to combat this, threatening to make peace with the French if they did not receive help. Bellomont and French Governor General Louis-Hector de Callière both claimed dominance over the Iroquois, and each refused to acknowledge the other's right to intercede on their behalf. When Callière summoned the Iroquois to Montreal for negotiations in 1699, Bellomont was alerted, and successfully manoeuvred the Iroquois into not going by sending an emissary to Montreal and troops to Albany under Lieutenant Governor Nanfan. The English emissary was unsuccessful in swaying the French from <b>their</b> <b>course</b> of action, and French-allied Algonquians made incursions deep into Iroquois territory in 1700.|$|E
5|$|At 9:50 {{and under}} heavy {{pressure}} from the Greek fleet, the Ottoman ships completed a 16-point turn, which reversed <b>their</b> <b>course,</b> {{and headed for the}} safety of the straits. The turn was poorly conducted, and the ships fell out of formation, blocking each other's fields of fire. Barbaros Hayreddin, Turgut Reis, and Mesudiye took several hits during the battle, though only Barbaros Hayreddin was significantly damaged. By 10:17, both sides had ceased firing and the Ottoman fleet withdrew into the Dardanelles. When they approached the straits, Mesudiye and Âsâr-ı Tevfik took up positions to cover the withdrawal of the damaged pre-dreadnoughts. The ships reached port by 13:00 and transferred their casualties to the hospital ship Resit Paşa.|$|E
5|$|Despite the dissatisfaction {{of the men}} in the SWPA, the {{demobilisation}} and repatriation process generally proceeded smoothly. Most men {{had been}} returned to Australia by January 1946 and 80 percent were demobilised by the middle of the year. Before leaving the military service men and women attended either a dispersal centre or naval depot where they were provided with a medical examination, interviewed by a rehabilitation officer and provided with information about the benefits they were eligible for. The Manpower Directorate was then responsible for placing discharged personnel in employment as well as providing them with identity documentation and ration entitlements. Training courses were made available to veterans, and by 1951 94,000 had completed university, technical or rural training courses and 39,000 were still in training. A further 135,000 began training but withdrew before completing <b>their</b> <b>course.</b>|$|E

5|$|I./LG 1 {{abandoned}} Boscombe Down and bombed Southampton instead. No. 238 Squadron {{had been}} detailed to intercept, but the fighter escort was too strong and the bombers were not diverted from <b>their</b> <b>course.</b> Several warehouses were destroyed {{and a cold}} storage plant was also knocked out. All fires were under control by dusk. One III./LG 1 dropped its bombs by RAF Middle Wallop Sector Station by mistake. Only Andover airfield was hit, and it was used for bomber operations, not fighters. III./LG 1 lost two Ju 88s. The 13 Ju 88 Gruppen (Groups) had lost six destroyed and many damaged. They had escaped lightly. The bombing succeeded in destroying a bicycle factory, a furniture warehouse and a refrigerated meat depot. Luftwaffe intelligence had not identified the Southampton Spitfire factory—on the waterfront near the docks—as an important target. Poor intelligence suggested it was a bomber factory. Only later, in September, was it attacked and severely damaged. However, even then the Germans were unaware of the damage inflicted to Spitfire production. The factory would later be broken up and production dispersed.|$|E
5|$|The {{expectation}} {{had been}} since the 1920s that undergraduates would spend {{at least one of}} their years living in College; however, post-war expectations grew and Brasenose began another construction programme to ensure it could house students for longer. Designs were drawn up by Philip Powell and Hidalgo Moya, in a then-modern style. The new buildings cost £76,000 to design, housing 32 rooms, and forming staircases XVI, XVII and XVIII. The architecture, which has since come to be thoroughly disliked, was praised. The rather more popular rooms on the Frewin site were also constructed, at a total cost of £3million, including commercial units. In 1996, the St Cross Building was finished; in 1997 the final extensions to Frewin were completed, allowing the college to house all undergraduates for the duration of <b>their</b> <b>course.</b> Finances had been secured with a late revival, and accounts early in the twenty-first century showed a 6% surplus and a ranking of 13th out of 36th in endowment income.|$|E

Many sections were restored during the 1980s, with financial support from UNESCO, but the restoration program has been criticized for destroying historical evidence, focusing on superficial restoration, the use of inappropriate materials and poor quality of work. This became apparent in the 1999 earthquakes, when the restored sections collapsed while the original structure underneath remained intact. The threat posed by urban pollution, and the lack of a comprehensive restoration effort, prompted the World Monuments Fund to include them on its 2008 Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites in the world.|$|E

5|$|Being {{somewhat}} delayed, Charles {{broke up}} his winter quarters at Blonie on January 9, 1706 and approached Grodno {{with the main}} Swedish army of 20,000 men and the 10,000 Poles and Lithuanians. A Russian army of 28,000 men was stationed there. Bad weather prevented him from marching out earlier. Urgently seeking battle Charles seemed to walk straight into the trap the allies had set for him, according to their initial plan. In Saxony, Schulenburg still waited with his 20,000 men to cross the Polish border and engage Rehnskiöld. He planned to move with his army {{as soon as he}} got word of Charles crossing the Vistula river. However, Charles commenced with a rapid winter march; this was typical for the Swedes, dating back to the time of Gustavus Adolphus, but quite unusual for continental armies. This in turn surprised the allies as they believed Charles would not begin his march before spring. Having received word of his approach however, they considered three alternatives; to meet Charles' army in the open field, fortify in Grodno, or retreat. While they disagreed among themselves about <b>their</b> <b>course</b> of action Charles' army appeared before the fortifications of Grodno on January 24, after a quick march, forcing the allies to stay in the city. Prior to the Swedish arrival, Augustus who had thus far accompanied the Russian army, broke away with 5,000 cavalry. He strove to increase his troops with another 3,000 men before uniting forces with Sculenburg and the Saxon main army whose only obstacle in order to attack Charles' army in the rear, accordingly, were the 10,000 men under Rehnskiöld stationed at Poznań.|$|E
5|$|Lion's {{share of}} Ireland has with most likehood been {{above sea level}} during the last 60 million years. As such its landscapes have been shaped by erosion and {{weathering}} on land. Protracted erosion does also means most of the Paleogene and Neogene sediments have been eroded away or, as known in a few cases, buried by Quaternary deposits. Before the Quaternary glaciations affected Ireland the landscape had developed thick weathered regolith on the uplands and karst in the lowlands. There have been some controversy regarding {{the origin of the}} planation surfaces found on Ireland. While some have argued for an origin in marine planation others regard these surfaces as peneplains formed by weathering and fluvial erosion. Not only is their origin disputed but also their actual extent and the relative role of sea-level change and tectonics in their shaping. Most river systems in Ireland formed in the Cenozoic before the Quaternary glaciations. Rivers follow for most of <b>their</b> <b>course</b> structural features of the geology of Ireland. Marine erosion since the Miocene might have made Ireland's western coast retreat more than 100 km. Pre-Quaternary relief was more dramatic than today's glacier-smoothened landscapes.|$|E
5|$|The Balkan League, {{of which}} Greece was a member, {{declared}} war on the Ottoman Empire in October 1912. Two months later, the Ottoman fleet attacked the Greek navy, {{in an attempt to}} disrupt the naval blockade surrounding the Dardanelles. The Ottoman fleet, which included Turgut Reis, Barbaros Hayreddin, the outdated ironclad battleships Mesudiye and Âsâr-ı Tevfik, nine destroyers, and six torpedo boats, sortied from the Dardanelles at 9:30. The smaller ships remained {{at the mouth of the}} straits while the battleships sailed north, remaining near to the coast. The Greek flotilla, which included the armored cruiser Georgios Averof and Psara and her sisters, had been sailing from the island of Imbros to the patrol line outside the straits. When the Ottomans were sighted, the Greeks altered course to the northeast in order to block the advance of their opponents. In the ensuing Naval Battle of Elli, the Ottoman ships opened fire first, at 9:50, from a range of about 15,000yards; the Greeks returned fire ten minutes later, by which time the range had decreased significantly to 8,500yards. At 10:04, the Ottoman ships completed a 16-point turn, which reversed <b>their</b> <b>course,</b> and steamed for the safety of the straits in a disorganized withdrawal. Within an hour, the routed Ottoman ships had withdrawn into the Dardanelles.|$|E
