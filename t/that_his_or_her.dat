5|$|The High Court {{rejected}} the plaintiffs' argument that, by compulsorily acquiring a temple, the Government was limiting a person's right under Article 15(1) of the Constitution to profess, practice and propagate {{his or her}} religion, and that this in turn gave him or her {{the legal right to}} commence an action on the ground that where an individual's constitutional rights are affected, he or she has a sufficient interest to ensure <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> rights are protected. The court ruling held that this land acquisition matter was not in any way related to religious freedom. Because the acquisition was not related to religious freedom, the High Court found that only the trustees who were the legal owners of the temple property had the requisite locus standi to institute proceedings if they deemed their rights to have been infringed.|$|E

25|$|Although this {{statutory}} definition broadly corresponds to its common law counterpart, {{there are two}} key differences. First, unlike the common law offence which requires evidence of a seditious intent, an offender's intention is irrelevant under the Sedition Act, and it suffices that the act possesses the requisite seditious tendency. Thus, it is immaterial that the offender failed to foresee or misjudged the risk <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> act would be seditious.|$|E

25|$|In the 1993 case of Kamal Jit Singh v. Minister for Home Affairs, the Court of Appeal of Singapore {{stated that}} {{validity}} of detention is {{not dependent on}} the subjective satisfaction of the authorities. Therefore, a court is entitled {{to determine whether there}} are objective grounds for the Minister's satisfaction that a person has been associated with criminal activities and <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> detention is necessary. On the other hand, it was held by the High Court in Re Wong Sin Yee that the judicial process is unsuitable for reaching decisions on questions of public safety, peace and good order. Therefore, the court will not quash the Minister's decision to detain a person unless it is so outrageous in its defiance of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it.|$|E
25|$|Consciousness is {{described}} as a state of being, very closely related to God. The consciousness within the normal person is said to be 97% asleep. Consciousness asleep is consciousness that is subconscious, unconscious, or infraconscious, which are various levels of psychological sleep. Psychological sleep is a way to describe the lack of self-awareness, meaning that the common and ordinary person is not aware of 97% of what constitutes the ordinary state of being. A consciousness asleep is caused by what Aun Weor calls identification, fascination, or the incorrect transformation of impressions, which all imply a type of consciousness that is not aware of its own processes. It is said that to awaken consciousness one must understand <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> consciousness is asleep. This implies that one must begin to understand every impulse, action, thought and movement one makes, a feat that is said to be accomplished through the mental discipline of meditation and self-observation. Furthermore, it is stated that the awakening of consciousness {{is the only way to}} acquiring gnosis and achieve a true and radical change by removing the spurious psychological aggregates that cause unnecessary suffering. The awakening of consciousness goes hand in hand with the transmutation of sexual energy because the higher states of consciousness depend upon the energy of sexual transmutation.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "first-past-the-post" [...] voting system, {{also known}} as the simple {{plurality}} voting system, is used in Singapore for electing the President as well as Members of the Parliament. This system has been criticized as undemocratic because the eventual winner may have won only a minority of the total votes cast, despite having secured the most number of votes in absolute terms among all the candidates. Thus, there might be cases where an elected politician can be said to have won the mandate of only a minority of voters, and <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> election is therefore not an accurate reflection of the voters' will. As constitutional lawyer Sir William Wade has said: [...] "If it is accepted that a democratic Parliament ought to represent so far as possible the preferences of the voters, this system is probably the worst that could be devised." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon I Will Be Invincible takes characters, settings, and storylines {{generally}} {{associated with}} the comic book format and re-casts them using the novel's prose format. This use of superhero fiction in an alternate format was compared to other similar, successful attempts, like Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films, Brad Bird's The Incredibles, and the TV serial No Heroics. Several reviewers contrasted the novel's elements of realism with Alan Moore's Watchmen and Rick Veitch's Bratpack which portrayed a darker side of more realistic superheroes. Novels cited as being similar included Donald Barthelme's Snow White, Robert Coover's Stepmother, and the works of Michael Chabon and Jonathan Lethem. The novel format allowed for more character development, which Grossman took advantage of by portraying them as [...] "real, human characters, {{with all of the}} foibles that come with the territory" [...] in what one reviewer called a [...] "hybridization of character and genre". Grossman described it as [...] "a book about real people who happen to be [...] or supervillains" [...] and that if it were a comic, it would be [...] "page after page of thought balloons". Compared to comic stories, the reviewer for the Richmond Times-Dispatch wrote [...] "The common denominator for most superhero comic books is that they don't make fun of themselves - the believability of their stories is never called into question. They take the heroes seriously. Not so in literature. When a novel appears with comic books as its focus, its author will undoubtedly believe <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> theme is far more important - far more serious - than the comic books that inspired them. ... tries to do it all, combining humor and comic-book adventure with a literary sense of character. ...The result is a postmodern, inventive, comic-book plot with literary aspirations, and its only problem is that it isn't entirely successful as either humor or as straight adventure." ...|$|E
