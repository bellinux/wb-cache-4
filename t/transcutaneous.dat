5|$|Exercise {{therapy is}} {{effective}} in decreasing pain and improving function for those with chronic low back pain. It also appears to reduce recurrence rates {{for as long as}} six months after the completion of program and improves long-term function. There is no evidence that one particular type of exercise therapy is more effective than another. The Alexander technique appears useful for chronic back pain, and there is tentative evidence to support the use of yoga. <b>Transcutaneous</b> electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has not been found to be effective in chronic low back pain. Evidence for the use of shoe insoles as a treatment is inconclusive. Peripheral nerve stimulation, a minimally-invasive procedure, may be useful in cases of chronic low back pain that do not respond to other measures, although the evidence supporting it is not conclusive, and it is not effective for pain that radiates into the leg.|$|E

25|$|Physical and {{occupational}} therapy show low quality {{evidence to support}} their use. Physical therapy interventions may include <b>transcutaneous</b> electrical nerve stimulation, progressive weight bearing, tactile desensitization, massage, and contrast bath therapy.|$|E
25|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} {{can also}} {{be applied to the}} anal sphincters and pelvic floor muscles, inducing muscle contraction without traditional exercises (similar to <b>transcutaneous</b> electrical nerve stimulation, TENS). The evidence supporting its use is limited, and any benefit is tentative. In light of the above, intra-anal electrical stimulation (using an anal probe as electrode) appears to be more efficacious than intra-vaginal (using a vaginal probe as electrode). Rarely, skin reactions may occur where the electrodes are placed, but these issues typically resolve when the stimulation is stopped. Surgically implanted sacral nerve stimulation may be more effective than exercises, and electrical stimulation and biofeedback may be more effective than exercises or electrical stimulation by themselves. TENS is also sometimes used to treat FI by <b>transcutaneous</b> tibial nerve stimulation.|$|E
25|$|Paramedics, {{represents}} {{the highest level}} of EMT, and in general, {{the highest level of}} prehospital medical provider, though some areas utilize physicians as providers on air ambulances or as a ground provider. Paramedics perform a variety of medical procedures such as endotracheal intubation, fluid resuscitation, drug administration, obtaining intravenous access, cardiac monitoring (continuous and 12-lead), cardioversion, <b>transcutaneous</b> pacing, cricothyrotomy, manual defibrillation, chest needle decompression, and other advanced procedures and assessments.|$|E
25|$|Silver {{chloride}} electrodes {{are also}} used by many applications of biological electrode systems such as biomonitoring sensors as part of electrocardiography (ECG) and electroencephalography (EEG), and in <b>transcutaneous</b> electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) to deliver current. Historically, the electrodes were fabricated from solid materials such as silver, brass coated with silver, tin and nickel. In today's applications, most biomonitoring electrodes are silver/silver chloride sensors which are fabricated by coating {{a thin layer of}} silver on plastic substrates and the outer layer of silver is converted to silver chloride.|$|E
25|$|Transvenous pacing, {{when used}} for {{temporary}} pacing, {{is an alternative}} to <b>transcutaneous</b> pacing. A pacemaker wire is placed into a vein, under sterile conditions, and then passed into either the right atrium or right ventricle. The pacing wire is then connected to an external pacemaker outside the body. Transvenous pacing is often used as a bridge to permanent pacemaker placement. It can be kept in place until a permanent pacemaker is implanted or until {{there is no longer}} a need for a pacemaker and then it is removed.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, Canadian {{electrical}} engineer John Hopps {{designed and built}} the first external pacemaker based upon observations by cardio-thoracic surgeon's Wilfred Gordon Bigelow and John Callaghan at Toronto General Hospital, although the device was first tested at the University of Toronto's Banting Institute on a dog. A substantial external device using vacuum tube technology to provide <b>transcutaneous</b> pacing, it was somewhat crude and painful to the patient in use and, being powered from an AC wall socket, carried a potential hazard of electrocution of the patient and inducing ventricular fibrillation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transcutaneous</b> pacing (TCP), {{also called}} {{external}} pacing, {{is recommended for}} the initial stabilization of hemodynamically significant bradycardias of all types. The procedure is performed by placing two pacing pads on the patient's chest, either in the anterior/lateral position or the anterior/posterior position. The rescuer selects the pacing rate, and gradually increases the pacing current (measured in mA) until electrical capture (characterized by a wide QRS complex with a tall, broad T wave on the ECG) is achieved, with a corresponding pulse. Pacing artifact on the ECG and severe muscle twitching may make this determination difficult. External pacing should not be relied upon {{for an extended period}} of time. It is an emergency procedure that acts as a bridge until transvenous pacing or other therapies can be applied.|$|E
25|$|Human skin {{has a low}} permeability; that is, most foreign {{substances}} {{are unable}} to penetrate and diffuse through the skin. Skin's outermost layer, the stratum corneum, is an effective barrier to most inorganic nanosized particles. This protects the body from external particles such as toxins by not allowing them to {{come into contact with}} internal tissues. However, in some cases it is desirable to allow particles entry to the body through the skin. Potential medical applications of such particle transfer has prompted developments in nanomedicine and biology to increase skin permeability. One application of <b>transcutaneous</b> particle delivery could be to locate and treat cancer. Nanomedical researchers seek to target the epidermis and other layers of active cell division where nanoparticles can interact directly with cells that have lost their growth-control mechanisms (cancer cells). Such direct interaction could be used to more accurately diagnose properties of specific tumors or to treat them by delivering drugs with cellular specificity.|$|E
25|$|The Advanced Care Paramedic is a {{level of}} {{practitioner}} that is in high demand by many services across Canada. However, still not all provinces and jurisdictions have ACPs (Quebec, New Brunswick). The ACP typically carries approximately 20 different medications, although the number and type of medications may vary substantially from region to region. ACPs perform advanced airway management including intubation, surgical airways, intravenous therapy, place external jugular IV lines, perform needle thoracotomy, perform and interpret 12-lead ECGs, perform synchronized and chemical cardioversion, <b>transcutaneous</b> pacing, perform obstetrical assessments, and provide pharmacological pain relief for various conditions. Several sites in Canada have adopted pre-hospital fibrinolytics and rapid sequence induction, and prehospital medical research has permitted {{a great number of}} variations in the scope of practice for ACPs. Current programs include providing ACPs with discretionary direct 24-hour access to PCI labs, bypassing the emergency department, and representing a fundamental change in both the way that patients with S-T segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI) are treated, but also profoundly affecting survival rates. as well as bypassing a closer hospitals to get an identified stroke patient to a stroke centre.|$|E
500|$|Polonium {{is highly}} {{dangerous}} {{and has no}} biological role. By mass, polonium-210 is around 250,000 times more toxic than hydrogen cyanide (the [...] for 210Po is less than 1 microgram for an average adult (see below) compared with about 250 milligrams for hydrogen cyanide). The main hazard is its intense radioactivity (as an alpha emitter), which {{makes it difficult to}} handle safely. Even in microgram amounts, handling 210Po is extremely dangerous, requiring specialized equipment (a negative pressure alpha glove box equipped with high-performance filters), adequate monitoring, and strict handling procedures to avoid any contamination. Alpha particles emitted by polonium will damage organic tissue easily if polonium is ingested, inhaled, or absorbed, although they do not penetrate the epidermis and hence are not hazardous as long as the alpha particles remain outside the body. Wearing chemically resistant and intact gloves is a mandatory precaution to avoid <b>transcutaneous</b> diffusion of polonium directly through the skin. Polonium delivered in concentrated nitric acid can easily diffuse through inadequate gloves (e.g., latex gloves) or the acid may damage the gloves.|$|E

2500|$|Immediate though {{temporary}} {{relief of}} piriformis syndrome {{can usually be}} brought about by injection of a local anaesthetic into the piriformis muscle. [...] Symptomatic relief of muscle and nerve pain can also sometimes be obtained by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or muscle relaxants, though {{the use of such}} medication or even more powerful prescription medication for relief of sciatica is often assessed by patients to be largely ineffective at relieving pain. Conservative treatment usually begins with stretching exercises, myofascial release, massage, and avoidance of contributory activities such as running, bicycling, rowing, heavy lifting, etc. Some clinicians recommend formal physical therapy, including soft tissue mobilization, hip joint mobilization, teaching stretching techniques, and strengthening of the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and biceps femoris to reduce strain on the piriformis. More advanced physical therapy treatment can include pelvic-trochanter isometric stretching, hip abductor, external rotator and extensor strengthening exercises, [...] <b>transcutaneous</b> electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and massage physiotherapy of the piriformis muscle region. One study of 14 people with what appeared to be piriformis syndrome indicated that rehabilitation programs that included physical therapy, low doses of muscle relaxants and pain relief medication were effective at alleviating most muscle and nerve pain caused by what the research subjects had been told was piriformis syndrome. [...] However, as this study included very few individuals and did not have a control group not receiving treatment (both serious methodological flaws), it provides no insight as to whether the pain in the piriformis would have simply dissipated on its own without any treatment at all and is therefore not only uninformative, it may actually be misleading. The injury is considered largely self-limiting and spontaneous recovery is usually on the order of a few days or a week to six weeks or longer if left untreated.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Transcutaneous</b> pacing (also called {{external}} pacing) is {{a temporary}} means of pacing a patient's heart during a medical emergency.

By convention, a heart rate of less than 60 beats per minute in the adult patient is called bradycardia. [...] Not all instances of bradycardia require medical treatment. Normal heart rate varies substantially between individuals, and many athletes in particular have a relatively slow resting heart rate.
