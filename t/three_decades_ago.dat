500|$|Frusciante's guitar playing employs {{emphasis}} on appropriate melody, tone, and structure rather than virtuosity. Although virtuoso influences {{can be heard}} throughout his career, {{he has said that}} he often minimizes this. He feels that in general, guitar mastery has not evolved much since the 1960s and considers the greatest players of that decade unsurpassed. When he was growing up in the 1980s, many mainstream guitarists focused on speed. Because of this, he thinks that the skills of many defiant new wave and punk guitarists were largely overlooked. Therefore, he accentuates the melodically-driven technique of players such as Matthew Ashman of Bow Wow Wow and Bernard Sumner of Joy Division as much as possible because he thinks that their style has been overlooked and consequently underexplored. Despite this, he considers himself a fan of technique-driven guitarists like Randy Rhoads and Steve Vai, but represses an urge to emulate their style: [...] "People believe that by playing faster and creating new playing techniques you can progress forward, but then they realize that emotionally they don't progress at all. They transmit nothing to the people listening and they stay at where Hendrix was <b>three</b> <b>decades</b> <b>ago.</b> Something like that happened to Vai in the 80s." [...] Believing that focusing only on [...] "clean tones" [...] is negative, Frusciante developed an interest in playing with what he calls a [...] "grimy" [...] sound. As a result, he considers it beneficial to [...] "mistreat" [...] his guitar and employ various forms of distortion when soloing. He also tries to break as many [...] "stylistic boundaries" [...] as he can to expand his musical horizons. He thinks that much of the output from today's guitarists is unoriginal, and that many of his contemporaries [...] "follow the rules with no risk".|$|E

[...] Patent-eligible processes do not include [...] "laws of nature, natural phenomena, [...] abstract ideas." [...] The limiting legal principle applies not just to processes, but to anything on which a patent is sought.

Also, the alumni overwhelmingly report favorable assessments of their orphanage experiences.

Patients have special characteristics that differ from those with rheumatic mitral valve disease we still see in developed countries.

In these situations, the rate of complications associated to valve replacement is significantly increased.

40|$|The chapter applies a {{historical}} institutionalist perspective to analyse {{the dynamics of}} market regulation in the European Union. It shows how an institutionalist perspective allows a deep understanding of the feedback loops that affected the preferences of European stakeholders and transformed initially insignificant agreements into profound changes that became visible only with time. Using the internal market for network industries as an example, it hows how European regulation expanded and was transformed from a very limited and often non-binding set of policies to an integrated and wide-ranging framework that sees rules for liberalisation and re-regulation of competition, together with new EU-level regulators. The long-term perspective of historical institutionalism highlights that this incremental but profound change was possible because critical junctures, in particular judgments by the European Court of justice, allowed the European Commission and its allies to advance new policy proposals with a new default position. This in turn affected the preferences of major member states and created new coalitions. In addition, initial agreements {{led to the emergence}} of new actors. Taken together, the feedback loops reinforced the orientation of previous agreements and created changes that most observers would have qualified as impossible <b>three</b> or four <b>decades</b> <b>ago...</b>|$|R
