5|$|After {{the end of}} the Anarchy, {{the number}} of small towns in England began to {{increase}} sharply. By 1297, 120 new towns had been established, and in 1350 – by when the expansion had effectively ceased – there were around 500 towns in England. Many of these new towns were centrally planned: Richard I created Portsmouth, John founded Liverpool, and successive monarchs followed with Harwich, Stony Stratford, Dunstable, Royston, Baldock, Wokingham, Maidenhead and Reigate. The new towns were usually located with access to trade routes in mind, rather than defence, and the streets were laid out to make access to the town's market convenient. A growing percentage of England's population lived in urban areas; estimates suggest that this rose from around 5.5% in 1086 <b>to</b> <b>up</b> to 10% in 1377.|$|E

5|$|Bacteria often {{attach to}} {{surfaces}} and form dense aggregations called biofilms, and larger formations known as microbial mats. These biofilms and mats {{can range from}} a few micrometres in thickness <b>to</b> <b>up</b> to half a metre in depth, and may contain multiple species of bacteria, protists and archaea. Bacteria living in biofilms display a complex arrangement of cells and extracellular components, forming secondary structures, such as microcolonies, through which there are networks of channels to enable better diffusion of nutrients. In natural environments, such as soil or the surfaces of plants, the majority of bacteria are bound to surfaces in biofilms. Biofilms are also important in medicine, as these structures are often present during chronic bacterial infections or in infections of implanted medical devices, and bacteria protected within biofilms are much harder to kill than individual isolated bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{take place}} on a grid-based battle arena, with {{characters}} and enemies moving according to their position on the grid. Four commands are available to the party: Attack (fight enemies), Contact (talk with an enemy), Analyze (check an enemy for its strength and weaknesses), and Form (rearrange the party on the grid). The character's main means of attack is their Persona, beings summoned into battle to cast a spell that can heal the party, and inflict physical or elemental damage on an enemy. Each Persona has access <b>to</b> <b>up</b> to eight skills, and each character can change their Persona during their turn. Personas earn experience points independent of the characters they are assigned to, and gain new abilities through extended use. Experience is awarded based on how often the player uses certain characters or Personas. Alongside their Personas, each character is able to attack with an equipped melee weapon or firearm, use an item, or attempt {{to talk with the}} demons that act as the game's standard enemies.|$|E
5|$|Before a {{translation}} is greenlit and translators are allocated for each language, the localization, quality assurance (QA) and marketing staff play through a build {{of the game}} and sometimes do a focus group study. The localization team's playthrough can sometimes take over 100 hours of gameplay. Once the company greenlights a localization project, a period of brainstorming starts in which glossary, style, naming schemes and fonts are chosen. During the translation phase, voiced sections are translated first. Text files are cross-checked by multiple translators and editors. The text is then integrated along with any graphic and sound changes, and the game goes to quality assurance. During a period of several weeks <b>to</b> <b>up</b> to three months, Japanese QA teams look for bugs while Western QA teams check linguistic issues. The localization team often re-plays the game during this phase, translates the manuals and help out on the guidebooks if these are made. Finally, the game is sent to the hardware manufacturers to be approved.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{qualitative and quantitative}} chromatographic analysis (GC/MS) of the lipophilic fraction extracted from leaves, inflorescences and rhizomes of Silphium perfoliatum L. collected in 1998 - 2000. It was shown that the extracts of leaves and inflorescences are similar in composition, containing among their main constituents: α-amyrine (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 13. 9 % of total components in leaves, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 11. 3 % in inflorescences), heptacosane (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 7. 1 % in leaves, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 7. 6 % in inflorescences), stigmasterol (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 8. 1 % in leaves, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 2. 2 % in inflorescences), γ-sitosterol (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 6. 9 % in leaves, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 2. 2 % in inflorescences), β-amyrine (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 4. 1 % in leaves, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 5. 8 % in inflorescences), β-caryophyllene (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 2. 6 % in leaves, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 1. 5 % in inflorescences), caryophyllene oxide (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 4. 4 % in leaves, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 2. 9 % in inflorescences), germacrene D (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 13. 8 % in leaves, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 9. 7 % in inflorescences) and α-pinene (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 3. 3 % in leaves, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 2. 4 % in inflorescences).

The following compounds can be counted among the dominant ones occurring in rhizome extracts: diterpene of labdane type - 16 -acetoxycarterochaetol (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 45 %) and sesquiterpenes - 7 -b-H-silphiperfol- 5 -ene (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 9. 1 %), 7 -a-H-silphiperfol- 5 -ene (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 10. 7 %), d-elemene (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 7. 6 %), isocomene (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 5. 6 %), germacrene D (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 5. 2 %) and modhephene (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 5. 1 %) ...|$|R

5|$|Christine Collins {{was placed}} in Los Angeles County Hospital by Captain Jones. After her release, she sued the police {{department}} twice, winning the second lawsuit. Although Captain Jones was ordered to pay Collins $10,800, he never did. A city council welfare hearing recommended that Jones and Chief of Police James E. Davis leave their posts, but both were later reinstated. The California State Legislature later made it illegal {{for the police to}} commit someone to a psychiatric facility without a warrant. Northcott was convicted of the murders of Lewis Winslow (12), Nelson Winslow (10) and an unidentified Mexican boy; after his conviction, Northcott was reported to have admitted <b>to</b> <b>up</b> to 20 murders, though he later denied the claim. Northcott was executed by hanging in 1930 at the age of 23. Sarah Louise was convicted of Walter Collins' murder and served almost 12 years in prison.

5|$|Cumulative {{friendly}} casualties for Operation Scotland, {{which began}} on 1 November 1967, were: 205 killed in action, 1,668 wounded, and 25 missing and presumed dead.

As far as North Vietnamese casualties were concerned, 1,602 bodies were counted, seven prisoners were taken, and two soldiers defected to allied forces during the operation. American intelligence estimated that between 10,000 and 15,000 NVA troops were killed during the operation, equating <b>to</b> <b>up</b> to 90% of the attacking 17,200 men NVA force. The NVA acknowledged 2,500 men killed in action.

5|$|In 1969, Austrian {{paleontologist}} Georg Haas {{concluded that}} despite the large size of ankylosaur skulls, the associated musculature was relatively weak. He also thought jaw movement was limited <b>to</b> <b>up</b> and down movements. Extrapolating from this, Haas suggested that ankylosaurs ate relatively soft non-abrasive vegetation. Later research on Euoplocephalus indicates that forward and sideways jaw movement was possible in these animals, the skull being able to withstand considerable forces. A 2016 study of the dental occlusion (contact between the teeth) of ankylosaur specimens found that the ability for backwards (palinal) jaw movement evolved independently in different ankylosaur linages, including Late Cretaceous North American ankylosaurids like Ankylosaurus and Euoplocephalus.|$|E

That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the Adoption and Safe Families Act and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the Foster Care Independence Act. He negotiated the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by the Republican Congress. In October 1997, he announced he was getting hearing aids, due to hearing loss attributed to his age, and his time spent as a musician in his youth. In 1999 Clinton signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which repealed the part of the Glass–Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933.|$|E
