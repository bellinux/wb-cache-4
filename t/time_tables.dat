25|$|This is the discography of the German Synthpop duo Modern Talking. The duo have {{released}} their materials {{over a period}} of two separate <b>time</b> <b>tables,</b> first between 1984-1987, then the duo found itself reunified in 1998 and made a successful comeback releasing another batch of materials between 1998-2003. Modern Talking's sound; however, was rather different from their original 1980s sound after their reunion. The duo came back in 1998 switching from their original 1980s mellow Europop sound to 1990s uptempo Eurodance sound, which was in high demand in central Europe at the time.|$|E

The study examines {{the use of the}} “Vedic Method” to do multiplication problems involving <b>times</b> <b>tables</b> more than five by making use of <b>times</b> <b>tables</b> from zero to five. Hence, the five participants chosen were pupils who demonstrated an ability to recall their one to five <b>times</b> <b>table</b> but had difficulties recalling the six to nine <b>times</b> <b>tables.</b> The participants of the research were able to overcome their difficulties {{with the use of the}} “Vedic Method...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMastering long {{division}} algorithm {{requires a}} good understanding of the meaning of division, knowledge of the <b>times</b> <b>tables,</b> subtraction skills and also the ability to estimate because it comprises several important principles. Using “Big Number Times Tables” (BNTT) can make the teaching and learning of long division algorithm much easier. BNTT needs children to only memorizing <b>times</b> <b>tables</b> up to table 9. Instead of doing trial and error as they normally do, children are guided to build the <b>times</b> <b>tables</b> systematically and they can build their own <b>times</b> <b>tables</b> with bigger number. Results of the early research show that majority children chose to use big number <b>times</b> <b>table</b> to solve problems because they make less error. Since BNTT guides children to build <b>times</b> <b>tables</b> in a systematic way, this gives the children the confidence to proceed with all the problems given. Teachers also find this technique very helpful. Furthermore, once anyone understands the steps being taken, BNTT can be used not only with one or two digits numbers but it can be applied with any bigger number which has more than two digits...|$|R
25|$|Electronic paper, {{also called}} e-paper, is a display {{technology}} designed {{to mimic the}} appearance of ordinary ink on paper. Electronic paper reflects light like ordinary paper and is capable of holding text and images indefinitely without drawing electricity, while allowing the image to be changed later. Applications of e-paper technology include e-book readers capable of displaying digital versions of books, magazines and newspapers, electronic pricing labels in retail shops, <b>time</b> <b>tables</b> at bus stations, and electronic billboards. Electronic paper was invented in 1973 by Nick Sheridon at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center. The first electronic paper, called Gyricon, consisted of polyethylene spheres between 75 and 106 micrometres across.|$|E

[...] As a common carrier it was subject to rules of the California Railroad Commission, so there are published <b>time</b> <b>tables</b> and tariffs for this period. [...] However, unlike most common carriers, {{the president of the}} railroad was San Francisco Mayor James Rolph, and the {{vice president and general manager}} was the construction project's chief engineer Michael O'Shaughnessy. [...] Revenue to support operation of the railroad was generated by charging timber companies and others along the line for freight. [...] The line also carried mail for those in the area.|$|E

60|$|At length the omnibus {{approached}} the station. It entered through a magnificent portal, under an arch. There {{was a soldier}} walking back and forth, with his musket in his hand, bayonet fixed, to guard the entrance. None but actual travellers were allowed to enter. The omnibus, having entered the court, stopped before a splendid portico, {{where there was a}} door leading into the building. The passengers paid their fares, and got out. On entering the building, they found themselves in a spacious apartment, with a great variety of partitions, offices, enclosures, and railings, presenting themselves on every hand, the meaning of all which {{it was very difficult to}} understand. There were also signs marked first class, and second class, and third class, and placards of notices to travellers, and <b>time</b> <b>tables,</b> and various similar things. On the back side of the room were doors and windows, looking out to a platform, where the train of cars was seen, apparently all ready to set off. But the partitions and railings which were in the way prevented the company from going out there.|$|E
60|$|But if the King's apartments are sumptuous, {{they are}} as nothing to the Hall of Mirrors, the {{showroom}} of the whole palace, and estimated {{to be the most}} magnificent single room in the world. It extends clear across the end of the rear wing and has a length of 236 feet. It is lighted by vast windows that reach almost to the lofty arch that forms its ceiling; the floor is of polished inlaid wood, on which there stood in Louis the Great's <b>time,</b> <b>tables,</b> chairs, and other furniture of solid silver. The whole inner side of the room is formed by seventeen enormous mirrors set in spaces to correspond in shape to the window opposite, and fitted in between with polished marble. Above them runs a cornice of glittering gilt, and over that again the ceiling curves in a great arch, each panel of it bearing some picture to recall the victories of the Grand Monarch. Ungrateful posterity has somewhat forgotten the tremendous military achievements of Louis XIV--the hardships of his campaign in the Netherlands in which the staff of the royal cuisine was cut down to one hundred cooks--the passage of the Rhine, in which the King actually crossed the river {{from one side to the}} other, and so on. But the student of history can live again the triumphs of Louis in this Hall of Mirrors. It is an irony of history that in this room, after the conquest of 1871, the King of Prussia was proclaimed German Emperor by his subjects and his allies.|$|E

Exam scheduling is part of <b>time</b> <b>table</b> problem with bit differences in both like in case of <b>time</b> <b>table</b> problem one lecture can be needed to schedule 3 or more times a week while in exam scheduling one exam is needed to schedule only once. In case of exam scheduling there are two cases, first with student can have exam of two or more subjects consecutively and in second, student can’t have exam of two or more subjects consecutively. In this paper it is attempted to do comparison between two ways to schedule exam based on graph coloring approach for both cases mentioned above...|$|R
