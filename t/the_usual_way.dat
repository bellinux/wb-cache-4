5|$|The {{approach}} in these sheep experiments involves irradiating a ram’s testes while placing {{stem cells from}} a second ram into the testes of the first, ram A. In the following weeks ram A produces semen <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> <b>way,</b> but is using the stem cells of ram B and therefore producing semen carrying the genetics of ram B rather than those of his own. Ram A therefore has effectively become a surrogate ram.|$|E

2500|$|Bonding and {{earthing}} are <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> <b>ways</b> charge buildup can be prevented. For fluids with {{electrical conductivity}} below 10 pS/m, bonding and earthing are not adequate for charge dissipation, and anti-static additives may be required.|$|R

25|$|Bart Ehrman {{states that}} what makes science {{possible}} {{is the assumption}} of the uniformity {{of the laws of}} nature, but given that miracles are by definition events that go against <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> <b>way</b> nature works, historians are virtually unable to confirm or refute reports of Jesus' miracles.|$|E
25|$|Such a Korean mixed script became <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> <b>way</b> {{of writing}} the language, with roots of Chinese origin denoted by Hanja {{and all other}} {{elements}} rendered in Hangul. Hanja is still used (but not very commonly like the Japanese) and is required in both North and South Korea.|$|E

25|$|There {{is usually}} no {{obligation}} for stock {{to be issued}} via the stock exchange itself, nor must stock be subsequently traded on the exchange. Such trading may be off exchange or over-the-counter. This is <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> <b>way</b> that derivatives and bonds are traded. Increasingly, stock exchanges {{are part of a}} global securities market.|$|E
25|$|Automorphisms of T {{are easily}} {{constructed}} from automorphisms of the lattice Zn, which are classified by invertible integral matrices of size n with an integral inverse; {{these are just}} the integral matrices with determinant ±1. Making them act on Rn in <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> <b>way,</b> one has the typical toral automorphism on the quotient.|$|E

25|$|In most of {{continental}} Europe and Latin America, {{titles are}} conventionally printed bottom-to-top on the spine so, when {{the books are}} placed vertically on shelves, the title can be read by tilting the head to the left.

25|$|Acamprosate is {{occasionally}} used {{in addition}} to other treatments, and is then carried on into long term use {{to reduce the risk of}} relapse.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>usual</b> <b>way</b> of {{limiting}} sound volume on devices driving headphones is by limiting output power.

25|$|It is also {{possible}} to raise exceptions purposefully, using the throw keyword; these exceptions are handled in <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> <b>way.</b> In some cases, exceptions cannot {{be used due to}} technical reasons. One such example is a critical component of an embedded system, where every operation must be guaranteed to complete within a specified amount of time. This cannot be determined with exceptions as no tools exist to determine the maximum time required for an exception to be handled.|$|E
25|$|Relations and {{functions}} are defined in TST (and in NF and NFU) as sets of ordered pairs in <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> <b>way.</b> The usual {{definition of the}} ordered pair, first proposed by Kuratowski in 1921, has a serious drawback for NF and related theories: the resulting ordered pair necessarily has a type two higher than the type of its arguments (its left and right projections). Hence for purposes of determining stratification, a function is three types higher than the members of its field.|$|E
