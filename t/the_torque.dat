5|$|It {{can also}} be seen however that this simple 2-dimensional model, {{essentially}} an inverted pendulum on a turntable, predicts that the steady-state turn is unstable. If the bike is displaced slightly downwards from its equilibrium lean angle, <b>the</b> <b>torque</b> of gravity increases, that of centrifugal force decreases and the displacement gets amplified. A more-sophisticated model that allows a wheel to steer, adjust the path, and counter <b>the</b> <b>torque</b> of gravity, is necessary to capture the self-stability observed in real bikes.|$|E
5|$|While {{the moment}} from {{gyroscopic}} forces is only 12% of this, it {{can play a}} significant part because it begins to act {{as soon as the}} rider applies <b>the</b> <b>torque,</b> instead of building up more slowly as the wheel out-tracks. This can be especially helpful in motorcycle racing.|$|E

5|$|Four-wheel {{drive was}} decided against {{early in the}} {{development}} process, {{for a number of}} reasons. It was thought rear-wheel drive would be adequate in the majority of situations, that the additional complexity of the four-wheel drive system would hinder the development process and potentially be problematic for the customer. FF Developments were contracted to provide the gearbox/transaxle assembly, modifying their four-wheel drive transaxle assembly from the XJ220 concept into a pure rear-wheel drive design for the production car. A five-speed gearbox is fitted; a six-speed gearbox was considered but deemed unnecessary, as <b>the</b> <b>torque</b> characteristics of the engine made a sixth gear redundant. The transaxle featured a viscous coupling limited slip differential to improve traction.|$|E
5|$|Once a turn is established, <b>the</b> <b>torque</b> {{that must}} {{be applied to the}} {{steering}} mechanism in order to maintain a constant radius at a constant forward speed depends on the forward speed and the geometry and mass distribution of the bike. At speeds below the capsize speed, described below in the section on Eigenvalues and also called the inversion speed, the self-stability of the bike will cause it to tend to steer into the turn, righting itself and exiting the turn, unless a torque is applied in the opposite direction of the turn. At speeds above the capsize speed, the capsize instability will cause it to tend to steer out of the turn, increasing the lean, unless a torque is applied {{in the direction of the}} turn. At the capsize speed no input steering torque is necessary to maintain the steady-state turn.|$|E
5|$|The surface {{friction}} tester {{is a small}} {{fifth wheel}} attached to a hydraulic system mounted on the rear axle of the vehicle, used to measure road slipperiness. The wheel, allowed to roll freely, is slightly turned relative to the ground so that it partially slides. Sensors attached to the axis of the wheel calculate the friction between the wheel and the pavement by measuring <b>the</b> <b>torque</b> produced by {{the rotation of the}} wheel. Surface friction testers are used at airports and on major roadways before ice formation or after snow removal. The vehicle can relay the surface friction data back to the control centre, allowing gritting and clearing to be planned so that the vehicles are deployed most efficiently. Surface friction testers often include a water spraying system, to simulate the effects of rain on the road surface before the rain occurs. The sensors are usually mounted to small compact or estate cars or to a small trailer, rather than the large trucks used for other winter service equipment, as the surface friction tester works best when attached to a lightweight vehicle.|$|E

The equations of electromechanical coupled force and <b>the</b> rotor <b>torque</b> for <b>the</b> drive are given {{by means of}} electromagnetic theory and mechanical principle. The influenced factors of <b>the</b> rotor <b>torque</b> are analysed and their influences are obtained.

40|$|Dynamics of {{synchronization}} of {{rotational motion}} of contacting triple-body system is studied. It {{is assumed that}} all bodies of the system can rotate completely {{independently of one another}} and perform rotational motion about the same axis under the action of external and internal loads. The direct dynamics synchronization problem for the contacting triple-body system is stated and the algorithm of the solution of the problem is presented. To determine the synchronization time the transcendental equation is derived. <b>The</b> <b>torques</b> between contacting interfaces are determined by solving two integral equations. Finally, by knowing synchronization time and <b>the</b> <b>torques</b> between contacting interfaces, the rotational motion of the system during synchronization process is determined by integration of the governing equations with prescribed initial conditions. It was shown that the solution of the direct dynamics problem is not unique and <b>the</b> synchronizing <b>torques</b> can be subject to optimization. The obtained results are applied for a generic synchronizer mechanism of manual transmission systems. Assuming that <b>the</b> drag <b>torque,</b> <b>the</b> vehicle resistance <b>torque,</b> <b>the</b> control <b>torque</b> applied to <b>the</b> selector sleeve, and <b>the</b> synchronizing <b>torques</b> at <b>the</b> contacting interfaces are substantially constant during synchronization the solution of the direct dynamics synchronization problem for a generic synchronizer is obtained in analytical form.

5|$|The C5 {{is powered}} by a 12-volt {{lead-acid}} electric battery driving a motor with a continuous rating of 250 watts and a maximum speed of 4,100 revolutions per minute. It is coupled with a two-stage gear-drive that increases torque by a factor of 13, without which the motor {{would not be able to}} move the vehicle when a person is on board. However, the motor is vulnerable to overheating. <b>The</b> <b>torque</b> increases as the load on the vehicle increases, for instance by going up too steep a gradient. Sinclair's tests showed that it could cope under power with a maximum slope of 1 in 12 (8%) and could manage a 1 in 7 (14%) slope using the pedals. As the speed of the motor reduces, the current flow through its windings increases, drawing up to 140 amps at stall speed. This would very quickly burn the motor out if sustained, so the motor's load is constantly monitored by the C5's electronics. If it stalls under full load the electronics disable the motor after 4 seconds, while if it is under heavy load (around 80 or 90 amps) it trips after two or three minutes. A heat-sensitive resistor inside the motor warns the driver if the vehicle is beginning to overheat and disconnects the motor after a short time, and a third line of defence is provided by a metallic strip mounted on the motor. If an excessive temperature is reached the strip distorts and the power is disconnected.|$|E
25|$|The preload {{achieved}} by torquing a bolt {{is caused by}} the part of <b>the</b> <b>torque</b> that is effective. Friction in the threads and under the nut or bolt head use up some fraction of the applied torque. Much of <b>the</b> <b>torque</b> applied is lost overcoming friction under the torqued bolt head or nut (50%) and in the threads (40%). The remaining 10% of the applied torque does useful work in stretching the bolt and providing the preload. Initially, as <b>the</b> <b>torque</b> is applied, it must overcome static friction under the head of the bolt or nut (depending on which end is being torqued) and also in the threads. Finally, dynamic friction prevails and <b>the</b> <b>torque</b> is distributed in a 50/40/10 % manner as the bolt is tensioned. <b>The</b> <b>torque</b> value is dependent on the friction produced in the threads and under the torqued bolt head or nut and the fastened material or washer if used. This friction can be affected by the application of a lubricant or any plating (e.g. cadmium or zinc) applied to the threads, and the fastener's standard defines whether <b>the</b> <b>torque</b> value is for dry or lubricated threading, as lubrication can reduce <b>the</b> <b>torque</b> value by 15% to 25%; lubricating a fastener designed to be torqued dry could over-tighten it, which may damage threading or stretch the fastener beyond its elastic limit, thereby reducing its clamping ability.|$|E

25|$|Motor speed can {{be changed}} because <b>the</b> <b>torque</b> curve of the motor is {{effectively}} modified {{by the amount of}} resistance connected to the rotor circuit.
