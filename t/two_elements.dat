40|$|A linear {{strength}} vortex panel {{method was}} developed to predict the Cp and Cl for a lifting <b>two</b> <b>element</b> airfoil. The linear strength vortex panel method was first validated against thin airfoil theory and experimental data for a single NACA 2412 airfoil. At 2 degrees angle of attack, the linear strength vortex panel method predicted a Cl of about 0. 49. Experimental data and thin airfoil theory gave Cl estimations of 0. 45 and 0. 22 respectively. The Matlab code was then modified to accept a <b>two</b> <b>element</b> airfoil. The <b>two</b> key modifications were {{the separation of the}} two different sets of wing element panels and the subsequent addition of a second Kutta condition. The linear strength vortex panel method was then used to determine the Cl and Cp distribution of a <b>two</b> <b>element</b> wing. The <b>two</b> <b>element</b> wing of study was the rear wing airfoil used on the 2008 Formula SAE car. Using a reference length of 1. 43 and an angle of attack of 2 degrees, the panel method predicted a Cl of 3. 98. Improved results can be obtained by using more panels or better geometry resolution around the leading edge and the gap between the <b>two</b> wing <b>elements...</b>|$|R

In this paper, {{the effects of}} a two-dimensional electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) Structures on the performance of microstrip patch antenna arrays are investigated using the Ansoft High Frequency Selective Simulator (HFSS TM). A mushroom-like EBG structure is compared with 2 -DEBG Structures.

Therefore, diverse forms of 2 -DEBG Structures like: little number of holes, large number of holes, defect mode and different number of mushroom-patches columns structure are discussed. The <b>two</b> <b>element</b> microstrip patch antennas array placed on a defect in the electromagnetic (EBG) substrate that localizes the energy under the antennas. The excitation frequency of the <b>two</b> <b>element</b> microstrip patch antennas array near the resonance frequency of the defect mode can be used to control the coupling between antennas that are placed in an array. The mutual coupling improved by using large number of mushroom-patches columns structure. 1...|$|R
