40|$|This article {{presents}} a hybrid swarm intelligence of artificial immune system <b>tuned</b> <b>with</b> Taguchi–genetic algorithm and its {{field-programmable gate array}} realization to optimal inverse kinematics for a 5 -degree-of-freedom industrial robotic manipulator using system-on-a-programmable-chip technology. This hybridization strategy with a Taguchi–genetic algorithm parameter tuner improves the performance in conventional artificial immune system paradigms. The field-programmable gate array realization of the proposed artificial immune system <b>tuned</b> <b>with</b> Taguchi–genetic algorithm is more effective in practice for real-world embedded applications. This system-on-a-programmable-chip–based artificial immune system <b>tuned</b> <b>with</b> Taguchi–genetic algorithm is then applied to the optimal inverse kinematics redundancy solver of a 5 -degree-of-freedom robotic manipulator. The optimal joint configuration is obtained by minimizing the pre-defined affinity function in artificial immune system <b>tuned</b> <b>with</b> Taguchi–genetic algorithm for real-world embedded robotics application. The experimental results and comparative works are presented to show the effectiveness and merit of the proposed system-on-a-programmable-chip–based artificial immune system <b>tuned</b> <b>with</b> Taguchi–genetic algorithm intelligent inverse kinematics redundancy solver for a 5 -degree-of-freedom industrial robotic manipulator. This system-on-a-programmable-chip–based artificial immune system <b>tuned</b> <b>with</b> Taguchi–genetic algorithm solver outperforms the conventional solvers, such as geometric solvers, Jacobian-based solvers, hybrid genetic algorithm solvers, and particle swarm optimization solvers...|$|R

5|$|The goal of tuning a {{pipe organ}} is {{to adjust the}} pitch of each pipe so that they all sound in <b>tune</b> <b>with</b> each other. How the pitch of each pipe is {{adjusted}} depends on the type and construction of that pipe.|$|E
5|$|The {{harmonium}} {{was out of}} <b>tune</b> <b>with</b> everything. It wasn't even in <b>tune</b> <b>with</b> itself. She {{insisted on}} playing it on everything {{so we had to}} figure out ways to separate her voice from it as much as possible and then find instrumental voices that would be compatible with the harmonium track... As an arranger you're usually trying to take the songs and put a structure on them, but what I thought was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich Hertz (1887) {{experimentally}} {{demonstrated the}} resonance phenomena by building two resonant circuits, {{one of which}} was driven by a generator and the other was tunable and only coupled to the first electromagnetically (i.e., no circuit connection). Hertz showed that the response of the second circuit was at a maximum when it was in <b>tune</b> <b>with</b> the first. The diagrams produced by Hertz in this paper were the first published plots of an electrical resonant response.|$|E

Eleven-year-old journalist Smrithika Thuhina's father was an {{associate director of the}} film, and Prasad emailed him the rhyme's <b>tune</b> <b>with</b> several stills from the scene; his daughter wrote the lyrics for the rhyme.

5|$|A {{significant}} {{step in the}} process of acceptance back into the Olympic Movement was achieved at a ceremony held in Cardiff in November 1994, when the IRB was officially confirmed as a Recognised International Federation of the IOC. At that ceremony, International Olympic Committee President, Juan Antonio Samaranch, pointed out that rugby's history and values were very much in <b>tune</b> <b>with</b> the Olympic philosophy and traditions. This historic meeting in Cardiff led to IRB representation at annual IOC meetings and consideration for inclusion in the programme of future Olympic Games. In 2002, a plan was presented to induct rugby sevens, golf and the Chinese martial art of wushu.|$|E
5|$|Broccoli had {{originally}} hired Richard Maibaum {{and his friend}} Wolf Mankowitz to write Dr. Nos screenplay, partly because of Mankowitz's help in brokering the deal between Broccoli and Saltzman. An initial draft of the screenplay was rejected because the scriptwriters had made the villain, Dr. No, a monkey. Mankowitz left the movie, and Maibaum then undertook a second version, more closely {{in line with the}} novel. Mankowitz eventually had his name removed from the credits after viewing early rushes, as he feared it would be a disaster. Johanna Harwood and thriller writer Berkely Mather then worked on Maibaum's script. Terence Young described Harwood as a script doctor who helped put elements more in <b>tune</b> <b>with</b> a British character. Harwood stated in an interview in a Cinema Retro special on the making of the film that she had been a screenwriter of several of Harry Saltzman's projects; and claimed both her screenplays for Dr. No and her screenplay for From Russia with Love had followed Fleming's novels closely.|$|E

5|$|I {{realize that}} many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written, {{sometimes}} in rhapsodical strains, about {{the duty of}} this Court to keep the Constitution in <b>tune</b> <b>with</b> the times. The {{idea is that the}} Constitution must be changed from time to time, and that this Court is charged with a duty to make those changes. For myself, I must, with all deference, reject that philosophy. The Constitution makers knew the need for change, and provided for it. Amendments suggested by the people's elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their selected agents for ratification. That method of change was good for our Fathers, and, being somewhat old-fashioned, I must add it is good enough for me.|$|E
5|$|In Journey, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} a robed figure in a desert. After an {{introductory}} sequence, the player is shown the robed figure sitting in the sand, with a large mountain in the distance. The path towards this mountain, the ultimate destination of the game, is subdivided into several sections traveled through linearly. The player can walk in the levels, as well as control the camera, which typically follows behind the figure, either with the analog stick or by tilting the motion-sensitive controller. The player can jump with one button, or emit a wordless shout or musical note with another; the length and volume of the shout depends on how the button is pressed, and the note stays in <b>tune</b> <b>with</b> the background music. These controls are presented pictorially {{in the beginning of the}} game; at no point outside of the credits and title screen are any words shown or spoken.|$|E
5|$|No.77 Squadron's tasking was {{controlled}} by the United States Fifth Air Force from the time it commenced operations in Korea, and this arrangement was not affected by the formation of No.91 Wing. It moved forward from Pohang to Yonpo, near Hamhung, in November 1950, continuing its support of UN forces as they advanced up the peninsula. North Korea's counter-attack, augmented by Chinese forces, led to the squadron being hurriedly withdrawn to Pusan on 3December. Poor radio communications with No.91 Wing dogged the evacuation from Yonpo, which was effected through US Air Force support supplementing the efforts of RAAF Dakotas. Cresswell believed that the Iwakuni-based wing headquarters was not always in <b>tune</b> <b>with</b> frontline requirements, and he often dealt directly with Lieutenant General Sir Horace Robertson, BCOF commander and the theatre's senior Australian officer, and the RAAF's Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Frederick Scherger.|$|E

5|$|The PSP remake's {{localization}} {{was similar}} to those done for Persona 3 and 4, with the dialogue being in <b>tune</b> <b>with</b> modern youth and keeping {{as close to the}} original dialogue as possible except for Japan-specific cultural references. To provide a reference for their work, the localization team played through the original version of Persona. The changes made to character names and appearances were all changed back to how they appeared in the original Japanese release, {{with the exception of a}} couple of lines that had become fan favorites. These were included as a kind of homage to both players and the company's history of game localization. The entire Snow Queen quest was also reinstated.|$|E
5|$|The Social Democrat Hunchakian Party at {{one point}} had agreed to join as well, seeing that the ARF's {{political}} ideology was socialism. However, the Hunchakians claimed the new party was not Marxist enough and withdrew from the union. The original aim of the ARF was to gain autonomy for the Armenian-populated areas in the Ottoman Empire. The party began to organize itself in the Ottoman Empire in the early 1890s and held its first major meeting in Tiflis, Russian Empire, in 1892. At that meeting, the party adopted a decentralized modus operandi according to which the chapters in different countries were allowed to plan and implement policies in <b>tune</b> <b>with</b> their local political atmosphere. The party set its goal of a society based on the democratic principles of freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, freedom of religion and agrarian reform.|$|E

5|$|The Corpus Juris Civilis {{remained}} {{the basis of}} Byzantine law until {{the publication of the}} Ecloga legum in 741 by Emperor Leo III and his son and co-regent Constantine V. The Ecloga was a shortened and more philanthropic version of the Codex of Justinian, whose dispositions were more in <b>tune</b> <b>with</b> Christian values. It was written in Greek, since Latin had fallen into disuse, and its provisions continued to be applied in later centuries in the neighboring Balkan and Asia Minor regions, with surviving translations in Slavic, Armenian and Arabic. Emperor Basil I, who ruled in the 9th century, issued the Prochiron and the Epanagoge, which were legal compilations invalidating parts of the Ecloga and restoring the Justinian laws. The Prochiron served {{as the basis for the}} legal writings of the 12th-century first archbishop of Serbia, Saint Sava. His legal compilation was intended for the Serbian church but the influential work was adopted as the basic constitution for the Bulgarian and Russian orthodox churches. Around 900, Emperor Leo VI commissioned the Basilica, a Greek rewriting of the Justinian laws that is considered the ancestor of modern Greece's law until the enactment of the Code of 1940.|$|E
5|$|In the 1973 state election, the LM largely ran a {{separate}} campaign from the LCL as a whole. The {{majority of the}} LCL's metropolitan candidates were also within the LM, and {{it was hoped that}} enough seats would be gained so that not only would the LCL return to power, but that the LM would be able to overpower the conservative faction in the House of Assembly and re-elect Hall as leader. To do this, they needed to capture at least three marginal Labor seats in Adelaide. This also meant the conservatives in the LCL would be better off losing to Labor if they wanted to maintain their hold on the party, as Labor's vulnerable seats were in all in the city, and a Labor loss meant a LM gain. The LCL campaign chairperson explicitly said that she would prefer losing if it meant keeping control of the party. While the LM ran an innovative campaign, the LCL itself faltered, losing support in the country to {{a separate}} Country Party and to Labor in metropolitan Adelaide. One LM seat held by a rural member was lost to the Country Party. The LM were branded by the LCL conservatives as being the reason behind the LCL's defeat. The LM saw itself as a more modern and appropriate alternative to the LCL, more in <b>tune</b> <b>with</b> urban mainstream, but {{there was no evidence that}} urban LM candidates were more popular than conservative LCL candidates in Adelaide. LM members made up the majority of urban LCL candidates, but were unable to wrest any Labor seats in Adelaide.|$|E
