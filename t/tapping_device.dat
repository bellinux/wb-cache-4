40|$|Abstract—We {{tested the}} {{repeatability}} of a finger <b>tapping</b> <b>device</b> with magnetic sensors {{to determine its}} reliability. This device, which was developed {{to assist in the}} diagnosis of movement disorders such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) and strokes, was used to measure the distance between the thumb and index fingers during finger tapping movements (repeatedly opening and closing the gap between the thumb and forefinger). We evaluated three types of repeatability based on the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and analysis of variance (ANOVA), i. e., repeatability when movements were measured at different times, that when movements were measured with different devices, and that when movements were measured by different measurers. We analyzed these three types for three finger tapping tasks on both hands for 21 characteristics calculated from finger tapping waveforms. As a result, repeatability when using different devices was high regardless of the task or which hand was used. Repeatability when movements were measured at different times and when different measurers were used was high in some tasks, but not all. One of the finger tapping tasks (finger tapping movement with the largest amplitude and highest velocity), which is used in a conventional method of diagnosing PD (UPDRS), did not have sufficient repeatability, while the other tasks exhibited high repeatability. These results clearly demonstrate that this device is extremely reliable. I...|$|E

40|$|The {{processing}} of auditory stimuli {{is essential for}} the correct perception of language and deficits in this ability are often related to the presence or development of language disorders. The motor imitation (e. g. tapping or beating) of rhythmic sequences can be a very sensitive correlate of deficits in auditory processing. Thus, the study of the tapping performance, with the investigation of both temporal and intensity information, might be very useful. The present work is aimed at the development and preliminary testing of a <b>tapping</b> <b>device</b> to be used for the imitation and/or the production of rhythmic sequences, allowing the recording of both tapping duration and intensity. The device is essentially made up of a Force Sensing Resistor and an Arduino UNO board.

40|$|One of the {{treatment}} options for prostate cancer is brachytherapy with iodine- 125 sources. In prostate brachytherapy a high radiation dose is delivered to the prostate with a steep dose fall off to critical surrounding organs. The implantation of the iodine sources is currently performed under ultrasound guidance, but MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) offers a better image quality that could be employed to further improve source placement precision and prostate dose distribution. Due to the limited amount of space inside a closed bore MRI scanner the currently used manual implantation technique is impossible. Therefore a robotic device, which can be placed between the patient’s legs, is being developed. Prostate motion {{is one of the}} main causes of seed misplacement. Because this motion is more or less random there is no practical solution to take it into account during planning of {{the treatment}} (chapter 2). To diminish prostate motion a new needle insertion method was developed. Instead of pushing the needle into the prostate, the needle is tapped into the prostate with a high velocity. A <b>tapping</b> <b>device</b> was built and tested on a piece a beef (chapter 3). The tests showed less beef motion with higher needle insertion velocities. After the phantom experiments a clinical study was performed to compare prostate motion during needle insertion for pushing and tapping the needle into the prostate (chapter 4). The mean prostate motion was 5. 6 ~mm when the needle was pushed and 0. 9 mm when the needle was tapped into the prostate. We expect that prostate movement will be further reduced when the <b>tapping</b> <b>device</b> is operated at higher momentums. To be able to deliver the iodine seeds at the pre-planned position a good image of the prostate, the needle and the seeds is necessary. The only currently available commercial MRI compatible needles are made of titanium, which still gives a rather large artefact at the tip. This makes it difficult to determine the exact position of the delivered seeds (dimensions 4. 5 x 0. 8 mm), which is of importance for accurate dose delivery in the prostate. In chapter 5 a simulation study was performed to investigate the influence of different needle materials on the seed artefact. Only with a plastic needle it was possible to distinguish the seed artefact. When the middle of the seed position is taken as the middle of the seed artefact, the seed position can be determined with an accuracy of 0. 4 mm on Gradient Echo images. In chapter 6 the first prototype of the MRI compatible robotic device is described. MRI compatibility tests proved the working of the robotic device in a magnetic field without distorting the MR images. In the near future pre-clinical experiments will be performed to test the functionality and the needle and seed placement accuracy of the robotic device. Thanks to the new needle insertion method and the MRI-guidance we think that more accurate seed placement and therefore a better dose distribution is possible than currently achieved...|$|E

Approach: This research investigated possible fast NDT systems and algorithms and provides a novel approach that allows engineers and researchers to pinpoint defects in real time. The system was based on incident signals on a composite surface being detected and analyzed. Any damage in the composite causes a change in the detected signal.

Metal trances {{are limited in}} density-speed performance due to the skin effect, electrical conductivity, and cross talk.

As more and more optical lightwave circuits and intra-chip optical interconnects are fabricated, a compact, low loss optical tapping {{technology is}} essential to incorporate optical interconnects into mainstream CMOS processes. In this thesis, a new optical <b>tapping</b> <b>device,</b> which is based on optical refractive index variation induced by ion-implantation, was studied for both applications of intra-chip optical interconnect and optical power monitoring for planar lightwave circuits. Beam propagation simulation was used to study the guided waveguide properties of ion-implanted optical taps. The length and tapping ratio of optical tap was optimized as functions of implanted ion energy and concentration for 1550 nm guided light. The behavior of ion-implanted optical taps can be explained by waveguide coupling between ion-implanted waveguides and as-fabricated waveguides. Ion implantation experiments have also been performed on silica-on-silicon planar lightwave circuit devices using hydrogen ions. Ion concentration up to 5 × 1016 ion/cm 3 were used in experiments with implantation energy from 1. 2 MeV to 1. 35 MeV. Transmission experimental results are qualitatively consistent with the simulation results.

40|$|The Iowa Department of Transportation is {{responsible}} for maintaining approximately 3800 bridges throughout the State. Of these bridges approximately 3200 have concrete decks. The remaining bridges have been constructed or repaired with a Portland Cement (P. C.) concrete overlay. Surveys of the overlays have indicated a growing incidence of delaminations and surface distress. The need to replace or repair the overlay may be dictated {{by the amount of}} delamination in the deck. Additionally, the concrete bridges are periodically inspected and scheduled for the appropriate rehabilitation. Part of this analysis is an assessment of the amount of delamination present in the deck. The ability to accurately and economically identify delamination in overlays and bridge decks is necessary to cost-effectively evaluate and schedule bridge rehabilitation. There are two conventional methods currently being used to detect delaminations. One is ref erred to as a chain drag method. The other a electro-mechanical sounding method (delamtect). In the chain drag method, the concrete surface is struck using a heavy chain. The inspector then listens to the sound produced as the surface is struck. The delaminated areas produce a dull sound as compared to nondelaminated areas. This procedure has proved to be very time consuming, especially when a number of small areas of delamination are present. With the · electro-mechanical method, the judgement of the inspector has been eliminated. A· device with three basic components, a <b>tapping</b> <b>device,</b> a sonic receiver, and a system of signal interpretation has been developed. This· device is wheeled along the deck and the instrument receives and interprets the acoustic signals generated by the instrument which in turn are reflected through the concrete. A recently developed method of detecting delaminations is infrared thermography. This method of detection is based on the difference in surface temperature which exists between delaminated and nondelaminated concrete under certain atmospheric conditions. The temperature difference can reach 5 °C on a very sunny day where dry pavement exists. If clouds are present, or the pavement is wet, then the temperature difference between the delaminated and nondelaminated concrete will not be as great and therefore more difficult to detect. Infrared thermography was used to detect delaminations in 17 concrete bridge decks, 2 P. C. concrete overlays, and 1 section of continuously reinforced concrete pavement (CRCP) in Iowa. Thermography was selected to assess the accuracy, dependability, and potential of the infrared thermographic technique...|$|E
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{is applied to}} non-invasively visualize patient’s anatomy and tumour suspicious regions with superior soft tissue contrast. Amongst others, online MRI is valuable in the diagnostic and treatment techniques for prostate cancer. Clinical MR scanners are suitable to perform MRI-guided needle interventions, such as biopsies and brachytherapy, but the access to the patient in the narrow MR bore is limited. Therefore, robotic devices have to be developed to execute these diagnostic and treatment techniques. This thesis describes the development and quality assurance of the University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU) robot. Furthermore, it reports the first in vivo experiences with this robot and discusses its possible future applications. Chapter 1 is a general introduction to this research. In Chapter 2, the results are presented of a feasibility study on the dose coverage in low-dose rate brachytherapy using divergent needle insertion methods, as could theoretically be established inside the MR scanner applying the UMCU robot. The study revealed that with the divergent needle methods adequate dose distributions in the prostate can be achieved. Chapter 3 describes a new method to detect undesired situations with risk of tissue heating around the needle tip caused by the radiofrequency (RF) waves needed to generate MR images during interventional procedures. The method {{is based on the}} RF induced image artefacts and quantifies the induced current inside the needle. The method is effective for detecting potentially dangerous situations non-invasively. In Chapter 4, development considerations and quality assurance methods of MRI-guided robotic devices dedicated for needle interventions are listed. It provides background information {{on how to deal with}} the MRI-related challenges, such as accessibility, MR compatibility, needle placement accuracy and safety, before the devices can be safely applied on patients. Chapter 5 reports the proof of principle of our robot. Four fiducial gold markers were placed under MRI guidance inside the prostate of a prostate cancer patient using the UMCU robot. The needle could automatically be inserted and tracked using fast MR scans. Despite an advanced needle insertion technique (tapping), prostate deformations up to 7 mm were measured, which implies that improvement of the <b>tapping</b> <b>device</b> for further reduction of tissue deformation is needed. In Chapter 6, it is investigated whether single shot MR tagging can be used to quantify local prostate deformations due to the needle insertion. Single shot MR tagging creates artificial landmarks in the prostate which deform with the actual tissue deformations. The method can for example be used to better position the needle during the intervention or to assure the needle insertion quality of robotic devices. Chapter 7 summarizes the various studies of this thesis and discusses the future applications of the UMCU robot, such as online MRI-guided prostate brachytherapy and biopsies. To our knowledge, the UMCU robot is the first and up-to-now the only robotic device in the world that performed a needle insertion in patients inside an MR scanner, while tracking the needle using online MRI...|$|E
