5|$|According to {{journalist}} Rick Perlstein, in June, 1972, Daley led a mob {{on behalf}} of his father's Democratic Party regulars against pro-McGovern reformers meeting in a church in Illinois' Fifth Congressional District. <b>The</b> <b>action</b> <b>was</b> unsuccessful and the reformers' slate (which included Rev. Jesse Jackson) replaced the Daley slate at the Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida.|$|E
5|$|As al-Mansur's {{persecution}} intensified, pressure {{began to}} mount on the brothers to react. Kufa, the traditional Alid base, was kept under close surveillance by the Abbasid government, {{and the two}} brothers resolved to launch a simultaneous rebellion in Basra and Medina. Although the Alids could count on a large network of sympathizers throughout the Caliphate, <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>was</b> rushed and lacked organization.|$|E
5|$|Gunboat {{diplomacy}} {{was typically}} conducted by cruisers or smaller warships. A British squadron of three protected cruisers and two gunboats {{brought about the}} capitulation of Zanzibar in 1896; and while battleships participated in the combined fleet Western powers deployed during the Boxer rebellion, the naval part of <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>was</b> performed by gunboats, destroyers and sloops.|$|E
50|$|Imperative: The {{imperative}} mode {{is marked}} by several different morphemes, depending on how <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> {{to be carried out}}. /pi/ <b>is</b> used when <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> to be carried out {{in the presence of the}} speaker, as in cenopi Look!. /pada/ <b>is</b> used when <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> to be completed in the absence of the speaker.|$|R
5000|$|At its simplest, a rule <b>is</b> a {{conditional}} <b>action.</b> <b>The</b> <b>action</b> can <b>be</b> anything {{appropriate to}} the domain. For augmenting web pages, <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> page modifiers. In other domains, <b>the</b> <b>action</b> can <b>be</b> whatever <b>the</b> endpoint can consume. When a rule's <b>action</b> <b>is</b> taken, we say that the rule [...] "fired." [...] Note that <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> conditional: <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> taken only when the rule is selected and its premise is true.|$|R
50|$|A party's {{citizenship}} at {{the time}} of the filing of <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> considered <b>the</b> citizenship of the party. If a defendant later moves to the same state as the plaintiff while <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> pending, <b>the</b> federal court will still have jurisdiction. However, if any defendant is a citizen of the state where <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> first filed, diversity does not exist. 28 U.S.C. §1441(b).|$|R
5|$|On {{this day}} the Luftwaffe {{embarked}} on an all-out attack against London. Around 1,500 aircraft {{took part in the}} air battles which lasted until dusk. <b>The</b> <b>action</b> <b>was</b> the climax of the Battle of Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{attorneys}} {{who represented the}} LaRouche entities in the bankruptcy trial filed a brief stating that <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>was</b> unprecedented and improper, alleging that it deviated from the standard rules of involuntary bankruptcy, and {{that members of the}} Alexandria prosecution team from the second criminal trial were involved in the planning and execution of the bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} the raid was disputed. Collier claimed <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>was</b> {{successful}} in destroying military stores for an attack on Fort Cumberland (although such stores had not been delivered to Machias), while the defenders claimed that they had successfully prevented the capture of Machias and driven off the British.|$|E
3000|$|...]i= 1,…,N. If <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> to be {{performed}} during a stop, then the entry’s position {{is identical to the}} previous one. If <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> triggered by position, the time duration is zero.|$|R
5000|$|The suffix [...] {{indicates}} <b>the</b> <b>action</b> had <b>been</b> stopped, {{but is now}} resuming, or that <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> {{being performed}} again.|$|R
2500|$|This can be {{analyzed}} as follows; note that for 2 and 3 <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> not faithful (it is a non-trivial quotient, and the PSL group is not simple), while for 5, 7, and 11 <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> faithful (as <b>the</b> group <b>is</b> simple and <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> non-trivial), and yields an embedding into Sp. In all but the last case, PSL(2, 11), it corresponds to an exceptional isomorphism, where the right-most group has an obvious action on p points: ...|$|R
5|$|For the French, {{despite their}} success earlier at Frauenfeld, <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>was</b> {{considerably}} less successful. In the clash, Ney was sufficiently wounded {{that he took}} immediate leave, and remained out of action and command until 22 July. The conduct of the battle also demonstrated {{the weakness of the}} French command system in which personal animosity and competition between high-ranking officers, in this case, Soult and Tharreau, undermined French military objectives. Tharreau eventually charged Soult with insubordination; Soult had outright refused to go to Ney's assistance, despite specific, and direct, orders to move his division to Ney's flanks.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Burnet {{decided that}} {{research}} at the Institute should focus on immunology. Burnet reached the decision unilaterally, leaving many of the research staff disillusioned and feeling <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>was</b> arrogant; for Burnet's part he was comfortable with the decision as he thought it to be effective. Many virologists left the Institute and settled the Australian National University's John Curtin School of Medical Research. After 1957 all new staff and students at the Institute worked on immunological problems; Burnet was involved in work relating to autoimmune diseases and the graft-versus-host reaction, and increasingly in theoretical studies of immunology, immunological surveillance and cancer.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, almost 200 former cleanup workers took {{legal action}} against the United States. <b>The</b> <b>action</b> <b>was</b> unsuccessful, but {{resulted}} in the release of hundreds of classified documents. The documents revealed that USAF personnel involved in the clean-up were not subsequently monitored for health problems, despite the likelihood of greater exposure to radiation than the Danes. The United States has since instigated regular examinations of its workers. In 1995, the Danish government paid 1,700 workers compensation of 50,000kroner each.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> Mauser-style with controlled-feed {{and come}} in both left and {{right-handed}} variations {{in a number of}} different sizes to fit different cartridges. They are similar to Winchester Model 70 actions but with more safety features. <b>The</b> <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> noted for being extremely strong.|$|R
2500|$|Several {{different}} {{definitions of}} [...] "the action" [...] are in common use in physics. <b>The</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> usually an integral over time. However, when <b>the</b> <b>action</b> pertains to fields, {{it may be}} integrated over spatial variables as well. In some cases, <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> integrated along <b>the</b> path followed by the physical system.|$|R

5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the game}} was shown live on ITV's The Match, which aired a live Division One game most {{weeks of the season}} from 1988 to 1992. Elton Welsby {{presented}} coverage and his guest was the England coach Bobby Robson. The match commentator on the night was Brian Moore, alongside former Tottenham Hotspur manager David Pleat. On radio, <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>was</b> summarised by Peter Jones on BBC Radio 2.|$|E
5|$|John Bellinger III, {{who served}} as the U.S. State Department's senior lawyer during President George W. Bush's second term, said the strike was a {{legitimate}} military action and did not run counter to the U.S.' self-imposed prohibition on assassinations:The killing is not prohibited by the long-standing assassination prohibition in executive order 12333 , because <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>was</b> a military action in the ongoing U.S. armed conflict with al-Qaeda, and it is not prohibited to kill specific leaders of an opposing force. The assassination prohibition does not apply to killings in self-defense.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Jennings was {{the first}} Governor to have an {{attempted}} impeachment brought against him {{in response to his}} actions as an agent of the federal government during the negotiations of the Treaty of St. Mary's in 1819, illegal under Indiana's constitution. The evidence of his role was destroyed, and after two months of investigation the proceedings were dropped. The only other time was when the General Assembly attempted to bring impeachment proceedings against Governor James B. Ray for a similar action in 1826, but <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>was</b> also defeated 28–30.|$|E
50|$|The Vanuatu {{language}} Lenakel has {{not only}} a venitive suffix, but also a suffix that indicates that <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> directed towards <b>the</b> person addressed, {{as well as a}} neutral suffix that indicates that <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> directed neither towards the speaker nor towards the person addressed.|$|R
50|$|Knowledge of results, or {{sometimes}} immediate knowledge of results, {{can be used}} for any learning where a student (or an animal) gets information after <b>the</b> <b>action.</b> <b>The</b> information <b>is</b> about how satisfactory <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is.</b>|$|R

5|$|On 10 November 2005, Paulus won {{an unjust}} {{detention}} {{action against the}} Aruban government, clearing him as a suspect and allowing him to retain his government contract. The elder Van der Sloot then brought a second action, seeking monetary damages {{for himself and his}} family because of his false arrest. <b>The</b> <b>action</b> <b>was</b> initially successful, but the award of 40,000 Aruban florins (US$22,300) was reversed on appeal. The family's finances were depleted by the legal expenses. In January 2007, Paulus found work as a managing partner at the law firm that represented him.|$|E
5|$|On 4 October 1918, the 24th Battalion {{took part}} in the attack that {{captured}} the Beaurevoir sector in France, and was, therefore, expecting to have a rest the following day when the unit was unexpectedly ordered to take part in another attack. The assault was to commence at 06:05 from the village of Remicourt, and lead to the capture of Montbrehain by the 21st and 24th Battalions with tanks to provide support. <b>The</b> <b>action</b> <b>was</b> to prove the final engagement for the Australian infantry during the war, and it was during this attack that Ingram was to earn the Victoria Cross; the sixty-fourth, and final, Australian to do so during the First World War.|$|E

2500|$|The {{notion of}} group <b>action</b> can <b>be</b> {{put in a}} broader context by using <b>the</b> <b>action</b> groupoid [...] {{associated}} to <b>the</b> group <b>action,</b> thus allowing techniques from groupoid theory such as presentations and fibrations. Further the stabilizers of <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> vertex groups, [...] and the orbits of <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> components, of <b>the</b> <b>action</b> groupoid. For more details, see the book Topology and groupoids referenced below.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{action for}} eleven-dimensional {{standard}} supergravity genuinely invariant under the D'Auria–Fré group is proposed. The construction of <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> carried {{out through a}} generalization of the Stelle–West–Grignani–Nardelli formalism. <b>The</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> genuinely invariant under this group without the need to impose auxiliary conditions such as a torsion-free condition...|$|R
5000|$|Perfective aspect (traditionally {{also called}} aorist aspect in Greek grammar): {{indicating}} that <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> started and concluded {{at the same}} time, or that <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> focused on a single point in time, or that <b>the</b> <b>action</b> simply occurs without reference to its duration or lasting effect. The aorist conveys this aspect in all moods.|$|R
5|$|Ten were honoured {{for their}} role in the operation, seven {{receiving}} Distinguished Service Medals, two the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal and one, the grievously wounded Ritchie, the Victoria Cross. Ritchie had not initially been recommended for this award; the recommendation being submitted at a later date by an unidentified figure in the Admiralty. Snelling speculates that the Admiralty's change of heart was possibly a morale boosting measure, although Ritchie's courage during <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>was</b> never called into question. The shrapnel and bullet wounds he sustained in the raid were extensive, including injuries to his forehead, left thumb, left arm (twice), right arm, right hip and a badly broken right leg after being hit by two large calibre machine gun bullets.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 22 January 1809 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{fought off}} the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe during the Napoleonic Wars. <b>The</b> <b>action</b> <b>was</b> fought {{as part of the}} blockade of Guadeloupe and neighbouring Martinique by a large British Royal Navy squadron, which was seeking to cut the islands off from contact and supplies from France by preventing the passage of shipping from Europe to the islands. The British blockade was part of their preparation for planned invasions during the next year.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 29 November 1811 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} fought {{between two}} frigate squadrons in the Adriatic Sea during the Adriatic campaign of the Napoleonic Wars. <b>The</b> <b>action</b> <b>was</b> {{one of a series}} of operations conducted by the British Royal Navy and the French Navy to contest dominance over the Adriatic between 1807 and 1814. During this period the Adriatic was surrounded by French territory or French client states and as a result British interference was highly disruptive to the movement of French troops and supplies.|$|E
5000|$|The basic {{principle}} of Lagrangian mechanics, {{the principle of}} stationary <b>action,</b> <b>is</b> that an object subjected to outside influences will [...] "choose" [...] a path which makes a certain quantity, <b>the</b> <b>action,</b> an extremum. <b>The</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> a functional, a mathematical relationship which takes an entire path and produces a single number. The physical path, that which the object actually follows, is the path for which <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> [...] "stationary" [...] (or extremal): any small variation of the path from the physical one does not significantly change <b>the</b> <b>action.</b> (Often, this <b>is</b> equivalent to saying the physical path is the one for which <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> a minimum.) <b>Actions</b> <b>are</b> typically written using Lagrangians, formulas which depend upon the object's state at a particular point in space and/or time. In non-relativistic mechanics, for example, a point particle's Lagrangian {{is the difference between}} kinetic and potential energy: [...] <b>The</b> <b>action,</b> often written , <b>is</b> then the integral of this quantity from a starting time to an ending time: ...|$|R
