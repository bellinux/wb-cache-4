5|$|The name Mysore is an anglicised {{version of}} Mahishūru, {{which means the}} abode of Mahisha in <b>the</b> <b>vernacular</b> Kannada. The common noun Mahisha, in Sanskrit, means buffalo; in this context, however, Mahisha refers to Mahishasura, a mythical demon who could assume the form of both human and buffalo, who, {{according}} to Hindu mythology, ruled the ancient parts of Mysore Kingdom, known in Sanskrit as Mahíšhaka, centred at Mahishapura. He was killed by the Goddess Chamundeshwari, whose temple is situated atop the Chamundi Hills, after whom it is named. 'Mahishapura' later became Mahisūru (a name which, even now, the royal family uses), and finally came to be anglicised as Mysore by the British and Maisūru/Mysuru in <b>the</b> <b>vernacular</b> Kannada language.|$|E
40|$|The Bouyei {{language}} {{is divided into}} three <b>vernaculars,</b> <b>the</b> southern <b>vernacular,</b> <b>the</b> central <b>vernacular</b> and <b>the</b> southwestern <b>vernacular.</b> This paper aims to describe the lexicology of <b>the</b> southern <b>vernacular</b> of <b>the</b> Bouyei language focusing on word formation process. Bouyei words are formed by affixing, compounding and reduplicating. First, the affixation consists of prefixing and suffixing. Infixing is not found in this language. Second, the compound is divided into the semantic and syntactic compound. Finally, the reduplication is divided into the simple and complex reduplication. The simple reduplication is normally used to emphasize the meaning of the root or to indicate plurality...|$|R

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{especially}} due to <b>the</b> <b>vernacular</b> language used, {{this work was}} largely neglected among the Greek scholars, especially by Adamantios Korais and Dimitrios Katartzis, and was never used as an academic work, or even as a school textbook. It was also negatively received by the Church hierarchy, as well as conservative Greek scholars, due to <b>the</b> <b>vernacular</b> language it used and the liberal views it expressed. It {{is worth noting that}} the work’s linguistic form disappointed even Dimitrios Katartzis, the intellectual mentor of the two authors, while Philippidis himself, never used such vernacular style language again in his future works. However, Geographia Neoteriki inspired a number of similar geographical works published in Greece during the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|The Anglo-Saxons {{were the}} first people in {{northern}} Europe to write administrative documents in <b>the</b> <b>vernacular,</b> and law codes in Old English go back to Æthelberht of Kent {{at the beginning of}} the seventh century.

His code was strongly influenced by Carolingian law going back to Charlemagne in such areas as treason, peace-keeping, organisation of the hundreds and judicial ordeal. It remained in force throughout the tenth century, and Æthelstan's codes were built on this foundation. Legal codes required the approval of the king, but they were treated as guidelines which could be adapted and added to at local level, rather than a fixed canon of regulations, and customary oral law was also important in the Anglo-Saxon period.|$|E

5|$|All {{copies of}} Hymn {{are found in}} manuscripts of the Historia ecclesiastica or its {{translation}}, where they serve as either a gloss to Bede's Latin translation of the Old English poem, or, {{in the case of}} the Old English version, a replacement for Bede's translation in the main text of the History. Despite this close connection with Bede's work, the Hymn does not appear to have been transmitted with the Historia ecclesiastica regularly until relatively late in its textual history. Scribes other than those responsible for the main text often copy <b>the</b> <b>vernacular</b> text of the Hymn in manuscripts of the Latin Historia. In three cases, Oxford, Bodleian Library, Laud Misc. 243, Oxford, Bodleian Library, Hatton 43, and Winchester, Cathedral I, the poem is copied by scribes working a quarter-century or more after the main text was first set down. Even when the poem is in the same hand as the manuscript's main text, there is little evidence to suggest that it was copied from the same exemplar as the Latin Historia: nearly identical versions of the Old English poem are found in manuscripts belonging to different recensions of the Latin text; closely related copies of the Latin Historia sometimes contain very different versions of the Old English poem. With the exception of the Old English translation, no single recension of the Historia ecclesiastica is characterised by the presence of a particular recension of <b>the</b> <b>vernacular</b> poem.|$|E

By examining these works, I investigate how the type of learning associated with the study of Latin texts becomes an exemplum that inspires the development of <b>the</b> <b>vernacular's</b> literary capacities. A comparison of the two suggests that the former theorizes <b>the</b> <b>vernacular's</b> potential as a literary language to identify the interpretive skills that it still needs to acquire, while the latter demonstrates such an acquisition. Together, Gower and Christine demonstrate {{the rise of a}} more "learned" <b>vernacular</b> in <b>the</b> late Middle Ages, primed by skills taken from Latinate practices and ready to stake its claim on literary excellence...|$|R
5|$|As the {{tradition}} of classical Gaelic poetry declined, a new tradition of vernacular Gaelic poetry began to emerge. While Classical poetry used a language largely fixed in the twelfth century, <b>the</b> <b>vernacular</b> continued to develop. In contrast to the Classical tradition, which used syllabic metre, vernacular poets tended to use stressed metre. However, they shared with the Classic poets a set of complex metaphors and role, as the verse was still often panegyric. A number of these vernacular poets were women, such as Mary MacLeod of Harris (c. 1615–1707).|$|E
5|$|Georgy Vernadsky even {{identified}} the Oleg of the Schechter Letter with Igor's otherwise anonymous eldest son, whose widow Predslava is {{mentioned in the}} Russo-Byzantine treaty of 944.
