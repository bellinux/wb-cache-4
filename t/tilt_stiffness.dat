5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{has played}} an enormous role in refining the wings, control and sensory systems, {{and anything else}} that affects aerodynamics or kinematics. One noteworthy trait is wing twist. Most insect wings are twisted, as are helicopter blades, with a higher angle of attack at the base. The twist generally is between 10 and 20 degrees. In addition to this twist, the wing surfaces are not necessarily flat or featureless; most larger insects have wing membranes distorted and angled between the veins {{in such a way that}} the cross-section of the wings approximates an airfoil. Thus, the wing's basic shape already is capable of generating a small amount of lift at zero angle of attack. Most insects control their wings by adjusting <b>tilt,</b> <b>stiffness,</b> and flapping frequency of the wings with tiny muscles in the thorax (below). Some insects evolved other wing features that are not advantageous for flight, but play a role in something else, such as mating or protection.|$|E

The simulation data and the experimental data can be seen to agree very closely. This fully proves the reliability of the simulation model. Based on this simulation model, which has been parameterized, the influence of the axial length and inner and outer radii on the reduced <b>tilting</b> <b>stiffness</b> of rubber bush is studied by using the co-simulation of MATLAB and ANSYS...|$|R

40|$|The {{variations}} of the supporting condition, which change the <b>stiffness</b> of <b>tilting</b> pad thrust bearing, may alter the dynamic behavior of the rotor system. The effects of supporting condition of thrust pad on the lateral vibration of a hydroelectric generating set are investigated in this paper. The action of a thrust bearing is described as moments acting on the thrust collar, and the <b>tilting</b> <b>stiffness</b> coefficients of thrust bearing are calculated. A model based on typical beam finite element method is established to calculate the dynamic response, {{and the effects of}} supporting conditions such as elastic oil tank support, different heights of the thrust pads with rigid support are discussed. The results reveal that the influence of thrust bearing is small when the elastic oil tanks work normally. When the supporting conditions turn to be rigid due to the oil leakage, the differences of thrust pad heights have evident influence on the load distribution of the thrust pads; while the effects on the <b>tilting</b> <b>stiffness</b> of the thrust bearing and the amplitude of the lateral shaft vibration is small when the maximum load on thrust pads is smaller than the allowable value...|$|R

Even with a chamber depth of 1/100 mm, the dead volume is very high. In the worst cases, these air bearings consist of a [...] bearing surface instead of a chamber. Disadvantages of these air bearings include a very poor <b>tilt</b> <b>stiffness.</b>|$|E
50|$|Moving air {{bearings}} are tilting {{due to the}} {{aerodynamic effects}} within the gap. Depending on the <b>tilt</b> <b>stiffness,</b> an air bearing’s force capacity decreases with an increasing velocity until it reaches a limit at which it totally fails. Micro nozzle air bearings have a velocity limit which can reach, depending on the customization, dozens of m/s. However, for air bearings with chambers and variable canal structures, a velocity only of a few m/s is already harmful.|$|E

The flexibility effect of the reinforcement on the bonded elastic layers of a circular cross-section subjected to pure bending moment is analyzed through a theoretical approach. Based on two kinematics assumptions in the elastic layers, the closed-form solutions of the horizontal displacements in the elastic layers and the reinforcements are solved using the governing equations established by stress equilibrium in the elastic layers and the reinforcements. Through these solved displacements, the <b>tilting</b> <b>stiffness</b> of the bonded elastic layer, the shear stress on the bonding surfaces, and the internal forces of the reinforcements are derived in closed forms...|$|R
40|$|The {{classical}} {{treatment of}} circular, hydrostatic, orifice-regulated thrust gas bearings, in which perfectly plane bearing plates are assumed, is extended to include axisymmetric, but otherwise arbitrary, plate profiles.

By a suitable combination of gas inlet impedance and concave plate profile, the static stiffness can be made almost constant over a wide load range, and to remain positive at the closure load.

40|$|Soft hub {{concepts}} {{which allow}} the direct replacement of articulated rotor systems by bearingless types without {{any change in}} controllability or need for reinforcement to the drive shaft and/or transmission/fuselage attachments of the helicopter were studied. Two concepts were analyzed and confirmed for functional and structural feasibility against a design criteria and specifications established for this effort. Both systems are gimballed about a thrust carrying universal elastomeric bearing. One concept includes a set of composite flexures for drive torque transmittal from the shaft to the rotor, and another set (which is changeable) to impart hub <b>tilting</b> <b>stiffness</b> to the rotor system as required to meet the helicopter application. The second concept uses a composite bellows flexure to drive the rotor and to augment the hub stiffness provided by the elastomeric bearing.

50|$|The {{stiffness}} maximum is higher, {{and most}} importantly, this stiffness is achieved for operation-relevant (higher) air gaps. The air bearing technology solely allows {{such a high}} stiffness and distinctive maximum, even for a higher air gap, without any disadvantages.Unlike others, micro-nozzle air bearings do not face any self-excited vibrations even with a higher air pressure (more than 10 bar).With a higher <b>tilt</b> <b>stiffness,</b> the air bearings achieve a higher dynamic (acceleration, jerk, speed) and smoothness of the system.|$|E

We {{are able to}} calculate load, stiffness, <b>tilt</b> <b>stiffness,</b> and air consumption of a complete spindle guidance configuration, both at a standstill and highest rotary speed (including dynamic effects). With this method, one is able to give a prediction about the maximum rotary speed and natural frequencies. This is an indispensable requirement for a perfect spindle configuration.With this calculation technique, cylindrical air bearings stiffness and air consumption on manufacturing tolerances are optimized.|$|E

They must find their food in tight spaces and be capable of escaping larger predators - or they may themselves be predators, and need to capture prey. Their maneuverability, from an aerodynamic viewpoint, is provided by high lift and thrust forces. Typical insect fliers can attain lift forces up to three times their weight and horizontal thrust forces up to five times their weight. There are two substantially different insect flight mechanisms, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages - just because odonates have a more primitive flight mechanism does not mean they are less able fliers; they are, in certain ways, more agile than anything that has evolved afterward.|$|E
40|$|The {{aeroelastic}} {{stability of}} a circulation control rotor blade undergoing three degrees of motion (flap, lag, and torsion) is investigated in forward flight. Quasi-steady strip theory {{is used to}} evaluate the aerodynamics forces; and the airfoil characteristics are from data tables. The propulsive and the auxiliary power trims are calculated from vehicle and rotor equilibrium equations through the numerical integration of element forces in azimuth as well as in radial directions. The nonlinear time dependent periodic blade response is calculated using an iterative procedure based on Floquet theory. The periodic perturbation equations are solved for stability using Floquet transition matrix theory. The effects of several parameters on blade stability are examined, including advance ratio, collective pitch, thrust level, shaft <b>tilt,</b> structural <b>stiffnesses</b> variation, and propulsive and auxiliary power trims...|$|R
40|$|Rotordynamic {{and thermal}} {{analyses}} of compliant flexure pivot tilting pad gas bearings were performed. First, compliant flexure pivot tilting pad gas bearings with pad radial compliance (CFTPBs) were introduced and designed for high-speed oil-free micro turbomachinery. The pad radial compliance was for accommodation of large rotor growth at high speeds. Parametric studies on pivot offset, preload, and <b>tilting</b> <b>stiffness</b> were performed using non-linear orbit simulations and coast-down simulations for an optimum design. Second, coast-down tests for imbalance response {{and stability of}} typical rotor-bearing system with a rigid rotor and two CFTPBs designed from the above design studies were conducted over operating speeds up to 55 krpm. Prediction of synchronous rotordynamic responses was made in terms of critical speed for various imbalance modes by using a rotordynamic analysis software (XLTRC), combined with dynamic force coefficients from the perturbation analysis. For stability analyses, a generalized orbit simulation program was developed considering both the translational and angular rotor motions with two different bearings. Linear stability analyses for the conical vibration mode were also performed by using XLTRC and the perturbation analysis based on the Lund method. Predictions of whirl speed showed good agreement to the tests, but the estimated onset speed of instability appeared lower than the measured instability. Finally, a new thermo-hydrodynamic analysis model of a typical rotor-bearing system with CFTPBs was presented, accompanying linear perturbation analyses to investigate thermal effects on the rotordynamic performance. A numerical procedure was established for solving the generalized Reynolds equation, the 3 -D energy equation, and the associated boundary conditions at the pad inlet flow and solid walls (rotor and pad) simultaneously. Parametric studies were conducted on nominal clearance and external load. Nominal clearance showed significant influence on temperature fields, and external load had uneven thermal effects among pads. Case studies with heat flux and temperature boundary conditions on the rotor end surface were performed to simulate various working conditions of the bearing. Large rotor thermal growth due to the high rotor temperature showed noticeable influence on rotordynamic performance by increasing direct stiffness and damping coefficients...|$|R

An experimental investigation is also carried out to verify the theory, comprising a broad range of carefully performed tests. A fair agreement is obtained between the theoretical and experimental results.

40|$|SNARE trans {{complexes}} between membranes likely promote membrane fusion. For the t-SNARE syntaxin 1 A {{involved in}} synaptic transmission, the secondary structure and bending stiffness of the five-residue juxtamembrane linker {{is assumed to}} determine the required mechanical energy transfer from the cytosolic core complex to the membrane. These properties have here been studied by molecular dynamics and annealing simulations for the wild-type and a C-terminal-prolongated mutant within a neutral and an acidic bilayer, suggesting linker stiffnesses above 1. 7 but below 50 × 10 − 3 kcal mol− 1 deg− 2. The transmembrane helix {{was found to be}} tilted by 15 ° and tightly anchored within the membrane with a stiffness of 4 – 5 kcal mol− 1 Å− 2. The linker turned out to be marginally helical and strongly influenced by its lipid environment. Charged lipids increased the helicity and H 3 helix <b>tilt</b> <b>stiffness.</b> For the wild type, the linker was seen embedded deeply within the polar region of the bilayer, whereas the prolongation shifted the linker outward. This reduced its helicity and increased its average tilt, thereby presumably reducing fusion efficiency. Our results suggest that partially unstructured linkers provide considerable mechanical coupling; the energy transduced cooperatively by the linkers in a native fusion event is thus estimated to be 3 – 8 kcal/mol, implying a two-to-five orders of magnitude fusion rate increase...|$|E
40|$|The "classic" {{solution}} {{for the support of}} a translating lockgate, the wheelonrail support, has relatively high construction as well as inspection and maintenance costs. An alternative support which has previously been developed for use in the Prins WillemAlexander lock is the socalled "hydrosupport", a hydrostatic thrust bearing that slides on an elastic track and is connected to the lockgate by an elastic support. After a runningin period, this support shows low friction. In this thesis several methods to further improve this type of support have been studied. The direction of these improvements has been guided by the following observation: The typical dimensions and manufacturing standards of the bearing and the track are in conflict. On the large scale of a lockgate, a hydrostatic bearing typically requires sliding surfaces with a surface waviness smaller than 0. 1 mm/m. However, the track can not be manufactured easily with a surface waviness smaller than typically 0. 5 mm/m. This means that contact between the bearing and track will be inevitable. In this thesis, methods have been studied to use this contact in order to improve the performance (namely reduced flow rate and pumping power) of the hydrosupport. A mathematical model has been developed, incorporating the elastic deformation of the track, bearing and support, and the partial contact and hydrostatic lubricating film between the bearing and track. Several track waviness models have been developed, among others a random periodic surface waviness. Furthermore the concept of an "ideal" support has been introduced, which under compression exhibits a reaction pressure equal to the hydrostatic pressure in a lubricating film with a constant height. Not only has this mathematical model been developed in this thesis, it has also been implemented in a numerical program and used to test the influence of a number of design parameters on the performance of a hydrosupport. It has been shown that, using the contact between the sliding surfaces, the <b>tilting</b> <b>stiffness</b> of a bearing with 1 small recess is comparable to that of the 4 -recess bearing. Additionally, a 1 recess bearing requires a smaller or even no restrictor and therefore a smaller supply pump. Furthermore, {{it has been shown that}} the hydrofender with its large length/width ratio has comparable or even better performance than the circular hydrofoot, while requiring a narrower track. In addition, it has been shown that, for a given load, a hydrofender with a small bearing thickness and with a standard elastic support design exhibits a smaller flow rate and larger bearing coefficient than a bearing with an ideal support design. Finally, using the results of these parametric studies, a procedure has been developed for the design of hydrosupports. This procedure has been used in two examples.

40|$|Fractures of {{the distal}} radius are with 10 % the most {{frequent}} fractures of the human skeleton. In order to stabilize the fracture which is essential for succesful bone-healing, distal volar compression using dorsal compression plates is often used. Among the most important, but until now sparsely investigated criteria for implant-quality is the fatigue behaviour {{of the system of}} radius and stabilizing implant. Several types of implants were tested in combination with synthetic bones in the fatigue regime. The fatigue behaviour of samples was characterized using the parameters <b>stiffness,</b> <b>tilting</b> angle and reduction of the fracture gap which can be expressed by the permanent deformation of the system.

Tissue stiffness {{is affected by}} muscle tone as well as age-related changes in muscle and connective tissue. Method: The Myoton- 3 measured tissue stiffness in 40 healthy adults, including equal numbers {{of men and women}} in each of two age groups: 18 – 40 years and 60 + years. Data were collected from relaxed muscles at the masseter, cheek, and lateral tongue surfaces in two positions: reclined on the side and seated with head <b>tilted.</b> Results: Tissue <b>stiffness</b> differed across age, sex, and measurement site with multiple interaction effects. Overall, older subjects exhibited higher stiffness coefficients and oscillation frequency measures than younger subjects whereas sex differences varied by tissue site. Effects of body position were inconsistent across tissue site and measurement.

These data raise several considerations for the development of accurate normative data and for future diagnostic applications of tissue stiffness assessment...|$|R
