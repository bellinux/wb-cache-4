5|$|With Irvine, Nomura {{tried to}} strike a balance between not overshadowing Squall and not {{becoming}} too unattractive. He gave Irvine a handsome appearance, but a casual personality, hoping that this would make him less attractive than Squall. Keeping with this idea, Nomura gave him goggles; however, this idea was abandoned in favor of an American cowboy-like appearance <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>him</b> apart from other goggle-wearing characters in the Final Fantasy series.|$|E
5|$|Having {{recognized}} {{one of the}} men {{living in}} the safe house as former small-time criminal Mustaffa Karami (Kais Nashef), Salaam takes Karami into the desert and coerces him into working for Jordanian intelligence, threatening <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>him</b> up as a collaborator if he does not co-operate. Hoffman asks Salaam to use Karami, but he refuses, believing a greater return will come later. Unknown to Ferris and Salaam, Hoffman tells Ferris' CIA subordinate (Skip) to follow Karami and kidnap him. Karami escapes and notifies the terrorists in the safe house that it is being watched, and they abandon it. Ferris's partner is caught and Salaam accuses Ferris of having had knowledge of the move on Karami, and blames Ferris's duplicity with him for the destruction of the safe house. He exiles Ferris from Jordan.|$|E

The date goes well, but Theodore hesitates to promise when he will see her again, so she insults him and leaves. Theodore {{mentions}} this to Samantha, and they talk about relationships. Theodore explains that, although he and Amy (Amy Adams) dated briefly in college, they are only good friends, and that Amy is married. Theodore and Samantha's intimacy grows through a verbal sexual encounter. They develop a relationship that reflects positively in Theodore's writing and well-being, and in Samantha's enthusiasm to grow and learn.|$|E

When the staff started to turn against Dom after Avril's sister Bernadette (Kate Louise-Elliot) accused him of murder, he faked mental illness and after escaping a psych ward, he lured Chris to a barn and tried <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>him</b> on fire. Unsuccessful, Dom ended up getting caught in a large explosion. With intense burns, Dom finally admitted to killing Geoff and Avril before he died in Toni's arms.|$|E

Throughout the trial and up until his execution, Guiteau was housed at St. Elizabeths Hospital in the southeastern quadrant of Washington, D.C. While in prison and awaiting execution, Guiteau wrote a defense of the assassination he had committed and an account of his own trial, which was published as The Truth and the Removal.|$|E

The topic of the essay, set by university vice-chancellor Peter Peckard, was Anne liceat invitos in servitutem dare ("Is it lawful to enslave the unconsenting?"), and it led Clarkson to consider the question of the slave trade. He read everything he could on the subject, including the works of Anthony Benezet, a Quaker abolitionist, as well as first hand accounts of the African slave trade such as Francis Moore's Travels into the Interior Parts of Africa. Appalled and challenged by what he discovered, Clarkson changed his life. He also researched the topic by meeting and interviewing those who had personal experience of the slave trade and of slavery.|$|E

Jack and Chance fatally shoot each other, and Masters escapes. Vukovich gives chase, {{going to a}} warehouse a previous informant had told them about. By the time he arrives, Masters has set fire to everything inside, destroying all evidence. Vukovich confronts Masters and during a brief struggle, Masters asks Vukovich why {{he did not take}} Grimes' advice to turn his partner in, revealing that Grimes was working on Masters' behalf all along. While Vukovich is stunned at the revelation, Masters grabs a board and knocks him unconscious. Masters then covers Vukovich with shredded paper and is about <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>him</b> on fire when Vukovich wakes up and shoots Masters. Masters drops his lighter and accidentally sets himself ablaze, while Vukovich empties his gun on the burning man, killing him.|$|E
25|$|Episode one, 'Tony', is an {{ensemble}} piece that introduces {{the characters and}} the format. We meet the effortlessly attractive, popular and intelligent Tony as he arranges for his friends to attend a party held by upper-class girl Abigail Stock (Georgina Moffat). The second episode, 'Cassie', focuses on Cassie's final visit to an eating disorder clinic {{under the supervision of}} Abigail's mother Dr Stock. In her day-to-day life, she hallucinates messages instructing her to eat which seem to come from Sid, for whom she develops feelings. Jal's episode follows her attempt to win BBC Young Musician of the Year, and her strained relationship with her famous musician father. When a drug dealer 'Mad Twatter' smashes her clarinet as pay back for Sid not giving him money for drugs he bought, Jal's father sees to it he will not bother the gang again. In 'Chris', Chris' mother abandons him, leaving £1,000 in cash. He blows the money on a party, and is eventually helped into temporary student accommodation by his psychology teacher, Angie (Siwan Morris). Episode five, 'Sid', shows Sid's struggle with his parents' break-up while Tony organises a scheme <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>him</b> up with Michelle. A heartbroken and fragile Cassie attempts suicide by drug overdose.|$|E

500|$|The show {{centers on}} Michael Britten (Jason Isaacs), a police detective living in two {{separate}} realities after a car accident. In this episode, John Copper (Clifton Powell), a convict that Michael arrested 10 years ago, escapes from jail. Tara (Michaela McManus) and Rex (Dylan Minnette) go to tennis practice. Cooper hits the car Rex is in, incapacitates Tara, and kidnaps Rex. John kidnaps him for [...] "justice", claiming that he was innocent. Michael later finds out in the [...] "red reality", that Jim Mayhew (William Russ) had framed him for murder. He wears a wire <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>him</b> up, and obtains a confession.

500|$|Tony Last is {{a country}} gentleman, living with his wife Brenda and his eight-year-old son John Andrew in his ancestral home, Hetton Abbey. The house, a Victorian pseudo-Gothic {{pastiche}} described as architecturally [...] "devoid of interest" [...] by a local guide book and [...] "ugly" [...] by his wife, but is Tony's pride and joy. Entirely content with country life, he is seemingly unaware of Brenda's increasing boredom and dissatisfaction, and of his son's developing waywardness. Brenda meets John Beaver and, despite acknowledging his dullness and insignificance, she begins an affair with him. Brenda starts spending her weeks in London, and persuades Tony to finance a small flat, which she rents from John's mother, Mrs Beaver, an unscrupulous property developer. Although the Brenda–Beaver liaison is well known to their London friends, Tony remains uxorious and oblivious; attempts by Brenda and her friends <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>him</b> up with a mistress are absurdly unsuccessful.|$|E

Ariel is charged to prepare the proper sailing weather to guide the King's ship back to the Royal fleet and then to Naples, where Ferdinand and Miranda will be married. After discharging this task, Ariel will finally be free. Prospero pardons Caliban, who is sent to prepare Prospero's cell, to which Alonso and his party are invited for a final night before their departure. (It is, however, not made clear whether, after their departure, Caliban will remain on the island or whether he will be taken to Naples.) Prospero indicates {{that he intends to}} entertain them with the story of his life on the island.

500|$|In April 1967 Scott {{wrote to}} Bessell from Ireland, {{asking for help}} in obtaining a {{passport}} in his changed name {{so that he could}} begin a new life in America. A second, less positive letter, dated July, indicated that Scott had returned to England and was once again in difficulties, with medical bills and other debts. His lack of an insurance card prevented him from claiming benefits. By this time, Thorpe had succeeded Jo Grimond as leader of the Liberal Party. To resolve Scott's immediate problems, and to prevent a resumption of his tirades against the new party leader, Bessell began paying him a [...] "retainer" [...] of between £5 and £10 a week, ostensibly in lieu of lost national insurance benefits. Bessell also arranged Scott's new passport, but by this time Scott had abandoned his American plans and wished to establish a career as a model. He asked Bessell for £200 <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>him</b> up; Bessell refused, but in May 1968 gave him £75, on the understanding there would be no further demands for a year.|$|E
500|$|On a {{potential}} sequel, Norton said, [...] "The {{whole thing was}} to envision it in multiple parts. We left a lot out on purpose. [...] definitely intended as chapter one." [...] Leterrier made the film's final shot of Banner ambiguous; the thought being {{if there is a}} sequel, it would mean Banner finally masters control over his anger; if there is not a sequel, the shot indicates instead that he becomes a menace in The Avengers. Leterrier had also intended for a scene in the credits showing Blonsky, human once more, imprisoned and chained in a box. The character of Samuel Sterns, played by Tim Blake Nelson, was introduced <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>him</b> up as a villain in a possible future film, where he would become the Leader. Aaron Sims, the lead designer on The Incredible Hulk, also took time to work on concepts for the Leader. Nelson is [...] "signed on" [...] to reprise the role.
