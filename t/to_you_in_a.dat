500|$|One of my very {{greatest}} fears as a {{child was}} being ridiculed in public. And there it was coming true. As a television presenter, I'd been respected. People {{come up to you}} in the street and shake your hand and talk <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> respectful way. And suddenly, overnight, this was transformed into [...] "Icke's a nutter." [...] I couldn't walk down any street in Britain without being laughed at. It was a nightmare. My children were devastated because their dad was a figure of ridicule.|$|E
500|$|The {{track is}} built on a {{recreation}} of electronic musician Aphex Twin's piano composition [...] "Avril 14th". The song begins with a minute long introduction sung by Legend. [...] "Blame Game" [...] has a lush, cello-driven production with predominant piano. After Legend's introduction, West raps his verses in a highly melodic manner, almost singing his lines. West's forceful delivery expresses hurt and contempt. The song's soulful sound juxtaposes West's angry lyrics: [...] "been {{a long time since}} I spoke <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bathroom, ripping you up, fuckin' and chokin' you". He subsequently raps less antagonistically and repeatedly confesses [...] "I can't love you this much".|$|E
2500|$|In overview, {{the works}} for the double album in this period were {{intended}} to be packaged in a plain brown wrapper, with a [...] "strictly personal" [...] over-stamp and addressed {{in a manner that}} could have connotations of drug content, pornographic or illicit material; As per the small ads of the time: [...] "It comes <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> plain brown wrapper." [...] Given that Krasnow had effectively poached the band from Buddah there were limitations on what material could be released. Strictly Personal was the result, contained in its enigmatically-addressed parcel sleeve. The raft of material left behind eventually emerged, firstly on CD as I May Be Hungry, But I Sure Ain't Weird and later on vinyl, implemented by John French, as It Comes <b>To</b> <b>You</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Plain Brown Wrapper (which has two tracks that are missing from the former release). Both Blue Thumb and the stamps on the cover of Strictly Personal have LSD connotations, as does the track Ah Feel Like Ahcid, although Beefheart himself refuted this (claiming that this is a rendering of [...] "I feel like I said").|$|E

2500|$|In August 1967, guitarist Jeff Cotton {{filled the}} guitar spot vacated, in turn, by Cooder and McGee. In October and November 1967 the Snouffer/Cotton/Handley/French line–up {{recorded}} material {{for what was}} planned to be the second album. Originally {{intended to be a}} double album called It Comes <b>to</b> <b>You</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Plain Brown Wrapper for the [...] label, it was released later in pieces in 1971 and 1995. After rejection from Buddah, Bob Krasnow encouraged the band to re-record four of the shorter numbers, add two more, and make shorter versions of [...] "Mirror Man" [...] and [...] "Kandy Korn". Krasnow created a strange mix full of [...] "phasing" [...] that, by most accounts (including Beefheart's), diminished the music's strength. This was released in October 1968 as Strictly Personal on Krasnow's Blue Thumb label. Stewart Mason in his Allmusic review of the album described it as a [...] "terrific album" [...] and a [...] "fascinating, underrated release... every bit the equal of Safe as Milk and Trout Mask Replica". Langdon Winner of Rolling Stone called Strictly Personal [...] "an excellent album. The guitars of the Magic Band mercilessly bend and stretch notes in a way that suggests that the world of music has wobbled clear off its axis," [...] with the lyrics demonstrating [...] "...Beefheart's ability to juxtapose delightful humor with frightening insights." ...|$|E
2500|$|Much of the pregame hype {{surrounded}} {{the conflict between}} Parcells and Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Kraft {{took control of the}} team after Parcells was hired, {{and the two of them}} had different ideas on how to run the organization. Six days before the Super Bowl, in an article by Will McDonough, the Boston Globe reported Parcells would leave the Patriots after the Super Bowl to become the coach of the New York Jets. The book Patriot Reign alleges the Patriots have cell phone records showing Parcells was in constant contact with the Jets during the week. Then-Patriots defensive coordinator (and now head coach) Bill Belichick is quoted as saying Parcells' plans to leave for the Jets were a distraction, [...] "Yeah, I'd say it was a little bit of a distraction all the way around. I can tell you first-hand, there was a lot of stuff going on prior to the game. I mean, him talking to other teams. He was trying to make up his mind about what he was going to do. Which, honestly, I felt [...] totally inappropriate. How many chances do you get to play for the Super Bowl? Tell them to get back <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> couple of days. I'm not saying it was disrespectful to me, but it was in terms of the overall commitment to the team." [...] Parcells even refused to travel back with the rest of the Patriots after the game, and was eventually hired by the rival Jets.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Smythe's letter {{probably}} passed {{under my}} nose {{on its way}} to lose three weeks traveling to America and back, and gave me a whiff of its contents as it went along. Letters often act like that. Instead of the thought coming <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> instant from Australia, the (apparently) unsentient letter imparts it <b>to</b> <b>you</b> as it glides invisibly past your elbow in the mail-bag.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bah!" [...] said Brough, [...] "are {{you going}} to be about this letter all day, my good fellow? Listen to me, and I'll dictate <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> moment." [...] So he began:-- ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'You {{overwhelm}} me. Such noble {{trust and}} generosity {{as you have}} shown me demands a return of trust. But I must think! Will you remain here and let me return <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> little while?' ...|$|E
