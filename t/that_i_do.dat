5|$|Basically it’s {{just about}} having a throwdown {{out in the woods}} — that’s what we used to do in high school. I can’t {{honestly}} sit here and say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> it much anymore, I’m getting too old, but it’s fun for me to sing about those times and the crazy stuff that I used to do, and the crazy stuff that I know somewhere, as we speak right now, kids are doing somewhere in somebody's field. I know you're tearing it up out there.|$|E

For what she has really suffered, there is never a sober night <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not pay a stark tribute of an hour to in the darkness. In an odd way, perhaps incredible to you, she was always my child (it was not reciprocal as it often is in marriages)... I was her great reality, often the only liaison agent who could make the world tangible to her.|$|E
5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E

25|$|Merleau-Ponty {{demonstrates}} a corporeity of consciousness {{as much as}} an intentionality of the body, and so stands in contrast with the dualist ontology of mind and body in Descartes, a philosopher to whom Merleau-Ponty continually returned, despite the important differences that separate them. In the Phenomenology of Perception Merleau-Ponty wrote: “Insofar as I have hands, feet; a body, I sustain around me intentions which are not dependent on my decisions and which affect my surroundings in a way <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not choose” (1962, p.440).|$|E

Sybil converted and became a devout Catholic, but Keable also read works in contemporary philosophy and the books of Charles Darwin, and appears briefly to have lost his faith altogether. He wrote, {{of the history of}} Christianity, [...] "I can see creative evolution at work. What is behind it, I don't know.

500|$|By early 1868, the U.S. {{government}} desired {{a peaceful}} settlement to Red Cloud's War. It agreed to Red Cloud's {{demands that the}} US abandon forts Phil Kearny and C.F. Smith. Gall of the Hunkpapa (among other representatives of the Hunkpapa, Blackfeet, and Yankton Dakota) signed a form of the Treaty of Fort Laramie on July 2, 1868 at Fort Rice (near Bismarck, North Dakota). Sitting Bull did not agree to the treaty. He told the Jesuit missionary, Pierre Jean De Smet, who sought him out {{on behalf of the}} government: [...] “I wish all to know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not propose to sell any part of part of my country.” He continued his hit-and-run attacks on forts in the upper Missouri area throughout the late 1860s and early 1870s.|$|E
500|$|Hartman {{provided}} the voices for numerous characters on the Fox animated series The Simpsons, appearing in 52 episodes. He {{made his first}} appearance in the second season episode [...] "Bart Gets Hit by a Car". Although he was originally brought in for a one-time appearance, Hartman enjoyed working on The Simpsons and the staff wrote additional parts for him. He voiced the recurring characters Lionel Hutz and Troy McClure, {{as well as several}} one-time and background characters. His favourite part was that of McClure, and he often used this voice to entertain the audience between takes while taping episodes of NewsRadio. He remarked, [...] "My favorite fans are Troy McClure fans." [...] He added [...] "It's the one thing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> in my life that's almost an avocation.

500|$|In a 2009 interview, Sevigny {{reflected}} on her career, {{and said she}} was content with the level of stardom she had maintained: [...] "When I was in my early 20s, I went out with a British pop star, Jarvis Cocker; of course, pop stars have much more celebrity, I think, than actors even. They're really hunted by their fans much more. I remember driving around these remote towns in Wales and kids running after us in the street. I was like, 'This is horrible!' And I saw the effect it had on him, and that's when I decided I never wanted to be a celebrity at that level, and I think that's why I've chosen to do the work <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> and just kind of work with directors that I love and try and do work that means something to me." ...|$|E
500|$|Keith Thornton, {{best known}} by the stage name Kool Keith, {{released}} the album Dr. Octagonecologyst in 1996, under the name Dr. Octagon, produced by Dan [...] "The Automator" [...] Nakamura.

[...] In 1999, Thornton released the album First Come, First Served, which featured a track in which the newly introduced character Dr. Dooom murdered Dr. Octagon.

500|$|Allmusic {{reviewer}} Steve Huey {{wrote that}} Dr. Octagonecologyst [...] "...attracted {{more attention than}} any non-mainstream rap album in quite a while, thanks to its inventive production and Keith's bizarre, free-associative rhymes." [...] Huey also states that Dr. Octagonecologyst represented [...] "...the first truly new, genuine alternative to commercial hip-hop since the Native Tongues' heyday. It appealed strongly to alternative audiences who'd grown up with rap music, but simply hadn't related to it since the rise of gangsta". Thornton expressed some frustration with the Dr. Octagon nickname, saying, [...] "I just made a record. I was an artist on a project, and I think people [...] that I was an artist on a project.
