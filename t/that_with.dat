5|$|As indicated, hospice is {{frequently}} under-utilized and often not {{taken advantage of}} until very late in a patient's illness. The reasons for this have {{as much to do}} with financial considerations as with the psycho-social difficulty in choosing hospice. A 2009 study found <b>that</b> <b>with</b> proper case management hospice access could be liberalized without additional costs to insurers.|$|E

40|$|Intraspecific or {{interspecific}} {{competition is}} then fundamentally the same: scramble competition {{is a good}} example of this type of competition. Modern ecology increasingly is faced with the question whether the data or a paper provide evidence for the statement that is made or for testing the hypotheses one believes in. Much of the research on antelopes and ungulates in general suffers from an exuberance of possible causes to explain numerical changes in study populations. Multi-causality is the bane of community ecology. The issue of facilitation of antelopes by zebra has been a long-running theme in African savanna ecology. The cases of competition are as follows: small antelopes competing <b>with</b> giraffe, cattle <b>that</b> compete <b>with</b> gaur, cattle <b>that</b> compete <b>with</b> deer, cattle <b>that</b> compete <b>with</b> impala, cattle <b>that</b> compete <b>with</b> buffalo, and buffalo <b>that</b> compete <b>with</b> African elephant and possibly blue wildebeest <b>that</b> compete <b>with</b> African elephant. </p...|$|R
5|$|Maureen Ryan {{believed}} {{that one of}} the reasons the episode worked so well was because it left out the storylines with the Night's Watch and the Dothraki and focused in a single location.

However, following the commencement of the war against Japan, Nash enlisted on 2 February 1942.|$|E
