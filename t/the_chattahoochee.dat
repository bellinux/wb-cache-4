25|$|The Central of Georgia {{spun off}} {{a portion of}} their line from Hartford to Dothan to the Hartford & Slocomb {{railroad}} in 1953, which was later abandoned from Hartford to Taylors in 1992. In 2003, Central of Georgia successor Norfolk Southern sold their route from Dothan to Hilton, Georgia, to <b>the</b> <b>Chattahoochee</b> and Gulf shortline, leaving CSXT as the last Class I railroad operating through Dothan. In 2003 the Genesee & Wyoming purchased the Bay Line, and in 2006 bought the H and Chattahoochee and Gulf railroads, merging the latter two into <b>the</b> <b>Chattahoochee</b> Bay Railroad.|$|E

25|$|Columbus {{is a city}} in the U.S. {{state of}} Georgia and the county seat of Muscogee County, with which it is consolidated. According to the 2013 {{estimates}} from the U.S. Census Bureau, Columbus {{has a population of}} 202,824 residents, with 316,554 in the greater Columbus-Phenix City metropolitan area. The metro area joins the nearby Alabama cities of Auburn and Opelika to form the Columbus-Auburn-Opelika Combined Statistical Area, which has an estimated population of 501,649. Columbus is directly to the east across <b>the</b> <b>Chattahoochee</b> River from Phenix City, Alabama. Situated at the heart of <b>the</b> <b>Chattahoochee</b> Valley, Columbus is Georgia's second-largest city and fourth-largest metropolitan area.|$|E
25|$|Encompassing {{nearly two-thirds}} of the county, <b>the</b> <b>Chattahoochee</b> National Forest has winding trails that lead {{visitors}} through scenic mountains, rushing rivers, and cascading waterfalls. This is where you can step back in time with nature and walk where the Cherokee Indians once lived.|$|E
25|$|The {{state line}} {{begins in the}} Atlantic Ocean, {{traveling}} west, south, and north up the thalweg of the Saint Mary's River. At the origin of that river, it then follows a straight line nearly due west and slightly north, {{to the point where}} the confluence of the Flint River (from Georgia) and <b>the</b> <b>Chattahoochee</b> River (down the Alabama/Georgia line) used to form Florida's Apalachicola River. (Since Woodruff Dam was built, this point has been under Lake Seminole.) The border with Georgia continues north through the lake for a short distance up the former thalweg of <b>the</b> <b>Chattahoochee,</b> then with Alabama runs due west along 31°N to the Perdido River, then south along its thalweg to the Gulf via Perdido Bay. Much of the state is at or near sea level.|$|E

25|$|The colonials quickly {{gathered}} militia who retaliated {{against the}} Cherokee. North Carolina sent Rutherford with 2400 militia to scour the Oconaluftee and Tuckasegee river valleys, and {{the headwaters of}} the Little Tennessee and Hiwassee.

25|$|Alabama uses {{water of}} the ACF River Basin {{for a variety of}} purposes, {{including}} agriculture, industry, fisheries, recreation, preservation of habitats and biodiversity, power generation, navigation, and water quality, all of which may be limited by Atlanta's growing usage. Alabama's goals during the ACF negotiations have been to ensure adequate water levels of <b>the</b> <b>Chattahoochee</b> River through the Alabama cities of Phenix City and Columbia, perpetuation of waste assimilation and water use permits in the middle regions of <b>the</b> <b>Chattahoochee</b> River, continuation of the Corps' projects such as hydropower and flood control, preservation of water levels of Alabama's West Point Lake and Lake Eufaula, and ensuring that neither current or future plans adversely affect the stated goals. During the drought of 2007, the state of Georgia had statewide water restrictions, but the city of Phenix City, Alabama failed to enact water restrictions on their customers.|$|E

25|$|In 1767, the British {{moved the}} {{northern}} boundary of West Florida {{to a line}} extending {{from the mouth of}} the Yazoo River east to <b>the</b> <b>Chattahoochee</b> River (32° 28′north latitude), consisting of approximately the lower third of the present states of Mississippi and Alabama. During this time, Creek Indians migrated into Florida and formed the Seminole tribe.|$|E
25|$|Auburn sits {{near the}} divide between <b>the</b> <b>Chattahoochee</b> and Tallapoosa River watersheds. Auburn is drained by three main creek systems: in the south, by the Chewacla/Opintlocco Creek system; in the north, by the Saugahatchee Creek system; and in the extreme {{northern}} reaches of Auburn by Sandy Creek. The dividing line between the Chewacla and Saugahatchee watersheds roughly follows railroad line east–west {{through the center of}} town.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{perhaps as}} early as 1675, and {{definitely}} by the mid-1680s, Woodward was traveling to the southwest of modern Georgia, visiting the Indian towns along the lower Chattahoochee River such as Coweta and Cussita (later to be key towns of the Creek Nation). He led a dozen other Charles Town traders to <b>the</b> <b>Chattahoochee</b> Indians. These traders took over the business after Woodward's death.|$|E

25|$|The state's western border {{runs in a}} {{straight}} line south-southeastward from a point southwest of Chattanooga, to meet <b>the</b> <b>Chattahoochee</b> River near West Point. It continues downriver {{to the point where it}} joins the Flint River (the confluence of the two forming Florida's Apalachicola River); the southern border goes almost due east and very slightly south, in {{a straight}} line to the St. Mary's River, which then forms the remainder of the boundary back to the ocean.|$|E
25|$|Writing {{about the}} exploit, Corporal William Pittenger {{said that the}} {{remaining}} raiders worried about also being executed. They attempted to escape and eight succeeded. Traveling for hundreds of miles in pairs, they all made it back safely to Union lines, including two who were aided by slaves and Union sympathizers and two who floated down <b>the</b> <b>Chattahoochee</b> River until they were rescued by the Union blockade vessel USS Somerset. The remaining six were held as prisoners of war and exchanged for Confederate prisoners on March 17, 1863.|$|E
25|$|The {{intersection}} of SR369 and US19/SR400 is {{just north of}} the end of the limited-access portion of US19/SR400 at exit17. East of US19/SR400, now locally known as Browns Bridge Road, SR369 crosses the northern branches of Lake Lanier in Forsyth County, before crossing the main channel (originally <b>the</b> <b>Chattahoochee</b> River) of the lake via Browns Bridge into Hall County. The route then becomes Jesse Jewell Parkway once it reaches SR13 in Gainesville, and forms a major thoroughfare in Gainesville, before it reaches its eastern terminus at I-985/US23.|$|E
