5|$|Pooja {{is invited}} to stay at her parents' house, and Prem takes her there. When they arrive, Pooja learns that Prem and Nisha are in love, and gives Nisha a {{necklace}} as a token, promising to get them married. Shortly afterwards, Pooja accidentally slips and falls down <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> <b>and</b> dies from a head injury. Everybody is shattered by the tragedy.|$|E
5|$|The {{standards}} and balusters {{of the stairs}} {{on the north side}} of the hall came from Eversley Manor House and probably date to the mid-17th century, although the treads are original to the house and possibly mid-16th century. The walls above <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> on the first-floor landing contain some very large paintings, including several portraits.|$|E
5|$|Bin Laden {{peered through}} his bedroom {{door at the}} Americans {{advancing}} up <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> <b>and</b> then retreated into the room as the lead SEAL fired a shot at him, which either missed or {{hit him in the}} side. Robert O’Neill, who later publicly identified himself as the SEAL who shot bin Laden, rolled through the door and confronted bin Laden inside the bedroom. Seymour Hersh reports that, according to his sources, bin Laden was found cowering and shot dead.|$|E

5|$|Borobudur was {{considered}} {{as the source}} of souvenirs, and parts of its sculptures were looted, some even with colonial-government consent. In 1896 King Chulalongkorn of Siam visited Java and requested and was allowed to take home eight cartloads of sculptures taken from Borobudur. These include thirty pieces taken from a number of relief panels, five buddha images, two lions, one gargoyle, several kala motifs from <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> gateways, and a guardian statue (dvarapala). Several of these artifacts, most notably the lions, dvarapala, kala, makara and giant waterspouts are now on display in the Java Art room in The National Museum in Bangkok.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s the lifts to the Piccadilly line {{platforms}} {{were replaced by}} escalators, with one pair being provided between the ticket hall and a new intermediate level, where it met a linking passageway to the Circle and District line platforms, and three being provided from there to a lower concourse between the levels of the two Piccadilly line platforms. Stairs up and down from the lower concourse connect to the platforms. <b>The</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> passage to the westbound platform {{are located in the}} disused DR westbound platform tunnel. With the introduction of escalators, the GNP station building was taken out of use.|$|E
5|$|The same {{cauldron}} {{was used}} as in the 1932 Summer Games. The orchestra played The Olympian composed and conducted by Philip Glass. The torch enters the stadium carried by Rafer Johnson, he completes a lap as mechanical steps rise {{from the center of}} the peristalses. He climbs <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> stands and faces the crowd as The Olympian is still being played. After a minute, he lights the gas powered Olympic rings that connect with the Olympic cauldron. The flame is lit to the cheers from the crowd. The athlete and judges oaths are taken and a children's chorus appears. They perform ode to joy.|$|E
60|$|At that {{critical}} moment a quick step was heard upon <b>the</b> <b>stair,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> next moment the Reverend Frank Selby entered the room.|$|R
60|$|The boy {{turned away}} sulkily, and began {{picking up the}} {{scattered}} chess-men. The two men walked down <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> <b>and</b> strolled together through the garden.|$|R
50|$|Internally, the {{entrance}} foyer has a timber panelled dado, and timber panelling surrounding the reception. The reception counter has an adjacent notice board, {{and both are}} surmounted by timber pediments with the names ENQUIRY and NOTICES in relief. A central corridor runs {{the length of the}} building, and a concrete half-turn <b>stair</b> with landings <b>and</b> metal balustrade is located opposite {{the entrance}} foyer. <b>The</b> <b>stair</b> <b>and</b> entrance foyer are separated from the corridor by segmental arches with expressed keystone, voussoirs and impost mouldings. A timber door, with a multi-paned glass upper panel, is located below <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> <b>and</b> accesses <b>the</b> ground floor of the toilet block at the rear. A second door is located on the upper landing of <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> <b>and</b> accesses <b>the</b> upper level of the toilet block. The building has rendered masonry walls, fibrous cement ceilings with timber battens, and linoleum floor coverings to public spaces.|$|R
5|$|After 1:00pm on 30 April 1945, Braun and Hitler {{said their}} farewells to staff {{and members of}} the inner circle. Later that afternoon, at {{approximately}} 3:30pm, several people reported hearing a loud gunshot. After waiting a few minutes, Hitler's valet, Heinz Linge, and Hitler's SS adjutant, Otto Günsche, entered the small study and found the lifeless bodies of Hitler and Braun on a small sofa. Braun had bitten into a cyanide capsule, and Hitler had shot himself in the right temple with his pistol. The corpses were carried up <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> through the bunker's emergency exit to the garden behind the Reich Chancellery, where they were burned. Braun was 33 years old when she died.|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} of the Concealed Shoe Index maintained by Northampton Museum, conducted by June Swann and published in 1996, reveals that the most common place of concealment is the chimney, fireplace or hearth (26.2 per cent), followed by under the floor or above the ceiling (22.9 per cent), and almost as many concealed in the roof. Shoes have also been found around doors and windows, under <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> <b>and</b> among the foundations. Concealed shoes have been discovered in many types of building: country cottages, town houses, manor houses, hospitals, workhouses, factories, public houses, and two Oxford colleges, St John's and Queen's. They have even been found in ecclesiastical buildings, including a Benedictine monastery in Germany and a Baptist church in Cheshire, England.|$|E
5|$|At around 20:30, Goebbels and Magda {{left the}} bunker {{and walked up}} to the garden of the Chancellery, where they {{committed}} suicide. There are several different accounts of this event. According to one account, Goebbels shot Magda and then himself. Another account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule and were given a coup de grâce immediately afterwards. Goebbels' SS adjutant Günther Schwägermann testified in 1948 that they walked ahead of him up <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> out into the Chancellery garden. He waited in the stairwell and heard the shots sound. Schwägermann then walked up the remaining stairs and, once outside, saw their lifeless bodies. Following Goebbels' prior order, Schwägermann had an SS soldier fire several shots into his body, which did not move.|$|E

5|$|Carbon dating {{carried out}} at the University of Edinburgh dated the skull to between 1650 and 1880, while {{the fact that it}} had been {{deposited}} on top of a layer of Victorian tiles suggested that it belonged to the end of this era. The skull had fracture marks consistent with Webster's account of throwing Thomas down <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> <b>and</b> it was found to have low collagen levels, consistent with it being boiled. In July 2011, the coroner concluded that the skull was indeed that of Thomas. DNA testing was not possible as she had died childless and no relatives could be traced; in addition, there was no record of where the rest of her body had been buried.|$|E
5|$|During one of {{the work}} parties, Stanley was sent to build a road and stairs leading to a {{memorial}} to the Japanese dead on Bukit Batok Hill (Marked with a Bukit Batok Memorial plaque today, only <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> road called Lorong Sesuai are still there to be seen). The chaplain of the regiment, well aware of Stanley's religious conviction and artistic background, requested him to decorate the asbestos walls at the altar area of a small open attap-roofed chapel at Bukit Batok. With charcoal salvaged from around the camp, he drew two murals: Nativity, which featured a Malay Madonna and Descent from the Cross in which he included soldiers in uniforms, using his comrades as models. By then, he was becoming ill and was suffering from a severe renal disorder complicated by amoebic dysentery. On 23 May 1942, Stanley was lying comatose and was sent to Roberts Barracks in Changi which was converted {{for use as a}} hospital for POWs to recuperate.|$|E
5|$|Sabrina (Chaplin) {{walks down}} <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> <b>and</b> Ray puts the {{painting}} back and hides. Sabrina turns down Gerald's music to watch EastEnders. Gerald returns, sitting away from Sabrina. He turns up his {{music and the}} pair fight over the television remote, before leaving through the patio door and arguing, though their voices are muffled. Ray cuts away the canvas and replaces it with kitchen roll. When Sabrina reenters, she unknowingly stands on the canvas. Kim picks it up, mistaking it for laundry, and heads into a laundry room as Sabrina walks upstairs. Eddie follows Kim and she sprays something into his eyes. Ray knocks out Kim and sees the canvas in a laundry basket, which is sent up a laundry chute. He runs upstairs, while Gerald remains outside.|$|E

5|$|The car speeds {{over the}} French {{countryside}} {{and into the}} Alps, leaping between mountains and knocking over a postman as it goes. At the gates of Dijon, town officials {{try to stop the}} car to enforce the octroi tax, but the car keeps its course and runs headlong into one of the officials, who explodes in his turn. The car wends its way across the Mediterranean coast, overturning a fruit stand, crashing through a greenhouse, colliding with a tar wagon (with another explosion ensuing), and, finally, arriving at the grandstand of spectators awaiting them at Monte Carlo. The car is now going at such speed that, rather than stopping in front of the grandstand, it somersaults up <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> crashes to earth. The King and chauffeur, unharmed by their adventurous race, are greeted warmly.|$|E
5|$|The {{south tower}} forms an unequal {{pentagon}} in shape, and has three storeys with thick walls. The walls were built to contain <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> garderobes, the unevenly positioned empty spaces weakening the structure, and {{this meant that}} two large buttresses had {{to be added to}} the tower during its construction to support the walls. The current floors are Victorian in origin, having been built after the fire of 1830, but the tower remains unglazed, as in the 13th century, with shutters at the windows providing protection in winter. The basement was originally only accessible from the first floor, and would have provided a secure area for storage, in addition to also containing a well. The first floor, which formed the original entrance to the tower, contains a 17th-century fireplace, reusing the original 13th-century chimney. The second floor has been subdivided in the past, but has been restored to form a single chamber, as it would have been when first built.|$|E
5|$|Becky, still crushed {{over her}} {{betrayal}} by Steve, stays with Roy and Hayley. While Fiz Stape (Jennie McAlpine) is in prison, Becky takes part in helping Hayley {{take care of}} baby Hope (Harriet Atkins and Sadie Pilbury), whom she grows very close to and struggles to hand her back to Fiz. Becky is upset when she discovers that Tracy is pregnant with Steve's twins. Becky goes on a business meeting with Steve and attempts to seduce him, while Tracy suffers a miscarriage. Tracy assumes Steve is sleeping with Becky and goes to see her. Tracy falls down <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> pretends to have only just lost her babies and blames Becky. When everyone turns against her, Becky gets drunk and burns photographs of herself and Steve which causes a fire in her flat. Becky is saved from the fire by Nick Tilsley (Ben Price) and vows to gain revenge on Tracy. Becky begins dating Danny Stratton (Jeremy Sheffield) who later reveals that Tracy lost the babies before her fall. Gail McIntyre (Helen Worth) helps Becky retrieve Tracy's medical records which confirm she is lying. Becky exposes Tracy's lies at her wedding reception. Becky decides to go to Barbados with Danny and Steve attempts to stop her. Becky then boards the flight with Danny and departs.|$|E

5|$|Jeffrey {{insists on}} {{returning}} to Dorothy's apartment and tells Sandy to immediately send the police there, including her father. At Dorothy's apartment, Jeffrey finds Dorothy's husband, who is dead from a gunshot {{to the head}} and identifiable by his missing ear, {{as well as the}} Yellow Man, who bears a gruesome head wound, leaving him barely conscious and unresponsive but still standing. When Jeffrey tries to leave, he sees the Well-Dressed Man coming up <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> recognizes him as Frank in disguise. Jeffrey talks to Detective Williams over the Yellow Man's police radio, but lies about his location inside the apartment. Frank enters the apartment and brags about hearing Jeffrey's location over his own police radio. While Frank searches for him in the wrong room, Jeffrey retrieves the Yellow Man's gun and hides in the same closet in which he hid during his first visit to the apartment. Frank fires sporadically, knocking over the dead Yellow Man, who had still been standing up, and when he opens the closet door, Jeffrey fatally shoots him in the head. Detective Williams, gun drawn, enters with Sandy a moment later. Jeffrey and Sandy now go ahead with their relationship and note the unusual appearance of robins in their town. Dorothy and her son are reunited.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Chris sneaks into Meg's {{bedroom and}} reads her diary. Discovering him, Meg chases after Chris while Stewie walks by the staircase. Accidentally bumped by them, Stewie tumbles down <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> becomes unconscious, {{suffering}} a severe head wound. Chris and Meg hide the wound with a hat. Continuing the charade, they are approached by Peter, who asks how long Stewie has been unconscious. Peter reveals {{that he has}} knocked both of them out plenty of times, and wants to continue hiding Stewie's injury from Lois until he can frame her for it. The next day, noticing Lois {{pulling out of the}} driveway, Peter throws Stewie behind her car, making it appear as if Lois has run him over. Lois suggests they frame someone else, but Peter professes his love for her and suggests they take Stewie to the hospital. At the end of the show, Stewie walks in on the family with his head wrapped in bandages, revealing that many months have passed since his accident, he asks what happened to him.|$|E
5|$|It {{begins with}} a shot of Wade's face and the guitar introduction. He then sings {{the first line of}} lyrics, which is {{followed}} by a transition to a boy lying on a bed shirtless. As the video switches between Wade and the boy, it zooms on the bed frame (which has the same face from the album cover) and opens into another area. The boy is then seen walking around the new area looking around until he goes up nearby stairs. While going up the stairs, the video switches between shots of the boy going up <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> Wade singing the lyrics. Once up the stairs, the boy looks around and then walks into a bright light that he sees nearby. He walks through the bright archway into a dark room as the video switches to Lifehouse playing the song. After this, it switches to the boy as he looks up and the camera zooms out to reveal that he is in a giant maze. He then walks back where he came from to find that he is in a house with Lifehouse playing on the television. He then jumps off a window sill and appears tiny as he walks up to a book that is bigger than him. It then transitions to Lifehouse playing the song as the boy gets up on a chair which slowly transcends into his original bed. The video then zooms out on the boy lying on his bed and then switches to the band. It ends with the boy walking into darkness and Wade's face looking on the floor.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{aimed to}} compare the effects of {{different}} suspension methods on the interface stress inside the prosthetic sockets of transtibial amputees when negotiating ramps <b>and</b> <b>stairs.</b> DESIGN: Three transtibial prostheses, with a pin/lock system, a Seal-In system, and a magnetic suspension system, were created for the participants in a prospective study. Interface stress was measured as the peak pressure by using the F-socket transducers during <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> ramp negotiation. RESULTS: Twelve individuals with transtibial amputation managed to complete the experiments. During <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> ascent <b>and</b> descent, <b>the</b> greatest peak pressure was observed in the prosthesis with the Seal-In system. The magnetic prosthetic suspension system caused significantly different peak pressure at the anterior proximal region compared with the pin/lock (P = 0. 022) and Seal-In (P = 0. 001) during <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> ascent. It was also observed during <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> descent <b>and</b> ramp negotiation. CONCLUSIONS: The prostheses exhibited varying pressure profiles during <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> <b>and</b> ramp ascent. <b>The</b> prostheses with the pin/lock and magnetic suspension systems exhibited lower peak pressures compared with the Seal-In system. The intrasystem pressure distribution at the anterior and posterior regions {{of the residual limb}} was fairly homogenous during <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> <b>and</b> ramp ascent and descent. Nevertheless, the intrasystem pressure mapping revealed a significant difference among the suspension types, particularly at the anterior and posterior sensor sites...|$|R
