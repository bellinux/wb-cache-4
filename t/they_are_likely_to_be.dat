5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, small {{patches of}} pure water ice with an albedo {{as high as}} 80% are found {{on the surface of}} Callisto, surrounded by much darker material. High-resolution Galileo images showed the bright patches to be predominately located on elevated surface features: crater rims, scarps, ridges and knobs. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thin water frost deposits. Dark material usually lies in the lowlands surrounding and mantling bright features and appears to be smooth. It often forms patches up to 5km across within the crater floors and in the intercrater depressions.|$|E
5|$|Chira Endress, {{a student}} of Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, United States, focused on a section of glaciogenic sediments {{immediately}} beneath the same Ice Peak trachyte lava flow sampled and described by Jeff Hungerford during his 2006 studies. Endress ettempted {{to determine if the}} sediments were deposited immediately before the lava flow was emplaced, or if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> much older. Endress has quantified the mineralogy of clasts and sand-sized particles from samples in the sediment, and has determined that the mineralogy of several of the trachytic clasts is very similar to that in the overlying lava flow, including the minerals clinopyroxene, magnetite, alkali feldspar, and aenigmatite. Endress has also found small lenses of pristine basaltic glass, which could have derived from the Pillow Ridge subglacial mound near Mount Edziza.|$|E

5|$|Temnospondyls, {{like all}} amphibians, {{reproduced}} in aquatic environments. Most temnospondyls probably reproduced through external fertilization. Like most living frogs, female temnospondyls would have laid masses of eggs in water while males released sperm to fertilize them. Several fossils were described from the Early Permian of Texas in 1998 {{that may be}} egg masses of dissorophoid temnospondyls. They were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs. The fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probably vitelline membranes and halo-like areas surrounding them that are most likely mucous coatings. They are attached to plant fossils, suggesting that these temnospondyls laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs. The mucous membranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians, not fish (their eggs lack mucous), but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs. The eggs {{are thought to be}} from dissorophoids because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> close relatives of modern amphibians, and probably had similar reproductive strategies. They are also the most common amphibians from the deposit in which the eggs were found.|$|E
5|$|The mouse {{reference}} genome has {{at least}} 21 distinct Mup genes (with open reading frames), and a further 21 Mup pseudogenes (with reading frames disrupted by a nonsense mutation or an incomplete gene duplication). They are all clustered together, arrayed side by side across 1.92 megabases of DNA on chromosome 4. The 21 functional genes have been divided into two sub-classes based on position and sequence similarity: 6 peripheral Class A Mups, and 15 central Class B Mups. The central Class B Mup gene cluster formed {{through a number of}} sequential duplications from one of the Class A Mups. As all the Class B genes are almost identical to each other, researchers have concluded that these duplications occurred very recently in mouse evolution. Indeed, the repetitive structure of these central Mup genes means <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unstable and may vary in number among wild mice. The Class A Mups are more different from each other and are therefore likely to be more stable, older genes but what, if any, functional differences the classes have are unknown. The similarity between the genes makes the region difficult to study using current DNA sequencing technology. Consequently, the Mup gene cluster {{is one of the few}} parts of the mouse whole genome sequence with gaps remaining, and further genes may remain undiscovered.|$|E
5|$|Theta Muscae is {{a triple}} star system {{thought to be}} around 7,500light-years distant. It {{consists}} of a spectroscopic binary system composed of the Wolfâ€“Rayet star (spectral type: WC5 or 6) and an O-type main-sequence star (spectral type: O6 or O7) that orbit each other every 19 days and a blue supergiant (spectral type: O9.5/B0Iab) set about 46milliarcseconds apart from them. If the system's estimated distance from Earth is accurate, the binary stars are about 0.5astronomical units (AU) apart and the supergiant about 100AU apart from them. All three are highly luminous: combined, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> over a million times as luminous as the Sun. TU Muscae is a binary star system located around 15,500light-years away made up of two hot luminous blue main sequence stars of spectral types O7.5V and O9.5V, with masses 23 and 15times that of the Sun. The stars are so close {{that they are in}} contact with each other (overcontact binary) and are classed as a Beta Lyrae variable as their light varies from Earth as they eclipse each other. The system ranges from apparent magnitude 8.17 to 8.75 over around 1.4days.|$|E

5|$|Newborns {{have black}} natal coats and bright pink skin. Females {{are the primary}} {{caregivers}} of infants, but males also play a role. In its first few days, the infant {{may be unable to}} stay attached to its mother and relies on her for physical support. However, its grasp grows stronger by its first week and it is able to cling to its mother's fur by itself. By two weeks, the infant begins to explore its surroundings for short periods, but stays near her. The distance the infant spends away from its mother increases the older it gets. In general, higher-ranking females are usually more relaxed parents than females of lower rank, which usually keep their offspring close to them. However, this difference only lasts for approximately the first eight weeks of an infant's life. Olive baboons do not seem to practice co-operative parenting, but a female may groom an infant that is not hers. Subadult and juvenile females are more likely to care for another's young, as they have not yet produced offspring of their own. One theory for why immature females tend to seek out infants is that they can prepare for their future roles as mothers. Infant baboons born to first-time mothers suffer higher mortality than those born to experienced mothers, which suggests that prior experience in caring for infants is important. Adult males in the groups also care for the infants, as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> related to them. Males groom infants, reducing the amount of parasites they may have, and calm them when they are stressed. They may also protect them from predators, such as chimpanzees. However, adult males exploit infants and use them to reduce the likelihood that other males will threaten them.|$|E

25|$|The Odysseus crater is now quite {{flat for}} its size of {{approximately}} 450km or more precisely, its floor conforms to Tethys' spherical shape.

In some uncommon scenarios, some sightings have been in colder climates, such as New York, Ohio, and Maine. Typically, the huntsman finds shelter in warehouses, and warm buildings. In southern Africa they are commonly known as rain spiders because of their tendency to seek shelter before rain storms, often entering human habitations when doing so.|$|E
25|$|Although {{physical}} characteristics and sizes at various instars {{have been used}} to estimate fly age, a more recent study has been conducted to determine the age of an egg based on the expression of particular genes. This is particularly useful in determining developmental stages that are not evidenced by change in size; such as the egg or pupa and where only a general time interval can be estimated based on the duration of the particular developmental stage. This is done by breaking the stages down into smaller units separated by predictable changed in gene expression. Three genes were measured in an experiment with Drosophila melanogaster: bicoid (bcd), slalom (sll), and chitin synthase (cs). These three genes were used because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in varied levels during different times of the egg development process. These genes all share a linear relationship in regards to age of the egg; that is, the older the egg is the more of the particular gene is expressed. However, all of the genes are expressed in varying amounts. Different genes on different loci would need to be selected for another fly species. The genes expressions are mapped in a control sample to formulate a developmental chart of the gene expression at certain time intervals. This chart can then be compared to the measured values of gene expression to accurately predict the age of an egg to within two hours with a high confidence level. Even though this technique can be used to estimate the age of an egg, the feasibility and legal acceptance of this must be considered for it to be a widely utilized forensic technique. One benefit of this would be that it is like other DNA-based techniques so most labs would be equipped to conduct similar experiments without requiring new capital investment. This style of age determination {{is in the process of}} being used to more accurately find the age of the instars and pupa; however, it is much more complicated, as there are more genes being expressed during these stages. The hope is that with this and other similar techniques a more accurate PMI can be obtained.|$|E
