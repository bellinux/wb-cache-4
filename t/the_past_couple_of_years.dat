25|$|Ever {{since the}} over-commercialization of hip hop {{occurred}} between the late 1980s and the mid 1990s (at peak), traditional hip hop supporters {{have been in}} a feud with more progressive hip hop fans, claiming that they are uneducated towards what they are building, and that it they are not only building music that steps further and further away from Hip Hop, but causes ignorance and misconceptions between fans of more progressed Hip Hop, and traditional fans of the Hip Hop culture.

25|$|Another {{influential}} {{factor is}} oil revenues. Historically, in periods of {{high oil prices}} and the consequent petrodollar windfall, imports accelerate rapidly in virtually all consumption categories including agricultural products. This, in turn, results in crowding out domestic production and damage to the agriculture sector. After the oil price spikes following 1973, agricultural imports also increased dramatically and caused significant damage to domestic production. Between 1970 and 1976, agricultural imports grew at the staggering annual rate of 35%. This experience was repeated in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> when oil prices were at or over $100 per barrel; {{the result is that}} agricultural imports have increased at a rapid pace and foreign products now form a sizeable chunk of the household consumption basket. Over the past few years, there have been significant price increases in agricultural products in Iran. This is due both to rising domestic demand and to rising global commodity prices.|$|E

500|$|The album's {{influence}} has reached beyond jazz, as musicians of such genres as rock and classical {{have been influenced}} by it, while critics have written about it {{as one of the most}} influential albums of all time. Many improvisatory rock musicians of the 1960s referred to Kind of Blue for inspiration, along with other Davis albums, as well as Coltrane's modal records My Favorite Things (1961) and A Love Supreme (1965). Guitarist Duane Allman of the Allman Brothers Band said his soloing on songs such as [...] "In Memory of Elizabeth Reed" [...] "comes from Miles and Coltrane, and particularly Kind of Blue. I've listened to that album so many times that for <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> I haven't hardly listened to anything else." [...] Pink Floyd keyboardist Richard Wright said that the chord progressions on the album influenced the structure of the introductory chords to the song [...] "Breathe" [...] on their landmark opus The Dark Side of the Moon (1973). In his book Kind of Blue: The Making of a Miles Davis Masterpiece, writer Ashley Kahn wrote [...] "still acknowledged as the height of hip, four decades after it was recorded, Kind of Blue is the premier album of its era, jazz or otherwise. Its vapory piano introduction is universally recognized". [...] Producer Quincy Jones, one of Davis' longtime friends, wrote: [...] "That [...] will always be my music, man. I play Kind of Blue every day—it's my orange juice. It still sounds like it was made yesterday". Pianist Chick Corea, one of Miles' acolytes, was also struck by its majesty, later stating [...] "It's one thing to just play a tune, or play a program of music, but it's another thing to practically create a new language of music, which is what Kind of Blue did." ...|$|E
