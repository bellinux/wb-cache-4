5000|$|On 18 June 1815 the Battle of Waterloo was fought. As the {{battlefield}} {{was close to}} Brussels, and many wounded of all armies were taken to that city, Craan was able to interview many prominent French and Allied wounded officers about their experiences during the battle. On the basis of information gained in this way he published a detailed map of the battle, with an explanatory note in September 1816, under the <b>title</b> <b>Plan</b> du champ de bataille de Waterloo, avec notice historique. In the explanatory note he mentions the names of generals Mouton, Lobau, Excelmans and Gérard on the French side. He also mentions a number of high British, Dutch-Belgian and Prussian officers, though he does not give their names. Colonel François Aimé Mellinet (chief-of-staff of the Young Guard Division) advised him on the map, as did [...] "a number of Prussian generals" [...] to whom he was introduced by Prince Frederick of the Netherlands. The Prince of Orange, who had commanded an army corps at the battle later viewed the map and approved of it (as did the Duke of Wellington). Finally, Emperor Alexander I of Russia was so enamored of the map that he presented Craan with a precious ring.|$|E

30|$|In 2003, {{the federal}} {{government}} of Brazil announced a national plan to title 750, 000 families. The program was designed to issue land titles to families living under illegal conditions (i.e., residents illegally squatting in urban dwellings). According {{to the most recent}} Brazilian annual household survey, about 5 percent of the country’s households, or 10 million people, do not have tenure security (IBGE 2009). This particular land <b>title</b> <b>plan</b> only operates in illegally settled public areas. The main consequence is that new official property owners are fully protected under Brazilian Law. The government does not have any post rights over the land/property after titling execution. Other land dispute cases in Brazil are much more complex given that the invasion occurred on private property, which led to protracted legal battles as describes ANOREG (2007) manual report.|$|E
40|$|The LPI (NSW) is {{implementing}} {{a new system}} of lodgement of digital land title plans in NSW known as E-Plan. The E-Plan program will utilise LandXML files for the electronic submission, processing and registration of land title or survey plans. This will be the first system of plan lodgement Australia wide to use electronic examination from submission through to registration. LandXML was created in 2000 by surveyors and engineers for surveyors and engineers and has been tailored to suit the E-Plan process. LandXML is seen as the new emerging format for the transfer of digital data files between different software environments. The objectives of this dissertation are to identify LandXML files and their origin, to investigate the E-Plan process and to identify the main stakeholders involved in E-Plan. A SWOT analysis will be used to compare the current systems of survey plan lodgement against the new E-Plan process. By doing a pre and post E-Plan analysis it can be shown how the current weaknesses may become strengths and how the current threats to the LPI may be turned into opportunities. The comparison of the two SWOT analyses will also highlight future weaknesses and threats to the LPI upon implementing E-Plan. The main problem with the current systems of land <b>title</b> <b>plan</b> lodgement from submission through to registration is the manual and multiple handling of the survey plans. Currently plans are submitted in hard or paper copy and are a non-intelligent format so that the survey plan examiners cannot easily enquire information on the plan without having to recreate the plan in the digital environment. E-Plan uses LandXML digital data file format that allows the electronic examination through the use of automated rules engines possible thus reducing the need for multiple and manual handling of plans and reducing the cost and timeframe for the registration of survey plans. E-Plan will provide a faster and less costly registration process for surveyors through the use of LandXML files. Through using the pre-validation tool available online surveyors can validate their LandXML prior to submission of the land <b>title</b> <b>plan</b> which will reduce requisition rates thus utilising the resources of the LPI more efficientl...|$|E
