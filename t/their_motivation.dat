Eli attended classes from 1852 to 1854. He also assisted {{at a local}} printing press as a printer's devil. Lilly {{grew up in a}} Methodist household, and his family was prohibitionist and anti-slavery; their beliefs served as part of <b>their</b> <b>motivation</b> for moving to Indiana. Lilly and his family were members of the Democratic Party during his early life, but they became Republicans during the years leading up to the Civil War.|$|E

25|$|As {{children}} {{transition from}} early childhood to middle childhood, <b>their</b> <b>motivation</b> to participate changes. In both the Indigenous communities of Quechua people and Rioja in Peru, children often experience a transition {{in which they}} become more included into their family's and community's endeavors. This changes their position and role in their families to more responsible ones and leads {{to an increase in}} their eagerness to participate and belong. As children go through this transition, they often develop a sense of identity within their family and community.|$|E

25|$|Learners should {{constantly}} {{be challenged}} with tasks that refer to {{skills and knowledge}} just beyond their current level of mastery.

25|$|In the {{experimental}} setting, {{researchers have also}} tested compensatory control in regard to individuals’ perceptions of external systems, such as religion or government. For example, Kay and colleagues found that in a laboratory setting, individuals {{are more likely to}} endorse broad external systems (e.g., religion or sociopolitical systems) that impose order and control on their lives when they are induced with lowered levels of personal control. In this study, researchers suggest that when a person’s personal control is lessened, <b>their</b> <b>motivation</b> to believe in order is threatened, resulting in compensation of this threat through adherence to other external sources of control.|$|E
25|$|According {{to a study}} {{published}} in 2002 students are interested in the Swedish language, and find it an important part of education, but they perceived Swedish being compulsory lessened <b>their</b> <b>motivation</b> (this argument has been made very frequently in the public debate). The experiment of making the Swedish test voluntary in the matriculation examination (the completion of which is a de facto requirement for university enrollment) was declared successful and was made permanent. The percentage of students taking the Swedish test has since been constantly dropping and was 67% in 2009 (less than 50% of boys).|$|E

25|$|Research by Sobh and Martin (2011) {{suggests}} that people buy anti-aging products {{to obtain a}} hoped-for self (e.g., keeping a youthful skin) or to avoid a feared-self (e.g., looking old). The research shows that when consumers pursue a hoped-for self, it is expectations of success that most strongly drive <b>their</b> <b>motivation</b> to use the product. The research also shows why doing badly when trying to avoid a feared self is more motivating than doing well. Interestingly, when product use is seen to fail it is more motivating than success when consumers seek to avoid a feared-self.|$|E
25|$|Assessment of the NVA/PAVN fighter. Compared {{to their}} VC {{counterparts}} most NVA {{had a higher}} standard of literacy. While his preparation was not especially impressive by Western standards, the typical NVA soldier proved more than adequate for the task at hand. NVA training was surprisingly conventional, with little special emphasis on jungle warfare. Most of the troops' learning occurred on the job. Service and indoctrination under the communist system prior to army recruitment made the typical NVA fighter a bit older and more seasoned than his American or ARVN opponent. Throughout the conflict, NVA defections and surrenders were extremely low, especially compared to that of the VC, a testimony to <b>their</b> <b>motivation</b> and organization.|$|E
25|$|The series {{continued}} with Scream 2, premiering at Mann's Chinese Theater, followed by general release in December 1997, again written by Williamson {{and directed by}} Craven, released {{less than a year}} after the original film. Like Scream, the film features characters aware of the horror genre and the conventions of the horror sequel, mocking them while simultaneously falling victim to them. The film again focuses on the character of Sidney Prescott, now a college student, as a series of copycat crimes begin, the killers again using the disguise of Ghostface. The film was financially successful, deviating from its predecessor's worldwide gross by less than US$1 million and receiving similar critical praise for its deconstruction of the horror film sequel and commentary on the influence of the media in society. The script for Scream 2 was leaked during production revealing the identity of the killers and so the film underwent extensive rewrites, changing the identity of the killers though <b>their</b> <b>motivation</b> remained intact.|$|E

25|$|Each New Girl episode {{starts out}} as a pitch page, goes through stages of an outline and a final draft before being filmed and edited, a process which may take weeks. Each stage is {{approved}} by Meriwether and her co-showrunners, by the production company Chernin, the Fox studio and the Fox network. One group of writers works on alternate punchlines ("alts"), while another group rebreaks a draft until they find the funniest and most emotionally resonant version. All characters are tried to be tied into the story, and determining <b>their</b> <b>motivation</b> is the major goal so that people will laugh. Before taking the script to the table read with the whole cast on Tuesday, the main writers of an episode continue working on the draft {{over the weekend and}} the executive producers polish it. During the first season, Meriwether usually made a final pass at the draft alone because of her film and theater background. The actors' performance influences new story ideas; the actors may also hand in story ideas.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{activity}} is body movement that works your muscles and requires {{more energy than}} resting. According to a blog by the American Intercontinental University, college students should make time for exercise to maintain and increase motivation. AIU states that regular exercise has impeccable effects on the brain. With consistent running routines, there are more complex connections between neurons, meaning the brain is able to access its brain cells more flexibly. By performing well physically, motivation will be present in education because of how well the brain is performing. After exercising, the brain can have more desire to obtain knowledge and better retain the information. In addition, exercise can relieve stress. Exercising can ease anxiety and relieve negative effects of stress on the body. Without stress factors, individuals can perform better and more efficiently, since their minds will have a more positive outlook. This positive mood will help keep students motivated and more open and willing to succeed academically. Lastly, exercise increases focus and concentration that could also help students maintain <b>their</b> <b>motivation</b> and focus on their studies. AIU claims that exercise may have improved the students' ability to participate and retain information during the class after they had exercised. Being able to retain information and being willing to participate keeps students motivated and performing well academically.|$|E

500|$|On March 13, 2012, two {{separate}} parties were attempted in Miramar, Florida and Houston, Texas.

Police claimed to have turned away 2,000 teenagers who approached the property unaware of the party's cancellation. In Houston, 13 teenagers were arrested after successfully throwing a party and causing up to $100,000 of damage to an empty home. When police questioned the teens about <b>their</b> <b>motivation,</b> they claimed to have been inspired by the film. A second Houston party attracted between 500 and 1,000 guests, but resulted in the death of one person after an attendee started firing a gun when police attempted to break up the event.|$|E
500|$|By March 1849 these {{negative}} feelings {{led to the}} GPK Chairman, James McCall being removed along with several directors; Andrew Orr took over as chairman, but for a period the remaining directors from the earlier years formed an obstructive group; <b>their</b> <b>motivation</b> {{seemed to be the}} personal liabilities they had taken on on behalf of the company, and their wish to be indemnified against personal loss. Orr eventually resolved these issues and on 24 August, Orr held shareholders' meetings of each company (separately) and announced that all the [...] "old" [...] directors had resigned, and that a new board would shortly be formed, with an identical composition for the two companies. The engineer John Miller also resigned at this time in the interest of economy.

[...] Likewise Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York bestowed 3 of 5 stars, saying, [...] "Black has massively upped the verbal sparring and kept the broad inventiveness of comic-book malleability in mind. ... The most wonderful of Black's surprises harkens back to his '80s reputation for character revision and is simply too good to ruin here." [...] But, he asked, [...] "hy, finally, are we down at the docks—in the dark, no less—for one of those lumbering climaxes involving swinging shipping cranes? The energy bleeds out of the film; it's as if the producers were scared the crowd would riot over not enough digital fakeness." ...|$|E
