25|$|Because {{dark matter}} {{remains to be}} {{conclusively}} identified, many theories that aim to explain the observational evidence without invoking dark matter have emerged. The obvious way <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> modify general relativity. General relativity is well-tested on solar-system scales, but its validity on galactic or cosmological scales is less certain. A suitable modification to general relativity can conceivably {{eliminate the need for}} dark matter. The most well-known theories of this class are MOND and its relativistic generalization TeVeS, f(R) gravity and entropic gravity. Alternative theories abound.|$|E

25|$|Further {{reduction}} is possible by using multiple coating layers, designed such that reflections from the surfaces undergo maximal destructive interference. One way <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> add a second quarter-wave thick higher-index layer between the low-index layer and the substrate. The reflection {{from all three}} interfaces produces destructive interference and anti-reflection. Other techniques use varying thicknesses of the coatings. By using two or more layers, each of a material chosen to give the best possible match of the desired refractive index and dispersion, broadband anti-reflection coatings covering the visible range (400–700nm) with maximal reflectivities of less than 0.5% are commonly achievable.|$|E
25|$|With the Authority {{beginning}} to forcefully expand {{its influence on}} the wasteland settlements, the Resistance is forced to act {{with the help of}} Raine who is able to recover data that shows the location of every Ark on the planet. Captain Marshall plans to use this data to activate all the Arks and form an army that can defeat the Authority, but the only way <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> transmit the data from Capital Prime, the main headquarters for the Authority. Alone, Raine fights his way through Capital Prime to transmit the Ark activation code, and the game concludes with all of the remaining Arks simultaneously becoming active and surfacing.|$|E
25|$|When {{dealing with}} tons of water, {{it has to}} be {{distributed}} evenly and slowly. Occasionally main channels will need maintenance, or may be damaged due to external reasons. In order to even assess the problem, tons of water need to be removed from the main channel. The best way <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> slow the overall flow from the main dam and redirect all water flowing originally through the damaged channel to backup channels. Radial gates serve this purpose, they regulate the flow of water. It is imperative to keep water flowing. Lack of the flow will not only compromise all irrigation linked to that channel but also all cities linked will experience a power outage.|$|E

25|$|Applying a pinch {{current in}} a plasma {{can be used}} to {{counteract}} expansion and confine the plasma. A simple way <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> put the plasma in a linear tube and pass a current through it using electrodes at either end, like a fluorescent lamp. This arrangement still produces no confinement {{along the length of the}} tube, so the plasma flows onto the electrodes, rapidly eroding them. This is not a problem for a purely experimental machine, and there are ways to reduce the rate. Another solution is to place a magnet next to the tube; when the magnetic field changes, the fluctuations cause an electric current to be induced in the plasma. The major advantage of this arrangement is that there are no physical objects within the tube, so it can be formed into a torus and allow the plasma to circulate freely.|$|E

500|$|The basic {{feature of}} every finite group is its {{multiplication}} table, also called Cayley table, that records {{the result of}} multiplying any two elements. A representation of a group {{can be thought of}} new set of elements, finite-dimensional or infinite-dimensional matrices, giving the same multiplication table after mapping the old elements to the new elements in a one-to-one fashion. The same holds true {{in the case of an}} infinite group like the rotation group SO(3) or the Lorentz group. The multiplication table is just harder to visualize in the case of a group of uncountable size (same size as the set of reals). One way <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> wellorder the elements of the group with an ordinal number [...] being the order type. The [...] "infinite Cayley table" [...] is then indexed by two ordinals [...] written on Cantor normal form.|$|E

500|$|In {{the second}} instance, {{breaking}} the scheme {{is even more}} straightforward. Since {{there are only a}} limited number of possible shifts (26 in English), they can each be tested in turn in a brute force attack. One way <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> write out a snippet of the ciphertext in a table of all possible shifts – a technique sometimes known as [...] "completing the plain component". The example given is for the ciphertext [...] "EXXEGOEXSRGI"; the plaintext is instantly recognisable by eye at a shift of four. Another way of viewing this method is that, under each letter of the ciphertext, the entire alphabet is written out in reverse starting at that letter. This attack can be accelerated using a set of strips prepared with the alphabet written down in reverse order. The strips are then aligned to form the ciphertext along one row, and the plaintext should appear in one of the other rows.|$|E

I lavished him with books by Gerald Durrell and David Attenborough and Jane Goodall, and any book I could find on the animal kingdom, no expense spared.
