5|$|The {{principal}} damage {{sustained by}} aircraft flying into a {{volcanic ash cloud}} is abrasion to forward-facing surfaces, such as <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>and</b> leading edges of the wings, and accumulation of ash into surface openings, including engines. Abrasion of windshields and landing lights will reduce visibility forcing pilots to rely on their instruments. However, some instruments may provide incorrect readings as sensors (e.g., pitot tubes) can become blocked with ash. Ingestion of ash into engines causes abrasion damage to compressor fan blades. The ash erodes sharp blades in the compressor, reducing its efficiency. The ash melts in the combustion chamber to form molten glass. The ash then solidifies on turbine blades, blocking air flow and causing the engine to stall.|$|E
5|$|On McGovern's December 15 mission over Linz, {{his second}} as pilot, {{a piece of}} {{shrapnel}} from flak came through <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>and</b> missed fatally wounding him by only a few inches. The following day {{on a mission to}} Brüx, he nearly collided with another bomber during close-formation flying in complete cloud cover. The following day, he was recommended for a medal after surviving a blown wheel on the always-dangerous B-24 take-off, completing a mission over Germany, and then landing without further damage to the plane. On a December 20 mission against the Škoda Works at Pilsen, Czechoslovakia, McGovern's plane had one engine out and another in flames after being hit by flak. Unable to return to Italy, McGovern flew to a British airfield on Vis, a small island in the Adriatic Sea off the Yugoslav coast that was controlled by Josip Broz Tito's Partisans. The short field, normally used by small fighter planes, was so unforgiving to four-engined aircraft that many of the bomber crews who tried to make emergency landings there perished. But McGovern successfully landed, saving his crew, a feat for which he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} {{collisions}} between motor vehicles and moose is increasing in many countries. Collisions with large, high {{animals such as}} moose cause typical rear- and downward deformation of <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> pillars <b>and</b> front roof, most pronounced for small passenger cars; the injury risk increases with the deformation of the car. A strengthening of <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> pillars <b>and</b> front roof {{and the use of}} antilacerative <b>windshields</b> would reduce <b>the</b> injury risk to car occupants...|$|R
25|$|The {{interior}} was also completely redesigned in 1999. The redesign allowed for larger rear doors, and more space for rear passengers. Controls for various items like headlights, heated seats, and rear wiper {{were moved to}} more convenient locations. The electronic Vehicle Information center was moved from below the radio to above <b>the</b> <b>windshield,</b> <b>and</b> was standard on all 2000 and up models. Limited models included automatic dual-zone climate control. A 10 CD-Changer was also available with the Infinity Audio package.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, President Chen was re-elected to {{a second}} {{four-year}} term after an assassination attempt which occurred {{the day before the}} election. Two shots were fired, one bullet grazing the President's belly after penetrating the windshield of a jeep and several layers of clothing, the other bullet penetrated <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>and</b> hitting the vice president's knee cast (She was wearing a knee cast due to an earlier injury). Police investigators have said that the most likely suspect {{is believed to have been}} Chen Yi-hsiung, who was later found dead. Their injuries were not life-threatening, but the incident is believed by Pan-Blue to have gained them enough sympathy to influence the result.|$|E
25|$|There {{were three}} Imperial models in this generation. The C-14 was the {{standard}} eight and looked {{much like the}} Chrysler Royal C-18 with a longer hood and cowl. The C-15 was the Imperial Custom and the Town Sedan Limousine, with blind rear quarter panels. This model was available by special order. The third model, C-17, was the designation for the Airflow model. They had a concealed crank for raising <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>and</b> the hood was hinged at the cowl and opened from the front; side hood panels were released by catches on the inside. An Imperial Custom convertible sedan {{was used as an}} official car at the Indy 500. The car pictured is James G Martin's (retired airline mechanic) 1939 C-24 7 passenger limousine, believed by him and his son Tim to be the only 1939 production 7-passenger limo still on the road.|$|E

25|$|After {{leaving the}} World Wrestling Federation, the Bulldogs {{returned}} to Stampede Wrestling, {{and also to}} All Japan Pro Wrestling. Stampede officials were hopeful that {{the return of the}} Bulldogs would revive a struggling promotion, but they were unsuccessful. Eventually in May 1989, {{the decision was made to}} split up the Bulldogs, which caused some problems with All Japan owner Shohei Baba, who was still promoting the Bulldogs as a tag team. On 4 July 1989 Smith, along with fellow wrestlers Chris Benoit, Ross Hart, and Jason the Terrible, was involved in a serious automobile accident. Smith, who was not wearing a seatbelt at the time, needed 135 stitches after slamming his head through <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>and</b> being thrown 25 feet onto the pavement. He recovered, and the Bulldogs continued teaming in All Japan against teams such as Joe and Dean Malenko, Kenta Kobashi and Tsuyoshi Kikuchi, and The Nasty Boys. Personal problems began to surface between Smith and Billington, and Smith later left All Japan to return to the WWF.|$|E
500|$|The {{vehicle was}} {{operated}} by a crew of six. Maximum armor was only 0.5inch at <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>and</b> 0.25inches everywhere else. The armament consisted of one 105mm M2A1 howitzer (equipped with eight rounds of ammunition) with a single [...]50 caliber (12.7mm) M2 Browning machine gun (equipped with 300 rounds of ammunition) for local defense.|$|E
500|$|Analysis of {{the cockpit}} area found there was bird residue and {{feathers}} on <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>and</b> center post. The remains of 15cowbirds were found within [...] {{of the end of}} Runway 20L. These birds, the NTSB found, had collided with the aircraft structure. Examination of the two engines found evidence of foreign objects, which consisted of minute fragments of feathers. The objects had blocked cooling ports, and had damaged the rotor assembly inside the engine. It was found the left engine had encountered 14 separate bird strikes and the right engine had encountered five. When the birds entered the engine, they caused the compressors to stall; these were the two loud bangs the witnesses heard as the aircraft took off. As the aircraft passed over the perimeter fence, the left engine flamed out, and the trail of smoke was unburned fuel passing through the hot combustion and turbine sections. Investigators determined it was possible the flight crew had managed to restart the left engine.|$|E

500|$|The {{production}} team used new technology called a [...] "breakway windshield," [...] {{as well as}} air cannons to eject the stuntwoman, Melissa Stubbs, from the vehicle. Instead of using wires, they used pneumatic rams to push her; cables and pulleys made it similar to a [...] "catapult". The stuntwoman rehearsed with a helmet on, but took it off when the scene {{was ready to be}} shot. She wore a small backpad, a mouthguard, and some kneepads, and used her elbows to break the windshield upon being ejected. Stubbs commented that shooting the scene [...] "all went as planned, and was very anticlimactic" [...] {{because of the lack of}} problems. Anna Torv later called the stunt [...] "one of the most humbling experiences in my life". She elaborated, [...] "I don’t do any of the stuff that’s dangerous... Melissa Stubbs is the fantastic stuntwoman who did that [...] They put a rocket for her in the back of the car, and they had that breakaway glass for the windshield. She has nothing on extra, except maybe elbow pads. Then they shoot her out of this rocket, through <b>the</b> <b>windshield,</b> <b>and</b> she rolls on the ground and lands on her mark. The guy goes in. She's OK. Everybody claps. Then I have to go in, lay in the same position, so they can get a close-up of my eyes opening. That was kind of humbling." ...|$|E
2500|$|Borealis I {{featured}} a major redesign from the tried-and-true cutout car. Instead {{of a flat}} shell with a [...] "bubble" [...] canopy, the team used an innovative [...] "manta" [...] shell design, where <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>and</b> canopy are integrated {{into the body of}} the car. Also, nearly all other systems were redesigned for higher performance.|$|E
2500|$|Concealed {{windshield}} wipers, which {{presented a}} cleaner appearance hidden below the rear {{edge of the}} hood, were standard on the GTO and other 1968 GM products after having been originally introduced on the 1967 Pontiac Grand Prix. [...] A popular option, actually introduced during the 1967 model year, was a hood-mounted tachometer, located in front of <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>and</b> lit for visibility at night. An in-dash tachometer was also available.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>windshield</b> is {{wrap-around}} <b>and</b> {{very deep}} and steeply inclined for the era, while the A-pillar {{has a much}} more vertical angle, providing excellent driver visibility.|$|R
50|$|In late 2007, OPS {{purchased}} {{a small group}} of on wheels equipped with Ford's Street Appearance Package, making the cars look more like civilian Crown Victorias. The vehicles are recognizable, however, by its police wheel covers and LED strips at the top of <b>the</b> front <b>windshield</b> <b>and</b> rear window.|$|R
50|$|In transport, driver {{visibility}} is {{the maximum}} distance {{at which the}} driver of a vehicle can see and identify prominent objects around the vehicle. Visibility is primarily determined by weather conditions (see visibility) and by a vehicle's design. The parts of a vehicle that influence visibility include <b>the</b> <b>windshield,</b> <b>the</b> dashboard <b>and</b> the pillars. Good driver visibility is essential to safe road traffic.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to influencing the lift, the icing covered <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>and</b> the radio antenna, causing radio communication to be cut. The pilot was therefore {{not able to}} navigate properly and {{was not aware of}} that he was flying over the mountain. The aircraft hit the mountain of Hummelfjell at 09:50—at an altitude of —in the municipality of Tolga. The aircraft had a speed of [...] at the time of impact, hitting the ground with the tail first. The engines broke off and the aircraft slid along the snow dune. The aircraft bounced once before settling in a snow dune, which severely limited the impact and presumably saved the lives of many of the passengers.|$|E
2500|$|The Yak-200 {{prototype}} {{made its}} first flight on 10 April 1953 and it underwent its State acceptance trials between 29 July and 10 September. These revealed {{a number of problems}} including poor handling, insufficient longitudinal stability and significant changes in trim as engine power was changed. Other problems included the lack of anti-icing devices for <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>and</b> the propeller blades. Remedies included adding a [...] extension in the fuselage and a dorsal fillet to correct the stability issues. The wings were raised by [...] and their dihedral was reduced. These changes moved the aircraft's center of gravity forward and it became simple and pleasant to fly, even though its empty weight increased by [...] and its gross weight by [...] which did include some additional fuel.|$|E
2500|$|The targa top Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport {{version of}} the Bugatti Veyron EB 16.4 was {{unveiled}} at the 2008 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. It has extensive reinforcements {{to compensate for the}} lack of a standard roof, and small changes to <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>and</b> running lights. Two removable tops are included, the second a temporary arrangement fashioned after an umbrella. The top speed with the hardtop in place {{is the same as the}} standard coupé version, but with the roof down is limited to —and to [...] with the temporary soft roof. [...] The Grand Sport edition was limited to 150 units, with the first 50 going exclusively to registered Bugatti customers. Production began in the second quarter of 2009, with the car priced at [...] (excluding taxes and delivery).|$|E

50|$|The first Choro-Q {{cars were}} more geared toward children, with primary colors and low detail. They {{have grown more}} {{sophisticated}} over time and now {{are for the most}} part cast in a uniform clear, colored or smoked resin plastic which is then painted, thus leaving <b>the</b> <b>windshields</b> <b>and</b> headlights, etc. transparent for added realism. From early on, Takara offered accessories and various spare parts and modification parts, including different motors to give a higher speed. Recently the newer Choro-Q are sold from the factory with various styles of spring-wound motors, including slow (for trucks and machinery), normal (for normal cars), and fast (for sports cars). There is even a 2-speed motor that starts out slow and then shifts to a higher gear.|$|R
2500|$|The XV40 was {{redesigned}} {{to incorporate}} a [...] longer wheelbase, wider wheel tracks, and a stiffer body. Although overall length {{is equal to}} its predecessor, Toyota maximized interior volume—especially fore-and-aft space. This was achieved by moving the base of <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>and</b> rear glass outwards and by the redesigning of the front seats. At , cargo space has been reduced by [...] over the previous model. The SE/Sportivo provides [...] due to the placement of bracing behind the rear seat, with the hybrid version falling to [...] due to {{the placement of the}} battery pack. The XV40's underbody is stepped, creating a venturi effect and hence a low-pressure area under the front end to increase downforce. Other aerodynamic design features include a stepped engine undercover and rear wheel fairings to channel airflow around the tires. The coefficient of drag figure remains at 0.28, falling to 0.27 for the hybrid version (which makes it the most aerodynamic car built in Australia).|$|E
2500|$|Needing a new {{car because}} of the high profile of Ward's Packard, they found {{traveling}} salesman Merle Collison sleeping in his Buick along the highway outside Douglas, Wyoming. After Collison was awakened, he was shot. Starkweather later accused Fugate of performing a coup-de-grace after his shotgun jammed. Starkweather claimed Fugate was the [...] "most trigger happy person" [...] he had ever met. The salesman's car had a push-pedal emergency brake, which was something new to Starkweather. While attempting to drive away, the car stalled. He tried to restart the engine and a passing motorist stopped to help. Starkweather threatened him with the rifle, and an altercation ensued. At that moment, a deputy sheriff arrived on the scene. Fugate ran to him, yelling something to the effect of: [...] "It's Starkweather! He's going to kill me!" [...] Starkweather tried to evade the police, exceeding speeds of [...] A bullet shattered <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>and</b> flying glass cut Starkweather deep enough to cause bleeding. He then stopped and surrendered. Converse County Sheriff Earl Heflin said, [...] "He thought he was bleeding to death. That's why he stopped. That's the kind of yellow son of a bitch he is." ...|$|E
2500|$|President Chen and Vice President Lu were {{standing}} {{in the back seat of}} an open convertible Jeep moving slowly through a crowded street when around 1:45 PM, a bullet penetrated the windshield of the vehicle, grazed Chen's stomach, and was stopped in his clothes. Chen received a flesh wound [...] long and [...] wide. The other bullet penetrated <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>and</b> hit a cast on Lu's knee which she was wearing due to an earlier injury and was later found in the vehicle. At first both believed that they had been hit by firecrackers, which are common in Taiwanese political parades and rallies. Chen realized that it was something more serious when he noticed that he was bleeding from the abdomen and that there was a bullet hole in the window. Chen reported pain in his abdomen and Lu reported pain in her knee and they were taken to the Chi-Mei Hospital. At 3:30 pm, the spokesperson for the president, Chiou I-jen, announced that the [...] "National Security Mechanism" [...] had been activated. By 5:30 pm, both the Pan-Blue and Pan-Green coalitions announced that they would cease all scheduled campaigning activities.|$|E
500|$|As was {{traditional}} with Ilyushin's ground-attack aircraft the Il-20 used a load-bearing armored shell {{to protect}} the pilot and gunner {{as well as the}} engine, fuel, lubrication and cooling systems.
