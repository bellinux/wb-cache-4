5|$|The {{systemic}} {{heart has}} muscular contractile walls {{and consists of}} a single ventricle and two atria, one for {{each side of the}} body. <b>The</b> <b>blood</b> vessels consist of arteries, capillaries and veins and are lined with a cellular endothelium which is quite unlike that of most other invertebrates. <b>The</b> <b>blood</b> circulates through the aorta and capillary system, to the vena cavae, after which <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> is pumped through the gills by the auxiliary hearts and back to the main heart.

5|$|A {{blood vessel}} leads {{up the middle}} of the body from the stomach to a {{circular}} vessel {{at the base of the}} lophophore, and from there a single blind vessel runs up each tentacle. A pair of blood vessels near the body wall lead downward from the lophophore ring to the stomach and also to blind branches throughout the body.

5|$|A special but unusual {{consideration}} is cardiogenic shock, where <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> pressure is decreased {{not due to}} dehydration but due to inability of the heart to pump blood through <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> vessels.

5|$|Chemicals {{released}} by macrophages can also damage host tissue. TNF-α {{is an important}} chemical that is {{released by}} macrophages that causes <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> in small vessels to clot to prevent an infection from spreading. However, if a bacterial infection spreads to <b>the</b> <b>blood,</b> TNF-α is released into vital organs, which can cause vasodilation {{and a decrease in}} plasma volume; these in turn can be followed by septic shock. During septic shock, TNF-α release causes a blockage of the small vessels that supply blood to the vital organs, and the organs may fail. Septic shock can lead to death.|$|E
5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is a clinical diagnosis, i.e., no diagnostic test conclusively proves its presence or absence, but direct {{measurement of the}} pressure in a fascial compartment, {{and the difference between}} this pressure and <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> pressure, may be used to assess its severity.

5|$|Dissection {{occurs when}} blood accumulates {{in the wall}} of <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> vessel.

Various theories exist as to whether people who sustain carotid and vertebral artery dissection, even if not suffering from a connective tissue disorder, have an underlying vulnerability. Biopsy samples of skin and other arteries has indicated {{that this might be}} a possibility, but no genetic defect in collagen or elastin genes has been convincingly proven.

2500|$|The primary rival of the Crips is <b>the</b> <b>Bloods</b> street-gang. <b>The</b> rivalry {{dates back}} to the 1960s when Raymond Washington and several other Crips confronted Sylvester Scott and Benson Owens, {{students}} at Centennial High School. In response to the attack, Scott, who lived in Compton, established the Piru street-gang, the first [...] "Bloods" [...] street gang. Owens established the West Piru street-gang. <b>The</b> <b>Bloods</b> street-gang was initially formed to provide members protection from the Crips. In late 1972, several gangs that felt victimized by the Crips due to their escalating attacks joined the Piru Street Boys to create a new federation of non-Crip gangs which would later become known as Bloods.
