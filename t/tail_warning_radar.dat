5|$|Some of the ECM {{equipment}} which initially saw {{use on the}} Victor, such as {{the original}} chaff dispenser and Orange Putter <b>tail</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radar,</b> had been developed for the earlier English Electric Canberra bomber and were already considered to be near-obsolete {{by the time the}} Victor had entered service. Significant improvements and alterations would be made to the avionics and ECM suites, as effective ECMs had been deemed critical to the Victor's role; for example, the introduction of the more capable Red Steer <b>tail</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radar.</b> The introduction of the Victor B.2 was accompanied by several new ECM systems, including a passive radar warning receiver, a metric radar jammer and communications jamming equipment. Streamlined fairings on the trailing edges of the wings that could house large quantities of defensive chaff/flares were also new additions. While trials were conducted with terrain-following radar and a side scan mode for the bombing and navigation radar, neither of these functions were integrated into the operational fleet.|$|E
5|$|Production B.1 Victors were {{powered by}} the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire ASSa.7 {{turbojets}} rated at , and was initially deployed with the Blue Danube nuclear weapon, re-deploying with the more powerful Yellow Sun weapon when it became available. Victors also carried U.S.-owned Mark 5 nuclear bombs (made available under the Project E programme) and the British Red Beard tactical nuclear weapon. A total of 24 were upgraded to B.1A standard {{by the addition of}} Red Steer <b>tail</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radar</b> in an enlarged tail-cone and a suite of radar warning receivers and electronic countermeasures (ECM) from 1958 to 1960.|$|E
5|$|Tests were {{conducted}} with a frequency modulated type radar altimeter known as AYD and a pulse type known as 718. The AYD modifications {{were made by the}} Norden Laboratories Corporation under an OSRD contract. When the manufacturer of 718, RCA, was contacted, it was learned that a new <b>tail</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radar,</b> AN/APS-13, later nicknamed Archie, was just entering production, which could be adapted for use as a radar altimeter. The third unit to be made was delivered to Los Alamos in April 1944. In May it was tested by diving an AT-11. This was followed by full-scale drop testing in June and July. These were very successful, whereas the AYD continued to suffer from problems. Archie was therefore adopted, although the scarcity of units in August 1944 precluded wholescale destructive testing. Testing of Silverplate Boeing B-29 Superfortress aircraft with Thin Man bomb shapes was carried out at Muroc Army Air Field in March and June 1944.|$|E
5|$|By this point, {{supplies}} of the Beaufighter {{and the new}} Mosquito had improved dramatically, and {{the decision was made}} to remove all single-engine designs from the night fighter force during 1942. Two Defiant units did switch to the Mk. VI, but they operated for only about four months before converting to the Mosquito. Production for the AI role ended, and the electronics were converted to Monica <b>tail</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radars</b> for the bomber force, until the mid-1944 knowledge of the Germans' Flensburg radar detector, which spotted Monica transmissions, was revealed to the British.|$|R
500|$|Two or more {{redundant}} radar altimeters {{were used}} to reliably detect final altitude. When the altimeters sensed the correct height, the firing switch closed, igniting the three BuOrd Mk15, Mod 1 Navy gun primers in the breech plug, which set off the charge consisting of four silk powder bags each containing two pounds of WM slotted-tube cordite. This launched the uranium projectile towards {{the opposite end of}} the gun barrel at an eventual muzzle velocity of [...] Approximately 10 milliseconds later the chain reaction occurred, lasting less than 1 microsecond. The radar altimeters used were modified U.S. Army Air Corps APS-13 <b>tail</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radars,</b> nicknamed [...] "Archie", normally used to warn a fighter pilot of another plane approaching from behind.|$|R

25|$|As a night fighter {{that was}} not {{expected}} to be as fast as smaller daylight fighters, the expectation was to have a stable platform for its radar system and the four 20mm cannon mounted in the lower fuselage. The F3D was, however, able to outturn a MiG-15. The fire control system in the F3D-1 was the Westinghouse AN/APQ-35. The AN/APQ-35 was advanced for the time, a combination of three different radars, each performing separate functions: an AN/APS-21 search radar, an AN/APG-26 tracking radar, both located in the nose, and an AN/APS-28 <b>tail</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radar.</b> The complexity of this vacuum tube-based radar system, which was produced before the advent of semiconductor electronics, required intensive maintenance to keep it operating properly.|$|E

500|$|Dnestr radar (...) and Dnepr radar (...) , both {{known by}} the NATO {{reporting}} name Hen House are {{the first generation of}} Soviet space surveillance and early <b>warning</b> <b>radars.</b> Six radars of this type were built around the periphery of the Soviet Union starting in the 1960s to provide ballistic missile warnings for attacks from different directions. They were the primary Soviet early <b>warning</b> <b>radars</b> for much of the later Cold War. In common with other Soviet and Russian early <b>warning</b> <b>radars</b> they are named after rivers, the Dnestr and the Dnepr.|$|R

500|$|Normally, {{bombs are}} cheap and fuses are {{relatively}} expensive, but {{an atomic bomb}} is extremely expensive, and any failure of a triggering device is unacceptable. On the other hand, for the same reason, fuses can be employed that would be prohibitively expensive in a conventional bomb. Brode's E-3 group were tasked to develop a fusing mechanism that would have less than one chance in 10,000 of failing to detonate within [...] of the required height. The required height was not initially known, as it depended on the yield, which was uncertain. The group investigated both radar proximity fuses and barometric altimeter fuses. Testing was carried out at the Naval Proving Ground in Dahlgren, Virginia in August 1943 and Muroc Army Air Field in March 1944 using dummy drops from barrage balloons. In the end, a modified APS-13 Monica <b>tail</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radar</b> known as [...] "Archie" [...] was employed, and the fuses performed flawlessly in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} {{to proceed with}} the B.2 versions of the Vulcan was made in May 1956. It was anticipated that the first B.2 would be around the 45th aircraft of the 99 then on order. As well as being able to achieve greater heights over targets, it was believed that operational flexibility could be extended by the provision of in-flight refuelling equipment and tanker aircraft. The increasing sophistication of Soviet air defences required the fitting of electronic countermeasure (ECM) equipment and vulnerability could be reduced by the introduction of the Avro Blue Steel stand-off missile, then in development. In order to develop these proposals, the second Vulcan prototype VX777 was rebuilt with the larger and thinner phase 2C wing, improved flying control surfaces and Olympus 102 engines, first flying in this configuration in August 1957. Plans were in hand to equip all Vulcans from the 16th aircraft onwards with in-flight refuelling receiving equipment. A B.1, XA903, was allocated for Blue Steel development work. [...] Other B.1s were used {{for the development of the}} BOl.6 (later Olympus 200), XA891; a new AC electrical system, XA893; and ECM including jammers within a bulged tail-cone and a <b>tail</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radar,</b> XA895.|$|E
2500|$|The German {{response}} was {{to increase the efficiency}} of overland plotting systems. The German Observer Corps was essential to this move initially until the introduction of the Wassermann and Mammuth long-range radar became available in large quantities and plotting became centralized and simplified. The Germans also used intercept stations to listen to and track the IFF devices when they were switched on in British bombers over German-held territory. When Bomber Command issued orders to keep these turned off the Germans tracked [...] "Monica" [...] <b>tail</b> <b>warning</b> <b>radar</b> and H2S navigation radar transmissions from British bombers. H2S was tracked by Naxos radar detectors while Monica was tracked on Flensburg radar detectors, both mounted on night fighters. The British refused to believe tracking H2S transmissions was possible, despite Ultra reports identifying these new radar systems and calculating that they were responsible for 210 of the 494 bombers (42 percent) lost over Germany in January to February 1944.|$|E
