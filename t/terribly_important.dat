[...] Critic Collen McDannel has pointed out that, particularly in regard to his treatment of religion, Dick's work is different from most of the FSA file. [...] Because of his composition of images of the poor surrounded by religious items and by ordinary household objects (objects not in themselves indicating poverty), Dick's photographs are less politically clear than those of the other FSA photographers.

The current debate centres on the following six questions: (1) What is the source of jus cogens obligations? (2) What is the role of consent in the creation and modification of jus cogens norms? (3) How do we identify norms belonging to this category? (4) What does the category comprise? Are there such things, for example, as regional jus cogens or jus cogens principles? Are jus cogens rules necessarily rules of conduct? (5) What are the function and effects of the international jus cogens regime? (6) What is the function of jus cogens in international legal discourse? Overall, the intense scholarly debate had on peremptory international law over the last ten to twenty years has not been <b>terribly</b> productive. One <b>important</b> reason for this would seem to be the general failure of discussants to fully understand the relevance of some basic assumptions that they bring to bear on their respective analysis and consideration of the topic. To facilitate future constructive debate, this essay aims to clarify the relevance for any thoughtful consideration of jus cogens issues of legal positivism and legal idealism. While legal positivism and legal idealism are sets of theories offered to explain the concept of law, {{it is not surprising that}} lawyers of different camps will have different answers to questions (1) and (2). As argued in this essay, however, the influence of different theoretical approaches to the concept of law goes further than this - it permeates the entire jus cogens debate. Consequently, depending on whether lawyers take the position of a legal positivist or a legal idealist, they will be inclined to answer differently all questions (1) -(6) ...|$|R

2500|$|He {{explained}} his particular ethos {{and style of}} management of CSIRO in this way: Well, I suppose I always wanted to extrapolate from my own experience, small-scale experience, and some personal opinions. I had a strong desire always to see pure and applied research undertaken {{side by side in}} the same laboratory.... And I was still very much aware that the recognition that many – most, I should say – of the really important and fundamental discoveries in science which subsequently led to a massive technological development have come through curiosity-led research, and often through serendipity, which is <b>terribly</b> <b>important.</b> I think the Birch report was very helpful, and I agreed with his report that the whole core of the policy-making in the science that we were going to carry out was a matter of defining the right proportion of, shall we say, pure research, strategic mission-oriented, and technical research – and getting that proportion right.... I felt that fundamental research in the end was going to reap the real benefits in the long run ... discovering something like electricity ... was absolutely fundamental research and had an enormous impact on the world. On the other hand, there was the awareness that you're in charge of an organisation that's spending a million dollars of taxpayers' money every day, and that's a very sobering thought, so you had to keep the reins on as well. Indeed, there were many frustrations in being CSIRO's Chairman at that time, of which he nominated as the worst [...] "the frustration of finding it so difficult to bring in new young blood because of the descending budget in real terms." ...|$|E

Former Fawlty Towers star, Andrew Sachs, was announced to be joining the show on 10 March 2015 as Cyril Bishop, roommate of Stan when he is admitted to hospital. Sachs' first scenes were announced to air on 18 March 2015. Cyril died in the following episode, saddening Stan. Bradshaw-White teased Stan's exit week {{in an interview with}} Inside Soap, saying that Tina would take over Stan's care when Mick and Shirley become too embroiled in arguing to notice the pain he is going through. Discussing Stan's death, Bradshaw-White said, [...] "Stan has another one of his episodes and Tina just falls apart. So {{the rest of the family}} end up sending her home - they think she's not going to be able to cope with him dying. Tina goes back to The Vic thinking that she'll come in and see her dad again in the morning, but then he tragically dies that night." [...] Stan's final scenes aired on 10 April 2015 when after an emotional heart-to-heart with Shirley, he peacefully died in a hospice. Rather than the regular [...] "Doof Doofs" [...] that feature at the end of each episode, Fly Me to the Moon, as sung by Tony Bennett, was played over the credits in tribute to Stan. Following his on-screen exit, West spoke out in support of Prostate Cancer UK and signed up for the Men United campaign, [...] "Stan was probably the archetypal bad patient. He was very slow in thinking about his condition and recognising what it might be. He was slow to seek diagnosis, slow to act on the diagnosis and reluctant to see doctors. He was terrible really, something we should all look at and not do the same.

60|$|This is {{the first}} {{principle}} of democracy: that the essential things in men are the things they hold in common, not the things they hold separately. And the second principle is merely this: that the political instinct or desire {{is one of these}} things which they hold in common. Falling in love is more poetical than dropping into poetry. The democratic contention is that government (helping to rule the tribe) is a thing like falling in love, and not a thing like dropping into poetry. It is not something analogous to playing the church organ, painting on vellum, discovering the North Pole (that insidious habit), looping the loop, being Astronomer Royal, and so on. For these things we do not wish a man to do at all unless he does them well. It is, on the contrary, a thing analogous to writing one's own love-letters or blowing one's own nose. These things we want a man to do for himself, even if he does them badly. I am not here arguing the truth of any of these conceptions; I know that some moderns are asking to have their wives chosen by scientists, and they may soon be asking, for all I know, to have their noses blown by nurses. I merely say that mankind does recognize these universal human functions, and that democracy classes government among them. In short, the democratic faith is this: that the most <b>terribly</b> <b>important</b> things must be left to ordinary men themselves--the mating of the sexes, the rearing of the young, the laws of the state. This is democracy; and in this I have always believed.|$|E

As this example implies, the term was already well-known, and in a 1996 The Paris Review interview, screenwriter Billy Wilder, referring to his 1938 screwball comedy film Bluebeard's Eighth Wife (in which two characters meet while shopping for pajamas, one seeking a pajama top and the other a pajama bottom) says that the concept was [...] "a staple of romantic comedies back then".

Sutton Vane (the younger) started out professionally as an actor, and might have made his mark in that field if not for the outbreak of the First World War. He joined the British army in 1914, at age 26, and served until he was invalided out due to malaria and shell-shock. Vane was haunted by guilt over this event, and once he sufficiently recovered, he returned to the combat area as a civilian, appearing for the entertainment of troops near the front lines during the later phase of the war—he made a particular impression in performances of Bayard Veiller's 1916 hit The Thirteenth Chair, which he did on many stages with artillery bursting well within earshot.

Wilson's impact on this part of theatre alone is immense.

Wilson makes it evident in his work that what's and why's of language are <b>terribly</b> <b>important</b> and cannot be overlooked. Tom Waits, acclaimed songwriter and collaborator with Wilson, said this about Wilson's unique relationship with words:Words for Bob are like tacks on the kitchen floor in the dark of night and you're barefoot. So Bob clears a path he can walk through words without getting hurt. Bob changes the values and shapes of words. In some sense they take on more meaning; in some cases, less.Wilson shows the importance of language through all of his works and in many varying fashions. He credits his reading of the work of Gertrude Stein and listening to recordings of her speaking with [...] "changing his way of thinking forever."

This would, he postulated, motivate them to learn how to interact effectively within any cultural environment. The result was the simulation game BaFá BaFá, which was originally accompanied by training modules, a comic strip, and language tapes. This was the first intercultural simulation, and when it was made generally available in 1974, it became the most widely used and well-known simulation in the field (Shirts 1974, 1975). It was founded on the idea of having trainees learn and become members of two contrasting cultures, Alpha and Beta, and then visiting each other. One is a more collectivist, people-oriented, touching culture, and the other, using a different language, is more individualistic and task oriented. The point of the interaction between members of the two cultures is to teach [...] "that what seems irrational, contradictory, or unimportant to us in our culture may seem rational, consistent, and <b>terribly</b> <b>important</b> in another culture" [...] (Shirts, 1995).

So CAFEBABE became the class file format, and CAFEDEAD was the persistent object format. But the persistent object facility went away, and along with it went the use of CAFEDEAD - it was eventually replaced by RMI.|$|E

I had a strong desire always to see pure and applied research undertaken {{side by side in}} the same laboratory.... And I was still very much aware that the recognition that many - most, I should say - of the really important and fundamental discoveries in science which subsequently led to a massive technological development have come through curiosity-led research, and often through serendipity, which is <b>terribly</b> <b>important.</b> I think the Birch report was very helpful, and I agreed with his report that the whole core of the policy-making in the science that we were going to carry out was a matter of defining the right proportion of, shall we say, pure research, strategic mission-oriented, and technical research - and getting that proportion right.... I felt that fundamental research in the end was going to reap the real benefits in the long run ... discovering something like electricity ... was absolutely fundamental research and had an enormous impact on the world. On the other hand, there was the awareness that you're in charge of an organisation that's spending a million dollars of taxpayers' money every day, and that's a very sobering thought, so you had to keep the reins on as well. Indeed, there were many frustrations in being CSIRO's Chairman at that time, of which he nominated as the worst [...] "the frustration of finding it so difficult to bring in new young blood because of the descending budget in real terms." ...|$|E
