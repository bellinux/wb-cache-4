We report the results of an experimental study which show that people judge that agents ought to perform an action even when they also judge that those agents cannot do it and that such “ought” judgments exhibit an actor-observer effect. Because of this actor-observer effect on “ought” judgments and the Duhem-Quine thesis, talk of an “empirical refutation” of OIC is empirically and methodologically unwarranted.

My argument has three premises: (1) obligations correspond to reasons for action; (2) reasons for action correspond to potential actions; (3) potential actions correspond to ability plus opportunity.

40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 P LMS 2016 Yangxv, 185 pages :illustrationsThis {{research}} employs two perspectives (i. e. {{continuous process}} improvement perspective and frontline employee perspective) {{to develop a}} new approach, operational improvement competence (OIC), and explores new, useful, empirically-based insights into the effectiveness of OIC in improving operational, service recovery and new service development performance. OIC is conceptualized as an operational team's ability to use a process perspective and structured methods to continuously improve operational activities and comprises three operational practices 1) continuous improvement; 2) process management; and 3) structured methods. However, the operational environment of service firms is often more dynamic and challenging than that of manufacturing firms so that the effectiveness of OIC in service operations may be affected by certain characteristics concerning service processes, employee characteristics and contextual factors. To offer useful insights into the challenges of OIC adoption in service operations, we conduct three empirical studies as follows: Study 1, guided by the operations management (OM) literature and agency theory, proposes that the effectiveness of OIC in operational performance in service operations is contingent on two factors, namely operations control and process control formality. Specifically, we theorize that operations control enhances the effectiveness of OIC by suppressing frontline service employees' discretion in service processes and guiding them to follow proper procedures to perform OIC activities. In addition, when there are high levels of ethical risks, operations control will become particularly important. Study 2 examines the impact of OIC on new service development (NSD) performance. Since creative ideas are crucial to NSD and it is common that service firms involve frontline employees in the process of NSD, we argue that frontline employees' creativity enhances NSD performance. In addition, since OIC pertains to making changes and solving problems regularly, we argue <b>that</b> <b>OIC</b> has a positive impact on employee creativity. Furthermore, we draw on the contingency theory to argue that the relationships between OIC, employee creativity, and NSD performance are contingent on team's characteristics and contextual environment. Study 3 argues <b>that</b> <b>OIC</b> leads to improved service recovery performance. However, the effectiveness of OIC in enhancing service recovery performance can be hindered by one common problem in service employees, namely stress. We draw on the role stress theory and the conservation of resources theory to argue that the negative impact of stress can be alleviated by job resources, including organization inducement and psychological resilience. Thus, we propose that frontline employees' stress and two types of job resources (i. e. organization inducement and psychological resilience) can moderate the effectiveness of OIC in improving service recovery performance. Based on data from 146 frontline teams in the banking industry of China, we empirically test the posited hypotheses of these three studies. The main contribution of this research lies in its consideration on the job characteristics of frontline service employees and use of several relevant theories to ascertain the intricacies between OIC and performance outcomes with respect to operational performance, service recovery performance and NSD performance.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 69 - 72). vii, 89 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmFollowing a factorial experimental design, {{a series}} of tests were performed to investigate the effects of operating parameters; oxygen to carbon ratio (O/C), steam to carbon ratio (SIC) and temperature (T), on reforming glycerin to a H 2 rich gas. A mathematical model defining the effect of those three variables was derived., and used for improving the reaction hydrogen yield. From the range of experimental conditions tested it was concluded <b>that</b> <b>OIC,</b> as well as the interaction between OIC and temperature had the most important effects on H 2 yield. 4. 5 mole of hydrogen were produced per mole of glycerin at experimental conditions of O/C= 1, S/C= 2. 2, and T= 804 °C. This is 65 % of the maximum theoretical yield, and 90 % of the yield predicted by thermochemical equilibrium. 1. 4 moles of carbon monoxide per mole of glycerin were also produced., presenting a potential for an additional 1. 4 mole hydrogen per mole glycerin. A water gas shift reaction was then used., and its operating temperature optimized, in order to convert the reformate gas CO into hydrogen by combining it with water. Results were satisfying, with a final yield of 5. 3 moles H 2 I mole glycerin, which is 75 % of the maximum stoichiometric hydrogen yield. Crude glycerin, obtained from biodiesel production, was finally tested (without a water gas shift) as a feed to compare it with pure glycerin used throughout the tests. The initial results were very encouraging, almost identical to those of pure glycerin, but carbon formation quickly became a problem. Possible contaminants causing the coking may include methanol, chloride and sodium cations, and free fatty acids, all present in crude glycerin as byproducts of biodiesel synthesis...|$|R

40|$|The phenomenon, channel segregates (CS) as {{a result}} of gravity-driven flow due to density {{contrast}} occurred in the solid-liquid mushy zones 1 during solidification, often causes the severe destruction of homogeneity and even some fatal damages. Investigation on its mechanism sheds light on the understanding and controlling of the formation of solidifying metals,earth's core, igneous rock and sea ice. Until now, it still remains controversial what composes the density contrasts and, to what extent, how it affects channel segregates. Here, we show that in experimental 500 kg and 100 ton commercial cast steel ingots CS originates from oxide Al 2 O 3 /MnS impurity clusters (OICs) initially nucleated from the oxide (Al 2 O 3) particles, which induce an extra flow due to sharp density contrast between clusters and melt. The results uncover <b>that,</b> as <b>OICs</b> enrich and grow, their driven flow becomes stronger than the traditionally recognized inter-dendritic thermo-solutal convection, dominating the subsequent opening of the channels. This study extends the classical macrosegregation theory, highlights a significant technological breakthrough to control CS, and could quickly yield practical benefits to the worldwide manufacture of over 50 million tons of ingots, super-thick slab and heavy castings annually, as well as has general implications for the elaboration of other related natural phenomena.

It was his first {{election}} attempt {{during a period of}} heavy social unrest, and involved an extremely active campaign which led to his defeat of an entrenched sixteen-year incumbent. Cortese won two subsequent re-elections and during his tenure chaired the Board three times. He also chaired the Local Agency Formation District twice (during which the Mid-Peninsula Regional Open Space District was authorized), the Santa Clara Valley Transportation District(which he was instrumental in creating as Chair of the Board of Supevisors and co-chair of the campaign to create the district) twice, and the Local Criminal Justice Planning Board created by Governor Ronald Reagan. He served as the Board's representative on the Regional Air Quality Board, the Bay Area Conservation and Development Commission, and ABAG. He was the Board's delegate to the local Economic Opportunity Commission (Federal War on Poverty). When the EOC was under threat of takeover by the Federal government, Cortese along with two other local officials founded the Economic and Social Opportunities Commission (ESO). He was asked to meet with President Jimmy Carter during the 1979 oil crisis after his proposal to support the President's [...] "Windfall Profits" [...] proposal and/or nationalize the oil companies was adopted by his Board and other cities and counties throughout the state. He was {{a founding member of the}} California Association of LAFCOS (CALAFCO) and was its President twice. Santa Clara County became only the second county in the state to adopt an ordinance which gave recognized employee groups the right to meet and confer and to negotiate wages and other terms and conditions of employment. He played a key role in the hiring of an Affirmative Action Officer and witnessed the signing of the Santa Clara Plan to phase in minority hiring within definite time constraints. Cortese headed a committee to bring to an end the long fought federal court battle over equality hiring in the Sheriff's office. This effort resulted in a vast recruiting and training program that culminated in the hiring of 60 Chicano deputies, approximately one half the number of vacancies. It was soon recognized that these officers were among the foremost in the department. He maintained close rapport with the local Opportunities Industrialization Center an affiliate of the national OIC founded by Dr. Leon Sullivan.

During his first year, Cortese appointed numerous persons of Spanish surname to county wide boards and commissions. From 1969 through 1980, the Board created the Commission on the Status of Women, the Commission on Drug Abuse and Alcoholism, and the Human Relations Commission. During the mid 1970s a new eleven story administration building was constructed.

40|$|The Karlovy Vary Massif (KVM) in {{northern}} Bohemia {{is a composite}} granite body built up of Late Variscan biotite, two mica and lithium mica granites. We summarize the available whole-rock geochemical and petrological data and correlate them with similar information from three boreholes in the northern and southwestern parts of the Massif. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine whether various types of granites differ in their physical and chemical properties, and whether any differences in physical characteristics affect the accuracy of geophysical interpretation. In accord with the earlier studies, we distinguish two geochemically and petrophysically contrasting granite suites - the Older Intrusive Complex (OIC) and Younger Intrusive Complex (YIC). The geochemical data show <b>that</b> the <b>OIC</b> and YIC granites differ significantly in the content of most major-element oxides (like SiO 2 , TiO 2 , FeO, Fe 2 O 3 tot, MgO and CaO). As to physical parameters, the granites differ markedly in magnetic susceptibilities and in the contents of radioactive elements (U and Th). From gravity and magnetic data we compiled a 22 km long geophysical profile, which crosses two of the three studied boreholes. For the construction of geological model along this profile, we used the data on the petrophysical properties measured on samples from the boreholes. Densities of the individual granite types are very similar to each other and thus the distinction of the OIC and YIC granites based on gravity data is not possible. Magnetic susceptibility differs markedly for the OIC and YIC granites in the drill logs, but absolute values of magnetic susceptibilities are very low. Modelling showed that neither gravimetry nor magnetometry are suitable methods for distinguishing between the different types of granites. On the other hand, it proved that the spatial distribution of individual granite intrusions does not affect the overall interpretation of the shape, size and depth of the whole granite body...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this Bachelor thesis is „Recognitional {{solidarity}} or dissolidarity of Organization of the Islamic Conference {{in the direction}} of islamic countries: Kosovo example“. The questionable solidarity issue is important in the islamic world because the islamic religion says that solidarity and unity are the most important aspects in taking decisions by government or state. Almost half of the members of OIC do not follow that principle and are not solidary with the new states of the same religion. Kosovo is a good example – the state is not recognised by half of OICs members and it is important to research why this is. Firstly, it is important to describe in what conditions a state has a right for recognision. The islamic law is slightly different form the International law. The first chapter describes the differences and the priorities that have to be accepted by islamic state who wants to be recognised by other islamic states and International community. Secondly there is an assessement which tries to find out if Kosovo has a right for recognition by islamic and International community based on the criterias described in the first chapter. Kosovo have the match with most of the criterias and thus {{it can be said that}} islamic countries are not solidary with each other based on recognition problem. The third part of bachelor thesis describes the reasons why there is no solidarity between OIC members and the new islamic states. The most important reason is connected to the fact <b>that</b> dissolidary <b>OIC’s</b> member states have very good relations with Russia, who is not intrested in recognising Kosovo. So, Russia has huge influence to <b>OIC</b> members <b>that</b> do not recognise Kosovo. There are also other reasons for lack of solidarity within islamic world.

These mafic magmas homogenized granitic partial melts from lower crustal sources and produced large volumes of highly evolved magma portions via fractional crystallization. The granite magmas with I-type or transitional I/S-type characteristics evolved towards the low-P 2 O 5 compositions. This process was disturbed by episodic hybridization of the granite magmas with the mantle-derived melts or products of their fractionation at depth. The YIC granites probably represent residual, late-stage melts rich in volatiles, with strongly increased incompatible element abundances due to prolonged crystal fractionation. Their composition was strongly affected by interaction with an aqueous fluid phase that changed the phosphorus distribution in only a minor way. Late magmatic and post-magmatic processes obscured the primary chemical characteristics namely in the Li-rich granites. This fact could be the reason for the absence of any correlation between the generally low P 2 O 5 and highly variable alumina-saturation indices. The phosphorus contents thus reflect various aspects of rather complex genetic histories of Late Variscan igneous rocks in the EVPC, particularly within the lower and middle crust. In contrast with the role of phosphorus, the contents of lithium and fluorine are more dependent on subsolidus alterations of granites induced by hydrothermal fluids in late magmatic and post-magmatic stages at shallow crustal levels...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the influence of}} inward technology transfers and international entrepreneurial orientation (IEO) on the export performance of small and medium-sized firms (SMEs). IEO and innovation are frequently cited as critical antecedents of export activities. Highly entrepreneurial and innovative firms seek to capitalize on their unique intellectual property by penetrating a niche global market quickly. Extant research primarily focuses on technology innovators, in countries well known for their technological advances and support of technology based start-ups. However, SMEs {{that do not have}} a technological niche also internationalize. This phenomenon is particularly prevalent in developing economies like Egypt, where horizontal flows of technology (the transfer of technology from one organization to another), especially from overseas companies, are more common than vertical transfers of technology (i. e., from researchers directly to organizations). 	The literature suggests that many SMEs, especially those in developing economies, rely on the horizontal inflow of technology to enhance their export potential. The hypothesis is that by importing technology, firms also develop an outward internationalization capability (OIC). A second hypothesis is that IEO contributes to creating such capability. The literature postulates that IEO is a dynamic capability that helps firms exploit and reconfigure their resources to pursue international opportunities. Thus, firms with a higher IEO are more likely to develop OIC than are their less entrepreneurially oriented counterparts. Also, firms with a higher IEO {{are more likely to be}} involved in inflow of technology processes than are their counterparts. 	Despite evidence of a link between innovation and export performance, there is a dearth of research examining how inward transfers of technology from other countries influence the development of capabilities and outward internationalization of firms. This research addresses this gap by using resource-based view of the firm, dynamic capabilities view, network theory, and the concept of entrepreneurial orientation, to develop an explanation of how inward transfers of foreign technology may influence the internationalization capability and export performance of firms. Hypotheses are tested in the context of horizontal transfers of foreign technology to SMEs located in Egypt. 	The research progressed in two stages. In the first stage, interviews with managers of firms having experience importing technology and with substantial export activity helped to identify and confirm relevant factors <b>that</b> comprise <b>OIC.</b> During the second stage, data on inflows of technology (IFT), IEO, OIC, and exports were collected from a sample of 214 SMEs by a survey. Research results identified capabilities that underlie the outward internationalization of SMEs, by developing an OIC scale. There are no measures for OIC in extant literature. Thus, this research contributes to the development of a valid and reliable measure of this construct. Findings support the hypothesis that IEO has a direct positive effect on export performance. The relationships between IEO and export performance is partially mediated by OIC. On the other hand, the relationship between inflows of technology and export performance is fully mediated by OIC, where this research found that IFT does not have a direct effect on export performance. The research results further suggest that the level of OIC development is mainly explained by IEO, but with some contribution from IFT. The research contributes to streams of literature in international business, international entrepreneurship and management of technology. In particular, it expands the understanding of linkages between inward internationalization (inward flow of technology) and outward internationalization (export activities). The linkage between inward and outward internationalization processes received limited attention in the literature, and such research is rarer still in the context of SMEs in developing economies. The research additionally investigates the influence of a 'firm's strategic orientation (IEO) on export performance. While IEO is suggested to have a direct effect on export performance, IEO is also suggested to be an antecedent of OIC, which in turn affects export performance. Studying the mediating effect of OIC contributes to clarifying the conflicting findings of previous studies that examined the impact of entrepreneurial behaviour on international performance. The results provide owners/managers of SMEs with guidance on how to lever technology transfers by building related capabilities. The research also provides SMEs with guidance on how to measure and assess their OIC, and understand how such capability can be built or enhanced. The results additionally clarify the role of a firm's strategic orientation (IEO) in the configuration of resources and the creation of capabilities. Finally, the research helps policy-makers structure export-support polices that explicitly take advantage of opportunities presented by technology imports...|$|R
