5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Roddenberry was likely afflicted {{by the first}} manifestations of {{cerebral}} vascular disease and encephalopathy {{as a result of}} his longstanding recreational use of legal and illicit drugs, including alcohol, cannabis, diazepam, secobarbital, methaqualone, methylphenidate, Dexamyl, and cocaine (which he had used regularly since the production of Star Trek: The Motion Picture). Throughout much of his career, he had routinely used stimulants <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> night on scripts, especially amphetamines. The effects of these substances were compounded by deleterious interactions with diabetes, high blood pressure, and antidepressant prescriptions.|$|E

25|$|The Great Books are not {{the only}} texts used at St. John's. Greek and French classes make use of {{supplemental}} materials that are more like traditional textbooks. Science laboratory courses and mathematics courses use manuals prepared by faculty members that combine source materials with workbook exercises.

25|$|Apollo was {{commissioned}} in July 1805 under Captain Edward Fellowes, who sailed {{her for the}} Mediterranean on 26 January 1806. In 1806 she operated off southern Italy. On 5 June boats from Apollo brought out a French brig near Agie Finucana, in the Gulf of Taranto, where she had run aground. The brig was transporting six 24-pounder guns, together with their carriages. The cutting out party had <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> night under small-arms fire from the shore, as well as fire from a field piece. Still, they managed to retrieve the vessel while suffering only one man wounded. The guns were intended for a new battery opposite the lighthouse.|$|E
25|$|In 1956 {{he began}} <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> artist's agent B. L. Kearley Ltd, whose rep Patsy Lambe {{referred}} him to Mabel George, editor of children's books at Oxford University Press. George commissioned him to illustrate Rosemary Sutcliff's historical children's novel The Silver Branch. He was unenthused {{by the ancient}} Roman subject matter, but experimented with double page spreads and drawings in the margins, and was quickly assigned more books by Sutcliff and others, including Henry Treece. This began a professional relationship with Oxford University Press, for whom he illustrated more books than for any other publisher. Keeping, along with Victor Ambrus, established a new, exuberant style of illustration for children's historical fiction, refusing {{to shy away from}} the violence of warfare.|$|E
25|$|Civil {{rights activists}} tried <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{barriers}} to register African-American voters and {{enable them to}} vote. In the summer of 1963, from July through August, activists of the Congress for Racial Equality (CORE) came to Plaquemines Parish to run a voter registration drive for African Americans. About 45 members, both black and white, came {{to work in the}} parish and organize local people for voter registration classes, peaceful marches, and drives to register. In a short time, 300 CORE activists and local people were arrested for peaceful protest, but CORE leaders negotiated with the local sheriff and mayor to permit some actions. After training and concerted action, a number of local African Americans did succeed in registering to vote, although many were still prevented, on largely specious grounds for failing to answer questions about the state constitution. The movement also worked to get Seymourville and another small community included within the city boundaries; the city was trying to exclude these majority-black communities from being incorporated in order to prevent black votes from being counted for election of the city commission. Voting rights work took place in other nearby parishes as well; in October an African-American man was the first of his race to register to vote in West Feliciana Parish since the early years following disenfranchisement.|$|E

25|$|Buckley became {{interested}} in recording at Easley McCain Recording in Memphis, {{at the suggestion of}} friend Dave Shouse from the Grifters. He rented a shotgun house there, of which he was so fond he contacted the owner about the possibility of buying it. Throughout this period, February 12 to May 26, 1997, Buckley played at Barristers', a bar located in downtown Memphis underneath a parking garage in an alley off Jefferson Avenue. He played numerous times in order <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> new material in a live atmosphere, at first with the band then solo as part of a Monday night residency. In early February, Buckley and the band did a third recording session with Verlaine, in Memphis, but Buckley expressed his dissatisfaction with the sessions and later called Grace producer, Andy Wallace, to step in as Verlaine's replacement. Buckley started recording demos on his own 4-track recorder in preparation for a forthcoming session with Wallace. Some of these demos were sent to his band in New York, who listened to them enthusiastically, and were excited to resume working on the album. These recordings would go on to compose the second disc of Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk. However Buckley was not entirely happy with the results and he sent his band back to New York while he stayed behind to work on the songs. The band was scheduled to return to Memphis for rehearsals and recording sessions on May 29.|$|E

In any mode, players attempt to match notes on instrument controllers as indicated by scrolling notes on-screen in order to score points and prevent the song from ending in failure. To match notes, lead and bass guitar players hold down fret buttons while strumming on the controller, drum players strike the matching drum pads on the drum controller, and vocalists attempt to match pitch with the song.

Albert García of Eurogamer considered that the series is still lacking features found in the console-based games, but remains a consistent [...] "little brother" [...] to the main series' titles. The soundtrack was considered to have stronger guitar portions than from previous games, but still felt like a [...] "disco" [...] collection. Modern Hits was criticized in part for being a [...] "victim of Nintendo's timing", according to Harris, as the game was released shortly after {{the arrival of the}} Nintendo DSi unit, which lacks the necessary port to use the Guitar Grip, thus making Modern Hits unplayable on the system.|$|E

500|$|Lee had <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{issue of}} how to write Anna's personality, in that some of her colleagues felt Anna should be more {{dysfunctional}} and co-dependent, like Vanellope von Schweetz in Wreck-It Ralph. Lee disagreed with that position, but it took her almost a year {{to figure out how}} to convincingly articulate [...] "this is what Anna's journey is. No more than that. No less than that." [...] In the end, Lee successfully argued Anna's journey should be presented as a simple coming-of-age story, [...] "where she goes from having a naive view of life and love– because she's lonely– to the most sophisticated and mature view of love, where she's capable of the ultimate love, which is sacrifice." [...] Lee also had to let go of some ideas that she liked, such as a scene portraying Anna and Elsa's relationship as teenagers, which did not work because they needed to maintain the separation between Anna and Elsa.|$|E

[...] The philosopher Alan Soble criticized Scruton's treatment of masturbation and found some of his judgments (for example, that all masturbation is [...] "obscene") to be [...] "silly". The philosopher James Giles argued that Scruton is mistaken to think that sexual desire essentially aims at an individual person, since it can be desire simply for sexual activity.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most famous}} of the heavy warmbloods was the Oldenburg. Today's Oldenburg is bred for sport, and so the old type is {{designated}} as such: Alt-Oldenburger. The history of the Oldenburg is almost indistinguishable from that of horses bred in nearby East Frisia. Though there are two names (Old-Oldenburg and East Friesian), the horse is quite the same, having always exchanged genetic material. The plow horses of the Frisian marshes had to be powerful <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> heavy soil, and so were significantly heavier than farm horses {{in other parts of}} Europe. Organized horse breeding began in Oldenburg under Count Anton Günther (1603–1667), who brought popular stallions from Spain, Italy, Turkey, and Poland. Later on, Cleveland Bays were introduced as well, and the result was a solid, good-natured mare base from which came the Karossier.|$|E
