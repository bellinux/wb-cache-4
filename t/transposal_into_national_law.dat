40|$|The <b>transposal</b> <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law</b> of the European Marine Strategy {{represents}} {{the first step}} towards {{the establishment of the}} so-called European Maritime Policy. This new policy aims to provide a sustainable and coherent dimension to human interventions on the European coasts. In the Spanish case, the Law 41 / 2010 has transposed the EU Strategy in a much clearer manner than the wording of the EU lawmaker. One of the Spanish regions that necessitates demarcation lines is the area between the Strait of Gibraltar and Isla de Alborán, where maritime boundaries are yet to be defined. Indeed, the existence of a territorial dispute between Spain and the United Kingdom over the waters around Gibraltar and the recent conflict regarding the Sites of Community Importance (SCI) have created serious difficulties in implementing the Marine Strategy...|$|E

5000|$|If {{international}} {{law is not}} directly applicable, {{as is the case}} in dualist systems, then it must be translated <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law,</b> and existing <b>national</b> <b>law</b> that contradicts {{international law}} must be [...] "translated away". It must be modified or eliminated in order to conform to international law.Again, from a human rights point of view, if a human rights treaty is accepted for purely political reasons, and states do not intend to fully translate it <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law</b> or to take a monist view on international law, then the implementation of the treaty is very uncertain.|$|R
50|$|In 1986, the European Communities enacted Directive 86/653/EEC on {{self-employed}} commercial agents. In the UK, {{this was}} implemented <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law</b> in the Commercial Agents Regulations 1993.|$|R
50|$|Self-executing {{rights in}} {{international}} human rights law are rights that are formulated {{in such a way}} that one can deduce that it was the purpose to create international laws that citizens can invoke directly in their national courts. Self-executing rights, or directly applicable rights, are rights which, from the viewpoint of international law, do not require transformation <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law.</b> They are binding as such and national judges can apply them as such, as if they were national rules. From the viewpoint of <b>national</b> <b>law,</b> it may be required that all international <b>law</b> be incorporated <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law</b> before becoming valid. This depends on the national legal tradition.|$|R
50|$|The now {{repealed}} Directive 2003/54/EC gave {{member states}} three possible ways to unbundle. One {{of them has}} to be transposed <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law.</b> The United Kingdom, for example, has already implemented ownership unbundling.|$|R
50|$|The {{right to}} access to {{information}} of public relevance is translated <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law</b> by the Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance adopted in 2003 and amended in 2007 and 2009.|$|R
5000|$|If a {{piece of}} law (usually a directive, but also a {{regulation}} on occasion) is described as maximum harmonisation, that means that <b>national</b> <b>law</b> may not exceed {{the terms of the}} legislation. In practice, this prohibits gold-plating of European legislation when it is transposed <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Directive {{specifies}} a {{range of}} regulations which have to be transformed <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law</b> by the Member State, whereas the Directive only sets minimum standards. Member State have the possibility to set up stricter rules.|$|R
50|$|The {{directive}} {{came into}} force on July 21, 2011. On November 16, 2011, ESMA issued technical {{advice to the}} European Commission (EC) on possible implementation measures for the AIFMD. On December 19, 2012, the EC added a series of new regulations to supplement the AIFMD text. EU member states were required to write the AIFMD <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law</b> by no later than July 22, 2013. As of July 2014, not every EU member state had transposed the AIFMD <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law.</b> Some, but not all, member states provided for a one-year transition period, beginning July 22, 2013, before AIFMs would become subject to the AIFMD requirements.|$|R
5000|$|Specific {{rights and}} {{obligations}} created by EU law are {{by virtue of the}} European Communities Act incorporated <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law</b> and rank supreme over <b>national</b> <b>law.</b> Where there is an inconsistency between an EU law right or obligation and <b>national</b> <b>law,</b> the latter must be modified or abrogated, even where it is contained in an Act of Parliament.|$|R
25|$|Further, in the 1991 Francovich case, the ECJ {{established}} that Member States could be liable {{to pay compensation}} to individuals who suffered a loss by reason of the Member State's failure to transpose an EU directive <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law.</b>|$|R
50|$|CEDAW is {{a global}} human rights treaty that should be {{incorporated}} <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law</b> as the highest standard for women's rights. It requires UN Member States that have ratified it (185 to date) to set in place mechanisms to fully realize women's rights.|$|R
50|$|The Directive covers fixed telephony, mobile telephony, Internet access, email, and VoIP. Member States were {{required}} to transpose it <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law</b> within 18 months—no later than September 2007. However, they may if they wish postpone {{the application of the}} Directive to Internet access, email, and VoIP for a further 18 months after this date. A majority of Member States exercised this option. All 28 EU States have notified the European Commission about the transposition of the Directive <b>into</b> their <b>national</b> <b>law.</b> Of these, however, Germany and Belgium have only transposed the legislation partially.|$|R
40|$|Development of Indonesian <b>national</b> <b>law</b> {{should not}} leave {{attention}} to development of legal plurality as its source. Focus {{of this study}} is to see the influence of Indonesian social factors on the development of Islamic law and how Islamic law can be integratively transformed <b>into</b> the <b>National</b> <b>Law.</b> By qualitative method and socio-legal approach and constructivism paradigm, this study bases on theories of social change influeces on Islamic law law without leaving methodology of usul fiqh and the sources of Islamic law. Islamic law has broad opportunity and experiences to be integratively transformed <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law</b> within Indonesia's own character. Transformation can be done in the whole structure of Islamic law including its values of philosophy, principles and norms, and can be performed in all areas, both private and public Law, written law by political power and unwritten law with cultural approach. However, Islamic law as one of the Indonesia living laws and the sources of <b>National</b> <b>law,</b> still today is viewed in dichotomy to the <b>National</b> <b>law</b> and only transformed in limited norms. There are many obstacles to be transformed <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law</b> integratively and widely, though Islamic law has wide space of interpretation and intellectualism that can adapt to different contexts and <b>National</b> <b>law...</b>|$|R
50|$|Requirements {{of the new}} Machinery Directive were {{transcribed}} <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law</b> of {{each country}} of the European Union (transcript {{had to be made}} before June 29, 2008) so that this new machine Directive shall apply starting from 29 December 2009 and replaces Machinery Directive 98/37/EC.|$|R
50|$|The {{requirement}} of the European Directive 93/98/EEC to introduce a publication right <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law</b> was implemented in the UK on 1st December 1996 by the Copyright and Related Rights Regulations 1996, a Statutory instrument which modified the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988.|$|R
5000|$|In dualist systems, {{international}} law must be translated <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law,</b> and existing <b>national</b> <b>law</b> that contradicts {{international law}} must be [...] "translated away". It must be modified or eliminated {{in order to}} conform to international law. However, the need for translation in dualist system causes a problem with regard to <b>national</b> <b>laws</b> voted after the act of translation. In a monist system, a <b>national</b> <b>law</b> that is voted after an international law has been accepted and that contradicts the international law, becomes automatically null and void at the moment it is voted. The international rule continues to prevail. In a dualist system, however, the original international law has been translated <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law</b> - if all went well - but this <b>national</b> <b>law</b> can then be overridden by another <b>national</b> <b>law</b> {{on the principle of}} [...] "lex posterior derogat legi priori", the later law replaces the earlier one. This means that the country - willingly or unwillingly - violates international law. A dualist system requires continuous screening of all subsequent <b>national</b> <b>law</b> for possible incompatibility with earlier international law.|$|R

5000|$|The {{legal basis}} of the United Kingdom's {{relationship}} with the EU rests on <b>national</b> <b>law</b> provisions and not EU law.

50|$|In 1986, the European Communities enacted Directive 86/653/EEC on {{self-employed}} commercial agents.

40|$|The {{transfer}} of undertakings, businesses {{or parts of}} undertakings or businesses by legal transfer or merger determine important changes {{in the structure of}} the participant entities. The change of their juridical organisation has significant consequences on the employees&# 39; rights, reason why, both nationally and internationally, normative acts that would regulate appropriate safeguarding mechanisms have been adopted. The paper aims to analyse the transposition <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law</b> of the communitarian norms in the field. As a result, the legal aspects with regards to which the legislator chose a restrictive transposition, as well as the additional rights established by them in favour of the employees, in comparison to the directive are identified. At the same time, the study emphasizes the aspects with regards to which the Romanian law requires to be changed and therefore makes some proposals de lege ferenda, so that the transposition of the communitarian normative act <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law</b> would be a precise one and consistent to the other dispositions regarding <b>national</b> <b>law...</b>|$|R
