5|$|Describing {{himself as}} a {{descendant}} of <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> traditions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Piłsudski believed in a multicultural Poland - a home of nations, recognizing numerous ethnic and religious nationalities and finally existing in strong historical alliance with independent states of Lithuania and Ukraine. His main opponent Roman Dmowski by contrast called for an independent state of Poland narrowed to the lands of historical Crown and founded mainly on an ethnically Polish demos and Roman Catholic identity.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi also campaigned hard {{going from}} one rural corner of the Indian subcontinent to another. He used {{terminology}} and phrases such as Rama-rajya from Ramayana, Prahlada as a paradigmatic icon, and such cultural symbols as another facet of swaraj and satyagraha. These ideas sounded strange outside India, during his lifetime, but they readily and deeply resonated with <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> historic values of his people.|$|E

5|$|Production {{designer}} Kenneth Mak included Western {{elements in}} his design, since Foshan, in earlier years, {{was a unique}} place where Chinese and Western cultures converged. Pillars were made to resemble English lampposts, and Western lighting, chairs and tableware were also used. To convey <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> feel of the time, the buildings were made to look obsolete and worn out. Apart from historical references, Mak also created a glass house which was used in a scene in the film.|$|E

50|$|The gradual {{disappearance}} of <b>the</b> Melanau <b>cultures</b> <b>and</b> dialects is further aggravated {{by the absence}} of qualified Melanau staff members handling the documentation on <b>the</b> Melanau <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> history in <b>the</b> 'Majlis Adat Istiadat' department in Sarawak.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> monuments {{of ancient}} Egypt {{have left a}} lasting legacy on the world. The cult of the goddess Isis, for example, became popular in the Roman Empire, as obelisks and other relics were transported back to Rome.

Early historians such as Herodotus, Strabo, and Diodorus Siculus studied and wrote about the land, which Romans came to view {{as a place of}} mystery.|$|E
5|$|The simpler {{roots of}} designs in Generation I {{prompted}} greater complexity in later games. Designs, in general, {{have become increasingly}} complex and thematic in newer games. Sneasel, for example, draws inspiration from the Japanese yōkai kamaitachi, mythical creatures with fast, razor-sharp claws that hunt in packs. These elements are all found in Sneasel's design and characteristics. New Pokémon introduced in Generation VI, for example, are heavily influenced by <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> fauna of Europe (namely France). However, by the release of X and Y in 2013, Sugimori stated he wishes for Pokémon design {{to return to the}} simpler roots of the franchise.|$|E

5|$|According to Abdul Baqir Zein, {{the mosque}} was first built in 1700 {{at the foot}} of Mount Padang, then moved to the bank of Batang Arau, as the Dutch colonial {{government}} intended to use the previous location to build a road to Emma Haven Port. It was later moved to its present location. However, the Indonesian Department of Religion documents the mosque as having been constructed in 1790 with a wooden frame and a roof made from Sago palms. According to this documentation, a sturdier mosque was built in 1805. Another history of the mosque, from <b>the</b> <b>Culture</b> <b>and</b> Tourism Department of the City of the Padang, suggests that the mosque was first constructed in 1805. The small mosque had stone flooring, wood and dirt walls, and a pyramidal ceiling like the mosques in Java.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{predominantly}} populated by humans, Spira features {{a variety of}} races. The people of Spira mainly reside in small towns and villages and cities like Bevelle and Luca.

The main characters Rikku, is Al Bhed, and Yuna is part Al Bhed on her mother's side; and assistance in gained through a cast of supporting Al Bhed character's, prevalent in Final Fantasy X-2. With the collapse of the teachings of Yevon and the wider acceptance of machina at the end of Final Fantasy X, prejudice against the Al Bhed seems to have eased significantly by the time of Final Fantasy X-2, though it is still present.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from sports}} that have world-wide appeal and competitions, {{such as the}} Olympic Games, the {{entertainment}} value of a sport depends on <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> country {{in which it is}} played. For example, in the United States, baseball and basketball games are popular forms of entertainment; in Bhutan, the national sport is archery; in New Zealand, it is rugby union; in Iran, it is freestyle wrestling. Japan's unique sumo wrestling contains ritual elements that derive from its long history. In some cases, such as the international running group Hash House Harriers, participants create a blend of sport and entertainment for themselves, largely independent of spectator involvement, where the social component {{is more important than the}} competitive.|$|E
5|$|Born in Caen, Normandy to {{an aristocratic}} family, Michel-Guillaume Hector St. John de Crèvecœur {{received}} a Jesuit {{education at the}} Jesuit Collège Royal de Bourbon.

Shortly after this, possibly due to the death of his fiancée, he joined a French regiment in Canada engaged in the French and Indian War (1754–1763). After being wounded in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham (1759), Crèvecœur resigned his commission and began traveling widely across Pennsylvania and New York.|$|E
