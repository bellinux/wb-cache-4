40|$|The {{flight control}} systems, {{designed}} {{in order to}} assure the necessary safety level even in failure conditions, are generally characterized by a proper redundant layout. The redundancies must be designed in order to assure an adequate system behavior when some failures are present; in fact an incorrect layout may cause serious shortcomings concerning the response when some component is not operational. Therefore the usual correct design activities request the complete analysis of the system behavior in failure condition. The work analyses the response of a redundant secondary flight control hydraulic servo-mechanism equipped with some proper <b>equalization</b> <b>devices,</b> {{when some of the}} most probable and representative failures are present. It must be noted that the redundancy layout, designed in order to assure the necessary safety level even in failure conditions, may behave improperly during normal operations, if the system architecture is unsuitable, when manufacturing defects are present. The improper behavior, generally consisting of force fighting or speed fighting caused by different offsets or asymmetries between the two sections of the system, may be usually overcome by means of a suitable <b>equalization</b> <b>device.</b> Therefore, the system behavior during and following the failure transient greatly depends on both its redundancy architecture and related <b>equalization</b> <b>device.</b> The above mentioned problems have been studied by means of an appropriate physical-mathematical model of a typical electro-hydraulic servo-mechanism prepared to the purpose, performing a certain number of simulations of representative actuations in which different types of failures are accurately modeled.

A study of two battery systems, one equipped with PowerCheq equalizers, a new battery <b>equalization</b> <b>device,</b> and one without, was conducted over 450 charge and discharge cycles simulating an electric scooter drive routine.

In concrete terms, we suggest that when <b>equalization</b> <b>devices</b> are perceived as unfair by one or more regions, political conflict may emerge as a result. Political conflict is analysed through a non cooperative game. Regions are formed by identical individuals who, through lobbying, try to impose their regional preferences on the rest of the country, and political conflict is measured as the total contribution to lobbying. We conclude that the onset of conflict depends on the degree of publicness of the regional budget. When regional budgets are used to provide pure public goods, proportional equalization is politically feasible. However, no equalization rule is immune to conflict when budgets are used to provide private goods or a linear combination of private and public goods. political conflict, lobbying, equalization grants, social decision rules...|$|R

As a result, under natural indoor air temperatures, the monthly average indoor air temperature level and the time ratio of indoor air temperature surpassing the outdoor air temperature were in the following order: Type I > Type WM > Type M. Type WM exhibited the highest phase shift of air temperature, indicating that the insulation performance and heat capacity affect the phase shift of air <b>temperature.</b> The <b>equalization</b> of indoor air temperature through the suppression of the increase in the indoor air temperature of Type M is likely caused by low insulation performance and large thermal capacity.

To allow for a detailed insight in the electrochemical behavior of the cell, commercially available 26650 cells were modified to allow for measuring local potentials at four different, nearly equidistant positions along the electrodes. As a follow-up to our previous work investigating local potentials within a cell, we apply this method for studying SOC deviations and their sensitivity to cell temperature. The local potential distribution was studied during constant current discharge operations for various current rates and discharge pulses in order to evoke local inhomogeneities for temperatures ranging from 10 °C to 40 °C. Differences in local potentials were considered for estimating local SOC variations within the electrodes. It could be observed that even low currents such as 0. 1 C can lead to significant inhomogeneities, whereas a higher cell temperature generally results in more pronounced inhomogeneities. A rapid SOC equilibration can be observed if the variation in the SOC distribution corresponds to a considerable potential difference defined by the open circuit voltage of either {{the positive or negative}} electrode.

Based on the solution of differential equation system of heat and mass transfer, the method to determine the conductive and steam-diffusive heat transfer constituents in wet soils was developed. To measure the thermophysical properties in laboratory setting, a pulse method of a two-dimensional heat source was used. The method takes into account the patterns of <b>temperature</b> field <b>equalization</b> in an unbounded medium after the heat source termination. A feature of this process is the occurrence of peak temperature at the investigated point of the medium at a given instant. In this experiment, the temperature was controlled not only at the investigated point of the medium, but also at the soil-heater interface. The proposed method was used to study the thermophysical indices of the chernozems of the Altai Region’s Priobye area (the Ob River area). The chernozem under study is of light-loamy particle-size composition; the illuvial horizon В is enriched by a sand fraction. It has been found that the soil conductive thermal diffusivity is reduced with increasing moisture content. The steam-diffusive thermal diffusivity has the extremum at the moisture close to the discontinuous capillary moisture. In humus horizons it plays a smaller role than in the mineral horizons. The thermal diffusivity determined by the steam molecule motion in the pore space of the soil exceeds the conductive thermal diffusivity two or three times. At the same time thermal steam diffusivity is more than ten time lower than the conductive constituent. Eventually, the stem molecules though dramatically accelerating the processes of heat transfer in the soil profile conduct a small amount of heat and make a weak contribution to soil thermal accumulation...|$|R

The steels were examined using optical microscopy, analytical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDAX). After the 4 th rolling pass, in a five pass schedule, the initial coarse austenite grain size (≈ 1 mm) was reduced to about 50 μm in Steel V-N and 22 μm in Steel V-Ti-N. The average ferrite grain size in the final strip was slightly smaller in Steel V-Ti-N (4. 8 - 6. 6 μm) than in Steel V-N (5. 3 - 7. 2 μm). For Steel V-N, VN was only observed after 1 050 °C equalization, {{but it was not}} found after 1 200 °C and 1 100 °C equalisation. For Steel V-Ti-N, V-Ti(N) particles formed during casting and during equalization for all the <b>equalization</b> <b>temperatures</b> (1 200 °C, 1 100 °C and 1 050 °C). AlN particles precipitated in Steel V-N only during 1 050 °C equalization and were often associated with MnS or MnS and VN. No AlN was detected in Steel V-Ti-N. Fine V containing precipitates (< 10 nm) were observed in the final strip for both of the steels, but the frequency of the fine particles was lower in Steel V-Ti-N than in Steel V-N. The fine precipitates in the final strip make a major contribution to dispersion strengthening. High strength (LYS≈ 460 - 560 MPa) with good toughness and good ductility were achieved in the steels, which are competitive to similar products made by conventional controlled rolling. However, the addition of Ti to the V-N steel decreased the yield strength due to formation of V-Ti(N) particles in austenite, which reduced the amounts of V and N available for subsequent V rich fine particle precipitation in ferrite...|$|R
40|$|The {{superchilling}} {{process is}} defined as a method of preserving food by partial ice-crystallization. The product quality of superchilled food is very promising, and has nearly the same sensorial attributes and nutritional value as the original product. However, more research is required to make the technology more suitable to the preservation of food. The optimal degree of superchilling and information {{on the development of the}} ice crystals during the superchilling process and storage are needed because of their large influence on the quality of the final superchilled food. The main objective of this thesis was modelling and studying of ice crystallization/recrystallization of food during the superchilling process and storage. In order to fulfil the objective the following research activities have been carried out: A one-dimensional model for predicting partial freezing time necessary to achieve an optimal degree of superchilling in foods was developed. The degree of superchilling is the amount of free water frozen (5 - 30 %) inside the food and is among the most important parameters which influence the quality of superchilled product. The study of the ice crystallization/recrystallization of food in superchilling technology was studied based on the superchilling rate, and the state of food muscle. The relationship between the development of ice crystals in salmon and quality parameters during the superchilled storage was also studied. The final research activity in this thesis was to study differences in the superchilling storage methods, shell freezing and non- shell freezing. The developed model was sufficient to study the thermal behaviour of food, and had the advantage that it was simple, very fast and detailed enough to estimate the superchilling time and behaviour of food. The model was validated experimentally using salmon, and there was good agreement between the numerical and experimental results. Further study to quantify the model using other food products is recommended. The characteristics of ice crystals have a large influence on the quality of the final superchilled food. At a high superchilling rate (227 W/m 2. K, - 30 ℃ and 2. 1 min), smaller and well distributed ice crystals within and outside the cell were formed compared to a slow superchilling rate (153 W/m 2. K, - 20 ℃ and 4. 2 min), where larger and extra-cellular ice crystals were formed. The state of muscle also has an influence on the characteristics of ice crystals. In pre-rigor muscle, the ice crystals were formed inside the cells regardless of the superchilling rate. However, at a slow superchilling rate the ice crystal size was larger than at a high superchilling rate. The formation of the ice crystals inside the cells, regardless of the superchilling rates, is the most important factor for reducing the damage of food muscles and hence maintaining the quality. New information was discovered in this work on the development of ice crystals during the superchilling process and storage of salmon. There was a significant increase in ice crystal size between the superchilling process (day 0) and superchilled storage (after 1 day of storage). The ice crystals formed in the surface layer were 4 times larger after only 1 day of storage than those formed at day 0. Prior to temperature equalisation, ice crystals growth progressed from the surface to the centre of the superchilled food. Different layers with different sizes of ice crystals within the superchilled salmon were also observed. This was due to thermal behaviour within the superchilled sample, and because we have both ice at the surface and water at the centre, the diffusion process should occur. The recrystallization at this time (between day 0 and 1) is unavoidable however, after <b>temperature</b> <b>equalization</b> (after 1 day of storage) and control of temperature during storage there was no significant growth of ice crystals for the entire storage time. The development of ice crystals in red salmon muscle was also studied during the superchilling process and storage. The size of the ice crystals formed in the red salmon muscle was smaller than those formed in the white salmon muscle. In addition, the ice crystals formed in the pre-rigor red muscle was smaller than that formed in the post-rigor red salmon muscle. These findings are significant for the industry because small ice crystals indicate better quality. Quality changes have been studied with a focus on physical measurements, water holding capacity (WHC) and drip loss. The disappearance of liquid water is a major factor affecting the protein changes during superchilled storage. It was observed that the drip loss was lower in superchilled salmon compared to conventional chilled salmon, and frozen salmon between 1 and 14 days of storage. No significant differences were found in WHC and drip loss between 1 and 14 days of storage in superchilled salmon. The two superchilling storage methods showed differences in the development of ice crystals within the superchilled salmon. In non-shell frozen samples, the ice crystals were mainly formed in the extracellular spaces. Fine and well distributed ice crystals were formed in both the intracellular and extracellular spaces in shell frozen samples. Generally, the results found in this study have given more information in the superchilling area. The developed model which can be scaled-up to the industrial level, together with information on the development of the ice crystals, which has a large influence on the quality of the final superchilled food are useful for the industry in estimating the refrigeration requirements for a superchilling system and designing the necessary equipment. In addition, the quality study revealed that the superchilling is practicable if the product is partially freezing fast, with an optimal degree of superchilling (5 - 30 %), good packaging and a strict control of the temperature during superchilled storage.
