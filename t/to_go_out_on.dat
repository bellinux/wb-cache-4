5|$|Celtic {{qualified}} {{from their}} Europa League group. Celtic played Inter Milan {{in the last}} 16 stage of the Europa League, rallying to draw 3–3 at Parkhead from an early 0–2 deficit in a pulsating encounter, then losing 1–0 in Milan <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> aggregate despite a highly credible performance.|$|E
5|$|When {{the album}} {{virtually}} failed to chart, {{the band was}} ready to split but had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> tour to pay off its debts. On 27 January 1986, their final Melbourne concert was recorded and released as the live album The Final Wave in October. The band performed its final concert on 1 February at the Perth Entertainment Centre.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, NBC {{has hired}} {{recently}} laid off investment bankers (Patrick Heusinger, Greg Tuculescu, and Doug Mand) from Lehman Brothers as interns on TGS with Tracy Jordan. Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is invited <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> {{the town with}} them, but finds that he is incapable of keeping up with their lifestyle. Tracy fears that if the public were to learn {{that he no longer}} lives a fast lifestyle, his image would be severely compromised and he would be forced to change from a comedic actor to a dramatic actor. Tracy refuses to allow this to happen, so he buys out Lehman Brothers and sends the interns back to their old jobs on Wall Street.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Ay! there's no {{help for}} it, I suppose,' said Steerforth. 'I have almost {{forgotten}} {{that there is}} anything {{to do in the}} world but <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> tossing <b>on</b> the sea here. I wish there was not.' ...|$|R
5|$|Q2 {{started with}} a busy track once more, {{but many of the}} top drivers elected not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a second timed run after setting {{sufficient}} lap times first time around. The eliminated drivers were determined rather quickly, with the two Renault drivers qualifying 14th and 15th respectively. The two McLarens were next to go out of contention, before Bottas was eliminated for 11th place on the grid, failing to improve on his lap time. Both Force India drivers were the last not to make it into Q3, with Sergio Pérez beating his teammate Hülkenberg to ninth.|$|E
5|$|The new format {{meant that}} all cars {{took to the}} track quickly in Q1, with {{everyone}} setting lap times on the super-soft compound, the fastest tyre available at the event. The two Manor drivers were first to be eliminated, having set only one timed lap each, as were both Haas cars after them, being unable to cross the finishing line in time. The same fate caught out Daniil Kvyat, who qualified 18th. Both Sauber drivers were able <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a second timed lap, but proved too slow to avoid being the last {{to go out in}} Q1, after Renault rookie Jolyon Palmer was able to avoid elimination, setting a faster time {{towards the end of the}} session.|$|E
5|$|Celtic's league title win in 1998 {{gave the}} club their first {{opportunity}} {{to compete in the}} rebranded UEFA Champions League in 1998–99. Two qualifying rounds had first to be negotiated, however. St Patrick's Athletic were knocked out, but Celtic were then paired up against a strong Croatia Zagreb side comprising several players who had helped Croatia to third place at the 1998 World Cup. The first leg took place in Glasgow amidst a row between Celtic players and the club bosses over bonuses. A Darren Jackson goal gave Celtic a 10 win to take over to Zagreb, but an insipid second leg performance in match dominated by Robert Prosinečki saw Celtic beaten 30 <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> aggregate. Only a fine showing from Jonathan Gould in goal saved Celtic from a more emphatic defeat. The club dropped into the UEFA Cup. Portuguese side Vitória de Guimarães were defeated 21 in both legs in the first round, but Celtic crashed out in the second round against Zürich 53 on aggregate as a public row between captain Paul Lambert and managing director Jock Brown raged behind the scenes.|$|E
50|$|They {{looked good}} for {{a place in the}} final when they held Kelantan 1-1 in Kota Bharu in the first leg but came unstuck in the second leg when they lost 3-1 in Kuala Terengganu <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> 2-4 <b>on</b> aggregate.|$|R

5|$|Cogan joined Gillingham in June 2007, being tipped by {{new manager}} Ronnie Jepson {{to fill the}} void left by Matt Jarvis, who had joined Wolverhampton Wanderers. He made his debut for Gillingham in the 3–0 defeat at Watford in the League Cup on 14 August, and scored his first goal for the club in the 3–1 home victory over Leyton Orient on 2 October 2007. Following a string of bad results, Jepson resigned, and Mark Stimson was named as his {{permanent}} replacement in November 2007. Stimson saw Cogan as surplus to requirements, and offered him a chance <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> loan in February 2008. He rejected this initial chance, but subsequently joined Grays Athletic for a month on 14 March 2008, scoring five goals in thirteen Conference National matches. Gillingham released Cogan {{at the end of the}} 2007–08 season, after he made just 21 appearances in all competitions.|$|E
5|$|A {{year later}} in the United States, Charlie learns that Steve has resurfaced under a new {{identity}} and is laundering the gold through a Ukrainian jeweler named Yevhen to finance his lavish lifestyle in Los Angeles. Charlie gathers the team, and also recruits John's daughter Stella, a skilled private safe cracker, offering her {{the chance to get}} revenge on Steve for her father's death. They stake out Steve's mansion, and Stella, disguising herself as a cable technician, is able to map out its interior, allowing them to determine the location of Steve's safe containing the bullion. Coincidentally, Steve, unaware of Stella's identity, offers <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a date with her. Charlie devises a plan using explosives to blow the safe while Stella is on the date with Steve, using three heavily modified Mini Coopers to transport the gold out of the mansion. Charlie enlists the help of Skinny Pete for the explosives and Wrench to make the modifications on the cars. However, {{on the night of the}} planned heist, they find Steve's neighbors are having a party, and the explosives would draw their attention, and they abandon the plan. Stella inadvertently gives away her identity to Steve by using similar phrases her father used, but the team arrives to help protect her. Steve is shocked they survived but taunts them that he has the upper hand.|$|E
5|$|When Tony fires him, Ste starts {{working at}} Chez Chez nightclub as a barman. Ste grows {{suspicious}} of Brendan Brady after he uses Carmel to smuggle drugs. Ste's former co-worker and love interest Rae Wilson (Alice Barlow) returns following a {{stay with her}} ill grandmother. Brendan is jealous of their relationship, so gets Veronica (Lynsey McLaren) to kiss Ste, which Rae witnesses. They later make up after Ste convinces Rae that the kiss meant nothing. Following a drunken night, Ste kisses Brendan, who then throws him out. The next day, Brendan corners Ste and kisses him again. In the club a further day later, Ste follows Brendan to a cellar and moves to kiss him. However, Brendan punches Ste, who falls to the ground. Brendan then makes Ste tell Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh) he was mugged. Ste avoids Brendan, still shaken by his actions. They resume their relationship and Ste tells Amy of his relationship. This prompts Brendan to attack Ste again. Amy realises that Ste is being abused. To hide their relationship, Brendan tells Ste <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a date with Rae. When Rae and Ste finally sleep together, Amy is hospitalised after being involved in a fire. Ste suspects Brendan started the fire. However, he denies it. Ste discovers Brendan's former lover Macca (Drew Dillon) is in hospital after being beaten up by Brendan. Macca and Ste end up kissing. Ste later confides in Dominic Reilly (John Pickard) about Brendan and the fire, however Dom is later charged.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned toward}} the door, weeping. She had not meant <b>to</b> <b>go</b> far--only <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the garden-seat, where she might sit and think. But he saw another purpose in her departure, and a sudden passion fired him. She heard his step as he rose hastily, and she felt his cold fingers upon her wrist.|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, {{there were}} enough moments to {{brighten}} up {{the lives of the}} Cliftonhill faithful - such as an 8-2 League Cup defeat of local rivals Airdrieonians in 1965-66 and a run to the League Cup quarter-finals in 1973-74 (again defeating Airdrie along the way). Rovers took a 2-0 lead in the first leg against Kilmarnock, but lost the 2nd leg 5-2 <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> 5-4 <b>on</b> aggregate.|$|R
50|$|In November 2008, it was {{revealed}} that Blackpool were willing <b>to</b> let Merella <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> loan in order for him to get some first-team experience, after he continued to impress for the club's reserve team.|$|R
25|$|The mill {{owners were}} {{initially}} {{taken by surprise}} by {{the scope of the}} strike. They immediately took the position that these flying squadrons were, in fact, coercing their employees <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> strike.|$|E
25|$|The {{producers}} made {{an exception}} to the taping protocol during the third season, when Pedro Zamora requested that he be allowed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a date without the cameras, because the normal anxieties associated with first dates would be exacerbated by the presence of cameras.|$|E
25|$|He {{announced}} his retirement on 17 October 2007 after a Twenty20 tournament wherein he was New Zealand's leading run-scorer with 163 runs {{at an average of}} 40.75 and a strike-rate of 181. Citing personal reasons and health problems as contributing factors, McMillan said he wanted <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a high.|$|E
50|$|Typically, a bachelorette would {{question}} three bachelors, who were hidden from her view; {{at the end}} of the questioning period, she would choose one <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> with <b>on</b> a date paid for by the show. Occasionally, the roles would be reversed with a man questioning three ladies; other times, a celebrity {{would question}} three players for a date for themselves or for a co-worker or a relative of theirs.|$|R
50|$|After his loan spell expired he {{returned}} <b>to</b> Blackpool, but <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> loan <b>to</b> Macclesfield again on 17 July 2007, and he remained at Moss Rose until January 2008. In May 2008 {{he was offered}} a new contract by Blackpool.|$|R
5|$|When her son Jackson turned 14, Smith {{decided to}} move back to New York. After the impact of these deaths, her friends Michael Stipe of R.E.M. and Allen Ginsberg (whom she had known since her early years in New York) urged her <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the road. She toured briefly with Bob Dylan in December 1995 (chronicled in a book of {{photographs}} by Stipe).|$|R
25|$|Low-voltage circuit {{breakers}} are also made for direct-current (DC) applications, such as DC for subway lines. Direct current requires special breakers because the arc is continuous—unlike an AC arc, which tends <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> each half cycle. A direct current circuit breaker has blow-out coils that generate {{a magnetic field}} that rapidly stretches the arc. Small {{circuit breakers}} are either installed directly in equipment, or are arranged in a breaker panel.|$|E
25|$|Mating {{is mainly}} {{done during the}} month of April, after mating the male has minimal to no role in the new baby spiders life. The female is the main {{caregiver}} for the young, before laying the eggs she will make a silk pouch to protect and give shelter to the eggs, up to 70 eggs can be produced at once. The female will stay in the silk pouch with the eggs, protecting, and waiting for them to hatch. After hatching the mother cares for her new babies and will stay together until they are ready <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> their own. The spider's bite is not poisonous to people but is painful do to their large fangs and wide jaw. However, the bite does leave an itchy, swollen, red bump.|$|E
25|$|Harley Quinn - Completely {{loyal to}} the Joker in her first appearances, even though he mistreats her. She starts to develop {{feelings}} for the Green Goblin, which is briefly hinted at when she accepts Goblin's offer <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a date for coffee {{at the end of}} After Hours. At the end of Happy Hour she had been living with Goblin, but in Zero Hour it was shown that she still pined for the then presumed-dead Joker, much to Goblin's dismay. At the conclusion of Zero Hour she chooses to give up on the Joker and joins the Goblin in the parallel reality that Darkseid intended to house a 'rebooted' version of the world of the combined universe which Stan's Place inhabited. Both she and the Goblin are apparently replaced by their 'reboot' counterparts in the main reality at the end of Zero Hour. The reboot versions appear to have no romantic feelings towards one another. The fate of the original versions, presumably still in the 'rebooted' universe are currently unknown.|$|E

When that lot of fellows {{a year or two}} ago did {{something}} like it, and shot some of the Abbotstoke rabbits, don't you remember how much he said about its being disgraceful, and ordering us never to have anything to do with their gunnery? And he will think it so very bad <b>to</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a lark just now! Oh, I wish I hadn't done it." ...|$|R

25|$|Sharon {{encourages}} Michelle to {{make amends}} with Martin and Ian, but neither of them are interested; Michelle talks to Bex, who says Michelle let herself down and the old Michelle that Bex used {{to look up to}} would hate this Michelle, and that she ruined everything she worked for; Michelle cries in Sharon's arms, saying she no longer knows herself. Ian eventually forgives Michelle but Martin still refuses to speak to her. Michelle attempts to find work in schools, without any luck. Stacey invites Michelle to a family meal but Martin says Michelle is only pretending to care about her family, and tells her that she is not the big sister he used to look up to. Michelle starts community service and hears that Tim wants a divorce, and she tries to avoid the issue. Eventually, Martin and Michelle start to talk again but he is still angry that she has behaved like a teenager.

Whilst travelling to work Michelle meets Tom Bailey (Daniel Casey) on the tube and she eventually gets the courage to ask him <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a date.|$|E
500|$|Rachel informs Monica (Courteney Cox) {{that she}} has managed to find two male nurses who would be willing <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a date with either of them. Monica declines the offer at first, not wanting to {{jeopardize}} her secret relationship with Chandler (Matthew Perry) but when he assumes she is willing {{to go out with}} nurse Dan, Monica decides to date him after all. Chandler in response asks a female nurse <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a date with him; she declines immediately, adding to his embarrassment. After Phoebe gives birth, Chandler approaches Monica in a hallway to ask if she is really going to date Dan. She replies to him that since both of them are just [...] "goofing around", she figured why not [...] "goof around" [...] with Dan too; Chandler asks if Monica had checked up the term in the dictionary, noting the technical definition is “two friends who care a lot about each other, and have amazing sex, and just want to spend more time together”. Monica, smitten by Chandler's words, kisses him and goes to call off her date with Dan.|$|E
500|$|Ed O'Brien {{described}} the lyrics, saying [...] "They were universal. There wasn't a political agenda. It's being human." [...] The song [...] "Bodysnatchers" [...] {{is inspired by}} Victorian ghost stories, the 1972 novel The Stepford Wives and Yorke's feeling of [...] "your physical consciousness trapped {{without being able to}} connect fully with anything else." [...] "Jigsaw Falling into Place" [...] is about a set of observations and different experiences, partly of the chaos witnessed by Yorke when he used <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the weekend in Oxford. Yorke said [...] "The lyrics are quite caustic—the idea of 'before you're comatose' or whatever, drinking yourself into oblivion and getting fucked-up to forget ... is partly this elation. But there's a much darker side." ...|$|E
