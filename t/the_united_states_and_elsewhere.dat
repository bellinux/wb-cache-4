The baseball cap has become a ubiquitous fashion item not only in the United States and Japan, but also in countries where the sport itself is not particularly popular, such as the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|The {{severing}} of workers' hands achieved particular international notoriety. These {{were sometimes}} {{cut off by}} rogue Force Publique soldiers who were made to account for every shot they fired by bringing back {{the hands of their}} victims. These details were recorded by Christian missionaries working in the Congo and caused public outrage when they were made known to the public in the United Kingdom, Belgium, <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere.</b> An international campaign against the Congo Free State began in 1890 and reached its apogee after 1900 under the leadership of the British activist E.

The size of the population decline during the period is the subject of extensive historiographical debate, and there is an open debate as to whether the atrocities constitute genocide.|$|E
5|$|S. iniae {{can cause}} {{opportunistic}} infections in weakened or immunocompromised humans. It is most {{commonly associated with}} bacteremic cellulitis, but {{has been known to}} cause endocarditis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis. The first recognized cases of human infection occurred in Texas in 1991 and in Ottawa in 1994, but the sources of infection were not determined. Human infection with S.iniae was also identified in Toronto between 15 and 20 December 1995, when three Asian patients were admitted to a hospital with cellulitis of the hand after injuring themselves while handling raw fish. All three were found to have bacteremia, initially attributed to Streptococcus uberis, but later correctly identified as S.iniae. In February 1996, a Chinese man was admitted to the same hospital with sepsis one week after preparing a fresh whole tilapia, and was also diagnosed with S.iniae bacteremia. A subsequent epidemiological investigation found other cases in the Toronto area, for a total of nine patients; all were of Asian descent and all had handled raw fish (mostly tilapia) before developing infection. Other cases were later identified in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere</b> in Canada, and have since been reported in Asia (Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore). Asian descent is a common trend in the majority of invasive human cases, but it is unknown whether this is due to inherent differences in immunity or because of cultural differences in the fish preparation which lend themselves to a higher incidence of infection.|$|E
