40|$|One of the {{cardinal}} {{properties of the}} insulation system of the electrical equipment is its electrical strength. Usually it is expressed as value of breakdown voltage. There is not electrical destruction of material under this one. The determination of breakdown voltage exactly is possible only by doing electrical strength test. It is a destructive test on insulation system made by solid material. This test is not suitable for service condition. There isn't only one test method that can complex diagnose the state of insulation system. The utilization of set of diagnostic methods is necessary. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>meaning</b> in monitoring of high voltage insulation system ageing consists in methods based on regular non-destructive diagnostics. The analysis of results from several diagnostic methods is the principle. The issue of such diagnostics is detailed information about ageing process of insulation system of high voltage equipment. The high voltage motor {{is a very important}} element in the production process. A breakdown of its insulating system may cause a loss to the production. Therefore the importance of measuring and testing of its electrical properties is increasing more and more in conjunction with advances of power engineering equipment. This paper describes the use of polarization spectrum determination for diagnostic purposes, especially for insulating systems of high voltage machines. The study of absorption current during accelerated thermal degradation is presented in this paper. Absorptive currents are analyzed. The thermal behavior of a simple model of multi-layer insulation material based on ReMica is described together with recommendation for practical utilization. The activation energy during accelerated thermal stress is calculated and analyzed...|$|E

However, in esoteric cosmology expansion refers to the emanation or unfolding of steadily denser planes or spheres from the spiritual summit, what Greek philosophy called The One, until the lowest and most material world is reached. According to Rosicrucians, another difference {{is that there is no}} such thing as empty or void space. [...] "The space is Spirit in its attenuated form; while matter is crystallized space or Spirit. Spirit in manifestation is dual, that which we see as Form is the negative manifestation of Spirit--crystallized and inert. The positive pole of Spirit manifests as Life, galvanizing the negative Form into action, but both Life and Form originated in Spirit, Space, Chaos! On the other hand, Chaos is not a state which has existed in the past and has now entirely disappeared. It is all around us at the present moment. Were it not that old forms--having outlived their usefulness--are constantly being resolved back into that Chaos, which is also as constantly giving birth to new forms, there could be no progress; the work of evolution would cease and stagnation would prevent the possibility of advancement." ...|$|R

H. pylori –infected patients can develop gastritis, peptic ulcer, stomach cancer or MALT lymphoma. H. pylori infection is defined by WHO like a type I carcinogen, its role in gastric carcinogenesis being supported by the greatest researchers. Objectives: In this study our purpose {{was to determine the}} endoscopic appearances in H. pylori infection quoted in medical literature until now and the frequency of their appearance in our group of interest. Materials and methods: In this study it was made an analytic study in which it was realized a retrospective cohort investigation at the Emergency Central Military and University Hospital “Dr. Carol Davila” Bucharest, gastroenterology branch –endoscopic department between 18. 12. 2012 - 21. 08. 2013 on 1694 patients between 18 and 92 years old, with the medium age of 55 years old. As a diagnostic method for H. pylori infection we used superior digestive endoscopy during which were taken biopsies and it was made a fast urease test.

40|$|This article {{examines}} a rethinking {{of the historic}} Marikana tragedy of 16 August 2012, as encoded in the eNCA documentary film The Marikana Massacre: Through the Lens. My approach {{is in the form}} of commentary on the act, scene, actor, agent and agency pertaining to the way the Marikana massacre is selectively revived in the documentary film. I make these comments in order to scaffold discussions of the documentary producers’ poíésis and praxis giving shape to their narrative. The presencing and absencing of the documentary are discussed in making the case for a need to analyse carefully the background of the Marikana shootings and the situation in which they occurred, in much the same way as it is necessary to explore the producers’ purpose and narrative in selecting to produce the documentary as they did. The study argues that the producers of the documentary film chose to narrate the small-person plight of the killed Marikana miners, security guards and police officers by silencing issues around other main actors one may categorise as symbolic of big-person state power, only to enrich <b>the</b> supposed <b>bigger</b> <b>meaning</b> contingent upon <b>the</b> audience’s pre-existing knowledge of the context of the incidents. In this way the illusory objectivity of the narration is strengthened towards a more cogent correlation with what obtains in the real world of nearly two decades of post-apartheid South Africa.

40|$|Shadow is a {{place which}} is {{protected}} from the sunbeams or some other source of light. Namely, the shadow is nothing more but a relation between the human (subject, figure, and form), the sun (the light) and the wall (blacktop, concrete, and brick). That is, {{the appearance of the}} shadow is connected with the proportional lining of these three factors, which means if one of them is missing then the shadow is gone. But also if one of these factors is with inadequate quality then the shadow is weak, sometimes even unnoticeable. Taking into consideration the urban lifestyle, <b>the</b> shadow has <b>bigger</b> <b>meaning.</b> It is shadowing, crossover between the black and white, a shade that refines life and after all refines the person. The fact that says the brighter the sun the deeper the shadow is well known. And when there is no sun there are no shadows. The effect that is made with lightning from below, it is mostly used for lightning landscape elements. This effect gives shinny silhouette to the object {{as a result of the}} higher contrast between the lines of the lightning and the dark backgrounds. ...|$|R

40|$|Performance metrics are {{a driving}} force in many fields of work today. The field of {{constructive}} neural networks is no different. In this field, the popular measurement metrics (resultant network size, test set accuracy) are difficult to maximise, given their dependence on several varied factors, of which the mostimportant is the dataset to be applied. This project set out with the intention to minimise the number of hidden units installed into a resource allocating network (RAN) (Platt 1991), whilst increasing the accuracy by means of application of competitive learning techniques. Three datasets were used for evaluation of the hypothesis, one being a time-series set, {{and the other two}} being more general regression sets. Many trials were conducted during the period of this work, {{in order to be able}} to prove conclusively the discovered results. Each trial was different in only one respect from another in an effort to maximise the comparability of the results found. Four metrics were recorded for each trial- network size (per training epoch, and final), test and training set accuracy (again, per training epoch and final), and overall trial runtime. The results indicate that the application of competitive learning algorithms to the RAN results in a considerable reduction in network size (and therefore the associated reduction in processing time) across the vast majority of the trials run. Inspection of the accuracy related metrics indicated that using this method offered no real difference to that of the originalimplementation of the RAN. As such, the positive network-size results found are only half of <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> picture, <b>meaning</b> there is scope for future work to be done to increase the test set accuracy...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} the Latin {{ablative}} has been very exhaustive in the linguistic tradition: in order to explain <b>the</b> <b>big</b> amount of <b>meanings</b> and functions that this case can have, grammarians have done a huge work, trying to reach an original, simple, and unespecific meaning from which the different meanings could be drawn. Recent studies on this subject have shown a new perception {{and understanding of the}} case. On the one hand, the etymology of the case shows that two Indo-European cases have merged in this case: the ablative and the instrumental singular, blending together their markers, against the traditional opinions —the syncretism of three cases: instrumental, ablative and locative. On the other hand, new grammatical approaches show how frequent is for a marker to develop Semantic Functions that are related, as Cause and Source, for example avoiding rigid conceptions of semantics. In addition, new methods of representation, as Haspelmath’s Semantic Maps, allow us to see how our semantic conception puts together and relates Semantic Functions that didn’t seem so close. Los nuevos enfoques lingüísticos que se aplican a las lenguas modernas llevan aplicándose algún tiempo también a las lenguas de corpus, como el latín, el griego y el sánscrito entre otras. En el caso de la explicación de la evolución del ablativo latino, nuevas teorías lingüísticas, como la lingüística cognitiva o los mapas semánticos, permiten explicar de una manera más coherente su funcionamiento y evolución, desde el Indoeuropeo hasta el latín tardío y las lenguas romances...|$|R
