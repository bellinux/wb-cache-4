5|$|An {{important}} aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, {{as in the case}} of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, {{as in the case of}} games, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with stage magic. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>stories,</b> present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} centuries of Islam, the sīra {{literature}} was taken less seriously {{compared to the}} hadiths. In Umayyad times, storytellers (qāṣṣ, pl. quṣṣāṣ) used <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>stories</b> of Muhammad and earlier prophets in private gatherings and mosques, given they obtain permission from the authorities. Many of these storytellers are now unknown. After the Umayyad period, their reputation deteriorated because of their inclination to exaggerate and fantasize, and for relying on the Isra'iliyat. Thus they were banned from preaching at mosques. In later periods, however, works of sīra became more prominent. More recently, western historical criticism and debate concerning sīra have elicited a defensive attitude from some Muslims who wrote apologetic literature defending its content.|$|E

The adoption of Javanese Mataram kejawen culture by Sundanese aristocrats was probably the remnant of Mataram influence over the Priangan region during the reign of expansive Sultan Agung. While main characters from Ramayana and Mahabharata are similar with wayang kulit purwa version of Central Java, some of punakawan (servant also jester) were rendered in Sundanese names and characteristics, such as Cepot or Astrajingga as Bagong, Dawala or Udel as Petruk. Wayang golek purwa has become the most popular form of wayang golek today and the most famous puppeteer family is the Sunarya family which has produced several generations of stellar performers.|$|E

25|$|Ximenez-Fatio House Museum {{is one of}} the best-preserved {{and most}} {{authentic}} Second Spanish Period (1783-1821) residential buildings in St. Augustine, Florida. In 1973, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. It was designated a Florida Heritage Landmark in 2012. The museum complex sits just south of the city's central Plaza de la Constitución at 20 Aviles Street (formerly Hospital Street), the oldest archaeologically documented street in the United States. It is located at the center of Old Town, the city's oldest continuously occupied community. Since 1939, the property has been privately owned and managed by The National Society of The Colonial Dames of America in The State of Florida (NSCDA-FL). Through their efforts, it was restored and interpreted to reflect its function as a fashionable boarding house during Florida's first tourist boom, which began after 1821. The property is a historic house museum, furnished and presented <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>stories</b> of the visitors who lodged there, the women who owned and managed it, and how people lived during Florida's territorial period.|$|E
