Shortly afterwards he fled to British-occupied New York; he would never return to his home along the Saw Mill.|$|E
5|$|Asexual {{organizations}} and other Internet resources {{play a key}} role in informing people about asexuality. The lack of research makes it difficult for doctors to understand the causation. Like with any sexual orientation, most people who are asexual are self-identified. This can be a problem when asexuality is mistaken for an intimacy or relationship problem or for other symptoms that do not define asexuality. There is also a significant population that either does not understand or does not believe in asexuality, which adds to the importance of these organizations <b>to</b> <b>inform</b> <b>the</b> general population; however, due to the lack of scientific fact on the subject, what these groups promote as information is often questioned.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1944, Ron Jeffery, an agent of British and Polish intelligence in occupied Poland, eluded the Abwehr and travelled to London with a report from Poland to the British government. His efforts were at first highly regarded, but subsequently ignored by the British, which a disillusioned Jeffery attributed to the treachery of Kim Philby and other high-ranking communist agents entrenched in the British system. Jeffery tried <b>to</b> <b>inform</b> <b>the</b> British government about the Katyn massacre, but was as a result released from the Army.|$|E

5|$|Julia's suspicions {{regarding}} Macrinus' {{involvement in}} the death of Caracalla led to her championing the case of her grandson, Elagabalus, as the rightful emperor.
