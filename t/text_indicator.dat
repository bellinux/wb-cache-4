40|$|Background: Quality {{of health}} care {{includes}} some degree of services provided to individuals and communities to {{increase the likelihood of}} desired results and are updated in accordance with professional knowledge. To assess the quality of services provided in hospitals, indicators and performance standards are needed to be identified, because these indicators are the structure of the hospital evaluation. This study aimed to determine the performance indicators in general- public hospitals in area of quality and effectiveness and prioritization of these indicators. Materials and Methods: This descriptive-qualitative and practical research was done through a systematic review of literature and data were obtained from the hospital authorities. In order to prioritize public hospital performance indicators, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used and the results were analyzed by the Expert Choice software. Results: In the field of quality and effectiveness, 73 performance indicators were considering at various <b>texts.</b> <b>Indicators</b> such as the rate of hospital infections (100 %), the incidence of hospital events (72 %), Net hospital mortality(63 %), Percentage of patients' satisfaction(53 %) selected as key performance indicators.

In a first step, basic color segmentation and shape classification is done {{for the purpose of}} detecting possible rectangular planes. Every detected plane is extracted from the original image and then reoriented. Chrominance and luminance histogram analysis and adaptive segmentation is carried out, and connected components labeling and position clustering is finally done for the arrangement of the different characters on the panel. Special emphasis has been placed on the adaptive segmentation. Experimental results have showed that following steps strongly depends on correct separation between the background and foreground objects of the panel. Moreover, OCR systems are highly sensitive to noise, and we have put special attention into it in order that the OCR system could be able to recognize characters properly.

Quality indicators are used for external accountability and hospital comparison. As clinical quality indicators are computed in a decentralised manner by the hospitals themselves, reproducibility of the formalisation method is essential to ensure the comparability of calculated values. Thus, we performed a case study to investigate the reproducibility of CLIF. Eight participants formalised the same sample quality indicator with the help of a web-based indicator-authoring tool that facilitates the application of CLIF.

In the proposed procedure termed as permuted sparse coding, we solve ΠB = AC + O simultaneously for an approximately diagonal C and the permutation Π bringing the indicator functions into correspondence. To cope with imperfectly matching regions, we relax the surjectivity of the permutation and absorb the mismatches into a row-wise sparse outlier matrix O. For visualization purposes, the coloring of the regions is consistent as after {{the application of the}} permutation. Correspondence is shown between a synthetic TOSCA and scanned SCAPE shape.

In the skill of writing for instance, at least students have to master not only vocabulary but also grammar well. In this case, verb tenses have essentials role, because they tell readers when actions are taking place. Careful and accurate use of tenses is important to clear writing. For instance, if the verbs in a passage refer to actions occurring at past actions, then the past tense is definitely needed to be used. Based on the 2006 English Curriculum (Depdiknas: 24), the standard of competence of English for Junior High School is spoken and written by using kinds of language which suitable fluently and accurately using common utterances in the daily life.

The specific objective {{of this study was}} to characterize, using a comprehensive set of indicators, the quality of the vocabulary produced by Chilean 4 th grade students. Based on a national writing survey, a sample of 2056 texts written by 685 students was collected (narrative, persuasive, and informative texts). Current literature defines lexical quality as a composite of diverse factors that, while distinct, are interrelated. To represent the properties of the vocabulary, a set of indicators were selected: (a) lexical diversity; (b) lexical sophistication; and (c) lexical density. Using multilevel modeling (students and schools as levels 1 and 2) to explain a global writing score we found that diversity was a significant determinant for narrative and persuasive texts, density was a significant determinant for the three genres and sophistication was a significant determinant for narrative and expository <b>text.</b> In addition, <b>indicators</b> related to gender and socioeconomic conditions were only significant determinants of narrative stories. The parts of speech most often used also varied according to the purpose of each text. In all genres, words had a short extension and were very sensitive to the input presented in the stimuli.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relation between}} the publisher, editor and contents of the trade union press. It fo-cuses on in which degree the publisher determines the editorial content and on the significance of the edito-rial responsibility conditions. The examination starts from the journalistic paradigm ‘the news paradigm’. According to this paradigm the journalist is serving the public and therefore has to be independent and critical. The examination is in two parts. The first part {{examines the}} editors understanding of how much the pub-lishers determine the editorial content. Part two is a content analysis, which examines in which degree and in what ways the publishers are exposed in the magazines. The exposition of the publishers is taken as an indicator of the publishers’ determination of the editorial content. The conclusion is that the editors experience a distinct grade of self-determine and that the journalism is critical towards the publishers. There is a tendency towards less experience of self-determination on the magazines where the publisher is responsible, than on the magazines, where the editor is responsible. The content analysis shows that the <b>texts</b> contain several <b>indicators</b> that the publishers determine a great amount of the editorial content. However, this is most distinct in the magazine where the editor is responsible. The two parts show that there is not any clear-cut connection between the editorial responsibility conditions and how much the publishers determine the editorial content. The examination also indicates that the magazines are raising the publishers profile and that the editors at the same time seek to make journalism that is critical towards the publisher. This is interpreted as the edi-tors attempt to balance between two different expectations to the journalism: the publishers wish to get the profile raised in the magazines and the journalists wish to serve the public and be critical towards the pub-lisher. In the paper the possibility to solve this balance problem by thinking journalism differently is discussed. It is argued that the journalists have to see themselves as part of the trade unions instead of detached spectators. And it is suggested that the journalists and the leaders of the trade unions cooperate on concrete and spe-cific guidelines for the journalism in the trade union press...|$|R

40|$|In this Working Paper {{we present}} a new dataset (ImPol) {{containing}} information that allows {{for the construction of}} quantitative indicators to measure the entry dimension of immigration policies. The main goal of the paper is to document the dataset and to explain each of the steps we made in order to convert the qualitative information contained in various legal texts dealing with admission policies into quantitative data. The chosen approach, which relies on legal texts (policy inputs) rather than on policy outputs such as the number of visa applications, also represents a contribution to the methodological discussion about challenges in constructing policy measures that has already received considerable attention in the area of migrant integration policies. 1 However, as the Working Paper focuses on providing technical information on the construction of the ImPol dataset, it does not discuss conceptual and methodological advantages and disadvantages of using legal texts for measurement of policies. 2 The ImPol dataset was originally conceived as a tool to complement the individual survey data collection carried out {{in the context of the}} MAFE‐Senegal Project. For this reason, the information collected so far is limited to France, Italy and Spain, which are the main destinations of Senegalese migrants in Europe, and focuses predominantly on the period from the 1960 s until 2008. The type of information contained in the ImPol dataset can be utilized for a wide range of both contextual and statistical analyses. In addition, the dataset largely remains as work in progress, since both new indicators and new destination countries can be added to the existing one. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data collection and main sources used; Section 3 lists the indicators included in the dataset and the reasons underlying their selection; Section 4 explains how we converted qualitative information in the consulted legal <b>texts</b> into quantitative <b>indicators,</b> dealing with issues of categorical scaling and coding. Section 5 provides examples for aggregation of individual indicators into variables capturing a selected dimension of immigration policies. Finally, Section 5 discusses the multiple methodological challenges involved in this type of exercise, with particular attention to the need to adapt the selection of the relevant indicators and the definition of the score thresholds to the specific subject of analysis.

Myös opettajien jaksaminen on noussut keskustelun valokeilaan. Tällä tutkimuksella selvitetään sitä, mikä tekee opettajasta selviytyjän? Vastauksia haettiin kysymyksillä: Mitkä tekijät opettajassa itsessään selittävät opettajana selviytymistä? Mitkä tekijät ympäristössä selittävät opettajan työssä selviytymistä? Tämän laadullisen tutkimuksen tavoitteena on kuvata todellisuutta monipuolisesti. Tutkimuksessa pyritään ymmärtämään ja tulkitsemaan opettajien kokemuksia selviytymisestä ja sitä kautta pääsemään mahdollisimman syvälle selviytymisen kysymyksiin. Tutkimusaineisto koostuu opettajien omakohtaisista selviytymistarinoista sekä tarkentavasta ja täydentävästä aineistosta. Opettajuus on ajankohtainen tutkimuskohde. Sitä on kartoitettu muuttuneen työnkuvan, yhteisöllisyyden, jaksamisen ja uupumisen näkökulmasta. Vähemmälle tutkimukselle ovat jääneet ne tekijät, jotka tekevät opettajasta selviytyjän. Selviytyjä etsii aktiivisesti keinoja vaikuttaa fyysiseen ja sosiaaliseen ympäristöönsä. Selviytyminen on jotakin enemmän kuin pelkkä jaksaminen. Selviytymiseen liittyy verbi tehdä, jaksamiseen verbi olla. Opettajan työhön kohdistuu monenlaisia paineita ja vaatimuksia. Opettajalta edellytetään moniosaamista. Tutkijoiden ja koulutuspoliittisten päättäjien pitäisi kiinnittää huomiota siihen, miksi yhdet koulut opettajineen menestyvät, kun taas toiset taantuvat. Selviytymisen taustalla ovat usean yksittäisen tekijän muodostamat kategoriat: itsensä kehittäminen, työyhteisön yhteisöllisyys, persoonallisuus, holistinen elämänkatsomus ja ulkopuolinen tuki. Tärkeimmiksi yksittäisiksi tekijöiksi opettajan selviytymisessä osoittautuivat 1) halu itsensä kehittämiseen, 2) persoonalliset ominaisuudet, jotka edesauttavat selviytymistä, 3) holistinen elämänkatsomus ja 4) mahdollisuus keskustella jonkun kanssa työhön liittyvistä asioista joko työyhteisössä tai lähipiirissä. Työyhteisö on opettajan selviytymisen kannalta merkityksellinen. Jos opettaja ei saa työyhteisöltään tukea, nousee ulkopuolinen tuki tärkeäksi selviytymistä tukevaksi tekijäksi. Tutkimuksessa erottui neljä yksilöllisyyttä korostavaa selviytyjäprofiilia. 1) Yhteisöllis-holistisen selviytyjän profiilissa korostuvat yhteisön merkitys ja kokonaisvaltaisuus. 2) Yhteisön tukeman itsenäisen opettajan profiilissa painottuvat itsetuntemus sekä yhteisön ja rehtorin merkitys opettajan selviytymisessä. 3) Interpersoonallisen reflektoijan profiili on laajin, sillä siinä korostuvat yhteisöllisyys, ystävät ja koulun ulkopuolinen elämä. 4) Intrapersoonallisen itsensä kehittäjän profiilissa painottuvat yksilön itsetuntemus, kyky tunnistaa omat tarpeet ja toiveet sekä niiden tyydyttäminen asiaankuuluvalla tavalla. Opettajan selviytymispolku korostaa opettajan persoonallisista ominaisuuksista vuorovaikutustaitoja, myönteisyyttä, ammatti-identiteettiä, luovuutta ja itseluottamusta. Opettajankoulutuksen osalta mallissa painottuvat vuorovaikutustaidot, yhteistyötaidot, luovuus ja opettajuuden rajat. Työyhteisö vahvistaa parhaiten opettajan selviytymistä yhteisöllisyyden, selkeän ja toimivan toiminta- ja keskustelukulttuurin sekä uutta opettajaa tukevan toiminnan kautta. Tutkimuksen tuloksia voidaan hyödyntää laajasti muillakin työaloilla. Tuloksia on mahdollista käyttää myös työn, työyhteisön ja -kulttuurin kehittämisessä. Opettajan selviytymistä tukevaa mallia voidaan käyttää yleisemmin työelämässä jaksamisen edistämiseen. Tuloksista on apua myös työntekijöitä valittaessa, täydennyskoulutuksen suunnittelussa ja ammatinvalinnan ohjauksessa. Tulokset palvelevat opettajankoulutuslaitosten valintakriteereitä ja myös ohjaavat koulutuksen sisältöjen muuttamista. What makes {{a teacher}} a survivor? This study is {{concerned}} with how teachers cope; in other words, how teachers themselves cope in their environments, at work and in life. An examination of coping necessitates {{an examination of the}} risk factors of coping. What kinds of teachers find their work meaningful and important and derive pleasure from being a teacher year after year? What are such teachers coping strategies? Data collection and analysis were guided by the following research questions: What makes a teacher a survivor? *?What is it in the teacher which enables coping? *What is it in the environment which accounts for the teacher coping at work? Teacher identity is a topical research theme, which has been studied from the perspective of changes in job description, communality, well-being and burnout. Teachers personal characteristics, the success factors enabling coping have been less researched. The significance of basic and continuing education for teachers has likewise not been researched from the perspective of coping. Our society has become more hectic and unstable; change is a part of life. The teacher s work is fraught with pressures and demands. The teacher is required to possess a wide range of skills. The differences between schools and teachers are vast. Researchers and decision-makers in education policy should consider why some schools and their teachers prosper while others regress. Individuals adept at coping are active in seeking ways to exert influence over their physical and social environments. Coping is more than mere scraping through. Coping is about doing; scraping through is about being. The study is based on qualitative data. Qualitative research aims to describe reality from various perspectives. My aim is to understand and interpret the informants coping experiences and thereby elucidate the phenomenon as profoundly as possible. This is a narrative study, as the data comprise narratives of significant events in the informants lives. It is therefore a piece of life history research. The aim was to build a model of factors conducive to teachers coping. I see it as a biographical study based on Grounded Theory. The data consist of the personal coping stories of ten teachers. The coping histories are constructed from the teachers reflective essays and biographical interviews, likewise from written questions and interviews to elicit further information. The teachers e-mails, text messages and telephone conversations with them constitute the complementary component of the data. Further discussions with two male teachers served to introduce a male perspective into the study. Teachers coping is to be studied holistically, taking into account the entire life course and personality. The Straussian Grounded Theory analysis involved three stages: 1) open coding, 2) axial coding and 3) selective coding. The stages are not entirely separable and constitute an analytical whole. In the first stage of the analysis I divided the data into parts, scrutinizing the <b>text</b> for codes (<b>indicators)</b> as the basis of preliminary concepts and categories. In the analysis I deliberately tried to confine myself to the stories recounted by the teachers. The tentative coping categories took shape by combining the codes and the concepts derived from them. In the second stage I combined categories close to each other so as to form five coping categories and their subcategories. These subcategories are also referred to in the text as factors conducive to coping. At this point I created links between the categories. In the selective coding stage a core category was chosen. I focused on scrutinizing and validating the connections between coping and its categories. In so doing I ensured that the analysis, interpretation and presentation of the categories met the requirements of Grounded Theory research. At this point I continued working with the categories needing further analysis and development. It is my conclusion that what underlies a teacher s coping are categories consisting of numerous individual factors: self-improvement, communality of the work organization, personality, holistic view of life and external support. The most salient individual factors in teachers coping emerged as 1) desire for selfimprovement, 2) personal characteristics conducive to coping, 3) holistic view of life and 4) opportunity to discuss the work either at the workplace or with significant others. The work community is significant to teachers coping; it may be supportive of coping, but it may also constitute a risk to coping. A teacher lacking the support of the work community is in greater need of support from outside. Four coping profiles stressing individuality emerged from the data, namely social-holistic, independent with work community support, interpersonalreflective and intrapersonal self-improving. The social-holistic profile stresses the importance of the work community and a holistic conception. The independent profile with work community support attaches importance to selfknowledge as well as the work community and the head teacher. The interpersonal-reflective profile is the most extensive, emphasizing communality, friends and life outside school. The intrapersonal self-improving profile highlights the individual s self-knowledge, ability to identify own needs and hopes and their appropriate satisfaction. Among the personal characteristics along a teacher s coping path the emphasis is on interactive skills, being positive, professional identity, creativity and self-reliance. Regarding teacher education the model emphasizes interactive skills, co-operation skills, creativity and the limits of the teacher identity. The work organization can best promote the teacher s coping through communality, a clear and functioning culture of collaboration and induction support for new teachers. The model resulting from the research findings and conclusions thereon to support teachers coping can be used to promote teachers work well-being, through continuing education among others. The findings can be applied in the further development of the teacher s work, work community and school culture. They also {{have a role to play}} in the student selection criteria of teacher education departments and in curriculum development. They will also be an aid to employee recruitment, continuing education design and careers guidance...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2015 İnsanoğlu geçmişten beri düşüncesini ifade etmek için çeşitli araçlar kullandı. Bunlar dil, resim, yazı vb. gibi göstergeler içeren araçlardı; bu göstergeler aracılığıyla hem iletişim sağlanmakta, hem de içinde yaşanılan dünya anlamlandırılmaktaydı. Geçmişten beri filozofların da üzerinde durduğu bu konu, 20. yüzyılda bir bilim olarak ortaya çıkarak göstergebilim olarak adlandırılmıştır. Özellikle bu tarihten sonra bu alanda birçok felsefeci konuya eğilerek, çeşitli öğretiler ortaya koymuşlar ve göstergebilimin gelişmesine katkıda bulunmuşlardır. Yapısı gereği birçok bilimle ilişki kurabilen ve farklı kaynaklardan beslenebilen göstergebilim, disiplinler arası bir rol kazanmıştır. Bizim çalışmamız kapsamında da göstergebilim temel alınarak, bilimsel bazı terimler açıklanacak, kuramcılardan ve yaptıklarından tarihsel bir süreç içerisinde bahsedilecektir. Buradan yola çıkılarak mimarlıkta gösterge, mimarlık ve yazı ilişkisi açıklanmaya çalışılacak; Mimar Sinan camilerinde dönemin tasavvur anlayışının yazıyla nasıl ifade bulduğuna bakılacaktır. Günümüzde mimarlık yapılarının da birer iletişim biçimi olarak kabul edildiğini görmekteyiz. Dil, yazı ve diğer iletişim simgeleri kadar yapılar da birer simge olma özelliği taşımaktadırlar. Mekân adeta bir dil gibi, kendini oluşturan tüm öğelerle bir dizge haline gelir. Yalnız mekân sadece yapısal bir takım araçları ve kendi maddesel gerçekliklerini ifade etmez. Mekân, içinde bulunduğu toplumsal yapıyı, dini inanışı, kültürü, ekonomiyi, iktidarı, teknolojiyi, bir takım soyut kavramları ve diğer şeyleri de içinde barındırır ve temsil eder. Bu da devrin kozmoloji anlayışının yapıya aktarılması ve simgelerle ifade edilmesi demektir. Mimarlıkta, simgesel içerikli binalar deyince ilk akla gelen ise dini bir yapı olan ibadet mekânları olmaktadır. Dini yapılar, ait oldukları toplumun inanışlarına, toplumun ortak değerlerine ve ait olduğu zamana göre taşıdığı sembollerde farklılaşabilirler. Bu simgeselliği de yazıyla ve çeşitli tasarımsal elemanlarla göstermektedirler. Özellikle İslam mimarisinde resim ve çeşitli figüratif elemanların dini açıdan yasak olması sebebiyle İslam dini ibadet yapılarında yazı ve soyut bir takım süslemeler ön plana çıkmıştır. Yazının ön plana çıkma sebebi ise Kur’an-ı Kerim ve Hz. Muhammed’in sözleri olan hadis-i şeriflerdir. İbadet mekânında bulunan yazıyı okuyan kişi, doğrudan Allah’ın ve Hz. Muhammed’in muhatabı olur. Böylece insanların üzerinde yazıyla oluşturulan ilahi bir etki bırakılır. Çalışmamızda cami mimarisinde kozmolojik boyutu, kavram-simge ilişkisiyle ele alıp, cami iç ve dış mekânında yer alan İslam yazı sanatından faydalanarak, kavram-simge irdelemesi yapacağız. Yazılardaki kozmoloji tasavvurunun anlam boyutunu (kavramı), bu boyutun anlam kattığı caminin yapısal elemanlarının ise simgeyi meydana getirdiğini görmekteyiz. Göstergeyi oluşturmak için gerekli olan kavram-simge, yani gösteren-gösterilen ilişkisini, camideki yazılar ve yapı elemanlarıyla oluşturacağız. Mimar Sinan dönemi cami yapılarının bu zamana kadar hep tasarımsal ve yapısal olarak incelendiğini görmekteyiz. Dönemin dünya tasavvurunu ifade eden ve camilerde bunun karşılığını arayan bir çalışma ise henüz yapılmamıştır. Çalışmamızda amacımız, caminin biçim öğelerini ve yazı içeriklerini ayrı ayrı ve birlikte ele alarak, aralarındaki ilişkilerin neler olduğunu gözler önüne sermek ve mimarinin nasıl bir kozmolojik simgesellik barındırdığını incelemek olacaktır. We, humans, {{employ a}} great variety of tools to express our thoughts. These tools, like language, images, and <b>texts</b> are <b>indicators.</b> We {{communicate}} through them and make sense of the world. Their scientific study has recently been named semiotics, which is related to many other sciences due to its communicative structure. Hence, semiotics gained an interdisciplinary nature. Our study is based on the definition and function of symbol as delineated in semiotics. Our objective is to establish a relationship between architectural symbol and text in terms of the methodology developed in semiotics. Today, we understand that buildings can also be regarded as communication tools and even icons. These properties are expressed in language, scripts and other communication tools. Thus, space becomes a system with all its constituent elements in similar to language. It can symbolize social structure, religion, culture, economy, government, power, technology, and other things. Furthermore, buildings that create space represent the cosmological conceptions of their era by several symbols. But, we should never disregard the fact that space also expresses corporeality of the buildings as material objects. The city, architecture and art, of course, have a special kind of communication. Even products of architecture and artworks constitute communication tools on their own. Because, form, material, content and so on vary according to the artist that created it or the society and the era in which the work was created. In this way, communication was created with a formed language between the ages through signs. Without doubt, we are not able to understand easily the language that differs among the periods, because of looking at the past era from today. We know all of the historical background and the life of the society. Scale, light and shadow, shape, proportion, color, texture and material create an architectural language and give us clues about these. Moreover, all of these indicate sign feature for us whereby we try to understand concept, ideas and feelings in the past. Architects, firstly, take construction techniques and material selection of their period into consideration when creating a building. Then, they make comments and give shapes appropriate for the structure of the program. Diversity of architectural program and original reviews of designer also affect the design and generally the final product reflects the mentality of that era. Thus, we also take the meaning and content of the work into consideration reviewing the structure. Subsequently, we try to make sense of feelings, comments, conception and philosophy of life about the form of the structure. Architectural works not only reflect their cosmological conception and the characteristics of the period, but also testify the history exactly like a witness who has survived. This witness consists of a several physical properties of works. Namely, building techniques tell us about construction techniques, materials, proportions and dimensions which are themselves buildings. Further, philosophy of life and religion are also reflected in the work with the architectural design. Objective data in these testimonies are measurable, physical and tangible indicators in the building. Subjective data can be considered as abstract indicators that reflect the worldview of the period in which the building was constructed. So to speak, this testimony is integrated with architectural design. These indicators seen as an inseparable part are actually located within a string. The coming together of the strings has been so natural and seamless. Thence, this case does not appear clearly. Therefore, the architecture created in its own language with these strings which bring the indicators together provides the communication between the ages. Architecture has been a tool integrated with human life, which develops and changes with it. Buildings have become a language integrating architecture and cosmological conception of the era in time. Transmission between generations is provided via self-composed language. The main tool of this language is to give form. Architect or users leave their culture, faith, religion, life style and traditions in the society as signs to the building. Namely, they are transferred to the architectural buildings via specific indicators. In this way, indicators in the building shed light on this society. When we mention the context of symbolism in architecture, first of all, religious buildings come to our mind as a worship place. Religious buildings differentiate according to faith of communities, common values of society, and time with symbols that have. This symbolism is represented by the writings and various conceptual elements. Images and various figurative elements are prohibited in terms of religion, which affected this situation especially in Islamic architecture. Therefore, text and some abstract figurative decorations come to the fore in Islamic worship buildings. The reason why text comes to the fore is holy Qur’an and the words of Muhammad named hadith. The person reading the text in the places of worship directly becomes an interlocutor with Allah and the Prophet Muhammad's words. Thence, a divine influence created with text is left on the people The buildings using symbolism most commonly have been the mosques in the geography of Turkey. These buildings due to the worship space have maintained their importance since the adoption of Islam by Turks. Therefore, mosque has an important place {{in the lives of the}} Turks. There are many symbols transmitted over the mosques and these symbols are located in different parts of the building. Dome has attracted the most attention in this context. It creates a unity with the construction, on the written texts and adornments. It covers up the worship space and thus brings subjectivity in the mosque architecture. Especially, it reached to peak point with the effect of Mimar Sinan in 16 th century. Written inscription on the dome and on the other architectural elements reflect cosmological understanding of the period. Moving from this point, we have determined the boundaries of this study as the cosmological thought in the 16 th century Ottoman mosque architecture. We have discussed the cosmological thought in mosque architecture via concept-icon|$|R
