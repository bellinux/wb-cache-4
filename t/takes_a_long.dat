5|$|The {{wood turtle}} <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{time to reach}} sexual maturity, has a low {{fecundity}} (ability to reproduce), but has a high adult survival rate. However, the high survival rates are not true of juveniles or hatchlings. Although males establish hierarchies, they are not territorial. The wood turtle becomes sexually mature between 14 and 18 years of age. Mating activity among wood turtles peaks {{in the spring and}} again in the fall, although it is known to mate throughout the portion of the year they are active. However, it has been observed mating in December. In one rare instance, a female wood turtle hybridized with a male Blanding's turtle.|$|E
5|$|The {{writers of}} The Simpsons {{went on strike}} {{together}} with the Writers Guild of America {{at the end of}} 2007. The broadcasting of The Simpsons was not affected by the strike. Since it <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to produce an episode of an animated show, the episodes are written up to a year in advance. So the strike would have had to go on for a while for the show to have run out of new episodes. Production of season 20 was further delayed because of contract negotiations with the six main voice actors. The dispute was resolved, and the actors' salary was raised to $400,000 per episode. The delay in production has caused the planned 22 episodes to be shortened to 20.|$|E
5|$|High-energy gamma-ray photons {{initially}} released with fusion {{reactions in}} the core are almost immediately absorbed by the solar plasma of the radiative zone, usually after traveling only a few millimeters. Re-emission happens in a random direction and usually at a slightly lower energy. With this sequence of emissions and absorptions, it <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time for radiation to reach the Sun's surface. Estimates of the photon travel time range between 10,000 and 170,000years. In contrast, it takes only 2.3 seconds for the neutrinos, which account for about 2% of the total energy production of the Sun, to reach the surface. Because energy transport in the Sun {{is a process that}} involves photons in thermodynamic equilibrium with matter, the time scale of energy transport in the Sun is longer, on the order of 30,000,000 years. This is the time it would take the Sun to return to a stable state, if the rate of energy generation in its core were suddenly changed.|$|E

5|$|Procellariids {{begin to}} attend their nesting colony around one month prior to laying. Males will arrive first and attend the colony more {{frequently}} than females, partly {{in order to protect}} a site or burrow from potential competitors. Prior to laying there is a period known as the pre-laying exodus in which both the male and female are away from the colony, building up reserves in order to lay and undertake the first incubation stint respectively. This pre-laying exodus can vary in length from 9 days (as in the Cape petrel) to around 50 days in Atlantic petrels. All procellariids lay one egg per pair per breeding season, in common {{with the rest of the}} Procellariiformes. The egg is large compared to that of other birds, weighing 6–24% of the female's weight. Immediately after laying the female goes back to sea to feed while the male takes over incubation. Incubation duties are shared by both sexes in shifts that vary in length between species, individuals and even the stage of incubation. The longest recorded shift was 29 days by a Murphy's petrel from Henderson Island; the typical length of a gadfly petrel stint is between 13 and 19 days. Fulmarine petrels, shearwaters and prions tend to have shorter stints, averaging between 3 and 13 days. Incubation <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, from 40 days for the smaller species (such as prions) to around 55 days for the larger species. The incubation period is longer if eggs are abandoned temporarily; procellariid eggs are resistant to chilling and can still hatch after being left unattended for a few days.|$|E

25|$|While the Hudson Tunnel Project {{would double}} the number of tracks under the Hudson River, it would not result in an {{increase}} in rail capacity due to constraints at Penn Station. Penn Station operates at capacity during peak periods, and since it <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time for passengers to board and alight trains, trains cannot leave and enter the station as might otherwise be possible. Even with improvements in the station, there are inadequate train storage facilities at Penn, and there is no capacity in the East River Tunnels to allow for trains to be stored during middays at Sunnyside Yard. Without these additional improvements, it is assumed that the same number of trains going between New Jersey and New York today would be operating in 2030, albeit with the additional tunnel capacity.|$|E

25|$|Casual {{matchmaking}} allows players, alone, or in a {{party with}} invited friends, to be randomly matched against others. The game servers will attempt to match the gathered players in party via a dynamic queue with others based on general skill level, only broadening outside this search range if it <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to find matching players. Blizzard works to adjust this matchmaking approach to making sure players will find matches of people with roughly equivalent skill level. For example, in June 2016, Blizzard removed the option for players to avoid specific opponents; the option was meant for players to be able ignore trolls, but instead found that highly skilled players were being put on these avoidance lists and were having difficulty finding games or would be matched with new and less-skilled players.|$|E
25|$|However, this {{identification}} is inexact: a polynomial-time solution with large exponent or large constant term grows quickly, {{and may be}} impractical for practical size problems; conversely, an exponential-time solution that grows slowly may be practical on realistic input, or a solution that <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time in the worst case may take a short time in most cases or the average case, and thus still be practical. Saying that a problem is not in P {{does not imply that}} all large cases of the problem are hard or even that most of them are. For example, the decision problem in Presburger arithmetic has been shown not to be in P, yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases. Similarly, algorithms can solve the NP-complete knapsack problem over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and SAT solvers routinely handle large instances of the NP-complete Boolean satisfiability problem.|$|E

25|$|Fluoxetine is a {{racemic mixture}} of (R)- and (S)-fluoxetine where both enantiomers {{contribute}} to its biological activity. Since mono-substitution in the 4-para {{position of the}} phenoxy group (figure 4) results in selective inhibition of 5-HT re-uptake, a disubstitution i.e. 2,3- or 2,4- substitution therefore results {{in a loss of}} SERT selectivity. Fluoxetine has the widest spectrum of activity since it is the least SERT selective of all the SSRIs. Fluoxetine also has a 5-HT2C antagonist activity where it blocks the 5-HT activity of 5-HT2C receptors enhancing the release of both NE and DA. A 5-HT2C antagonist do not only help out with therapeutic effects of fluoxetine but also the tolerability of the drug. The advantage of being 5-HT2C antagonist is that it has a stimulatory effect and many patients have experienced an increase in energy, concentration and focus and a decrease in fatigue from the very first dose. The stimulant activity of 5-HT2C antagonist can however, be a disadvantage for patients with agitation, insomnia and anxiety. Another feature of fluoxetine is a weak NE re-uptake inhibition which can have clinical effect in higher doses. Fluoxetine also has a long half-life which can reduce withdrawal symptoms which are characteristic for some SSRIs after abrupt discontinuation, but it also means that it <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to clear the drug and its active metabolite after discontinuing fluoxetine treatment.|$|E

A building capable of withstanding the roughest weather for hundreds of years. The older they get, the better they look.

Normal stone for buildings has to be specially cut into blocks; it <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to make and costs a fortune. But in north Wales the historic slate industry has left behind whole mountains of waste stone that no-one wants. This was stone cut from the mountainside for nearly two hundred years but which wasn't good enough to make roof slates. Over 90% was thrown away. But it was ideal for making walls like the one I had in mind... —architect Jonathan Adams ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2013 {{survey of}} Vaughan Williams's stage works, Eric Saylor writes, [...] "With the {{possible}} exception of Tchaikovsky, no composer's operatic career was less emblematic of his success elsewhere." [...] Although Vaughan Williams was a regular opera-goer, enthusiastic and knowledgeable about works by operatic masters from Mozart to Wagner and Verdi, his success in the operatic field was at best patchy. There is widespread agreement among commentators that this was partly due to the composer's poor choice of librettists for some, though not all, of his operas. Another problem was his keenness to encourage amateurs and student groups, which sometimes led to the staging of his operas with less than professional standards. A further factor was the composer's expressed preference for [...] "slow, long tableaux", which tended to reduce dramatic impact, although he believed them essential, as [...] "music <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to speak—much longer than words by themselves." ...|$|E
