The chef in charge is busy making love with Edna, so his apprentice has to slice the fish, of which certain parts are toxic. He tries to do it carefully, but Homer becomes impatient, only to have it served and become unsure if the poisonous portions have been removed. Homer considers it a treat, but the chef soon returns and believes that the fish has not been prepared correctly and tells Homer that he may have been poisoned. Homer and Marge go to the hospital, where Dr. Hibbert informs Homer that based on a chat he had with the sushi chef, Homer is found out that he has increased likeliness of death and has 22 hours left to live.

40|$|Background: We aim {{to explore}} factors {{influencing}} <b>the</b> breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> process in different medical contexts with irreversible conditions (others than cancer). Methods: 23 patients and 18 physicians concerned by different chronic diseases were interviewed by psychologists. They received/broke <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> in <b>the</b> few months preceding the interview. Findings: Thematic analysis of interviews allowed to identify higher-order themes, and more specific themes for both, patients and physicians. The main topics covered by physicians concerned {{the determinants of}} the strategies to communicate with patients, the encountered difficulties, the initial training, the information, interpersonal relationships, emotional reactions, perception of its role, {{the specifics of the}} disease. The discourse of patients referred to three stages including specifics topics: <b>the</b> communication of <b>bad</b> <b>news,</b> <b>the</b> health care pathways, and the life with disease. Discussion: Data analysis highlight importance of patient and physician’s profiles, and specifics of disease, in <b>the</b> breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> process. Recommendations to build tailored intervention for physicians by using formative self-assessment will be exposed...|$|R
40|$|Background: While both {{patients}} and physicians identify communication of <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> {{as an area}} of great challenge, the factors underlying this often complex task remain largely unknown. Emotional intelligence (EI) has been positively correlated with good general communication skills and successful leadership, {{but there is no}} literature relating EI to <b>the</b> delivery of <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> Purpose: Our objectives were to determine: 1) performance of first-year pediatric residents in <b>the</b> delivery of <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> in a standardized patient (SP) setting; and 2) the role of EI in these assessments. Our hypothesis was that pediatric trainees with higher EI would demonstrate more advanced skills in this communication task. Methods: Forty first- year residents participated. Skill in <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> delivery was assessed via SP encounters using a previously published assessment tool (GRIEV_ING Death Notification Protocol). Residents com-pleted the Emotional and Social Competency Inventory (ESCI) as a measure of EI. Results: Residents scored poorly on <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> delivery skills but scored well on EI. Intraclass correlation coefficients indicated moderate to substantial inter-rater reliability among raters using <b>the</b> delivering <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> assessment tool. However, no correlation was found between <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> delivery performance and EI. Conclusions: We concluded that first-year pediatric residents have inadequate skills in <b>the</b> delivery of <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> In addition, our data suggest that higher EI alone is not sufficient to effectively deliver death news and mor...|$|R

40|$|Simulation {{experiences}} {{have begun to}} replace traditional education models of teaching <b>the</b> skill of <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> delivery in medical education. The tiered apprenticeship model of medical education emphasizes experiential learning. Studies have described a lack of support in <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> delivery and inadequacy of training in this important clinical skill as well as poor familial comprehension and dissatisfaction {{on the part of}} physicians in training regarding the resident delivery of <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> Many residency training programs lacked a formalized training curriculum in <b>the</b> delivery of <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> Simulation teaching experiences may address these noted clinical deficits in <b>the</b> delivery of <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> to patients and their families. Unique experiences can be role-played with this educational technique to simulate perceived learner deficits. A variety of scenarios can be constructed {{within the framework of the}} simulation training method to address specific cultural and religious responses to <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> in <b>the</b> medical setting. Even potentially explosive and violent scenarios can be role-played in order to prepare physicians for these rare and difficult situations. While simulation experiences cannot supplant the model of positive, real-life clinical teaching in <b>the</b> delivery of <b>bad</b> <b>news,</b> simulation of clinical scenarios with scripting, self-reflection, and peer-to-peer feedback can be powerful educational tools. Simulation training can help to develop the skills needed to effectively and empathetically deliver <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> to patients and families in medical practice...|$|R

25|$|During the attack, an Iraqi {{doctor who}} was {{next door to}} the police station was alerted to the fact of the six RMPs being under siege and drove to the edge of town in an {{ambulance}} where a Major from 1 Para had established an Incident Control Point (ICP).
