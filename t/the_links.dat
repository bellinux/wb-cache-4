5|$|The FIPS {{county code}} is the five-digit Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code which uniquely {{identifies}} counties and county equivalents in the United States. The three-digit number {{is unique to}} each individual county within a state, but to be unique within the entire United States, it must be prefixed by the state code. This means that, for example, while Addison County, Vermont is 001, Belknap County, New Hampshire and Alachua County, Florida are also 001. To uniquely identify Addison County, Vermont, one must use the state code of 50 plus the county code of 001; therefore, the unique nationwide identifier for Addison County, Vermont is 50001. <b>The</b> <b>links</b> in the column FIPS County Code are to the Census Bureau Info page for that county.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{important}} {{class of}} models for macroscopic dynamic network loading (DNL) and dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) {{is based on}} treating link travel times {{as a function of}} link occupancy. However, these models suffer from some problems or deficiencies namely (a) <b>the</b> <b>link</b> outflows can violate first-in-first-out (FIFO), (b) <b>the</b> <b>link</b> outflows can exceed <b>the</b> <b>link</b> outflow capacities, (c) <b>the</b> <b>link</b> inflows can exceed <b>the</b> <b>link</b> inflow capacities, and (d) <b>the</b> <b>link</b> occupancies can exceed <b>the</b> <b>link</b> occupancy capacities. In this paper we introduce methods to overcome each of these problems. To remove problems (a) and (b) we extend <b>the</b> <b>link</b> travel-time model to better reflect behaviour when traffic flow is varying over time. To remove problems (c) and (d) we introduce more substantial changes in the model, to introduce capacities, spillback and queues compatible with the model. These extensions strengthen the realism, behavioural basis and usability of <b>the</b> <b>link</b> travel-time model and the DNL and DTA models that are based on it. They have no obvious adverse implications or side effects and require little additional computational effort. The original model is a special case of the new/extended model: the above extensions are activated if and only if any of the problems (a) –(d) arise, otherwise the new model reduces to the original model...|$|R
