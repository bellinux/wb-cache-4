5|$|The {{existing}} {{court and}} the anti-relief party refused to recognize the new court as valid. Achilles Sneed, clerk of the Old Court, refused a legislative mandate <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> his records to the New Court by January 1825. Francis Blair, the New Court clerk, assembled a group that broke into Sneed's office and took what records they could find. Sneed was charged with contempt of court and fined for refusing <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> the records. The Old Court continued to meet in a church in Frankfort; with two supreme courts, the possibility of civil war in Kentucky loomed.|$|E
5|$|Calvin Chadwick (portrayed by Currie Graham) is Frost's husband, {{the owner}} of Isodyne Energy and secret member of the Council of Nine. He is a senatorial {{candidate}} for the Council, until he tries <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> the powered-Frost to the Council out of fear; Frost absorbs him in retaliation.|$|E
5|$|The {{first appeal}} opened in September 2007 in the Court of Appeal of Paris, before {{a three-judge panel}} led by Judge Laurence Trébucq. The court asked France2 <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> the 27minutes of raw footage the {{cameraman}} said he had shot, to be shown during a public hearing. France2 produced 18minutes; Enderlin said that only 18 minutes had been shot.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{describe}} {{a number of}} Caligula's other desperate measures. In order to gain funds, Caligula asked the public to lend the state money. He levied taxes on lawsuits, weddings and prostitution. Caligula began auctioning {{the lives of the}} gladiators at shows. Wills that left items to Tiberius were reinterpreted to leave the items instead to Caligula. Centurions who had acquired property by plunder were forced <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> spoils to the state.|$|E
5|$|Sharp's {{role in the}} Relief Party's plan {{to abolish}} the old court {{and replace it with}} a new, more {{favorable}} court is not known. As he was the administration's chief legal counsel, historians believe he was closely involved. He is known to have issued the order for Old Court clerk Achilles Sneed <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> his records to New Court clerk Francis P. Blair. By practicing as state attorney general before the New Court to the exclusion of the Old Court, Sharp provided it a measure of legitimacy.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} of San Juan were furious with Capt. Rivero-Méndez and blamed {{him for the}} destruction wreaked on their city by American bombardments. Nothing came of those recriminations and Capt. Rivero-Méndez was ordered <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> the keys of all the military installations in San Juan to Captain Henry A. Reed of the U.S. Army after the Treaty of Paris of 1898 was signed.|$|E

5|$|Alan {{receives}} {{a call from}} a man purporting to be Alice's kidnapper, demanding the pages of Departure in exchange for her. Meeting at a state park, Alan is about <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> the pages when the man is consumed by a dark tornado and Alan is knocked out. He awakes in Barry and Dr. Hartman's care in the lodge overlooking Cauldron Lake. Dr. Hartman listens to Alan's story, and believes he is suffering a psychotic break; everything that he's witnessed being part of his imagination. Alan attempts to escape the lodge as the shadowy force starts to attack it; while running, Alan finds evidence that Dr. Hartman is aware of the supernatural events surrounding the lake. Barry helps Alan to escape the lodge before the shadow subsumes it and all those inside. Returning to town, they find the FBI have arrived, and attempt to arrest him, before the shadowy forces intervene, allowing Alan and Barry to escape.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} rest of the Hudson Line, the Scarborough station became a Penn Central station once the New York Central and Pennsylvania Railroads merged in 1968. Penn Central's {{continuous}} financial despair throughout the 1970s forced them <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> their commuter service to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The station and the railroad were turned over to Conrail in 1976, and eventually became part of the MTA's Metro-North Railroad in 1983. In 2007, the MTA overhauled the station, installing new systems such as platforms, canopies, shelters, enclosed staircases, lighting, and benches. The station's overpass was demolished and a replacement was built with elevators on either side. The new overpass was designed in a less modern style and now has glass-sided elevators. During the construction, Metro-North built a temporary wooden station to the station's south.|$|E
5|$|Bears are {{generally}} bulky and robust animals with short tails. They are sexually dimorphic {{with regard to}} size, with males typically being larger. Larger species tend to show increased levels of sexual dimorphism in comparison to smaller species. Relying as they do on strength rather than speed, bears have relatively short limbs with thick bones to support their bulk. The shoulder blades and the pelvis are correspondingly massive. The limbs are much straighter {{than those of the}} big cats as {{there is no need for}} them to flex in the same way due to the differences in their gait. The strong forelimbs are used to catch prey, to excavate dens, to dig out burrowing animals, <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> rocks and logs to locate prey, and to club large creatures.|$|E

50|$|Opponents {{from the}} {{political}} left generally accuse Hirsch of elitism. Worse yet in their minds, Hirsch's assertion {{might lead to a}} rejection of toleration, pluralism, and relativism. On the political right, Hirsch has been assailed as totalitarian, for his idea lends itself <b>to</b> <b>turning</b> <b>over</b> curriculum selection <b>to</b> federal authorities and thereby eliminating the time-honored American tradition of locally controlled schools.|$|R
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1861, Johnson tried mightily to assert the {{legitimacy}} of the fledgling government, but to no avail. Its jurisdiction extended only as far as the area controlled by the Confederate Army. Johnson came woefully short of raising the 46,000 troops requested by the Confederate Congress in Richmond. Efforts to levy taxes and to compel citizens <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> their guns to the government were similarly unsuccessful. On January 3, 1862, Johnson requested a sum of $3million from the Confederate Congress to meet the provisional government's operating expenses. The Congress instead approved a sum of $2million, the expenditure of which required approval of Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin and President Davis.|$|E
5|$|Earp {{was named}} deputy sheriff {{in the area}} {{including}} newly incorporated Kootenai County, Idaho, which was disputing jurisdiction of Eagle City with Shoshone County. There were {{a considerable number of}} disagreements over mining claims and property rights, which Earp had a part in. On March 28, several feet of snow were still on the ground. Bill Buzzard, a miner of dubious reputation, began constructing a building when one of Wyatt's partners, Jack Enright, tried to stop the construction. Enright claimed the building was on part of his property. Words were exchanged and Buzzard reached for his Winchester. He fired several shots at Enright and a skirmish developed. Allies of both sides quickly took defensive positions between snowbanks and began shooting at one another. Deputy Sheriff Wyatt Earp and his brother James stepped {{into the middle of the}} fray and helped peacefully resolve the dispute before anyone was seriously hurt. Shoshone County Deputy W. E. Hunt then arrived and ordered the parties <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> their weapons.|$|E
5|$|Europe {{had been}} by then embroiled in the French Revolutionary Wars since 1792. After {{five years of}} war, the French Republic subdued the First Coalition in 1797. A Second Coalition was formed in 1798 but this too was {{defeated}} by 1801. Britain remained the only opponent for the new French Consulate. In March 1802, France and Britain agreed to end hostilities under the Treaty of Amiens. For {{the first time in}} ten years, all of Europe was at peace. There were many problems between the two sides and implementing the agreements they had reached at Amiens seemed to be a growing challenge. Britain resented having <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> all colonial conquests since 1793 and France was angry that British troops had not evacuated the island of Malta. The tense situation only worsened when Napoleon sent an expeditionary force to crush the Haitian Revolution. In May 1803, Britain declared war on France.|$|E

5|$|Europe {{had been}} embroiled in warfare, pitting revolutionary France against {{a series of}} coalitions, nearly {{continuously}} since 1792. After five years of war, the French Republic subdued the First Coalition in 1797. A Second Coalition was formed in 1798, only to be defeated. In March 1802, France (now under Napoleon, as First Consul) and Great Britain, its one remaining enemy, agreed to end hostilities under the Treaty of Amiens. For {{the first time in}} ten years, all of Europe was at peace. However, many disagreements between the two sides remained unresolved, and implementing the agreements they had reached at Amiens seemed to be a growing challenge. Britain resented having <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> all of its colonial conquests since 1793 when France was permitted to retain most of its conquered territory in Europe. France, meanwhile, was upset that British troops had not evacuated the island of Malta. In May 1803, Britain declared war on France.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{surrender}} of the Royal Yugoslav Army on 17 April 1941, while stationed at an airfield at Zemun near Belgrade, the Geschwader received orders on 3 May 1941 <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> all Bf109-Es so they could receive the new Bf 109-F variant. Transition training was completed at Airfield Stolp-Reitz in Pomerania. Following intensive training, the Geschwader was moved to airfields in Eastern Prussia. On 22 June at 03:05, 120 aircraft of the Geschwader crossed into Soviet airspace in support of Operation Barbarossa, {{the invasion of the}} Soviet Union. Philipp, like many other German fighter pilots, enjoyed superiority over his Soviet adversaries in the early phase of Barbarossa, both in terms of the training he had received and the aircraft that he flew. He quickly accumulated further victories and on account of his 31st to 33rd victories achieved on 4 July was mentioned in the Wehrmachtbericht radio report, the first of five such mentions, on 7 July.|$|E
5|$|Hearing noise, Mulder heads {{outside and}} {{witnesses}} a UFO flying overhead; inside, small beings run past Scully. Cars full of armed soldiers arrive, forcing the agents to flee. The agents meet with Skinner at a diner in rural Maryland. Skinner wants <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> the tape {{in exchange for}} their reinstatement and safety. After initially objecting, Mulder agrees to let Skinner turn the tape over. Skinner heads to see Melissa in the hospital and is told by Albert of the mysterious blue-suited man outside. Skinner chases the man to a stairwell where he is attacked by Alex Krycek and Luis Cardinal, who beat him unconscious and steal the tape.|$|E

5|$|In 987, Maymun, emir of Derbent, {{asked the}} Rus' {{to help him}} against local chiefs. The Rus', many of whom {{appear to have been}} {{professional}} soldiers, arrived on 18 ships. Uncertain of their reception, they sent only one ship to reconnoitre the situation. When its crew were massacred by the local population, the Rus' went on to loot the city of Maskat. In 989, this same Maymun is reported to have refused the demand of a local preacher <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> his Rus' mercenaries to him for either conversion to Islam or death. In the ensuing struggle, Maymun was driven from the city and forced to surrender the Rus' soldiers, but he returned in 992.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Watergate, the Ford administration was engaged {{in a number of}} conflicts with Congress. Scalia repeatedly testified before congressional committees, defending Ford administration assertions of executive privilege regarding its refusal <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> documents. Within the administration, Scalia advocated a presidential veto for a bill to amend the Freedom of Information Act, which would greatly increase the act's scope. Scalia's view prevailed, and Ford vetoed the bill, but Congress overrode it. In early 1976, Scalia argued his only case before the Supreme Court, Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba. Scalia, on behalf of the US government, argued in support of Dunhill, and that position was successful.|$|E
5|$|Late {{that night}} the generals held a council of war in which Floyd and Pillow {{expressed}} satisfaction with {{the events of the}} day, but Buckner convinced them that they had little realistic chance to hold the fort or escape from Grant's army, which was receiving steady reinforcements. General Floyd, concerned he would be tried for treason if captured by the North, sought Buckner's assurance that he would be given time to escape with some of his Virginia regiments before the army surrendered. Buckner agreed and Floyd offered <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>over</b> command to his subordinate, Pillow. Pillow immediately declined and passed command to Buckner, who agreed to stay behind and surrender. Both Generals Floyd and Pillow left to leave General Buckner to surrender to the Union Forces. Pillow and Floyd were able to escape, as did cavalry commander Col. Nathan Bedford Forrest.|$|E
