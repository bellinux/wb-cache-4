In 2013, the further revision of the Planned Birth Policy allowed couples in which either parent had no siblings <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>two</b> children. In 2015, China allowed all couples <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>two</b> children, abolishing its decades-long one-child policy for urban families.|$|E

5|$|Nathan Lazur {{initially}} {{planned to}} create a Chrono Trigger remake for the Nintendo 64, called CT64, using GNU-based homebrew tools. Lazur's motivation for the project came in 1999 when playing Chrono Trigger and Super Mario 64.

5|$|Other {{designs of}} the mid-H series {{included}} the He 111 H-7 and H-8. The airframes {{were to be}} rebuilds of the H-3/H-5 variant.

The intention was for the H-8 to be fitted with cable-cutting equipment and barrage ballon deflectors {{on the leading edge}} of the wings. The H-7 was never built.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the reason}} for this is the {{extensive}} freeway system in the city, due to the majority of that system being funded by local, rather than federal funds, through a half-cent general sales tax measure approved by voters in 1985.

5000|$|Clausen saw {{the cause}} of being caught {{unprepared}} during the Pearl Harbor attack, as due both <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>two</b> separate commands at Pearl Harbor (Navy & Army), and <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>two</b> separate Intelligence organizations in Washington and elsewhere (Navy and Army), and so welcomed {{the combination of the}} Navy and Army efforts by Truman (eventually this came to be called NSA). MacArthur told him that he [...] "had to barter like a rug merchant throughout the war to get the intelligence I have needed from the Navy." [...] MacArthur also said that he got [...] "ample and complete information" [...] from the War Department prior to 7 December.|$|R

The box set charted in multiple nations including Croatia, Finland, France, Italy, Korea, Mexico, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom. It entered the top-ten of the Japanese Oricon album chart.

5|$|Boyd was {{appointed}} {{as head of}} the Mathematics and Science Department at West Georgia College in 1933. In 1935, he joined the faculty at the Georgia Institute of Technology as an assistant professor of physics. Boyd married Elizabeth Reynolds Cobb, daughter of Betty Reynolds Cobb and Hiram Felix Cobb, on June 2, 1934. James and Elizabeth went on <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>two</b> children: a daughter, Betty Cobb Boyd (born August 26, 1939) and a son, James Fortson Boyd (born October 9, 1942). With World War II under way, Boyd joined the United States Navy in 1942, serving as a lieutenant and later lieutenant commander in the Bureau of Ordnance, performing research on radar. From 1945 to 1946, he was a commander in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations where he worked on radar and electronics.|$|E
5|$|Comets {{are thought}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>two</b> {{separate}} points of {{origin in the}} Solar System. Short-period comets (those with orbits of up to 200years) are generally accepted to have emerged from either the Kuiper belt or the scattered disc, which are two linked flat discs of icy debris beyond Neptune's orbit at 30AU and jointly extending out beyond 100AU from the Sun. Long-period comets, such as comet Hale–Bopp, whose orbits last for thousands of years, are thought to originate in the Oort cloud. The orbits within the Kuiper belt are relatively stable, and so very few comets are thought to originate there. The scattered disc, however, is dynamically active, and is {{far more likely to}} be the place of origin for comets. Comets pass from the scattered disc into the realm of the outer planets, becoming what are known as centaurs. These centaurs are then sent farther inward to become the short-period comets.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of his studies, he moved to Lancashire to assist a project building the Royal Ordnance factory number 7 in Kirby, before returning to London to work in housing design for the Metropolitan Borough of Hammersmith. On 18 May 1941, he married Doris Isabel Parker (1920–2003), an old friend {{who worked as a}} clerk and who, like Hollamby, {{was a member of the}} Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). Their wedding took place at St Michael's Church at Tokyngton, Middlesex, after which they moved to St. Peter's Square, Hammersmith. They went on <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>two</b> daughters and a son. In August 1941, during Britain's involvement in World War II, Hollamby was called up to serve in the British armed forces. Assigned to the Royal Marine Engineers, he served most of the conflict in Trincomalee, Ceylon.|$|E

30|$|The {{proposed}} scheme {{is superior to}} the DSM system as it <b>has</b> <b>two</b> separate constellations.
