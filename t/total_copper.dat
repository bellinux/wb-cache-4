40|$|International audienceThis one-year survey {{conducted}} in the macrotidal estuary of Penzé (Brittany, Western part of the Channel, France) was aimed at examining the variations of the various dissolved and particulate copper species. Ten field stations along the whole freshwater–seawater mixing zone were sampled each month. Different biogeochemical parameters (SPM, chl-a, pH and DOC) were also measured. The levels in total dissolved and <b>total</b> particulate <b>copper</b> ranged from 1. 8 to 9. 5 nM and from 5 to 98 μg g− 1, respectively; such amounts are indicative of a pollution-free system. Extractable C 18 copper (non-polar hydrophobic organic copper species), in winter and spring, accounted for 30 – 40 % of the <b>total</b> dissolved <b>copper.</b> In summer, this contribution rapidly rose to 60 % in the salinity range 20 – 30; {{over the same period}} of time, <b>total</b> particulate <b>copper</b> decreased. The change in dissolved copper speciation and the lowering of particulate copper concentrations were attributed to the release of strong organic ligands by phytoplankton. Our field data evidenced a highly variable behaviour for the various copper species over the seasonal cycle, and then led us to identify the following mechanisms: (i) metal desorption from organic river-flown particles (winter and spring), (ii) metal desorption from resuspended sediment in the upstream section (summer), (iii) competition between particles, non-extractable C 18 organic ligands and phytoplankton-released extractable C 18 organic ligands to complex copper in the downstream section (summer), and (iv) removal of non-extractable C 18 organic copper by adsorption (autumn). Dissolved copper species fluxes were assessed: most of metal inputs to the estuary (60 – 74 %) corresponded to non-extractable C 18 organic copper. Winter and spring metal output fluxes were mainly constituted of non-extractable C 18 organic complexes; on the other hand, extractable C 18 organic complexes were predominant in summer and autumn output fluxes...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY <b>Total</b> serum <b>copper</b> and ultrafilterable copper {{levels in}} {{patients}} with rheumatoid arthritis were determined and related to articular index, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and serum iron concentration. Relationships were found between serum copper and ESR, and between ultra-filterable copper and articular index. The relationship between serum copper and serum iron {{was found to be}} a drug-dependent. The role of copper in rheumatoid arthritis has recently been of interest because of the abnormally high copper levels in the serum of patients with the disease (Bajpayee et al., 1975; Scudder et al., 1978), the greater anti-inflammatory activity of copper complexes of anti-inflammatory drugs (Sorensen, 1976), and a recent investigation of the persistent traditional use of copper bangles in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (Walker and Griffin, 1976). We report here our findings from a survey of over 100 patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving different forms of therapy. In all cases the <b>total</b> serum <b>copper</b> concentration was estimated, and in a limited number the ultrafilterable copper level (using a cut-off of 1000 Dalton molecular weight) was determined by a newly developed method (Kamel et al., 1978).

All were suffering from classical or definite rheumatoid arthritis as defined by the criteria of the American Rheumatism Association (Ropes et al., 1959).

5000|$|The Pinal Mountains have an {{abundance}} {{and variety of}} minerals, both precious and non-precious. Numerous mining claims existed in the Pinal Mountains from 1875 to the early 1900s. With precious minerals such as Copper, Silver, and trace amounts of Gold being mined in varying quantities from the mountains during that period. Other less precious minerals found in more abundance in the mountains include Iron, Quartz, Calcite, Malachite, Azurite, Feldspar, Diorite, and the Lead ores of Galena and Anglesite. The most successful mine was the Gibson mine, located on the far western section of the range and was most successful from 1906-1918.

40|$|A {{supported}} {{liquid membrane}} (SLM) technique for {{the determination of}} free and labile copper in estuarine and coastal water was developed. The SLM consisted of 10 mM Lasalocid, a naturally occurring carboxylic polyether ionophore, dissolved in o-nitrophenyl octyl ether (NPOE), immobilized on a thin microporous solid membrane. The solid membrane was sandwiched between two aqueous phases: (1) a source or sample solution containing the analyte (in this case free/labile copper) to be extracted and (2) a strip or acceptor solution into which the analyte(s) is trapped. The membrane support was clamped between two circular Teflon blocks each with circular groves like an Archimedes spiral.
