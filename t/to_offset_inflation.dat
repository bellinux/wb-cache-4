5000|$|However, all of {{this growth}} was {{somewhat}} illusory and when interest rates rose <b>to</b> <b>offset</b> <b>inflation,</b> conglomerate profits fell. Investors noticed that the companies inside the conglomerate were growing no faster than before they were purchased, whereas the rationale for buying a company was that [...] "synergies" [...] would provide efficiency. By the late 1960s they were shunned by the market, and a major sell-off of their shares ensued. To keep the companies going, many conglomerates were forced to shed the industries they had recently purchased, and by the mid-1970s most {{had been reduced to}} shells. The conglomerate fad was subsequently replaced by newer ideas like focusing on a company's core competency.|$|E

After a number of small demonstrations in the mainly Shia areas of the east, public protests were banned in March 2011, and King Abdullah warned that threats to the nation's security and stability would not be tolerated.|$|R
40|$|Exchange rate {{rigidity}} {{is often}} cited {{as one of the}} primary causes of Asia's crisis. However, measured by real effective exchange rates (inflation-adjusted and tradeweighted exchange rates) using consumer prices or wholesale prices, no serious overvaluation is detected in the worst-hit economies during the pre-crisis period. Most of the Asian developing economies permitted their currencies to deviate from the strict dollar peg in the medium to long run in order <b>to</b> <b>offset</b> <b>inflation</b> gaps and movements of major currencies. Counterfactual simulations over the pre-crisis period show that, to stabilize competitiveness, proper adjustments for inflation by individual economies are more important than the choice of currency weights. Adoption of a common currency basket in the region does not add much stability. Pragmatic exchange rate policy rules distinguishing normal and crisis periods are suggested. To stabilize competitiveness during the normal period, no radical reform of the existing system is needed in developing Asia...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Instability in a Phillips curve {{relation}} originates from {{a theoretical}} {{model in which}} monopolistic firms face changing quadratic costs of price adjustment. Deriving the switching-Phillips curve explicitly from the firm’s optimization problem has benefits in terms of constructing a utility-based welfare criterion. Optimal monetary policy is computed under both ad-hoc and utility-based welfare criteria, where the utility-based criterion has a weight on the output gap that varies {{with the cost of}} price adjustment. The ad-hoc welfare criterion instructs monetary policy to change the systematic component of policy <b>to</b> <b>offset</b> <b>inflation</b> depending on the state determining the cost of price adjustment. In contrast, the utility-based welfare criterion instructs monetary policy to keep its systematic actions constant. The results imply that a central bank using an ad-hoc criterion will place too much weight on output stabilization in states with a ‘steep ’ Phillips curve and not enough in states with a relatively flat Phillips curve. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{specifies}} {{and estimates}} a structural {{model of a}} small open economy to the Dominican Republic. The objective is to provide an analytical framework based on a rigorous theoretical component, but also including aspects that capture satisfactorily the dynamics of macroeconomic variables and being empirically plausible for its use for forecasting and policy analysis. The structure adopted in the model specification is standard {{in the literature of}} small open economies and is {{based on the work of}} Galí and Monacelli (2005), Justiniano and Preston (2005), Ercerg, Henderson and Levin (2000) and Lubik and Schorfheide (2005). The model is characterized by relationships between macroeconomic aggregates that reflect the behavior of economic agents and the technical and institutional constraints they face. The economy is populated by four types of agents: households, producers and importers of differentiated final goods consumption, and a government run monetary policy to influence economic conditions. Households choose each period how much to consume and work, while firms choose price and quantity of goods to offer to meet the demand. The external sector of the economy is characterized by the export of a fraction of domestic production and imports of goods consumed domestically, where the proportions are determined by the relative prices of domestically produced goods relative to foreign. Households have access to two vehicles for mobilizing resources intertemporally, a domestic bond and one external. Finally, the government is characterize by the behavior of the Central Bank who adjust it policy rate <b>to</b> <b>offset</b> <b>inflation</b> and output deviations from their equilibrium levels. ...|$|E
40|$|Nominal {{exchange}} rates {{do not move}} <b>to</b> <b>offset</b> differences in <b>inflation</b> rates on a month to month, quarter to quarter, or even year to year basis, resulting in sizable real exchange rate changes. Are these changes predictable? We address this question in three ways. First, we describe a variety of tests of predictability and explain how the different tests are related. Next, we implement the tests for the U. S. dollar relative to four currencies and find statistically significant evidence that real exchange rate changes are predictable. Finally, we examine whether the predictability is of an economically interesting magnitude. ...|$|R
40|$|Why has {{inflation}} been so {{stable in}} developed economies {{since the early}} 1990 s ? In this paper, we answer that the United States and other countries may have escaped from a volatile inflation equilibrium. Our argument builds on the story proposed by Tom Sargent in The Conquest of American Inflation, where the fall in inflation in the 1980 s was attributed to changing government beliefs. To explain the escape in inflation volatility, we unwind one of Sargent's simplifications and allow the government to react {{to some of the}} shocks in the economy. In this case, when government beliefs turned against the Phillips curve in the 1980 s they not only led to an escape from high inflation, but also stopped government using changes in <b>inflation</b> <b>to</b> <b>offset</b> shocks. <b>Inflation</b> and inflation volatility therefore escaped in tandem. Our analysis also sheds some light on why the escape in inflation occurred at the time it did. ...|$|R
40|$|The Consumer Price Index (CPI) {{is widely}} used to adjust wages and federal {{benefits}} as an <b>offset</b> <b>to</b> <b>inflation,</b> but the index contains substantial sources of bias as used for such purposes. For instance, these sources of bias, such as changes in the real cost of petroleum, the cost of environmental protection, and an inappropriate method for measuring homeownership costs, accounted for {{nearly half of the}} CPI increase in the year from November 1978 to November 1979. Because {{of the nature of the}} index, such biases will always be present, creating the risk that the CPI may be adding to the inflation that it is only supposed to measure. Therefore, a new index or indexes that are more appropriate for adjusting wages and benefits for inflation should be developed. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} empirical {{determinants of}} the Pakistani rupee exchange rate {{since the advent}} of the managed float in 1982. The behaviour of the nominal exchange rate results from policy intervention carried out by the monetary authorities. Various testable hypotheses are developed in order to discern the factor(s) which can be the determinants of the nominal rupee exchange rate. In the short run, authorities follow a contingent policy rule with respect to movements of the U. S. dollar against the SDR. Based on vector autoregression techniques, the error correction model is employed to check the consistency of the short-run adjustment process, given the authorities' long-run target rupee value. The 'revealed' policy is <b>to</b> partly <b>offset</b> the <b>inflation</b> differential between Pakistan and its major trading partners. Under plausible conditions, the burden of adjustment and recessionary conditions are likely to occur in the Pakistani export sector. ...|$|R
40|$|Why is {{inflation}} so {{much lower}} {{and at the}} same time more stable in developed economies in the 1990 s, compared with the 1970 s? This paper suggests that the United Kingdom, United States and other countries may have escaped from a volatile inflation equilibrium. Our argument builds on the story proposed by Tom Sargent in The conquest of American inflation, where the fall in inflation in the 1980 s was attributed to the changing beliefs informing monetary policy. To explain the escape in inflation volatility, we unwind one of Sargent’s simplifications and allow the monetary authority to react to some of the shocks in the economy. In this new model, a revised account of recent history is that when the evidence turned against the existence of a long-run inflation-output trade-off in the 1980 s there was an escape from high inflation, but the authorities were also persuaded to stop using changes in <b>inflation</b> <b>to</b> <b>offset</b> shocks. <b>Inflation</b> and inflation volatility therefore escaped in tandem. Our analysis also sheds some light on why the escape in inflation occurred at the time it did. Our model, like the Sargent model it derives from, omits the revolution in institutional design and understanding that underpins monetary policy. So the gloomy predictions for the future derived from a literal reading of it are likely to be unfounded. ...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{critics of}} trade liberalization, such as Noam Chomsky, Tariq Ali, Susan George, and Naomi Klein, see the Washington Consensus {{as a way}} to open the labor market of {{underdeveloped}} economies to exploitation by companies from more developed economies. The prescribed reductions in tariffs and other trade barriers allow the free movement of goods across borders according to market forces, but labor is not permitted to move freely due to the requirements of a visa or a work permit. This creates an economic climate where goods are manufactured using cheap labor in underdeveloped economies and then exported to rich First World economies for sale at what the critics argue are huge markups, with the balance of the markup said to accrue to large multinational corporations. The criticism is that workers in the Third World economy nevertheless remain poor, as any pay raises they may have received over what they made before trade liberalization are said <b>to</b> be <b>offset</b> by <b>inflation,</b> whereas workers in the First World country become unemployed, while the wealthy owners of the multinational grow even more wealthy.|$|R

In many cases, however, the low proportion of subjects who switch from the pre-set default option might partly explained by inexperience with the goods or services offered, and high transaction costs for switching.

Either the participants had <b>to</b> opt-in <b>to</b> <b>offset,</b> opt-out <b>to</b> <b>offset</b> or there was no default option, i. e. an active choice had to be made with no implicit “guidance” from the default.
