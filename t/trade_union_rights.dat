25|$|The {{principal}} ideological disagreement Socialist Studies {{has with}} the Socialist Party of Great Britain is its attitude towards attempts by workers living under political dictatorships to establish elementary democratic and <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>rights,</b> especially in Eastern Europe in the 1980s and early 1990s.|$|E

Among the first of the LRA’s aspirations, listed in the Preamble, is [...] "to regulate the organisational rights of trade unions."

25|$|After a {{by-election}} {{defeat in}} 1942, {{a group of}} younger Conservatives from the Conservative Party of Canada met in Port Hope, Ontario, {{to develop a new}} Conservative policy they hoped would bring them out of the political wilderness. The participants, known as the Port Hopefuls, developed a program including many Conservative goals such as support for free enterprise and conscription. Yet the charter also included more radical policies, such as full-employment, low-cost housing, <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>rights,</b> as well as a whole range of social security measures, including a government financed medicare system.|$|E
25|$|White was an {{advocate}} for jobs, labour and human rights before several international forums including the G8 and the OECD (the organization of the 25 most industrial nations).

25|$|The {{right to}} strike {{is one of the}} {{essential}} means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their economic and social interests. The Committee considers that this basic right is not really guaranteed when a worker who exercises it legally runs the risk of seeing his or her job taken up permanently by another worker, just as legally. The Committee considers that, if a strike is otherwise legal, the use of labour drawn from outside the undertaking to replace strikers for an indeterminate period entails a risk of derogation from the {{right to strike}} which may affect the free exercise of <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cathy Massiter is a British {{whistleblower}} {{and former}} member of MI5 who revealed that the British security service carried out surveillance of British <b>trade</b> <b>unions,</b> civil <b>rights</b> organisations and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.

30|$|Still, {{keeping in}} mind today’s realities of Russian {{participation}} in “car” GVCs, employment policy and labour legislation seem to be important (<b>trade</b> <b>unions,</b> workers’ <b>rights),</b> which could artificially increase the rent created in the assembly segment, though this would {{have a negative effect}} on the prices.|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} process also faces huge problems and negative criticisms relating to gender. In the garment industry, approximately 80% {{of the workers}} are female. The main reason that majority of garment production is located in Asia {{is because of the}} low labor cost. The female was usually treated poorly in factories. They are sexually harassed by managers or other male workers, low paid wages, violating <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> <b>rights</b> and discrimination against pregnant women. Whether female are pregnant, single, young or old, they are poorly treated in different ways. Plenty of the workers will remain quiet in order to keep their contract and continue working in the factory.|$|R
25|$|This {{meant that}} a group of car valeters, {{although}} described in their contracts as being self-employed, with a right to substitute another person to do their work, and professed to have no obligation to undertake work, were entitled to a minimum wage and paid leave. The contract terms could be disregarded because they did not represent the reality of the situation. In addition, a ‘worker’ is defined in ERA 1996 section 230 as someone with a contract of employment or who personally performs work and is not a client or a customer. This concept has greater scope, and protects more people, than does the term ‘employee’. This class of person is entitled to a safe system of work, a minimum wage and limits on working time, as well as discrimination and <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>rights,</b> but not job security, child care and retirement rights. This concept thus reaches up to protect people who are quasi-self-employed professionals, such as partners of a law firm. People will also be workers but not employees when they are not so vulnerable, and relatively independent from their employers, such as home cleaners, music teachers who visit a student home, or independent taxi cab drivers. However, if they are employed through an agency, they will be employees in relation to the agency. Though not entitled to employee rights, these workers may form trade unions and take collective action under UK, EU and international law, to protect their interests.|$|E
500|$|The International Transport Workers' Federation goes further, {{stating that}} flags of {{convenience}} [...] "provide {{a means of}} avoiding labor regulation {{in the country of}} ownership, and become a vehicle for paying low wages and forcing long hours of work and unsafe working conditions. Since FOC ships have no real nationality, they are beyond the reach of any single national seafarers' trade union." [...] They also say that these ships have low safety standards and no construction requirements, that they [...] "do not enforce safety standards, minimum social standards or <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>rights</b> for seafarers", that they frequently fail to pay their crews, have poor safety records, and engage in practices such as abandoning crewmen in distant ports.|$|E
500|$|The {{legislation}} was enacted in June 1933 during the Great Depression in the United States {{as part of}} President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal legislative program. Section 7(a) of the bill, which protected collective bargaining rights for unions, proved contentious (especially in the Senate), but both chambers eventually passed the legislation. President Roosevelt signed the bill into law on June 16, 1933. The Act had two main sections (or [...] "titles"). Title I was devoted to industrial recovery, authorizing the promulgation of industrial codes of fair competition, guaranteed <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>rights,</b> permitted the regulation of working standards, and regulated the price of certain refined petroleum products and their transportation. Title II established the Public Works Administration, outlined the projects and funding opportunities it could engage in. Title II also provided funding for the Act.|$|E

50|$|The Thero came to {{prominence}} during his struggle against then-President J. R. Jayewardene (in office: 1977-1988) and the latter's efforts to centralize {{power within the}} presidency, and threats against freedom of expression, civil rights {{and the rule of}} law. Thero {{was one of the most}} important leaders of the anti-Indian intervention campaign in the late 1980s as well. He was an excellent orator in mobilizing the Sri Lankan populace across the spectrum. He put his charisma, influence and skill to maximum use in the fight through the National Movement for a Just Society (NMJS) to usher in a democratic government on 8 January 2015 by uniting a divided opposition and the <b>trade</b> <b>unions,</b> <b>rights</b> groups, artists, professionals and academia.|$|R

2500|$|Reed was {{considered}} a moderate and often provided the critical fifth vote in split rulings. He authored more than 300 opinions, and Chief Justice Warren Burger said [...] "he wrote with clarity and firmness...." [...] Reed was an economic progressive, and generally supported racial desegregation, civil liberties, <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>rights</b> and economic regulation. On free speech, national security and certain social issues, however, Reed was generally a conservative. He often approved of federal (but not state or local) restrictions on civil liberties. Reed also opposed applying the Bill of Rights to the states via the 14th Amendment.|$|E
5000|$|George Alfred Brown, Baron George-Brown, PC (2 September 1914 - 2 June 1985) was a British Labour {{politician}} {{who served as}} Deputy Leader of the Labour Party from 1960 to 1970 and also in several Cabinet posts, including Foreign Secretary during the Labour government of the 1960s. He was {{a leader of the}} Labour Party's <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>right</b> wing, and an effective election campaigner. Ultimately, however, he was unable to cope with the pressures of high office without excessive drinking. He was always known simply as [...] "George Brown" [...] and, upon being granted a peerage in November 1970, he insisted on combining his first name and surname to create the title Baron George-Brown of Jevington in the County of Sussex.|$|R
50|$|Sir William Brett's {{decision}} has been {{called one of the}} most important in the Victorian period. The strike of 1872 forced many union organizers to think more widely: they set up a Federated body to represent workers across London. But it would not be until the Gas workers strike of 1889 that they would earn the 8 hour day. The Gas stokers had a particularly harsh existence. The work was dirty and dangerous. The casualty rate was high amongst workers with many fatal accidents leading to children without fathers. The judge's handling in the case was questioned. His opinion flanked the Criminal Law Amendment Act, and revived the whole examination of <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>right</b> to strike; this raised the safety issues in relation to the general public; and the inequality of the Master-servant relationship inherent in the act by the same name. The <b>Trades</b> <b>Unions</b> Congress of January 1873 meeting at Leeds vowed to repeal the act.|$|R
5000|$|Wilson's {{government}} in 1969 proposed {{a series of}} reforms to the legal basis for industrial relations (labour law) in the UK, which were outlined in a White Paper entitled [...] "In Place of Strife", which proposed to give <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> statutory <b>rights,</b> but also to limit their power. The White Paper was championed by Wilson and Barbara Castle. The proposals however faced stiff opposition from the <b>Trades</b> <b>Union</b> Congress, and some key cabinet ministers such as James Callaghan.|$|R

5000|$|Minimum wages, {{employment}} protection and <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> recognition <b>rights</b> {{for the benefit}} of workers. The objectives of these policies are to guarantee living wages and help produce full employment. There are a number of different models of <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> protection which evolved, but they all guarantee the right of workers to form unions, negotiate benefits and participate in strikes. Germany, for instance, appointed union representatives at high levels in all corporations and had much less industrial strife than the UK, whose laws encouraged strikes rather than negotiation.|$|R
