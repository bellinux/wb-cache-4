25|$|Psychological abuse, also {{referred}} to as emotional abuse or mental abuse, is a form of abuse characterized by a person subjecting or exposing another <b>to</b> <b>behavior</b> that is psychologically harmful. Such abuse is often associated with situations of power imbalance, such as abusive relationships, bullying, child abuse and in the workplace.|$|E
25|$|Psychoanalysis, a psychotherapeutic {{approach}} <b>to</b> <b>behavior</b> change {{developed by}} Sigmund Freud and modified by his followers, has also offered {{an explanation of}} substance abuse. This orientation suggests {{the main cause of}} the addiction syndrome is the unconscious need to entertain and to enact various kinds of homosexual and perverse fantasies, {{and at the same time}} to avoid taking responsibility for this. It is hypothesised specific drugs facilitate specific fantasies and using drugs is considered to be a displacement from, and a concomitant of, the compulsion to masturbate while entertaining homosexual and perverse fantasies. The addiction syndrome is also hypothesised to be associated with life trajectories that have occurred within the context of traumatogenic processes, the phases of which include social, cultural and political factors, encapsulation, traumatophilia, and masturbation as a form of self-soothing. Such an approach lies in stark contrast to the approaches of social cognitive theory to addiction—and indeed, <b>to</b> <b>behavior</b> in general—which holds human beings regulate and control their own environmental and cognitive environments, and are not merely driven by internal, driving impulses. Additionally, homosexual content is not implicated as a necessary feature in addiction.|$|E
25|$|Government can {{be defined}} as the {{political}} means of creating and enforcing laws; typically via a bureaucratic hierarchy. Politics is the process by which decisions are made within groups; this process often involves conflict as well as compromise. Although the term is generally applied <b>to</b> <b>behavior</b> within governments, politics is also observed in all human group interactions, including corporate, academic, and religious institutions. Many different political systems exist, as do many different ways of understanding them, and many definitions overlap. Examples of governments include monarchy, Communist state, military dictatorship, theocracy, and liberal democracy, the last of which is considered dominant today. All of these issues have a direct relationship with economics.|$|E

25|$|In January 2017, a {{scientist}} at the Naval Research Laboratory published a report of ten sightings of ivory-billed woodpeckers, including nine in the Pearl River along the Louisiana-Mississippi border {{and one in the}} Choctawhatchee River. Three of the sightings are supported by video footage of birds with flights, behaviors, field marks, and other characteristics that {{do not seem to be}} consistent with any species of the region other than the ivory-billed woodpecker. Nobody has managed to obtain indisputable photographic evidence for the persistence of the ivory-billed woodpecker, but the paper contains an analysis based on factors related <b>to</b> <b>behavior</b> and habitat suggesting that such evidence is unlikely to be obtained in time to make a difference in the conservation of this species.|$|E
25|$|Merzenich and DT Blake (2002, 2005, 2006) {{went on to}} use {{cortical}} implants {{to study}} the evolution of plasticity in both the somatosensory and auditory systems. Both systems show similar changes with respect <b>to</b> <b>behavior.</b> When a stimulus is cognitively associated with reinforcement, its cortical representation is strengthened and enlarged. In some cases, cortical representations can increase two to threefold in 1–2 days when a new sensory motor behavior is first acquired, and changes are largely finalised within at most a few weeks. Control studies show that these changes are not caused by sensory experience alone: they require learning about the sensory experience, they are strongest for the stimuli {{that are associated with}} reward, and they occur with equal ease in operant and classical conditioning behaviors.|$|E
25|$|Other {{researchers}} have investigated {{to what extent}} these behavioral economic lab experiments on social preferences can be generalized <b>to</b> <b>behavior</b> in the field. In a 2011 study, Fehr and Leibbrandt {{examined the relationship between}} contributions in public goods games to participation in public goods in the community of shrimpers in Brazil. These shrimpers cut a hole in the bottom of their fishing bucket in order to allow immature shrimp to escape, thereby investing in the public good of the shared shrimp population. The size of the hole {{can be seen as the}} degree to which participants cooperate, as larger holes allow more shrimp to escape. Controlling for a number of other possible influences, Fehr and Leibbrandt demonstrated a positive relationship between hole size and contributions in the public goods game experiment.|$|E
5000|$|Behavior {{modification}} {{is based}} on methodological behaviorism, which refers to limiting behavior-change procedures <b>to</b> <b>behaviors</b> that are observable and was employed briefly during the late 1950s but predominately from the late 1970s to early 1980s.

25|$|Critical <b>to</b> <b>behavior</b> {{analytic}} interventions is {{the concept}} of a systematic behavioral case formulation with a functional behavioral assessment or analysis at the core. This approach should apply a behavior analytic theory of change (see Behavioral change theories). This formulation should include a thorough functional assessment, a skills assessment, a sequential analysis (behavior chain analysis), an ecological assessment, a look at existing evidenced-based behavioral models for the problem behavior (such as Fordyce's model of chronic pain) and then a treatment plan based on how environmental factors influence behavior. Some argue that behavior analytic case formulation can be improved with an assessment of rules and rule-governed behavior. Some of the interventions that result from this type of conceptualization involve training specific communication skills to replace the problem behaviors as well as specific setting, antecedent, behavior, and consequence strategies.|$|E
25|$|A {{particularly}} prominent {{criticism of}} strong reciprocity {{theory is that}} it does not correspond <b>to</b> <b>behavior</b> found in the actual environment. In particular, the existence of third party punishment in the field is called into question. Some have responded to this criticism by pointing out that if effective, third party punishment will rarely be used, and will therefore be difficult to observe. Others have suggested that there is evidence of third party costly punishment in the field. Critics have responded to these claims by arguing that it is unfair for proponents to argue that both a demonstration of costly third party punishment as well as a lack of costly third party punishment are both evidence of its existence. They also question whether the ethnographic evidence presented is costly third party punishment, and call for additional analysis of the costs and benefits of the punishment. Other research has shown that different types of strong reciprocity do not predict other types of strong reciprocity within individuals.|$|E
25|$|CD36's {{association}} {{with the ability to}} taste fats has made it a target for various studies regarding obesity and alteration of lipid tasting. CD36 mRNA expression was found to be reduced in taste bud cells (TBC) of obese sand rats (P. obesus) compared to lean controls, implicating an association between CD36 and obesity. Although actual levels of CD36 protein were not different between the obese and control rat cells, Abdoul-Azize et al. hypothesize that the physical distribution of CD36 could differ in obese rat cells. Changes in calcium mediation have been associated with CD36 and obesity as well. Taste bud cells (more specifically, cells from the circumvallate papillae) containing CD36 that were isolated from obese mice exhibited a significantly smaller increase in calcium after fatty acid stimulation when compared to control mice: CD36 associated calcium regulation is impaired when mice are made to be obese (but not in normal weight mice), and this could be a mechanism contributing <b>to</b> <b>behavior</b> changes in the obese mice, such as decreased lipid taste sensitivity and decreased attraction to fats.|$|E

500|$|Non-reductionist {{philosophers}} hold {{firmly to}} two essential convictions {{with regard to}} mind–body relations: 1) Physicalism is true and mental states must be physical states, but 2) All reductionist proposals are unsatisfactory: mental states cannot be reduced <b>to</b> <b>behavior,</b> brain states or functional states. Hence, the question arises whether there can still be a non-reductive physicalism. Donald Davidson's anomalous monism {{is an attempt to}} formulate such a physicalism. He [...] "thinks that when one runs across what are traditionally seen as absurdities of Reason, such as akrasia or self-deception, the personal psychology framework is not to be given up in favor of the subpersonal one, but rather must be enlarged or extended so that the rationality set out by the principle of charity can be found elsewhere." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{treatment}} of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is currently undergoing assessment and revisions to improve pregnancy outcomes of GDM women. Previous studies focused on finding new strategies {{to decrease the}} incidence of GDM complications, however, there is insufficient evidence supporting strategies that enhance adherence <b>to</b> healthy lifestyle <b>behaviors</b> among women with GDM. The purpose of this pre-test and post-test comparative experimental study (control vs. intervention) is {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of a health education intervention on improving gestational diabetes women’s self-efficacy for adherence <b>to</b> healthy <b>behaviors</b> and ability for adherence <b>to</b> healthy <b>behaviors.</b> This study was conducted at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital between October 2016 and January 2017, among Omani women with GDM. Standard prenatal care was received by the control group, the intervention group received an additional health education session and a biweekly text messages for 4 weeks. Different self-efficacy enhancing strategies (e. g., motivational messages, role modeling, goal setting, and mastery experiences) were used to encourage women to maintain the recommended healthy behaviors. Total of ninety GDM women completed both the pre-test and post-test. At baseline, no significant variances between study groups in relation to self-efficacy for adherence <b>to</b> healthy <b>behaviors</b> (t= 1. 14, p=. 62) and adherence <b>to</b> healthy <b>behaviors</b> (t= -. 80, p=. 23) were found. At post-test, the intervention group reported significant improvement in the self-efficacy score (M= 9. 89, SD= 19. 58) in comparison to the control group (M= - 1. 84, SD= 17. 58); t (88) = - 2. 99, p<. 001). The improvement in self-efficacy for adherence <b>to</b> healthy <b>behaviors</b> was not a significant predictor for the improvement in adherence <b>to</b> healthy <b>behaviors</b> (B=. 01, SE=. 01, p=. 08), controlling for the group. However, it was found that the improvement in self-efficacy for adherence <b>to</b> healthy <b>behaviors</b> partially mediates the relationship between the group assignment and the improvement in adherence <b>to</b> healthy <b>behaviors.</b> While physical limitations was the primary barrier for adherence <b>to</b> healthy <b>behaviors,</b> participants’ concern of GDM-related complications was the top motivator for adherence <b>to</b> healthy <b>behaviors.</b> The findings from this study demonstrate that the health education intervention significantly improved gestational diabetes women’s self-efficacy for adherence <b>to</b> healthy <b>behaviors</b> and their ability for adherence <b>to</b> healthy <b>behaviors.</b> Improved adherence <b>to</b> healthy <b>behaviors</b> should reflect in decreased incidence of GDM-related complications. Future examination of the data is planned that will study its effect on improving pregnancy outcomes of Omani pregnant women with gestational diabetes. Upcoming research should focus on preventing incidence of gestational diabetes through lifestyle modification interventions that incorporates self-efficacy as motivational strategy to improve adherence <b>to</b> healthy <b>behaviors...</b>|$|R
