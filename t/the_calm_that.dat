25|$|The act commences with {{a series}} of dark {{threatening}} statements from the bassoons and cellos followed by repeats of these in the clarinets and violas. Quickly, a theme forms that appears to reflect <b>the</b> <b>calm</b> <b>that</b> has remained in the castle after the brawl the night before. However, this tone is only superficial; repeated descending chromatic scales in the strings during the brief orchestral prelude create a darker atmosphere associated with the plotting of Iago.|$|E
25|$|Accented {{notes in}} the orchestra, {{particularly}} in the strings, reflect the annoyance of Otello at having his sleep disturbed. Notes played piano and pizzicato by the strings accompany Iago's account of the events, giving his account a feeling of false remorse and unhappiness. Upon Otello's orders, the disturbed islanders return to their homes, accompanied by legato {{notes in the}} upper strings and woodwinds depicting <b>the</b> <b>calm</b> <b>that</b> has once more been reestablished.|$|E
60|$|The {{inviolable}} quietness; The {{breath of}} peace we drew With its soft motion made not less <b>The</b> <b>calm</b> <b>that</b> round us grew.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} <b>the</b> <b>calm</b> {{serenity}} <b>that</b> had {{settled on the}} girl's fine countenance was disturbed.|$|R
60|$|Canaples was livid with passion, but {{otherwise}} <b>the</b> <b>calmest</b> in <b>that</b> room, saving perhaps myself. With a gesture he restrained Montmédy and St. Auban.|$|R
60|$|The {{prisoner}} {{laid his}} hand upon {{his heart and}} smiled, with <b>the</b> <b>calm</b> assurance <b>that</b> none but those who are thus sustained can feel.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why am I called, Rose," [...] {{the young}} man asked, attempering his voice to <b>the</b> <b>calm</b> <b>that</b> reigned around him; [...] "and why am I called by you?" ...|$|E
60|$|That {{evening the}} three men of us had dinner alone, with racks on the table, while the Elsinore rolled in <b>the</b> <b>calm</b> <b>that</b> had sent Miss West to her room.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>calm</b> <b>that</b> succeeded this thrilling {{incident}} {{was like a}} sudden lull {{in the midst of}} a furious storm. Even the pirates seemed to be solemnised by what had passed.|$|E
60|$|His {{tone was}} <b>the</b> <b>calm</b> one <b>that</b> <b>the</b> heroes {{used in the}} Celebrity's novels when {{they were about to}} drop on and annihilate wicked men.|$|R
6000|$|... "You need {{do nothing}} but go on your own way, and persist in your refusal," [...] he said in <b>the</b> <b>calm</b> voice <b>that</b> always {{reassured}} her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Long have I loved what I behold, [...] <b>The</b> night <b>that</b> <b>calms,</b> <b>the</b> day <b>that</b> cheers; [...] The common {{growth of}} mother-earth [...] Suffices me--her tears, her mirth, [...] Her humblest mirth and tears. [...] 135 ...|$|R
60|$|So felt Amabel, as {{she entered}} into <b>the</b> <b>calm</b> <b>that</b> {{followed}} the one year {{in which she had}} passed through the great events of life, and known the chief joy and deepest grief that she could ever experience.|$|E
60|$|It {{gave them}} pause. The change was too abrupt. They {{did not like}} it. It was as <b>the</b> <b>calm</b> <b>that</b> screens some surprise. Yet it was {{impossible}} {{he should have been}} forewarned; impossible he could have had word of how they proposed to deal with him.|$|E
60|$|She {{stood with}} her hands lightly clasped in front of her. Her grand head was raised; her soft gray eyes shone again undimmed by tears. The storm of emotion had swept over her and had passed away A sad tranquillity was in her face; a gentle {{resignation}} was in her voice. The calm of a martyr was <b>the</b> <b>calm</b> <b>that</b> confronted him as she spoke her last words.|$|E
60|$|The girl {{contemplated}} {{him with}} <b>the</b> <b>calm,</b> impersonal regard <b>that</b> befitted {{the difference in}} their stations.|$|R
60|$|But let us {{return from}} this digression, or rather, {{this series of}} digressions, {{to the point where}} we {{branched}} off: the aspect of the beacon in the fog, and <b>the</b> <b>calm</b> of <b>that</b> still morning in June.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Vane hid {{her face}} in her handkerchief, and then plucked it away, and shrieked again. She stopped, with <b>the</b> sudden <b>calm</b> <b>that</b> succeeds such a paroxysm, and, [...] "Does Mrs. Sewell know all about this?" [...] she panted.|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} {{there were very}} few ships in sight from our mast- heads--seven at most, perhaps, with a few more distant specks, hull down, beyond the magic ring of the horizon. The spell of the fair wind has a subtle power to scatter a white-winged company of ships looking all the same way, each with its white fillet of {{tumbling}} foam under the bow. It is <b>the</b> <b>calm</b> <b>that</b> brings ships mysteriously together; it is your wind that is the great separator.|$|E
6000|$|Ileen was a {{strictly}} vegetable compound, guaranteed under the Pure Ambrosia and Balm-of-Gilead Act {{of the year}} of the fall of Adam. She was a fruit-stand blonde--strawberries, peaches, cherries, etc. Her eyes were wide apart, and she possessed <b>the</b> <b>calm</b> <b>that</b> precedes a storm that never comes. But {{it seems to me that}} words (at any rate per) are wasted in an effort to describe the beautiful. Like fancy, [...] "It is engendered in the eyes." [...] There are three kinds of beauties--I was foreordained to be homiletic; I can never stick to a story.|$|E
60|$|Of all {{the changes}} that {{constantly}} vary the face of nature, <b>the</b> <b>calm</b> <b>that</b> succeeds a storm {{is one of the}} most beautiful, and the most agreeable, perhaps, to the feelings of man. Few conditions of nature convey to the mind more thoroughly the idea of complete repose--of deep rest after mortal strife, of sleep after exhausting toil; and those who have passed through the violence of the storm and done battle with its dangers are, by the physical rest which they enjoy after it is over, the more fitted to appreciate and sympathise with the repose which reigns around them.|$|E

60|$|What {{gave rise}} to this sudden piece of {{psychology}} he did not state; possibly Bosinney's, prominent forehead and cheekbones and chin, or something hungry in his face, which quarrelled with Swithin's conception of <b>the</b> <b>calm</b> satiety <b>that</b> should characterize the perfect gentleman.|$|R
6000|$|I'll trust, that, {{like the}} birds of Spring, [...] Our good goes not without repair, But only flies to soar and sing [...] Far off in some diviner air, Where we shall find it in <b>the</b> <b>calms</b> Of <b>that</b> fair garden 'neath the palms.|$|R
60|$|When {{the quiet}} of the garret had been long undisturbed, and his heaving breast and shaken form had long yielded to <b>the</b> <b>calm</b> <b>that</b> must follow all storms--emblem to humanity, of the rest and silence into which the storm called Life must hush at last--they came forward to raise the father and {{daughter}} from the ground. He had gradually dropped to the floor, and lay there in a lethargy, worn out. She had nestled down with him, that his head might lie upon her arm; and her hair drooping over him curtained him from the light.|$|E
60|$|I {{have heard}} tell of <b>the</b> <b>calm</b> <b>that</b> comes upon brave men when hope {{is dead and}} their doom has been pronounced. Uncertainty may have {{tortured}} and made cowards of them; but once that uncertainty is dissolved and suspense is at an end, resignation enters their soul, and, possessing it, gives to their bearing a noble and dignified peace. By the mercy of Heaven they are made, maybe, to see how poor and evanescent a thing is life; and they come to realise that since to die is a necessity there is no avoiding, as well might it betide to-day as ten years hence.|$|E
60|$|At {{the very}} {{commencement}} of it, there occurred {{one of those}} incidents to which all voyagers {{are more or less}} subject. A gale arose the very evening of the day on which they left port, which all but swamped the little vessel, and the violence of the wind was so great that their huge sail was split from top to bottom. In spite of the darkness and the confusion that ensued, Captain Arkal, by his prompt action and skilful management, saved the vessel from immediate destruction. Fortunately the gale did not last long, and, during <b>the</b> <b>calm</b> <b>that</b> followed, the rent was repaired and the sail re-set.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was past}} six {{when he got}} up to go, and there had not been a moment to break <b>the</b> <b>calm</b> of <b>that</b> sacred feeling in both their hearts. They parted with another {{tranquil}} look, which seemed to say: 'It is well with us--we have drunk of happiness.' ...|$|R
5000|$|As of November 2015, Joachim Rønneberg, age 96, was {{the last}} {{surviving}} member of the Gunnerside team. The New York Times reported that Rønneberg was [...] "still mentally sharp at his advanced age and still possessed of <b>the</b> unflappable <b>calm</b> <b>that</b> so impressed British military commanders more than 70 years ago".|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{would not}} have it {{otherwise}} for worlds. <b>The</b> <b>calm</b> reliance <b>that</b> makes her a ministering spirit is far too lovely to be ruffled by {{a hint of the}} controversies that weary my brain. If it be effect of credulity, the effects are more beauteous than those of clear eyesight.' ...|$|R
60|$|There was a deep, solemn stillness around, that irresistibly and powerfully {{conveyed}} to her mind {{the idea of}} rest. The long, gentle undulation of the deep did {{not in the least}} detract from this idea. So perfect was <b>the</b> <b>calm,</b> <b>that</b> several masses of clouds in the sky, which shone with the richest saffron light, were mirrored in all their rich details as if in a glass. The faintest possible idea of a line alone indicated, in one direction, where the water terminated and the sky began. A warm golden haze suffused the whole atmosphere, and softened the intensity of the deep-blue vault above.|$|E
6000|$|... 4. How calm it was!--the silence there By such a chain {{was bound}} That even the busy {{woodpecker}} [...] 35 Made stiller by her sound The inviolable quietness; The breath of peace we drew With its soft motion made not less <b>The</b> <b>calm</b> <b>that</b> round us grew. [...] 40 There seemed from the remotest seat Of the white mountain waste, To the soft flower beneath our feet, A magic circle traced,-- A spirit interfused around [...] 45 A thrilling, silent life,-- To momentary peace it bound Our mortal nature's strife; And still I felt {{the centre of}} The magic circle there [...] 50 Was one fair form that filled with love The lifeless atmosphere.|$|E
60|$|But this {{deceitful}} quiet {{was only}} <b>the</b> <b>calm</b> <b>that</b> precedes the storm. On every hand men were busily engaged in making preparation {{to break that}} Sabbath day in the most frightful manner, or were calmly, but resolutely, awaiting attack. On board the ship-of-war, indeed, there was little doing, for, her business being to fight, she was always {{in a state of}} readiness for action. Her signal guns, fired the previous night, had recalled Montague to tell him of the threatened attack by the savages. A few brief orders were given, and they were prepared for whatever might occur. In the village, too, the arrangements to repel attack having been made, white men and native converts alike rested with their arms placed in convenient proximity to their hands.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{can hear}} no more {{discussion}} on this point,' answered Philip, in <b>the</b> serious, <b>calm</b> tone <b>that</b> showed {{so much power}} over himself and every one else.|$|R
60|$|It is pleasant, it {{is profoundly}} enjoyable, {{to sit on}} the margin of the sea during <b>the</b> dead <b>calm</b> <b>that</b> not unfrequently succeeds a wild storm, and watch the gentle {{undulations}} of the glass-like surface, which the very gulls seem to be disinclined to ruffle with their wings as they descend to hover above their own reflected images.|$|R
60|$|The skipper of the Lively Poll kept himself {{better in}} hand than his men, but, being very sociable in disposition, {{and finding the}} Dutchman a humorous and chatty fellow, he {{saw no reason to}} hurry them away. Besides, his vessel was close alongside, and nothing could be done in the fishing way during <b>the</b> dead <b>calm</b> <b>that</b> prevailed.|$|R
