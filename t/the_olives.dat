5|$|During Roman times, Volubilis {{was a major}} {{producer}} of olive oil. The remains of buildings dedicated to olive pressing are still readily visible, as are {{the remains of the}} original presses and olive mills. One such building has been reconstructed with a full-size replica of a Roman olive press. Olive oil was central {{to the life of the}} city, as it was not just a foodstuff but was also used for lamps, bathing and medicines, while the pressed olives were fed to animals or dried out and used as fuel for the bathhouses. For this reason, even some of the grandest mansions had their own olive presses. Fifty-eight oil-pressing complexes have so far been discovered in Volubilis. They housed a standard set of elements: a mill, used to crush <b>the</b> <b>olives,</b> a decantation basin to catch the oil from pressed olives, and a press that comprised a counterweight, a prelum or cross-bar and the wooden supports within which the prelum was fixed. <b>The</b> <b>olives</b> were first crushed into a paste, then put into woven baskets that were subjected to pressing. The olive oil ran out into the decantation basin, to which water was periodically added to make the lighter oil float to the surface. This was then scooped out of the basin and poured into amphorae. There is also substantial evidence of the city being a lively commercial centre. No fewer than 121 shops have been identified so far, many of them bakeries, and judging from the number of bronzes found at the site it may also have been a centre for the production or distribution of bronze artworks.|$|E

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Agronómica - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe {{olive tree}} {{has been an}} {{important}} culture spread all over Portugal throughout the years. <b>The</b> table <b>olive</b> and <b>the</b> <b>olive</b> oil are products with strong ties to the Portuguese tradition. The main objective of this thesis is to contribute to a real characterization of <b>the</b> <b>olive</b> orchards and <b>the</b> <b>olive</b> oil sector in Portugal continental. To make an exact and realistic characterization of the above sectors it was necessary to identify the main characteristics of the production regions: type, age and education of the producers, main varieties and types of <b>olive</b> orchards, <b>the</b> evolution of <b>the</b> <b>olive</b> mills, and <b>the</b> evolution of the product’s quality and commercialization. <b>The</b> <b>olive</b> orchards in Portugal are mostly traditional, composed by old trees and with low production levels. Almost all over <b>the</b> country <b>the</b> <b>olive</b> orchards are characterized by their small areas, advanced age, and the producers have typically basic education levels. Only in the Alentejo region it is possible to find a satisfactory number of olive orchards with larger areas and producers with average instruction levels. The main production regions in Portugal are Alentejo and Trás-os-Montes. These two regions comprise 60 % of <b>the</b> country's <b>olive</b> orchard's area and 70 % of <b>the</b> country's <b>olive</b> production. <b>The</b> major investments in modern olive orchards, and in the upgrade of <b>the</b> old <b>olive</b> orchards, also occur in Alentejo and Trás-os-Montes. After several years on which <b>the</b> <b>olive</b> orchards have been abandoned or replaced by other cultures, mainly vineyards, <b>the</b> <b>olive</b> production in Portugal is recovering the importance of the past. The most noticeable evolution has been happening in Alentejo and Trás-os-Montes, but Beira Interior and Lisboa e Vale do Tejo have also been working to increase the production and quality of their olive oil. Since Portugal joined the European Union the quality of <b>the</b> <b>olive</b> oil increased considerably; in order to comply with to the European standards <b>the</b> <b>olive</b> mills were required to enhance and modernize their facilities and machinery. Mainly due to a more favourable climate and to a more resistant specie of olive tree, Trás-os-Montes is the region with <b>the</b> best <b>olive</b> oil quality in Portugal. In the other regions, mostly in Alentejo, where Galega Vulgar is <b>the</b> main <b>olive</b> tree, there is a decrease in <b>the</b> <b>olive</b> oil quality. This happens {{as a result of the}} high vulnerability of the Galega Vulgar to plagues and diseases. Despite the overallquality of <b>the</b> <b>olive</b> oil has been increasing, it is necessary to use more effective approaches in the prevention of plagues and diseases in <b>olive</b> orchards. <b>The</b> optimistic forecasts for <b>the</b> <b>olive</b> oil market make <b>the</b> <b>olive</b> oil sector one of the few agricultural sectors with a good/great margin for improvement in Portugal. Given that Portugal occupies the eighth position in <b>the</b> <b>olive</b> oil producers’ world ranking, <b>the</b> <b>olive</b> tree has become a strategic culture in the Portuguese agriculture. <b>The</b> Portuguese <b>olive</b> oil sector and <b>the</b> <b>olive</b> orchards are currently facing multiple changes. This thesis characterizes the reality of these changes in today’s Portuguese agriculture, and it aims to become a reference for future studies...|$|R
25|$|Water-cured type (olives with fermentation): Applied to green, semiripe, or ripe olives, {{these are}} soaked in water or weak brine and this {{solution}} is changed {{on a daily}} basis for 10–14 days.

Once packed in salt, fermentation is minimal and only initiated by the most halophilic yeast species such as Debaryomyces hansenii. Once cured, they are sold in their natural state without any additives. So-called Oil-cured olives are cured in salt, and then soaked in oil.|$|E

25|$|Karaite Judaism {{defines the}} Arba`at haMinim {{somewhat}} differently than Rabbinic Jews, i.e. (1) fruit of splendorous tree (Peri `Eṣ Hadar), which {{need not be}} the Etrog (yellow Citrus fruit) demanded by Rabbinic law, yet may be either any seasonal fruit tree considered splendorous by an individual Jew, or branches of olive trees featuring <b>the</b> <b>olives,</b> that were considered splendorous by the Judean Israelites in the generation of Nehemiah, as seen in Neḥemyah 8; (2) date palm fronds (Kappoth Temarim) instead of the closed palm frond used by Rabbinical Jews; (3) branches of thickly leaved trees (‘Eṣ ‘Avoth) which may be from fig, laurel and Eucalyptus rather than myrtle branches only; and (4) willow branches (‘Aravoth Naḥal) e.g. Maple, Oak, Yew and Butternut, {{as opposed to the}} Rabbinically dictated willow tree's boughs. Karaite Jews have always understood the Arba`at haMinim to be used for the purpose of constructing the roof of the Sukkah (pl. Sukkot); they are not made into a lulav and shaken in six directions, as is the Rabbinic practice. In the book of Nehemiah (8:15), the Israelites are instructed to construct their Sukkot out of the four species: olive branches and oil tree branches (fruit of splendorous tree), as well as date palm fronds, myrtle branches and branches of thickly leaved trees are mentioned in the same passage as materials for the Sukkah's construction.|$|E

2500|$|Spanish or Sevillian type (olives with fermentation): Most {{commonly}} {{applied to}} green olive preparation, around 60% {{of all the}} world's table olives are produced with this method. Olives are soaked in lye (dilute NaOH, 2–4%) for 8–10 hours to hydrolyse the oleuropein. They are usually considered [...] "treated" [...] when the lye has penetrated {{two-thirds of the way}} into the fruit. They are then washed once or several times in water to remove the caustic solution and transferred to fermenting vessels full of brine at typical concentrations of 8–12% NaCl. The brine is changed on a regular basis to help remove the phenolic compounds. Fermentation is carried out by the natural microbiota present on <b>the</b> <b>olives</b> that survive the lye treatment process. Many organisms are involved, usually reflecting the local conditions or [...] "Terroir" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>olives.</b> During a typical fermentation gram-negative enterobacteria flourish in small numbers at first, but are rapidly outgrown by lactic acid bacteria species such as Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis and Pediococcus damnosus. These bacteria produce lactic acid to help lower the pH of the brine and therefore stabilize the product against unwanted pathogenic species. A diversity of yeasts then accumulate in sufficient numbers to help complete the fermentation alongside the lactic acid bacteria. Yeasts commonly mentioned include the teleomorphs Pichia anomala, Pichia membranifaciens, Debaryomyces hansenii and Kluyveromyces marxianus. Once fermented, <b>the</b> <b>olives</b> are placed in fresh brine and acid corrected, to be ready for market.|$|E
