40|$|For millennia {{people have}} speculated {{about the nature}} of time—without success. Time plays a role with all {{processes}} and events studied by all the disciplines. It is reported here that the existence of time is a direct consequence of the existence of space. Space exists, and it continues to exist. Space is there, and it continues to be there. Space exists as place, the three-dimensional place that matter can occupy. The three-dimensional extension of spatial-place is measured with a ruler of some kind. Place, three-dimensionality, and extension are intrinsic-qualities of space itself. The continuing-existence of space is a direct consequence of the existence of space. The continuing-existence of space is measured with a clock. Spatial continuing-existence also has intrinsic-qualities. A list of <b>the</b> <b>qualities</b> of <b>the</b> continuing-existence of space appears to be the same as a list of <b>the</b> <b>qualities</b> of time. Seventeen <b>qualities</b> of <b>the</b> continuing-existence of space are compared to <b>the</b> equivalent <b>qualities</b> of time.

She reacts towards men in such way because she is being provoked. However, Katherine?s failure in fulfilling <b>the</b> <b>qualities</b> of `ideal? is not her fault.
