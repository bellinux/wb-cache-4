5|$|After the {{plaintiff}} rests, {{the defense lawyer}} calls Marcy, Al, and Peggy to the stand. She asks Marcy a series of embarrassing questions, hoping to prove Marcy knew that the camera was there. Her tactic with the Bundys {{is to try to}} prove sexual intercourse did not occur on the videotape. In the end, the Rhoades are awarded $10,000 but the Bundys receive nothing, because the jury does not believe that sex occurred. After everyone exits <b>the</b> <b>courtroom,</b> Al attempts to prove that he can perform when he wants to and has sex with Peggy for hours on the judge's bench, unwittingly while being recorded by <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> camera.|$|E

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>courtrooms</b> {{vary from}} {{as large as}} [...] to as small as [...] and are in a pear-shaped design. Designs for <b>the</b> <b>courtrooms</b> were partly based on <b>the</b> <b>courtrooms</b> of <b>the</b> Bordeaux Law Courts in France. The jury box is {{recessed}} and does not resemble a traditional jury box. <b>The</b> <b>courtrooms</b> feature ribbons of wood panels on the walls in rooms that narrow as they reach the bench at the front. The wood is primarily cherry with walnut accents. Natural light is let into <b>the</b> <b>courtrooms</b> from small opening in the walls. Videoconferencing is available in <b>the</b> <b>courtrooms.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>courtrooms</b> {{have been}} altered over time. <b>The</b> second-story <b>courtroom</b> was {{previously}} partitioned for office space, but converted {{back to a}} single room in 1972, although neither the furniture nor the finishes were restored. <b>The</b> third-floor <b>courtroom</b> retains its original plan. The cornice, doors, windows, radiator enclosures, and bench remain, although other original finishes have been removed or covered.|$|R
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> scene, the Kool-Aid Man is seen {{breaking}} through a wall, which later became a running gag in the series involving a certain character or {{breaking through}} a wall and Peter's job as a Mascot is a parody of the Cocoa Puffs commercial.|$|E
5|$|Work {{was carried}} out between 1616 and 1733, {{bringing}} the castle back into good order. As part of this, the spine wall was rebuilt properly, and the second floor windows enlarged. <b>The</b> <b>courtroom</b> featured a chair for the Stannary court judge, additional seating for the court officials and a railed, public section around {{the outside of the}} room. <b>The</b> <b>courtroom</b> also doubled as a hall for village dances and feasts. At the start of the 19th century, however, Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt, the Lord Warden of the Stannaries, began the construction of Dartmoor Prison at Princetown. Dartmoor Prison and Princetown grew increasingly important and courts began to be held there instead of Lydford Castle.|$|E
5|$|According to Simon Goldhill, the {{evidence}} is fundamentally inconclusive. Goldhill writes that the theatre {{can be seen as}} a social and political event analogous with the Assembly and <b>the</b> <b>courtroom,</b> and women may have been excluded. David Kawalko Roselli writes that although Goldhill's perspective is valuable, he does not sufficiently consider the theatre's ritual purpose. If women did attend the theatre, they may have sat separately from the men.|$|E

The body was taken back to <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> at Shire Hall, where it was slit open along the abdomen to expose the muscles. The crowds were allowed to file past until six o'clock, when the doors were shut. According to the Norwich and Bury Post, over 5,000 people queued to see the body.|$|E
5|$|In 1833, the Tolpuddle Martyrs {{founded the}} Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers.

Dorchester Prison was constructed in the town during the 19th century and was used for holding convicted and remanded inmates from the local courts until it closed in December 2013.

40|$|Abstract for {{the volume}} Contributors to <b>The</b> Divine <b>Courtroom</b> in Comparative Perspective treat {{one of the}} most {{pervasive}} religious metaphors, that of <b>the</b> divine <b>courtroom,</b> in both its historical and thematic senses. In order to shed light on the various manifestations of <b>the</b> divine <b>courtroom,</b> this volume consists of essays by scholars of the ancient Near East, Hebrew Bible, Second Temple Judaism, early Christianity, Talmud, Islam, medieval Judaism, and classical Greek literature. Contributions to the volume primarily center upon three related facets of the divine courtroom: the role of <b>the</b> divine <b>courtroom</b> in <b>the</b> earthly legal system; <b>the</b> divine <b>courtroom</b> as <b>the</b> site of historical justice; and <b>the</b> divine <b>courtroom</b> as <b>the</b> venue in which God is called to answer for his own unjust acts...|$|R
5|$|Justice Stark then {{reviewed}} {{the evidence and}} advised the jury that in his opinion the weight of psychiatric evidence favoured the defence; however, he reminded them, {{it was up to}} them to decide. The jury retired at 16:30 on 20 January 1967 to make their decision, and returned to <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> shortly before 19:00 to give their verdict. They found Lamb to be {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity. Lamb showed no reaction when the verdict was read.|$|E
5|$|Once he is released, Samuel {{returns to}} his {{ministry}} and attempts to heal {{a woman in a}} wheelchair. However, she suffers a seizure and dies, which leads to Samuel's second arrest. An autopsy reveals the woman died of cyanide poisoning, whilst Mulder and Scully find evidence that the swarm of locusts, which were actually common grasshoppers, was guided by someone to <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> through the building's ventilation system. Mulder believes Samuel to be innocent. However, the local sheriff, Maurice Daniels, allows two of his men to beat Samuel to death in his cell.|$|E
5|$|Samuel {{eventually}} {{turns up}} drunk {{at a local}} bar, his faith shaken by the death. He is taken into custody. The agents doubt his ability, but {{he is able to}} convince Mulder that he knows the latter has lost a sister—Samantha—at a young age. Mulder has been seeing visions of Samantha, and continues to see them. At Samuel's bail hearing, <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> fills with a swarm of locusts, which Samuel claims is a sign of God's wrath against him.|$|E
50|$|The annex {{includes}} two new <b>courtrooms</b> on <b>the</b> fourth floor, and space for additional <b>courtrooms</b> on <b>the</b> second floor. <b>The</b> <b>courtrooms</b> are notable for their spatial design. Each courtroom is organized along an implied axis connecting the jury deliberation room, judge's bench, courtroom entrance, and major {{features in the}} public atrium. Fully accessible witness and jury boxes are set to one side. Clerestory windows above the jury box introduce daylight into <b>the</b> <b>courtrooms.</b>|$|R

Marble finishes and terrazzo floors are reserved for <b>the</b> <b>courtrooms</b> and <b>the</b> corridors in the first floor. Interior finishes in the 1931-32 addition reveal the reduced or — stripped — classical style of the era, {{as seen in the}} abstracted designs in the terrazzo flooring and the flattened moldings used for the door framing.|$|R
5|$|The Oregon Supreme Court (OSC) is {{the highest}} state court in the U.S. state of Oregon. The only court that may reverse or modify a {{decision}} of the Oregon Supreme Court is the Supreme Court of the United States. The OSC holds court at the Oregon Supreme Court Building in Salem, Oregon, near the capitol building on State Street. The building was finished in 1914 and also houses the state's law library, while <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> is also used by the Oregon Court of Appeals.|$|E
5|$|The inquest into Sandra Rivett's death {{opened on}} 13November 1974 and {{was led by}} the Coroner for Inner West London, Gavin Thurston.

At Ranson's request, the hearing was then adjourned. Further adjournments were made on 11December 1974 and 10March 1975, before a full inquest was scheduled for 16June 1975.|$|E
5|$|Tucker's {{effectiveness}} in the lecture hall is not objectively certain, {{and he may}} well have encountered difficulty with public speaking as he had in <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> previously. His continued faculty chairmanship certainly testified to his relative popularity among colleagues, and he published numerous works—including one satire, a fiction, three books on economics and statistics, a Jefferson biography, {{as well as two}} pamphlets. Together with Robley Dunglison he founded and edited the Virginia Literary Museum (1829–1830) in which he published voluminous writings; and he frequently sent essays to newspapers and magazines.|$|E

5|$|While {{the first}} trial was under way, events outside <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> {{influenced}} public perception of communism: the Soviet Union tested its first nuclear weapon, and communists prevailed in the Chinese Civil War. Public opinion was overwhelmingly against the defendants. After a 10 month trial the jury found all 11 defendants guilty and the judge sentenced them to terms of {{up to five years}} in federal prison, further sentencing all five defense attorneys to imprisonment for contempt of court. Two of the attorneys were subsequently disbarred.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial doubts by Nintendo's American staff, Donkey Kong succeeded commercially and {{critically}} in North America and Japan. Nintendo licensed {{the game to}} Coleco, who developed home console versions for numerous platforms. Other companies cloned Nintendo's hit and avoided royalties altogether. Miyamoto's characters appeared on cereal boxes, television cartoons, {{and dozens of other}} places. A lawsuit brought on by Universal City Studios, alleging Donkey Kong violated their trademark of King Kong, ultimately failed. The success of Donkey Kong and Nintendo's victory in <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> helped to position the company for video game market dominance from its release in 1981 until the late 1990s (1996–1999).|$|E
5|$|During the trial, the {{prosecution}} alleged bribery and witness tampering {{attempts by the}} Frank legal team. Meanwhile, the defense requested a mistrial because it believed the jurors had been intimidated by the people inside and outside <b>the</b> <b>courtroom,</b> but the motion was denied. Fearing {{for the safety of}} Frank and his lawyers in case of an acquittal, Roan and the defense agreed that neither Frank nor his defense attorneys would be present when the verdict was read. On August 25, 1913, after less than four hours of deliberation, the jury reached a unanimous guilty verdict convicting Frank of murder.|$|E
