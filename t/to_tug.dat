5|$|Several {{observers}} (including Plait and Tyson) {{said that}} in the scene in which Kowalski unclips his tether and floats away to his death to save Stone from being pulled away from the ISS, Stone would simply need <b>to</b> <b>tug</b> the tether gently to pull Kowalski toward her. According to the film's science adviser Kevin Grazier and NASA engineer Robert Frost, however, the pair are still decelerating with Stone's leg caught in the parachute cords from the Soyuz. The cords stretch as they absorb her kinetic energy. Kowalski thinks that the cords are not strong enough to absorb his kinetic energy as well as hers, and that he must release the tether to give Stone a chance of stopping before the cords fail and doom both of them.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} hyenas, the spotted hyena shows a greater {{relative}} amount of frontal cortex which {{is involved in}} the mediation of social behavior. Studies strongly suggest convergent evolution in spotted hyena and primate intelligence. A study done by evolutionary anthropologists demonstrated that spotted hyenas outperform chimpanzees on cooperative problem-solving tests; captive pairs of spotted hyenas were challenged <b>to</b> <b>tug</b> two ropes in unison to earn a food reward, successfully cooperating and learning the maneuvers quickly without prior training. Experienced hyenas even helped inexperienced clan-mates to solve the problem. In contrast, chimps and other primates often require extensive training, and cooperation between individuals is not always as easy for them. The intelligence of the spotted hyena was attested to by Dutch colonists in 19th-century South Africa, who noted that hyenas were exceedingly cunning and suspicious, particularly after successfully escaping from traps. Spotted hyenas seem to plan on hunting specific species in advance; hyenas have been observed to indulge in activities such as scent marking before setting off to hunt zebras, a behaviour which does not occur when they target other prey species. Also, spotted hyenas have been recorded to utilise deceptive behaviour, including giving alarm calls during feeding when no enemies are present, thus frightening off other hyenas and allowing them to temporarily eat in peace. Similarly, mothers will emit alarm calls in attempting to interrupt attacks on their cubs by other hyenas.|$|E
25|$|Two 300-ton weights sit at {{opposite}} ends of the 58th floor of the Hancock. Each weight is a box of steel, filled with lead, 17 feet square by 3 feet high. Each weight rests on a steel plate. The plate is covered with lubricant so the weight is free to slide. But the weight is attached to the steel frame of the building by means of springs and shock absorbers. When the Hancock sways, the weight tends to remain still, allowing the floor to slide underneath it. Then, as the springs and shocks take hold, they begin <b>to</b> <b>tug</b> the building back. The effect is like that of a gyroscope, stabilizing the tower. The reason there are two weights, instead of one, is so they can tug in opposite directions when the building twists. The cost of the damper was $3 million. The dampers are free to move a few feet relative to the floor.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} was not void of criticism. Although Richard Corliss of Time thoroughly enjoyed the film, {{he felt that}} too much {{emphasis was placed on}} Flynn Rider and not enough on Rapunzel. Corliss questioned the future of Disney's animated heroines, writing, [...] "For 60 years ... girls were the focal characters who could be expected to come of age, triumph over adversity and, in general, man up," [...] and accused various film studios of [...] "abolish female-centered stories." [...] Variety's Justin Chang described Rapunzel as a [...] "bland, plastic" [...] heroine, likening her to a Barbie doll. Similarly, Tom Huddleston of Time Out described Rapunzel as [...] "bland". James Berardinelli of ReelViews was fairly mixed in his review, writing, [...] "although likeable and energetic, [...] is not as memorable as Snow White, Ariel, or Belle." [...] Keith Uhlich of Time Out described the character as [...] "synthetic". He wrote, [...] "you never feel like you're watching a girl on the empowering cusp of adulthood so much as a selection of attitudes compiled through demographic study." [...] The Independents Anthony Quinn panned the character, describing her as [...] "bland and Valley Girlish". Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch opined, [...] "when the big-eyed heroine tries <b>to</b> <b>tug</b> at our heartstrings and Flynn turns into Prince Charming, the too-familiar hero-and-damsel motif feels like a fashion faux-pas." [...] Similarly, the SouthtownStars Jake Coyle wrote, [...] "Both Rapunzel and Flynn too much resemble Barbie and Ken, lacking both superficial and emotional individuality." [...] Jen Yamato of Movies.com criticized Disney for [...] "failing to give Rapunzel a backbone and retreading ground so familiar you can fall asleep for ten minutes and still know exactly what happened".|$|E

2500|$|His writing {{style is}} marked by a profuse {{linguistic}} creativity. Satire, flourishing in his gift for caricature, is his forte. An early reviewer compared him to Hogarth for his keen practical sense of the ludicrous side of life, though his acclaimed mastery of varieties of class idiom may in fact mirror the conventions of contemporary popular theatre. Dickens worked intensively on developing arresting names for his characters that would reverberate with associations for his readers, and assist the development of motifs in the storyline, giving what one critic calls an [...] "allegorical impetus" [...] to the novels' meanings. To cite one of numerous examples, the name Mr. Murdstone in David Copperfield conjures up twin allusions to [...] "murder" [...] and stony coldness. His literary style is also a mixture of fantasy and realism. His satires of British aristocratic snobbery—he calls one character the [...] "Noble Refrigerator"—are often popular. Comparing orphans to stocks and shares, people <b>to</b> <b>tug</b> boats, or dinner-party guests to furniture are just some of Dickens's acclaimed flights of fancy.|$|E
