25|$|By early May, the Bouamlong fortifications had {{deteriorated}} into a military slum. The ADC militia, being home guards, had their families <b>there</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> In total, there were almost 6,000 Hmong crowded onto the valley floor. The area {{was littered with}} castoff parachutes and other military debris. The stink of rotting Vietnamese corpses permeated the atmosphere. An improvised Royal Lao Army (RLA) battalion of 435 soldiers, composed of units plucked from other battalions, was airlifted into this. Four days later, 116 of its troopers quit and were evacuated. On 24 May, Bataillon Commando 205 (BC 205) was choppered in to replace the makeshift battalion; on the return trips, the departing troops were flown out. On 29 May, the newcomers moved out toward Phou Then. Air strikes by Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF) T-28s and U.S. Air Force A-1s cleared their way in daylight. At night, AC-47 gunships provided defensive fire. A freshly arrived 105mm howitzer lent additional fire support. By 18 June, the outpost had been retaken, and the drive ended.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Bernthal stated that Walsh was suffering from the [...] "loneliness you feel when you're right <b>there</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> and you can't be {{with them in the}} way you want." [...] Bernthal applauded the writers for such changes, and felt that the storyline never devitalized. [...] "The people that Shane loved more {{than anyone else in the}} world before the apocalypse are still very much alive and still very much with him, but he'll never be with them in the way he wants to and the way he once was. Every relationship—Shane/Carl, Shane/Lori and Shane/Rick—it's tainted and fractured. When you suffer from that kind of loneliness, it brings out the worst in you." ...|$|E

500|$|Nixon {{established}} transition {{headquarters in}} New York, but Agnew was {{not invited to}} meet with him there until November 27, when the two met for an hour. When Agnew spoke to reporters afterwards, he stated that he felt [...] "exhilarated" [...] with his new responsibilities, but did not explain what those were. During the transition period, Agnew traveled extensively, enjoying his new status. He vacationed on St. Croix, where he played a round of golf with Humphrey and Muskie. He went to Memphis for the 1968 Liberty Bowl, and to New York to attend the wedding of Nixon's daughter Julie to David Eisenhower. Agnew was a fan of the Baltimore Colts; in January, he was the guest of team owner Carroll Rosenbloom at Super Bowl III, and watched Joe Namath and the New York Jets upset the Colts, 16–7. There was as yet no official residence for the vice president, and Spiro and Judy Agnew secured a suite at the Sheraton Hotel in Washington formerly occupied by Johnson while vice president. Only one of their children, Kim, the youngest daughter, moved <b>there</b> <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> the others remaining in Maryland.|$|E
500|$|Wenger praised his team's {{character}} and told reporters: [...] "We were very frustrated last year. We {{have shown a}} lot of strength {{to come back here}} – beating Liverpool and Newcastle on the way." [...] He was adamant Arsenal would win the league the following Wednesday: [...] "This team knows how to win. I said three or four months ago that we will win the championship and the FA Cup. They really want to do it. And we will do it." [...] The goalscorers Parlour and Ljungberg both agreed winning at any cost was most important on the day, after the misery of the 2001 final. Ranieri described the first half as tactical, but admitted once Arsenal had scored, Chelsea struggled to make a comeback. He justified his decision to include Hasselbaink, saying [...] "He is a great striker and a danger to the opposition." [...] Lampard credited Arsenal's mental strength: [...] "They can win when they are not playing particularly well. We need to find that consistency and if we can do that, I believe we will be up <b>there</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> soon." [...] He was pleased with his own performance against Vieira and hoped he did enough to be included in England's World Cup squad.|$|E
2500|$|Zorn's file-card {{method of}} {{organizing}} sound blocks into an overall structure largely {{depended on the}} musicians he chose, the way they interpreted what was written on the file cards, and their relationship with Zorn. [...] "I'm {{not going to sit}} in some ivory tower and pass my scores down to the players." [...] said Zorn, [...] "I have to be <b>there</b> <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> and that's why I started playing saxophone, so that I could meet musicians. I still feel that I have to earn a player's trust before they can play my music. At the end of the day, I want players to say: this was fun—it was a lot of fucking work, and it's {{one of the hardest things}} I've ever done, but it was worth the effort." ...|$|E

60|$|Beasley's evil genius {{had planned}} this abduction. Riggs was a tool, a cowardly knave {{dominated}} by a stronger will.
