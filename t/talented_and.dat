5|$|Alessandro Farnese, as Paul III, was {{the last}} of the popes {{appointed}} by the ruling Medici family of Florence. He was socially ambitious, a careerist and not particularly pious. He kept a concubine, fathered four children out of wedlock and viewed the throne as an opportunity to fill his coffers while he placed his relatives in high positions. A <b>talented</b> <b>and</b> cunning political operator, Paul was precisely the sort of man the Florentines needed to assist them in their defence against French and Spanish threats.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact that teacher attitudes and {{experiences}} have on their understandings {{of the social and}} emotional characteristics and needs of gifted <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> children. It addresses the issues within Aotearoa New Zealand Primary school settings. The study used a mixed methodology approach. Quantitative data was collected in the form of questionnaires to collect information from a range of participants and to identify potential participants for individual interviews. More in-depth qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews conducted with four teachers. The findings suggest that many teachers are uncertain about the social and emotional characteristics and needs of gifted <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> children. Teachers expressed positive attitudes towards gifted <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> children while acknowledging their lack of personal knowledge about gifted <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> education. The findings also identified teachers‘ frustrations at barriers affecting their ability to support gifted <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> children‘s social <b>and</b> emotional needs in their classroom programmes, including, limited personal knowledge and skills, lack of professional development, lack of time to spend with gifted <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> children, <b>and</b> school directed priorities for meeting the needs of other children. The findings of this study have implications for teachers wanting to support gifted <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> children, educators interested in the social and emotional needs of gifted <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> children, <b>and</b> those responsible for gifted <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> education (GATE) programmes and GATE professional development. It would seem that it is highly desirable for all teachers to have professional development in gifted <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> education, in order to better understand social and emotional aspects, and thereby provide a more supportive environment where gifted <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> children can learn and grow...|$|R

He felt that Carey represented both.

5|$|Tactically, Pirlo {{was capable}} of playing in several midfield positions, but was usually {{deployed}} by his club and national sides as a central midfielder, {{in the role of}} a deep-lying playmaker, due to his vision and passing accuracy. A highly technical and creative player, Pirlo is regarded by players, managers, and pundits {{as one of the greatest}} ever players in his position, as one of the best midfielders in the world and of his generation, and as one of the greatest Italian players of all time. He started his career in a more advanced role, as an offensive midfielder, and also played as a supporting striker on occasion. Although he was considered a talented young prospect, even drawing comparisons with former Italian footballer Gianni Rivera, Pirlo occasionally struggled in this role, due to his lack of pace, and competition from other <b>talented</b> <b>and</b> more dynamic players in his position.|$|E
5|$|The year 1956 was {{not very}} {{different}} from 1955 for Koufax. Despite the blazing speed of his fastball, Koufax continued to struggle with his control. He saw little work, pitching only 58.7 innings with a 4.91 ERA, 29 walks and 30 strikeouts. When Koufax allowed baserunners, he was rarely permitted to finish the inning. Teammate Joe Pignatano said that, as soon as Koufax threw a couple of balls in a row, Alston would signal for a replacement to start warming up in the bullpen. Jackie Robinson, in his final season, clashed with Alston on Koufax's usage. Robinson saw that Koufax was <b>talented</b> <b>and</b> had flashes of brilliance, and objected to Koufax being benched {{for weeks at a}} time.|$|E
40|$|This survey {{evaluates the}} {{effectiveness}} of strategies used by primary schools and local authorities to support and challenge more able <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> pupils. Overall, most more able <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> pupils are not challenged enough and too few pupils achieve above the expected levels {{at the end of}} key stages 1 and 2. Provision for more able <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> pupils varies too much across Wales. In the few primary schools with the best provision, thorough analysis of data and assessment outcomes helps to identify more able <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> pupils. In these few schools, more able <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> pupils are supported through a range of additional provision and their progress tracked and monitored carefully. Parents understand the school’s approach to providing additional support for more able <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> pupils. More able <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> pupils gain most in schools that promote individualised or personalised approaches to learning and they benefit particularly from having control over how and what they learn. However, in the majority of primary schools, more able <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> pupils are not identified and do not receive appropriate support. Teachers in these schools do not have the expertise to identify, support or track the progress of more able <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> pupils. Transition arrangements between primary and secondary schools often do not provide enough continuity and progression in the education of more able <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> pupils. Few local authorities use data to monitor the progress of more able <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> pupils or promote the sharing of best practice between schools. School improvement officers rarely discuss more able <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> pupils during their visits to schools. " - page 1...|$|R

He {{found it difficult to}} control the club's <b>talented</b> <b>and</b> popular players, as Dziekanowski regularly got into trouble in his social life and skilled left-winger Junior Bent was unwilling to deliver crosses as regularly as Smith demanded. He tried to sell Bent but was unable to have the deal sanctioned by the club's directors. His relationship with the board was poor and he found himself regularly undermined and sensitive boardroom discussions were leaked. He also tried to sell Cole in order to provide funds to restructure the first team but again the board refused to sanction the deal. He was dismissed on 21 January 1993 following a run of 10 matches without a victory, and his assistant Russell Osman was appointed as his successor.|$|E
5|$|Manstein {{remained}} {{in the armed forces}} after the war ended. In 1918 he volunteered for a staff position with the Frontier Defence Force in Breslau (now Wroclaw) and served there until 1919. As part of Gruppenkommando II, he participated in the restructuring of the German Imperial Army of 500,000 men into the Reichswehr, the army of the Weimar Republic (restricted to 100,000 men by the Versailles Treaty). Recognised from an early age as a <b>talented</b> <b>and</b> intelligent commander, Manstein was chosen as one of only 4,000 officers permitted under the treaty. In 1921 he was appointed company commander of the sixth company of the 5th Prussian Infantry Regiment and next served as a staff officer for Wehrkreiskommando II and IV, teaching military history and tactics until 1927. That year he was promoted to major and served with the General Staff at the Reichswehr Ministry in Berlin, visiting other countries to learn about their military facilities and helping to draft mobilisation plans for the army. Promoted to lieutenant colonel, he was given command of the light infantry battalion of the 4th Infantry Regiment, serving with that unit until 1934. In 1933 the Nazi Party seized power in Germany, thus ending the Weimar period. In violation of the Versailles treaty, the Reichswehr had been secretly re-arming since the 1920s; the new government formally renounced the Treaty and proceeded with large scale rearmament and expansion of the military.|$|E
