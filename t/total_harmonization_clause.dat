40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to give a broad {{analysis}} of changes in the field of consumer protection law in the European Union over three decades. In 2004, the European Commission launched a project of reviewing consumer law in order to strengthen consumers’ confidence in the internal market and to encourage businesses to conduct cross-border trading. The EU consumer protection regulatory framework is based on directives including a minimum <b>harmonization</b> <b>clause.</b> This clause allows Member States to maintain or adopt stricter consumer protection rules and leads to fragmentation in their national laws. For instance, it was found that the notion and definition of a consumer has been designed for use by a specific directive, depending on which area is covered by the regulation of the personal scope. The definition of the so-called weaker party in a contractual relationship is understood in a narrow way, which is highlighted in the established line of the European Court of Justice case law. A brief outline of the history of the shaping of consumer protection policy in the European Union is presented to demonstrate how the problem of amending consumer protection law has evolved in the EU as well as increased in importance; this has been demonstrated in several programs and resolutions of the European Parliament and communications of the European Commission, which discuss the need to reform consumer contract law. The Proposal for a Horizontal Directive on Consumer Rights is the result of a review of consumer law acquis communautaire, referred to as the Consumer Acquis, and aims at introducing a full <b>harmonization</b> <b>clause</b> where feasible. Until recently, the norms governing the determination of the law applicable to consumer contracts have been defined by the Rome Convention of 1980 on the law applicable to contract relations. Due to its overly casuistic nature and outdated provisions relating to consumer contracts, it was decided to amend the Convention, which was changed into the Rome I Regulation...|$|R
40|$|The tax {{harmonization}} is {{a complex}} issue {{in the process of}} European integration. The tax harmonization is a process of convergence of the tax system based on mutual set of rules and, in general, it means existence of identical or similar tax rates for the tax payers in European Union, i. e. Euro zone. In case there are identical tax rates, then we are talking about a, so called, <b>total</b> explicit tax <b>harmonization,</b> whereas, if there are similar tax rates, we are talking about partial explicit tax harmonization, which refers to determination of the highest and the lowest tax rates. Thus, countries can determine the tax rates of certain taxes. The <b>total</b> <b>harmonization,</b> besides tax rates harmonization, means structural harmonization or harmonization of the tax structure. The harmonization of direct taxes mainly relies on the following main objectives: avoiding tax evasion and elimination of double taxation. The harmonization of regulations and directives in the field of indirect taxes is necessary in terms of establishing a single market, or removal of barriers to the free movement of goods, people, services and capital. ...|$|R

Jurisdictions face different refugee in ows. We show that the resulting varying levels of strictness of the eligibility criteria create a legal externality which leads to a "race to the bottom", or a toughening, of asylum standards. They are stricter than the Pareto efficient level. To solve this problem, we consider two forms of harmonization: fixed and minimum standards. We find no proof that either type would lead to a better result for the member countries than national asylum law making. However, the system of minimum standards is clearly best for refugees, and that it is and better than <b>total</b> <b>harmonization</b> for both host countries. competition in law making, asylum law, European law, human rights. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the necessity to}} consider the role of private rule making and the increasing importance of national regulatory agencies, {{in the process of}} European legal integration. It then focuses on the legislative design and process implementation of EPL. Its departing assumption is that EPL is and will remain a multilevel system where national implementation of European legislation generates intentional and unintentional spillover effects to be ‘governed’ through horizontal devices. The author underlines that the current legislative and judicial trend towards <b>total</b> <b>harmonization</b> is the wrong response to normative differentiation occurring in the process of national implementation. He analyses in particular the areas of unfair contract terms and commercial practices, providing examples of divergent implementation which can not be tackled only at legislative level, claiming that governance is a better response. He examines traditional modes of governance and then considers the applicability of new modes of governance to EPL. He makes several reform proposals; most of them do not require legislative intervention. At the legislative level, given that the competences are organised around policy areas while private law, following the national traditions, is conceptually organised around institutions, he proposes different ways to improve coordination at the Commission level, concerning legislative draft. Legislative drafting can also be improved by considering the different impacts of new legal categories in national legal systems, especially the general clauses. At the implementation level he emphasizes the role of judicial governance and the lack of coordination among national judiciaries proposing the establishment of a permanent judicial conference specialised in EPL to be coordinated with TFI and ECJ. He then proposes the institution of committees operating according to subjects (contract, property, tort) that would cut across directorates competences and would analyse the impact of European legislation on private law national systems. Finally he proposes the use of OMC, adequately redefined to evaluate the policy effects of implementation especially when it involves national regulatory agencies. governance...|$|R
40|$|The {{idea of an}} {{inevitable}} process of centralization in the European Community (EC) /European Union (EU) is a myth. Also, the metaphor of creeping competences, with its suggestion of a surreptitious but continuous growth of {{the powers of the}} Commission, can be misleading. It is true that the functional scope of EC/EU competences has steadily increased, but the nature of new competences has changed dramatically, as may be seen from the evolution of the methods of harmonization. The original emphasis on <b>total</b> <b>harmonization,</b> which gives the Community exclusive competence over a given policy area, has been largely replaced by more flexible but less communitarian methods such as optional and minimum harmonization, reference to nonbinding technical standards, and mutual recognition. Finally, the treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam explicitly excluded harmonization for most new competences. Thus, the expansion of the jurisdiction of the EC/EU has not automatically increased the powers of the Commission, but has actually weakened them in several respects. In addition, the progressive parliamentarization of the Commission risks compromising its credibility as an independent regulator, without necessarily enhancing its democratic legitimacy. Since the member states continue to oppose any centralization of regulatory powers, even in areas essential to the functioning of the internal market, the task of implementing Community policies should be entrusted to networks of independent national and European regulators, roughly modeled on the European System of Central Banks. The Commission would coordinate and monitor the activities of these networks in order to ensure the coherence of EC regulatory policies. More generally, it should bring its distinctive competence more clearly into focus by concentrating on the core business of ensuring the development and proper functioning of the single European market. This is a more modest role than that of the kernel of a future government of Europe, but it is essential to the credibility of the integration process and does not overstrain the limited financial and legitimacy resources available to the Commission...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} trade liberalization and environmental protection, focusing on how conflicts between these policy domains may be alleviated and made mutually reinforcing, especially {{in the context of}} regional trade agreements. Part II describes the various concerns that the parallel pursuit of trade liberalization and environmental protection have raised. Part III suggests a taxonomy of responses to the tensions between trade and environmental policy outlined in Part II. The nature and characteristics of these tools and strategies vary considerably, consistent with the diverse set of concerns to which they respond. The spectrum of strategies ranges from total non-integration of environmental policies and a 2 ̆ 2 laissez-faire 2 ̆ 2 approach to differences in environmental standards across jurisdictions, to <b>total</b> <b>harmonization</b> of environmental standards, which requires a high degree of regulatory integration. Part IV applies the theoretical framework outlined in Parts II and III to two regional trade agreements, the EC and NAFTA. This Article examines, in particular, {{the extent to which the}} trade and environment concerns discussed in Part II have arisen in these two agreements, as well as the degree to which the responses discussed in Part III have been used to address these concerns. Part V discusses the extent to which the experience with regional trade agreements might apply to the trade and environment issues arising in the context of the World Trade Organization (the 2 ̆ 2 WTO 2 ̆ 2). Part VI offers some general conclusions. Specifically, we suggest that trade liberalization and advanced economic integration require some degree of integration in other realms, including environmental regulation. Fortunately, there are a variety of policy tools-especially various forms of regulatory harmonization-available to respond to this need. Those who assume that harmonization implies uniform standards, and thus dismiss it as inefficient, fail to appreciate the range of effective and refined strategies for policy coordination. We observe that the EC could benefit from valuable lessons in NAFTA, and NAFTA could learn from EC experiences in the reconciliation of competing trade and environmental goals. Finally, those pursuing future trade liberalization in either regional or multilateral agreements could profit from examining the successes and failures of the EC and NAFTA...|$|R

Those collections include mainly local cultivars from their respective regions, covering {{most of the}} Spanish apple-growing areas. Though some previous studies about the genetic variability of apple genetics resources from Spain were already performed, a complete analysis is {{needed in order to}} evaluate the complete diversity of Malus spp. in Spain. For doing that, the Spanish Government funded the project ¿Harmonization of the methodology of characterization, assessment of genetic diversity and definition of the core collection of the apple germplasm conserved in Spanish genebanks¿. In total, we have evaluated 1206 accessions using standardized methodologies, with SSR markers and morphological descriptors. SSR fingerprinting was performed with 13 SSR markers. SSR profiles were obtained independently and allele sizes were compared using a common set of cultivars selected as references. Results showed 601 genotypes for 1206 accessions. Most of the genotypes (438) were identified only in one accession. The other 163 genotypes were repeated in two to 81 accessions (involving 767 accessions in <b>total).</b> The <b>harmonization</b> of morphological descriptors will allow us to determine if the accessions with the same genotype are synonymies or closely related individuals.

40|$|Background: The {{increased}} {{globalization and}} trade over domestic borders within the European Union (EU) has {{lead to the}} implementation of new international accounting standards. This is necessary to create an effective capital market, where comparisons between companies located in different countries can be made, due to a more harmonized accounting. Obstacles to overcome when establish a more harmonized accounting in the EU is for example different accounting backgrounds and valuation methods. Purpose: The purpose of the thesis is to as far possible study whether the establishment of IAS 40 contributes to an increased harmonization and more comparable accounting of investment property for listed companies within the EU. Method: This thesis involves both a quantitative –and a qualitative research method. We have used primary data in forms of interviews, and secondary data in forms of annual reports, regulations, literature and articles in the thesis. Using both primary –and secondary data results in a higher reliability and validity. Frame of reference: There are two alternative valuations methods according to IAS 40, the cost –and the fair value model. The cost model means a valuation to historical cost minus depreciation. Valuation in compliance to the fair value model on the other hand means that the investment property shall be valuated to market value. When using the cost model a note of the fair value shall be included in the financial statement. A company has according to IAS 40 the possibility to choose between internal –or external valuation when estimating the fair value. Empirical results and analysis: Our empirical result is presented mainly through annual reports from listed investment property companies in Sweden, England and Germany. We found that the fair value model was used by all the analysed companies in Sweden and England in 2005, the year of the implementation of IAS 40 in the EU. By analysing the annul reports from the investment property companies we found indications that the fair value model also tends to become the generally excepted valuation model in Germany. Furthermore, our empirical result shows {{that a majority of the}} Swedish investment property companies regularly used internal valuation, but there is a pattern of external valuation as a complement to the internal valuation. In England and Germany all investment property companies used external valuation and there was no use of internal valuation even as a complement to the external valuation. Conclusions: Based on our empirical results we draw the conclusion that the accounting for listed investment property companies within the EU is more harmonized and comparable today than before the implementation of IAS 40 in 2005. However, IAS 40 gives the companies the possibility to decide weather to use the cost –or the fair value model and the use of external valuation is optional. This can be viewed as obstacles to achieve a <b>total</b> <b>harmonization</b> of the accounting within the EU for listed investment property companies. From our empirical findings we draw the conclusion that the fair value model tends to become the generally excepted valuation model within the EU. Also, we do not perceive the use of the cost model as a barrier to the harmonization process because the fair value still has to be left in a not in the financial statement. However, we believe that in order to achieve a more harmonized and more comparable accounting for listed investment property companies within in the EU a directive about a minimum of external valuation must be included in IAS 40. This in order to avoid companies to use only internal valuation of the properties as this may effect the result...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{need for}} {{equivalent}} results of rou-tine measurement {{procedures for the}} alcohol bio-marker carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) has been recognized by the IFCC. This article describes a project to harmonize CDT as conducted by an IFCC working group initiated for this purpose. METHODS: Weused procedures for achieving harmoniza-tion as developed by the Consortium for Harmonization of Clinical Laboratory Results to assess the suitability of a candidate reference measurement procedure (cRMP), candidate reference materials (cRMs), {{and the success of}} efforts to achieve harmonization. RESULTS: CDTmeasurement procedures in routine use showed good reproducibility (CV 1. 1 %– 2. 8 %) and lin-earity (r 0. 990) with variable slopes (0. 766 – 1. 065) and intercepts (0. 34 – 0. 92) compared to the cRMP. Heterogeneity after simulated harmonization was 4. 7 %. cRMs of frozen human native sera demonstrated commutability and 3 -year stability for routine mea-surement procedures. The cRMP provided reproduc-ible value assignment to cRMs with an expanded un-certainty (k 2) of 0. 03 % at the 1. 2 % CDT level and 0. 06 % at the 4. 4 % CDT level. Harmonization efforts reduced the intermeasurement CV from 8. 8 % to 3. 4 %, allowed 99 % recovery of the values assigned with the cRMP, and demonstrated 99 % of results within the desirable allowable <b>total</b> error. <b>Harmonization</b> was less successful in samples with low CDT and high trisialo-transferrin concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Harmonization of CDT is possible with frozen human native sera as cRMs with values assigned by use of the cRMP. We propose the cRMP as a candi-date international conventional reference measure-ment procedure and cRMs as candidate international calibrators...|$|R
40|$|Notwithstanding the {{differences}} in the specific regulations, some foodstuffs (i. e., natural mineral waters, foodstuffs for particular nutritional uses, food supplements, enriched or fortified foods and functional foods) have in common the production of a positive physiological effect, due to a set of characteristics naturally present in said products or which can be reproduced by the manufacturer. The properties of these products aim at satisfying a specific health need of the consumer. In order to define a specific category of foodstuffs as health foods based on their intrinsic properties, the shared purpose of said foodstuffs must be to produce a positive effect on human health. The health function (understood to be the ability of the foodstuff to produce positive effects on the human body under normal conditions due to its nutritional and/or physiological benefits) constitutes a true requirement for quality, no longer linked to a specific foodstuff, but rather identifying properties common to a category of foods, where said properties are declared through appropriate claims on labelling, addressed to the final consumer and capable to orientate the decision of purchase. A comprehensive category of health food is still not expressly defined as such within the EU legal framework, and can therefore be specified only through interpretation. Recognition of the category could help to solve some relevant issues on the production and marketing of foodstuffs beneficial to human health, assuring coherence with high standards in protecting human health and the efficient circulation of goods in a free market. European legislation has traditionally introduced specific directives to regulate product description, composition, manufacture, control, authorization and labeling/advertising for the various types of health foods, but whenever food products include substances whose use is not harmonized at European level recognition of their beneficial health effects can raise barriers to the free circulation in the European market. These barriers can take the form of authorizations required by Member States prior to the introduction in the market, in order to protect consumers’ health, and can also be due to different national classification of health foods, in some cases as foodstuffs, in others as medicinal products. Bringing the multiple legislation approved for single foodstuffs beneficial to health within one comprehensive systemic category would render these laws more meaningful and complementary in order to overcome the uncertainties, that undermine the border between medicinal products and foodstuffs. In addition, it would help to identify the mechanisms needed to overcome impasses in the circulation of goods within the European Union through indirect harmonization. Such harmonization favours new standardization processes, that can be pursued by the private sector (e. g. through non-compulsory nutritional and health information foreseen in Regulation No 1924 / 2006) or by the Commission itself and the Member States (e. g. by the procedure regulated in Article 8 of Regulation No 1925 / 2006). We may therefore assume that a commonly accepted definition of health food is that it produces positive effects on human health if used as intended, but it is not able to appreciably restore, correct or modify physiological functions by exerting a pharmacological, immunological or metabolic action, nor does it have the function of treating or preventing disease. Health food can be marketed through the use of claims, established by national or Community legislation, or defined by food business operators and authorized by the Commission in compliance with the provisions set forth in Regulation No 1924 / 2006. In the absence of <b>total</b> <b>harmonization</b> of the legislation regulating health food claims at the Community level, a voluntary alignment of State Members legislation to the guarantees, required by Regulation No 1924 / 2006 for the use of nutrition and health claims for foodstuffs, would foster a reduction in trade barriers in the European internal market...|$|R

In Zambia, numerous questions are being raised by the public regarding the status and credibility of town planning vis-à-vis the changing socio-economic investment environment experienced in the urban areas, especially, Lusaka, Ndola, Kitwe, Livingstone and Solwezi. With this backdrop, the paper attempted to address the nature of town planning practice by planners that seems to hinder the effectiveness of the activity to guiding and directing social, economic and physical infrastructure development in urban areas in Zambia. The consequence is that, there is no effective town planning practice in Zambia, particularly in the districts and hence, to re-examine the flaws and provide pragmatic but dynamic solutions.

40|$|This essay {{focuses on}} rule-making {{procedures}} in European Contract Law {{and the role}} of self-regulation. Self-regulation may serve different purposes in this respect: it operates as a standard-setting mechanism for contracts, in particular through standardisation; it may interpret European and national law offering firms and consumers guidelines: and finally it contributes to monitoring the conduct of contracting parties to ensure compliance, and it provides enforcement mechanisms. Self-regulation plays already a significant role at European level, it is already relevant for European Contract Law and may perform important functions in the process of drafting the Common frame of references and more broadly in the process of harmonisation of ECL. This paper addresses self-regulation as a complementary means to harmonize and regulate ECL. Two main choices may characterize the use of self-regulation as a means of harmonising European Contract Law. On the one hand, self-regulation can be a partial or a <b>total</b> device for <b>harmonization,</b> i. e. (a) it can be a complement to hard or soft law harmonisation or (b) it can, in certain areas, substitute hard law harmonization. On the other hand, self-regulation can be general and/or sector specific, i. e. it can operate within the general Common Frame of reference or it can specify the general standard forms to be used for individual sectors, unregulated or regulated (banking, insurance, securities). The choice between the first two alternatives, complementarity or substitution will partly depend on the form of legislation. The role of self-regulation will increase in a principle-based legislative framework and decrease in a rule-based framework. In practical terms self-regulation operates both as a complement and as a substitute. It is a complement when it specifies or interprets existing legislation. It is a substitute when harmonises, by means of Standard contract forms, Framework contracts or Master Agreements, contractual relationships otherwise regulated at State level in different fashions. In turn {{from the perspective of the}} State or the European institutions the use of self-regulation in ECL may imply a functional change: from the ‘theoretical’ monopoly of law making to a duopoly. But the change could be even more radical if the public legislator, be it at European or national level, becomes a coordinator and/or a mediator among different self-regulatory bodies, negotiating among themselves contract law rules. The evolution of the regulatory state in Europe will probably affect which combination between these two identities will emerge in the next future. The main aims of the paper are (1) to demonstrate the necessity to consider self-regulation as a significant component of the debate concerning the definition of Common Frame of References related to European Contract law, (2) to identify the role and the limits of self-regulation in the formation of European Contract Law, and (3), more in general, to show the strong correlation between the governance of self-regulatory bodies and the substance of European Contract Law...|$|R
