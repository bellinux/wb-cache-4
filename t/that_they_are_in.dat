Jack {{believes}} the Others are also stranded just as he is, but Ben informs him of the exact time and date of his plane crash and that 69 days have since passed (making the date November 29, 2004) and insists <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> contact with the outside world. He shows this by citing various current events, such as the re-election of George W. Bush to the American presidency, the sudden death of Christopher Reeve and that the Boston Red Sox have won the 2004 World Series. Once Ben tells him about the Red Sox, Jack starts laughing and says that proves he is lying. Ben then proves it by playing a recording of the final play in the game as Jack watches in shock.|$|E

A demonic prison guard tells them <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> the Nightosphere, the hellish realm ruled by Marceline's (voiced by Olivia Olson) father, Hunson Abadeer (voiced by Martin Olson).

5|$|Liberty {{ships were}} an {{expedient}} {{solution to a}} pressing problem, and it was never intended that they last more than five years. It is remarkable that two (SS John W. Brown and SS Jeremiah O'Brien) have not only survived seventy plus years of service, but <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> 'like-new' condition, and {{are open to the}} public as museums. The British needed a way to replace the ships lost to German U-boats, but did not have the resources to build them. In 1939, they asked the United States to help solve the problem, bringing a ship design that they wanted built. The design was modified to fit American production methods, and five new shipyards were built to give the shipbuilding industry capacity. These ships were called Ocean ships with each ship's name starting with Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Theta Muscae is {{a triple}} star system {{thought to be}} around 7,500light-years distant. It {{consists}} of a spectroscopic binary system composed of the Wolfâ€“Rayet star (spectral type: WC5 or 6) and an O-type main-sequence star (spectral type: O6 or O7) that orbit each other every 19 days and a blue supergiant (spectral type: O9.5/B0Iab) set about 46milliarcseconds apart from them. If the system's estimated distance from Earth is accurate, the binary stars are about 0.5astronomical units (AU) apart and the supergiant about 100AU apart from them. All three are highly luminous: combined, {{they are likely to}} be over a million times as luminous as the Sun. TU Muscae is a binary star system located around 15,500light-years away made up of two hot luminous blue main sequence stars of spectral types O7.5V and O9.5V, with masses 23 and 15times that of the Sun. The stars are so close <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> contact with each other (overcontact binary) and are classed as a Beta Lyrae variable as their light varies from Earth as they eclipse each other. The system ranges from apparent magnitude 8.17 to 8.75 over around 1.4days.|$|E
