5|$|After {{graduating from}} the U.S. Naval Academy in 1867, Sebree was posted {{to a number of}} vessels before being {{assigned}} to a rescue mission to find the remaining crew of the missing Polaris in the Navy's first mission <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arctic.</b> This attempt was only a partial success—the Polaris crew was rescued by a British ship rather than the US Navy—but this led to Sebree's selection eleven years later for a second expedition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arctic.</b> That mission to rescue Adolphus Greely and the survivors of the Lady Franklin Bay expedition was a success. Sebree was subsequently appointed as the second acting governor of American Samoa. He served in this position for only a year before returning to the United States. In 1907, he was promoted to rear admiral and given command of the Pathfinder Expedition around the South American coast before being appointed commander of the 2nd Division of the Pacific Fleet and then commander-in-chief of the entire fleet. He retired in 1910 and died in Coronado, California, in 1922. Two geographical features in Alaska—Sebree Peak and Sebree Island—are named for Admiral Sebree.|$|E

5|$|Common loons {{are mainly}} Nearctic, and breed from 48° N <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> Circle, locally south to 40° N and north to 78° N. During their {{breeding}} season {{in spring and}} summer, most common loons live on lakes and other waterways in the northern United States and Canada, {{as well as in}} southern parts of Greenland, in Iceland, in Svalbard, in Jan Mayen, and in Bear Island in Norway; and in Alaska, to the west, and very rarely in Scotland, to the east. Their summer habitat ranges from wooded lakes to tundra ponds. The lakes must be large enough for flight take-off, and provide a large population of small fish. Deep lakes with warm surface waters, relatively low biological productivity and low turbidity where their fish prey are easy to see are habitats where breeding loons are more successful in raising young. For protection from predators, common loons favour lakes with islands and coves. They are rare visitors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> coast. They are known to exhibit high breeding site fidelity.|$|E
5|$|From early 1942 Tirpitz posed a {{significant}} {{threat to the}} Allied convoys transporting supplies through the Norwegian Sea to the Soviet Union.

5|$|One tourism {{activity}} unique <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> North is iceberg watching.

In addition, watching the floe edge is also a popular activity due to wildlife movement during this time. Whales can often be seen swimming metres from the ice, polar bears can be observed swimming briefly in the icy water and amphibious animals often bring themselves up onto dry land or onto the ice to sunbathe.|$|E

After a failed second expedition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> Circle, he became involved in archaeology. In his capacity as Keeper of Anglo-Saxon Antiquities at the Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Lethbridge carried out excavations at various sites around Britain. His claims regarding the existence of Iron Age hill figures on Wandlebury Hill in Cambridgeshire caused significant controversy within the archaeological community, with most archaeologists believing that Lethbridge had erroneously misidentified a natural feature. Lethbridge's methodology and theories were widely deemed unorthodox, and in turn he became increasingly critical of the archaeological profession.|$|E
5|$|Collybia cookei {{is found}} in Europe, Asia (Japan), and North America. The European {{distribution}} extends north <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> Circle and the Lofoten Islands. The species is widely distributed in North America; it was reported from Mexico {{for the first time}} in 1998. The fungus is partial to mixed forest dominated by aspen and conifers in montane and subalpine environments. In The Netherlands, it was a component of one of three communities of saprobic fungi associated with roadside verges (the land between the road edge and the adjacent wall, fence or hedge) planted with common oak (Quercus robur); the verges also supported the growth of the mushroom Russula ochroleuca, a host of C.cookei.|$|E

5|$|In the Cretaceous, {{a shallow}} seaway spread into the {{interior}} of North America from the Gulf of Mexico in the south into Utah and later <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> Ocean in the far north. Geologists call this shallow sea the Cretaceous Seaway or Western Interior Seaway. The seaway divided North America into two halves: an eastern portion dominated by the already ancient Appalachian Mountains and a western part composed primarily of the still growing Sevier Mountains; formed from shallow thrust faulting caused by the Sevier orogeny. As the shoreline moved back and forth, the Bryce area alternated from {{being part of the}} Sevier landmass to being under the Cretaceous Seaway. Alternating layers of nonmarine, intertidal, and marine sediments lay {{on top of each other}} as a result.|$|E
5|$|Many butterflies, such as {{the painted}} lady, monarch, and several danaine migrate for long distances. These migrations take place {{over a number of}} generations and no single {{individual}} completes the whole trip. The eastern North American population of monarchs can travel thousands of miles south-west to overwintering sites in Mexico. There is a reverse migration in the spring. It has recently been shown that the British painted lady undertakes a 9,000-mile round trip in a series of steps by up to six successive generations, from tropical Africa <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> Circle — almost double the length of the famous migrations undertaken by monarch. Spectacular large-scale migrations associated with the monsoon are seen in peninsular India. Migrations have been studied in more recent times using wing tags and also using stable hydrogen isotopes.|$|E
5|$|Mountains {{continued}} to rise in the Sevier orogenic belt to the west during the Cretaceous while the roughly north-south trending Western Interior Basin expanded. Rifting in the Gulf of Mexico helped {{the southern end of}} the basin to subside, which allowed marine water to advance northward. At the same time, the shoreline advanced inland from the Arctic region. The seas advanced and retreated many times during the Cretaceous until one of the most extensive interior seaways ever, called the Western Interior Seaway, drowned much of western North America from the Gulf of Mexico <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> Ocean. The western shoreline of the seaway was in the vicinity of Cedar City, Utah while the eastern margin was part of the low-lying, stable platform ramp in Nebraska and Kansas.|$|E
