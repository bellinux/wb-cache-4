50|$|For the new store (as {{with the}} Glaspaleis) {{inspiration}} was sought throughout Europe, including {{visits to the}} US and Sweden (especially the redevelopment of the Stockholm city centre {{and its effect on}} shopping was a good example because it was better adapted to the European situation). The new store wasn't just much bigger, but featured an extended assortment, a selection one would expect of a modern warehouse store. Clothing, Schunck's mainstay, was still dominant on floors 1 (children), 2 (ladies) and 3 (gents) (with 47 fitting rooms). In the Glaspaleis, customers were welcome to {{have a cup of coffee}} at the penthouse (serviced by the family themselves), but now this was professionalised to a complete lunchroom for 180 people at the fourth floor. The other half of that floor featured toys and interior furnishings, also something that was already present at the Glaspaleis. Offices and the canteen were on the top floor. The new sections, however, were located at the two lowest floors. The ground floor featured merchandise like stationery (and many pocket books), perfume and suitcases and a patisserie with its own bakery (all self-service, except for the bonbons, which had to be weighed). The souterrain housed a 2600 m² supermarket, with 7000 items on sale and an assortment ranging from Russian caviar to 70 types of cheese. Extra efficiency was achieved at the seven checkout counters by using two trolleys (and no conveyor belt). A cashier would move the items from one trolley to the other and the customer could then take that to one of the 53 'packaging tables' (with assistance for those who desired it), thus reducing waiting time at the counter. The region is known for its high demand for quality meat. The butchery in the supermarket had a <b>total</b> <b>counter</b> length of 45 m, and a freezer with a capacity of 10.000 kg of meat. This and the other cooled storage rooms (e.g., for fruit and dairy products) were serviced by a monorail, suspended from the ceiling. This, combined with automated weighing and packaging machines (with a capacity of 10,000 packages of meat per day and shrink-wrap for fruit) meant that the food did not need to be touched by human hands, which had its advantages for hygiene. Nevertheless, there were constantly 7 butchers at work.|$|E

Three phase boundary (TPB) lengths and Ni surface areas are quantatively identified {{on the basis of the}} active, dead-end, and isolated phase clusters throughout coarsening. Tortuosity evolution of the pores is also investigated. We find that phase clusters with larger characteristic length evolve slower than those with smaller length scales. As a result, coarsening has small positive effects on transport, and impacts less on the active Ni surface area than the <b>total</b> <b>counter</b> part.

40|$|The {{cross section}} for the photoproduction of neutral pions from complex nuclei at small angles has been {{measured}} {{in an attempt}} to determine the π° lifetime from the reaction γ + γ → π° where one of the photons is provided by the Coulomb field of the nucleus.

Both of the decay gamma rays from the pions were detected in <b>total</b> absorption <b>counters</b> so that an angular distribution of the pions could be calculated from the detector geometry and the partition of energy between the two counters. The cross section appears to be dominated by production from the individual nucleons adding coherently, leaving the nucleus in its ground state. The effects from the Coulomb production at the smallest angles allow us to exclude lifetimes shorter than 2 x 10 ^(- 17) sec and longer than 1. 5 x 10 ^(- 16) sec. Because there is the possibility of systematic effects we quote the best value for the lifetime with large errors as 7. 6 ^(+ 6. 0) _(- 4. 5) x 10 ^(- 17) sec. The large coherent nuclear production indicates that the non-spin flip part of the nucleon cross section is peaked at small angles.

40|$|CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, {{operates}} {{high energy}} accelerators for particle physics research. Because of beam losses and subsequent particle interactions, radioactivity can be induced in certain accelerator components. Material and waste {{taken out of}} the accelerators facilities as a result of maintenance repair and upgrade actions as well as in case of decommissioning needs to be radiologically classied for future handling. Depending on the level of residual activity, some of these components are candidates for clearance from regulatory control in Switzerland. The Swiss radiation protection ordinance sets as criteria for clearance of material and waste from regulatory control the compliance with radionuclide specic limits for surface contamination and for specic activity as well as an ambient dose equivalent rate criterion. For objects with a mass below 1 kg a radionuclide specic clearance limit for total activity has to be respected. This work is focused on the specic activity criterion, whereby the Swiss clearance limits for specic activity correspond to the exemption limits for specic activity. The clearance from regulatory control performed at the exit of the facility is special, mainly due to the restricted infrastructural conditions and a limited time budget. In most cases the measurement has to be non-destructive, i. e. without measurements of disassembled subcomponents or sampling works for detailed mechanical, chemical or radiochemical analysis. In addition, some information of the complete activation process might not be available, e. g. the irradiation time prole, the chemical material composition or the object location when {{it has been in the}} facility. The present work tackles this challenge by dening enveloping conditions and parameter sets that allow to perform material clearance measurements, even without a detailed knowledge of object characteristics and radiological history. Representative input parameter ranges, e. g. reference material compositions or irradiation conditions, were determined and used for the calculation of the resulting radionuclide inventories. More than 28000 radionuclide inventories were calculated, analysed and visualized. A 600 -page report containing these data supplements this work. It was studied whether the detection limit of a <b>total</b> gamma <b>counter,</b> based on six large area scintillation detectors (RADOS RTM 661 / 440 lnc, produced by Mirion Technologies, Germany), is suciently low to reliably detect the radioactivity that corresponds to the clearance limits for the calculated radionuclide inventories. The gamma-ray signal per Swiss clearance limit was determined for the calculated radionuclide inventories of all selected reference materials and for all considered irradiation conditions and compared to the detection limit of the RADOS RTM 661 / 440 lnc. To include the detector response in the calculations, a photon energy dependent eciency function was determined for the <b>total</b> gamma <b>counter.</b> The dependence of the signal strength on the various parameters was analysed and the most conservative resulting radionuclide inventories, i. e. the ones with the lowest detectable gamma-ray signal per clearance limit, were identied and categorised by material as well as by irradiation condition. These enveloping radionuclide inventories allow performing clearance measurements, even without a detailed knowledge of object characteristics and radiological history. Furthermore, self-absorption eects as a function of the object geometry and material density were quantied by Monte-Carlo simulations and integrated in the clearance method by specifying self-absorption factors. The gamma-ray signal per Swiss clearance limit of the considered common materials for objects with a mass of 1 kg, the most penalising mass conguration according to the Swiss radiation protection ordinance, is above the detection limit of the RADOS RTM 661 / 440 lnc, even if the clearance limit is dominated by radionuclides that have no measurable gamma-ray emission. Consequently, by using the developed characterization method, this device can be used for the clearance of material and waste from CERN's accelerator facilities from Swiss regulatory control for the present Swiss clearance limits in force...|$|R
40|$|Hepatocyte {{suspensions}} prepared from inbred male Wistar-Kyoto rats were transplanted to the livers of syngeneic recipients by injection {{into the}} portal venous system immediately after partial hepatectomy. Donor cells were labelled with V r it 1 ritru before transplantation. Animals were sacrificed 1 hr, 10 hr, 48 hr, or 1 week later and the liver radioactivity {{was measured in}} a gamma <b>counter.</b> <b>Total</b> liver radioactivity declined rapidly during the first 10 hr after transplantation, and then stabilized. After I week, 15 - 20 % of the injected radioactivity still remained, indicating that this fraction of the injected cells was retained by the liver. The percentage was unaffected {{by the number of}} cells injected. In another experiment, lo 6 hepatocytes from a carcinogen-treated rat were transplanted to syngeneic rats fed 0. 05 % phenobarbital in the diet. Recipients developed liver carcinomas from 7 weeks after transplantation, and at 5 months 4 out of 5 animals showed severe debility and had large hepatocellular carcinomas. This model generates tumors considerably faster than those previously described, and is well suited {{for the study of the}} tumorigenic potential of subclasses of cells in liver carcinogenesis...|$|R
