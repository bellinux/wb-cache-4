5|$|Having {{won seven}} {{titles in the}} league's 18 seasons, the most {{successful}} club during this period is Maccabi Haifa; {{during the same period}} Maccabi <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv</b> have added four to their total while Beitar Jerusalem and Hapoel <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv</b> have won two championships each. Although Hapoel <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv</b> have only finished top of the league twice since 1999—in 1999–2000 and ten years later in 2009–10—they have won the double on both occasions.|$|E
5|$|Maccabi <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv</b> have {{a record}} 23 cup titles, {{followed}} by Hapoel <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv,</b> who have 15, including two unmatched runs of {{three in a row}} (1937 to 1939, and 2010 to 2012). The sustained good performance of Beitar Jerusalem, the next most successful team in terms of State Cup wins with seven, is a relatively recent occurrence compared to the two major <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv</b> clubs: Maccabi and Hapoel <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv</b> have been consistently successful throughout the cup's history, but Beitar Jerusalem only reached their first finals in the 1970s. Hapoel Kfar Saba are presently the only club with more than one final appearance to hold an undefeated record in these matches, having won the cup final three times, every time they have reached it. By contrast, three-time finalists Shimshon <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv</b> have yet to lift the trophy. The most decisive cup final victory was in 1942, when Beitar <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv</b> beat Maccabi Haifa 12–1.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1948 war the Arab {{orchards}} to {{the east}} of <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv</b> were opened for development, and the military started using the Sde Dov airport on a regular basis. The airport regained its commercial operations, initially serving domestic flights, mostly to single customers, on Piper Cub aircraft. It later expanded operations to scheduled service on larger aircraft to various parts of Israel. As a result of the land availability, an additional, northsouth, runway was built with no opposition. By 1960, land in <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv</b> became scarce, and the municipality demanded that the airport be relocated northward, so as to allow residential development in its place. However, a committee that investigated in 1961 the options for such a relocation found no feasible site in proximity to <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv</b> and suggested that flights be moved to Lod airport (now known as Ben Gurion Airport), and that road access from <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv</b> to Lod be improved. This option, however, was blocked by the Israel Defense Forces.|$|E

5|$|The 21st century {{began with}} two more cup titles for Maccabi <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv,</b> before two seasons in a row saw {{respective}} firsts for the Israel State Cup. In 2003 Hapoel Ramat Gan became the first side to win the cup final from outside the top division, {{and a year later}} Bnei Sakhnin became the first club from a mostly Arab-Israeli town to lift the trophy. Three more second-tier clubs, Hapoel Haifa, Maccabi Herzliya and Hapoel Ashkelon, reached the final in 2004, 2005 and 2007 respectively, but none of these won the deciding match. Following Bnei Sakhnin's victory teams from Jerusalem and <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv</b> reclaimed dominance—Maccabi <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv</b> lifted the cup in 2005, Beitar Jerusalem won two titles in a row in 2008 and 2009 and Hapoel <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv</b> twice in a row in 2006 and 2007, and then three times consecutively from 2010 to 2012.

Hapoel Kfar Saba, Maccabi Haifa, Beitar Jerusalem and Bnei Yehuda <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv</b> all won their first titles during the 1980s. After Bnei Yehuda's victory in 1989–90, Maccabi Haifa, Maccabi <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv</b> and Beitar Jerusalem dominated {{the remainder of}} the top-flight Liga Leumit era, winning every title except the last; the 1998–99 championship was won by first-time victors Hapoel Haifa.|$|E

5|$|In 1937, {{the mayor}} of <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv</b> Israel Rokach asked the British mandate {{authorities}} for permission to create an airport in Palestine, promising to solve the transportation problem of Jews during the Arab revolt of 193639 when travelling from <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv</b> through Arab territory to the main airport at Lydda, to catch Palestine Airways flights to Haifa, was difficult and dangerous. Works began on a plot of land north of the Yarkon River, <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv</b> and when completed in October 1938, the airport served regular flights to Haifa, with the option of flights to Beirut. In 1940, the airport's name was changed to Sde Dov, in memory of Dov Hoz, {{one of the pioneers}} of Jewish aviation. Sde Dov was abandoned after Palestine Airways ceased operations in August 1940 and the site was used as a British Army base until December 1947 when with British permission the runway was reopened by Haganah.|$|E

5|$|The 3rd Parachute Brigade was {{the first}} unit of the Airborne Division to arrive in Palestine, {{disembarking}} at Haifa on 3 October 1945. The brigade then moved to Gaza to acclimatise and regain their fitness after the voyage from England. On 21 October the brigade was deployed around the Lydda district, with responsibility for <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv</b> and Jaffa. The first incident involving the brigade came on 14 November 1945, when the Jewish National Council called for a 12-hour strike, which resulted in rioting in <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv.</b> By 18:15 the Palestine Police Force was unable to cope and sent for reinforcements from the 8th Parachute Battalion. The complete battalion was deployed and the riot was under control by 21:40 and a curfew imposed {{for the rest of}} the night. Early the following day the curfew was broken by large crowds gathering to loot and burn buildings, so the remainder of the brigade was deployed to the city under the codename Operation Bellicose. Night time curfews remained in place until 05:20 on 20 November, when all troops returned to their barracks. All was quiet in the brigade area until the night of 26/27 December, when police stations in Jaffa and <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv,</b> the railway at Lydda and an armoury at <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv</b> were attacked. The brigade again imposed a curfew around <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv.</b> This was followed by cordon and search operations: Pintail on 29 December, Heron on 8 January, and Pigeon on 30 January.|$|E

Because of violent conflicts involving the Yishuv, the competition's scheduling was inconsistent and in some seasons no national championship was held.|$|E
