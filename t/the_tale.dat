In the early 1890s, she enjoyed her first professional artistic success when she sold six designs to a greeting card publisher. On 16 December 1901, she privately issued <b>The</b> <b>Tale</b> of Peter Rabbit, and, on 2 October 1902, a trade edition of <b>the</b> <b>tale</b> was released by Frederick Warne & Co. to great success.

In July 1905, Potter bought Hill Top, a working farm in the Lake District with the profits from her books and a small legacy left her by an aunt; the farm became her home away from London and her artistic retreat.
