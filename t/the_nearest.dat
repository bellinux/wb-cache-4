40|$|Spasm of <b>the</b> <b>near</b> reflex {{is a rare}} {{disorder}} that involves intermittent and variable episodes of esotropia, pseudomyopia, and pupillary myosis. It is usually functional in origin and is seen mainly in young patients. Treatment options for spasm of <b>the</b> <b>near</b> reflex have had variable success. In instances where the etiology of spasm of <b>the</b> <b>near</b> reflex was suspected to be hysteria, psychotherapy has proven beneficial. We report {{the case of an}} 11 -year-old girl who had functional spasm of <b>the</b> <b>near</b> reflex. <b>The</b> symptoms persisted for two years.

40|$|Toward the Kerr/CFT {{correspondence}} for generic non-extremal Kerr black hole, {{the analysis}} of scattering amplitudes by near extremal Kerr provides a clue.

For extremal case, <b>the</b> <b>near</b> region {{is expected to be}} <b>the</b> <b>near</b> horizon region in which the correspondence via the asymptotic symmetry is studied. We investigate the hidden conformal symmetry in <b>the</b> <b>near</b> horizon limit and consider the relation between the hidden conformal symmetry and the asymptotic symmetry in <b>the</b> <b>near</b> horizon limit. By using an appropriate definition of the quasi-local charge, we obtain the deviation of the entropy from the extremality. Comment: 23 page...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{escalation}} in interest in developing methods to control <b>the</b> <b>near</b> field because of its role in subwavelength optics.

However, <b>the</b> <b>near</b> field generated in plasmonic metamaterials is fundamentally restricted by their predesigned structure, and super-resolution optical techniques do not directly control <b>the</b> <b>near</b> field. Here, we achieve direct control of <b>the</b> optical <b>near</b> field by shaping the wavefront impinging on turbid media consisting of random nanoparticles. The linear relation between input far field and scattered output near fields allows us to coherently control <b>the</b> <b>near</b> field at arbi-trary positions. Direct control of <b>the</b> <b>near</b> field through scatter-ing control offers novel approaches for subwavelength optics and may have direct applications in bio- and nanophotonics...|$|R
