5|$|Trondheim {{is later}} {{attacked}} by a Norwegian pirate whaler named Olafsson, who has not aged despite being on the ship for <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> <b>days.</b> Mulder, Scully, and Trondheim eventually begin to age unnaturally. Scully develops a theory that the Ardent is sailing near a metallic object beneath the ocean, {{and that it has}} caused free radicals to rapidly oxidize their bodies and age them. When Mulder notices that the ship's sewage pipe is the only one not corroded through, the agents realize that something from the ocean contaminated the Ardents potable water and led to the aging; Olafsson's men remained unaffected due to their consumption of recycled water from the sewage system. Desperate to survive, Trondheim kills Olafsson after he reveals the secret, and sets out to keep the water for himself.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) mind flashes back {{to being}} in the attic with his sister Samantha while their parents are arguing downstairs. Back in the present, Mulder awakens {{in a hotel room}} in Providence, Rhode Island, covered in blood. Mulder calls Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who arrives, finding him in shock. Mulder has a {{pounding}} headache and has no memory of what he has done in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> <b>days.</b> Scully finds that two bullets have been fired from Mulder's gun and that he has keys belonging to a David and Amy Cassandra. Scully wants Mulder to check into a hospital, but he wants to find out if he was involved in a crime before doing so. The agents arrive at the Cassandra's house where the housekeeper tells them they are not at home. Mulder recognizes a house in many of Cassandra's paintings: a house that is near his parent's summer home in Rhode Island. When they arrive there, Mulder has striking pains in his head and flashes back again to when he was a child, seeing a younger version of The Smoking Man (Chris Owens) in his home. The agents enter the home, where they find the Cassandras dead from gunshot wounds.|$|E
500|$|Some protesters {{moved from}} Tahrir Square {{to the area}} outside the {{parliament}} buildings, while demanding the assembly's immediate dissolution. The demonstrators put up a sign that said: [...] "Closed until {{the fall of the}} regime". Cabinet offices in Cairo were evacuated after anti-government protesters gathered outside the building. Meanwhile, labour unions across the country, and particularly in Alexandria, Cairo and Suez, staged general strikes, demanding higher wages and better treatment. The strikers were said to number around 20,000 workers. Violent clashes were reported in Wadi al-Jadid, where police stations and the NDP party building were destroyed, and several deaths and hundreds of injuries also occurred. Protesters in Port Said burnt down the governor's office in response to his reluctance to provide enough housing for the city's residents. Clashes were said to have killed three people and wounded hundreds more in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E

On June 19, local elections took place, and Solidarity urged voters to boycott them. On July 26, government spokesman Jerzy Urban said that Solidarity permanently belonged to <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> and <b>two</b> <b>days</b> later, Polish sociologists announced that only 28% of Poles believed that government’s reforms would succeed. Most people thought that the reforms would end up with even deeper crisis. The first strike of summer 1988 took place in the Upper Silesian city of Jastrzębie-Zdrój, and it began on August 15.|$|R
40|$|Over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> 20 years {{public health}} {{expenditure}} has progressively increased for various reasons. With {{the aim of}} reducing public health expenditure and hospital stays, alternative models of public health care have been more widely adopted over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> decades: <b>Day</b> Hospital, day surgery and ambulatory surgery. What is meant by ambulatory surgery is the clinical, organisational and administrative possibility of performing surgical operations and/or invasive and semi-invasive diagnostic procedures without hospitalisation of patients, in doctors' surgeries, outpatient departments or protected outpatient facilities. For both the patients and the centres providing the service {{to be able to}} exploit all the advantages stemming from this kind of health care provision, careful patient selection is mandatory, including assessment of the impact of any potential concomitant pathologies. Starting from their own personal experience and existing reports in the international literature, the authors analyse the impact that concomitant pathologies may have on patient selection for ambulatory surgery. The authors conclude that thorough preoperative evaluation of all the possible variables involved is the only way of ensuring the success of ambulatory surgery...|$|R
2500|$|Richard Galpin of the BBC, who {{had spent}} <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> {{travelling}} from Poti to Tbilisi, reported that Georgian forces [...] "seemed to be surrendering control of the highway to the Russians". According to BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse, there was a [...] "much-reduced" [...] Russian military presence in Gori that day and humanitarian aid was being delivered, however Russians still controlled major entry and exit points of Gori. The Russian commander claimed that his troops remained in Gori to avoid looting and would only leave after the Georgian police was ready. Major General Vyacheslav Borisov claimed that day to have ordered Russian peacekeepers to replace Russian soldiers in Igoeti, but this was disputed by Georgia. The Times reported that Russia was occupying {{about a third of}} Georgia and that Ossetian militiamen were wearing white armbands to ease their recognition for Russians.|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{investigators}} {{had in the}} past cracked some of the most publicized and difficult cases in Texas, Captain Gonzaullas said that the murders were among the most puzzling cases he had encountered in his 30 years of criminal investigation. He also stated that [...] "We have certain information which we cannot disclose and we do not think the public should expect us to give out any information which would be injurious to our investigation." [...] The Texarkana Gazette and Daily News cooperated with Gonzaullas by withholding such sensitive information. Sheriff Presley and the Rangers stated that, out of the many suspects questioned during <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> and nights of ceaseless work, very little valuable information had been obtained. Presley stated, [...] "We are required to follow all leads, regardless of how thin they might be, in the hope that they will lead to something tangible in the eventual solution of the mystery." [...] The officers started to work in relays on Tuesday after many of them had become exhausted in their investigations. Gonzaullas stated that they were dealing with a shrewd criminal who had left no stones unturned in concealing his identity and activities. A voluntary midnight curfew was agreed upon Tuesday night by the Texarkana, Texas city council and the Bowie county commissioners court for all places of amusement.|$|E
2500|$|Bill {{returns to}} the country mansion in his own car and is met at the gate by {{a man with a}} note warning him to cease and desist his inquiries. After reading a {{newspaper}} story about a beauty queen who died of a drug overdose, Bill views the body at the morgue and identifies it as Mandy. [...] Bill is summoned to Ziegler's house, where he is confronted with {{the events of the past}} night and day. Ziegler was one of those involved with the ritual orgy, and identified Bill and his connection with Nick. Ziegler claims that he had Bill followed for his own protection, and that the warnings made against Bill by the society are only intended to scare him from speaking about the orgy. However, he implies the society is capable of acting on their threats. Bill asks about the death of Mandy, whom Ziegler has identified as the masked woman at the party who'd [...] "sacrificed" [...] herself to prevent Bill's punishment, and about the disappearance of Nick, the piano player. Ziegler insists that Nick is safely back at his home in Seattle. Ziegler also says the [...] "punishment" [...] was a charade by the secret society to further frighten Bill, and it had nothing to do with Mandy's death; she was a hooker and addict and had died from another accidental drug overdose. Bill does not know if Ziegler is telling him the truth about Nick's disappearance or Mandy's death, but he says nothing further. When he returns home, Bill finds the rented mask on his pillow next to his sleeping wife. He breaks down in tears and decides to tell Alice the whole truth of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> <b>days.</b> The next morning, they go Christmas shopping with their daughter. Alice muses that they should be grateful that they have survived, that she loves him and there is something they must do as soon as possible. When Bill asks what it is, she replies, [...] "Fuck".|$|E

The lad was a fine specimen of the young Uitlander. A life passed largely in the open air, hard work and exercise, had broadened his shoulders and made him look at least a year older than he really was. He was a splendid rider and an excellent shot with his rifle, for his father had obtained a permit from the authorities for him to carry one, and he could bring down an antelope when running at full speed as neatly as any of the young Boers. Four days a week he had spent in the mines, for his father intended him to follow in his footsteps, and he had worked by turns with the miners below and the engineers on the surface, so that he might in the course of a few years be thoroughly acquainted with all the details of his profession.|$|R

During the initial physical examination the dog was tachypneic and dyspneic with harsh lung sounds. His peripheral lymph nodes were normal is both size and consistency. Neither cardiac murmurs nor arrhythmias were detected. All other physical examination parameters were within normal limits. The top differential diagnoses included relapse-lymphoma, heart disease, primary lung disease, and coagulopathy. Blood work from the referring veterinarian, 3 days earlier, revealed a normochromic normocytic non-regenerative anemia and a slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase of 256 U/L (reference range: 23 - 212).

30|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} two periods that {{experienced}} {{dramatic changes in}} the rules and regulations governing movement between the US and Mexico. The rules concern the documentation that US residents need to produce in order to reenter the US from Mexico. We seek to establish whether these changes in regulations are important in explaining the reduction, over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> decades, in <b>day</b> trips from the US into Mexico (and back). This reduction in day trips stands in marked contrast to the increasing volumes of goods and services trade, as well as tourism that is not associated with the border. We begin (in Sect.  2) with a very short discussion {{of the importance of the}} border region to the Mexican economy, and the role that short visits may play in the border region’s economic and social development. We then provide (in Sect.  3) a provisional outline of the two changes to the border crossing regulatory regime that have been of considerable consequence for recorded cross-border day trips. We also briefly discuss a critical confounding factor, namely the dramatic increase in the homicide rate within the Mexican border states. Sections  4 and 5 present estimates of the impact of the two regulatory regime changes on day trips. The conclusion summarizes the implications of our analysis for the growth and transformation of the border economy and the tourism sector.|$|R
