40|$|Purpose: The {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the incidence of adverse reactions to antimalarial drugs among residents of a Nigeria university community {{with a focus on}} artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). Specifically, the profile of use, and the reporting culture of people with respect to experienced reactions were noted. Method: Questionnaires were administered to respondents at the university health centre between November 2006 and January 2007. Information on demographic characteristics, nature of experienced adverse reactions and the most frequently used ACT, among other questions, were collected. Descriptive statistics and Fisher’s Exact test were used to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondent’s</b> opinion. Result: <b>The</b> study achieved a response rate of 86 %. The results revealed that 210 (70. 0 %) <b>of</b> <b>respondents</b> said they had used artemisinin-based combination drugs while 134 (44. 7 %) said they used artemisinin derivatives alone as monotherapy for malaria treatment. Artesunate plus amodiaquine 94 (31. 3 %) as a co-packaged product was the most commonly used ACT. Incidence of the experienced adverse reactions to ACT was reported to be generally mild and well tolerated.

Demography is the statistical study of populations, especially human beings.

Demography encompasses the study of the size, structure, and <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> these populations, and spatial or temporal changes in them in response to birth, migration, ageing, and death. Demographics are quantifiable characteristics of a given population. Demographic analysis can cover whole societies or groups defined by criteria such as education, nationality, religion, and ethnicity. Educational institutions usually treat demography as a field of sociology, though {{there are a number of}} independent demography departments. In the Information and Communication Technology age, it is practically impossible for an aerospace scientist or engineer to carry out his research work without embracing the network and Internet technologies. They greatly depend upon these electronic innovation tools for accessing electronic information resources in the form of e-journals related to aerospace engineering right at the desktops. Now, it is absolutely clear that use of electronic media to support scientific communication has undoubtedly been one of the paradigm shifts in the practice of science in this era.

Qualitative and quantitative methodologies were used to elicit information from respondents who were adult males and females of 18 years and above. The research instruments were questionnaires and in-depth interview schedule. Questionnaires were administered on 1000 respondents while 13 people were interviewed in-depth. Analysis of quantitative data were conducted by using the Statistical package for Social Sciences. Univariate analysis in the form of frequencies were conducted which generated <b>the</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondents</b> across the research variables. Furthermore, multivariate analysis were conducted to test the hypotheses and sought for relationships among variables. The qualitative data were reported in themes based on the research objectives and were analysed jointly with the quantitative data. The findings were that majority of the respondents viewed HIV/AIDS as a disease that afflict immoral people and as a punishment from God. Only a handful of them saw the disease as a disease that could afflict anybody. Also, many of the respondents said that AIDS is real but showed...|$|E

Finish line is to point to physical activity as an important risk factor for pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Trated 80 patients in the endocrine clinic, Clinical Hospital Centre in Gracanica-in Lapje vilage. Respondents processed curriculum guide from the National Programme for the Prevention of type 2 diabetes, the Republic of Serbia. Respondents were performed anthropometric measurements: body weight, height, BMI. They are also used for laboratory test-glucose, OGTT. All data were analyzed statistically relevant tests. Of 80 patients, 33 (41. 25 %) were male and 47 (58. 75 %) were females. No statistical significance Hi 2 test <b>the</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondents</b> by familial history (= 0. 007, p> 0. 05). Physical inactivity is registered in 16 patients (20 %), while the other 64 patients are physically active. Normal fasting glucose in physically inactive respondents was 56. 25 % (9), and glucose greater than 7 mmol / l had 18. 75 % of the respondents. Positive OGTT findings in physically inactive subjects was confirmed in 62. 5 %, a positive OGTT findings in physically active is registered in only 5 patients (11. 36 %). Those with risk of type 2 diabetes (score 12 or more) of 60 % were physically inactive. Moderate physical activity can significantly 'postpone' development of diabetes mellitus type 2, especially correcting weight...|$|E

The data {{used in this study}} is primary data obtained from <b>the</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> questionnaires. <b>Respondents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study were 130 BCA bank customers in Surabaya self that have become customer for 2 years and have a high school education with the last non-probability sampling technique of sampling. Data processing method used is multiple linear regression models, the F test and t-test values with the windows program SPSS 16. 0. 	From the results of the data processing and hypothesis testing can be concluded that there are 4 variables that have significant impact on customer loyalty variables that trust, commitment, communications and conflict handling. The value of the affect trust on customer loyalty is 0, 232, the affect of commitment on customer loyalty is 0, 171, value for communications variables affect on customer loyalty is 0, 291, and last value for conflict handling variables affect on customer loyalty is 0, 264. Based on the coefficient of determination of the amount of variation in the variables trust, commitment, communications, conflict handling is jointly able to explain the variation in the variables of customer loyalty at 73, 3...|$|R

Regrettably however, this enterprise has remained largely rudimentary and undeveloped. Thus, the output 0 / oil palm products {{has been on the}} decline over the years. This study empirically analyzed the projitability a/palm oil processing and investigated its potentials for poverty alleviation and rural transformation in Ondo state. Primary data were collected using a set of structured questionnaire from 260 respondents who were selected through multistage samplingfrom 3 Local Government Areas of On do State. From each ofthe selected I,GAs, 13 villages were randomly selected and 4 palm oil processors were also randomly selected from each ofthe selected villages, thus, making a sample size 0.

A relative unevenness in <b>the</b> income <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondents</b> as confirmed by Gini coefficients value of 0. 59.

40|$|Cell {{suppression}} {{has been}} a commonly used method at the Census Bureau and at other agencies for protecting sensitive cells in statistical tables whose cells contain magnitude data. In this method, the sensitivity of each cell depends on <b>the</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>respondent</b> values which are summed to form the cell value. Those cells determined to be sensitive are suppressed and then a cell suppression program is run to determine which additional cells (called secondary suppressions) need to be suppressed {{in order to protect}} the sensitive ones. In this study, we compare two ways of protecting sensitive cells and their effects on the suppression patterns, i. e., the set of secondary ones. These ways are (1) fixed interval protection and (2) sliding protection. In studies done over a decade ago by researchers at the University of Maryland, it was shown that sliding protection often leads to fewer secondary suppressions than fixed interval protection. Here we show that this result does not hold when the cell suppression program incorporates the following assumption: if v is any respondent value, then any table user knows, from publicly available information, that the value lies in the interval [0, 2 *v]. In other words, respondent values are known by interested parties to within 100 % of their actual value...|$|R
