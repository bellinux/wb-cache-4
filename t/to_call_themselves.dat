5|$|During Hamilton's {{tenure as}} Treasury Secretary, {{political}} factions began to emerge. A Congressional caucus, led by James Madison and William Branch Giles, {{began as an}} opposition group to Hamilton's financial programs, and Thomas Jefferson joined this group {{when he returned from}} France. Hamilton and his allies began <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>themselves</b> Federalists. The opposition group, now called the Democratic-Republican Party by political scientists, was at the time known as Republicans.|$|E
5|$|Discontent {{crystallised}} into {{a wave of}} uprisings and rioting {{known as}} the Small Revolution (Kleine Revolutie) of 1787. The revolution was suppressed by levying the civil militias but it alarmed the Governors-General and opposition grew. The Small Revolution proved that the Austrian army was insufficient on its own to keep order without some popular support. The allegiance of the civil militias, who were already beginning <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>themselves</b> Patriots (Patriotten), was uncertain. Fearing {{for the security of}} the regime, the Governors-General temporarily suspended the reforms without the Emperor's permission on 20 May 1787. They invited all aggrieved parties to express their opposition and grievances in petitions but this merely inflamed the regime's critics. The Emperor himself was furious and recalled his minister, Ludovico, Count di Belgiojoso. Alarmed by the level of unrest, Joseph eventually agreed to repeal his reforms to the judicial system and governance but left his clerical reforms in place. He hoped that, by removing the grievances of the states and middle classes, the opposition would become divided and would be easily suppressed. He also appointed a new Minister Plenipotentiary to oversee the province. The concession did not stop the opposition growing, inspired and funded by the Catholic clergy, which became especially notable at the University of Leuven.|$|E
5|$|The Mikea are hunter-gatherers (also called foragers) who {{practice}} limited farming. The Mikea label {{is applied to}} those who live this subsistence lifestyle rather than being tied to a specific ethnicity. There are numerous groups termed Mikea along the west and southwest coast of Madagascar, with the majority living {{in and around the}} spiny Mikea Forest on the southwestern coast between Morombe and Toliara, an area extending 2500 square kilometers. Historically this main concentration of Mikea may have extended as far south as the Fiherenana River and as far north as the Mangoky River; another main cluster of Mikea live to the west and southwest of Lake Ihotry. They are typically considered a subset of the Sakalava ethnic group, although there are Mikea individuals who trace their origins to other ethnic groups. Their adherence to a way of life perceived by villagers and city dwellers as ancestral has contributed to a mystique and various myths and legends about them, and many Malagasy believe they are the descendents of Vazimba, the original inhabitants of the island, although {{there is no evidence to}} support this view. The majority of Malagasy believe the existence of the Mikea to be a myth and are unaware that any Malagasy continue to live the Mikea lifestyle to the present day. The term Mikea is principally used by outsiders to label this group and is not often used by members of this community themselves. Most Mikea prefer <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>themselves</b> either Vezo-Mikea or Masikoro-Mikea, depending on their specific family lineages.|$|E

5000|$|During {{and after}} the third council, {{elements}} of the Sthavira group <b>called</b> <b>themselves</b> Vibhajjavādins. One part of this group was transmitted to Sri Lanka and to certain areas of southern India, such as Vanavasi in the south-west and the Kañci region in the south-east. This group later ceased to refer to themselves specifically as [...] "Vibhajjavādins", but reverted <b>to</b> <b>calling</b> <b>themselves</b> [...] "Theriyas", after the earlier Theras (Sthaviras). Still later, at some point prior to the Dipavamsa (4th century), the Pali name Theravāda was adopted and has remained in use ever since for this group.|$|R
25|$|After the {{war with}} Japan began, large numbers of {{experienced}} AIF officers were posted to Militia units. As a consequence, units {{in which more than}} 75% of their personnel were AIF volunteers were permitted <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>themselves</b> AIF units. By November 1944, 20 of the Militia's 33 infantry battalions were entitled <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>themselves</b> AIF. At this time the Army was 423,000 strong, of whom 25,000 were women, and 307,000 were members of the AIF.|$|E

25|$|This {{cultural}} {{revival of}} the Interbellum years served to give the Livonian people {{for the first time}} a clear consciousness of their ethnic identity. Before, they had always referred to themselves as rāndalist ("coast dwellers") or kalāmīed ("fishermen"). From the 1920s and 1930s on, though, they began <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>themselves</b> līvõd, līvnikad, or līvlist ("Livonians").|$|E
25|$|After the Separation the Avari became divided {{even more}} than the Eldar, though little of their history became known to the Elves and Men of the West of Middle-earth. At least six kindreds existed, and they {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>themselves</b> 'Quendi', considering those who went away as deserters. Some of these tribes later also journeyed westward, intermingling with the Nandor, and a few even reached Beleriand, though usually remaining in unfriendly relationship with the Sindar.|$|E

50|$|As the Japanese entered Burma, many Burmese volunteers {{joined the}} BIA. By {{the time the}} Japanese forces reached Rangoon on 8 March, the BIA {{numbered}} 12,000, and eventually expanded to 18,000. Many of the volunteers who joined the BIA were not officially recruited, but rather individuals or gangs who took <b>to</b> <b>calling</b> <b>themselves</b> BIA <b>to</b> further their own activities. The Japanese provided few weapons to the BIA, but they armed themselves from abandoned or captured British weapons.|$|R
25|$|It is now {{believed}} that the club was originally a Thursday Club in the literal sense {{but that it was}} understood from the beginning that it considered itself to be representative of Middlesex as a county. It may even have had a Middlesex birth qualification for membership, like Yorkshire CCC so famously had until recently. Very soon, they decided <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>themselves</b> the Middlesex county team and so we have here a parallel with Hambledon Club/Hampshire.|$|E
25|$|On 17 June, the Third Estate, {{led by the}} comte de Mirabeau, began <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>themselves</b> the National Assembly. On {{the morning}} of 20 June, the deputies were shocked to {{discover}} that the chamber door was locked and guarded by soldiers. Immediately fearing the worst and anxious that a royal attack by King Louis XVI was imminent, the deputies congregated in a nearby indoor Jeu de paume court in the Saint-Louis district of the city of Versailles, near the Palace of Versailles.|$|E
25|$|In KwaZulu-Natal, Coloureds {{possess a}} diverse {{heritage}} including British, Irish, German, Mauritian, Saint Helenian, Indian, Xhosa and Zulu. Zimbabwean Coloureds are descended from Shona or Ndebele and British and Afrikaner settlers. Griqua, {{on the other}} hand, are descendants of Khoisan women and Afrikaner Trekboers. Despite these major differences, their ancestry {{from more than one}} naturalised racial group means that they are coloured in the South African context. Such mixed-race people did not necessarily self-identify this way; some preferred <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>themselves</b> black or Khoisan or just South African.|$|E

For the Brusseleers, many simply consider themselves as belonging to Brussels. For the many rather recent immigrants from other countries, the identification also includes all the national origins: people tend <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>themselves</b> Moroccans or Turks rather than an American-style hyphenated version.|$|E
25|$|Around 1848 a {{group of}} volunteers from the Mexican–American War were {{eventually}} discharged and settled in San Francisco. Many of them were from New York City gangs from the Five Points and Bowery districts. About sixty of them organized into a gang called the Hounds, paraded around {{as if they were}} military, and even creating a headquarters named Tammany Hall within a tent on Kearney Street. In 1849, these thugs began <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>themselves</b> the Regulators as they harassed Mexicans and those of Spanish origin, and extorted money from local businesses for protection services. Anyone who would not pay was likely to lose a nose, ear, or suffer greater bodily injury. However, after {{a group of}} 230 men organized into a militia and confronted the Hounds with possible arrest, they quickly fled from San Francisco.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, {{there are}} many new age {{travellers}} who are known as hippies to outsiders, but prefer <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>themselves</b> the Peace Convoy. They started the Stonehenge Free Festival in 1974, but English Heritage later banned the festival in 1985, resulting in the Battle of the Beanfield. With Stonehenge banned as a festival site, new age travellers gather at the annual Glastonbury Festival. Today, hippies in the UK {{can be found in}} parts of South West England, such as Bristol (particularly the neighborhoods of Montpelier, Stokes Croft, St Werburghs, Bishopston, Easton and Totterdown), Glastonbury in Somerset, Totnes in Devon, and Stroud in Gloucestershire, as well as in Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire, and in areas of London and Brighton. In the summer, many hippies and those of similar subcultures gather at numerous outdoor festivals in the countryside.|$|E

In addition, the early drum majors were chosen in physical combat; insomuch that the candidates were placed in a locked room, with the best fighter / the one emerging victorious, being named to the coveted position.

25|$|British Americans have Cornish, English, Scottish, Ulster Scots, and/or Welsh family heritages, or {{came from}} Canada where their {{ancestors}} were of British descent, and are those Americans who were British born. Catholic Irish-Americans {{are not usually}} categorized as having British ancestry; they do not usually consider themselves as being British Americans. Immigrants from Canada of British ancestry tend <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>themselves</b> Canadian Americans. Similarly, most British Americans tend to differentiate to being specifically Cornish, English, Northern Irish, Irish, Scottish, Welsh or ethnic minorities (e.g. Pakistani Scottish) and do not identify with the UK as a whole, therefore tending not to refer to themselves as British American (see: Cornish American, English American, Scottish American, Welsh American, or Scots-Irish American) and settlers of British heritage from other former British territories like Australia, New Zealand and South Africa also consider themselves by their nationalities, Australian Americans, New Zealand Americans and South African-Americans.|$|E

25|$|The temperance {{movement}} {{was born in}} Ohio and New York State in 1873 when local women, concerned about alcohol's influence on home life, met in churches for prayer and then embarked on visits to saloons to confront those they felt responsible. During {{the next couple of}} years, the movement caught fire, with women demanding that saloons cease selling alcohol. The women of Fredonia, New York were the first credited with visiting local saloons under the aegis of their leader Mrs. Esther McNeil and, on December 22, 1873 were the first <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>themselves</b> the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Two days later, following a lecture at the Hillsboro, Ohio Music Hall the night before, the Crusade was born when Mrs. Eliza Thompson, a judge's wife and the daughter of a former governor, gathered 70 women in prayer at the Presbyterian Church and marched to the local saloons. Singing hymns as they went, the women demanded the saloons cease selling alcohol.|$|E
