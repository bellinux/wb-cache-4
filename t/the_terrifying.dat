5|$|The Kurma Purana narrates {{that during}} a {{particular}} council of rishis (sages), the god Brahma arrogantly {{declared that he}} was the Supreme Creator of the Universe. Shiva appeared at the assembly as an infinite pillar of light and challenged Brahma's statement. After deliberation, the council accepted Shiva as the true Creator, but Brahma remained obstinate. Angered by Brahma's vanity, Shiva—as <b>the</b> <b>terrifying</b> Bhairava—cut off one head of the five-headed Brahma with a mere flick of his fingernail (an act iconographically depicted as Brahmashirascheda-murti). As a consequence Brahma died, but the spiritual credit he had accumulated over a lifetime of devout asceticism pulled him immediately back from death. Upon his resurrection, Brahma accepted Shiva's superiority. The reason for the decapitation of Brahma remains the same in the narratives of the Shiva Purana and the Matsya Purana. In the Skanda Purana, the trigger is not Brahma's arrogance but his incest with his daughter, while in the Bengali version of the Shiva Purana, Brahma insults Shiva using his fifth head's mouth, while the rest of them praise Shiva when he comes to Brahma's abode as a guest. In another instance in the Shiva Purana, when an argument erupts between Brahma and Vishnu over who is superior, Shiva appears as an infinite fiery pillar (Linga) in front of the pair. They decide whoever finds the end of the pillar is superior. Brahma lies about finding the head of the infinite pillar and declares himself as superior. In the Varaha Purana, in which Shiva is born from Brahma's brow, Brahma calls his son a Kapali and angers him. In all versions, an infuriated Shiva or Bhairava cuts off Brahma's head as a punishment. However, all Puranas (Kurma, Varaha, Shiva, Skanda, and Vamana) agree that the head of Brahma stuck to Bhairava-Shiva's left palm due to the sin of killing Brahma, the most learned Brahmin – Brahmahatya or Brahminicide. To expiate the sin of brahmahatya, Shiva had to perform the vow of a Kapali: wandering the world as a naked beggar with the skull of the slain as his begging bowl. In the Kurma and Vamana Puranas, Shiva's sin takes corporeal form, becoming a ghoulish woman called Brahmahatya who follows Bhikshatana everywhere he goes.|$|E

25|$|In R v Charlton (2003) EWCA Crim 415, {{following}} {{threats of}} sexual and violent abuse against {{herself and her}} daughter, the defendant killed her obsessive, jealous, controlling partner while he was restrained by handcuffs, blindfolded and gagged {{as part of their}} regular sexual activity. The term of five years' imprisonment was reduced to {{three and a half years}} because of <b>the</b> <b>terrifying</b> threats made by a man determined to dominate and control the defendant's life. The threats created a genuine fear for the safety of herself and more significantly, her daughter, and this caused the defendant to lose control and make the ferocious attack.|$|E

25|$|The Black Death which devastated Europe in the 14th century {{also gave}} rise to {{widespread}} persecution. In the face of <b>the</b> <b>terrifying</b> spread of the plague, the Jews served as scapegoats and were accused of poisoning the wells. As a result, many Jewish communities in western and central Europe were destroyed {{in a wave of}} violence between 1348 and 1350. For example, some two thousand Jews were massacred by burning in Strasbourg, in February 1349, upon a decision by the city council, before the plague had reached the city. In the German states a total of approximately 300 Jewish communities were destroyed during this period, because of Jews being killed or driven out.|$|E
25|$|In {{the diverse}} traditions within Hinduism, both the {{clockwise}} and counter-clockwise swastika are found, with different meaning. The clockwise or right hand icon is called swastika, while the counter clockwise or left hand is called sauvastika. The clockwise swastika is a solar symbol (Surya), mirroring {{the motion of}} Sun in India (the northern hemisphere) where it appears to enter from east, then south, exiting to the west. The counterclockwise sauvastika is less used, connotes the night and in tantric traditions it is an icon for goddess Kali, <b>the</b> <b>terrifying</b> form of Devi Durga. The symbol also reminds and symbolizes activity, karma, motion, wheel, lotus in some contexts. Its symbolism for motion and sun may be from shared prehistoric cultural roots, according to Norman McClelland.|$|E
25|$|Another of Beyond the Black Rainbows main themes is identity. Over {{the course}} of the movie Dr. Nyle {{experiences}} a radical change of personality whose roots lie in <b>the</b> <b>terrifying</b> drug experience he had in 1966, under Mercurio Arboria's supervision. Being exposed to his shadow side so intensely crippled not only his mind, but his body: Barry is forced to use appliances such as a wig and contact lenses. Similar to many a Lovecraftian protagonist, Barry Nyle is ultimately a pathetic character: his far-reaching knowledge, restrained demeanor and carefully controlled work environment are unable to dominate the forces of irrationality and chaos burning in his mind. In the end, the doctor undergoes a physical and psychological transformation where he forfeits all control and gives in to madness.|$|E

25|$|While Gude was a student, two {{different}} trends in landscaping were developing at the Academy: a romantic trend and a classical trend. The romanticists depicted wild, untamed wildernesses with dark forests, soaring peaks, and rushing water to capture <b>the</b> <b>terrifying</b> and overpowering aspects of nature. They used rich, saturated colors with strong {{contrast of light}} and shadow. The classicists {{were more interested in}} recreating landscapes from the heroic or mythical past and often set them in the midst of religious or historical events. The classicists focused on lines and clarity in their compositions. It was through Achenbach — Gude's first teacher upon arriving in Düsseldorf — that he was exposed to the romanticist tradition, while it was through his classes with and later time teaching for Schirmer that he was exposed to the classicist traditions.|$|E
