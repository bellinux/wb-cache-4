40|$|Endothelial tubulogenesis is the {{formation}} of functional blood vessels. The purpose {{of this research is}} to understand how actin drives this process. To observe the function of actin, certain <b>transgenic</b> <b>gene</b> lines will be characterized. These <b>transgenic</b> <b>gene</b> lines are LifeAct, Moesin, Moesin-Actin-Binding Domain, and Alpha-Catenin. These genes will allow us to see how actin contributes to vascular formation. This formation will be visualized using fluorescent proteins RFP and GFP. These proteins will act as markers on each <b>transgenic</b> <b>gene</b> line to monitor the process of endothelial tubulogenesis in zebrafish using confocal microscopy. The zebrafish will express fluorescents in these gene lines using the GAL 4 -UAS system. This system is expressed in the vascular system, and binds to the UAS sequence to activate fluorescents for the gene of interest. Based on our research, actin acts as structural units to form vasculature. Actin is a functional protein that forms microfilaments {{that can be used in}} this process. This is based on where actin was expressed in zebrafish during endothelial tubulogenesis. Actin was expressed from major vessels, and expressed more in areas with continual vasculature formation. This shows that actin is an important factor in endothelial tubulogenesis...|$|E

40|$|The forelimbs and hindlimbs of {{vertebrates}} are morphologically distinct. Pitx 1, {{expressed in}} the hindlimb bud mesenchyme, {{is required for the}} formation of hindlimb characteristics and produces hindlimb-like morphologies when misexpressed in forelimbs. Pitx 1 is also necessary for normal expression of Tbx 4, a transcription factor required for normal hindlimb development. Despite the importance of this protein in these processes, little is known about its mechanism of action. Using a <b>transgenic</b> <b>gene</b> replacement strategy in a Pitx 1 mutant mouse, we have uncoupled two discrete functions of Pitx 1. We show that, firstly, this protein influences hindlimb outgrowth by regulating Tbx 4 expression levels and that, subsequently, it shapes hindlimb bone and soft tissue morphology independently of Tbx 4. We provide the first description of how Pitx 1 sculpts the forming hindlimb skeleton by localised modulation of the growth rate of discrete elements...|$|E

In addition, the level of expression of the <b>transgenic</b> <b>gene</b> was substantially higher that that of the endogenous gene.

40|$|AbstractMouse genetic {{manipulation}} has provided an excellent system to characterize gene function in numerous contexts. A number of mutants {{have been produced}} by using <b>transgenic,</b> <b>gene</b> knockout, and mutagenesis techniques. Nevertheless, one limitation {{is that it is}} difficult to express a gene in vivo in a restricted manner (i. e., spatially and temporally), because the number of available enhancers and promoters which can confine gene expression is limited. We have developed a novel method to introduce DNA into in/exo utero embryonic mouse brains at various stages by using electroporation. More than 90 % of operated embryos survived, and more than 65 % of these expressed the introduced genes in restricted regions of the brain. Expression was maintained even after birth, 6 weeks after electroporation. The use of fluorescent protein genes clearly visualized neuronal morphologies in the brain. Moreover, it was possible to transfect three different DNA vectors into the same cells. Thus, this method will be a powerful tool to characterize gene function in various settings due to its high efficiency and localized gene expression...|$|E

40|$|Information on the {{potential}} of pollen mediated gene flow (PMGF) in sorghum is required for ensuring varietal purity and to mitigate risk <b>transgenic</b> <b>gene</b> flow. Replicated trials were conducted in Kenya using a local landrace, ‘Ochuti’ as pollen donor surrounded by male-sterile pollen baits. Frequency of PMGF decreased {{with the increase of}} distance from pollen sources and was significantly influenced by wind direction and speed. Anther dehiscence correlated with increase in vapour pressure deficit in the morning. A negative exponential regression model with logarithmic transformation of PMGF and square-root transformation of distance from source field best fitted the data. Up to 50 % of female florets on a male sterile (MS) plant were pollinated at 1 m from pollen source and declined to 14 % at 10 m. The maximum distance of PMGF using the PMGF model, based on a threshold of one seed per MS plant, was 203 m when data above the 95 th percentile is considered. However, in the presence of self-produced pollen of male-fertile target plants, the possibility of long-distance cross-pollination may be very low.

In the pathogenesis of liver disease and metabolic disorders in HCV infection, oxidative stress due to mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction plays a pivotal role. Tacrolimus (FK 506) is supposed to protect mitochondrial respiratory function. We studied whether tacrolimus affects the development of HCV-associated liver disease using HCV core <b>gene</b> <b>transgenic</b> mice, which develop hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Administration of tacrolimus to HCV core <b>gene</b> <b>transgenic</b> mice three times per week for 3 months led to {{a significant reduction in}} the amounts of lipid in the liver as well as in serum insulin.

40|$|The sodium leak channel NARROW ABDOMEN (NA) / NALCN is an {{important}} component of circadian pacemaker neuronal output. In Drosophila, rhythmic expression of the NA channel regulator Nlf- 1 in a subset of adult pacemaker neurons has been proposed to contribute to circadian regulation of channel localization or activity. Here we have restricted expression of Drosophila NA channel subunits or the Nlf- 1 regulator to either development or adulthood using the temperature-inducible tubulin-GAL 80 ts system. Surprisingly, we find that developmental expression of endogenous channel subunits and Nlf- 1 is sufficient to promote robust rhythmic behavior in adults. Moreover, we find that channel complex proteins produced during development persist in the Drosophila head with little decay for at least 5 – 7 days in adults. In contrast, restricting either endogenous or <b>transgenic</b> <b>gene</b> expression to adult stages produces only limited amounts of the functional channel complex. These data indicate that much of the NA channel complex that functions in adult circadian neurons is normally produced during development, and that the channel complex is very stable in most neurons in the Drosophila brain. Based on these findings, we propose that circadian regulation of NA channel function in adult pacemaker neurons is mediated primarily by post-translational mechanisms that are independent of Nlf- 1...|$|E
40|$|The plasma {{membrane}} proton pump (H+-ATPase) found in plants and fungi is a P-type ATPase with a polypeptide sequence, structure, and in vivo function {{similar to the}} mammalian sodium pump (Na+, K+-ATPase). Despite its hypothetical importance for generating and maintaining the proton motive force that energizes the carriers and channels that underlie plant nutrition, genetic evidence for such a central function {{has not yet been}} reported. Using a reverse genetic approach for investigating each of the 11 isoforms in the Arabidopsis H+-ATPase (AHA) gene family, we found that one member, AHA 3, is essential for pollen formation. A causative role for AHA 3 in male gametogenesis was proven by complementation with a normal <b>transgenic</b> <b>gene</b> and rescue of the mutant phenotype back to wild type. We also investigated the requirement for phosphorylation of the penultimate threonine, which is found in most members of the AHA family and is thought to be involved in regulating catalytic activity.

In the optimized sequence, we used the preferred codons of B. bassiana to encode all of the given amino acids, which would improve the gene expression level (Elena et al. 2014). The coding sequence of AaIT was synthesized and cloned into pBARGPE 1 (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1 b). The strong gpdA promoter can drive the exogenous gene expression efficiently, which had been extensively and successfully applied for the <b>transgenic</b> <b>gene</b> expression in M. anisopliae and B. bassiana (Lu et al. 2008; St et al. 1996). Furthermore, the AaIT gene was genetically induced into the genome of the wild type B. bassiana to enhance its virulence to mosquitoes, and the mitotically stable transformant Bb-AaIT could successfully express this exogenous toxin. The virulence of Bb-AaIT and the wild type to larval (with infection through conidia ingestion) or adult mosquitoes (infection through cuticle or conidia ingestion) were compared at low, middle and high concentrations by survival analysis. For both Bb-AaIT and the WT, the virulence was increased with the increase in the concentration, and the difference was significant. Bb-AaIT-treated larvae tended to die faster than those treated with the WT at each given concentration; and Bb-AaIT-treated adult mosquitoes only died faster than those treated with the WT at the high concentration.

40|$|During B cell differentiation, {{at least}} three stages can be {{defined in terms of}} their growth signal {{requirement}} by using two different growth signals, which are recombinant interleukin 7 (IL- 7) and a stromal cell clone PA 6 which does not produce IL- 7; first a PA 6 dependent stage, second a PA 6 + IL- 7 dependent stage and third an IL- 7 dependent stage. In order to test the possibility that this differentiation of growth signal requirement is controlled by the expression of functional immunoglobulin molecules, we have investigated the frequencies of PA 6 + IL- 7 dependent and IL- 7 dependent cells which are present in the bone marrow of either mu-chain or kappa-chain <b>gene</b> <b>transgenic</b> mice. In a mu-chain <b>gene</b> <b>transgenic</b> mouse, the frequency of PA 6 + IL- 7 dependent cells is selectively reduced, while that of IL- 7 dependent cells is selectively reduced in a kappa-chain <b>gene</b> <b>transgenic</b> mouse.

40|$|Previous {{animal studies}} {{had shown that}} {{increasing}} heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70) using a <b>transgenic,</b> <b>gene</b> therapy or pharmacological approach provided cardiac protection in models of acute cardiac stress. Furthermore, clinical studies had reported associations between Hsp 70 levels and protection against atrial fibrillation (AF). AF {{is the most common}} cardiac arrhythmia presenting in cardiology clinics and is associated with increased rates of heart failure and stroke. Improved therapies for AF and heart failure are urgently required. Despite promising observations in animal studies which targeted Hsp 70, we recently reported that increasing Hsp 70 was unable to attenuate cardiac dysfunction and pathology in a mouse model which develops heart failure and intermittent AF. Given our somewhat unexpected finding and the extensive literature suggesting Hsp 70 provides cardiac protection, it was considered important to assess whether Hsp 70 could provide protection in another mouse model of heart failure and AF. The aim of the current study was to determine whether increasing Hsp 70 could attenuate adverse cardiac remodeling, cardiac dysfunction and episodes of arrhythmia in a mouse model of heart failure and AF due to overexpression of Muscle-Restricted Coiled-Coil (MURC). Cardiac function and pathology were assessed in mice at approximately 12 months of age. We report here, that chronic overexpression of Hsp 70 was unable to provide protection against cardiac dysfunction, conduction abnormalities, fibrosis or characteristic molecular markers of the failing heart. In summary, elevated Hsp 70 may provide protection in acute cardiac stress settings, but appears insufficient to protect the heart under chronic cardiac disease conditions...|$|E

Extracts were assessed for DNA yield using a fluorescent-based DNA quantification assay and for quality measuring their absorbance ratios at 260 nm / 280 nm and 260 nm / 230 nm. The CTAB-based method yielded the highest quantity and DNA template quality. A difference in the 260 nm / 230 nm absorbance ratio was observed among the different extraction methods.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{founding}} member of the EMAP-like protein family is the Echinoderm Microtubule-Associated Protein (EMAP), so-named for its abundance in sea urchin, starfish, and sand dollar eggs. The EMAP-like protein family has five members in mammals (EML 1 through EML 5) and only one in both Drosophila (ELP- 1) and C. elegans (ELP- 1). Biochemical studies of sea urchin EMAP and vertebrate EMLs implicate these proteins in the regulation of microtubule stability. So far, however, the physiological function of this protein family remains unknown. Results We examined the expression pattern of C. elegans ELP- 1 by means of <b>transgenic</b> <b>gene</b> expression in living embryos and adults, and by immunolocalization with an ELP- 1 -specific antibody in fixed tissues. In embryos, ELP- 1 is expressed in the hypodermis. In larvae and adults, ELP- 1 is expressed in the body wall, spermatheca and vulval muscles, intestine, and hypodermal seam cells. In muscle, ELP- 1 is associated with adhesion complexes near the cell surface and is bound to a criss-crossing network of microtubules in the cytoplasm. ELP- 1 is also expressed in a subset of mechanoreceptor neurons, including the ray neurons in the male tail, microtubule-rich touch receptor neurons, and the six ciliated IL 1 neurons. This restricted localization in the nervous system implies that ELP- 1 plays a role in mechanotransmission. Consistent with this idea, decreasing ELP- 1 expression decreases sensitivity to gentle touch applied to the body wall. Conclusion These data imply that ELP- 1 may play an important role during the transmission of forces and signals between the body surface and both muscle cells and touch receptor neurons. </p...|$|E

The article {{presents the results}} of studies to determine the parameters of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in order to develop a multiplex system for identification of the structural elements of the design of <b>transgenic</b> <b>gene</b> cp  4  epsps, which provides tole­rance to glyphosate. For amplicon target DNA sequences, the following values of temperature conditions of PCR were determined: step 1 (initial denaturation) 95 °C – 3 min; step 2 (specific reaction products accumulation) : denaturation 95 °C – 45 s; hybridization of primers 55 °C – 50 s; elongation 72 °C – 1 min; number of cycles – 40; step 3 (final elongation) 72 °C – 6  min. A series of PCR were carried out for the purpose of selecting the optimal amount of DNA matrix for efficient estimate of transgenic sugar beet plants for the presence of specific sequences. Conclusions. To identify transgenic glyphosate-tolerant sugar beet, it is advisable to determine 35 S promoter and gene cp 4 epsps in individual genotypes. It was found that during the selection of temperature parameters of multiplex reaction a 5  °C rise in primer hybridization temperature did not affect the identification of gene als that allowed to include specific primers for determination of this sequence as an internal control. Based on the results of test multiplex reactions, concentrations of dNTPs and Mg 2 + ions were determined that allowed to exclude the possibility of non-specific fragments and false-negative results. The optimum amount of matrix DNA (100 – 150 ng) for an efficient estimate of transgenic sugar beet plants for the presence of specific sequences was determined. Obtained results allowed to develop a multiplex test system for identification of transgenic glyphosate-to­lerant sugar beet which can be used for simultaneous determination of the 35 S promoter, cp  4  epsps gene and als gene as an internal reaction control...|$|E

First, the reference primers were designed and collected {{were compared to}} detect genes that were transferred in Roundup Ready soybean. The results indicate that designed primers were no false positive. Two pairs of primers, 35 SP-F/R (143 bp) and LEC-F/R (175 bp), were used in multiplex PCR with different concentration of genetically modified soybean DNA (0 %; 1 %; 5 %; 10 %; and 20 %) and 5 % standard. The result indicates that duplex PCR has higher correlation than simplex PCR. When detected RRS DNA by multiplex PCR in different cycle number, the best result was in 35 cycle. Detection <b>transgenic</b> <b>gene</b> in RRS used 35 SP-F/R primers and SYBR Green Dye by real-time PCR has high correlation. Duplex PCR and real-time PCR were compared with different concentration (3 %; 8 %; and 13 %) of RRS DNA.

Our results showed that GM soybeans were not only easily detected by multiplex PCR method, but the detection time and cost are also reduced. 中文摘要 本研究為利用雙套式聚合酶鏈反應 (Multiplex PCR) 及半定量分析鑑定方法，評估鑑別檢測基因改造大豆之可行性。首先由自行設計以及參考文獻收錄的引子組進行二次確認，得知產物無偽陽性結果產生。並以 35 SP-F/R (143 bp) 與LEC-F/R (175 bp) 之引子組組合進行多套式PCR。而以不同重量百分濃度 (0 、 1 %、 5 %、 10 %、 20 %及 5 %標準品) 之RRS樣品經由半定量分析結果顯示多套式PCR (R 2 = 0. 9612) 比單套式PCR (R 2 = 0. 9289) 具有較高之相關係數。當以不同之cycle數進行多套式PCR之結果顯示，以 35 cycle之半定量分析結果為最佳。 利用 35 SP-F/R 引子組與SYBR Green螢光染劑進行即時定量聚合酶鏈鎖反應 (real-time PCR) ，偵測RRS樣品中的轉殖基因，結果顯示兩者具有高度之線性相關。而利用重量百分濃度為 3 %、 8 %以及 13 %之RRS樣品同時進行多套式PCR與real-time PCR，數據分析比較後發現半定量分析方法可將RRS樣品區分為 10 %以上或 5 %以下。 本研究所使用之多套式PCR及半定量方法可容易檢出基因改造大豆之檢體，並可大幅降低檢測時間及成本，期有助於基因改造大豆之大量篩選及半定量分析。目 錄 中文摘要 1 Abstract 2 壹、前言 3 貳、文獻回顧 5 一、基因改造生物(Genetically Modified Organisms, GMOs) 簡介 5 （一）基因改造生物發展的必要性 6 （二）基因轉殖作物的發展與現況 8 （三）民眾對於GMO的認知 15 （四）基因改造生物的正面影響 18 （五）基因改造生物的負面影響及潛在疑慮 19 （六）基因改造食品之安全性評估 21 (七）基因改造食品標示 26 1. 台灣方面 27 2. 其他各國方面 31 二、基因改造黃豆之簡介 37 (一) 除草劑Glyphosate之介紹 37 (二) 除草劑Glyphosate抗性黃豆 (Glyphosate-Tolerant Soybean；GTS, Roundup ReadyTM Soybeans; RRS) 之介紹 40 三、基因改造食品檢驗方法 44 (一) 聚合酶鏈鎖反應 (polymerase chain reaction, PCR) 48 1. 巢式PCR (nested PCR) 50 2. 定量PCR 52 (1) 定量競爭聚合酵素鏈反應 (Quantitative competitive PCR, QC-PCR) 52 (2) 即時定量聚合酵素鏈反應 (Real-Time Quantitative PCR, QPCR) 53 (3) 半定量聚合酶鏈鎖反應 (semi-quantitative PCR, SQ-PCR) 55 參、材料與方法 58 一、實驗材料 58 （一）基因改造黃豆 58 （二）緩衝液及試劑配製 58 （三）化學藥品 59 （四）儀器與設備 61 （五）電腦軟體 62 二、實驗方法 62 (一) DNA純化萃取 (DNA Extraction) 62 1. 黃豆DNA萃取 (Plant Genomic DNA Miniprep System) 62 (二) 核酸引子與探針之設計 63 (三) 聚合酶鏈鎖反應(Polymerase Chain Reaction, PCR) 63 1. 單套式PCR 63 2. 雙套式PCR 64 3. 定量PCR 64 4. 洋菜膠體電泳分析 64 肆、結果與討論 67 1. 基因改造黃豆單套及多套式PCR驗證實驗之結果分析 67 (1) 單套式PCR分析 67 (2) 雙套式PCR分析 67 2. 基因改造大豆之半定量分析 71 (1) 單套式PCR分析結果 72 (2) 雙套式PCR分析結果 77 3. 雙套式PCR半定量分析之建立 84 4.

40|$|The recent {{advent of}} {{high-throughput}} <b>transgenic</b> and <b>gene</b> targeting technologies has accelerated {{the generation of}} new genetically engineered mouse (GEM) lines for research and testing. As an example, the International Mouse Knockout Con-sortium has proposed to systematically mutate every gene in the mouse genome, thereby creating more than 20, 000 new embryonic stem cell lines from which null mutant (‘‘knockout’’) mice {{can be made to}} explore gene function in vivo. 2, 4, 6 An enormous number of mice will need to be characterized in the coming decades if this remark-able resource is to yield a rich harvest of scientific information. The recent explosion in the use of GEM i...|$|R
40|$|A new {{strategy}} for creating experimental models for functional genomics has been proposed. It {{is based on}} the expression in <b>transgenic</b> plants of <b>genes</b> from thermophilic bacteria encoding functional analogues of plant proteins with high specific activity and thermal stability. We have validated this strategy by comparing physiological, biochemical and molecular properties of control tobacco plants and <b>transgenic</b> plants expressing <b>genes</b> of beta-glucanases with different substrate specificity. We demonstrate that the expression of bacterial beta- 1, 3 - 1, 4 -glucanase gene exerts no significant influence on tobacco plant metabolism, while the expression of bacterial beta- 1, 3 -glucanase affects plant metabolism only at early stages of growth and development. By contrast, the expression of bacterial beta- 1, 4 -glucanase has a significant effect on transgenic tobacco plant metabolism, namely, it affects plant morphology, the thickness of the primary cell wall, phytohormonal status, and the relative sugar content We propose a hypothesis of beta-glucanase action as an important factor of genetic regulation of metabolic processes in plants...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of therapeutic proteins from transgenic animals {{is one of}} the most important successes of animal biotechnology. Milk is presently the most mature system for {{production of}} therapeutic proteins from a transgenic animal. Specifically, β-casein is a major component of cow, goat and sheep milk, and its promoter has been used to regulate the expression of <b>transgenic</b> <b>genes</b> in the mammary gland of transgenic animals. Here, we cloned the porcine β-casein gene and analyzed the transcriptional activity of the promoter and intron 1 region of the porcine β-casein gene. Sequence inspection of the 5 ′-flanking region revealed potential DNA elements including SRY, CdxA, AML-a, GATA- 3, GATA- 1 and C/EBP β. In addition, the first intron of the porcine β-casein gene contained the transcriptional enhancers Oct- 1, SRY, YY 1, C/EBP β, and AP- 1, as well as the retroviral TATA box. We estimated the transcriptional activity for the 5 ′-proximal region with or without intron 1 of the porcine β-casein gene in HC 11 cells stimulated with lactogenic hormones. High transcriptional activity was obtained for the 5 ′-proximal region with intron 1 of the porcine β-casein gene. The β-casein gene containing the mutant TATA box (CATAAAA) was also cloned from another individual pig. Promoter activity of the luciferase vector containing the mutant TATA box was weaker than the same vector containing the normal TATA box. Taken together, these findings suggest that the transcription of porcine β-casein gene is regulated by lactogenic hormone via intron 1 and promoter containing a mutant TATA box (CATAAAA) has poor porcine β-casein gene activity...|$|R
