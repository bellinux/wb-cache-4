5|$|Both <b>the</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> adult red-backed fairywren may utilise the {{rodent-run}} {{display to}} distract predators from nests with young birds. The head, neck and tail are lowered, the wings are held {{out and the}} feathers are fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call.|$|E
5|$|Both <b>the</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> are {{involved}} in the nest building. The male does most of the work, while the female perches on the shrub or tree where the nest is being built to watch for predators. The nest is built approximately three to ten feet above the ground. The outer part of the nest is composed of twigs, while the inner part is lined with grasses, dead leaves, moss, or artificial fibers. The eggs are a light blue or greenish color and speckled with dots. The female lays three to five eggs, and she incubates them for nearly two weeks. Once the eggs are hatched, both <b>the</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> will feed the chicks.|$|E
5|$|Lead affects both <b>the</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> {{reproductive}} systems. In men, when {{blood lead}} levels exceed 40μg/dL, sperm count is reduced and changes occur in volume of sperm, their motility, and their morphology.|$|E

5|$|The zona incerta, grouped {{between the}} arcuate and periventricular nuclei, {{projects}} to several {{areas of the}} hypothalamus, and participates in the control of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which is necessary to activate the development of <b>the</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> reproductive systems, following puberty.|$|E
5|$|As long {{as winter}} food is available, both <b>the</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> {{will remain in}} the {{territory}} throughout the year, although occupying different areas. Migrants are more gregarious, travelling in small flocks and feeding in loose groups in the wintering grounds. The flight of migrating birds comprises bursts of rapid wing beats interspersed with level or diving movement, and differs from both the normal fast agile flight of this species and the more dipping action of larger thrushes.|$|E

5|$|In July 2010, it was {{confirmed}} that an IRIS graphic novel {{was in the}} works for a Fall 2011 release. Reports of the project, which features the likenesses of Lee Byung-hun and Kim Tae-hee, date back to August 2009, prior to the series airing. Launching first in Japan and later in Korea, the graphic novel retained the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> leads but deviates from the scenarios featured in the original story.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> {{dichotomy}} of polar opposites {{with the}} former oppressing the latter at all times is refuted in the Indian context because it was men who initiated social reform movements against various social evils. Patriarchy {{is just one of}} the hierarchies. Relational hierarchies between women within the same family are more adverse. Here women are pitted against one another. Not all women are powerless at all times.|$|E

5|$|Amplexus between <b>the</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> occurs {{mainly in}} water, but {{sometimes}} at substantial distances away on dry land. Observations of breeding sites {{have shown the}} males linger around the courting area for much longer times, while females mostly stay at other places to find food before meeting the males there. During amplexus, the males grab the females near their armpits after climbing on their backs. In the wild, amplexus usually takes between 10 minutes and five days. Artificially induced amplexus in the laboratory has been observed to last 50 hours, {{but there have been}} reports of five days. Sometimes, amplexus will not result in eggs being laid.|$|E
5|$|Like most brown algae, Postelsia {{goes through}} {{alternation}} of generations, {{and is an}} annual species. The diploid sporophyte produces, through meiosis, haploid spores, which drip down through the grooves in the blades onto the substrate, which may be mussels, barnacles, or bare rock. These spores develop, through mitosis, into small, multicellular haploid gametophytes, male and female. <b>The</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> gametophytes create sperm and eggs, respectively. The sperm of the male reaches the female egg and fertilizes, resulting in a diploid zygote, which develops into a new sporophyte.|$|E
5|$|Other merozoites {{develop into}} {{immature}} gametocytes, {{which are the}} precursors {{of male and female}} gametes. When a fertilized mosquito bites an infected person, gametocytes are taken up with the blood and mature in the mosquito gut. <b>The</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> gametocytes fuse and form an ookinete—a fertilized, motile zygote. Ookinetes develop into new sporozoites that migrate to the insect's salivary glands, ready to infect a new vertebrate host. The sporozoites are injected into the skin, in the saliva, when the mosquito takes a subsequent blood meal.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to analyze}} relationship between individual attitude to the managing family and career. This study {{is based on}} Sander M. M., Lengnick-Hall, C. A., Lengnick-Hall, M. L., & Steele-Clapp, L. (1998) study. Data {{for this study were}} provided by 217 students of the last level of Universities taken from state and private Universities at Yogyakarta. Individual attitude is measured by using CFAM from Sander et al. (1998). Response rate of this study was 95, 2 %. The data were analized by correlationanalysis. This study found eight important results. First, spousal supports and dominances, is positively corrrelated with other scales. Second, for <b>the</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females,</b> is positively correlated significantly between spousal suppports and balances. Third, for <b>the</b> <b>males,</b> is positively correlated significantly between family focus and career focus, whereas it was not for the females. Fourth, for <b>the</b> <b>males,</b> is positively correlated significantly between career focus and balances, whereas it was not for the females. Fifth, for <b>the</b> <b>males,</b> is positively correlated significantly between independences and family focus, whereas it was not for the <b>females.</b> Sixth, for <b>the</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females,</b> is significantly uncorrelated between independences and career focus.

5|$|The {{genitalia}} of <b>the</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> in {{any particular}} species are adapted to fit each other like a lock (male) and key (female). In males, the ninth abdominal segment is divided into a dorsal 'tegumen' and ventral 'viniculum'. They form a ring-like structure for the attachment of genital parts {{and a pair of}} lateral clasping organs (claspers or 'harpe'). The male has a median tubular organ (called the aedeagus) which is extended through an eversible sheath (or 'vesica') to inseminate the female. The males have paired sperm ducts in all lepidopterans; the paired testes are separate in basal taxa and fused in advanced forms.|$|E
5|$|The males sing {{throughout}} much of the construction and even more so when a female approaches his nest. Following copulation, <b>the</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> continue to build the nest. Nests may be in any type of hole, common locations include inside hollowed trees, buildings, tree stumps and man-made nest-boxes. S. v. zetlandicus typically breeds in crevices and holes in cliffs, a habitat only rarely used by the nominate form. Nests are typically made out of straw, dry grass and twigs with an inner lining made up of feathers, wool and soft leaves. Construction usually takes four or five days and may continue through incubation.|$|E

The three plays are titled Ao no Kakusei, Gunjō no Meikyū, and Sōen Kesshō. Persona 4 was also adapted into two stage plays, both produced by Marvelous AQL and receiving limited runs in 2012: Visualive and Visualive the Evolution. A stage play based on Persona 4 Arena was likewise given a limited run in December 2014, and one based on Persona 4 Arena Ultimax ran in July 2016.|$|E
6000|$|In {{favour of}} this hypothesis, Professor Kolliker adduces the {{well-known}} facts of Agamogenesis, or [...] "alternate generation"; the extreme dissimilarity of <b>the</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> of many animals; <b>and</b> of <b>the</b> <b>males,</b> <b>females,</b> <b>and</b> neuters of those insects which live in colonies: and he defines its relations to the Darwinian theory as follows:-- ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>males</b> {{can reach}} 90mm (3.5 inches) from snout to vent (SVL), the females smaller at about 74mm (3 inches) SVL. There {{is a strong}} {{colouration}} difference between <b>the</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> (dichromatism).|$|R

5|$|Both <b>the</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> of {{the species}} reach sexual {{maturity}} after 1 year of life. The breeding season occurs {{in the spring and}} early summer. The males arrive before {{the beginning of the season}} to establish their territories. The males use a series of courtship displays to attract the females to their sites. They run around the area either to showcase their territory to the females or to pursue the females. The males also engage in flight to showcase their wings. They sing and call as they perform all of these displays. The species can remain monogamous for many years, but incidents of polygyny and bigamy have been reported to occur during the bird's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Female loggerheads first {{reproduce}} {{between the}} ages of 17 and 33, and their mating period may last more than six weeks. They court their mates, but these behaviors have not been thoroughly examined. Male forms of courtship behavior include nuzzling, biting, and head and flipper movements. Studies suggest females produce cloacal pheromones to indicate reproductive ability. Before mating, the male approaches a female and attempts to mount her, while she resists. Next, <b>the</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> begin to circle each other. If the male has competitors, the female may let the males struggle with each other. The winner then mounts the female; the male's curved claws usually damage the shoulders of the female's shell during this process. Other courting males bite the male while he is attempting to copulate, damaging his flippers and tail, possibly exposing bones. Such damage can cause the male to dismount and may require weeks to heal.|$|E

Goldwater's most narrow regional loss was in the South, with 48% of {{the popular vote}}, but he lost by greater margins in the East, Midwest and West with 32%, 39% and 40% of the popular vote, respectively. Johnson was heavily favored over Goldwater among Catholics (76% to 24%), and by a smaller margin among Protestants (55% to 45%). Goldwater lost the Independent vote to Johnson (56% to 44%). Johnson won the white vote over Goldwater (59% to 41%) and was heavily favored by the nonwhite electorate (94% to 6%). Goldwater lost the college-educated, high school-educated and grade school-educated population to Johnson (52% to 48%, 62% to 38% and 66% to 34%, respectively).|$|E
50|$|The undersides of both <b>the</b> <b>male's</b> <b>and</b> <b>female's</b> {{wings are}} dark mottled brown, much like tree bark, for {{camouflage}} when the wings are together.
