5|$|By {{the morning}} of August 1, the Tanana River had begun to fall in Fairbanks, just as the Salcha River had begun to recede in Salcha. Though {{isolated}} roads continued to wash out from heavy water flow and residents {{were not allowed to}} return to their homes, the water level of the river continued <b>to</b> <b>fall.</b> <b>Due</b> to this fact, the opening of Fairbanks' Tanana Valley Fair—scheduled for August 1—was not delayed. Despite the falling water level in the Tanana, the Chena River continued to rise due to the differing water levels in the two rivers. This fact caused the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to close the floodgates of the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project at 3:30 a.m. on August 1. They remained closed throughout the day before being reopened at 5:30 a.m. on August 2.|$|E
500|$|Between June9 and 10, Tropical Storm Arlene {{produced}} {{heavy rains}} over western areas of Cuba, leading to school closures in several cities.

2500|$|A {{significant}} drop in precipitation {{occurred in}} the Titicaca Basin, and some archaeologists suggest a great drought occurred. As the rainfall failed, many of the cities furthest away from Lake Titicaca began to produce fewer crops {{to give to the}} elites. As the surplus of food dropped, the elites' power began <b>to</b> <b>fall.</b> <b>Due</b> to the resiliency of the raised fields, the capital city became the last place to maintain agricultural production. With continued drought, people died or moved elsewhere. In isolated places, some remnants of the Tiwanaku people, such as the Uros, may be direct descendants of the people.|$|E

2500|$|To {{ensure that}} the {{government}} could meet both the current and future demands of its governmental accounts, an additional source of funding was required, [...] "for interest payments on the assumed state debts would begin <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>due</b> {{at the end of}} 1791...those payments would require $788,333 annually, and... an additional $38,291 was needed to cover deficiencies in the funds that had been appropriated for existing commitments." [...] To achieve this, Hamilton repeated a suggestion he had made nearly a year before—increase the duty on imported spirits, plus raise the excise tax on domestically distilled whiskey and other liquors. Local opposition to the tax led to the Whiskey Rebellion.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Hussey and Murali Vijay {{opened in}} the chase. In the first over, Lasith Malinga took the wickets of Hussey and Suresh Raina in two {{successive}} deliveries. Subramaniam Badrinath was dismissed in the following over and Chennai's score was 3 for 3. Vijay and Bravo attempted to target Pragyan Ojha and Rishi Dhawan but wickets continued <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>due</b> to poor shot selection and Chennai was reduced to 39 for 6 in the eighth over. This forced Dhoni to bat earlier than his preference of late in the innings. Dhoni attempted to [...] rescue the innings but wickets continued to fall around him. Chennai's innings finally improved in the ninth-wicket partnership between Dhoni and Ashwin, during which Dhoni hit three boundary sixes off the bowling of Ojha and Pollard. The asking rate slowly became unmanagable and Ashwin was dismissed in the 18th over. Dhoni finished with an unbeaten 63 runs and Chennai lost by 23 runs.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the rain}} began Roberts moved {{along the edge}} of the rubber {{plantation}} north-east of Long Phuoc in column towards the heavily swollen Suoi Da Bang. The terracing of the paddy fields resulted in a steep drop to the creek and a difficult climb out; however, using a bullock track alongside a dam he had previously utilised during Operation Hardihood, Roberts began to swim the carriers across the water despite the fast moving current which threatened to wash them downstream. At 18:10 Roberts was ordered for a second time to halt and wait for Townsend. Yet he continued to monitor D Company's situation over the radio and again chose to disregard the order. Mollison concurred, agreeing not to stop for Townsend to catch up, and they proceeded to cross the creek. After completing the dangerous crossing without incident, Roberts left one carrier and its infantry to secure the point and to act as a guide for Townsend, while the remaining seven APCs continued to move towards the battle. Advancing another , the relief force reached the junction of Route 52 and the road running north-west through the rubber plantation by 18:20. The road led directly to the scene of the fighting, and using it as his centre axis, Roberts deployed one section of three APCs on the right commanded by Sergeant Ron Richards and one on the left under Sergeant Leslie O'Reilly, each with two vehicles forward and one back evenly spaced [...] apart, while he remained in the centre moving astride the road. At 18:22 they began to advance on a [...] frontage, only to again be ordered by radio to halt and wait for Townsend. With sunset due at 19:11 and darkness already beginning <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>due</b> to the heavy rain clouds overhead, Roberts once more decided to press on.|$|E

60|$|One {{thing we}} cannot mention without a due thrill of horror: namely, that, {{in the empty}} {{exchequer}} of Dominus Hugo, there was not found one penny to distribute to the Poor that they might pray for his soul! By a kind of godsend, Fifty shillings did, in the very nick of time, fall due, or seem <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>due,</b> {{from one of his}} Farmers (the Firmarius de Palegrava), and he paid it, and the Poor had it; though, alas, this too only seemed <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>due,</b> and we had it to pay again afterwards. Dominus Hugo's apartments were plundered by his servants, to the last portable stool, in a few minutes after the breath was out of his body. Forlorn old Hugo, fare thee well forever.|$|E

The chimney-piece was ornamented with a small almanack, marked {{here and there in}} Mrs Gamp's own hand with a memorandum of the date at which some lady was expected <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>due.</b> It was also embellished with three profiles: one, in colours, of Mrs Gamp herself in early life; one, in bronze, of a lady in feathers, supposed to be Mrs Harris, as she appeared when dressed for a ball; and one, in black, of Mr Gamp, deceased. The last was a full length, in order that the likeness might be rendered more obvious and forcible by the introduction of the wooden leg.|$|E

60|$|Before a {{week was}} out, I {{received}} {{a note from}} Wemmick, dated Walworth, stating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter appertaining to our private and personal capacities, {{and that he would}} be glad if I could come and see him again upon it. So, I went out to Walworth again, and yet again, and yet again, and I saw him by appointment in the City several times, but never held any communication with him on the subject in or near Little Britain. The upshot was, that we found a worthy young merchant or shipping-broker, not long established in business, who wanted intelligent help, and who wanted capital, and who in due course of time and receipt would want a partner. Between him and me, secret articles were signed of which Herbert was the subject, and I paid him half of my five hundred pounds down, and engaged for sundry other payments: some, <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>due</b> at certain dates out of my income: some, contingent on my coming into my property. Miss Skiffins's brother conducted the negotiation. Wemmick pervaded it throughout, but never appeared in it.|$|E

I had altogether three letters in the time of our separation. One was to announce their arrival in the town of Dunkirk in France, from which place James shortly after started alone upon a private mission. This was to England and to see Lord Holderness; and it has always been a bitter thought that my good money helped to pay the charges of the same. But he has need of a long spoon who sups with the deil, or James More either. During this absence, the time was <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>due</b> for another letter; and as the letter was the condition of his stipend, he had been so careful as prepare it beforehand and leave it with Catriona to be despatched.

Such injuries are often no worse than torn calluses, cuts, burns and bruises. However, overuse symptoms, if ignored, may lead to permanent damage (esp. to tendons, tendon sheaths, ligaments, and joint capsules).|$|R

50|$|Originally, it {{was thought}} that {{ecosystems}} increase uniformly in ascendency as they developed, but subsequent empirical observation has suggested that all sustainable ecosystems are confined to a narrow “window of vitality” (Ulanowicz 2002).
