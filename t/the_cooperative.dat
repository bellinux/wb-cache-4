5|$|<b>The</b> <b>cooperative</b> {{gameplay}} {{originated from}} players' requests and from anecdotes of players {{working together on}} the same computer or console to solve the game's puzzles. Wolpaw likened this to players working together on the same computer to solve point-and-click adventure games. <b>The</b> <b>cooperative</b> campaign was also inspired by Valve's Left 4 Dead cooperative games, in which players enjoyed discussing their personal experiences with the game when they had finished playing it. While the single player campaign in Portal 2 is designed to avoid frustrating the player, <b>the</b> <b>cooperative</b> levels focus on coordination and communication, and Valve recognizes {{they are much more}} difficult than the single-player puzzles. Valve did not include timed puzzles in the single-player campaigns in Portal and Portal 2, but found that their inclusion in <b>the</b> <b>cooperative</b> mode is effective and gives players a positive feeling after they successfully plan and execute difficult maneuvers. Each puzzle chamber in <b>the</b> <b>cooperative</b> mode requires four portals to solve to prevent puzzles being solved by the actions of only one player. As soon as a playtester discovered a way to complete a puzzle with one set of portals, the level was sent back to the designers for further work. Except in a few cases, Valve designed the chambers so that both players would remain in sight of each other to promote communication and cooperation. Some of the puzzle chambers were designed asymmetrically; one player would manipulate portals and controls to allow the other player to cross the room, emphasizing that the two characters, while working together, are separate entities. The designers soon realized that the ability to tag surfaces with instructional icons for one's partner was a necessary element, since they found this to be more effective for cooperation than simple, verbal instructions.|$|E

The team revisited level ideas {{that did not}} fit on the previous console, and transitioned from synthesized music and a text-based story to an orchestral soundtrack and voice acting. <b>The</b> <b>cooperative</b> mode was also added retroactively, which challenged the already finalized level design. The most pronounced improvements were in the game's graphics and upgrades. Levels on the Xbox 360 could hold thousands of characters on-screen at once. The team playtested the feel of each elemental warrior and spent extra time refining the gradual difficulty increase in the opening level. In reflection, the project's biggest influences were ultimately Nintendo, Pokémon, and Resident Evil.|$|E

5|$|As already described, chiral liquid-crystal {{molecules}} usually {{give rise}} to chiral mesophases.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the crisis faced by <b>the</b> <b>cooperatives</b> in Bulgaria {{during the period}} of transition beginning in 1990 when the collapse of the socialist agricultural system started.

The conclusion is that <b>the</b> <b>cooperatives</b> have failed to adapt successfully to the changed economic and political situation in the 1990 s rather insisting on continuing with the old socialist mechanisms of collective production lacking new high tech investments and young people with initiative. The philosophy of the transition emphasizing the individual rather than the collective has contributed to the political isolation of <b>the</b> <b>cooperatives</b> and, as a consequence, to their lack of investments and credit.

5|$|Portal 2 is a first-person {{perspective}} puzzle game. The Player {{takes the}} role of Chell in the single-player campaign, as one of two robotsAtlas and P-Bodyin <b>the</b> <b>cooperative</b> campaign, or as a simplistic humanoid icon in community-developed puzzles. These four characters can explore and interact with the environment. Characters can withstand limited damage but will die after sustained injury. There is no penalty for falling onto a solid surface, but falling into bottomless pits or toxic pools kills the player character immediately. When Chell dies in the single-player game, the game restarts from a recent checkpoint; in <b>the</b> <b>cooperative</b> game, the robot respawns shortly afterwards without restarting the puzzle. The goal of both campaigns is to explore the Aperture Science Laboratory—a complicated, malleable mechanized maze. While most of the game takes place in modular test chambers with clearly defined entrances and exits, other parts occur in behind-the-scenes areas where the objective is less clear.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} part of the {{evaluation}} of a development project in Serbia, where cooperatives have been formed {{in order to make the}} members support themselves trough organic farming. The purpose of the paper has been to find out if the goal of making the current members and potential new members able to support themselves on what <b>the</b> <b>cooperatives</b> produce, has been reached. The goal is to be considered as partly fulfilled; according to the last annual report from Odraz, “the registered cooperatives have become fully functional and stable and they have started making some modest profit. ”…“the majority of the beneficiaries think that they are self-reliant”…. In order to find out what is required in order to fulfil the established goal entirely, (for example there are no reports of that new members have been recruited, and the fact that most, not all, current members of <b>the</b> <b>cooperatives</b> (<b>the</b> beneficiaries) say that they are supplied from what <b>the</b> <b>cooperatives</b> produce), I have tried to identify the conditions which <b>the</b> <b>cooperatives</b> operate under. <b>The</b> basis of the paper consists of a literature review, interviews with the directors of <b>the</b> <b>cooperatives,</b> a questionnaire dealing with the business environment and various external sources in Serbia. The members have received training, but with some doubt regarding its applicability, according to the enquiry performed by Odraz. Study circle/adult education classes and similar can be a good way to supplement and to further develop these skills, however, the access to these and other higher educational forms remain unclear according to the business climate enquiry. Knowledge of what the market demands, laws and regulations from government agencies, certification bodies and research within the profession requires constant updating. The access to media is high, as well as information provided through counselling according to the business climate enquiry, however, the members lack information gained through research. Media independence in Serbia should not be considered as a matter of course according to the literature review. A safe home-environment is a necessity for the members in order for them to have full focus on the running of <b>the</b> <b>cooperatives.</b> This need is to be considered fulfilled when the members got their houses. According to the business climate enquiry, the members have high confidence in their neighbours, associations, police and judiciary, aid organizations, salesmen and local and national policymakers. By contrast, confidence in the banks is low or nonexistent. The confidence of purchasers is unclear. According to the Odraz enquiry, there is a problem with the members' (especially the women's) lack of motivation to participate in practical work of <b>the</b> <b>cooperatives.</b> This and inner conflicts pose a threat to the existence and development of <b>the</b> <b>cooperatives.</b> According to <b>the</b> literature review, financial aid is available in form of subsidises from the government and probably also from the EU in the future. According to the business-climate enquiry, the members lack access to incentives, inspiration and new impressions from special interest organizations. They also lack inspiration and new impressions from trade fairs, exhibitions and conferences. Whether there are incentives from banks, the EU, politicians, businesses and the society in general is unclear according to the business climate enquiry. To what degree the later ones affect the members is unclear according to the business climate enquiry. Drought, late frost, wind, hail and the humid climate may be challenges, according to the interviews with the directors of <b>the</b> <b>cooperatives,</b> but otherwise, <b>the</b> climate is an asset, the quality of the soil is very high and there is enough water of good quality, according to the literature review. However, <b>the</b> <b>cooperatives</b> limited access to arable land can restrain the development of <b>the</b> <b>cooperatives.</b> A large part of the farms in Serbia is small and fragmented according to the literature review. This could be a disadvantage for Serbia and <b>the</b> <b>cooperatives</b> in <b>the</b> competition with the outside world because the inefficient use of the arable land that could mean higher costs, according to the literature review. A future possible membership in the EU is supported by a convincing majority of the members according to the business climate enquiry, which is a higher share than in the rest of the country. The process to certify <b>the</b> <b>cooperatives</b> has taken a long time, but it is a necessity that allows them to get a higher price for their products. The cooperatives' access to capital and land can be a crucial factor for their survival, but the availability of these factors is unclear according to the business climate inquiry. According to the same enquiry, the availability of skilled workers is low. This does not affect the development of <b>the</b> <b>cooperatives</b> at <b>the</b> moment, but may become a limiting factor in the future. It is unclear according to the business climate enquiry, if gender, origin, language, religion, or lack of childcare is an obstacle in order for people to get a job. The availability and quality of the infrastructure in all its forms may be well below the known, both according to the literature review and the business climate enquiry. This constitutes a clear obstacle to <b>the</b> development of <b>cooperatives.</b> <b>The</b> outlet possibilities for the cooperatives' products in the domestic market is according to the business climate enquiry high, while no conclusions can be drawn regarding their attitude towards the global market. However, a number of things indicate that there is no domestic market in Serbia at present according to the literature review, and it seems like <b>the</b> <b>cooperatives</b> have no alternative than to try to export their products if they still want to produce organically. Storage facilities may have to be required if they are to offer the purchasers the continuity, quality and quantity that they demand, according to the literature review. At present, refinement of the products do not appear to be an alternative, the volumes are too small. The project can from many perspectives be considered successful. The factors which the members of <b>the</b> <b>cooperatives</b> feel that they lack are all external circumstances that IM-SOIR has no influence over. In my opinion their followers, Odraz need to continue to be a link between <b>the</b> <b>cooperatives</b> and authorities, <b>the</b> certification company, purchases and banks. In the absent of special interests organizations, they need to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>cooperatives</b> remaining needs get attention from those decision makers who can change the situation, and thereby raise <b>the</b> <b>cooperatives</b> capability to support current and future members. <b>The</b> <b>cooperatives</b> are not yet able to do all that on their own. To sum it all up, the domestic market was quite overrated when the project was planned and that has restrained the development of <b>the</b> <b>cooperatives.</b> More efforts should have been put on reaching the global market already from the beginning...|$|R
