5|$|Additional {{caution is}} {{required}} in the elderly, as they are {{more sensitive to the}} pharmacological effects of benzodiazepines, metabolise <b>them</b> <b>more</b> slowly, and are more prone to adverse effects, including drowsiness, amnesia (especially anterograde amnesia), ataxia, hangover effects, confusion, and falls.|$|E

5|$|Anarchism is a {{political}} philosophy that advocates self-governed societies based on voluntary institutions. These are often described as stateless societies, although several authors have defined <b>them</b> <b>more</b> specifically as institutions based on non-hierarchical or free associations.|$|E
5|$|Any form {{of muscle}} damage of {{sufficient}} severity can cause rhabdomyolysis. Multiple causes can be present simultaneously in one person. Some have an underlying muscle condition, usually hereditary in nature, that makes <b>them</b> <b>more</b> prone to rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
5|$|Damage from Rick {{was fairly}} minor. As Rick was heading towards Mexico, {{the people on}} the {{coastline}} evacuated due to the impact of Pauline making <b>them</b> <b>more</b> prepared to deal with another hurricane, leading to no casualties.|$|E

50|$|Polls {{showed that}} 11% of those {{eligible}} {{to vote in}} the leadership election said that the incident had improved their view of Corbyn, while 20% said that it had given <b>them</b> a <b>more</b> negative view. However, amongst Corbyn supporters, 18% said that it had given <b>them</b> a <b>more</b> positive view of him, against 5% who said that it had given <b>them</b> a <b>more</b> negative view. The Independent suggested that this was due to Corbyn being seen to make a stand against an unpopular operator.|$|R

5|$|Even though Opera Mini {{is based}} on the same {{rendering}} engine as Opera for personal computers, it does not pass the Acid2 test. This is because Opera Mini intentionally reformats web pages to try to make <b>them</b> <b>more</b> suitable for devices with small screens.|$|E
5|$|Increasing ozone {{pollution}} is causing tissue {{damage to the}} massive giant sequoia trees in the park, making <b>them</b> <b>more</b> vulnerable to insect infestation and disease. Since the cones of these trees require fire-touched soil to germinate, historic fire suppression has reduced these trees' ability to reproduce. The current policy of setting prescribed fires is expected to help the germination issue.|$|E
5|$|Insurers {{claimed that}} because {{they have access to}} and collect patient data that allow {{evaluations}} of interventions, they are essential to ACO success. Large insurers formed their own ACOs. Many hospitals merged and purchased physician practices. The increased market share gave <b>them</b> <b>more</b> leverage in negotiations with insurers over costs and reduced patient care options.|$|E
50|$|As solitary bees, L. figueresi {{interact}} differently {{with the}} environment around <b>them.</b> Sometimes <b>more</b> than one female works on a nest, which affects the {{size and scope of}} the nest. Additionally, females have a routine that helps <b>them</b> become <b>more</b> effective at providing for their offspring.|$|R

5|$|Skelton and Edna {{worked for}} a year in Camden, New Jersey, {{and were able to}} get an {{engagement}} at Montreal's Lido Club in 1934 through a friend who managed the chorus lines at New York's Roxy Theatre. Despite an initial rocky start, the act was a success, and brought <b>them</b> <b>more</b> theater dates throughout Canada.|$|E
5|$|They {{released}} Act of Depression, Cries of the Past, and The Changing of Times {{with the}} band's original vocalist Dallas Taylor. Following his departure, Spencer Chamberlain became lead vocalist. The band then released They're Only Chasing Safety and Define the Great Line, gaining a certified gold rating for both. These two albums have given <b>them</b> <b>more</b> mainstream and commercial success.|$|E

5|$|A major {{technological}} {{application of}} this information is metabolic engineering. Here, organisms such as yeast, plants or bacteria are genetically modified to make <b>them</b> <b>more</b> useful in biotechnology and aid the production of drugs such as antibiotics or industrial chemicals such as 1,3-propanediol and shikimic acid. These genetic modifications usually aim {{to reduce the amount}} of energy used to produce the product, increase yields and reduce the production of wastes.|$|E
5|$|Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) {{is used by}} the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration {{and other}} {{agencies}} to express the activity of individual tropical cyclones that are above tropical storm strength and entire tropical cyclone seasons. It is calculated by taking the squares of the estimated maximum sustained velocity of every active tropical storm (wind speed 35 knots or higher) at six-hour intervals. The numbers are usually divided by 10,000 to make <b>them</b> <b>more</b> manageable. The unit of ACE is 104 kn2, and for use as an index the unit is assumed. As well as being squared for ACE, wind speed can also be cubed, which {{is referred to as the}} Power Dissipation Index (PDI).|$|E
5|$|Another common {{condition}} is otitis externa (outer ear infections), which {{is common to}} a variety of spaniels, as the long floppy ears trap moisture, making <b>them</b> <b>more</b> prone to recurrent infections than dogs with more upright ears. The infections can be caused by a variety of reasons including mites, ear fungi and generally dirt and germs. Treatment is relatively simple and can range from prescribed antibiotics to over-the-counter ear cleaning liquids.|$|E

60|$|I suppose I 'ad {{been sitting}} down {{waiting for him}} for about ten minutes, when a couple o' sailormen came into the bar and began to make {{themselves}} a nuisance.

60|$|But with {{a closer}} {{knowledge}} of our fellow-creatures has come toleration, pity, sympathy. And as that sympathy has been freely obeyed, it has justified itself more and more. The more {{we have tried}} to help our fellow-men, the more easy we have found it to help <b>them.</b> The <b>more</b> we have trusted <b>them,</b> the <b>more</b> trustworthy we have found <b>them.</b> The <b>more</b> we have treated them as human beings, the more humanity we have found in them. And thus man, in proportion as he becomes manifest to man, is seen, in spite of all defects and sins, to be hallowed with a light from God who made him.|$|R
5|$|Another legacy was the Arbeitsstab Wiederaufbau zerstörter Städte (Working {{group on}} Reconstruction of {{destroyed}} cities), authorized by Speer in 1943 to rebuild bombed German cities to make <b>them</b> <b>more</b> livable {{in the age}} of the automobile. Headed by Wolters, the working group took a possible military defeat into their calculations. The Arbeitsstabs recommendations served as the basis of the postwar redevelopment plans in many cities, and Arbeitsstab members became prominent in the rebuilding.|$|E
5|$|Bigger {{guns were}} developed, {{and in the}} 15thcentury became an {{alternative}} to siege engines such as the trebuchet. The benefits of large guns over trebuchets– the most effective siege engine of the Middle Ages {{before the advent of}} gunpowder– were those of a greater range and power. In an effort to make <b>them</b> <b>more</b> effective, guns were made ever bigger, although this hampered their ability to reach remote castles. By the 1450s guns were the preferred siege weapon, and their effectiveness was demonstrated by Mehmed II at the Fall of Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|By 1761, the Maratha menace had diminished and by 1763, Haider Ali had {{captured}} the Keladi kingdom, defeated {{the rulers of}} Bilgi, Bednur and Gutti, invaded the Malabar {{in the south and}} conquered the Zamorin's capital Calicut with ease in 1766 and extended the Mysore kingdom up to Dharwad and Bellary in the north. Mysore was now a major political power in the subcontinent and Haider's meteoric rise from relative obscurity and his defiance formed one of the last remaining challenges to complete British hegemony over the Indian subcontinent – a challenge which would take <b>them</b> <b>more</b> than three decades to overcome.|$|E

50|$|Counterfeiting in Texas hold <b>'em</b> <b>more</b> {{often leads}} to ties, like in the example above, but can also result in losses. For example, if the flop is J-T-9, K-Q is the best {{possible}} hand. But if the turn card is a queen, a player who held K-Q will now be counterfeited and able to lose to a player with A-K.|$|R
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 2002, the band {{released}} their follow-up Give <b>'Em</b> <b>More</b> Rope, and Angry Planet Records signed an exclusive licensing deal with Netherlands-based Corazong Records to release the Ghoultown U.S. catalog in Europe and Canada. The first Euro-Canadian release was a special version of Tales from the Dead West, which included tracks from their Boots of Hell EP as well.|$|R
