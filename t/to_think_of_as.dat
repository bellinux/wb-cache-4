500|$|Weber {{was also}} {{influenced}} by Kantian ethics, which he nonetheless came <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> obsolete in a modern age lacking in religious certainties. In this last respect, the influence of Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy is evident. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the [...] "deep tension between the Kantian moral imperatives and a Nietzschean diagnosis of the modern cultural world is apparently what gives such a darkly tragic and agnostic shade to Weber's ethical worldview". Another major influence in Weber's life was the writings of Karl Marx and the workings of socialist thought in academia and active politics. While Weber shares some of Marx's consternation with bureaucratic systems and maligns them as being capable of advancing their own logic {{to the detriment of}} human freedom and autonomy, Weber views conflict as perpetual and inevitable and does not host the spirit of a materially available utopia. Though the influence of his mother's Calvinist religiosity is evident throughout Weber's life and work, and though he maintained a deep, lifelong interest in the study of religions, Weber was open {{about the fact that he}} was personally irreligious.|$|E

2500|$|... {{the last}} in a long {{evolution}} of that particular type of Mannerism in which a private mystical form of religious emotion is expressed in terms which appear at first sight to be merely those of empty aristocratic elegance. The founder of this tradition was Parmigianino, who invented many of the formulas used by his successors, such as the elongation of the figures, the small heads on long necks, the sweeping draperies, the strained, nervous poses of the hands, and the sweet ecstatic smile which those of Protestant upbringing find it hard not <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> sickly and insincere, but which incorporates {{a particular kind of}} mystical feeling.|$|E
2500|$|An unrepentant lifelong doodler and sketcher, Saint-Exupéry had {{for many}} years sketched little people on his napkins, tablecloths, letters to paramours and friends, lined {{notebooks}} and other scraps of paper. Early figures took on a multitude of appearances, engaged {{in a variety of}} tasks. Some appeared as doll-like figures, baby puffins, angels with wings, and even a figure similar to that in Robert Crumb's later famous Keep On Truckin' of 1968. In a 1940 letter to a friend he sketched a character with his own thinning hair, sporting a bow tie, viewed as a boyish alter-ego, and he later gave a similar doodle to Elizabeth Reynal at his New York publisher's office. Most often the diminutive figure was expressed as [...] "...a slip of a boy with a turned up nose, lots of hair, long baggy pants that were too short for him and with a long scarf that whipped in the wind. Usually the boy had a puzzled expression... his boy Saint-Exupéry came <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> [...] "the little prince," [...] and he was usually found standing on top of a tiny planet. Most of the time he was alone, sometimes walking up a path. Sometimes there was a single flower on the planet." [...] His characters were frequently seen chasing butterflies; when asked why they did so, Saint-Exupéry, who thought of the figures as his alter-egos, replied that they were actually pursuing a [...] "realistic ideal". Saint-Exupéry eventually settled on the image of the young, precocious child with curly blond hair, an image which would become the subject of speculations as to its source. [...] One [...] "most striking" [...] illustration depicted the pilot-narrator asleep beside his stranded plane prior to the prince's arrival. Although images of the narrator were created for the story, none survived Saint-Exupéry's editing process.|$|E

40|$|Perceiving gender {{differences}} as natural or learned {{has important implications}} for the self. Here it was hypothesized that, compared to thinking <b>of</b> gender <b>as</b> learned (i. e., a social constructivist theory), thinking <b>of</b> gender <b>as</b> natural (i. e., an essentialist theory) would lead to a more external locus of control, less perceived ability and persistence, and stronger stereotypical associations of men with science and women with the liberal arts. Participants were randomly assigned to read an article that primed either a social constructivist or an essentialist theory. Participant gender moderated how the prime affected locus of control, perceived ability, and implicit associations. After being primed <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> gender <b>as</b> natural, men had more external locus of control and less perceived ability than after being primed <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> gender <b>as</b> learned. In contrast, after being primed <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> gender <b>as</b> natural, women had less external locus of control and greater perceived ability than after being primed <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> gender <b>as</b> learned. These results are discussed through the lens of the Self-Serving Attributional Bias (SSAB) and Worldview Verification Theory. Through the SSAB, men would prefer <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{gender differences}} <b>as</b> learned because this worldview allows them <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> gender disparities in power (that are often in their favor) as due to somewhat controllable factors. Women would prefer <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> gender <b>as</b> learned because this worldview allows them to instead frame gender disparities in power (that are often not in their favor) as due to uncontrollable factors. Combined with Worldview Verification Theory (i. e., people react with emotional distress when they encounter information that contradicts their worldviews), these results indicate that people may have had more external locus of control, less perceived ability, and been slower to make stereotypical associations after being primed with the lay theory that contradicted their preferred worldviews...|$|R
