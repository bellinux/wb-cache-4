5|$|Edward I knighted Guy de Beauchamp at Easter 1296. Warwick's {{career of}} public service started with the Falkirk {{campaign}} in 1298. Here he distinguished himself, and received a reward of Scottish lands worth 1000 marks a year. At this point his father was already dead, {{but it was not}} until 5 September <b>that</b> <b>Guy</b> did homage to the king for his lands, and became Earl of Warwick and hereditary High Sheriff of Worcestershire for life. He continued in the king's service in Scotland and elsewhere. In 1299 he was present at the king's wedding to Margaret of France at Canterbury, and in 1300 he took part in the Siege of Caerlaverock. The next year he was a signatory to a letter to the Pope, rejecting Rome's authority over the Scottish question, and also participated in negotiations with the French over the release of the Scottish King John Balliol.

25|$|The {{news about}} the siege of Tiberias caused a new {{conflict}} among the crusaders, because Raymond and Ridefort proposed adverse strategies. Emphasizing that the town could resist even a prolonged siege, Raymond wanted to avoid a pinched battle. He also proposed <b>that</b> <b>Guy</b> should send envoys to Antioch and ask Bohemond III to send reinforcements. Hearing Raymond’s proposal, Ridefort and Châtillon accused him of cowardice, adding that passivity would cost the king his kingdom. Since the king was obviously willing to accept Raymond's proposal, Ridefort reminded him Raymond's previous alliance with Saladin. Finally, the king decided to attack and ordered his army to march towards Tiberias.|$|E
25|$|The fact that, {{for many}} years, no other {{scholars}} besides Smith {{were known to}} have seen the manuscript contributed to the suspicions of forgery.

In response to the idea that Smith had kept other scholars from inspecting the manuscript, Scott G. Brown noted that he was in no position to do so. The manuscript was still where Smith had left it when Stroumsa and company found it eighteen years later, and it did not disappear until many years after its relocation to Jerusalem and its separation from the book.|$|E

25|$|Othon's wife {{name was}} Isabel (and its variant Elisabeth). She is {{generally}} {{described as the}} daughter and heiress of Guy, lord of Ray-sur-Saône in the Free County of Burgundy. According to Longnon however, she {{was the daughter of}} Clarembaud IV of Chappes, a lord from Champagne. She gave birth to two sons, Guy and Othon. Othon inherited the lordship of Ray. Guy is traditionally held to have inherited La Roche, while the duchy is said to have passed to a nephew of Othon's also named Guy. Longnon has challenged this view according to a chart in which Othon of Ray, son of Othon de la Roche, presents the duke Guy as his brother - meaning <b>that</b> <b>Guy</b> would be Othon's son and not his nephew. While most members of the La Roche family lived in the Free County of Burgundy, some of them settled in Athens. For instance, a great-grandson of his, Walter, {{was a member of the}} Chapter of the Parthenon in 1292.|$|E
25|$|Balian {{remained}} in the kingdom, as an advisor to Guy. At the end of 1186, Saladin, the sultan of Egypt and Damascus, threatened {{the borders of the}} kingdom after Guy's ally Raynald of Châtillon, Lord of Oultrejordain, had attacked a Muslim caravan. Saladin was allied with the garrison of Tiberias in the north of the kingdom, a territory held by Raymond III. Guy gathered his army at Nazareth, planning to besiege Tiberias, but Balian disagreed with this, and instead suggested <b>that</b> <b>Guy</b> send an emissary to Raymond in Tripoli, hoping the two could be reconciled before Guy made a foolish attack on Saladin's larger army. The first embassy was a failure and the situation remained unchanged throughout the early months of 1187. After Easter of that year, Balian, Gerard of Ridefort (Grand Master of the Knights Templar), Roger de Moulins (Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller), Reginald of Sidon, and Joscius, Archbishop of Tyre were sent on a new embassy to Tripoli. During the journey they stopped at Balian's fief of Nablus, and Balian planned to remain behind briefly while the others went ahead. On May 1, the Templars and Hospitallers were defeated by Saladin's son al-Afdal at the Battle of Cresson; Balian was still a day behind, and had also stopped at Sebastea to celebrate a feast day. After reaching the castle of La Fève, where the Templars and Hospitallers had camped, he found that the place was deserted, and soon heard news of the disastrous battle from the few survivors. Raymond heard about the battle as well and met the embassy at Tiberias, and agreed to accompany them back to Jerusalem.|$|E
