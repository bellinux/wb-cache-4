40|$|Two {{thermoresistant}} {{acetic acid}} bacteria (TAAB) were previously isolated and selected for a sustainable development of vinegar fermentation in Subsaharan Africa. Their {{use as a}} starter culture in vinegar manufactures in such regions could reduce considerably water cooling expenses. For optimising biomass preservation, the effect of 20 % w/w mannitol as cryoprotectant on the cells viability after freeze-drying process and during storage was evaluated. Results showed that freeze-dried cells could be conserved at 4 degrees C for at least 6 months without loss of viability. The main reasons were that cryoprotectant tends {{to lower the water}} activity (a(w)) and to maintain a <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> weaker than that of the glass transition temperature T-g. Furthermore, the heat resistance of freeze-dried cells during storage was all the more increased that strains were cryoprotected. In addition, intrinsically, an increase of saturated fatty acids with the temperature is the essential modification in the lipidome level of membrane cells when the fermentation occured at a temperature of 30 degrees C. Tolerance to heat during storage was significantly enhanced under such mechanisms. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|E

However, the merit of plastic products will disappear if cooling not enough. Generally speaking, cooling channel is consisted of straight-line cooling channel or cooling channel combination in a mold. This way has a demerit, which is freedom low, and caused uneven temperature distribution on the product surfaces. To resolve this problem, we proposed the block laminated method. This way is use laminated block to create a space with a particular shape in the mold. Block laminated method have some merits, for example, Cooling channel has a high freedom and easy to obtain a uniformity cooling.

Of the three methods mentioned in this article, theoretical and numerical methods {{can be used to}} determine an estimate of the heat sink or component <b>temperatures</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> before a physical model has been made. A theoretical model is normally used as a first order estimate. Online heat sink calculators can provide a reasonable estimate of forced and natural convection heat sink performance based on a combination of theoretical and empirically derived correlations. Numerical methods or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provide a qualitative (and sometimes even quantitative) prediction of fluid flows. What this means is that it will give a visual or post-processed result of a simulation, like the images in figures 16 and 17, and the CFD animations in figure 18 and 19, but the quantitative or absolute accuracy of the result is sensitive to the inclusion and accuracy of the appropriate parameters.|$|R
