25|$|We may {{be heading}} not for general {{breakdown}} but for an epoch as horribly stable as the slave empires of antiquity. James Burnham's {{theory has been}} much discussed, but few people have yet considered its ideological implications – this is, the kind of world-view, the kind of beliefs, and the social structure <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> prevail in a State which was at once unconquerable and in a permanent state of 'cold war' with its neighbours.|$|E
25|$|Large {{and swift}} mammals are stalked and shot with bow and arrow. Smaller and {{burrowing}} mammals are usually captured by hand. Because Aché hunting {{has been extensively}} studied using focal follow and other systematic methods, the encounter rates with prey, the time required for a successful pursuit, and the expected energy gains from prey types, are all well known. This has allowed for numerous tests of specific decision models from Optimal Foraging Theory to be tested using Aché data. Results generally {{support the notion that}} Aché hunters pursue only those prey types that would increase their energy return rates, and pass by some species (many small birds, rodents, reptiles, etc.) <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> lower overall foraging returns if pursued.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{reaching}} Elephant Island, Crean {{was one of}} the [...] "four fittest men" [...] detailed by Shackleton to find a safe camping-ground. Shackleton decided that, {{rather than}} waiting for a rescue ship <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> never arrive, one of the lifeboats should be strengthened so that a crew could sail it to South Georgia and arrange a rescue. After the party was settled on a penguin rookery above the high-water mark, a group of men led by ship's carpenter Harry McNish began modifying one of the lifeboats—the James Caird—in preparation for this journey, which Shackleton would lead. Frank Wild, who would be in command of the party remaining on Elephant Island, wanted the dependable Crean to stay with him; Shackleton initially agreed, but changed his mind after Crean begged {{to be included in the}} boat's crew of six.|$|E
500|$|In June, Lindelof and Cuse {{were interviewed}} by The Hollywood Reporter and they {{revealed}} the ultimate {{plan for the}} mobisodes. [...] The mobisodes would air during the hiatus between {{the third and fourth}} seasons and would give viewers interesting information <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> not be found in the show; the average mobisode would only be one and a half minutes long. [...] In the third season, the writers tried to integrate two previously unseen crash survivors named Nikki Fernandez (Kiele Sanchez) and Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro) into the story, but the pair was negatively received for their abrupt appearance and the writers killed them off after seven appearances. [...] Lindelof and Cuse learned from their mistake and decided that the mobisodes would focus on the regular Lost cast. [...] The writers were paid $800 per mobisode, whereas the actors received $425 per mobisode. [...] Actors were contracted to receive more money if the mobisode were reused in another medium.|$|E
500|$|The {{design team}} for the series {{conceived}} eighteen outfits to compliment Gaga's [...] and eccentric reputation, although they did not collaborate with any of Gaga's stylists or creative director Nicola Formichetti. Due to the outfits' unconventional appearances, Jean was given more freedom to animate the large array of costumes, as these rapid changes [...] "wouldn't be possible in real life". [...] "There's {{a moment in the}} episode," [...] Jean resumed, [...] "when she starts out with her hair down. Then, there's a curtain pulled in front of her, and in seconds, she has a completely different outfit on with a cone bra and her hair is all hairsprayed up and big and frizzy. In real life, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> take 8 hours." [...] Many of the costumes were inspired from previous outfits Gaga had worn, including her meat dress and her Kermit the Frog dress. [...] "We did a lot of research, looking back at her old outfits, and she's really been in a million different things, had a million different looks." ...|$|E

500|$|Above the orlop lay {{the main}} deck which housed the {{heaviest}} guns. The {{side of the}} hull on the main deck level had seven gunports on each side fitted with heavy lids {{that would have been}} watertight when closed. This was also the highest deck that was caulked and waterproof. Along the sides of the main deck there were cabins under the forecastle and sterncastle which have been identified as belonging to the carpenter, barber-surgeon, pilot and possibly also the master gunner and some of the officers. The top deck in the hull structure was the upper deck (or weather deck) which was exposed to the elements in the waist. It was a dedicated fighting deck without any known partitions and a mix of heavy and light guns. Over the open waist the upper deck was entirely covered with a coarse netting as a defence measure against boarding. Though very little of the upper deck has survived, {{it has been suggested that}} it housed the main living quarters of the crew underneath the sterncastle. A drainage located in this area has been identified as a possible [...] "piss-dale", a general urinal to complement the regular toilets <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> have been located in the bow.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for Billboard, Jason Lipshutz {{described}} [...] "Artpop" [...] as Gaga's manifesto about her creativity, {{calling it a}} [...] "lurching electro-jazz beast" [...] who's beats became louder and complex as it reached climax. Consisting of strings, the techno song has a beat similar to Selena Gomez's 2011 single [...] "Love You like a Love Song" [...] with its electronic composition, and a groove comparable to singer Kylie Minogue's 2001 hit single [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head". Interspersed between are computerized musical sounds and the chorus, which has a coo-ing accompanied with the main vocals, like Michael Jackson, and was described by Kevin Harley from The Independent as [...] "sleek Eurodisco". [...] "Artpop"s lyrics have been deduced to be a statement about [...] "the subjectivity of art". It begins with the singer uttering the lines [...] "Come to me with all your subtext of fantasy", the line being an indicative of enigma around her, according to The Huffington Post. Gaga explained the lyrics were a metaphor about love with the chorus line [...] "We could belong together, Artpop". She believed that if her fans and herself could be together, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> mean a bonding for art and pop too. On the contrary, Jim Farber from New York Daily News believed that the love relationship was sidelined for that between art and pop with the lyrics.|$|E
2500|$|Cage's fight {{style in}} the series was called [...] "smack-fu" [...] by Coker, {{referring}} {{to the way he}} tried not to punch anybody since <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> kill them with his super strength. To film the effect of bullets bouncing off of Cage, remote controlled devices were attached to Colter and operated by somebody behind the cameras. The devices had the ability to [...] "burn the skin if not attached properly to clothing, and [...] once almost lost hearing in one ear when he forgot to insert the required ear pieces." [...] The third episode begins with a couch coming out of the window of the fictional Crispus Attucks complex in Harlem. This was a tease of a large fight scene shown in full later in the episode, on which Coker said, [...] "You're already anticipating what's going to happen, so when you finally do get to that moment and then the music kicks in, it takes on this new energy." [...] The fight itself is the series' version of the 'superhero hallway fight' made famous in Daredevil, with Coker explaining, [...] "We wanted to do something that, while in the same realm, was its own thing ... That's what this whole show is about, ultimately, being able to do the superhero thing with flavor." [...] Filming for the fight was influenced by [...] "Arnold Schwarzenegger’s invading the police station in Terminator", {{and was one of the}} toughest sequences for the crew to shoot; it took a 14-hour day, and Colter attributed the successful completion of the sequence, including the couch shot, to director Guillermo Navarro. Colter also called the fourth episode particularly difficult to film, taking around 12 or 13 days to shoot. The episode was written by executive producer Charles Murray, [...] "a geek bar none" [...] who looked to organically transition the character's origin story from the original comics into the modern world of the series for the episode. This involved flashback sequences with Colter in makeup and different costumes, and each scene was shot by director Vincenzo Natali in many camera setups.|$|E
