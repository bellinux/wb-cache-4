The Ladakhi Urial is another unique mountain sheep that inhabits the mountains of Ladakh. The population is declining, however, and there are not more than 3000 individuals left in Ladakh. The urial is endemic to Ladakh, where it is distributed only along two major river valleys: the Indus and Shayok. The animal is often persecuted by farmers whose crops are allegedly damaged by it. Its population declined precipitously in the last century due to indiscriminate shooting by hunters along the Leh-Srinagar highway. The <b>Tibetan</b> <b>argali</b> or Nyan is the largest wild sheep in the world, standing 3.5 to 4 feet at the shoulder with the horn measuring 90–100cm. It is distributed on the Tibetan plateau and its marginal mountains encompassing a total area of 2.5 million km2. There is only a small population of about 400 animals in Ladakh. The animal prefers open and rolling terrain as it runs, unlike wild goats that climb into steep cliffs, to escape from predators. The endangered Tibetan antelope, known as chiru in Indian English, or Ladakhi tsos, has traditionally been hunted for its wool (shahtoosh) which is a natural fiber of the finest quality and thus valued for its light weight and warmth and as a status symbol. The wool of chiru must be pulled out by hand, a process done after the animal is killed. The fiber is smuggled into Kashmir and woven into exquisite shawls by Kashmiri workers. Ladakh is also home to the Tibetan gazelle, which inhabits the vast rangelands in eastern Ladakh bordering Tibet.|$|E

This study conducted in the high altitude rangelands of Indian Transhimalaya, deals with basic questions regarding the ecology of an endangered species, the wildsheep <b>Tibetan</b> <b>argali</b> (Ovis ammon hodgsoni) and applied issues related to its conservation and potential conflict with the local nomadic pastoralists. The basic questions on ecology are aimed at delineating the habitat and resource selection processes, identifying factors causing sexual segregation and efficient surveying and sampling. The applied aspect focuses on {{the changing face of}} pastoralism and the potential impacts of modernising livestock husbandry on argali. Overall, the study provides a general framework towards the understanding of argali-habitat relationships at different spatio-temporal scales. The spatial determinant associated with altitude in the area, predicts argali habitat and resource selection in this relatively homogenous landscape. These determine the range of other topographic variables and forage characteristics selected by argali. The selection of feeding patches in the selected range of altitude and topography is mainly characterised by their greenness and the quality of plant groups. Adjusting to changing forage quality, argali display an opportunistic feeding strategy, selecting grasses in early spring and switching to forbs later in summer. Nevertheless, the habitat selection process did not appear to differ among the sexes to drive sexual segregation. There was, however, strong segregation among the sexes as well as between lactating and non lactating females. The reasons for segregation appeared to be predominantly social, but driven ultimately by predation and concomitantly by resources. The habitat selection information was used to design a stratified random sampling strategy that led to i) a significant reduction in survey effort in sampling these sparsely distributed species and ii) reduction in sampling bias. The applied aspect of the study outlines and evaluates the dramatic changes in the nomadic pastoralism that have occurred in the past five decades in the study area. These have led to a loss of pastures (- 25 to - 33 %) of the nomads, consequent readjustment in traditional patterns of pasture use, intensified grazing pressures (25 to 70 %) and rangeland degradation in the area. Such changes may have serious consequences on the survival of local wildlife, as tested with a study of the effects on argali of livestock presence and resource exploitation. Hence, a successful conservation and recovery strategy should focus on: minimising the impacts of livestock on argali, identifying the factors affecting the persistence of the current populations, increasing local sub populations of this species to prevent extinction due to stochastic events, prevent loss of genetic diversity and excessive fragmentation and thus ensuring gene flow. Ecological Niche Factor Analyses (ENFA), bias-reduced logistic regression and Fuzzy correspondence analyses (FCA) were used to answer habitat and resource selection questions. A sexual segregation and aggregation statistic (SSAS) was used to estimate the components of sexual segregation and test segregation. SSAS combined with canonical correspondence analyses (CCA) allowed the estimation of segregation based on habitat variables. Logistic regression models were formulated to estimate models on which the stratified random sampling strategy was based. The Animal - Habitat relationships in high altitude rangelands overall study also included surveys, interviews and literature reviews to understand the nomads’ movement and pasture use patterns of their livestock. Kernel density estimations (KDE) were used to estimate extent of range overlaps between livestock and argali...|$|E

We evaluated the influence of domestic sheep and goat grazing on the habitat use and time budget of the endangered <b>Tibetan</b> <b>argali</b> Ovis ammon hodgsoni in the proposed Gya-Miru Wildlife Sanctuary, Ladakh, India. We asked if the domestic sheep and goat grazing and collateral human activities relegate the argali to sub-optimal habitats, and alter their foraging time budgets. Data were collected on habitat use and time budget of a population of c. 50 argalis before and after c. 2, 000 sheep and goats moved onto their winter pasture in the Tsabra catchment of the aforementioned reserve. Following the introduction of domestic sheep and goats, argalis continued to use the same catchment but shifted to steeper habitats, closer to cliffs, with lower vegetation cover, thus abandoning previously used plant communities with denser cover. Argalis¿ active time spent foraging also decreased by 10 % in response to the presence of livestock. These results suggest a clear disturbance effect of livestock on argalis, and indicate a potential for competition, conceivably a significant disadvantage for argalis in winter when forage availability is minimal...|$|E
40|$|The Near Threatened <b>Tibetan</b> <b>argali</b> Ovis ammon hodgsoni is {{distributed}} across the Tibetan Plateau and its peripheral mountains. Within India {{it occurs in}} Ladakh (Jammu and Kashmir) and Sikkim, and the population {{was estimated to be}} c. 200 in the early 1990 s. Hunting of the species was banned in Jammu and Kashmir in the 1980 s but the effect of this hunting moratorium on the population has not previously been assessed. We conducted surveys in the proposed Gya-Miru Wildlife Sanctuary and the neighbouring Tsokar Basin, areas reported to have a relatively high abundance of argali within Ladakh. We also opportunistically surveyed other areas and collected secondary information about the species¿ occurrence in other parts of Ladakh. A total of 127 animals were counted during the surveys. Based on this number and other small populations reported earlier by us and others, we estimate a total population of 300 ¿ 360 argali in Ladakh. Although past population estimates were approximate, the present estimate, which includes areas not previously surveyed, suggests there has been no substantial change in the population of argali in Ladakh since the early 1980 s. Factors other than hunting therefore appear to be impeding argali population recovery in this region. Pashmina-producing goats are the most abundant livestock within the argali's range and, owing to the recent increase in demand for this fibre, the goat population is increasing and this may be hindering the recovery of the argal...|$|E
40|$|In 1993 the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) of China {{established}} the 300 000 km 2 Chang Tang Nature Preserve on the northwestern Tibetan plateau, an action precipitated by rapidly diminishing populations of chiru (Tibetan antelope) and wild yak. Some 30 000 nomadic pastoralists use areas within this reserve for livestock grazing, with many having traditionally depended {{in part on}} hunting for supplementary subsistence and trade. Following a 1997 request from TAR leaders for international assistance in addressing the conservation issues associated {{with the creation of}} this reserve, the TAR Forestry Bureau and the Network for University Co-operation Tibet – Norway began a 3 -year research collaboration program in 2000 to outline human-wildlife interactions and conservation priorities {{in the western part of}} the reserve. To date, four excursions (2 - 6 weeks each) have been made to the western Chang Tang region, and investigations of interactions between pastoralists and wildlife conservation objectives have been initiated in an area of about 5000 km 2, including the 2300 km 2 Aru basin located at 5000 m elevation at the northern edge of pastoralist inhabitation. The Aru site is unique in that nomads have only recently returned to this previously off-limits basin. But, as in surrounding areas, the people’s lives are undergoing changes recently influenced by the introduction of permanent winter houses, changing international trade in shahtoosh and cashmere wool, and a move towards stricter hunting regulations. The northwestern Chang Tang, with the Aru basin as a prime site, represents one of the last strongholds of the endangered chiru and wild yak, as well as home to Tibetan gazelle, kiang, <b>Tibetan</b> <b>argali,</b> blue sheep, wolf, snow leopard and brown bear. In autumn 2000, for example, with approximately 12 000 of the wild ungulates (mostly the migratory chiru) within the Aru basin along with some 8000 domestic livestock, issues of land use overlap and possible grazing competition are clear to both local nomads and reserve managers. Whereas livestock development actions elsewhere on the Tibetan plateau are promoting increased livestock production, they are doing so at the expense of wildlife, and such an approach will not be appropriate in areas where wildlife conservation is a major priority. Although some of the ongoing livestock development programs may be adapted to the western TAR, new approaches to pastoral development will have to be developed in the reserve. The ultimate goal of enhancing the nomads’ standard of living, while conserving this truly unique array of biodiversity, presents a daunting challenge...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Tibetan</b> <b>Argali</b> (Ovis ammon hodgsoni), a {{wild sheep}} of the {{subfamily}} Caprinae (Bovidae), primarily {{found in the}} Tibetan Plateau, is categorized as near threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. For the conservation of this species, we have achieved the cloning of a full-term live Argali lamb (died shortly after birth) from a male Argali cell line that has been cryopreserved for more than 20 years. While working towards the goal of cloning a live Argali, we also recognised the need to establish a reproductive herd of animals by producing both fertile males and females. However, {{as in the case}} of Argali, it is difficult, and in some cases impossible, to obtain male and female cell lines from an endangered mammalian species. Therefore, for demonstrating a proof of concept of using an assisted reproduction technology (ART) for the conservation of endangered species or reviving extinct species, we used the Argali as an experimental model to produce both fertile males and females through ART. The Sry gene plays a central role in mammalian sex determination: mutations in the Sry gene result in the development of XY females; in mice, Sry knockout (KO) results in fertile XY females. Therefore, we created sex-reversed Argali cell lines through the KO of the Sry gene. In parallel, for potentially comparing the fertility of sex-reversed XY females between the Argali and domestic sheep [Romney (Ovis aries) ], we also knocked out the Sry gene in the domestic sheep. Specifically, we used the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) /Cas system to introduce mutations to the high-mobility group (HMG) box of the Sry gene. Skin fibroblasts from either adult Argali or Romney sheep were cultured in DMEM (HyClone) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were harvested at 100 % confluence with 0. 25 % trypsin-EDTA and transfected with the CRISPR/Cas DNA constructs by using the Amaxa Nucleofector system. For each experiment, 106 cells were transfected with 5 μg of CRISPR/Cas DNA constructs. After 72 hours post-transfection, cells were harvested, with half being used for genomic DNA isolation (for examining KO efficiency) and the other half for limited dilution for obtaining single-cell-derived colonies. With the Surveyor assay and a restriction enzyme digestion assay (successfully knocked-out cells lose the Dde I site in the HMG box of the Sry gene, rendering resistance to Dde I digestion), we demonstrated that the Sry KO efficiency was about 10 % both in Argali and Romney sheep. By screening single-cell-derived colonies from the transfected Romney sheep cells, an Sry-KO cell line harboring a 2 -nucleotide deletion in the HMG box was successfully established. Multiple vials of cells from this Sry-KO cell line have been cryopreserved and will be used for animal cloning via somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) in the sheep-breeding season this fall...|$|E
