The classical Wimshurst machine, that became the most popular form of influence machine, was reported to the scientific community by 1883, although previous machines with very similar structures were previously described by Holtz and Musaeus. [...] In 1885, one of the largest-ever Wimshurst machines was built in England (it {{is now at the}} Chicago Museum of Science and Industry). The Wimshurst machine is a considerably simple machine; it works, as all influence machines, with electrostatic induction of charges, which means that it uses even the slightest existing charge to create and accumulate more charges, and repeats this process {{for as long as the}} machine is in action. Wimshurst machines are composed of: two insulated disks attached to pulleys of opposite rotation, the disks have small conductive (usually metal) plates on their outward-facing sides; two double-ended brushes that serve as charge stabilizers and are also the place where induction happens, creating the new charges to be collected; two pairs of collecting combs, which are, as the name implies, the collectors of electrical charge produced by the machine; two Leyden Jars, the capacitors of the machine; a pair of electrodes, for the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> once they have been sufficiently accumulated. The simple structure and components of the Wimshurst Machine make it a common choice for a homemade electrostatic experiment or demonstration, these characteristics were factors that contributed to its popularity, as previously mentioned.|$|E

This can be observed from the red and blue areas that exist only at graphene matrix in atomic model, corresponding to energy levels of LUMO, LUMO + 1 and HOMO, while disappear in other energy levels in the graphene matrix. Due to the proper distribution of the LUMO and LUMO + 1 all over the heterostructure provided by the graphene layer, it allows the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> during the excitation states of S 3, S 4 and S 5 with energy barrier less than 4  eV.

Consequently, the charge and hole recombination rate is expected to be enhanced.|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the dynamics of hot charge carriers in InP nanowire ensembles containing a range of densities of zinc-blende inclusions along the otherwise wurtzite nanowires. From time-dependent photoluminescence spectra, we extract {{the temperature of the}} charge carriers as a function of time after nonresonant excitation. We find that charge-carrier temperature initially decreases rapidly with time in accordance with efficient heat transfer to lattice vibrations. However, cooling rates are subsequently slowed and are significantly lower for nanowires containing a higher density of stacking faults. We conclude that the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> across the type II interface is followed by release of additional energy to the lattice, which raises the phonon bath temperature above equilibrium and impedes the carrier cooling occurring through interaction with such phonons.

Due to the nonlinearity of the Josephson junction, tunneling Cooper pairs can create {{a great variety of}} non-classical states of light even at weak driving.

It is shown that static and dynamical charges are not driven by the same underlying parameters. A unified treatment of dynamical charges in periodic solids and large clusters is proposed. The origin of the difference between static and dynamical charges is discussed in terms of local polarizability and delocalized transfers of charge: local models succeed in reproducing anomalous effective charges thanks to large atomic polarizabilities but, in ABO(3) compounds, ab initio calculations favor the physical picture based upon <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>charges.</b> Various results concerning barium and strontium titanates are presented.

25|$|Applying {{a voltage}} to an {{electrochemical}} capacitor causes both electrodes in the capacitor to generate electrical double-layers. These double-layers consist of {{two layers of}} charges: one electronic layer is in the surface lattice structure of the electrode, and the other, with opposite polarity, emerges from dissolved and solvated ions in the electrolyte. The two layers are separated by a monolayer of solvent molecules, e. g. for water as solvent by water molecules, called inner Helmholtz plane (IHP). Solvent molecules adhere by physical adsorption {{on the surface of}} the electrode and separate the oppositely polarized ions from each other, and can be idealised as a molecular dielectric. In the process, there is no <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> between electrode and electrolyte, so the forces that cause the adhesion are not chemical bonds but physical forces (e.g. electrostatic forces).

Photoelectrochemical devices use light-absorbers, such as semiconductors, to capture sunlight and generate excited states of charge carriers that are transported to catalysts {{for the production}} of solar fuels.
