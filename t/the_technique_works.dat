2500|$|Direct free-kicks are a {{key part}} of attacking in football, and can lead to many goals. Numerous feints and ruses are tried to fool the opposition, {{including}} having attackers join the [...] "wall." [...] A successful free kick from the 1970 World Cup- Brazil vs Czechoslovakia, illustrates how <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> <b>works.</b> Brazilian forwards Jairzinho and Tostao cunningly joined the end of the defensive wall as the Czechs set it up. As Pele backed off and feinted as if to take the kick, both Jair and Tostão began to move off, creating space. Roberto Rivelino ghosted in from the side to shoot powerfully into the gap for a goal.|$|E

50|$|Solid {{solution}} strengthening {{is a type}} of alloying {{that can}} be used to improve the strength of a pure metal. <b>The</b> <b>technique</b> <b>works</b> by adding atoms of one element (the alloying element) to the crystalline lattice of another element (the base metal), forming a solid solution. The local nonuniformity in the lattice due to the alloying element makes plastic deformation more difficult by impeding dislocation motion. In contrast, alloying beyond the solubility limit can form a second phase, leading to strengthening via other mechanisms (e.g. the precipitation of intermetallic compounds).|$|E
50|$|A {{signal delay}} is {{produced}} which grows or decays exponentially with time, justas the atmospheric density is an exponential function of height above theEarth's surface. In fact, this so-called limb sounding technique allowsus {{to determine the}} scale height, the constant describing the steepness ofthis atmospheric density decay. This makes the technique extremely valuable forclimatological studies, as the scale height {{is directly related to}} thetemperature in the upper atmosphere, where the limb sounding signals do theirsensing. <b>The</b> <b>technique</b> <b>works</b> best in the lower stratosphere and uppertroposphere; it breaks down close to the Earth surface especially in thetropics, due to water vapour extinction.|$|E
50|$|Consider {{a system}} which has 3 {{parameters}} {{and each of them}} has 3 values. To test all the possible combinations of these parameters (i.e. exhaustive testing) we will need a set of 3^3 = 27 test cases. But instead of testing the system for each combination of parameters, we can use an orthogonal array to select only a subset of these combinations. Using orthogonal array testing, we can maximize the test coverage while minimizing the number of test cases to consider. We here assume that the pair that maximizes interaction between the parameters will have more defects and that <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> <b>works.</b>|$|E
