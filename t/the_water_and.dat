5|$|Although toads {{are usually}} solitary animals, in the {{breeding}} season, {{large numbers of}} toads converge on certain breeding ponds, where the males compete to mate with the females. Eggs are laid in gelatinous strings in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> later hatch out into tadpoles. After several months of growth and development, these sprout limbs and undergo metamorphosis into tiny toads. The juveniles emerge from <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> remain largely terrestrial {{for the rest of}} their lives.|$|E

40|$|This study {{assessed}} the heavy metals total copper, total lead, and total zinc in <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>and</b> soils of Calancan Bay, Marinduque Island, Philippines. Heavy metal monitoring in <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>and</b> soils {{was carried out}} in November 2009. Results showed that the heavy metals in <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>and</b> soils were evident at high concentrations even after 13 years of non-operation of mining activities in the island. Higher total copper concentrations in the soils along the causeway of Calancan Bay and reduced total copper concentrations going to the eastern side of Calancan Bay were observed. Significant differences in the total zinc in <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>and</b> total zinc, total lead, and total copper in the soils (P  0. 05) were noted between Calancan Bay and a control waterway far from the mining site. Continuous heavy metal monitoring is encouraged to safeguard the risk and impact of heavy metals, particularly from mining wastes, in the general environment and on {{the quality of life of}} the general public...|$|R

The existing production capacity of WASA is , almost {{all of which is}} drawn from wells located in the old beds of the Chenab River. From the wells, water is pumped to a terminal reservoir located on Sargodha Road. Water is normally supplied for a total of about 8 hours per day to the majority of the city.

5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle is an {{opportunistic}} carnivore and consumes a {{wide variety}} of animal prey, including carrion. It often catches a fish by flying low over <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> grasping it in its talons. It prepares for the strike by holding its feet far forward (almost under its chin) and then strikes backwards while simultaneously beating its wings to lift upwards. Generally only one foot is used to seize prey. The white-bellied sea eagle may also dive at a 45 degree angle from its perch and briefly submerge to catch fish near the water surface. While hunting over water on sunny days, it often flies directly into the sun or at right angles to it, seemingly to avoid casting shadows over <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> hence alerting potential prey.|$|E
5|$|A diving stage, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the basket, or diver launch and recovery system (LARS), is a platform on which one or two divers stand which is hoisted into the water, lowered to the workplace or the bottom, and then hoisted up again to return the diver {{to the surface and}} lift him out of the water. This equipment is almost exclusively used by surface supplied professional divers, as it requires fairly complex lifting equipment. A diving stage allows the surface team to conveniently manage a diver's decompression as it can be hoisted at a controlled rate and stopped at the correct depth for decompression stops, and allows the divers to rest during the ascent. It also allows the divers to be relatively safely and conveniently lifted out of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> returned to the deck or quayside.|$|E
