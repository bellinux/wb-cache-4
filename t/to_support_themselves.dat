5|$|Like other conduct {{books of}} the time, Thoughts adapts older genres to the new middle-class ethos. The book {{encourages}} mothers to teach their daughters analytical thinking, self-discipline, honesty, contentment in their social position, and marketable skills (in case they should ever need <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>themselves).</b> These goals reveal Wollstonecraft's intellectual debt to John Locke; however, the prominence she affords religious faith and innate feeling distinguishes her work from his. Her aim is to educate women to be useful wives and mothers, because, she argues, it is through these roles that they can most effectively contribute to society. The predominantly domestic role Wollstonecraft outlines for womena role that she viewed as meaningfulwas interpreted by 20th-century feminist literary critics as paradoxically confining them to the private sphere.|$|E

25|$|For those Japanese Canadians {{living in}} the {{internment}} camps, the forced sale of their properties meant they now had less cash and resources. They were not receiving any rental income from their properties, and the Custodian of Enemy Property {{took control of the}} funds resulting from property sales. The Custodian did not provide interest on the funds, and restricted withdrawals from the funds held in their possession. What funds Japanese Canadians were able to receive went <b>to</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>themselves</b> and their families in the camps, often helping those who could not work or were not able to live off of the inadequate government subsidies. As a result, many families and single men began leaving BC in search of employment elsewhere.|$|R

5|$|Many {{women are}} {{convinced}} that their husbands are putting their lives at risk by engaging in extramarital sexual relations without using protection; however, because of their secondary status, they are often unwilling to initiate discussions about HIV/AIDS in the home. Most women in Malawi do not view divorce as a viable option, even when their husbands are HIV-positive and refuse {{to protect them from}} the virus by wearing condoms during marital intercourse. Because they lack the education and training needed to seek gainful employment, women are not usually able <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>themselves</b> and their children outside of marriage without resorting to commercial sex work for money.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{orphaned}} children in Malawi {{has increased dramatically}} since the HIV/AIDS epidemic began in 1985, with certain surveys indicating that more than 35% of schoolchildren have experienced the death {{of at least one}} parent due to HIV/AIDS. Because HIV is transmitted sexually, married couples who engage in unprotected sexual relations put their children at increased risk of becoming double orphans, or children who have lost both parents to HIV/AIDS. Older children who have lost both parents to HIV/AIDS often become responsible for the care of their younger siblings, and many double orphans drop out of school or migrate to urban areas to try <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>themselves</b> and their siblings. Girls who have been orphaned by HIV/AIDS have unusually high rates of school absenteeism in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|A devout Buddhist from youth, {{once her}} {{children}} {{had grown up}} Ho decided to serve the Buddhist cause, and to dedicate {{the rest of her}} life to caring for others. In 1958, she became a Buddhist nun at the age of 50. In 1969, aged 61, Ho bought a two-storey detached house in Richards Avenue with her savings, and turned it into the Man Fut Tong Old Peoples' Home for aged sick and single elderly women. Most of the 20 or so residents had neither enough earnings <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>themselves</b> nor any relatives to turn to. To raise additional funds for the home, she cultivated and sold prize-winning white orchids at Tanglin, and vegetarian food at Kong Meng San Temple in Bishan. She cleaned, cooked, took her charges to the doctors, helped them to collect their social benefits and even sometimes saw to their last rites.|$|E
50|$|Cultural and {{institutional}} issues {{are a problem}} for intellectual disability sportspeople in Cameroon. Unlike people with physical disabilities, many ID sportspeople {{do not have access}} to appropriate education that specifically addresses their needs. They end up penalized because society provides no means to allow them <b>to</b> adequately <b>support</b> <b>themselves.</b> FECASD is trying to change these attitudes some by doing outreach to people with intellectual disabilities using sports as a vehicle to better their lives.|$|R

5|$|Although the Giants played well, {{the team}} {{experienced}} financial hardship {{during its first}} year. Player salaries were so low that most had to take additional jobs <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>themselves.</b> The team's brief practices, held at 4:30 p. m. each day to accommodate outside-work schedules, enabled little in-season improvement. Overshadowed by baseball, boxing and college football, professional football was not a popular sport in 1925 and owner Tim Mara spent $25,000 {{of his own money}} during the season to keep the team going. The financial struggle continued until the 11th game of the season, when the visiting Red Grange and the Chicago Bears drew more than 73,000 fans (a pro-football record) and an additional 20,000 were turned away. This gave the Giants much-needed revenue, possibly altering the team's history. In the 19–7 Bears victory, Grange intercepted a pass intended for Bomar and returned it for a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|CARE International proposes several {{strategies}} that might reduce the destructive {{economic impact of}} HIV/AIDS on rural households. They recommend introducing new technologies that improve productivity to allow households affected by HIV/AIDS to continue supporting themselves through agriculture. Women in patrilineal/patrilocal villages are often unable <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>themselves</b> and their children when their husbands die of HIV/AIDS; therefore, helping women acquire traditionally masculine agricultural skills might decrease their vulnerability while improving agricultural productivity at the household and community levels. CARE International recommends increasing cooperation at the community level by establishing labor and food banks in areas that have been devastated by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Finally, CARE International {{highlights the importance of}} increasing access to information about HIV/AIDS in Malawi to help families prepare for and cope with the economic burdens associated with the epidemic.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Fraser {{returned}} to Toronto {{and took up}} her research post, simultaneously working as a demonstrator with the Department of Hygiene and Preventative Medicine. She {{was one of the}} founding faculty of the School of Hygiene at U of T. She made her home with her brother Donald; Williams, who had also returned from England, moved in with her own mother. Though the two women wanted to live together, raise children and continue their careers, they were unwilling to displease or fail in their obligations to their mothers. They also realized that though they were middle-class, working women, economic inequalities in their pay compromised their ability <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>themselves</b> and their need to remain in the good graces of their families for support. When Williams was bequeathed a farm near Aurora, Ontario, the couple believed it might become their haven, but when Williams applied for courses at the Ontario School of Agriculture, she was advised the courses were full. For the next several years, they lived apart but within a 30-minute walk from each other at various residences.|$|E

50|$|Charles {{had never}} {{forgotten}} how {{his mother had}} struggled in poverty to keep her family together after her husband had died. There were few resources in the 19th and early 20th century to help either widows or orphans. He knew first-hand how fatherless children often had to forgo a school education <b>to</b> help <b>support</b> <b>themselves</b> or their families by working full-time in menial jobs. Now that Charles had begun to prosper, he thought about how he could help others caught in the same situation. He envisioned creating a planned community where widows and orphans could live and become more productive members of society.|$|R
5|$|William and Jim Anderson soon {{formed a}} gang {{with a man}} named Bill Reed; in February 1863, the Lexington Weekly Union {{recorded}} that Reed {{was the leader of}} the gang. In his 2003 history of Civil War Missouri, Bruce Nichols stated that Reed led the gang until mid-July of that year. William Quantrill, a Confederate guerrilla leader, later claimed to have encountered them in July and rebuked them for robbing Confederate sympathizers; in their biography of Anderson, Albert Castel and Tom Goodrich speculate that this rebuke may have resulted in a deep resentment of Quantrill by Anderson. Anderson and his gang subsequently traveled east of Jackson County, Missouri, avoiding territory where Quantrill operated and continuing <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>themselves</b> by robbery. They also attacked Union soldiers, killing seven by early 1863.|$|E
5|$|After {{the second}} Anglo-Maratha war, Shinde and Holkar had lost {{many of their}} territories to the British. They {{encouraged}} the Pindaris to raid the British territories. The Pindaris, who were mostly cavalry, {{came to be known}} as the Shindeshahi and the Holkarshahi after the patronage they received from the respective defeated Maratha leaders. The Pindari leaders were Setu, Karim Khan, Dost Mohammad, Tulsi, Imam Baksh, Sahib Khan, Kadir Baksh, Nathu, and Bapu. Of these, Setu, Karim Khan, and Dost Mohammad belonged to Shindeshahi and the rest to Holkarshahi. The total strength of the Pindaris in 1814 was estimated at 33,000. The Pindaris frequently raided villages in Central India. The result of the Pindari raids was that Central India was being rapidly reduced to the condition of a desert because the peasants were unable <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>themselves</b> on the land. They had no option but to join the robber bands or starve. In 1815, 25,000 Pindaris entered the Madras Presidency and destroyed over 300 villages on the Coromandel coast. Another band swept the Nizam's kingdom while a third entered Malabar. Other Pindari raids on British territory followed in 1816 and 1817. Francis Rawdon-Hastings saw that there could not be peace or security in India until the predatory Pindaris were extinguished.|$|E
5|$|From {{the mid-nineteenth}} century {{portrait}} painting declined as an art. This was {{partly due to the}} advent of photography, which could record the human face with greater ease. While grander commissions were still made, the miniature in particular, which had often been in an intimate locket or brooch, was largely replaced. David Octavius Hill (1802–70) originally took an interest in photography as a means of being able to record the figures of Great Disruption of 1843 for a composite painted portrait, but as part of Hill & Adamson {{he was one of the}} founding fathers of art photography. Just as portrait photography inherited many of the conventions of painting, photography also began to influence painting. From the 1840s John Watson Gordon's work began to be influenced by early photography, with cool light and muted colours, as can be seen in his full-length portrait of Principal Lee (1847). Major figures who worked in portraiture and came to prominence in the second half of the century included Francis Grant, who became the first Scottish president of the Royal Academy in London, Robert Scott Lauder (1803–69), William Quiller Orchardson (1832–1910) and John Pettie (1839–93). John Zephaniah Bell (1794–1883) was educated in London and was a forerunner of the trend of Parisian education that would become common among Scottish artists from the later nineteenth century. The most significant grouping in late nineteenth-century Scotland, the Glasgow Boys, mainly focused on landscape. They were influenced by the leading continental artists of the day and broke with Victorian convention. A number of artists identified with the group came <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>themselves</b> through portrait painting, including James Guthrie (1859–1930) and Belfast-born John Lavery (1856–1944).|$|E

The size varies widely, some are printed in broadsheet format, some in tabloid format, and some in magazine-sized format.

5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Kansas Anderson {{continued}} horse trafficking, but ranchers in the area soon became aware of his operations. In May 1862 Baker issued an arrest warrant for Griffith, whom Anderson helped hide. Some local citizens suspected that the Anderson family was assisting Griffith and traveled to their house to confront William C. Anderson. After hearing their accusations against his sons, he was incensed—he found Baker's involvement particularly infuriating. The next day he traveled to the Council Grove courthouse with a gun, intending to force Baker to withdraw the warrant. As he entered the building he was restrained by a constable and fatally shot by Baker. William Anderson buried his father, and was subsequently arrested for assisting Griffith. However, he was quickly released owing to {{a problem with the}} warrant, and fled to Agnes City, fearing that he would be lynched. There he met Baker, who temporarily placated him by providing a lawyer. Anderson remained in Agnes City until he learned that Baker would not be charged, as the judge's claim of self-defense had been accepted by legal authorities. Anderson was outraged and went to Missouri with his siblings. William and Jim Anderson then traveled southwest of Kansas City, robbing travelers <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|E
