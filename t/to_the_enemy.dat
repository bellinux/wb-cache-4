5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the war, her encounters with the enemy were infrequent. In fact, her next submarine contact did not occur until 17December and, like those before, resulted in no definite damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> Although the opening months of 1918 brought no new U-boat contacts, Wadsworth worked hard escorting convoys and patrolling British waters.|$|E
5|$|The Jisr ed Damieh bridge, which {{carried the}} Wadi Fara road from Nablus across the Jordan River, was {{captured}} on 22 September by Meldrum's Force, comprising the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade and 1st and 2nd Battalions, British West Indies Regiment, supported by artillery. All fords south of this bridge were also denied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dazzle {{was adopted}} by the Admiralty in the UK, and then by the United States Navy, with little evaluation. Each ship's dazzle pattern was unique to avoid making classes of ships {{instantly}} recognisable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> The result was that a profusion of dazzle schemes was tried, and the evidence for their success was at best mixed. So many factors were involved {{that it was impossible to}} determine which were important, and whether any of the colour schemes were effective.|$|E

5|$|Early in March 1918, she {{received}} a change in assignment. On the 4th, she arrived in Brest, France, whence she operated {{for the remainder of}} the war. During that assignment, she recorded only two scrapes with German submarines: the first on 1June and the second on 25October. In each case, she dropped depth charges, but could produce no solid proof of damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> The war ended on 11November 1918 when Germany accepted Allied armistice terms.|$|E
5|$|Gyromancer is {{a puzzle}} and {{role-playing}} video game developed by PopCap Games {{in collaboration with}} Square Enix. In the game, the player moves through a map of an enchanted forest, battling monsters using their own summoned monsters through a puzzle-game battle based on PopCap's Bejeweled Twist. In these battles, the player rotates groups of four in a grid of gems to line up three or more jewels of the same color; when enough lines have been created damage is dealt <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> Between battles, a story is told {{through a series of}} cutscenes, while the player and the summoned monsters gain experience and power using role-playing game elements.|$|E
5|$|Rapid forces, {{whether for}} an {{offensive}} or defensive purpose, {{were needed to}} deny vital locations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> Long before the Germans did, the French had contemplated using airborne troops to achieve speedy attacks. As early as 1936 the French had commissioned the design of light airborne tanks, but these plans had been abandoned in 1940, as they possessed no cargo planes large enough to carry them. A naval division and an infantry division were earmarked to depart for Zealand to block the Western Scheldt against a German crossing. These would send forward forces over the Scheldt estuary into the Isles, supplied by overseas shipping.|$|E

5|$|Strategic {{deception}} included increasing {{military activity}} far away, near Moscow. At {{the sites of}} the planned attack, elaborate disinformation was fed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> Defence lines were built to deceive German tactical reconnaissance. Civilians within 25 kilometres of the front were evacuated, and trenches were dug around the villages for Luftwaffe reconnaissance to see. Conversely, along the uninvolved Voronezh Front, bridging equipment and boats were prepared to suggest an offensive there. The five real bridges that were built for the attack were masked by the construction of seventeen false bridges over the River Don.|$|E
5|$|The {{radio station}} played {{a vital role}} during the Second World War in {{maintaining}} communications with the British merchant navy and with patrol aircraft in the North Atlantic. During the war, all communications with ships were one-way {{in order to avoid}} revealing the ships' locations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> The station was short-staffed because many were on secondments to various government services, such as operating other radio stations and training new radio officers to work in naval convoys. In 1943, the workload was so great that a Royal Navy officer and 18 telegraphists were brought in from HMS Flowerdown, a Naval Shore Wireless Service station near Winchester.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of {{perceived}} provocations from Prussia, culminating in the offer of the Spanish crown to the Prussian Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern, the French emperor Napoleon III declared war on 15 July 1870. Initially, this step was supported by an outbreak of patriotic fervour and confident expectations of victory. Bizet, along with other composers and artists, joined the National Guard and began training. He was critical of the antiquated equipment with which {{he was supposed to}} fight; his unit's guns, he said, were more dangerous to themselves than <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> The national mood was soon depressed by news of successive reverses; at Sedan on 2 September, the French armies suffered an overwhelming defeat; Napoleon was captured and deposed, and the Second Empire came to a sudden end.|$|E

5|$|Although Curtis was {{personally}} opposed to British possession of Gibraltar, he took command of a marine unit during the siege, {{and in the}} attack by Spanish gunboats and floating batteries in September 1782, Curtis took his men into the harbour in small boats to engage the enemy. During this operation, Curtis witnessed {{the destruction of the}} batteries by British fireships and was able to rescue hundreds of burnt and drowning Spanish sailors from the water. This rescue effort was carried out in close proximity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> force and in constant danger from the detonation of burning Spanish ships, which showered his overcrowded boats with debris and caused several casualties amongst his crews. When Lord Howe relieved the siege, he brought the much-celebrated Curtis back to Britain, where he was knighted for his service and became a society figure, featuring in many newspaper prints. He came under attack however from Lieutenant Campbell, who published a pamphlet accusing him of indecision and a lack of nerve during his time in Brilliant.|$|E
5|$|Each {{character}} can use {{one type of}} weapon, in addition to magical spells. The effectiveness of spells depends on the magical ability of the character and the element of the spell in relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> When in battle mode, attacking monsters fills a gauge that allows the player to use character-specific special attacks. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, each {{character can}} increase in level to gain improved character statistics such as strength and evasion. Options such as changing equipment, casting spells, or checking status are performed by cycling through the game's Ring Commands—a circular menu which hovers over the controlled party member. The game is paused whenever the Ring Command menu is activated. Within the Ring, the player has nine slots for storing items; additional items can be placed into item storage, which is inaccessible in combat.|$|E
5|$|Each enemy has a meter, {{called a}} Chain Gauge, {{consisting}} of a percentage that increases from a base level of 100 when the enemy is struck by attacks or spells. Different attacks have different effects; some raise the chain by a larger amount while others give the player longer before the Chain Gauge resets to 100 percent. The amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by the chain percentage before it is applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> When the chain counter reaches a preset amount, different for each enemy, the enemy becomes Staggered. In this mode, the enemy has lowered defense and is easily interrupted, and some may even be launched into the air, preventing them from attacking and stopping their ATB gauges from replenishing.|$|E

5|$|Hardboiled had no {{specific}} {{goal for the}} Allies, other than to convince the Germans of an imminent invasion threat against Norway. Clarke had already established that deception operations should have {{a clear idea of}} what the enemy was supposed to do (rather than what they were expected to think). Stanley was unaware of this, not being in communication with Clarke's department in Cairo. As a result, the objective for Hardboiled was chosen because the resources existed and it would not affect real future operations (planners had already rejected Norway as a viable target), rather than for any strategic advantage it brought the Allies. Stanley was also unaware of the extensive double agent network {{under the control of the}} Twenty Committee, having merely been told that MI5 had an avenue through which to pass information <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1768, {{a treaty}} was {{negotiated}} between {{several of the}} British colonies and the Iroquois. The Iroquois sold their territorial claims to the colonies {{as part of the}} treaty. The company created to hold that claim was named the Indiana Land Company, the first recorded use of the word Indiana. The claim was disputed by the colony of Virginia, which did not participate in the treaty because it already laid claim to the land through its royal charter. In 1773, the territory of Indiana was brought under the administration of Province of Quebec to appease its French population. The Quebec Act was listed as one of the Intolerable Acts the Thirteen Colonies cited as a reason for the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. The thirteen colonies thought themselves entitled to the territory for their support of Great Britain during the French and Indian War, and were incensed that it was given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> the colonies had been fighting.|$|E
5|$|In {{the field}} map, players may engage the enemy {{as soon as}} they enter Battle Mode, which uses a pausable {{real-time}} combat system, much like Square's Parasite Eve (1998). In Battle Mode, when the player taps the attack button, a spherical grid appears around Ashley. Individual body parts within this sphere can be targeted. The battle system involves the player chaining different attacks known as Chain Abilities to achieve large combos and deal damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> This is done by pressing buttons in timely succession, making combat resemble a rhythm game. In addition to Chain Abilities, Defensive Abilities allow Ashley to reduce or reflect damage or avoid status ailments. Ashley also gains Break Arts, which exchange his hit points (HP) for increased damage.|$|E

5000|$|The {{principle}} of Jū is incomplete {{at this point}} because yielding is essentially only a neutralization of <b>the</b> <b>enemy's</b> force. While giving way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy's</b> force of attack there must instantly be applied an action that takes advantage of <b>the</b> <b>enemy,</b> now occupied with his attack, {{in the form of}} a counterattack.This second aspect of the {{principle of}} Jū makes allowance for situations in which yielding is impossible because it would lead to disaster. In such cases [...] "resistance" [...] is justified. But such opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy's</b> actions is only momentary and is quickly followed by an action based on the first aspect of Jū, that of yielding.|$|R
5|$|On 13 September, {{a platoon}} of the 2/25th Infantry Battalion came under very heavy fire from a {{concealed}} Japanese machine gun near Heath's Plantation that wounded a number of Australians, including Corporal W. H. (Billy) Richards, and halted the platoon's advance. Private Richard Kelliher suddenly, on his own initiative, dashed toward the post and hurled two grenades at it, which killed some of the Japanese defenders but not all. He returned to his section, seized a Bren gun, dashed back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> post and silenced it. He then asked permission to go out again to rescue the wounded Richards, which he accomplished successfully under heavy fire from another enemy position. Kelliher was awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|On 3 November, a {{batch of}} three {{companies}} was deployed to the Badgam area on patrol duties. Their objective was to check the infiltrators moving toward Srinagar from the north. As there was no enemy movement, {{two of the three}} deployed companies returned to Srinagar at 2:00pm. However, Sharma's D Company, was ordered to stay in position until 3:00pm. At 2:35pm, Sharma's company was fired upon from the local resident houses in Badgam but counter-fire was not ordered to avoid injuring or killing innocent civilians. Suddenly, a tribal lashkar (English: militiamen) of 700 infiltrators approached Badgam from the direction of Gulmarg. D Company was soon surrounded from three sides and sustained heavy casualties from mortar fire. Sharma realized the importance of holding onto his position as both the city of Srinagar and the airport would be vulnerable if lost. Under heavy fire, and outnumbered by a ratio of seven to one, he urged his company to fight bravely, often exposing himself <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> fire as he ran from one post to the other.|$|E
5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Cairo, Clarke began to build a network of useful contacts. He befriended Lieutenant-Colonel Raymund Maunsell, who {{operated}} Security Intelligence Middle East (SIME), the agency in charge of counter-espionage in the region. Maunsell later worked closely with Clarke, helping to feed misinformation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> via double agents. Clarke's first deception was a scheme to mislead Italian forces into expecting an invasion of Italian Somaliland instead of Eritrea, the real Allied target. Operation Camilla fooled the Italian leadership completely but instead of diverting troops as the British hoped, they withdrew their forces into Eritrea. From this failure Clarke learned a first lesson, one he would teach to many other deception officers during the war: {{that the key to}} deception was not to make your enemy think what you wish but to get them to do what you want.|$|E
25|$|Tactically, {{the guerrilla}} army would avoid any {{confrontation}} with large units of enemy troops, but seek and eliminate {{small groups of}} soldiers to minimize losses and exhaust the opposing force. Not limiting their targets to personnel, enemy resources are also preferred targets. All of that is <b>to</b> weaken <b>the</b> <b>enemy's</b> strength, <b>to</b> cause <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> eventually <b>to</b> be unable <b>to</b> persue <b>the</b> war any longer, and <b>to</b> force <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>to</b> withdraw.|$|R
