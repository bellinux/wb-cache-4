50|$|Continuous {{daylight}} autonomy, {{is similar}} to daylight autonomy but partial credit is attributed to time steps when the daylight illuminance lies below the minimum illuminance level. For example, if the target illuminance is 400 lux and the calculated value is 200 lux, daylight autonomy would give zero credit, while continuous daylight autonomy would give 0.5 credit (200/400 = 0.5). The benefit of continuous daylight autonomy {{is that it does}} not give a hard <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> acceptable <b>illuminance.</b> Instead, it addresses the transition area—allowing for realistic preferences within any given space. For example, office occupants usually prefer to work at daylight below the illuminance threshold since this level avoids potential glare and excessive contrast.|$|R

40|$|Creation {{of light}} for work, socializing, and general {{illumination}} {{is a fundamental}} application of technology around the world. For those who lack access to electricity, an emerging and diverse range of LED based lighting products hold promise for replacing and/or augmenting their current fuel-based lighting sources that are costly and dirty. Along with analysis of environmental factors, economic models for total cost-ofownership of LED lighting products are an important tool for studying the impacts of these products as they emerge in markets of developing countries. One important metric in those models is the minimum illuminance demanded by end-users for a given task before recharging the lamp or replacing batteries. It impacts the lighting service cost per unit time if charging is done with purchased electricity, batteries, or charging services. The concept {{is illustrated in figure}} 1 : LED lighting products are generally brightest immediately after the battery is charged or replaced and the illuminance degrades as the battery is discharged. When a minimum <b>threshold</b> level <b>of</b> <b>illuminance</b> is reached, the operational time for the battery charge cycle is over. The cost to recharge depends on the method utilized; these include charging at a shop at a fixed price per charge, charging on personal grid connections, using solar chargers, and purchasing dry cell batteries.

40|$|Ten {{years of}} {{nighttime}} weather observations from the Northern Hemisphere in December were classified {{according to the}} <b>illuminance</b> <b>of</b> moonlight or twilight on the cloud tops, and a <b>threshold</b> level <b>of</b> <b>illuminance</b> was determined, above which the clouds are apparently detected adequately. This threshold corresponds to light from a full moon at an elevation angle of 6 deg, light from a partial moon at higher elevation, or twilight from the sun less than 9 deg bvelow the horizon. It permits the use of about 38 % of the observations made with the sun below the horizon. The computed diurnal cycles of total cloud cover are altered considerably when this moonlight criterion is imposed. Maximum cloud cover {{over much of the}} ocean is now found to be at night or in the morning, whereas computations obtained without benefit of the moonlight criterion, as in our published atlases, showed the time of maximum to be noon or early afternoon in many regions. The diurnal cycles of total cloud cover we obtain are compared with those of the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) for a few regions; they are generally in better agreement if the moonlight criterion is imposed on the surface observations. Using the moonlight criterion, we have analyzed 10 years (1982 - 91) of surface weather observations over land and ocean, worldwide, for total cloud cover and for the frequency of occurrence of clear sky, fog, and precipitation. The global average cloud cover (average of day and night) is about 2 % higher if the moonlight criterion is imposed than if all observations are used. The difference is greater in winter than in summer, because of the fewer hours of darkness in summer. The amplitude of the annual cycle of total cloud cover over the Arctic Ocean and at the South Pole is diminished by a few percent when the moonlight criterion is imposed. The average cloud cover for 1982 - 91 is found to be 55 % for Northern Hemisphere land, 53 % for Southern Hemisphere land, 66 % for Northern Hemisphere ocean, and 70 % for Southern Hemisphere ocean, giving a global average of 64 %.

40|$|Purpose – Aims {{to examine}} {{judicial}} attitudes to current surveying practice in rights to light disputes. Tests {{the assumption that}} the use of the Waldram methodology is endorsed by the courts and seeks to establish whether, despite its acknowledged limitations, its continued use can be justified on this basis. Design/methodology/approach – Analyses reported judgments. Findings – Neither the 50 - 50 rule, nor any other aspect of the Waldram methodology, has the status of a rule of law, or is otherwise approved of by the courts. On the contrary, the methodology {{has been the subject of}} judicial criticism. Although the courts frequently rely on the expert evidence presented to them, they have consistently expressed disquiet over aspects of the methodology. Particular concerns have been expressed over its inability to cater for the effects of sunlight and externally reflected light, on its dependence on internal room design, and on its failure to distinguish task illumination from general room lighting. There is also no indication that the judiciary are aware of the extent to which the Waldram <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> adequate <b>illuminance</b> falls short <b>of</b> that prescribed by contemporary standards. The paper concludes that the courts' attitudes to the Waldram methodology cannot therefore justify its continued use by surveyors, either when acting in the capacity of expert witness, or when advising clients who may be contemplating litigation in a rights to light dispute. Research limitations/implications – Makes a further contribution to the debate, started in this journal in 2000, about the future of surveying practice in rights to light disputes. Practical implications – Places new information in the public domain which has implications for judges in future rights to light cases, and for the professional liability of surveyors when advising clients in contemplation of possible rights to light litigation.
