5|$|It {{had been}} also conjectured that <b>the</b> <b>double</b> bond between carbons 4 and 5 of the imidazolium ring backbone, which gave {{aromatic}} character to that system, {{was important for}} the carbene's stability.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>doubling</b> {{attack by}} Fouque and Valette and its analogue, <b>the</b> {{relative}} <b>doubling</b> attack, by Yen et al. {{are a new}} kind of simple power analysis that can be applied to a binary double-and-add algorithm in a scalar multiplication (or a multiply-and-square algorithm in a modular exponentiation). <b>The</b> <b>doubling</b> attack is very powerful because it requires just two queries to the device to find the secret key. <b>The</b> original <b>doubling</b> attack broke <b>the</b> binary double-and-add always algorithm and <b>the</b> relative <b>doubling</b> attack succeeded in breaking the Montgomery ladder. Fouque and Valette told that <b>the</b> <b>doubling</b> attack was applicable only to downward algorithms, i. e., "left-to-right" implementations of a binary modular exponentiation and recommended to use upward "right-to-left" implementations. On the contrary, Yen et al. proposed a new downward algorithm and asserted that it was secure against doubling attacks.
