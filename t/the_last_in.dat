5|$|Across {{the county}} line, NY18 becomes the Roosevelt Highway.

While NY63 ends here, Lyndonville Road continues north to the lake as County Route63-1 (CR63-1). This portion of Lyndonville Road was once part of NY63. In Carlton, NY18 intersects the northern terminus of NY279, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>in</b> a series of northsouth routes that terminate at NY18. Not far to the east, the route serves Lakeside Beach State Park and indirectly connects to the western terminus of the Lake Ontario State Parkway.

5|$|Alboin {{was assassinated}} on June 28, 572, in a coup d'état instigated by the Byzantines. It was {{organized}} by the king's foster brother, Helmichis, {{with the support of}} Alboin's wife, Rosamund, daughter of the Gepid king whom Alboin had killed some years earlier. The coup failed in the face of opposition from a majority of the Lombards, who elected Cleph as Alboin's successor, forcing Helmichis and Rosamund to flee to Ravenna under imperial protection. Alboin's death deprived the Lombards of the only leader who could have kept the newborn Germanic entity together, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>in</b> the line of hero-kings who had led the Lombards through their migrations from the vale of the Elbe to Italy. For many centuries following his death Alboin's heroism and his success in battle were celebrated in Saxon and Bavarian epic poetry.|$|E

By 1650 public opinion considered beheading to be an excessively severe punishment for petty theft; use of the gibbet was forbidden by Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, and the structure was dismantled. The stone base was rediscovered and preserved in about 1840, and a non-working replica was erected on the site in 1974. The names of 52 people known to have been beheaded by the device are listed on a nearby plaque.|$|E
5|$|Another {{segment of}} freeway opened in 1987 in Clinton County between US127 near DeWitt and Temp. I-69 near Bath. This section was {{connected}} to the existing freeway at Perry in 1991.

This segment marked <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>in</b> the state to complete Michigan's portion of the Interstate Highway System. At the time it was completed, I-69 was concurrent with US27 from the state line north to the DeWitt area (exit87) and then concurrent with US127 to exit89 before running alone to Port Huron.|$|E

A tentative five-year program {{put together in}} October and supported by President Woodrow Wilson called for ten battleships, six battlecruisers and ten destroyers {{to be completed by}} 1922. This was submitted to Congress in December 1915. On 2 June 1916, the House of Representatives passed the bill in a modified form, replacing five of the battleships with battlecruisers. On 29 August 1916, the Senate also passed an altered bill, keeping the original number of ships but stipulating that the program be completed in three years (FY 1917–19). The first four ships were paid for in FY 1917, the fifth in FY 1918, and <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>in</b> FY 1919.|$|E
5|$|He and Doctor Phlox then tend to Porthos, and Archer {{spends the}} night in Sickbay {{to be with his}} pet. Throughout the night, as Porthos' immune system weakens, Archer {{experiences}} Phlox's side of life in Sickbay. During the night, as he dreams of Porthos' funeral, Archer also deals with unresolved and suppressed sexual tension with T'Pol. He also relates to Phlox how he met Porthos, and how he was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>in</b> a litter of four male puppies, the 'Four Musketeers'. Through it all, Archer struggles to reach an emotional understanding with Phlox and T'Pol, as the two alien senior-crew members have little grasp of the human-pet relationship, and Phlox keeps offering Archer unsolicited advice about dealing with his apparent feelings for T'Pol.|$|E

5|$|In 1805, Klein's {{division}} {{was part of}} the newly created VIII. Corps, under command of Édouard Mortier; the role of the Corps was to patrol and secure the northern shore of the Danube river, limiting the Austro-Russian activity. Napoleon incorrectly assumed that the Russians and the Austrians would make a stand near St. Pölten, northwest of Vienna. Klein's entire regiment of dragoons patrolled the northern Danube shore, while the rest of his division, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>in</b> the extended line of march, was more than a day behind Maxime Gazan's lead division. Klein's division did not take part in the Battle of Dürenstein, although his dragoons were with Mortier and Gazan immediately prior to the engagement.|$|E
