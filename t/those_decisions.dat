This facility is located in an old bank building and houses court and tribunal records dating back to <b>those</b> <b>decisions</b> made under the Knights Hospitaller. The second facility is the Archives' Gozo location, which holds over 9,000 items. The final facility {{to be opened}} was the Head Office, located in Rabat, which was officially opened in 1994.

5|$|The Supreme Court, {{reversing}} the Fifth Circuit, {{held that the}} NLRB decision was appropriate because its interpretation of the NLRA was permissible. The Court explained that the NLRB is entrusted with the responsibility to adapt the NLRA to changing times and {{that as a result}} courts reviewing its decisions only have the authority to reject its interpretations of the NLRA if <b>those</b> <b>decisions</b> are impermissible under it. This also led to the Court's observation that the NLRB can change its interpretation of the NLRA over time and is not required to comply with its earlier decisions.|$|E
5|$|The NLRB {{applied a}} right it had {{recently}} announced in Quality Mfg. Co. and then clarified in Mobil Oil Corp. that employees in unionized workplaces {{had a right}} under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) {{to the presence of}} a union representative during any inquiry where the employee's job might be in jeopardy. The NLRB had explained in <b>those</b> <b>decisions</b> that having a union representative present was an exercise of the right to the 'mutual aid and protection' protected by Section 7. Therefore, an employer's refusal of such presence was an unfair labor practice and actionable under the NLRA. As a result, the NLRB found that Weingarten had engaged in an unfair labor practice by refusing Collins a representative and Weingarten appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.|$|E

The union waged jurisdictional strikes to claim work that other unions, such as the Machinists, Sheet Metal Workers and Electrical Workers claimed as theirs.

30|$|In {{studies of}} cardiac {{diseases}} {{which are the}} target domain of this paper, some works have aimed at automatically processing or analyzing videos of CT (computed tomography) or angiography [17, 18]. Also, some systems have been developed in order to inform patients’ conditions to medical experts, to recommend required treatments, or to predict prognoses [19, 20]. However, these works considered a single kind of medical data and applied statistical analyses or rule-based mining to fragmentary data of patients’ current conditions. <b>Those</b> <b>decision</b> or diagnosis systems have little practicality in real medical institutions.|$|R

25|$|Although {{software}} (hyphenation algorithms) {{can often}} automatically {{make decisions on}} when to hyphenate a word at a line break, it is also sometimes useful for the user {{to be able to}} insert cues for <b>those</b> <b>decisions</b> (which are dynamic in the online medium, given that text can be reflowed). For this purpose, the concept of a soft hyphen (discretionary hyphen, optional hyphen) was introduced, allowing such manual specification of a place where a hyphenated break is allowed but not forced. That is, it does not force a line break in an inconvenient place when the text is later reflowed.|$|E
25|$|Game theorists use the Nash {{equilibrium}} {{concept to}} analyze {{the outcome of the}} strategic interaction of several decision makers. In other words, it provides a way of predicting what will happen if several people or several institutions are making decisions at the same time, and if the outcome depends on the decisions of the others. The simple insight underlying John Nash's idea is that one cannot predict the result of the choices of multiple decision makers if one analyzes <b>those</b> <b>decisions</b> in isolation. Instead, one must ask what each player would do, taking into account the decision-making of the others.|$|E
25|$|On April 18, 2007, the Supreme Court {{handed down}} a 5 to 4 {{decision}} upholding {{the constitutionality of}} the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.

40|$|Although {{backpropagation}} {{neural networks}} generally predict better than decision trees do for pattern classification problems, {{they are often}} regarded as black boxes, i. e., their predictions are not as interpretable as <b>those</b> of <b>decision</b> trees.

25|$|Deliberative indeterminism {{asserts that}} the indeterminism is {{confined}} to an earlier stage in the decision process.

Deliberative indeterminism has been referenced by Daniel Dennett and John Martin Fischer.

25|$|Opponents {{of legal}} {{recognition}} for same-sex couples filed two lawsuits in the Superior Court of California.

Randy Thomasson (an opponent of gay rights and head of the Campaign for California Families) filed a similar lawsuit, which challenged both A.B. 205 and the earlier domestic-partner expansion in A.B. 25. Both lawsuits, consolidated into a single action, failed at the trial and appellate courts.

40|$|The {{present study}} focused on {{procedural}} justice {{in the context of}} restorative justice conferencing, where disputants themselves, rather than judges or juries, make outcome decisions.

25|$|The {{problems}} with mutual fund trading that cast market timing {{in a negative}} light occurred because the prospectuses written by the mutual fund companies strictly forbid short-term trading. Despite this prohibition, special clients were allowed to do it anyway. So, the problem was not with the trading strategy but rather with the unethical and unfair implementation of that strategy, which permitted some investors to engage in it while excluding others. All of the world's greatest investors rely, to some extent, on market timing for their success. Whether they base their buy-sell decisions on fundamental analysis of the markets, technical analysis of individual companies, personal intuition, {{or all of the}} above, the ultimate reason for their success involves making the right trades at the right time. In most cases, <b>those</b> <b>decisions</b> involve extended periods of time and are based on buy-and-hold investment strategies. Value investing is a clear example, as the strategy is based on buying stocks that trade for less than their intrinsic values and selling them when their value is recognized in the marketplace. Most value investors are known for their patience, as undervalued stocks often remain undervalued for significant periods of time.|$|E
