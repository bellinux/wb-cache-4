40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} and compare histopathological and computerized tomographic (CT) findings of experimental acute sinusitis in an animal model. The noses of five healthy rabbits were inoculated with a gelatin sponge impregnated with a solution containing Staphylococcus aureus, and one healthy rabbit acted as the control. The animals were sacrificed on the tenth day, following the acquisition of paranasal CT scans. Specimens were obtained from the lateral nasal walls, and the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses of <b>the</b> animals for <b>histopathological</b> <b>examination.</b> <b>Histopathological</b> and CT findings were compared. Various degrees of epithelial disorganization, foci of ruptured epithelial cells, and inflammatory cell infiltration in the lamina propria were seen in <b>the</b> <b>histopathological</b> <b>examinations</b> of <b>the</b> five study rabbits, and mucosal thickening and soft tissue density were noted in their CTs. There was no correlation between <b>the</b> <b>histopathological</b> and CT findings. It was shown that CT did not reflect the acute changes in the sinus mucosa. Patients with chronic sinusitis must be evaluated for a chronic process. Computerized tomographic scans should not be obtained in acute sinusitis cases. In this way, both unnecessary radiation exposure and economic waste can be avoided...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{protective}} effect of silymarin (SMN) on mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) –induced duodenal disorders was investigated. Materials and Methods: Forty-two Wistar rats {{were assigned to}} seven groups including control and test groups. The control animals received saline and the test animals were treated with MMF (30 mg/kg, orally) and saline, MMF and SMN (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg, orally), MMF and Celecoxib (CLX, 50 mg/kg, orally), and MMF and SMN plus CLX for 14 consecutive days. The antioxidant status and myeloperoxidase activity were determined and <b>the</b> <b>histopathological</b> <b>examinations</b> on duodenal section also were performed. Results: Biochemical analyses revealed that SMN and CLX individually and in combination therapy could reduce the MMF-increased nitric oxide (NO) content, myeloperoxidase (MPA) activity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) level, while the MMF-reduced level of total thiol molecules (TTM) was increased significantly (...|$|R

Radiological investigation revealed that the tumor was invading the sagittal, transverse, sigmoid sinus and junction of the internal jugular vein to subclavian vein, which was filled with tumor. <b>The</b> <b>histopathological</b> <b>examinations</b> revealed that both the cerebral tumor and mass in the internal jugular vein contributed to the transitional meningioma. This is a rare case of a meningioma extending into the internal jugular vein through the sinuses. According to this case, the frontal parasagittal meningioma could invade directly the internal jugular vein.
