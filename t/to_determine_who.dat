5|$|In general, most field events allow a {{competitor}} {{to take their}} attempt individually, under theoretically the same conditions as the other competitors in the competition. Each attempt is measured <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>who</b> achieved the longest distance.|$|E
5|$|Digimon Racing is {{a racing}} video game that {{utilizes}} characters and elements from Digimon {{as well as}} those of traditional racing games. The game follows a group of Digimon competing in a racing tournament within the Digital World, home to all Digimon. The purpose of the grand prix is <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>who</b> is the best racer; thus, they use specially designed karts that equate all contestants in terms of ability.|$|E
50|$|Where {{there are}} more than one {{classification}} in one event, (for example discus throw F54/55/56), a percentage system is used <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>who's</b> the winner.|$|R
5000|$|Round one {{introduces}} {{three people}} who all claim to own the same pet. It's up to the panel <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>who's</b> [...] "lying like a dog" [...] by quizzing them about their day-to-day life with their pet. Locating the true owner will earn the panelist 25 points.|$|R
50|$|What {{does this}} mean? It {{means that when}} white people are evenly divided, and Black people have a bloc of votes of their own, it is left up <b>to</b> them <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>who's</b> going <b>to</b> sit in the White House and who's {{going to be in}} the dog house.|$|R
5|$|During William the Conqueror's reign, St-Calais was a {{frequent}} witness on charters. While {{it is often difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>who</b> was considered most important on a charter's witness list, placement {{near the top of the}} list is usually understood to mean that the signatory was considered important. Almost always during the Conqueror's reign, St-Calais is listed right below the royal family and the archbishops.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Affeldt {{found himself}} {{competing}} with Runelvys Hernández {{for the first}} spot in the Royals' starting rotation during Spring training. Because Tony Peña, the Royals' manager, was unable to decide which one would be the ace, he flipped a coin <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>who</b> would be number one. Hernández won the toss.|$|E
5|$|Theseus– A {{servant of}} the Sisters of Fate {{guarding}} the Steeds of Time. Theseus challenged Kratos <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>who</b> was the greatest warrior in all of Greece, but was killed in battle. The character was voiced by Paul Eiding in God of War II.|$|E
50|$|The coroner's {{jurisdiction}} {{is limited}} <b>to</b> <b>determining</b> <b>who</b> the deceased was and how, {{when and where}} they came by their death.

For a Rush Day, where wannabe Sorority Girls must face {{a series of}} harsh {{interviews}} from the Sorority Sisters <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>who's</b> suitable <b>to</b> be a provisional member of the sorority.|$|R
50|$|Regulation of {{composition}} extends <b>to</b> <b>determining</b> <b>who</b> is elected {{and whether they}} may take their seat. The result of elections is now de facto a matter for an Election Court composed of High Court judges, who issue a certificate to the Speaker {{in the case of}} elections where the result is disputed. The House also has exclusive right <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> whether members may take up their seat, including whether a member is eligible to take the relevant oath.|$|R
5|$|Conflicting reports {{initially}} made {{it impossible}} <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>who</b> had made the first kill, {{which would be the}} first North Korean plane shot down by the United Nations forces in the war. Later research indicated Hudson had successfully shot down the first aircraft. The exact timing of Hudson and Moran's victories remains unclear, and it is possible each scored a victory within seconds of the other. For his determination in leading the flight, though, Little was awarded a Silver Star Medal.|$|E
5|$|Following the Supreme Court ruling, Taylor fled to Indianapolis, Indiana, fearing {{he would}} be implicated in Goebel's assassination. Beckham became acting governor, {{but because of the}} unusual {{circumstances}} surrounding the election, a special election was held November 6, 1900, <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>who</b> would complete Goebel's unexpired term. Beckham (now of age) won the election over Republican John W. Yerkes by fewer than 4,000 votes. Shortly following the special election, Beckham married Jean Raphael Fuqua of Owensboro. The couple had two sons.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, {{after the}} Rockets won a coin toss against the Baltimore Bullets <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>who</b> {{would have the}} first overall pick in the 1968 NBA Draft, they {{selected}} Elvin Hayes from the University of Houston. Hayes led the team to the franchise's first ever playoff appearance in 1969, but the Rockets lost in the semi-finals of the Western Division to the Atlanta Hawks, four games to two. In 1970 NBA Draft, the Rockets drafted Calvin Murphy and Rudy Tomjanovich, who would both spend their whole careers with the Rockets.|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] In the 1970 s social {{scientists}} from all disciplines {{became aware that}} {{an understanding of how}} labor markets function is central <b>to</b> <b>determining</b> <b>who</b> benefits from economic growth. Only a few researchers concerned with the economic development of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, however, have examined labor markets in any serious way. Hence, a compendium entitled Studies of Urban Labour Market Behavior in Developing Areas is particularly welcome...|$|R
40|$|Clarification {{is needed}} {{of the law}} {{relating}} to the obligation imposed on medical practitioners to render assistance to persons who are injured or at risk of injury. Although a legal duty {{has been found to}} exist, the relevant law requires clarification in a number of areas, especially in relation <b>to</b> <b>determining</b> <b>who</b> actually owes a duty to assist, the precise nature of the duty of care owed, and what steps medical practitioners must take to effectively discharge their duty to assist...|$|R
50|$|The {{order that}} a judge gives as <b>to</b> costs <b>determines</b> <b>who</b> {{will be the}} paying and who the {{receiving}} party.

5|$|Luna {{was active}} as a {{researcher}} in the scientific community. After receiving his doctorate in 1893, he published a scientific treatise on malaria entitled On Malarial Pathology (El Hematozoario del Paludismo), which was favorably received in the scientific community. He then went to Belgium and France, and worked as assistant to Dr. Latteaux at the Pasteur Institute and to Dr. Laffen. In recognition of his ability, he was commissioned by the Spanish government to study tropical and communicable diseases. In 1894, {{he returned to the}} Philippines where he took part in an examination <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>who</b> would become the chief chemist of the Municipal Laboratory of Manila. Luna came in first and won the position.|$|E
5|$|Mathias' {{candidacy}} consideration did not endear him to {{the conservative}} wing of the Maryland Republican Party organization. In June 1976, he lost a vote by state Republicans <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>who</b> would represent Maryland on the platform committee at the 1976 Republican National Convention. Instead, the group chose George Price, a conservative member of the Maryland House of Delegates from Baltimore County. At one point, Mathias was close to being denied attendance to the convention altogether as an at-large delegate, but a last minute compromise ensured all Republican congressional representatives seats as at-large delegates. Mathias maintained a low profile during the convention, and received harsh criticism {{from some of the}} conservative delegates from Maryland who attended.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, with Ralph missing, {{his game}} is {{labelled}} as malfunctioning and faces being unplugged. Felix, upon learning where Ralph went from Q*Bert, ventures to Hero's Duty, {{teaming up with}} the game's heroine, Sergeant Calhoun, to retrieve Ralph and the Cy-Bug. In Sugar Rush, Ralph's medal is stolen by the glitching Vanellope Von Schweetz to buy {{her way into the}} daily races <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>who</b> players can choose as their avatar. King Candy, the ruler of Sugar Rush, forbids her from doing so due to her being a glitch. Ralph and Vanellope agree to work together by building a race kart for Vanellope to win a race and retrieve the medal.|$|E
5000|$|Starting with {{a game of}} Rock-Paper-Scissors <b>to</b> <b>determining</b> <b>who</b> plays first, players {{take turns}} {{identifying}} sets of three cards in which the three features are either all the same or all different. (For example: Circle-Red-Black, Square-Red-White, Triangle-Red-Gray.) If they see a set, the player says [...] "Hap!", and identifies the three cards. If the set is valid, the player scores a point. If the set is invalid, or has already been called, the player loses a point. If 10 seconds pass without a [...] "Hap!" [...] call, play passes to the other player.|$|R
50|$|Paramedics {{are able}} <b>to</b> {{accurately}} <b>determine</b> <b>who</b> needs {{or does not}} need neck immobilization based on an algorithms.

5|$|Plymouth Argyle had {{finished}} the 199596 Football League season in fourth place in the Third Division, one place ahead of Darlington. Therefore, both missed out on the three automatic promotion places and instead {{took part in the}} play-offs <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>who</b> would join Preston North End, Gillingham, and Bury as the fourth promoted team. On {{the final day of the}} league season, Plymouth Argyle had the opportunity to finish third in the table and thereby clinch the final automatic promotion place but a 30 win at Home Park against Hartlepool United was not enough to overtake Bury, after they also won 30 at home to Cardiff City.|$|E
5|$|The Horne family—Ben (Richard Beymer), Audrey (Sherilyn Fenn), and Johnny (Robert Bauer)—are {{eating dinner}} {{when they are}} {{interrupted}} by Ben's brother Jerry (David Patrick Kelly). The brothers share brie and butter baguettes while Ben tells Jerry of Laura Palmer's murder and the failing of the Ghostwood project. They decide to visit One Eyed Jacks, a casino and brothel across the Canada–US border, where Ben wins a coin flip <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>who</b> {{will be the first}} to sleep with the newest prostitute.|$|E
5|$|The court {{declared}} that Hill was not validly elected at the 1998 federal election. However, {{they did not}} declare the whole election invalid, acting on an earlier decision of the court, because although no effect could be given to voters' preferences for Hill, their other preferences were not invalid, and those could be used <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>who</b> should be elected in Hill's stead. The court did not reach a definite decision about what action should be taken, remitting that question to a lower court. Eventually, Len Harris, the number two candidate on the One Nation ticket, was elected in Hill's stead, taking up his seat on 1 July 1999.|$|E
50|$|Similarly, EGFR (HER-1) is overexpressed in {{a variety}} of cancers {{including}} head and neck and colon. Immunohistochemistry is used <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> patients <b>who</b> may benefit from therapeutic antibodies such as Erbitux (cetuximab). Commercial systems to detect EGFR by immunohistochemistry include the Dako pharmDx.|$|R
50|$|During Shumway's {{tenure as}} {{president}} of BYU-Hawaii, the school focused on increasing {{the percentage of students}} from outside the United States.

5|$|The {{first point}} regards two officially listed victims, Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer. They were {{reported}} missing after the explosion. In the aftermath, investigators {{were able to}} locate individuals named Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer who were alive and well. However, they were unable <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>who</b> reported Hiatt missing, {{and the person who}} was listed as reporting Thayer missing claimed she wasn't the one who had done so. Since the investigators could not thus verify that they were the same Hiatt and Thayer who were reported missing, the names remain listed among the presumed dead.|$|E
5|$|The term {{coronation}} {{is sometimes}} {{used in a}} semi-ironic sense to refer to uncontested party leadership elections, with all potential party leaders choosing to back a single candidate or to stay silent, rather than stand in an election {{they are likely to}} lose. This typically happens where there has been a protracted behind-the-scenes attempt to remove the outgoing leader, leading to a significant amount of time <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>who</b> has the most party support before the election proper.|$|E
5|$|The {{total number}} of seats in the Parliament are {{allocated}} to parties proportionally {{to the number of}} votes received in the second vote of the ballot using the d'Hondt method. For example, <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>who</b> is awarded the first list seat, the number of list votes cast for each party is divided by one plus the number of seats the party won in the region (at this point just constituency seats). The party with the highest quotient is awarded the seat, which is then added to its constituency seats in allocating the second seat. This is repeated iteratively until all available list seats are allocated.|$|E
50|$|A {{lock-out}} {{device is}} a system used on game shows, particularly trivia shows, <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> in real time which contestant has activated their signal first. The system is designed to detect the first signal it receives and ignore subsequent signals. The system provides some indication of which contestant has signaled, such as a light for each contestant, allowing the relevant parties <b>to</b> clearly <b>determine</b> <b>who</b> has signaled first.|$|R
50|$|A Sheriff's posse of over 1000 armed men, found, {{shot and}} killed him about 200 miles {{northwest}} during a lengthy chase through the swamps.
