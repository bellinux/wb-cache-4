40|$|International audienceCO 2 {{transportation}} {{is an integral}} part of the CCS chain. After capture, CO 2 needs to be transported to locations whereby it is stored or alternatively used in various processes. CO 2 can be transported via ship or pipeline. In both cases, the required compression pressure can be 100 – 300 bar, depending on the distance and intended disposal or use of CO 2. The CO 2 rich stream can contain a lot of impurities which can modify the phase diagram and change the thermophysical properties of the stream in comparison with the ones of pure CO 2. Indeed, along with carbon dioxide, a great number of compounds such as water, O 2, N 2, Ar, SOx, NOx, H 2 and CO can be present at different levels of concentration. During <b>transportation</b> <b>by</b> <b>pipeline,</b> if the pipe suffers a major fracture due to an accidental release or a failure, CO 2 can rapidly expand and cool: vapour cloud followed by solid formation of CO 2 may appear.

The presence of water can also be a source of gas hydrate formation, ice or corrosion.

40|$|Student Number : 9803381 J - MSc Dissertation - Faculty of Engineering and the Built EnvironmentAlthough {{pulsed power}} {{has been used in}} many parts of the world over the last few decades to {{initiate}} high-voltage discharges through rock, no systematic test work on South African ore bodies and related rock types has been done so far. As part of CSIR Miningtek’s integrated approach of combining underground comminution with a novel Tore© hydrotransport system, which has been shown to operate well with coarse particles up to 10 mm, various rock types were fragmented in single discharge mode under laboratory conditions. The work was conducted at the University of the Witwatersrand’s high-voltage laboratory with a custom-designed test rig. The rig configuration was based on a critical review and analysis of the literature and on assessments of existing test facilities elsewhere. Core samples with diameters ranging from 16 to 48 mm were cut from test specimens with thicknesses ranging from 8 to 48 mm. Rock types included Ventersdorp Contact Reef, Carbon Leader, Elsburg Formation, UG 2 and Merensky, as well as pure quartz, shales, lava and dykes. A six-stage Marx generator provided a voltage rise time of 2 000 kV/μs to create a discharge through the rock, in preference to a discharge through the surrounding water, which acts as an insulator at ramp-up times faster than 0, 5 μs. High-speed photography, and an analysis of the voltage and current signals for various rock types and for water alone, were used to quantify the potential benefits of rock breaking by electric discharge. It was found that some Kimberlite specimens and mineralised gold-bearing reefs were much easier to fragment than hanging wall or footwall material. Merensky reef appeared to be more susceptible than the less brittle UG 2 material. A correlation was derived between the dynamic resistivity of various rock types, measured at 16 MHz excitation frequency, and the electrical breakdown strength at which discharge took place. The fragments created had a more cubical shape than would be created by conventional impact crushing. However, the high voltage requirements of about 30 to 35 kV per millimetre of rock thickness would necessitate not only efficient mechanical and electrical contact between the electrodes and the rock, but also considerable safety features for underground installations. The clearly identified, preferential fracturing of reef rock types, compared with the hanging or footwall materials, suggests that the greater benefit of electric rock breaking may lie in primary rock breaking as a mining method, rather than in secondary comminution of broken rock to enable hydraulic <b>transportation</b> <b>by</b> <b>pipeline</b> to surface...|$|E
40|$|Biofuels, {{especially}} ethanol, {{are gaining}} attention as partial replacements of imported fuels and to offset CO 2 emissions {{from the burning}} of fossil fuels. Consequently, legislation is being proposed to mandate {{a significant increase in}} ethanol usage as a fuel over the next 20 years. The planned wide-spread usage of ethanol will require an efficient and reliable transportation and storage system that encompasses both the existing infrastructure and new construction. The fuels are currently being transported by rail, truck, and ship; however, in order to economically transport biofuels from producers to users on a large scale, safe and reliable <b>transportation</b> <b>by</b> <b>pipeline</b> is necessary. Prior industry experience and research has shown that stress corrosion cracking (SCC) can initiate in some fuel-grade ethanols. Detailed laboratory studies indicate that primary factors contributing to the initiation of SCC include the presence of dissolved oxygen and other contaminants, including pre-existing corrosion products, and the corrosion potential of the fuel. The source of the fuel (e. g., corn, sugar cane), the gasoline-to-ethanol blend ratio, and handling of the fuel from production to end-user delivery influences the significance of these factors as well as the operational and maintenance protocols to be applied for safe transportation of the fuel by pipeline. In addition to pipeline reliability, quality of the fuel as it travels down the pipeline to the end-user must be assured. Finally, the effect of ethanol on other metallic and non-metallic components needs to be evaluated. In an effort to solicit broad perspectives on the activities needed to enhance the safe and reliable transportation of ethanol, a Road Mapping meeting was held in Dublin, Ohio on October 25 and 26 th, 2007 {{with the support of the}} Association of Oil Pipe Lines (AOPL), American Petroleum Institute (API), U. S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), and Pipeline Research Council International (PRCI).

The workshop consisted of a series of plenary presentations followed by detailed breakout sessions on four topics: Ethanol Sources and Quality Issues; Pipeline Integrity; Pipeline Operations; and Standards, Guidelines, and Training.

40|$|AbstractA key {{aspect of}} the Lake Nyos {{incident}} was the exceptionally large quantity of CO 2 that was abruptly released in the incident. The exact quantity is uncertain however there is a consensus view that it amounted to between 1. 0 and 1. 6 million metric tons of CO 2. In the context of CO 2 sequestration this minimum amount of CO 2 corresponds with approximately four months emissions from a 275 MW FutureGen type IGCC or over a month of CO 2 captured from a large, but not atypical, 1000 MW coal fired power plant. This volume of CO 2 is also equivalent to weeks or months of gas that would be transported in the largest pipelines contemplated for a future sequestration project. Given the isolation valves that would be activated the CO 2 released at Lake Nyos was 2 to 3 orders of magnitude larger than the largest release plausible from CO 2 pipelines. Carbon monoxide poisoning utilizing automobile exhaust in an enclosed space for decades was a classic suicide strategy. Since the development of catalytic convertors the carbon monoxide has been in large part converted to carbon dioxide and a nominally non-lethal level of carbon monoxide. Unfortunately suicidal acts continued unabated due to the powerful effects of mixed CO 2 and CO. Although the medical teams reported no definitive evidence of cause of death, they did note that many victims had prominent skin bullae (blister like features) or has succumbed to comas, and that neither of these prominent symptoms {{can be related to}} CO 2. The US medical team concluded that “doubt must remain that all the findings can be attributed to [CO 2] alone” After the Lake Nyos incident, evaluation of the symptoms documented in medical studies from the foreign scientific expeditions lead to a conclusion that the Lake Nyos victims died from carbon monoxide poisoning. Although these assertions have been dismissed by geologists studying the Lake Nyos event, their reasoning appears flawed. A plausible model for the causative agents for the Nyos disaster was a combination of CO 2 (quite possibly at non-lethal concentrations), reduced oxygen, and the critical deadly agent, CO. In the absence of carbon monoxide neither the gas in exhausts from catalytic convertor nor the gas at Lake Nyos, would be capable of killing. This together with the magnitude and circumstances of the release has significance for risks associated with CO 2 <b>transportation</b> <b>by</b> <b>pipeline.</b> Mixed gases are known to be deadly at concentrations at significantly lower than the lethal levels of either component alone. Perhaps the real lesson of the Lake Nyos incident for carbon capture and storage is {{to draw attention to the}} inherent danger from mixtures of toxic gases. For example mixtures of H 2 S with CO 2 will increase the toxic effects of H 2 S. The risk profile for a sequestration project changed a decision is made to inject mixed streams of gas such as CO 2 +H 2 S rather than essentially pure CO 2. A more useful analogy between natural CO 2 seepage and the worst-case scenario for leakage from CO 2 sequestered in deep brine reservoirs is provided by the volcanic/geothermal terrains in Italy, the Azores, and Africa. In this paper the available information and analysis of the presumed CO 2 releases at these sites and the related deaths are reviewed and the implications for evaluating the risk posed by eithe r slow or rapid leakage from CO 2 sequestration are considered...|$|E

40|$|Deux types de {{membranes}} peuvent être utilisés pour la séparation des gaz. Les unes sont poreuses et séparent les gaz sur la base de leur masse moléculaire selon un mécanisme de diffusion de Knudsen dans des micropores. Les facteurs de séparation obtenus sont généralement trop faibles pour présenter un intérêt industriel. Les autres, appelées membranes non poreuses, mettent en oeuvre un mécanisme de dissolution-diffusion des gaz dans une fine couche de polymère dénuée de toute porosité. C'est de ces dernières que nous allons parler. Commencé il y a une vingtaine d'années, le développement de ce type de membranes {{a conduit}} aux premières applications industrielles en 1979 avec l'introduction par Monsanto des séparateurs PRISM pour la récupération d'hydrogène à partir de différents gaz de raffinerie et de pétrochimie. Après des débuts modestes par suite de la compétition avec des technologies éprouvées comme la cryogénie, l'adsorption et l'absorption, la perméation gazeuse est en train de conquérir sa place parmi les techniques de séparation de gaz. Elle est aujourd'hui l'une des techniques membranaires présentant le plus fort taux de progression (30 % par an). Après un rappel des principes de base de la perméation gazeuse on abordera successivement les points suivants : - le choix du polymère constituant la couche séparatrice, - l'élaboration des membranes à structure asymétrique présentant une peau dense et fine, - les principales applications industrielles. Cela permettra de mettre en évidence les avantages et les limitations actuelles de la perméation gazeuse et de souligner les différents domaines où les efforts de R et D peuvent amener des progrès significatifs. Principle of Gas permeation - Gas permeation {{is a technique}} for fractionating gas mixtures by using nonporous polymer membranes having a selective permeability to gas according to a dissolution-diffusion mechanism. Gas is made {{to pass through the}} membrane by applying a pressure difference {{on either side of the}} membrane. This pressure difference causes a difference in dissolved gas concentration between the two faces of the membrane and hence a diffusional gas flow through the membrane. Choice of Polymer - The gas sorption capacity of the polymer depends on its free volume and its physical affinity for the gas. For a gas mixture, differences in affinity are selectivity factors. The mobility of sorbed molecules depends on the free volume of the polymer and on the degree of rigidity of the chains. Vitreous polymers are more selective in this respect than rubbery polymers. This is why they are generally chosen for manufacturing gas permeation membranes. Permeability and selectivity are somewhat antinomic properties, especially when the selectivity is of a diffusional type, i. e. when the polymer acts as a molecular sieve. The definition of new polymers providing a better compromise between permeability and selectivity thus goes via research on the relationships between structure and the permeability to the gas to be separated. In polymers in a vitreous state, the chains are fixed overall, but small local movements, for example such as the rotation of an aromatic nucleus around bonds in the para position, remain possible. It seems that such small movements are beneficial for permeability, while not detracting very much from the selectivity. Structures of chains that are unfavorable for compact piling increase permeability in general to the detriment of selectivity. This is true for chains having non-coplanar aromatic nuclei or ones having bulky groups. Tables 2, 3 and 4 give some structural and permeability data for various polyimides. Figures 4 and 5 show the performances for hydrogen/ methane and carbon-dioxide/methane separations of various polyimides synthesized in our laboratories. Asymmetric MembranesThe membranes used in practice have a particular structure that is called asymmetric, which combines high permeability and good mechanical strength. This structure has a thin dense and selective skin (0. 1 to 1 µm thick) supported by a thick microporous substructure (50 to 200 µm). Such membranes come either in a flat shape or in the form of hollow fibers with their skin outside. The asymmetric structure is obtained by the so-called phase inversiontechnique, which consists in transforming a homogeneous polymer solution into a two-phase medium made up of a polymer-rich phase and a polymer-poor phase. The continuous rich phase prefigures the pore walls of the substructure. Once the poor phase becomes continuous, it will make up a network of communicating pores. Phase inversion can be caused in several ways: (a) solvent departure by evaporation (dry process) (b) introduction of a nonsolvent (wet process) (c) dry-wet process (d) temperature reduction (thermal process). The dense skin is formed on the side where evaporation takes place or where contact is made with the nonsolvent, or again on the cooled side (with the other side being in contact with the support for a flat membrane and a more or less coagulating liquid with a hollow fiber). A dense skin is formed by the superficial polymer overconcentration resulting from solvent evaporation or from its extraction by the nonsolvent before phase inversion. Figure 6 shows a ternary polymer-solvent-nonsolvent isothermal phase diagram on which arrows indicate how the homogeneous polymer solution (I) evolves toward a liquidliquid phase separation (II) or toward a gel structure (III). Industrial Development -Industrial permeators have large membrane surface areas in a compact form. These areas can be up to 500 m²/m³ for the flat version and up to 8000 m²/m³ for the hollow-fiber version. This compactness is obtained by the spiral winding of flat membranes or by the grouping of hollow fibers in bundles. Fig. 7 shows both types of permeators. The advantages of gas permeation lie in the small investment required, low energy consumption, great flexibility of implementation because of the modular nature and the possibility of the great automation of permeators, and the moderate size and weight of the installation. Limitations are linked to the difficulty in obtaining both good purity and high yield for a product with a membrane surface area that is economically acceptable. Likewise, the pressure drop undergone by the permeate may be a disadvantage. Gas permeation can be associated with other separation techniques such as pressure swing adsorption, freeze drying or absorption. The principal applications of gas permeation at present are as follows: (a) Hydrogen recovery from drain effluents from ammonia synthesis units in which hydrogen has to be separated from nitrogen, methane and argon. (b) Hydrogen recovery from refinery gas in which the hydrogen is mixed with hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulfide and water vapor. (c) Adjustment of the hydrogen/carbon-monoxide ratio of alcohol synthesis gas. (d) Air fractionating from the production of blanketing nitrogen. (e) Natural-gas dehydration and sweetening with a view to its <b>transportation</b> <b>by</b> <b>pipeline,</b> especially in offshore production.

40|$|Crude oil {{and other}} liquid {{materials}} are transported {{in large quantities}} through pipelines. Pipelines are an efficient and safe transport way as compared to both rail and road transportation, both from the economical and environmental points of view. Nevertheless, loss of containment accidents can occur due to external action ea mechanical impact, for examplee or to corrosion, aging, etc. Even though the frequency of such events is certainly very low, the effects and consequences on environment can be very important. The consequences of accidents in pipelines can be efficiently reduced through a suitable design of the whole system. One of the points which must be decided in the design is the installation of blocking valves at appropriate distances, so that emergency shutdowns can interrupt the flow of substance and isolate the section where the loss of containment has taken place. In the case of pipe rupture the amount released is therefore limited to the content between two consecutive valves, usually placed according to heuristic criteria. However, if too many valves are used, the capital cost of equipment increases excessively, and if too few are used, the risk of serious accidents increases. In this paper we consider the possibility of improving the design of such systems by applying riskbased optimization criteria. We propose an optimization methodology to solve this conflict {{by means of an}} objective function that analyzes the variations in overall costs, including the cost of the investment (with specific reference to blocking valves) and the cost of accidents.

The foundation of the building was constructed from cut stone taken from the Humboldt Refining Company near Plumer. The round corners of the original building were achieved by using curved bricks, with decorative bricks providing various patterns in other areas of the building. Between the main building and the Annex is the beautiful wrought iron, spiral fire escape. There was a great attention to details in the construction of The National Transit Building. The main entrance floors are marble. Wall paneling is solid oak. The banisters and newel posts are wrought iron with ornate brass and bronze appliques. American Civil War cannonballs were fashioned into doorknobs. Another impressive site is the water-powered elevator in the Annex. It is modeled after an elevator built in the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The elevator was operable until this type of elevator was banned by the state, although the intricate mechanism is still visible.|$|R
