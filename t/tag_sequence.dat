25|$|Two oligonucleotides {{are used}} for this step (Figure 1: Adapter oligos). One of the oligonucleotides {{contains}} a 12 nucleotide single stranded random <b>tag</b> <b>sequence</b> followed by a fixed 5' nucleotide sequence (Black sequence in figure 1). In this step oligonucleotides are annealed in a complementary region by incubation at the required temporal condition.|$|E
25|$|Trimmed {{sequences}} {{from the}} previous step are aligned to the reference genome using Burrows-Wheeler aligner (BWA) and the unmapped reads are removed. The aligned reads that have the same 24 bp <b>tag</b> <b>sequence</b> and genomic region are detected and grouped together (Family αβ and βα in the figure 2). Each group represents a “tag family”. Tag families with lower than three members are removed from the analysis. To remove errors arise during PCR amplification or sequencing, mutations that are supported by less than 70% of the members (reads) are filtered out from the analysis. Then a consensus sequence is generated for each family using the identical sequences in each position of the remaining reads. The consensus sequence is called single strand consensus sequence (SSCS). The SSCS method increases the NGS accuracy to about 20 fold higher, however this method relies on the sequencing information from single strands of DNA and therefore is sensitive to the errors induced at the first round or before PCR amplification.|$|E
25|$|During {{preparation}} for sequencing, cDNA copies of transcripts may be amplified by PCR to enrich for fragments that contain the expected 5’ and 3’ adapter sequences. Amplification {{is also used}} to allow sequencing of very low input amounts of RNA, down to as little as 50 pg, in extreme applications. Spike-in controls can be used to provide quality control assessment of library preparation and sequencing, in terms of GC-content, fragment length, as well as the bias due to fragment position within a transcript. Unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) are short random sequences that are used to individually <b>tag</b> <b>sequence</b> fragments during library preparation, so that every tagged fragment is unique. UMIs provide an absolute scale for quantification and the opportunity to correct for subsequent amplification bias introduced during library construction, and accurately estimate the initial sample size. UMIs are particularly well suited to single-cell RNA-Seq transcriptomics, where the amount of input RNA is restricted and extended amplification of the sample is required.|$|E
50|$|ChIP {{has also}} been applied for genome wide {{analysis}} by combining with microarray technology (ChIP-on-chip) or second generation DNA-sequencing technology (Chip-Sequencing). ChIP can also combine with paired-end <b>tags</b> <b>sequencing</b> in Chromatin Interaction Analysis using Paired End <b>Tag</b> <b>sequencing</b> (ChIA-PET), a technique developed for large-scale, de novo analysis of higher-order chromatin structures.|$|R
40|$|Dog, hamster, monkey and {{zebrafish}} {{are just}} a few of the animals that serve as models for human disease studies and toxicology evaluations. Because these organisms are partially sequenced, a complete transcriptome expression profiling method must go beyond the boundaries of the few known genes to explore transcriptional activity in predicted genes and unsequenced chromosomal regions. Using gene expression data, in the form of <b>tag</b> <b>sequences</b> from the GenCompass universal microarray platform, we profile the dog liver transcriptome to identify known genes, predicted genes and unsequenced transcripts expressed and regulated during an acute toxicological response. First, we describe how the universal microarray produces <b>tag</b> <b>sequences</b> from paired cDNA samples. We demonstrate that the <b>tag</b> <b>sequences</b> identify expressed gene predictions and enable sequence confirmation. Then, we compare the relative gene expression of known genes using the universal microarray to published work. We extend known gene profiling on the samples to include genes (1) not represented on a commercially-available dog microarray, or (2) represented in a proprietary dog sequence collection. Finally, we describe how <b>tag</b> <b>sequences</b> not contained within known gene or gene prediction sequence databases can be used as a starting point for targeted gene discovery approaches...|$|R
40|$|Ligating {{adapters}} {{with unique}} synthetic oligonucleotide <b>sequences</b> (<b>sequence</b> <b>tags)</b> onto individual DNA samples before massively parallel sequencing {{is a popular}} and efficient way to obtain sequence data from many individual samples. <b>Tag</b> <b>sequences</b> should be numerous and sufficiently different to ensure sequencing, replication, and oligonucleotide synthesis errors do not cause tags to be unrecoverable or confused. However, many design approaches only protect against substitution errors during <b>sequencing</b> and extant <b>tag</b> sets contain too few <b>tag</b> <b>sequences.</b> We developed an open-source software package to validate <b>sequence</b> <b>tags</b> for conformance to two distance metrics and design <b>sequence</b> <b>tags</b> robust to indel and substitution errors. We use this software package to evaluate several commercial and non-commercial <b>sequence</b> <b>tag</b> sets, design several large sets (max(count)  =  7, 198) of edit metric <b>sequence</b> <b>tags</b> having different lengths and degrees of error correction, and integrate a subset of these edit metric tags to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers and sequencing adapters. We validate a subset of these edit metric tagged PCR primers and sequencing adapters by sequencing on several platforms and subsequent comparison to commercially available alternatives. We find that several commonly used sets of <b>sequence</b> <b>tags</b> or design methodologies used to produce <b>sequence</b> <b>tags</b> {{do not meet the}} minimum expectations of their underlying distance metric, and we find that PCR primers and sequencing adapters incorporating edit metric <b>sequence</b> <b>tags</b> designed by our software package perform as well as their commercial counterparts. We suggest that researchers evaluate <b>sequence</b> <b>tags</b> prior to use or evaluate tags that they have been using. The <b>sequence</b> <b>tag</b> sets we design improve on extant sets because they are large, valid across the set, and robust to the suite of substitution, insertion, and deletion errors affecting massively parallel sequencing workflows on all currently used platforms...|$|R
25|$|Each duplex {{sequencing}} read {{contains a}} fixed 5-nucleotide sequence (shown in figures in Black color) located upstream of the 12-nucleotide <b>tag</b> <b>sequence.</b> The reads are filtered {{out if they}} do not have the expected 5-nucleotide sequence or have more than nine identical or ambiguous bases within each tag. The two 12-nucleotide tags at each end of reads are combined and moved to the read header. Two families of reads are formed that originate from the two strands of DNA. One family contains reads with αβ header originating from strand 1 and the second family contains reads with βα header originating from strand 2 (Figure 2). Then the reads are trimmed by removing the fixed 5 bp sequence and 4 error prone nucleotides located at the sites of ligation and end repair. The remaining reads are assembled to consensus sequences using single strand consensus sequences (SSCSs) assembly and duplex consensus sequences (DCSs) assembly.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} step of duplex {{sequencing}} library preparation, Illumina sequencing adapters {{are added to the}} tagged double stranded libraries by PCR amplification using primers containing sequencing adapters. During PCR amplification both complementary strands of DNA are amplified and generate two types of PCR products. Product 1 derive from strand 1 which have a unique <b>tag</b> <b>sequence</b> (called α in the figure 2) next to the Illumina adapter 1 and product 2 that have a unique tag (called β in the figure 2) next to illumina adapter 1. (Please note that in each strand, tag a is the retrograde, complementary version of tag b and vice versa). The libraries containing duplex tags and Illumina adapters are sequenced using Illumina TruSeq system. Reads that are originating from each single strand of DNA form a group of reads (tag families) that are sharing the same tag. The detected families of reads will be used in next step for analyzing sequencing data.|$|E

50|$|There are two {{advantages}} {{by using}} transposon tagging. First, if a transposon is inserted into a gene sequence, this insertion is single and intact. The intactness can make <b>tagged</b> <b>sequence</b> easily to molecular analysis. The other advantage is that, many transposons {{can be found}} eliminated from <b>tagged</b> gene <b>sequence</b> when transposase is analyzed. This provides confirmation that the inserted gene <b>sequence</b> was really <b>tagged</b> by transposon.|$|R
2500|$|Coding by tmRNA was {{discovered}} in 1995 when Simpson and coworkers overexpressed the mouse cytokine IL-6 in E. coli and found multiple truncated cytokine-derived peptides each tagged at the carboxyl termini with the same 11-amino acid residue extension (A)ANDENYALAA. With {{the exception of the}} N-terminal alanine, which comes from the 3' end of tmRNA itself, this <b>tag</b> <b>sequence</b> [...] was traced to a short open reading frame in E. coli tmRNA. Recognizing that the tag peptide confers proteolysis, the trans-translation model for tmRNA action was proposed.|$|E

50|$|Once RAD tags {{have been}} isolated, {{they can be}} used to {{identify}} and genotype DNA sequence polymorphisms such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These polymorphic sites are referred to as RAD markers. The most efficient way to find RAD tags is by high-throughput DNA <b>sequencing,</b> called RAD <b>tag</b> <b>sequencing,</b> RAD sequencing, RAD-Seq, or RADSeq.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a very simple, yet effective, approach to cross language adaptation of dependency parsers. We first remove lexical {{items from the}} treebanks and map part-of-speech tags into a common tagset. We then train a language model on <b>tag</b> <b>sequences</b> in otherwise unlabeled target data and rank labeled source data by perplexity per word of <b>tag</b> <b>sequences</b> from less similar to most similar to the target. We then train our target language parser on the most similar data points in the source labeled data. The strategy achieves much better results than a non-adapted baseline and stateof-the-art unsupervised dependency parsing, and results are comparable to more complex projection-based cross language adaptation algorithms. ...|$|R

50|$|The factor Xa {{protease}} {{can be used}} in biochemistry to cleave off protein tags {{that improve}} expression or purification of a protein of interest. Its preferred cleavage site (after the arginine in the sequence Ile-Glu/Asp-Gly-Arg, IEGR or IDGR) can easily be engineered between a <b>tag</b> <b>sequence</b> and the protein of interest. After expression and purification, the tag is then proteolytically removed by factor Xa.|$|E
50|$|In the in situ method, protein {{synthesis}} {{is carried out}} on a protein array surface that is pre-coated with a protein-capturing reagent or antibody. Once the newly synthesized proteins are released from the ribosome, the <b>tag</b> <b>sequence</b> that is also synthesized at the N- or C-terminus of each nascent protein will be bound by the capture reagent or antibody, thus immobilizing the proteins to form an array. Commonly used tags include polyhistidine (His)6 and glutathione s-transferase (GST).|$|E
5000|$|Recent use of {{high-throughput}} sequencing techniques, {{pioneered by}} Dr. Mitchell Sogin of the Marine Biological Laboratory, has broadened {{the scope of}} biodiversity, {{with the discovery of}} the rare biosphere. Previous attempts to characterize in situ abundance have been made through pure culture and molecular techniques. Pure culture providing a very narrow picture of some of the rarer species present, <1-5% of bacteria present. Molecular techniques, such as Sanger sequencing, resulting in a much broader scope but highlighting the more abundant species present. Neither technique captures all of the diversity present. Alternatively high throughput sequencing, “tag sequencing”, divides unique rRNA <b>tag</b> <b>sequences</b> into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based upon similarities in mitochondrial-encoded cytochrome oxidases. Both Sanger, shot gun <b>sequencing,</b> and <b>tag</b> <b>sequencing</b> organize sequences into OTUs. However, it is the resolution that <b>tag</b> <b>sequencing</b> provides that sets it apart, resulting from the increased efficiency in serial analysis. This efficiency increase is made possible through the use of internal primer sequences resulting in restriction digest overhanging sequences. [...] Though OTUs provide a means of distinguishing the possible number of phylogenetic groups, {{it is not possible to}} deduce phylogenetic relationships based upon OTU’s. Tags associated with OTUs must be cross-referenced with gene banks, in order for tags to be phylotyped and relationships established.|$|R
40|$|Social {{annotation}} is an intuitive, on-line, {{collaborative process}} through which each element {{of a collection of}} resources (e. g., URLs, pictures, videos, etc.) is associated with a group of descriptive keywords, widely known as tags. Each such group is a concise and accurate summary of the relevant resource’s content and is obtained via aggregating the opinion of individual users, as expressed in the form of short <b>tag</b> <b>sequences.</b> The availability of this information gives rise to a new searching paradigm where resources are retrieved and ranked based on the similarity of a keyword query to their accompanying tags. In this paper, we present a principled and efficient search and resource ranking methodology that utilizes exclusively the userassigned <b>tag</b> <b>sequences.</b> Ranking is based on solid probabilistic foundations and our growing understanding of the dynamics and structure of the social annotation process, which we capture by employing powerful interpolated n-gram models on the <b>tag</b> <b>sequences.</b> The efficiency and applicability of the proposed solution to large data sets is guaranteed through the introduction of a novel and highly scalable constrained optimization framework, employed both for training and incrementally maintaining the n-gram models. We experimentally validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our solutions compared to other applicable approaches. Our evaluation is based on a large crawl of del. icio. us, numbering hundreds of thousands of users and millions of resources, thus demonstrating the applicability of our solutions to real-life, large scale systems. In particular, we demonstrate that the use of interpolated n-grams for modeling <b>tag</b> <b>sequences</b> results in superior ranking effectiveness, while the proposed optimization framework is superior in terms of performance both for obtaining ranking parameters and incrementally maintaining them. 1...|$|R

50|$|While {{this problem}} can be solved by simply {{performing}} classification of individual tokens, that approach {{does not take into}} account the empirical fact that tags do not occur independently; instead, each tag displays a strong conditional dependence on the tag of the previous word.

50|$|The longer <b>tag</b> <b>sequence</b> confers {{a higher}} {{specificity}} than the classical SAGE tag of 9-10 bp.

A significant advantage is the larger library size compared with SAGE. An MPSS library typically holds 1 million signature tags, which is roughly 20 times the size of a SAGE library. Some of the disadvantages related to SAGE apply to MPSS as well, such as loss of certain transcripts due to lack of restriction enzyme recognition site and ambiguity in tag annotation. The high sensitivity and absolute gene expression certainly favors MPSS. However, the technology is only available through Lynxgen Therapeutics, Inc.

However, fluorescence scanning displayed no fluorescence labelling, i.e. no formylglycine formation by endogenous FGE in CHO cells.
