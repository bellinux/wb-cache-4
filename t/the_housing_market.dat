40|$|Research {{on social}} {{exclusion}} {{has focused on}} the labour markets and on social networks. Relatively little is yet known about social exclusion in <b>the</b> realm of <b>housing.</b> Valuable empirical studies on homelessness and on extreme manifestations of socio-spatial segregation put the emphasis on the results of processes of social exclusion in <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>markets.</b> By contrast, research has seldom analysed the process of social exclusion itself, in particular in a comparative perspective. Such an approach would require <b>the</b> analysis of <b>housing</b> biographies that are defined as the sequence of dwellings a household occupies during life. Consequently, HASEC defines social exclusion in <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>markets</b> as a procedural phenomenon. We examine housing biographies of individuals and evaluate the direction of their development. Exclusion in <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>markets</b> is thus understood as a process of deterioration of <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> conditions (in terms of dwelling size, housing quality, neighbourhood conditions) during housing biographies. Furthermore, exclusion is structured, since <b>the</b> direction of <b>housing</b> biographies depends on the interference of macrostructural and individual factors.

25|$|A {{substantial}} {{percentage of}} the US homeless population are individuals who are chronically unemployed or have difficulty managing their lives effectively due to prolonged and severe drug and/or alcohol abuse. Substance abuse can cause homelessness from behavioral patterns associated with addiction that alienate an addicted individual's family and friends who could otherwise provide support during difficult economic times. Increased wealth disparity and income inequality causes distortions in <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>market</b> that push rent burdens higher, making housing unaffordable. Dr. Paul Koegel of RAND Corporation, a seminal researcher in first generation homelessness studies and beyond, divided the causes of homelessness into structural aspects and then individual vulnerabilities.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s, {{an influx}} of hippie {{subculture}} began to take root in {{the city in the}} wake of San Francisco's burgeoning countercultural scene. The city's Crystal Ballroom became a hub for the city's psychedelic culture, while food cooperatives and listener-funded media and radio stations were established. A large social activist presence evolved during this time as well, specifically concerning Native American rights, environmentalist causes, and gay rights. By the 1970s, Portland had well established itself as a progressive city, and experienced an economic boom {{for the majority of the}} decade; however, the slowing of <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>market</b> in 1979 caused demand for the city and state timber industries to drop significantly.|$|E

40|$|The latest global {{financial}} tsunami and its follow-up global economic recession has uncovered the crucial impact of <b>housing</b> <b>markets</b> on financial and economic systems. The Chinese stock market experienced a markedly fall during the {{global financial}} tsunami and China's economy has also slowed down by about 2 %- 3 % when measured in GDP. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>markets</b> in diverse Chinese cities seemed to continue the almost nonstop mania {{for more than ten}} years. However, the structure and dynamics of <b>the</b> Chinese <b>housing</b> <b>market</b> are less studied. Here we perform an extensive study of <b>the</b> Chinese <b>housing</b> <b>market</b> by analyzing ten representative key cities based on both linear and nonlinear econophysical and econometric methods.

40|$|Both {{the public}} and the European Commission have criticized the past actions of Dutch housing {{associations}}. A new housing act has become applicable, which would force housing associations to change their conduct on <b>the</b> rental <b>housing</b> <b>market.</b> Important developments include the allocation of households with a low income to social dwellings, a distinction between the social and commercial rental market, and lastly, a landlord levy.

The model was made for one specific housing association: Havensteder, a large <b>housing</b> association in <b>the</b> region of Rotterdam. The position of Havensteder and some objectives are taken into consideration for the system dynamics model.

40|$|This {{research}} project purports {{to offer a}} comprehensive analysis of how the legal framework in Saudi Arabia might be improved to further the development and efficacy of <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> finance <b>market.</b> <b>The</b> research aims to achieve the following objectives: enhancing {{the efficiency of the}} main participants, lender and borrower, in <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> finance <b>market</b> by providing them with the desired protection; facilitating access to that market; building up a proper regulatory framework for governing the market; and finally, addressing the legal barriers that hinder the provision of cheap liquidity in <b>the</b> <b>market.</b> Although <b>the</b> <b>Housing</b> Finance Laws (HFLs) 2012 were introduced and enacted with similar objectives in mind, this thesis argues that four issues still present significant obstacles to the development of <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> finance <b>market,</b> albeit some are a result of the provisions of the HFLs themselves. As a consequence, the thesis has sought to address the following questions; what barriers to the development of <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> finance remain unaddressed? How should Saudi law be reformed to provide adequate protection for lender and borrower in the market? Can the Land Fees Law 2016 {{play a critical role in}} addressing the current issue of increasing land prices which hinders access to <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> finance <b>market?</b> How can the regulatory framework for regulating <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> finance <b>market</b> in general, and for adopting the macro-prudential policy in particular, be developed to achieve the HFLs’ aims? And, finally, how might Saudi laws be reformed to enable the launch of a securitisation market, in order to assist in the development of <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> finance <b>market</b> by providing new means of liquidity? It is hoped that critical analysis of the above questions will help to facilitate development of <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> finance <b>market</b> and contribute to its further improvement, by addressing potentially workable solutions to the obstacles listed above. ...|$|R
