5|$|Some {{research}} suggests that cranberry (juice or capsules) may decrease the number of UTIs in those with frequent infections. A Cochrane review concluded that the benefit, if it exists, is small. Long-term tolerance is also an issue with gastrointestinal upset occurring in more than 30%. Cranberry juice is thus not currently recommended for this indication. As of 2015, probiotics require further study <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are beneficial.|$|E
5|$|To use Lorenz, a {{conventional}} radio was {{tuned to the}} transmission, and the operator would listen for the signal and try <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> heard dots or dashes. If they heard dots, the short 0.2s pulse, they would know they were {{too far to the}} left, and turned to the right in order to reach the centreline. Dashes indicated they should turn left. In the centre the receiver could hear both signals, which merged to form a steady tone, the equisignal.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of this}} Popular Revolution, Gaddafi invited Libya's {{people to}} found General People's Committees as {{conduits}} for raising political consciousness. Although offering little guidance for {{how to set up}} these councils, Gaddafi claimed that they would offer a form of direct political participation that was more democratic than a traditional party-based representative system. He hoped that the councils would mobilise the people behind the RCC, erode the power of the traditional leaders and the bureaucracy, and allow for a new legal system chosen by the people. Many such committees were established in schools and colleges, where they were responsible for vetting staff, courses, and textbooks <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were compatible with the country's revolutionary ideology.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} other {{experiments}} were to be performed inside the orbiter crew compartment. Among these was the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System, being flown for the fourth time. This separated solutions of biological materials by passing electric fields through them; the experiment aimed at supporting research into diabetes treatments. A small animal cage was flown containing six rats; no animal experiment was carried out on the flight, but a student involvement project was planned for a later mission which would use the cage, and NASA wanted to ensure it was flight-tested. The student involvement project carried out on STS-8 involved William Thornton using biofeedback techniques, to try <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> worked in microgravity. A photography experiment would attempt to study the spectrum of a luminous atmospheric glow which had been reported around the orbiter, and determine how this interacted with firings of the reaction control system.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} many other small {{pharmaceutical}} companies in the United States, Eli Lilly and Company distinguished itself from the others by having a permanent research staff, inventing superior techniques for the mass production of medicinal drugs, and its strong focus on quality. At first, Lilly was the company's only researcher, but as the business grew, he established a research laboratory and employed others who were dedicated to creating new drugs. Lilly hired his first full-time research chemist, Ernest G. Eberhards, and botanist, Walter H. Evans, in 1886. The department's methods of research were based on Lilly's. He insisted on quality assurance and instituted mechanisms {{to ensure that the}} drugs being produced would be effective and perform as advertised, had the correct combination of ingredients, and had the correct dosages of medicines in each pill. He was aware of the addictive and dangerous nature of some of his drugs, and pioneered the concept of giving such drugs only to people who had first seen a physician <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> needed the medicine.|$|E

5000|$|Under Bloomberg, Commissioner Kelly also revamped New York City's Police Department into a {{world-class}} counter-terrorism operation, operating {{in conjunction with}} the CIA. Prior to the September 11, 2001 attacks there were fewer than two dozen officers working on terrorism full time; ten years later there were over 1,000. One of Kelly's innovations was his unprecedented stationing of New York City police detectives in other cities throughout the world following terrorist attacks in those cities, with a view <b>to</b> <b>determining</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are in any way connected to the security of New York. In the cases of both the March 11, 2004, Madrid bombing and the July 7, 2005 London bombings and July 21, 2005 London bombings, NYPD detectives were on the scene within a day to relay pertinent information back to New York. An August 2011 article by the Associated Press reported the NYCPD's extensive use of undercover agents (colloquially referred to as “rakers” and “mosque crawlers”) to keep tabs, even build databases, on stores, restaurants, mosques. and clubs. NYPD spokesman Paul Browne denied that police trawled ethnic neighborhoods, telling the AP that officers only follow leads. He also dismissed the idea of “mosque crawlers,” saying, [...] "Someone has a great imagination." ...|$|R
5|$|Initial {{results were}} {{surprising}} as the material excavated {{by the impact}} contained more dust and less ice than had been expected. The only models of cometary structure astronomers could positively rule out were the very porous ones which had comets as loose aggregates of material. In addition, the material was finer than expected; scientists compared it to talcum powder rather than sand. Other materials found while studying the impact included clays, carbonates, sodium, and crystalline silicates which were found by studying the spectroscopy of the impact. Clays and carbonates usually require liquid water to form and sodium is rare in space. Observations also revealed that the comet was about 75% empty space, and one astronomer compared the outer layers of the comet to the same makeup of a snow bank. Astronomers have expressed interest in more missions to different comets <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> share similar compositions or if there are different materials found deeper within comets that were produced {{at the time of}} the Solar System's formation.|$|E

50|$|A paceband is a wristband, {{sometimes}} {{made of a}} {{strip of}} waterproof paper, that lists expected split times for a running race. When {{used in conjunction with}} a stopwatch, a paceband can assist athletes in maintaining a steady pace throughout the race. This is the most efficient racing pace from a cardiovascular and muscle energy perspective. Erratic running speeds, particularly the urge to sprint early in a race while feeling fresh, consume energy inefficiently. A glance at the paceband and stopwatch as each distance marker is passed allows the athlete <b>to</b> quickly <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are running too fast for their targeted finishing time or too slowly and adjust accordingly.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Neighbor {{discovery}} {{is an important}} part of many protocols for wireless adhoc networks, including localization and routing. When neighbor discovery fails, communications and protocols performance deteriorate. In networks affected by relay attacks, also known as wormholes, the failure may be more subtle. The wormhole may selectively deny or degrade communications. In this paper we present Mobile Secure Neighbor Discovery (MSND), which offers a measure of protection against wormholes by allowing participating mobile nodes <b>to</b> securely <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are neighbors. <b>To</b> the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to secure neighbor discovery in mobile adhoc networks.

Meandric permutations are useful {{in the analysis of}} RNA secondary structure. Not all alternate permutations are meandric. A modification of Heap's algorithm has been used to generate all alternate permutations of order n (that is, of length 2n) without generating all (2n)! permutations. Generation of these alternate permutations is needed before they are analyzed <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are meandric or not.|$|E

25|$|Six {{isolated}} {{permanent teeth}} were found. They consisted of an upper lateral incisor, upper third premolar, upper fourth premolar, upper first molar, and an upper second molar, {{as well as}} 121 cranial fragments. All of the teeth found had complete crowns with developed roots. The varying size of the roots in each tooth make it difficult <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are damaged, or the length they are because of development. It was determined {{that all of the}} pieces belonged to a 9-12-year-old juvenile. The sex of this particular fossil remains unknown. The teeth found have Neanderthal features, as some of them show Taurodontism, which is primarily found in the Neanderthal morphology. Studies of the pieces of cranium found are more ambiguous and harder to link to Neanderthals. The Parietal bone has a stronger likeness to anatomically modern humans, while other bones of the skull can be linked to Neanderthal craniums. Most researchers believe that this particular fossil is a Neanderthal because of the analysis of its dentition.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{investigative tool}} at the player's disposal is the Voight-Kampff machine, which tests people <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are replicants. Usually, Voight-Kampff tests are automatically triggered at certain predetermined {{points in the}} game, although on occasion, the player has the option of administering a test. The test depicts a close-up of the subject's eye, and features three needles. The further the top needle moves to the right, the more likely the subject is a replicant; the further the bottom needle moves to the right, {{the more likely they}} are human. The third needle is on a sweeping axis and measures the intensity of the questions (for every question the player can choose low, medium or high intensity), and the pressure felt by the subject. If the player pushes the subject too far, by asking too many high intensity questions, the test will end before a definite result can be obtained. If the player determines with certainty whether a subject is or is not a replicant, the test ends automatically. The player must then decide what course of action to take, with the decision influencing the rest of the storyline; for example, if a subject tests positive as a replicant, the player can kill them, attempt to arrest them, or let them go.|$|E

40|$|Hereditary diffuse {{leukoencephalopathy}} with spheroids (HDLS) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal dominant}} disorder characterized by cerebral white matter degeneration with myelin loss and axonal swellings (spheroids) leading to progressive cognitive and motor dysfunction. Histopathology of HDLS has been well characterized, but ultrastructural details are lacking. Here we report ultrastructural and immunoelectron microscopic characterization of spheroids and capillary basal lamina in white matter of HDLS brains. Spheroids had thin or discontinuous or no myelin sheaths. They contained various combinations of aggregated neurofilaments (NF), cytoplasmic organelles, dense bodies, and laminated figures. Aggregated filaments labeled with antibodies to phosphorylated NF (pNF), non-pNF and amyloid precursor protein. The gliotic white matter had many reactive astrocytes, and lipid-laden macrophages with membranous and fingerprint-like bodies. The basal laminas (BL) of many capillaries were dilated, and the enlarged space was heavily deposited with banded collagen type I and III. Some BL had focal thickenings and duplications. Fibronectin, not collagen IV, was found associated with banded collagen. The various types of axonal spheroids and changes in capillary basal lamina have not been emphasized previously.
