5|$|Wasting no time, Trish evacuates the innocents of Fortuna, while Dante stays busy {{destroying}} the false Hell Gates which brought the demon army, reclaiming Yamato after defeating Agnus, and finally going head-to-head with <b>The</b> <b>Savior</b> in an epic sky battle above Fortuna, as Sanctus controls it from within. With Nero still captured inside <b>The</b> <b>Savior,</b> Dante {{is able to}} drive Yamato through The Savior’s chest, freeing Nero, who reclaims it inside. In a final battle inside <b>The</b> <b>Savior,</b> Nero destroys Sanctus and saves Kyrie. Though still {{coming to terms with}} his as-of-yet unclear ties to the Sparda bloodline, Nero is finally able to make peace with it, after acknowledging the power it has given him to protect those he cares about.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of four hours, a series of blunders in {{planning}} and communication had caused Lee's forces to launch three failed frontal infantry assaults across hundreds of yards of open ground, unsupported by Confederate artillery, charging toward firmly entrenched Union infantry and artillery defenses. These errors provided Union forces {{with an opportunity to}} inflict heavy casualties. In the aftermath of the battle, however, the Confederate press heralded Lee as <b>the</b> <b>savior</b> of Richmond. In stark contrast, McClellan was accused of being absent from the battlefield, a harsh criticism that haunted him when he ran for president in 1864.|$|E
5|$|The Order of the	White Shrine of Jerusalem Like {{the members}} of the Masonic Lodge and other {{appendant}} bodies, members of the White Shrine must profess a belief in a Supreme Being. However, the White Shrine goes one step further, requiring members to profess a belief in Jesus Christ as <b>the</b> <b>Savior</b> and Redeemer of the World. Membership is open to female relatives of Master Masons or members either active for three years or majority of the International Order of Rainbow for Girls or Job's Daughters International who have attained of eighteen (18) years of age.|$|E
50|$|Rick {{and crew}} confront the Hilltop Colony's enemy, <b>the</b> <b>Saviors.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Saviors</b> are a brutal gang {{led by a}} man named Negan. Rick {{underestimates}} <b>the</b> <b>Saviors</b> and dismisses their threat level until his best friends, including Glenn and Abraham, are brutally killed. Alexandria is forced to begin paying tribute - half of their supplies - to <b>the</b> <b>Saviors.</b> Enraged, Rick vows to kill Negan.|$|R
50|$|Ezekiel brings Morgan and Benjamin to {{a secret}} meeting with <b>the</b> <b>Saviors,</b> who are given the walker-fed pigs, now slaughtered, {{as part of their}} tribute from the Kingdom. One of <b>the</b> <b>Saviors,</b> Jared, tells Richard <b>the</b> <b>Saviors</b> are letting <b>the</b> Kingdom off easy by taking only eight pigs, to which Richard replies that <b>the</b> <b>Saviors</b> are <b>the</b> ones being let off easy. Jared attacks Richard and Ezekiel makes them break up the fight. The leader of <b>the</b> <b>Saviors</b> group tells Jared to stop only after Jared has hit Richard a few times. <b>The</b> <b>Saviors</b> leave and say they will want produce next time, or Richard {{will be the first to}} die. Later, Benjamin tells Morgan his father was killed and that the Kingdom obeys <b>the</b> <b>Saviors</b> because they think they would never be able to defeat them.|$|R
5000|$|After Gregory is stabilized, Jesus {{explains}} that Negan {{is the head}} of a group called <b>the</b> <b>Saviors.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Saviors</b> came to <b>the</b> Hilltop, issuing a lot of demands and even more threats, resulting in a deal: half of the Hilltop's supplies, crops and livestock goes to <b>the</b> <b>Saviors</b> in exchange for peace. Daryl and Abraham say they were unimpressed by <b>the</b> <b>Saviors</b> they had killed, and Daryl offers to kill Negan, take out his boys and rescue the hostage in exchange for food, medicine and [...] "one of them cows." [...] Maggie closes the deal with Gregory, demanding half of everything from the Hilltop in advance.|$|R
5|$|In Luxerion, Lightning investigates {{a series}} of murders where all the victims match the {{physical}} description of <b>the</b> <b>savior.</b> During her journey, she is followed by Noel, who has become obsessed with a prophecy that he must kill Lightning to realize a better world and reunite with Yeul. The two briefly ally to rout the Children of Etro, responsible for the murders, then later do battle. Lightning uses Noel's rage to make him realize and accept his mistakes, lifting his burden. After this, she meets up with Vanille in the Order's cathedral. Vanille shows Lightning a place within the cathedral where {{the souls of the}} dead have gathered. Vanille is being prepared for a ritual to take place on the final day that will apparently purify the souls. She hopes to atone for past actions by doing so.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{presented}} {{as the primary}} antagonist who he must capture, Nero’s encounters with Dante {{over the course of}} the game reveal that the Order of the Sword is in fact responsible for a number of atrocities. Chief among them, is the Order's High-Ranking Scientist Agnus, who has succeeded in transforming himself, Credo, and a very-much-alive Sanctus into Demons with incredible power by siphoning demonic energy from Yamato, the long lost Devil Arm of Dante's twin brother Vergil. Furthermore, Sanctus has used Agnus' research to summon an army of demons to attack Fortuna, while simultaneously awakening a long dormant weapon called <b>The</b> <b>Savior</b> (a giant colossus made in Sparda's image) to destroy the threat; posing as the second coming of Sparda in order to eliminate non-believers, and strengthen his congregation’s worship.|$|E
5|$|Scully goes to Agent Robert Comer, {{whom she}} was forced to shoot after his attempt on William's life, and uses the alien {{artifact}} to heal him. Comer explains that Josepho believes a physical manifestation of God exists inside the spacecraft. According to an ancient prophecy, William is destined to become <b>the</b> <b>savior</b> of humanity, but only if Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is still alive. If he dies, William will instead lead the Colonists. Comer claims that Mulder was supposedly killed by the cult in order for the aliens to successfully invade; he tried to kill William to prevent him from causing humanity's destruction. Suddenly, a nurse and the Toothpick Man (Alan Dale) arrive and ask Reyes and Scully to leave. Comer ends up alone with the Toothpick Man.|$|E
50|$|Rick calls {{a meeting}} and lays out the deal with the Hilltop and {{explains}} how <b>the</b> <b>Saviors</b> nearly killed Sasha, Abraham and Daryl, and {{it would only be}} {{a matter of time before}} they found Alexandria. Morgan proposes that stating their willingness to fight might be enough to stop <b>the</b> <b>Saviors,</b> but Rick disagrees and won't give up the initiative, preferring to make a pre-emptive sneak attack against <b>the</b> <b>Saviors</b> and kill them all.|$|R
5000|$|At {{some point}} after the outbreak, Negan is found {{by a group}} led {{by a man named}} Dwight. He slowly took control over this group from Dwight, thus forming <b>The</b> <b>Saviors</b> and {{fiercely}} ruled over his group. Negan, along with his team (which includes at least 50 or more other men), had made a deal with the Hilltop Colony: <b>the</b> <b>Saviors</b> would use <b>the</b> weaponry the other group was lacking to kill all zombies wandering near the Hilltop's premises. In return, <b>the</b> <b>Saviors</b> would obtain half of Hilltop's supplies, such as livestock and crops. To get his point across, if a potential problem would arise, Negan and his men would resort to cruel measures. For example, if they sensed they were being tracked, or if they believed they weren't getting sufficient supplies, <b>the</b> <b>Saviors</b> beat or killed people from Hilltop. <b>The</b> <b>Saviors</b> also sent [...] "messages" [...] to the Hilltop community, which were usually very deadly, such as Ethan having to kill Gregory.|$|R
50|$|Rick's band learns what {{living under}} Negan's rules really means. Rick devises a new {{strategy}} to deal with <b>the</b> <b>Saviors,</b> but {{a member of his}} group disappears after <b>the</b> <b>Saviors</b> collect their payment from Alexandria. Rick is forced to halt his plan. Paul takes Rick to request help from an exotic man named Ezekiel, leader of a community called the Kingdom. The Kingdom is based in Washington, D.C., where one of <b>the</b> <b>Saviors</b> makes an independent offer to help battle Negan.|$|R
5|$|The {{origin of}} the badnjak is {{explained}} by the events surrounding the Nativity of Jesus Christ. According to the Gospel of Luke , Mary Theotokos gave birth to Christ at Bethlehem, wrapped him in cloths and laid him in a manger. By Holy Tradition, the manger was located in a cave near that town. An angel of the Lord appeared {{to a group of}} shepherds who were keeping watch over their flock by night in that region, and told them that <b>the</b> <b>Savior</b> was born at Bethlehem. They went there and found the baby lying in the manger, as the angel described to them. By folk tradition, the shepherds brought firewood to the cave and built a fire to warm the newborn Christ and his mother throughout the night. The burning of the badnjak commemorates this event.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the {{investigations}} of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Scully, distrustful of both Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Brad Follmer (Cary Elwes), circumvents the FBI's investigation into William's kidnapping and performs her own, assisted by Reyes and The Lone Gunmen. Scully discovers that William has been taken by a UFO cult that believes William is destined to become <b>the</b> <b>savior</b> of mankind, but only if Fox Mulder is still alive. If Mulder is dead, William will lead the forces of evil: the alien invaders.|$|E
5|$|Despite Isabeau's {{efforts to}} keep the peace, the Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War broke out in 1411. John gained the upper hand during the first year, but the Dauphin began to build a power base; Christine de Pizan wrote of {{him that he was}} <b>the</b> <b>savior</b> of France. Still only 15, he lacked the power or backing to defeat John, who fomented revolt in Paris. In {{retaliation}} against John the Fearless' actions, Charles of Orléans denied funds from the royal treasury to all members of the royal family. In 1414, instead of allowing her son, then 17, to lead, Isabeau allied herself with Charles of Orléans. The Dauphin, in return, changed allegiance and joined John, which Isabeau considered unwise and dangerous. The result was continued civil war in Paris. Parisian commoners joined forces with John the Fearless in the Cabochien Revolt, and {{at the height of the}} revolt a group of butchers entered Isabeau's home in search of traitors, arresting and taking away up to 15 of her ladies-in-waiting. In his chronicles Pintoin wrote that Isabeau was firmly allied with the Orléanists and the 60,000 Armagnacs who invaded Paris and Picardy.|$|E
50|$|Outside {{the walls}} of the Kingdom, Richard and Daryl hide behind an 18-wheel cargo on the highway. Describing his plan to incite war with <b>the</b> <b>Saviors,</b> Richard tells Daryl that he intends to ambush them on <b>the</b> road; <b>the</b> <b>Saviors</b> that {{discover}} <b>the</b> brutal scene will follow a trail to a weapons cache he planted at the cottage occupied by Carol (Melissa McBride). He expects <b>the</b> <b>Saviors</b> will kill Carol, who Ezekiel cares for, thus pushing and motivating the King towards war. As <b>the</b> <b>Saviors</b> drive by, Daryl wrestles and beats Richard to the ground to keep him from enacting his plan. Daryl refuses to help Richard at Carol's expense and vows to kill him if she gets hurt in any way.|$|R

50|$|After Rick Grimes and {{his fellow}} {{survivors}} agree to begin a trading relationship with the Hilltop Colony, they are ambushed by <b>the</b> <b>Saviors</b> and are forced to obey Negan's orders to give <b>the</b> <b>Saviors</b> half of their supplies, as the other communities do. Initially obedient, Rick and the others secretly conspire with other communities in the Washington, D.C. area to prepare for war against <b>the</b> <b>Saviors.</b> Negan resides in an abandoned factory, {{where most of the}} attractive women—formerly other men's girlfriends or wives—act as his wives. He soon grows fond of Rick's son, Carl Grimes.|$|R
5|$|Nafaryus hears a rumor about Gabriel being <b>the</b> <b>savior</b> of the people. He and {{his family}} travel to Ravenskill to see him for {{themselves}} ("Lord Nafaryus"). In the Ravenskill town square, Gabriel is performing for the people when the royal family shows up. He continues playing at the emperor's request ("A Savior in the Square"), nearly bringing them all to tears ("When Your Time Has Come"). As he plays, Faythe remembers how she found a music player {{when she was a}} child and kept it a secret all her life, and as she and Gabriel stare at each other and fall in love ("Act of Faythe"). Nafaryus, though briefly moved by Gabriel's song, sees him as a threat to his rule and gives the people of the town three days to deliver their savior to him or he will destroy the town ("Three Days"). Arhys hides his brother and refuses to give him up ("Brother, Can You Hear Me?").|$|E
5|$|In , Lightning is revived after 500 {{years by}} the god Bhunivelze. The world is set to end in {{thirteen}} days, and Lightning is chosen as <b>the</b> <b>Savior,</b> a spiritual guide for humanity, which has ceased to age due {{to the influence of}} chaos. In return for Lightning's help, Serah will be resurrected. Aided by Hope, Lightning frees her former allies of emotional burdens, reunites with Odin {{in the form of a}} white Chocobo, and frequently crosses paths with Lumina, the physical manifestation of Lightning's suppressed vulnerabilities. Lightning begins to doubt her humanity, and, when she learns that Bhunivelze stole Serah's soul and manipulated Lightning's memories, she plans to betray him after he has finished building the new world. When the end of the world arrives, Lightning fights Bhunivelze, who wants to transform humanity into his ideal image and has been shaping Lightning as Etro's replacement. Although she is prepared to fulfill her new role and abandon her human life, Lightning instead chooses to call for help and to accept Lumina as a part of herself. Everyone she has saved, including Serah, unites with her and defeats Bhunivelze. Lightning then witnesses the creation of a new universe, into which she goes with her allies and the souls of humanity. In the epilogue, she is seen traveling to reunite with one of her friends.|$|E
