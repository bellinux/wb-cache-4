Following the match, in a live interview with Danish Eurosport 2, Midtjylland sporting director Claus Steinlein denied any ongoing negotiations, stating that Midtjylland {{would not be able to}} live up to Van der Vaart's economic demands. Just four days later, however, ahead of the 2016–17 UEFA Europa League third round qualifying match against Videoton, Steinlein confirmed that the club was in fact <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> a deal to bring in Van der Vaart.|$|E

25|$|The {{second of}} Hoyle's {{nucleosynthesis}} papers also introduced an interesting {{use of the}} anthropic principle, which was not then known by that name. In <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> the routes of stellar nucleosynthesis, Hoyle calculated that one particular nuclear reaction, the triple-alpha process, which generates carbon from helium, would require the carbon nucleus {{to have a very}} specific resonance energy and spin for it to work. The large amount of carbon in the universe, which makes it possible for carbon-based life-forms of any kind to exist, demonstrated to Hoyle that this nuclear reaction must work. Based on this notion, Hoyle therefore predicted the values of the energy, the nuclear spin and the parity of the compound state in the carbon nucleus formed by three alpha particles, which was later borne out by experiment.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} aspects of The Magician's Nephew {{parallel}} Lewis' own life. Both Digory and Lewis were {{children in the}} early 1900s, both wanted a pony, and both were faced {{with the death of}} their mothers in childhood. Digory is separated from his father, who is in India, and misses him. Lewis was schooled in England after his mother's death, while his father remained in Ireland. He also had a brother in India. Lewis was a voracious reader when a child, Digory is also, and both are better with books than with numbers. Digory (and Polly) struggle with sums when <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> how far they must travel along the attic space to explore an abandoned house, Lewis failed the maths entrance exam for Oxford University. Lewis remembered rainy summer days from his youth and Digory is faced with the same woe in the novel.

500|$|With digital effects work {{running behind}} schedule, Zemeckis {{convinced}} Wes Takahashi, an animation supervisor from visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic, to help work on The Frighteners. [...] "The shots Zemeckis showed me were pretty remarkable," [...] Takahashi reflected, [...] "but {{there were still}} about 400 shots to do, and everyone was kind of worried." [...] Takahashi was quickly drafted as a visual effects supervisor, and began looking at the schedule, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> whether The Frighteners could be finished in time. [...] "There was no way we'd make the deadline. I figured out a concerted plan involving Jackson and Zemeckis to convince Universal it was worthy of asking for more money." [...] The executives at Universal proposed splitting some of the shots to visual effects companies in the United States, but Jackson, for whom the film {{was a chance to}} show New Zealand filmmaking could stand alongside Hollywood, convinced Universal otherwise. Instead, The Frighteners received an accelerated release date, four months earlier than planned, and an additional $6 million in financing, with fifteen digital animators and computer workstations (some were borrowed from Universal and other effects companies in the US). Andrew Adamson was hired as a digital effects supervisor.|$|E

[...] In a separate interview with The Hollywood Reporter Aramayo spoke about auditioning for the role, stating, [...] "The chance to audition to be on the show was a dream, even to audition. It was an absolute dream to me. I was very excited to audition, and landing the role was beyond my wildest dreams. Then when I found out the role was Ned, it was overwhelming." ...|$|E
