5|$|Rhyme {{consists}} of identical ("hard-rhyme") or similar ("soft-rhyme") sounds {{placed at the}} ends of lines or at predictable locations within lines ("internal rhyme"). Languages vary in <b>the</b> <b>richness</b> <b>of</b> their rhyming structures; Italian, for example, has a rich rhyming structure permitting maintenance of a limited set of rhymes throughout a lengthy poem. The richness results from word endings that follow regular forms. English, with its irregular word endings adopted from other languages, is less rich in rhyme. The degree of richness of a language's rhyming structures plays a substantial role in determining what poetic forms are commonly used in that language.|$|E
5|$|The book on Lappland was {{published}} in 1908, with eleven watercolors by Bauer. They were painted in Stockholm, almost 18 months after his visit, using the photos and sketches he had collected during his journey. Many of the photos resulted in other drawings and paintings. Most of these were romanticized versions of the photos, but he succeeded in capturing the nuances and ambiance of the goahtis, and <b>the</b> <b>richness</b> <b>of</b> the Sami garments and crafts. Details from the Sami culture, such as the bent knives, shoes, spears, pots and belts, became important elements in the clothes and ornamentations of Bauer's trolls.

These include the ceiling at Prestongrange, undertaken in 1581 for Mark Kerr, Commendator of Newbattle, and the long gallery at Pinkie House, painted for Alexander Seaton, Earl of Dunfermline, in 1621. These were undertaken by unnamed Scottish artists using continental pattern books that often led to the incorporation of humanist moral and philosophical symbolism, with elements that call on heraldry, piety, classical myths and allegory.|$|E

5|$|There Geoffrey of Villehardouin {{had entered}} {{the service of a}} local Greek magnate against his rivals, and had gained the {{impression}} that the country was easy to take. When the magnate died, his son broke off the alliance with him, but Villehardouin, learning that the Crusaders under Boniface were besieging the Greek magnate Leo Sgouros in Nauplia and the Acrocorinth in the northwest, set out to seek his aid. Boniface sought to retain him in his own service, but Villehardouin teamed up with his fellow Champenois, Champlitte, whom he enticed with tales of <b>the</b> <b>richness</b> <b>of</b> the land and with a pledge to recognize him as his lord. Boniface finally sanctioned their undertaking, and in charge of around a hundred knights and several soldiers, Champlitte and Villehardouin set out together to conquer the Morea. The towns of Patras and Andravida fell without struggle, and at the latter Champlitte received the homage of the local magnates and people of the Skorta and Mesarea. From there the Franks moved south along the coast, accompanied by a fleet, easily taking the fortress of Pontikon, which they repaired and garrisoned. They bypassed the strong fortress of Arkadia (Kyparissia), and passing through Navarino, arrived at Modon. They repaired the fortress walls, long ago torn down by the Venetians to stop its use as a pirate base, and assaulted the nearby fort of Coron, which fell after a single day, and the town of Kalamata, which surrendered.|$|E

These were undertaken by unnamed Scottish artists using continental pattern books that often led to the incorporation of humanist moral and philosophical symbolism, with elements that call on heraldry, piety, classical myths and allegory. The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent for much of the sixteenth century, but began to flourish after the Reformation. There were anonymous portraits of important individuals, including the Earl of Bothwell (1556) and George, fifth earl of Seaton (c. 1570s). James VI employed two Flemish artists, Arnold Bronckorst in the early 1580s and Adrian Vanson from around 1584 to 1602, who have left us a visual record of the king and major figures at the court. The first significant native artist was George Jamesone of Aberdeen (1589/90-1644), who {{became one of the most}} successful portrait painters of the reign of Charles I and trained the Baroque artist John Michael Wright (1617–94). Many painters of the early part of the eighteenth century remained largely artisans, like the members of the Norie family, James (1684–1757) and his sons, who painted the houses of the peerage with Scottish landscapes that were pastiches of Italian and Dutch landscapes.|$|E

40|$|Many saproxylic {{insects are}} {{threatened}} by extinction, {{and a decline in}} the saproxylic species has been observed since the 1800 s. The loss of areas of old-growth forest, fragmentation and the decline in volume of dead wood in managed boreal forests, have been found as important reasons for the observed decline. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether or not the size of old-growth forest fragments affects <b>the</b> species <b>richness</b> <b>of</b> different saproxylic insect groups, and to find what environmental variables best explain <b>the</b> species <b>richness</b> <b>of</b> these different insect groups. Such information is important for further conservation work. The insects were collected by window traps and by rearing of insects from sporocarps of Fomitopsis pinicola. The collected insects were divided into the different insect groups; saproxylic beetles, fungivorous beetles (a subset of the saproxylic beetles), reared beetles species, parasitoid wasp species and hyperparasitoid wasp species. The parasitoid and hyperparasitoid wasps represented higher trophic level than the other insect groups. The study showed that <b>the</b> species <b>richness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saproxylic insect groups was either the same or higher in the small forest fragments, compared to the large forest fragments. <b>The</b> species <b>richness</b> <b>of</b> each insect groups was best explained by different environmental variables: The number of saproxylic beetle species increased with an increase in volume of dead wood, while at the same time it decreased with an increase in polypore diversity. <b>The</b> species <b>richness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fungivorous beetle subset increased with the polypore hymenophore area. The number of beetle species was highest in the most decomposed sporocarps, compared to the least decomposed ones. <b>The</b> species <b>richness</b> <b>of</b> parasitoid wasps was higher in decomposition class II sporocarps, compared to decomposition class I sporocarps. <b>The</b> species <b>richness</b> <b>of</b> parasitoid wasps also increased with the number of beetles present in the sporocarps. It was concluded that large and continuous old-growth forests should be prioritizes in the conservation of threatened saproxylic insects. Forests with a high diversity of dead wood substrates and wood-decomposing fungi supports a high diversity of saproxylic insects, and should also hold a high value for the conservation of saproxylic insects...|$|R
