Following the performance of [...] "Applause", Gaga appeared in a white jumpsuit and green colored wig which she had introduced during the Artpop era.

In the interest of full disclosure, I wish to inform the committee that I am a principal investigator in a project funded by the National Science Foundation, and in addition to my academic position at MIT, I am affiliated with an asset management company that manages several hedge funds and mutual funds. I believe that establishing the means to measure and monitor systemic risk on an ongoing basis is the single-highest priority for financial regulatory reform, and am grateful for the Committee’s interest in this issue. Even the most cautious policymaker would agree that attempting to eliminate all systemic risk is neither feasible nor desirable—risk is a necessary ingredient to real economic growth. Moreover, individual financial institutions do not have the means or the motivation to address systemic risk themselves. In competing for market share and revenues, each entity will typically take on as much risk as its shareholders will allow, without considering the consequences for th...|$|R
