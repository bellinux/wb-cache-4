5|$|Thirty-six federally {{protected}} animals {{live in the}} park, some of which face grave threats to <b>their</b> <b>survival.</b>|$|E
5|$|What {{makes the}} analogy even {{stronger}} {{is that the}} B lymphocytes {{have to compete with}} each other for signals that promote <b>their</b> <b>survival</b> in the germinal centers.|$|E
5|$|A {{critical}} {{issue is how}} to design protected areas for amphibians which will provide suitable conditions for <b>their</b> <b>survival.</b> Conservation efforts {{through the use of}} protected areas have shown to generally be a temporary solution to population decline and extinction because the amphibians become inbred. It is crucial for most amphibians to maintain a high level of genetic variation through large and more diverse environments.|$|E
60|$|Such is {{the nature}} of the {{evidence}} for savage ideas, and for <b>their</b> <b>survivals</b> in civilisation; and the amount of the evidence is best known to him who has to plod through tracts, histories and missionary reports.|$|R
50|$|Deutsche Mythologie (Teutonic Mythology) is a {{treatise}} on Germanic mythology by Jacob Grimm. First published in Germany in 1835, {{the work is}} an exhaustive treatment of the subject, tracing the mythology and beliefs of the ancient Germanic peoples from their earliest attestations to <b>their</b> <b>survivals</b> in modern traditions, folktales and popular expressions.|$|R
5000|$|Their chief duty is {{to ensure}} <b>their</b> own <b>survival</b> and that of their tribe (in that order).|$|R
5|$|Capybaras are {{hunted for}} their meat and pelts in some areas, and {{otherwise}} killed by humans who see their grazing as competition for livestock. In some areas, they are farmed, {{which has the}} effect of ensuring the wetland habitats are protected. <b>Their</b> <b>survival</b> is aided by their ability to breed rapidly.|$|E
5|$|Feather mites of {{at least}} two species have been found on the storm petrel, with Halipeurus pelagicus {{occurring}} at much higher densities than Philoceanus robertsi. The flea Xenopsylla gratiosa and dermanyssid mites are commonly found, with lower numbers of ticks. These blood-sucking parasites slow the growth rate of nestlings and may affect <b>their</b> <b>survival</b> rate.|$|E
5|$|In a {{laboratory}} experiment, Podisus maculiventris {{was used as}} a predatory threat to female L. decemlineata specimens, resulting in the production of unviable trophic eggs alongside viable ones; this response to a predator ensured that additional food was available for newly hatched offspring in order to increase <b>their</b> <b>survival</b> rate. The same experiment also demonstrated the cannibalism of unhatched eggs by newly hatched L. decemlineata larvae as an anti-predator response.|$|E
50|$|Narrow climatic {{tolerance}} {{in animals}} inhibits animals to adapt because <b>their</b> basic <b>survival</b> needs cannot range in location, temperature or resources.|$|R
25|$|With the {{acquisition}} of English, native language loss is the primary threat to <b>their</b> cultural <b>survival,</b> while neither language is being mastered.|$|R
30|$|This study {{evaluated}} the characteristics and {{outcomes of the}} largest cohort of nonagenarians in ICU published to date and provided data on <b>their</b> long-term <b>survival.</b>|$|R
5|$|Many {{tropical}} {{tree species}} have seeds that are dispersed by ants. Seed dispersal by ants or myrmecochory is widespread and new estimates suggest that nearly 9% of all plant species may have such ant associations. Some plants in fire-prone grassland systems are particularly dependent on ants for <b>their</b> <b>survival</b> and dispersal as the seeds are transported to safety below the ground. Many ant-dispersed seeds have special external structures, elaiosomes, that are sought after by ants as food.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the song the sun slowly rises and the lyrics can be {{interpreted}} as a proclamation of the hope that as the sky clears after a difficult night, all the world's people will rise together to proclaim <b>their</b> <b>survival</b> {{to the sound of the}} church bells.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{defense against}} {{herbivory}} or host-plant resistance (HPR) describes {{a range of}} adaptations evolved by plants which improve <b>their</b> <b>survival</b> and reproduction by reducing the impact of herbivores. Plants can sense being touched, and they can use several strategies to defend against damage caused by herbivores. Many plants produce secondary metabolites, known as allelochemicals, that influence the behavior, growth, or survival of herbivores. These chemical defenses can act as repellents or toxins to herbivores, or reduce plant digestibility.|$|E
50|$|Combatants’ express {{concerns}} that <b>their</b> basic <b>survival</b> depends on joining extremist groups. Hence, combatants are not motivated by ideologies and their primary objective is self-preservation.|$|R
25|$|Many {{carnivorous}} {{plants are}} not strongly competitive {{and rely on}} circumstances to suppress dominating vegetation. Accordingly, some of them rely on fire ecology for <b>their</b> continued <b>survival.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 13 March 1999 - Nottingham Forest keep <b>their</b> faint <b>survival</b> hopes {{alive with}} a 3-1 away win over Wimbledon, only their third league win of the season.|$|R
5|$|West Ham had a poor season which {{involved}} a prolonged battle against relegation. They finally secured <b>their</b> <b>survival</b> with two games remaining by defeating Wigan 3–2. The club {{managed to take}} 35 points from 38 games, seven fewer than the total they had when relegated seven years prior.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{bacteria}} form close spatial {{associations that}} are essential for <b>their</b> <b>survival.</b> One such mutualistic association, called interspecies hydrogen transfer, occurs between clusters of anaerobic bacteria that consume organic acids, such as butyric acid or propionic acid, and produce hydrogen, and methanogenic Archaea that consume hydrogen. The bacteria in this association are unable to consume the organic acids as this reaction produces hydrogen that accumulates in their surroundings. Only the intimate association with the hydrogen-consuming Archaea keeps the hydrogen concentration low enough to allow the bacteria to grow.|$|E
5|$|For {{several weeks}} Lamason {{negotiated}} with the camp authorities to have the airmen transferred to a POW camp, but his requests were denied. At great risk, Lamason secretly got word to the Luftwaffe of the Allied airmen's captivity and, seven days before their scheduled execution, 156 of the 168 prisoners were transferred to Stalag Luft III. Most of the airmen credit <b>their</b> <b>survival</b> at Buchenwald to the leadership and determination of Lamason. After the war, he moved to Dannevirke and became a farmer until his retirement. During the 1980s and 1990s, he was a regular speaker at KLB Club and POW reunions.|$|E
50|$|By {{utilizing}} the primary forest, milpas, acahuales and aquatic areas, the Lacandón {{have been able}} to provide a healthy diet for themselves which has contributed to <b>their</b> ongoing <b>survival.</b>|$|R
50|$|Believing {{that they}} will soon be rescued, they begin <b>their</b> new <b>survival</b> adventure. But no help comes. And as they explore the island, they {{encounter}} one strange incident after another.|$|R
50|$|Advocacy - The Center envisions {{becoming}} {{a voice for}} elephants nationally and internationally through advocacy and collaboration that will speak up for elephants on issues that affect <b>their</b> continued <b>survival.</b>|$|R
5|$|In July 1942, the Germans ordered Gens {{to give up}} 500 {{children}} and old people, but by late July he had persuaded the Germans to abandon the order for children to be surrendered. He reduced the entire command to 100 older residents, and on 26 July handed over 84 elderly, mostly terminally ill or disabled, who were then executed by the Nazis. The Jewish administration employed over 1500 people in September 1942, including some intellectuals who were appointed to jobs to ensure <b>their</b> <b>survival.</b> This suggestion was made by community leaders and approved by Gens.|$|E
5|$|In October 1915 {{pack ice}} in the Weddell Sea had sunk Endurance, leaving Shackleton and his companions adrift on a {{precarious}} ice surface. Throughout the duration of <b>their</b> <b>survival,</b> the group drifted northward until April 1916, when the floe on which they had encamped broke up. They then made their way in the ship's lifeboats to Elephant Island, where Shackleton decided that {{the most effective means}} of obtaining rescue would be to sail one of the lifeboats to South Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles have a 43% {{chance of}} {{surviving}} their first year, and the annual survival rate of adults is about 80%. Choughs generally have a lifespan of about seven years, although an age of 17years has been recorded. The temperature and rainfall in the months preceding breeding correlates {{with the number of}} young fledging each year and <b>their</b> <b>survival</b> rate. Chicks fledging under good conditions are more likely to survive to breeding age, and have longer breeding lives than those fledging under poor conditions.|$|E
50|$|Survivin can be {{regarded}} as an oncogene as its aberrant overexpression in most cancer cells contributes to their resistance to apoptotic stimuli and chemotherapeutic therapies, thus contributing to <b>their</b> ongoing <b>survival.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The story {{describes}} how, {{after the}} captain of the Hettie Redd died, Timothy was asked to bring his body back for burial as temporary captain of the Hettie Redd. He did so reluctantly, suspecting that a violent storm, or [...] "tempis'", might strike. One did, sinking the Hettie Redd with all hands let alone him and drowning all its passengers in spite of all he did to ensure <b>their</b> <b>survivals.</b> Though he was absolved in the inquiry, Timothy carried the guilt {{for the rest of his}} days and often wished he too had drowned in the storm.|$|R
50|$|Withdrawal of {{the engines}} from service began in 1925, {{starting}} with unrebuilt engines, and continued until 1964. Despite {{the large number of}} locomotives of the class and <b>their</b> late <b>survival,</b> none were preserved.|$|R
5|$|Lloyd Irving and his friend, Genis Sage {{accompany}} the chosen, Colette Brunel and her guardians, Raine Sage and Kratos Aurion on her journey of world regeneration. The {{purpose of the}} journey is to replenish Sylvarant with mana, a necessary energy to <b>their</b> <b>survival.</b> The path of the journey consists of five temples which must be unsealed by Colette. On their journey, they meet Sheena Fujibayashi who comes from Tethe'alla, a world parallel to Sylvarant. She tells them about how the two worlds vie for each other's mana through the journey of regeneration.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar {{not only}} {{contains}} two radically different climatic zones, the rainforests {{of the east}} and the dry regions of the west, but also swings from extended drought to cyclone-generated floods. These climatic and geographical challenges, along with poor soils, low plant productivity, wide ranges of ecosystem complexity, and a lack of regularly fruiting trees (such as fig trees) have driven the evolution of lemurs' immense morphological and behavioral diversity. <b>Their</b> <b>survival</b> has required the ability to endure the persistent extremes, not yearly averages.|$|E
5|$|Quolls eat smaller mammals, small birds, lizards, and insects. Their natural {{lifespan}} {{is between}} two and five years. All species have drastically declined in numbers since Australasia was colonised by Europeans, with one species, the eastern quoll, becoming extinct on the Australian mainland, now being found only in Tasmania. Major threats to <b>their</b> <b>survival</b> include the cane toad, predators, urban development, and poison baiting. Conservation efforts include breeding programs in captivity, {{one of which is}} taking place in Tasmania with support from Rewilding Australia and Conjour.|$|E
30|$|In both of {{the cases}} {{reviewed}} above, unions’ objectives of keeping wages high and avoiding layoffs of union members run counter to <b>their</b> long-run <b>survival</b> in a context where population growth outpaces capital accumulation.|$|R
50|$|On October 1, 2007, both Spirit and Opportunity entered {{their fifth}} mission {{extension}} that extended operations into 2009, allowing the rovers {{to have spent}} five years exploring the Martian surface, pending <b>their</b> continued <b>survival.</b>|$|R
