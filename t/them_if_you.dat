500|$|In {{addition}} to the tired former prisoners and civilians, {{the majority of the}} Rangers had only slept for five to six hours over the past three days. The soldiers frequently had hallucinations or fell asleep as they marched. Benzedrine was distributed by the medics to keep the Rangers active during the long march. One Ranger commented on the effect of the drug: [...] "It felt like your eyes were popped open. You couldn't have closed <b>them</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> wanted to. One pill was all I ever took—it was all I ever needed." ...|$|E
500|$|Ryan Britt, {{while writing}} for Tor.com, thought more favourably of [...] "Home", {{including}} it in {{a list of}} six episodes from Enterprise which are comparable {{to the best of}} the other Star Trek series. It was described as [...] "the sort of episode that either rewards someone who liked the characters on this show, or could potentially get you to like <b>them</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> didn’t really know what was going on." [...] Britt's only complaint was that the romance between T'Pol and Tucker wasn't further developed as it brought out the best in Blalock and Trinneer.|$|E
5000|$|The phrase [...] "Smoke <b>'em</b> <b>if</b> <b>You</b> Got 'em" [...] or [...] "Smoke <b>if</b> <b>You</b> Got 'em" [...] predates {{this album}} and is slang for [...] "do what <b>you</b> want, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have the means." [...] The first phrase was popular during World War II meaning {{to take a}} break. Officers would say [...] "Smoke <b>'em</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> got 'em" [...] {{allowing}} the soldiers {{to take a break}} and smoke their cigarettes. Morrow - Combat! ...|$|R

One, there are four other teams in our division who are going to make sure that doesn't happen, and two, has anyone ever heard of plagiarism? [...] That was pretty good, especially coming from him. He's a quiet guy, so it was probably shocking when he said it. Not shocking in a bad way, like 'Wow, I can't believe he said that.' More like, 'Wow, he finally said something because he's a leader on that team and you definitely need to be a vocal leader." ...|$|E
500|$|Asked {{to assess}} his {{personal}} performance {{after the loss}} to Kansas State, Colt McCoy said, [...] "I think I've had some bad luck, I'm definitely a better quarterback, definitely more experienced—I've just had some bad luck. Things that can go the wrong way, have gone the wrong way — tipped balls and that stuff." [...] He also said there was room for improvement, [...] "Teams are blitzing us a lot more. We've handled it well for the most part, but there's so many {{things we can do}} better... If you ask every person on this offense, they'll tell you there's something individually they can do better." [...] After the loss to Oklahoma, Mack Brown said {{he did not want to}} hear about bad luck, [...] "By saying we're unlucky is just a cop-out, this game isn't about luck. [...] If you knock balls loose you should get on <b>them.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> tip balls in the air you should catch them. We're not going to have any excuses." [...] Brown cited the lack of big plays on defense, particularly the lack of forced turnovers, as a problem for Texas. [...] Both Brown and Greg Davis hinted that Jamaal Charles could face less playing time as a result of his problems hanging onto the ball.|$|E
500|$|O'Mahoney and Winter {{began working}} on the film in 2006. Winter had watched a film called The Women's Story, about two Iraqi women who had journeyed {{around the country and}} filmed what they saw. They wanted to make a {{documentary}} about [...] "the people never seen on the evening news, [...] presidents, prime ministers, generals and militants ... claiming to know something of Iraq's future". Winter explained that [...] "all these documentaries coming out of Iraq were done for or by adults. Iraqi children had not been more than a UN statistic about the dead, kidnapped or injured", so they decided to concentrate on what they viewed as the [...] "real source of Iraq's future" [...] – teenagers. [...] "I wanted {{to tell the story of}} Iraq in a different way. As journalists, we do stories about kids and teenagers, but we don't hear from <b>them.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> go to the UN reports, they are just a number and that's it." [...] O'Mahoney was a little more reticent; he had recently worked in Iraq but did not wish to return due to the civil war and the deteriorating condition of the country. When it was decided to use a school as a backdrop to the story, which could also be used to provide a chronological narrative, O'Mahoney and Winter realised it would be too dangerous for the students to be seen with either a Western or Iraqi camera crew because it would draw too much attention to them, and so they decided that the students would film the documentary themselves.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2006 {{interview}} with the Washington Post, Steel commented on gun control: [...] "Society should draw lines. What do you need an assault weapon for, if you're going hunting? That's overkill. But I don't think that means {{you go to a}} total ban {{for those who want to}} use gun for skeet shooting or hunting or things like that. But what's the point of passing gun laws if we're not going to enforce <b>them?</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> want to talk about gun control, that's where you need to start.

2500|$|Cline {{would become}} one of West's biggest career inspirations.

Then cast a spell over <b>them.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> can't do it with feeling, then don't." [...] In their early days in Nashville, West and her family would often not have enough to pay the rent or buy the week's groceries, so Cline would hire her to help with her wardrobe and West's husband Bill to play in her band. Cline even offered to help pay West's rent or buy groceries when she and Bill were struggling to stay in Nashville.|$|E

2500|$|The lyrics on {{the record}} were {{described}} by the band members as [...] "a collaborative psycho-therapy session wherein personal demons of various sizes and importance are exorcised, vilified, taken revenge upon and laid to rest." [...] Vig said they tried to deal with [...] "dark themes that I {{think a lot of}} people can relate to in some way or another", which included voyeurism, hedonism, perversion, obsession and [...] "the art of self-destruction." [...] Manson stated that even though she put together most of the songs, [...] "everybody has ideas that come to the table and I just use what I fancy. When we're working on something, the lyrics take a while to work on and [...] come to me and say 'I've had these ideas, use <b>them</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> want' and if there's something I like, I'll stick it in with my own, or vice-versa. Some people come in going 'I've got this great title for a song' and I might use that." [...] Manson remarked that while the content was [...] "a lot more poppy" [...] than most of her previous work, the songs invoked the dark side of her nature, as [...] "sometimes I'm a bit wee creepy, and that definitely comes out in the music." [...] She also declared that music [...] "unlocks sensations and feelings that you keep inside, that society doesn't allow you to show", saying that the gist of a mean-spirited song like [...] "Vow" [...] is very real despite [...] "none of us hav ever really acted on those feelings". Vig added that the band was eager to exploit the contrast between words and music: [...] "The initial idea was to make this a dark lyric with a shiny, happy, pop sensibility. You could be singing this really catchy line and realize the lyrics were totally wacked." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 16th {{season of}} The Simpsons has {{garnered}} generally positive reviews from critics, with many noting while the episodes are still good and funny {{they are of}} a lesser quality {{than those of the}} show's earlier seasons. CraveOnline gave the season a rating of 8.0 out of 10, and spoke highly of its [...] "little pieces of continuity", [...] "sharp parody", and [...] "non sequitur gags". Entertainment Focus gave it 4 out of 5 stars, concluding [...] "Some people have criticised The Simpsons claiming that the show is tired and has passed its prime. We don't agree with those people at all and think The Simpsons has been remarkably consistent in terms of its humour and stories. Sure it may have been eclipsed by the edgier Family Guy in more recent years but The Simpsons is, and always will be, one of the most original and talked-about shows. The Simpsons: Season 16 is another cracking instalment of the hit show and we still, after all these years, just can't get enough. High-Def Digest also gave a 4/5 star rating, saying [...] "As mentioned in the review, there are plenty of laughs to be had in this season, but very few of them come from a place that feels truly genuine and sincere. Sixteen seasons in, it seems that the show is a mixture of been-there-done-that sentiment and perfunctory punch lines. Aside from the so-so image, there's plenty here to keep the die-hard 'Simpsons' fan happy, so this one comes recommended for fans". Cinema Sentries said [...] "This is not something to pick up if you are a general TV fan, or a casual Simpsons fan. The overall quality of the season is not high enough, and you may not get satisfactory enjoyment from <b>them.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> sort of turned your back on the show, this probably isn't the season to check out. However, if you are a Simpsons devotee, then you will want to pick it up". DVDTalk wrote [...] "The Simpsons: Season Sixteen isn't the best of the series' run but it is a very strong collection of truly funny and frequently quite clever doses of animated comedic insanity." ...|$|E
