5|$|In string theory, the {{fundamental}} objects that give rise <b>to</b> <b>elementary</b> particles are the one-dimensional strings. Although the physical phenomena described by M-theory are still poorly understood, physicists {{know that the}} theory describes two- and five-dimensional branes. Much of the current research in M-theory attempts {{to better understand the}} properties of these branes.|$|E
5|$|Motley {{was born}} in Leesburg, Georgia and raised in Canton, Ohio, where his family moved when he was three years old. After going <b>to</b> <b>elementary</b> and junior high schools in Canton, Motley {{attended}} Canton McKinley High School, where he played on the football and basketball teams. He was especially good as a football fullback, and the McKinley Bulldogs posted a win-loss record of 25–3 during his tenure there. The team's three losses all came against Canton's chief rivals, a Massillon Washington High School team led by coach Paul Brown.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941 Smith {{formally}} {{enlisted in}} the Royal Air Force. He began his instruction with Initial Training Wing in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia's second city, and after six weeks there transferred <b>to</b> <b>Elementary</b> Flying Training School at Guinea Fowl, just outside Gwelo. The majority of the men he trained alongside were Australians, and many others were British. Smith was glad to find himself in a course that would ultimately lead to flying fighters as opposed to bombers—at Guinea Fowl, he learned to pilot Tiger Moths, then Harvards—and was also pleased to have been posted only a half-hour car journey from Selukwe. Late in the course he was picked out to undergo instruction as an officer cadet, which meant he was transferred to Thornhill, another Gwelo airbase. He passed out in September 1942 with the rank of pilot officer; his training in Southern Rhodesia had taken a year in all.|$|E

5|$|During {{most of the}} 19th century, {{schooling}} in England {{was provided}} either on a fee-paying basis or by the Church. To ensure that all children had access <b>to</b> <b>elementary</b> education, the Forster Act 1870 set up Local School Boards to provide elementary schools for all children aged 5 to 10. From 1880, schooling became compulsory for that age group. The Education Act 1902 consolidated these boards into local education authorities and allowed them to subsidise schools with money raised from local rate-payers. Alongside a grammar school for boys, a private school for girls and a mixed National School, Sleaford had four elementary schools in 1905: two Wesleyan (one was for infants), one Catholic and one other infants school. The construction of the Bass maltings (1901–06) and the Rauceby Asylum (1897–1902) led {{to an increase in}} the town's population and school inspectors found that the four schools could not accommodate every child in the town. The indebted Wesleyan schools could not afford any enlargements so the town's elementary school managers opted for Kesteven County Council to take responsibility under the 1902 Act. The Council built a schoolhouse on Church Lane at the cost of £11,500, which opened as Sleaford Council School on 4 May 1908. The staff and pupils at the Wesleyan schools were transferred there; its first headmaster was H. H. Godfrey, who had been master at the Wesleyan school. Built with a capacity of 600 pupils, 280 were on roll when teaching commenced.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} {{relativity}} usually encompasses two interrelated theories by Albert Einstein: special relativity and general relativity.

Obviously, however, the demands of living alone make it very unlikely that they will be able to obtain education through leaving.|$|E
