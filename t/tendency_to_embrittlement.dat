40|$|The {{photochemical}} reaction of poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) sheets under tensile loads has been investigated. Two types of UV irradiation tests {{were carried out}} in a vacuum environment: with and without a cooling apparatus. Chemical structures, thermal properties, and mechanical properties were measured to clarify photo-deterioration. Chemical analysis based on Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry (FT-IR) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) showed photochemical scission caused by UV exposure. Thermal properties, measured by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), indicated that a crosslinking reaction occurred during the radiation tests. Tensile properties of PEEK sheets after UV radiation clearly showed a <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> <b>embrittlement</b> affected not only by crosslinking {{but also by the}} orientation of molecular chains resulting from the temperature rise of the specimens. Furthermore, applied tensile stress during exposure accelerated molecular scission and disturbed the crosslinking effects of the tensile properties...|$|E

Two different fracture morphologies are observed on failed as-quenched samples: (i) near the maximum shear stress plane, shear ductile fracture with a typical vein pattern morphology is present, similar to the fracture surface morphology on monolayer amorphous metals, but with a different vein density typical for each layer; (ii) in some regions of the ribbon the upper NiP-based layer has failed by a shear ductile mechanism, while the lower, FeNiB-type layer shows ductile failure in the plane of maximum normal stress with typical chevron morphology. Relaxed samples show a <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> <b>embrittlement.</b> Chevron fracture morphology in the maximum normal stress plane, typical of the fracture of relaxed amorphous monolayers, is present in both layers.

40|$|It {{was long}} known that many strong metals can become {{weakened}} and brittle {{as the result of}} the accumulation of hydrogen within the metal. When the metal is stretched, it does not show normal ductile properties, but fractures prematurely. This problem can occur as the result of a hydrogen evolution reaction such as corrosion or electroplating, or due to hydrogen in the environment at the metal surface. High strength alloys such as steels are especially susceptible <b>to</b> hydrogen <b>embrittlement.</b> Nickel-hydrogen cells commonly use Inconel 718 alloy for the pressure container, and this also is susceptible <b>to</b> hydrogen <b>embrittlement.</b> Metals differ in their susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>embrittlement.</b> Hydrogen embrittlement in nickel-hydrogen cells is analyzed and the reasons why it may or may not occur are discussed.

However the delayed cracking due <b>to</b> hydrogen <b>embrittlement</b> remains <b>to</b> be a critical issue. Generally press hardening steel is susceptible <b>to</b> hydrogen <b>embrittlement</b> due <b>to</b> ultra-high strength and martensitic microstructure. The hydrogen charging tests clearly demonstrate {{that only a few}} ppm of diffusible hydrogen is sufficient <b>to</b> cause such <b>embrittlement.</b> Currently the hydrogen embrittlement cannot be detected inthe press hardened components and the embitteled components could collapse in the crash situation with fatal consequences arisen through dramatic loss in both strength and ductility. This paper introduces a new metallurgical solution to increase the resistance <b>to</b> hydrogen <b>embrittlement</b> of conventional press hardening steel based on 22 MnB 5 by Nb microalloying. In the hydrogen embrittlementand permeation tests the impact of Nb microalloying on the hydrogen embrittlement behavior was investigated under different hydrogen charging conditions and constant load. The test results revealed that Nb additionincreases the resistance <b>to</b> hydrogen <b>embrittlement</b> due <b>to</b> reduced hydrogen diffusivity.
