5|$|Again, {{this is a}} simplification, {{based on}} a {{hypothetical}} Earth that orbits at uniform speed around the Sun. The actual speed with which Earth orbits the Sun varies slightly during the year, so <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> the Sun seems to move along the ecliptic also varies. For example, the Sun is north of the celestial equator for about 185 days of each year, and south of it for about 180 days.

5|$|As {{the largest}} {{earthquake}} in California since the 1989 Loma Prieta event several years earlier, the mainshock caused a non-destructive tsunami that quickly reached the coast, and eventually Alaska and Hawaii several hours later. The tsunami was significant {{not because of}} its run-up, but because of <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> it reached the coast {{and for how long}} the waves persisted. Other strong earthquakes have affected the same area, with some that were clearly associated with the (interplate) Mendocino Fracture Zone, and others (like the two shocks on April 26) were intraplate earthquakes that ruptured within the Gorda Plate, but events that are unequivocally associated with the Cascadia subduction zone are very infrequent.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{commercial}} success of her early novels such as Adventures of the Wishing-Chair (1937) and The Enchanted Wood (1939), Blyton {{went on to}} build a literary empire, sometimes producing fifty books a year {{in addition to her}} prolific magazine and newspaper contributions. Her writing was unplanned and sprang largely from her unconscious mind; she typed her stories as events unfolded before her.

5|$|McCarthy's {{judicial}} career attracted {{some controversy}} because of <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> he dispatched {{many of his}} cases as he worked to clear the heavily backlogged docket he had inherited. Wisconsin had strict divorce laws, but when McCarthy heard divorce cases, he expedited them whenever possible, and he made {{the needs of children}} involved in contested divorces a priority. When it came to other cases argued before him, McCarthy compensated for his lack of experience as a jurist by demanding and relying heavily upon precise briefs from the contesting attorneys. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed a low percentage of the cases he heard, but he was also censured in 1941 for having lost evidence in a price fixing case.|$|E
5|$|The Sholes and Glidden was {{the first}} commercially {{successful}} typewriter. Industrialization and corporate growth in the late 19th century produced a business environment for which the device was well suited. New communications technologies, such as the telegraph and telephone, facilitated geographic expansion and increased <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> business was conducted. The resulting increase in the volume of correspondence required messages to be produced quickly and legibly. Before the typewriter, clerks and copyists could write relatively quickly in shorthand or longhand. The comprehension of these scripts, however, required either special training or close concentration. Typesetting was used when legibility was important, {{but it was a}} slow and expensive process. The typewriter succeeded because it simultaneously addressed both issues.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevailing}} {{thought in}} Victorian healthcare concerning {{the transmission of}} contagious diseases was the miasma theory, which held that most communicable diseases were caused by the inhalation of contaminated air.

Miasma was believed by most to be the vector of transmission of cholera, which was on the rise in 19th-century Europe. The disease was deeply feared by all, because of <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> it could spread, and its high fatality rates.|$|E

5|$|The {{specific}} epithet, tigris, {{as well as}} {{the common}} name, tiger, come from the Middle English tigre and the Old English tigras (a plural word), both used for the animal. These derive from the Old French tigre, itself a derivative of the Latin word tigris and the Greek word tigris. The original source may have been the Persian tigra meaning pointed or sharp and the Avestan tigrhi meaning an arrow, perhaps referring to <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> a tiger launches itself at its prey. It is worth mentioning that Mesopotamia, where the Caspian tiger had occurred, has a river called 'Tigris'.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the fire was under control, the house was almost totally destroyed, leaving behind only the garage and some front stonework. The fire had spread rapidly, and {{although}} high winds contributed to the intensity, authorities deemed <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> the house had become fully involved suspicious enough to bring in arson investigators. The bodies of Tim and Kelly were not recovered until the following morning, when the house had cooled enough to permit safe searching. Kelly had perished in her bed, most likely of smoke inhalation. Tim's body {{was found on the}} ground floor, near the kitchen. Investigators at first assumed he had died trying to escape, but later determined that he had perished in or near his bedroom, most likely of smoke inhalation and heat, and that his body had fallen through burned flooring to where it was discovered.|$|E
5|$|Fort Lahtzanit was {{the first}} {{defensive}} fortification of the Bar Lev Line to be captured, over one hour {{after the start of}} the assault. Israeli casualties were 60 killed and 26 captured; Egyptian losses were 23 killed, including one officer, and 7 wounded, including two officers. The most important factor leading to the capture of the fort was its isolation on all sides, and <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> the infantry reached and seized the firing ramp east of the fort before Israeli tanks occupied it. In contrast to the capture of Fort Lahtzanit, the attempt to capture Fort Orkal by the 135th Brigade went awry, and el-'Abassi was forced to commit a reserve infantry company on the west bank to help seize the fort. The company crossed at 4:00p.m. on October 6, and the following day Fort Orkal was captured.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{dynamics}} of market selection for an industry in which firms employ relatively simple pricing, production and investment routines and in which consumers switch between rival firms in response to price differentials but do not all do so instantaneously. The key issue is whether market processes result in the elimination of less efficient firms by their more efficient rivals. That is to say, do such processes unfailingly increase the efficiency <b>with</b> <b>which</b> available economic resources are used? In the context of duopoly, we show that {{the survival of the}} more efficient firm is not guaranteed and that, more generally, the outcome depends upon <b>the</b> <b>speeds</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> firms adjust prices and capacities and <b>with</b> <b>which</b> customers switch between rival firms.

5|$|Once the {{passages}} were cleared, engineers had to construct ten heavy bridges (using MTU bridgelayers, TMM bridgelayers and pontoon bridges), five light bridges, ten pontoon bridges and 35 ferries. The passages {{had to be}} opened in five to seven hours, immediately followed by the ferries, then the bridges two hours later, all the while under enemy fire. Of the heavy bridges, the Egyptians had only two Soviet-made PMP heavy folding bridges, which could be erected in a shorter time than most other bridges in their inventory, saving a few critical hours. These bridges were also much easier to repair. <b>The</b> <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> the engineers cleared {{the passages}} and laid the bridges and ferries would affect {{the course of the}} entire operation. Engineers also had to man the boats that would cross the assault infantry initially. Finally, they had to breach the minefields around Israeli defenses for the assault infantry.|$|E
5|$|Spurred by {{the success}} of the tall ships race and the International Garden Festival, Arrowcroft pushed on with the Albert Dock's renovation. With the Edward Pavilion {{refurbishment}} a success soon the company started on the Britannia and Atlantic pavilions (formerly the south and south east stacks), the latter of which required major structural repairs because of bomb damage it received during World War II. In 1986 the Merseyside Maritime Museum completed its move into the Albert Dock, having moved some exhibitions into the building in 1984. The museum, developed by Merseyside County Council had previously been located in the pilotage building and a salvage shed nearby. Also in 1986 work began on the largest of the dock warehouses, the Colonnades (formerly west stack). Ground floor shops were created with office space on the mezzanine level and apartments on the remaining floors. The first 37 of these apartments were completed by 1988 and <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> they sold was likened to 'sales day at Harrods'.|$|E
5|$|The size {{of these}} castles varied {{depending}} on the geography of the site, {{the decisions of the}} builder and the available resources. Analysis of the size of mottes has shown some distinctive regional variation; East Anglia, for example, saw much larger mottes being built than the Midlands or London. While motte-and-bailey and ringwork castles took great effort to build, they required relatively few skilled craftsmen allowing them to be raised using forced labour from the local estates; this, in addition to <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> they could be built – a single season, made them particularly attractive immediately after the conquest. The larger earthworks, particularly mottes, required an exponentially greater quantity of manpower than their smaller equivalents and consequently tended to be either royal, or belong to the most powerful barons who could muster the required construction effort. Despite motte-and-bailey and ringworks being common designs amongst Norman castles, each fortification was slightly different – some castles were designed with two baileys attached to a single motte, and some ringworks were built with additional towers added on; yet other castles were built as ringworks and later converted to motte-and-bailey structures.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> {{the club}} became {{established}} following its foundation {{is illustrated by}} the fact that it outgrew four successive grounds in its first seven years. The first was Cooper's Hill, where they played from 1878 to 1879. From 1879 to 1881, they appear to have alternated between Cooper's Hill and Dartmouth Park. During the 1881–82 season, they played at Bunn's Field, also known as the Birches. This had a capacity of between 1,500 and 2,000, and was Albion's first enclosed ground, allowing the club to charge an entrance fee for the first time. From 1882 to 1885, as the popularity of football increased, Albion rented the Four Acres ground from the well-established West Bromwich Dartmouth Cricket Club. But they quickly outgrew this new home and soon needed to move again. From 1885 to 1900, Albion played at Stoney Lane; their tenure of this ground was arguably the most successful period in the club's history, as they won the FA Cup twice and were runners-up three times.|$|E
