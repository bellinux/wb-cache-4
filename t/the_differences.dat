5|$|A 1989 {{document}} generally {{known as}} Aspects of Christian meditation set forth {{the position of}} the Holy See with respect to <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> between Christian and eastern styles of meditation. The document, issued as a letter to all Catholic bishops, stresses <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> between Christian and eastern meditative approaches. It warns of the dangers of attempting to mix Christian meditation with eastern approaches since that could be both confusing and misleading, and may result in the loss of the essential Christocentric nature of Christian meditation. The letter warned that euphoric states obtained through Eastern meditation {{should not be confused with}} prayer or assumed to be signs of the presence of God, a state that should always result in loving service to others. Without these truths, the letter said, meditation, which should be a flight from the self, can degenerate into a form of self-absorption.|$|E

5|$|In 1910, Eaton {{became the}} first {{scientist}} to publish a more {{detailed description of the}} entire Pteranodon skeleton, as it was known at the time. He used his findings to revise the classification of the genus once again based on a better understanding of <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> in pteranodont anatomy. Eaton conducted experiments using clay models of bones to help determine the effects of crushing and flattening on the shapes of the arm bones Williston had used in his own classification. Eaton found that most of <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> in bone shapes could be easily explained by the pressures of fossilization, and concluded that no Pteranodon skeletons had any significant differences from each other besides their size. Therefore, Eaton was left to decide his classification scheme based on differences in the skulls alone, which he assigned to species just as Marsh did, by their size. In the end, Eaton recognized only three valid species: P. occidentalis, P. ingens, and P. longiceps.|$|E
