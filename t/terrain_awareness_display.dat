The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) defines GPWS {{as a type of}} <b>terrain</b> <b>awareness</b> warning system (TAWS).

40|$|Geographically {{distributed}} workgroups {{have potential}} for improving collaborative work, {{but can be}} challenging. One challenge is identifying which group members are responsible for specific elements of a task when group members' actions are not easily observable. As such, individuals participating in geographically distributed work may be more susceptible to role ambiguity, which is an unclear understanding of one's own or others' roles within the group. Visual <b>awareness</b> <b>displays</b> may help mitigate role ambiguity by making otherwise unclear information more apparent, but {{the design of the}} <b>awareness</b> <b>display</b> may also impact how role ambiguity is experienced. Specifically, tailoring displays to highlight only role-relevant information and other information may be more beneficial than displays that either highlight or abstract all information. This study explores the effect of <b>awareness</b> <b>display</b> type on role ambiguity and communication about role information on geographically distributed individuals collaborating on a video game task using an experimental design. One hundred eighty six participants were assigned to groups of three individuals and completed a fifteen-minute task in the online multiplayer game Neverwinter Nights, in which they had access to either a tailored, abstract, or detailed visual <b>awareness</b> <b>display.</b> Their performance and communication were recorded and analyzed along with surveys measuring role ambiguity and objective role understanding. The results indicated that individuals most accurately identified group members' roles when they had access to the detailed <b>display,</b> but that <b>awareness</b> <b>display</b> type did not have an effect on feelings of role ambiguity. In terms of performance, there was an overall trend toward the detailed display being best for facilitating performance in on the less collaborative aspect of the task, although there was an interaction such that more frequent video game players performed better than less frequent players, but only when they had access to the tailored display. For the more collaborative aspect of the task, however, the abstract display best facilitated performance. <b>Awareness</b> <b>display</b> type did not impact any type of communication between group members. Future work in this area can explore different <b>awareness</b> <b>display</b> configuration types on role ambiguity, or the impact of prior experience on interpreting these displays. ! ! ! ! ! 2018 - 08 - 2...|$|R
40|$|Personal, mobile displays, such {{as those}} on mobile phones, are ubiquitous, yet for the most part, underutilized. We present results from a field {{experiment}} that investigated {{the effectiveness of these}} displays as a means for improving awareness of daily life (in our case, self-monitoring of physical activity). Twenty-eight participants in three experimental conditions used our UbiFit system for a period of three months in their day-to-day lives over the winter holiday season. Our results show, for example, that participants who had an <b>awareness</b> <b>display</b> were able to maintain their physical activity level (even during the holidays), while the level of physical activity for participants who did not have an <b>awareness</b> <b>display</b> dropped significantly.

5000|$|To help avoid {{controlled}} flight into terrain (CFIT), aircraft use {{systems such as}} ground-proximity warning systems (GPWS), which use radar altimeters as a key element. One of the major weaknesses of GPWS {{is the lack of}} [...] "look-ahead" [...] information, because it only provides altitude above terrain [...] "look-down". In order to overcome this weakness, modern aircraft use a <b>terrain</b> <b>awareness</b> warning system (TAWS).|$|R
40|$|Motivation - Both multi-team {{systems and}} <b>awareness</b> <b>displays</b> {{have been studied}} more often in the past years, but there hasn't been much focus on the {{combination}} of these two subjects. Apart from doing so, we are particularly interested in the difficulties encountered when multi-team systems are distributed among different locations and how interface technology plays a role in overcoming these. We hypothesise that an activity <b>awareness</b> <b>display</b> will positively effect the performance of teams that are collaborating at a distance. Research approach - During an experiment we look at two teams of two persons each working together on a complex task. In total 20 multi-teams are tested. Half of them is provided with a display containing information about the other team in order to raise their activity awareness. Performance, time, communication and back-up behaviour are measured. After the task participants are questioned about their perceived performance, workload and inter-team coordination. Design - An activity <b>awareness</b> <b>display</b> should communicate the current activity being executed, the status of that activity, and the workload of the remote team. Originality/Value - The goal of this project is to lay out a theoretical base for designing tools to improve the performance of remotely collaborating teams such as Urban Search And Rescue teams missions. Take away message - An <b>awareness</b> <b>display</b> hypothetically improves multi-team performance through more back-up behaviour and less communication...|$|R
25|$|The {{final report}} {{stated that the}} {{accident}} resulted from the pilots’ lack of a common action plan during the approach, the final approach being continued below the Minimum Decision Altitude without ground visual reference being acquired, the inappropriate application of flight control inputs during the go-around and after the activation of the <b>Terrain</b> <b>Awareness</b> and Warning System, and the flight crew’s lack of monitoring and controlling of the flight path.|$|R

40|$|Requests for {{communication}} via mobile devices can be disruptive {{to the current}} task or social situation. To reduce the frequency of disruptive requests, one promising approach is to provide callers with cues of a receiver’s context through an <b>awareness</b> <b>display,</b> allowing informed decisions of when to call. Existing displays typically provide cues based on what can be readily sensed, which may not match what is needed during the call decision process. In this paper, we report results of a four week diary study of mobile phone usage, where users recorded what context information they considered when making a call, and what information they wished others had considered when receiving a call. Our results were distilled into lessons {{that can be used}} to improve the design of <b>awareness</b> <b>displays</b> for mobile devices, e. g., show frequency of a receiver’s recent communication and distance from a receiver to her phone. We discuss technologies that can enable cues indicated in these lessons to be realized within <b>awareness</b> <b>displays,</b> as well as discuss limitations of such displays and issues of privacy...|$|R

50|$|Immediately {{after this}} communication, {{confusion}} occurred inside the cockpit.

5000|$|... a <b>Terrain</b> <b>awareness</b> {{and warning}} system (TAWS) uses a digital terrain map, {{together}} with position {{information from a}} navigation system such as GPS, to predict whether the aircraft's current flight path could put it in conflict with obstacles such as mountains or high towers, {{that would not be}} detected by GPWS (which uses the ground elevation directly beneath the aircraft). One of the best examples of this type of technology is the Auto-GCAS (Ground Collision Avoidance System) and PARS (Pilot Activated Recovery System) that was installed on the entire USAF fleet of F-16's in 2014.|$|R
50|$|The {{occurrence}} of a GPWS alert typically happens {{at a time}} of high workload and nearly always surprises the flight crew. Almost certainly, the aircraft is not where the pilot thinks it should be, and the response to a GPWS warning can be late in these circumstances. Warning time can also be short if the aircraft is flying into steep terrain since the downward looking radio altimeter is the primary sensor used for the warning calculation. The EGPWS improves <b>terrain</b> <b>awareness</b> and warning times by introducing the Terrain Display and the Terrain Data Base Look Ahead protection.|$|R
