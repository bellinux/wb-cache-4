25|$|Besides {{top rated}} {{universities}} which provide highly competitive world class education to their pupils, India {{is also home}} to many universities which have been founded with the sole objective of making easy money. Regulatory authorities like UGC and AICTE have been <b>trying</b> <b>very</b> hard to extirpate the menace of private universities which are running courses without any affiliation or recognition. Indian Government has failed to check on these education shops, which are run by big businessmen & politicians. Many private colleges and universities do not fulfil the required criterion by the Government and central bodies (UGC, AICTE, MCI, BCI etc.) and take students for a ride. For example, many institutions in India continue to run unaccredited courses as there is no legislation strong enough to ensure legal action against them. Quality assurance mechanisms have failed to stop misrepresentations and malpractices in higher education. At the same time regulatory bodies have been accused of corruption, specifically in the case of deemed-universities. In this context of lack of solid quality assurance mechanism, institutions need to step-up and set higher standards of self-regulation.|$|E
500|$|This is my problem. I've had {{signs of}} it {{for a very long}} time. It's caused {{problems}} within my family. I thought a career in the military would get rid of it. It's not something I seek out for attention, and I've been <b>trying</b> <b>very,</b> very hard {{to get rid of it}} by placing myself in situations where it would be impossible. But, it's not going away; it's haunting me more and more as I get older. Now, the consequences of it are dire, at a time when it's causing me great pain in itself ...|$|E

500|$|Two decades later, {{the song}} {{received}} positive reviews from critics. [...] Jose F. Promis from Allmusic commented that [...] "years later [...] still sounded as fresh and innocent as {{when it was}} first released". [...] Stewart Mason, also from Allmusic, commented that the song is an unexpected departure from the group's previous dance-oriented sound, comparing it with Spandau Ballet's [...] "True", adding that [...] "Bailey is not actually technically very good, but he's clearly <b>trying</b> <b>very</b> hard", and felt that the song [...] "is a bit labored [...] but overall, 'Hold Me Now' [...] deserved its huge hit status". [...] Raymond Fiore from Entertainment Weekly said that the song [...] "still sounds good today" [...] and called it [...] "the sound of new wave-pop brilliance". [...] In 2005 the song ranked #308 in Blenders list of the 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born, describing it as [...] "a new wave let's-stay-together plea" [...] that is [...] "so cornball it works".|$|E
500|$|Three years later, in the {{build-up}} to {{the release}} of Manhunt 2, the controversy re-ignited. Two days after announcing the game, which was set for release in July, Take-Two Interactive (Rockstar's parent company) issued a statement which read, in part: [...] "We are aware that in direct contradiction to all available evidence, certain individuals continue to link the original Manhunt title to the Warren Leblanc case in 2004. The transcript of the court case makes it quite clear what really happened. At sentencing the Judge, defense, prosecution and Leicester police all emphasized that Manhunt played no part in the case." [...] Later that day, however, Patrick and Giselle Pakeerah condemned the decision to release a sequel, and insisted that Manhunt was a factor in their son's murder. Upon the announcement of the sequel, Patrick stated [...] "I'm very disappointed. This is rubbing salt into the wounds in the month we will be marking the anniversary of Stefan's death. I'm very surprised they are doing this after all that has happened and all the publicity." [...] Giselle added [...] "It is an insult to my son's memory that they have announced this game in the month we will be marking this anniversary. These game moguls are {{making a lot of money}} out of games which are morally indecent. Why do they have to pump more violence into society?" [...] Leicester East MP Keith Vaz supported the Pakeerahs, claiming he was [...] "astonished" [...] that Rockstar were making a sequel; [...] "It is contempt for those who are <b>trying</b> <b>very</b> hard to ensure something is done to control the violent nature of these games." ...|$|E

SpaceX COO Gwynne Shotwell said at the Singapore Satellite Industry Forum in summer 2013 [...] "If we get this [...] right, and we’re <b>trying</b> <b>very</b> hard to get this right, we’re looking at launches {{to be in the}} [...] range, which would really change things dramatically." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{influence}} on bicycle culture from Copenhagen is the [...] Cycle chic movement. It grew from reactions to {{a photo of}} a girl wearing her regular clothes on a bike, which inspired the photographer, Michael Colville-Andersen, to start the blog Copenhagen Cycle Chic featuring mainly female subjects riding their bikes in fashionable everyday clothes. Its popularity have spawned a global movement with over 100 Cycle Chic blogs featuring similarly themed photography from other cities and areas around the world. Bloggers around the world are <b>trying</b> <b>very</b> hard to get featured on the Cycle Chic blog because they think it's cool. So now many people are making their own blogs that feature cyclists around the world. Most of them are associated with the original blog, the Copenhagen Cycle Chic.|$|E
2500|$|Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum {{were the}} only {{candidates}} to accept the invitation to participate. The campaigns of Jon Huntsman and Ron Paul both released statements declining the invitation. Ron Paul's campaign wrote, [...] "Mr. Trump's participation will contribute to an unwanted circus-like atmosphere," [...] while Jon Huntsman's campaign said in a statement, [...] "We have declined {{to participate in the}} 'Presidential Apprentice' Debate with The Donald," [...] alluding to the Celebrity Apprentice reality show for which Trump is host. Trump responded, [...] "Few people take Ron Paul seriously and many of his views and presentation make him a clown-like candidate. I am glad he and Jon Huntsman, who has inconsequential poll numbers or a chance of winning, will not be attending the debate and wasting the time of the viewers who are <b>trying</b> <b>very</b> hard to make a very important decision." ...|$|E

[...] However, {{the moment}} that [...] "represented {{the point of no}} return" [...] came that Wednesday night, as a [...] "clearly liberated" [...] O'Brien made this joke in his monologue: [...] "I'm <b>trying</b> <b>very</b> hard to stay {{positive}} here, and I want to tell you something.

2500|$|Denver Post {{contributor}} Joanne Ostrow {{declared the}} protagonist of the series a [...] "female answer to SpongeBob SquarePants". Among the favorable reception was a mixed review from Common Sense Medias Emily Ashby. She said while it [...] "maintains a chaotic pace, {{and there are no}} real attempts to teach strong positive lessons [...] Young tweens will likely enjoy Bessie's outlandish, fantasy-fueled adventures– which are fast-paced and, on the surface, entertaining." [...] Ed Liu of Toon Zone called The Mighty B! a show that he admires more than what he [...] "truly love", stating: [...] "There is prodigious talent behind it and its wonderfully energetic, boisterous comedy. It's clearly <b>trying</b> <b>very,</b> very hard to be entertaining and largely succeeds [...] I almost feel bad for not liking The Mighty B! more than I do, and I'm still not sure why I don't enjoy it more". He noted it was worth pointing out that more recent episodes of the show seem [...] "more assured and funnier" [...] than the eight episodes on the We Got the Bee DVD.|$|E
2500|$|Some photographers {{have found}} {{creative}} ways around these limitations. Louie Liotta of The New York Post told John Tierney {{he holds his}} camera near the ground, pointing upward, and walks with it for a short distance, {{in order to get}} a shot of the defendant's face as he or she is ducking downwards to avoid the cameras. Andrew Savulich of the Daily News looks for unusual angles and juxtapositions, once putting the station house's sleeping cat in the foreground. To catch the defendant's face, he stands near the front door at the top of the steps. [...] "For some reason, even when a guy has decided to duck his head, he usually lifts it for a second when he starts to go down steps", he explains. [...] "You sometimes catch this lost-in-space look, the eyes fixed at a distance, as if he's <b>trying</b> <b>very</b> hard to be somewhere else." [...] Jim Estrin of the Times says the police officers at the door sometimes block that shot for him, so he starts in the middle, shooting as he runs, and then gets on the other side of the police car for a shot as the defendant enters.|$|E
