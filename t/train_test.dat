50|$|The X-26A {{was used}} by the United States Navy (USN) to <b>train</b> <b>test</b> pilots in the {{condition}} of yaw/roll coupling. Since jet trainers were known to be dangerous in this condition, the X-26 was based on the Schweizer SGS 2-32 sailplane. Sailplanes react much slower and are easier to control than jet aircraft, making the X-26 a much safer training platform. Four aircraft were originally ordered. Three of the original planes crashed. The USN purchased a replacement for each of the crashed units.|$|E
50|$|There {{is also a}} small, two room museum with a {{collection}} of Edison memorabilia such as historic light bulbs, phonographs, dynamos and portions of Edison's electric <b>train</b> <b>test</b> track. Tours are available for free but the Edison Tower Memorial Corporation recommends you donate at least $5.00 per person. Souvenirs are also available at the museum. After it was put on the list of New Jersey's most endangered historic sites in 1997 (the tower was closed in 1992 after slabs or concrete started falling from the 54-year-old freestanding structure), the Edison Township Memorial Corporation started a $3.875 million renovation. On October 24th, 2015, the end of the restoration was marked by a rededication ceremony which included the relighting of the tower. In the future, there are plans to build a new, larger museum featuring many hands-on activities, and exhibits with artifacts. Surrounding the two historic acres is a small forest with a couple of trails. In the forest are a small pond, a meadow and several ravines that are visible from the trail. On Christie Street, the world's first street lit by electric lights, there are several informative boards describing Menlo Park in the Edison Era.|$|E
5000|$|The {{basis for}} the {{construction}} of the line was a treaty between the Grand Duchy of Hesse and the Kingdom of Bavaria on 28 March 1852. The concession to build the line in Hesse-Darmstadt was granted on 3 March 1856 and construction began after the harvest of 1856. In February 1856, the section between Mainspitze ("Main spit" [...] on the Rhine opposite Mainz) and Darmstadt was completed. On 19 April 1858 the Grand Duke Louis III visited the construction site at Mainspitze and used a <b>train.</b> <b>Test</b> runs were operated on the line from 18 July. The Rhine-Main line finally opened on 1 August 1858 between Mainspitze and Darmstadt. It was first released for freight trains and a little later for the first passenger trains. The eastern section to Aschaffenburg was opened on 15 November 1858, with scheduled passenger trains operating on 27 December 1858. At the beginning there were three trains each way, each day; a few years later there were eight. The construction of the railway infrastructure cost 3.9 million guilders. The duplication of the line began in 1871. It was praised by passengers for having glass windows in its third class carriages—in contrast to the adjacent Main-Neckar Railway.|$|E

In order to solve this problem, in this paper, it proposes a radar signal recognition method based on fractal box dimension and neural network under the condition of unstable SNR. Firstly, it extracts box counting dimension features of four different radiation source signals, and then uses the characteristic values of stable box counting dimension as the inputs of the neural network. Finally, it can recognize the four different kinds of radiation source signals. Simulation results show that, taking the box counting dimension characteristics as the input of the neural network to <b>train,</b> <b>test</b> and classify, it has good recognition rate in a certain changed range of SNR, and it has more widely application in the application environment...|$|E
40|$|Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) {{have been}} found efficient, {{particularly}} in problems where characteristics of the processes are stochastic and difficult to describe using explicit mathematical models. However, time series prediction based on ANN algorithms is fundamentally difficult and faces problems. One of the major shortcomings is the over-fitting while training session and occurs when a ANN loses its generalization. In this research, Generalized Neural Network (GNN) model is developed to overcome the drawbacks of conventional forecasting techniques. Using GNN helped avoid over-fitting of training data which was observed as a limitation of classical ANN models. Real inflow data collected over the last 130 years at Lake Nasser was used to <b>train,</b> <b>test</b> and validate the proposed model. Results show that the proposed GNN model outperforms Non-Generalized Neural Network and conventional auto-regressive models and it could provide accurate inflow forecasting...|$|E

In this report, the relationship between the statistical properties of <b>training,</b> <b>testing</b> and validation sets and model performance and the effect of the proportion of data used for <b>training,</b> <b>testing</b> and validation on model performance are investigated for the case study of predicting the settlement of shallow foundations on cohesionless soils.
