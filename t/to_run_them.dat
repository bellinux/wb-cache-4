5|$|Founded in 1891, the Society for the {{improvement}} of New Forest Ponies organised a stallion show and offered financial incentives to encourage owners of good stallions <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>them</b> on the Forest. In 1905 the Burley and District NF Pony Breeding and Cattle Society was set up to start the stud book and organise the Breed Show; the two societies merged in 1937 to form the New Forest Pony Breeding and Cattle Society. Overall numbers of livestock grazing the Forest, including ponies, tended to decline in the early twentieth century; in 1945 there were just 571 ponies depastured. By 1956 the number of ponies of all breeds on the Forest had more than doubled to 1,341. Twenty years later pony numbers were up to 3,589, rising to 4,112 in 1994, before dipping back below four thousand until 2005. As of 2011, there were 4,604 ponies grazing on the New Forest.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech {{football}} was Atlanta's one major sports franchise {{during this time}} frame. To hold a ticket to watch the Yellow Jackets play was highly valued and was difficult to obtain. During the games, Bobby Dodd sat in a folding chair at a card table on the side line, rarely standing or showing interest in the game. Dodd took his seat and left the pacing to his assistants. When a crisis arose, Dodd would decide which plays to be run and the designated players <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>them.</b> Dodd sometimes made unusual substitutions, as on a Saturday in Athens when Georgia Tech {{was about to be}} upset. Dodd sent in a small halfback who had been frequently injured during his career, who then broke to the right faking a run, stopped, threw a pass for a touchdown and returned to the bench. What Dodd brought to Grant Field was a kind of unbruising football other coaches couldn't understand: runty halfbacks; lightweight linemen; rarely a classic quarterback. Once free substitution became possible, no one made more use of it than Dodd.|$|E
5|$|The Lucera, {{trying the}} same evasive tactic, {{was the next}} galley attacked; a Dutch galleot, which drove under full sail managed to ram her. The galley was struck between the {{mainmast}} and stern, with a blow which carried away the assailant's own bowsprit, but in return completely demolished {{the stern of the}} galley. Vice-Admiral Cant came up once more in the Half-moon, and finished Lucera (Morning Star) off by ramming, tearing the galley apart. Meanwhile, Victory and two States' galleots were chasing two galleys; San Juan and Jacinto who were already in a sinking state. With nowhere to escape and the gale blowing against them, the only option was for the respective commanders <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>them</b> aground near Nieuwpoort. In the end, both galleys succeeded in reaching the safety of Niewpoort. Another galley managed to evade the Dutch and English long enough but it too ended up being wrecked on the French coast near Calais. The galley San Luis, which bore Spinola himself and his thirty-six pay chests, attempted to reach Dunkirk, but as the tide was low, she was forced to wait beyond a sandbank. Ten Dutch ships fell upon San Luis, but Spinola succeeded in sailing between the Dutch vessels and reached Dunkirk. With this the battle had ended and a Dutch blockade formed to prevent Spinola's escape.|$|E

5|$|The first {{generation}} of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU1) was {{released to the public}} on October2, 2006, delivering a 20-30X speedup for some calculations over its CPU-based GROMACS counterparts. It was the first time GPUs had been used for either distributed computing or major molecular dynamics calculations. GPU1 gave researchers significant knowledge and experience with the development of GPGPU software, but in response to scientific inaccuracies with DirectX, on April10, 2008 it was succeeded by GPU2, the second generation of the client. Following the introduction of GPU2, GPU1 was officially retired on June6. Compared to GPU1, GPU2 was more scientifically reliable and productive, ran on ATI and CUDA-enabled Nvidia GPUs, and supported more advanced algorithms, larger proteins, and real-time visualization of the protein simulation. Following this, the third generation of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU3) was released on May25, 2010. While backward compatible with GPU2, GPU3 was more stable, efficient, and flexibile in its scientific abilities, and used OpenMM on top of an OpenCL framework. Although these GPU3 clients did not natively support the operating systems Linux and macOS, Linux users with Nvidia graphics cards were able <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>them</b> through the Wine software application. GPUs remain Folding@home's most powerful platform in FLOPS. As of November 2012, GPU clients account for 87% of the entire project's x86 FLOPS throughput.|$|E

25|$|Auckland's network {{consists}} of four lines: Southern, Eastern, Western and Onehunga. All services on these lines are provided by electric trains, the conversion from diesel being completed {{by the end of}} 2015 {{with the exception of the}} non-electrified section of track between Papakura and Pukekohe, where a diesel train shuttle service operates. For nine years Tranz Metro also operated the suburban passenger services in Auckland, however in mid-2004 Connex (later Veolia, now Transdev) won the contract <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>them.</b> In recent years the mothballed Onehunga Branch was reopened (2010) and a new line was built (Manukau Branch, opened April 2012). Recent major projects include electrification of the Auckland suburban network and the building of the City Rail Link. Most Auckland rolling stock is owned by Auckland Transport (AT) who fund all services.|$|E

Summing up, he said [...] "No DM should be without them, for even if he never gets a chance <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>them,</b> they are a source of much excellent design quality." ...|$|E
500|$|Averaging {{a murder}} every ten minutes, Tenebrae ranks {{as one of}} Argento's bloodiest films. In the United Kingdom, the film was shorn of five seconds of [...] "sexualized violence" [...] by the British Board of Film Classification prior to its {{theatrical}} release, on 19 May 1983. The advertising campaign for Tenebrae featured posters and a soundtrack sleeve depicting a woman with her throat cut, blood dripping from the wound. According to Jones, who worked for Tenebraes distributor at the time, in the UK the posters had to be recalled after the London Underground refused <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>them.</b> New posters were issued that replaced the image of the wound and blood with a red ribbon.

500|$|The board's efforts {{failed to}} meet the {{government}}'s expectations; in December 1917, Woodrow Wilson, the President of the United States, ordered the federal government {{to take control of the}} railroads, setting up a United States Railroad Administration (USRA) <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>them.</b> Harrison worked for the USRA during the war and, under its regulations, was required to step down as chairman of the Southern Railway. By the time the USRA returned control of Southern in March 1920 its treasury was bare. A few years of operation returned a surplus to the company, which led to the stockholders requesting in 1923 that the railroad pay a dividend to the holders of the common stock, something Southern had never done. Harrison managed to block the request, but in March 1924 a subsequent demand was successful, and a dividend of $5 (approximately $ as of [...] ) per share was declared. That was increased to $7 (approximately $ as of [...] ) per share in 1926 and $8 (approximately $ as of [...] ) in 1928.|$|E
500|$|At {{the outset}} of his premiership, Greenfield served as Provincial Treasurer as well as Premier. [...] In both of these capacities, he {{was faced with a}} provincial deficit, which reached an {{accumulated}} total of $4 million between his taking office {{and the end of the}} 1922 fiscal year. [...] One reason for this was the government's involvement in railways: it had found itself the owner of four uncompleted money-losing railway lines after the private syndicates set up <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>them</b> collapsed due to construction cost overruns. [...] By 1922, the government had lost a total of $6.7 million on the endeavor, with an additional $5 million expected to follow that year—37% of the estimated 1922 provincial budget. [...] Greenfield wanted to sell the lines to the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), a course of action that was endorsed by Brownlee, but many farmers despised the CPR and most UFA MLAs preferred to keep the lines government-operated. [...] Moreover, Greenfield's own Minister of Railways, Vernor Smith, was among this faction. [...] This problem plagued Greenfield for his entire term as Premier, and it was not until Brownlee succeeded him that a resolution came in the form of a $25 million sale to the major lines.|$|E
500|$|The {{surroundings}} of Cortina {{have been}} the location {{for a number of}} movies, including mountain climbing scenes for Cliffhanger, Krull and [...] The Pink Panther. The resort was the primary area for location shooting in Sergio Corbucci's Revisionist Spaghetti Western The Great Silence; the resort was used to represent Utah in the winter of 1898. It was a glamorous location for Elizabeth Taylor in Ash Wednesday (1973), and was also a major location for the 1981 James Bond film For Your Eyes Only. [...] Roger Moore's James Bond meets the character Luigi Ferrara (John Moreno) at the peak of Tofana and stays at the Hotel Miramonti. A number of action sequences were shot in the town involving Bond and Erich Kriegler (John Wyman), as Kriegler competes in the biathlon. The battle culminates in one of the famous ski chase sequences in film, where Bond has to escape Kriegler and a crew of assassins on a spike-wheeled motorcycles, his route taking them all onto the bobsleigh run. The actual town centre was also the scene of the first attack on Bond and his partner Melina Havelock (Carole Bouquet) by two motorcyclists who attempted <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>them</b> over, only for Bond to eliminate them both, putting one of them through the window of a local florist.|$|E

2500|$|Although its Innovia ART 100 {{trains are}} capable of driving themselves, the TTC chose <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>them</b> semi-automatically with {{operators}} on board {{in order to keep}} peace with their main union. This conversion proved much more difficult than imagined; the small confines of the Innovia ART 100 car meant that the traditional Toronto solution of taking up the front-right corner of the cab left too little room for the operator to work in, and the entire front of the car had to be used up, reducing seating. Additionally, the Innovia ART 100 control system was based on [...] "dumb" [...] cars and [...] "smart" [...] control centres, so there was no system on the train itself for control or presenting information. These systems had to be retrofitted and were the cause of considerable expense and confusion.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the most}} {{distinctive}} feature of MACs is their aircraft carrier function, they were conceived {{at a time}} when a shortage of shipping capacity threatened to undermine the Allied invasion of North Africa and beyond, and careful planning was needed to maximise their military effectiveness with as little detriment as possible to the carriage of cargo. [...] In their trading role, MACs operated {{under the aegis of the}} Ministry of War Transport, with day-to-day management falling to their owners or allotted shipping companies, while control of military aspects fell to the Admiralty, with a new section (the Trade Division DEMS Air Section) specially set up to act as coordinating authority. [...] The MACs operated on the North Atlantic route primarily in support of the 'ON' and 'HX' series of convoys. [...] An alternative plan to operate tanker MACs with CU convoys between the United Kingdom and Curaçao was rejected because convoys on that route were too fast. [...] Tankers on the North Atlantic route ordinarily loaded at New York City, but this was undesirable for the MACs because it would have been military wasteful <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>them</b> between the ON/HX landfall port of Halifax, Nova Scotia and New York, where convoys were already under the umbrella of land-based aircraft. [...] An 'oil pool' was therefore established at Halifax specifically to enable the tanker MACs to load there, while grain MACs were already able to use the port's pre-existing bulk loading facility. [...] The Firth of Clyde was initially designated as the UK terminus for all MAC cargoes because of its superior aviation training facilities. [...] On discovering that it would take more than a week to unload a single ship at the un-modernised facility in Glasgow, it was decided that grain MACs would discharge at Alexandra Dock, Liverpool, where two grain ships could be unloaded simultaneously in thirty-six hours. [...] Tanker MACs normally discharged on the Clyde, with the Mersey as an alternative.|$|E
