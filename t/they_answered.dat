5|$|In a {{range of}} studies, {{participants}} have been requested to answer general knowledge questions, each of which had two possible answers, and also to estimate their chances of answering each question correctly. If the participants had a sufficient degree of self-knowledge, their level of confidence in regard to each answer they gave would be high for the questions <b>they</b> <b>answered</b> correctly and lower for the ones <b>they</b> <b>answered</b> wrong. However, this generally is not the case. Many people are overconfident; indeed, studies show that most people systematically overestimate their own abilities. Moreover, people are overconfident {{about their ability to}} answer questions that are deemed to be hard but underconfident on questions that are considered easy.|$|E
5|$|The episodes {{featured}} {{game play}} {{based on the}} previous rule set of the syndicated version (including the rule changes implemented in season seven) but used the Fastest Finger round to select contestants. Various celebrities also made special guest appearances {{at the end of}} every episode; each guest played one question for a chance at $50,000 for a charity of their choice, being allowed to use any one of the four lifelines in place at the time (Phone-a-Friend, Ask the Audience, Double Dip, and Ask the Expert), but still earned a minimum of $25,000 for the charity if <b>they</b> <b>answered</b> the question incorrectly.|$|E
5|$|You Don't Know Jack {{is played}} {{out as a}} fictional trivia game show for one to four players, with the goal to win the most virtual money {{at the end of}} the game. Each game uses a pre-defined set of ten {{questions}} from over seventy episodes, titled by the name of the show's fictional sponsor. Most questions are multiple choice, providing one correct and three incorrect answers, along with a short timer that starts once the question has been completely presented. All players play at the same time, entering their choice of answer before the 20 second timer runs out. If a player is correct, they get a base dollar amount plus a bonus defined by how quickly <b>they</b> <b>answered,</b> while if they miss the question, they lose a similar amount of money. Failing to answer does not cost the player any money.|$|E
50|$|High Stakes - The {{players are}} shown the vague subject for each question. Each player then bets {{an amount of}} points on the question. If <b>they</b> <b>answer</b> {{correctly}} <b>they</b> win the gambled amount of points and lose that amount if <b>they</b> <b>answer</b> incorrectly.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the second}} series the {{remaining}} 3 players are each given 60 seconds to answer as many questions as possible. They {{are given the}} category and have to choose which level <b>they</b> want <b>answer.</b> If <b>they</b> <b>answer</b> correctly, <b>they</b> get the points, but if <b>they</b> <b>answer</b> wrongly, {{the first of the}} other 3 players to buzz in can steal the points. The person that gets the highest score goes through to answer their [...] "Question of Genius".|$|R
50|$|The contestants' run ends when <b>they</b> either <b>answer</b> a {{question}} incorrectly, decide to not answer {{a question}} and walk away with their prize money, or if <b>they</b> <b>answer</b> all 15 questions correctly (winning $1 million).|$|R
25|$|In 1967, Barker {{hosted the}} {{short-lived}} game show The Family Game for Chuck Barris, where he asked children contestants {{questions about their}} families' lives, and the parents had to guess how <b>they</b> <b>answered,</b> similar to The Newlywed Game.|$|E
25|$|In early 1919, Tsyganko {{emigrated from}} what was then being {{recognized}} as Romanian territory. He settled in Odessa, a Ukrainian port city, where he established the Peasants' Faction in exile, alongside a dozen other former Sfatul deputies. He joined efforts with Krupensky and Schmidt, affiliating with their Committee for the Salvation of Bessarabia, whose activities were closely monitored by Romania's secret police, the Siguranța. According to the Moldavian Bloc's Petru Cazacu, <b>they</b> <b>answered</b> indirectly to Anton Denikin, commander of the Volunteer Army.|$|E
25|$|The verse form of Doctrinale in fact arose by accident. Alexander {{had been}} {{employed}} by the bishop of Dol-de-Bretagne to teach Latin to his nephews, using the grammar of Priscian. He had noticed that the boys could not remember Priscian as prose, so he translated its rules into verse form. When Alexander was away one day, the bishop asked his nephews a grammar question, and was surprised when <b>they</b> <b>answered</b> in verse. The bishop persuaded Alexander to compile and to publish an entire book of such verses, which became the Doctrinale.|$|E
5000|$|The {{woman will}} ask a {{potential}} victim [...] "Am I pretty?" [...] If <b>they</b> <b>answer</b> no, she will kill {{them with a}} pair of scissors, which she carries in her pocket. If <b>they</b> <b>answer</b> yes, she will pull away the mask, revealing that her mouth is slit from ear to ear, and ask, [...] "How about now?" [...] If <b>they</b> <b>answer</b> no, she will cut her unfortunate victim in half. If the person answers yes, then she will slit his or her mouth so it resembles her mouth. It is impossible to run away from her, as she will simply reappear in front of the victim.|$|R
50|$|The {{remaining}} 4 {{players are}} each given 60 seconds to answer as many questions as possible.

25|$|In 1883 the {{department}} {{first and only}} horse-drawn steam fire engine was purchased from the Ahrens-Fox Fire Engine Company of Cincinnati. The engine was brought up the Ohio River to Huntington on a steamboat. Also in 1883 {{the department}} was reorganized on a part-paid basis, but continued to be largely volunteer until 1897 when the department was again reorganized with a paid chief, four paid drivers and a force of firefighters who were paid by each alarm <b>they</b> <b>answered.</b> Each firefighter held down regular jobs {{the rest of the}} time. This was the beginning of Huntington's full-time paid fire department.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} points scheme, {{which was}} in operation from inception until 2001, consisted of three groups of ten questions. The first ten questions were worth three marks each, the next ten four marks each, and the last ten five marks each. Students were deducted {{a quarter of the}} marks for a given question if <b>they</b> <b>answered</b> incorrectly, so that a student randomly guessing the answers would gain no numerical benefit (on statistical average). Students started with 30 marks, so that a student who answered all questions incorrectly would record a total score of zero, while one who answered all questions correctly would record a score of 150.|$|E
25|$|Increasingly {{unable to}} control his muscles, Guthrie was hospitalized at Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital in Morris County, New Jersey, from 1956 to 1961, at Brooklyn State Hospital (now Kingsboro Psychiatric Center) in East Flatbush until 1966, and finally at Creedmoor Psychiatric Center in Queens Village, New York, {{until his death in}} 1967. Marjorie and the {{children}} visited Guthrie at Greystone every Sunday. <b>They</b> <b>answered</b> fan mail and played on the hospital grounds. Eventually a longtime fan of Guthrie invited the family to his nearby home for the Sunday visits. This lasted until Guthrie was moved to the Brooklyn State Hospital, which was closer to Howard Beach, NY, where Marjorie and the children then lived.|$|E

5000|$|Jesus says he {{will tell}} them if <b>they</b> <b>answer</b> him one question. [...] "John's baptism — was it from heaven, or from men? Tell me!" [...] (30) The priests are then trapped. Mark implies {{that they did not}} believe in John, so that if <b>they</b> <b>answer</b> from heaven people will ask why they did not believe John. If <b>they</b> <b>answer</b> from men, <b>they</b> would be in {{conflict}} with the people, who did believe in John. They therefore refuse to answer and accordingly so does Jesus. This allows him to make the priests look bad and incompetent and also allows him to imply to the people that his authority is from God without saying it.|$|R

25|$|Joshua {{told his}} {{officers}} {{to have the}} Israelites prepare food, for within three days they were to cross the Jordan to possess the land that God was giving them. Joshua told the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh to remember their commitment to Moses, whereby God would give them their land {{on the east side}} of the Jordan and their wives, children, and cattle would stay there, but the men would fight at the forefront of the Israelites until God gave the Israelites the land of Israel. <b>They</b> <b>answered</b> Joshua that they would follow his commands just as they had followed Moses. Whoever rebelled against Joshua's command would be put to death.|$|E
25|$|O'Donoghue hid {{a number}} of unused grenades on the farm {{and the two men}} went their {{separate}} ways. At about 2AM at least eight armed men entered the house and went upstairs into the brothers' bedroom. The brothers got up and stood at the bedside and were asked their names. When <b>they</b> <b>answered,</b> the gunmen opened fire. Both brothers were shot dead and their elderly relative, William Dunlea, was wounded by gunfire. According to Daniel Delaney, the father of the brothers, the gunmen wore long overcoats and spoke with English accents. It is thought that, while searching the site of the ambush, the Auxiliaries had found a cap belonging to one of the volunteers and had used bloodhounds to follow the scent to the Delaney home.|$|E
25|$|When the revolts began, Reynolds {{was asleep}} in her home in San Juan. At 2 A.M. she was awakened when more than forty armed policemen and National Guardsmen showed up at her doorstep. Even though {{they did not have}} a search warrant they {{proceeded}} to search the house, and confiscated her papers and speeches. When she asked them if they had a search warrant <b>they</b> <b>answered</b> that they didn't but that they did have an order to arrest her. The police claimed that their actions were justified under the provisions of the Gag Law (Law 53) of Puerto Rico, known as the Ley de la Mordaza. Reynolds was taken into custody along with Carmen María Pérez Roque and Olga Viscal Garriga. She was held for various days at police headquarters before she was transferred to La Princesa Prison.|$|E

Among those that followed David to Hebron to make him king were 50,000 fully armed men of Zebulun with no double heart (I Chronicles 12:33), who brought with them, as sign of their hearty allegiance, bounteous supplies of meat and drink to celebrate the accession of their new ruler (I Chronicles 12:41). When Hezekiah made reparation for the abominations of his father Ahaz, he invited all Israel to keep the Passover in the house of the Lord. Mockery and ridicule met the emissaries of the reformer; yet some were true to the religion of their fathers, and, even from far away Zebulun, went up to Jerusalem, destroyed the idols, and kept the feast of the unleavened bread (II Chronicles 30:10-23).|$|E

Tzara's melody, Vaseline symphonique ("Symphonic Vaseline"), which required ten or twenty people to shout [...] "cra" [...] and [...] "cri" [...] on a rising scale, was also performed. A scandal erupted when Breton read Picabia's Manifeste cannibale ("Cannibal Manifesto"), lashing out at the audience and mocking them, to which <b>they</b> <b>answered</b> by aiming rotten fruit at the stage.|$|E

500|$|Both {{his parents}} were {{interested}} in natural sciences, and <b>they</b> <b>answered</b> Dawkins's questions in scientific terms. Dawkins describes his childhood as [...] "a normal Anglican upbringing". He embraced Christianity until halfway through his teenage years, at which point he concluded that {{the theory of evolution}} was a better explanation for life's complexity, and ceased believing in a god. Dawkins states: [...] "the main residual reason why I was religious was from being so impressed with the complexity of life and feeling that it had to have a designer, and I think it was when I realised that Darwinism was a far superior explanation that pulled the rug out from under the argument of design. And that left me with nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|Users have {{reported}} that mephedrone causes euphoria, stimulation, an enhanced appreciation for music, an elevated mood, decreased hostility, improved mental function and mild sexual stimulation; these effects {{are similar to the}} effects of cocaine, amphetamines and MDMA, and last different amounts of time depending on the way the drug is taken. Of 70 Dutch users of mephedrone, 58 described it as an overall pleasant experience and 12 described it as an unpleasant experience. In a survey of UK users who had previously taken cocaine, most users found it produced a better-quality and longer-lasting high and was less addictive. The users were also asked to compare the [...] "risk", and <b>they</b> <b>answered</b> that it was equal. A study of users in Northern Ireland found they did not equate the fact that mephedrone was legal with it being safe to use. This was contrary to another study in New Zealand, where users of benzylpiperazine thought that because it was legal, it was safe.|$|E
