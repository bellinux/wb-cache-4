5000|$|The European section, {{which will}} cross Turkey, passing on to Greece and Italy. In Italy the {{pipeline}} would be split:the northern branch will run to Switzerland, Austria and Germany, while southern branch will supply France and Spain. [...] It {{is not clear}} if the <b>Trans-Adriatic</b> <b>Pipeline,</b> foreseen for Iran gas export to Europe, {{would be part of}} this project or not.|$|E
50|$|Azeriqaz, a sub-company of SOCAR, {{intends to}} ensure full {{gasification}} {{of the country}} by 2021.Azerbaijan {{is one of the}} sponsors of the East-West and North-South energy transport corridors. Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway line will connect the Caspian region with Turkey, is expected to be completed in July 2017. The Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP) and <b>Trans-Adriatic</b> <b>Pipeline</b> (TAP) will deliver natural gas from Azerbaijan’s Shah Deniz gas to Turkey and Europe.|$|E
40|$|In the Balkans, European {{countries}} {{and the rest of}} the world fought fierce battles over who will control the gas pipelines, which means not only financial benefits but also powerful geopolitical positions of the countries. After the failure of two major Balkan gas pipelines – the project “South Stream” and “Nabucco”, the project TAP (<b>Trans-Adriatic</b> <b>Pipelines)</b> definitely won the battle, becoming the largest gas project in the Balkans in the last 100 years. This project will turn Albania into a very important energy artery in Europe. This will significantly affect the dynamics of the economic development of Albania, creating over 15 thousand new jobs with the pipeline in the next five years and over a billion euros will be gained from tax transition in the next 20 years. TAP Project is currently predicted to have two branches of its own. The first one is the branch tube which will be connected to the main TAP pipeline in Greece and will continue through Bulgaria (180 kilometers long), and is also expected to continue through Romania and Hungary towards Central Europe. The other branch, the so-called – IAP (Ionian-Adriatic Pipeline), will supply Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, while an additional branch of it will pass through Macedonia and Kosovo. There is no dilemma that this project will be very important not only for the development of the region, but also for its stabilization and integration...|$|R
50|$|SOCAR {{leadership}} {{estimates that}} with further drilling, the overall reserves at Umid {{are likely to}} reach 300 bcm while those of Babek field lying under Umid will reach 600 bcm. Drilling at Babek will also be done by SOCAR. The Azerbaijan's total gas reserves are estimated at 3 to 5 trillion cubic meters (tcm). The discovery will boost Azerbaijan's potential as gas exporter to Western countries through the European evacuation route, i.e. <b>Trans-Adriatic</b> <b>pipeline</b> or Nabucco West pipeline.|$|E
5000|$|The {{project is}} being {{developed}} by a consortium of six companies. Preparations started in 2002 and the intergovernmental agreement between Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Austria was signed on 13 July 2009. After an announcement {{of the construction of}} TANAP, the consortium has submitted the Nabucco-West project. [...] Construction of Nabucco-West depended on the gas export route decision by the Shah Deniz consortium. [...] After Shah Deniz consortium decision to prefer the <b>Trans-Adriatic</b> <b>Pipeline</b> over Nabucco, Nabucco's shareholders have to decide the next steps for the project.|$|E
5000|$|The Southern Gas Corridor is an {{initiative}} of the European Commission for the natural gas supply from Caspian and Middle Eastern regions to Europe. The main goal of the Southern Gas Corridor is to reduce Europe's dependency on Russian gas. [...] The route from Azerbaijan to Europe consist of the South Caucasus Pipeline, the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline, and the <b>Trans-Adriatic</b> <b>Pipeline.</b> [...] The total investment of this route is estimated US$45 billion. [...] The main supply source would be the Shah Deniz gas field, located in the Caspian Sea.|$|E
50|$|In 2005 Azerbaijan {{exported}} 50% {{of its oil}} to Italy. The {{owner of}} a 5% share in the Contract of the Century, an Italian company Eni-Agip, {{is involved in the}} construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline. A number of other companies in Italy also participated {{in the construction of the}} pipeline on the basis of the contract. The official opening ceremony was held in July 2006. Eni-Agip is also active in the project Shahdeniz and in the oil field Kyurdashy. In June 2013, it was decided that the <b>Trans-Adriatic</b> <b>Pipeline</b> (TAP) will go from Azerbaijan through Turkey and Greece to southern Italy.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a framework for}} analyzing in quantitative and monetary terms the macroeconomic effects associated with the construction and operation of large energy investments, including the impact on Gross Domestic Product (GDP), employment and public revenues, by sector of economic activity. The proposed framework has been implemented for analyzing the macroeconomic implications associated with the construction and operation of the <b>Trans-Adriatic</b> <b>Pipeline</b> (TAP) project in Greece. To this end, the input-output methodological framework {{has been used for}} estimating the macroeconomic implications of the project under consideration in conjunction with the adjusted earnings gain approach for monetizing the resulting employment effects. The results of the analysis clearly show that the construction activities will create significant direct, indirect and induced benefits to the Greek economy, growing the GDP by 2 ̆ 0 ac 931 million, creating employment benefits amounted to 2 ̆ 0 ac 197 million and contributing 2 ̆ 0 ac 359 million to the treasury. Furthermore, it was estimated that ongoing operation of the pipeline could increase the national GDP at about 2 ̆ 0 ac 17 million, the employment benefits of about 2 ̆ 0 ac 4. 7 million and the tax revenues of approximately 2 ̆ 0 ac 6. 8 million, on an annual basis and for a period of 50 years...|$|E
