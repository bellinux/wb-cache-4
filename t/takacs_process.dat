40|$|We {{present a}} model for spike-driven {{dynamics}} of a plastic synapse, suited for a VLSI implementation. The synaptic device behaves as a capacitor on short time scales, and preserves the memory of two stable states (efficacies) on long time scales. The transitions (LTP/LTD) are stochastic because both the number {{and the distribution of}} neural spikes in any finite (stimulation) interval fluctuate, even at fixed pre- and post-synaptic spike rates. The dynamics of the single synapse is studied analytically by extending the solution to a classic problem in queuing theory (<b>Takacs</b> <b>process).</b> The model of the synapse is implemented in aVLSI, and consists of only 18 transistors. It is also directly simulated. The simulations indicate that LTP/LTD probabilities vs rates are robust to fluctuations of the electronic parameters {{in a wide range of}} rates. The solutions for these probabilities, are in very good agreement both with the simulations and with measurements. Moreover, the probabilities ar [...] ...|$|E
