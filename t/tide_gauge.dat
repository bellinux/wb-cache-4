5|$|FitzRoy's {{instructions}} set {{detailed requirements}} for geological survey of a circular coral atoll to investigate how coral reefs formed, {{particularly if they}} rose {{from the bottom of}} the sea or from the summits of extinct volcanoes, and to assess the effects of tides by measurement with specially constructed gauges. FitzRoy chose the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean, and on arrival there on 1 April 1836, the entire crew set to work, first erecting FitzRoy's new design of a <b>tide</b> <b>gauge</b> that allowed readings to be taken from the shore. Boats were sent all around the island to carry out the survey, and despite being impeded by strong winds, they took numerous soundings to establish depths around the atoll and in the lagoon. FitzRoy noted the smooth and solid rock-like outer wall of the atoll, with most life thriving where the surf was most violent. He had great difficulty in establishing the depth reached by living coral, as pieces were hard to break off and the small anchors, hooks, grappling irons, and chains they used were all snapped off by the swell as soon as they tried to pull them up. He had more success using a sounding line with a bell-shaped lead weight armed with tallow hardened with lime; this would be indented by any shape that it struck to give an exact impression of the bottom; it would also collect any fragments of coral or grains of sand.|$|E

25|$|Recently, it {{has become}} widely {{accepted}} that late Holocene, 3,000 calendar years ago to present, sea level was nearly stable prior to an acceleration of rate of rise that is variously dated between 1850 and 1900 AD. Late Holocene rates of sea level rise have been estimated using evidence from archaeological sites and late Holocene tidal marsh sediments, combined with <b>tide</b> <b>gauge</b> and satellite records and geophysical modeling. For example, this research included studies of Roman wells in Caesarea and of Roman piscinae in Italy. These methods in combination suggest a mean eustatic component of 0.07mm/yr for the last 2000 years.|$|E
25|$|Global {{sea level}} change {{for much of}} the last century has {{generally}} been estimated using <b>tide</b> <b>gauge</b> measurements collated {{over long periods of time}} to give a long-term average. More recently, altimeter measurementsnbsp&— in combination with accurately determined satellite orbitsnbsp&— have provided an improved measurement of global sea level change. To measure sea levels prior to instrumental measurements, scientists have dated coral reefs that grow near the surface of the ocean, coastal sediments, marine terraces, ooids in limestones, and nearshore archaeological remains. The predominant dating methods used are uranium series and radiocarbon, with cosmogenic radionuclides being sometimes used to date terraces that have experienced relative sea level fall. In the early Pliocene, global temperatures were 1–2˚C warmer than the present temperature, yet sea level was 15–25 meters higher than today.|$|E
40|$|The {{redistribution}} of surface water mass {{associated with the}} melting of glacial ice causes uplift near areas of mass depletion, depression of the seafloors, {{and changes in the}} earth's gravitational field which perturb the ocean surface. As a result, local spatial variations exist in the rate of sea level rise. <b>Tide</b> <b>gauges</b> on continental coastlines measure a sea level rise 5 % smaller than the global average. <b>Tide</b> <b>gauges</b> in the hemisphere opposite a source of continental mass depletion measure sea level rise 10 to 20 % greater than the global average produced by that source while satellites make measurements 10 % too low. Because most long duration <b>tide</b> <b>gauges</b> are in the northern hemisphere, if the sources of sea level rise are unbalanced between the two hemispheres, estimates of global sea level rise could be in error by 10 to 20 %. Individual <b>tide</b> <b>gauges</b> could be more seriously unrepresentative if they are near regions of significant present-day mass depletion. United States.

500|$|Hurricane Isabel {{first began}} {{affecting}} North Carolina about 15hours before it struck land. Upon making landfall along the Outer Banks, the hurricane produced strong waves of 15 to 25feet (4.5 to 6m) in height and a storm surge of about 6 to 8feet (1.8 to 2.4m). Waters reached {{a height of}} [...] in Hatteras. Storm tides along the coast peaked at 7.7feet (2.3m) in Cape Hatteras, though the total could be higher there due to the <b>tide</b> <b>gauge</b> being destroyed by the hurricane. The surge and waves created a new inlet by washing out a portion of Hatteras Island between Hatteras and Frisco. Unofficially named Isabel Inlet, the break was 2,000feet (600m) wide and 15feet (5m) deep, and consisted of three distinct channels. The formation of the inlet destroyed a portion of North Carolina Highway 12, and also washed out three homes, dunes, power lines, and utility pipes. The new inlet destroyed all utility connections to Hatteras Village, isolating the residents there. The storm surge and waves from Isabel also resulted in a breach between Hatteras and Hatteras Inlet. The breach, which nearly became an inlet, formed from the flow of ocean water across the island, {{though it was not}} deep enough for a constant water flow. The breach occurred in an area without roads or houses, and had little impact on Hatteras residents. Rough surf and storm surge caused overwash and severe beach erosion throughout the Outer Banks, with flooding in Ocracoke reportedly being up to waist-high. The hurricane produced an estimated 4inches (100mm) of rain throughout most of the Outer Banks, with Duck reporting a peak of 4.72inches (120mm). Wind gusts in association with the hurricane peaked at 105mph (170km/h) in Ocracoke, with several other locations reporting hurricane-force gusts.|$|E
