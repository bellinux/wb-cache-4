50|$|In {{this rare}} type of aphasia, Broca's area, Wernicke's area, and the arcuate {{fasciculus}} are intact but the watershed region around them is damaged. This damage isolates these areas {{from the rest}} of the brain. The most frequent etiology of mixed <b>transcortical</b> <b>aphasia</b> is stenosis (narrowing) of the internal carotid artery. Mixed <b>transcortical</b> <b>aphasia</b> can also occur after cerebral hypoxia, cerebral swelling, and any stroke that affects the cerebral artery. Often lesions that cause mixed <b>transcortical</b> <b>aphasia</b> affect both the anterior and posterior perisylvian border zones. Some times the type of aphasia can be determined just by knowing the lesion location. In order for a patient to be diagnosed with mixed <b>transcortical</b> <b>aphasia</b> all other forms of transcortical must be ruled out. Using WAB or the BDAE can rule out global aphasia if the ability to repeat is present. If verbal fluency is depressed <b>transcortical</b> <b>aphasia</b> gets ruled out and if auditory processing and comprehension is weak then it cannot be transcortical motor aphasia.|$|E
5000|$|Mixed <b>transcortical</b> <b>aphasia</b> is {{characterized}} by severe speaking and comprehension impairment, but with preserved repetition. [...] People who suffer mixed <b>transcortical</b> <b>aphasia</b> struggle greatly to produce propositional language or {{to understand what is}} being said to them, yet they can repeat long, complex utterances or finish a song once they hear the first part. Persons with mixed <b>transcortical</b> <b>aphasia</b> are often nonfluent, and in most cases do not speak unless they are spoken to, do not comprehend spoken language, cannot name objects, and cannot read or write. However, they often have the ability to repeat what is said to them. In fact, persons with mixed <b>transcortical</b> <b>aphasia</b> often repeat in a parrot-like fashion. Some patients with this disorder can experience many different types neurological symptoms including, bilateral paralysis, lack of voluntary speech, and difficulty with producing spontaneous speech.|$|E

5000|$|For most patients, {{formal and}} {{informal}} language assessments are initially administered during his/her acute hospital stay by a licensed speech-language pathologist. However, a standardized assessment may provide further information regarding an aphasia classification. While there are different classifications of aphasia (i.e., Broca’s, Wernicke’s, Conduction, Anomia), they each have hallmark deficits. Research has shown, a patient presenting with mixed <b>transcortical</b> <b>aphasia</b> will have impairments in all communicative areas, {{with the exception of}} the preserved ability to repeat a person’s words or phrases. [...] Patients with mixed <b>transcortical</b> <b>aphasia</b> demonstrate similar deficits as those seen in patients with global aphasia. Therefore, assessment of repetition is most critical in order to differentially diagnose.Specifically, language based standardized assessments such as the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB), and the Folstein Mini Mental State Exam include a repetition subtest amongst all other language-related areas.|$|E
5000|$|Mixed <b>transcortical</b> <b>aphasia</b> is {{the least}} common of the three transcortical aphasias (behind transcortical motor aphasia and transcortical sensory aphasia, respectively). This type of aphasia can also be {{referred}} to as [...] "Isolation Aphasia". This type of aphasia is a result of damage that isolates the language areas (Broca’s, Wernicke’s, and the arcuate fasciculus) from other brain regions. Broca’s, Wernicke’s, and the arcuate fasiculus are left intact; however, they are isolated from other brain regions.|$|E

40|$|Mixed <b>transcortical</b> <b>aphasia</b> is a {{very rare}} {{syndrome}} characterized by intact repetition, despite severe impairment in all other language modalities. In some cases, however, preservation of repetition is accompanied by intact reading. We report {{the case of a}} left-handed man who, after a subcortical stroke in the left hemisphere, showed the typical features of mixed <b>transcortical</b> <b>aphasia</b> with spared repetition and reading. After 10 days, a second stroke, involving the anterior insula and adjacent white matter bundles, markedly deteriorated repetition while his reading abilities recovered. By comparing features of repetition and reading before and after the second stroke, we provide evidence for the existence of a modular organization of language abilities, pointing to the primary role of the insula and surrounding white matter in phonological processing...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY A {{patient with}} atrial {{fibrillation}} and {{internal carotid artery}} occlusion developed mixed <b>transcortical</b> <b>aphasia.</b> The CT scan showed two recent distinct infarcts in the dominant hemisphere, one in the precentral artery area (pial artery infarct) {{and one in the}} borderzone area between the posterior and middle cerebral arteries territories (watershed infarct). The perisylvian speech areas were spared, but probably disconnected from other areas by the infarcts. The syndrome of isolation of speech area may be caused by vascular conditions which are able to produce simultaneous pial artery and watershed infarcts, and is not necessarily related to more extensive processes of the brain...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Transcortical</b> sensory <b>aphasia</b> is {{characterized}} as a fluent aphasia. Fluency is determined by direct qualitative observation of the patient’s speech to determine the length of spoken phrases, and is usually characterized by a normal or rapid rate; normal phrase length, rhythm, melody, and articulatory agility; and normal or paragrammatic speech. <b>Transcortical</b> sensory <b>aphasia</b> is a disorder {{in which there is}} a discrepancy between phonological processing, which remains intact, and lexical-semantic processing, which is impaired. Therefore, patients can repeat complicated phrases, however they lack comprehension and propositional speech. This disconnect occurs since Wernicke’s area is not damaged in patients with TSA, therefore repetition is spared while comprehension is affected. Patients with intact repetition can repeat both simple and complex phrases spoken by others, e.g. when asked if the patient would like to go for a walk, he or she would respond [...] "go for walk." [...] Although patients can respond appropriately, due to the extent of their TSA, it is most likely that they do not comprehend what others ask them. In addition to problems in comprehension, <b>transcortical</b> sensory <b>aphasia</b> is further characterized based on deficits in naming and paraphasia.|$|R
50|$|In his work, Goldstein studied <b>transcortical</b> sensory <b>aphasia</b> (TSA), characterizing it as {{impaired}} auditory comprehension, with intact {{repetition and}} fluent speech.

40|$|An unusual {{combination}} of disconnective syndromes is reported: <b>transcortical</b> motor <b>aphasia,</b> left arm apraxia and optic ataxia. Neuropathological examination showed a left parieto-occipital and a subcortical frontal infarct and a lesion of the dorsal {{part of the}} posterior two-fifths of the callosum. The frontal lesion caused the <b>transcortical</b> motor <b>aphasia</b> and produced the left arm apraxia. Visuomotor incoordination in the right hemispace {{was due to the}} left parieto-occipital infarct, while the crossed optic ataxia in the left hemispace was attributed to the callosal lesion. It is proposed that the pathway that serves crossed visual reaching passes through the dorsal part of the posterior callosum. This case reinforces the growing evidence that fibres in the corpus callosum are arranged in ventro-dorsal functional lamination...|$|R
40|$|Aphasia is {{a common}} manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), and {{investigation}} of the linguistic disorders of CJD patients may provide insights into the neurobiological mechanisms of language and aphasia. We report an autopsy-confirmed case of CJD in which the presenting symptom was change in language abilities. The patient ultimately evidenced mixed <b>transcortical</b> <b>aphasia</b> (MTA) with echolalia. Disruption of frontal-subcortical circuits with environmental dependency accounts for the symptoms in MTA, including intact repetition and echolalia. Observation in this patient and {{a review of the}} literature suggest that frontal-subcortical circuit dysfunction may contribute to the syndrome of echolalia. This hypothesis offers an alternative explanation to “isolation” of the speech area as the cause of MTA...|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the classic form of alexia without agraphia, subangular alexia results from a single lesion located deep in the white matter of the left parietal lobe. In the present report, a patient with subangular alexia and features of mixed <b>transcortical</b> <b>aphasia</b> is described. Neurolinguistic findings include: alexia without agraphia, paucity of spontaneous speech, moderate auditory comprehension difficulty, excellent repetition, echopraxia, colour agnosia, and naming disorder. Neurolinguistic tests revealed intact phonological organisation and grammatical filter. " Our studies revealed a "double disconnection syndrome," the co-existence of two relatively rare neurobehavioural disorders. Furthermore, the studies reported here clearly show dissociations of language functions in both the visual and auditory modality, which demonstrates that the stages of language processing are separable...|$|E

25|$|Individuals with <b>transcortical</b> motor <b>aphasia</b> {{have similar}} deficits as {{expressive}} aphasia, except repetition ability remains intact.

25|$|In all {{of these}} ways, TSA {{is very similar to}} a more {{commonly}} known language disorder, receptive <b>aphasia.</b> However, <b>transcortical</b> sensory <b>aphasia</b> differs from receptive aphasia in that patients still have intact repetition and exhibit echolalia, or the compulsive repetition of words. <b>Transcortical</b> sensory <b>aphasia</b> cannot be diagnosed through brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), as the results are often difficult to interpret. Therefore, clinicians rely on language assessments and observations to determine if a patient presents with the characteristics of TSA. Patients diagnosed with TSA have shown partial recovery of speech and comprehension after beginning speech therapy. Speech therapy methods for patients with any subtype of aphasia are based on the principles of learning and neuroplasticity. Clinical research on TSA is limited because it occurs so infrequently in patients with aphasia that {{it is very difficult to}} perform systematic studies.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} deals with {{sentence}} repetition in MB, an Italian patient with mixed <b>transcortical</b> <b>aphasia.</b> In preliminary testing, MB spontaneously resisted accurate repetition {{when presented with}} sentences featuring morphosyntactic violations (see Davis et al., 1978). MB also managed to repeat all the proposed phrasal chunks, even in complex sentences. Interestingly, MB tended to move the constituents with the violation (always oblique arguments/adjuncts) {{to the beginning of}} the sentence or to another non-canonical position (e. g., dislocating adjuncts immediately before verbs). Thus, he selectively performed “adjunct scrambling”. A detailed experimental task confirmed that MB only moved adjuncts or optional complements. Interestingly, most of the scrambled constituents were prosodically-marked by pitch-peaks as contrastive foci. We argue that MB resorts to scrambling as a syntactic strategy. In doing so, he activates projections that encode information related to the interface between syntax and discourse-pragmatics...|$|E
40|$|Two {{cases of}} aphasia after right hemispheric stroke in right handed {{patients}} are described. The first patient had a severe mixed <b>transcortical</b> <b>aphasia,</b> apraxia and neglect after a lesion involving the right lenticular nucleus and periventricular white matter; aphasia was still present after three months. The second patient had a mild, transient fluent aphasia after a small right hemispheric periventricular lesion. Studies with [18 F]FDG and {{positron emission tomography}} (PET) showed functional depression extending to the structurally unaffected left hemisphere in both patients in the acute stage. After three months, in the patient with persistent aphasia, metabolism was still reduced in the right hemisphere, with some recovery of hypometabolism on the left, while metabolic values had returned to normal in the patient with full language recovery. A close parallelism between glucose metabolism and clinical course in crossed aphasia is shown, {{as well as the}} presence of a functional involvement of the structurally unaffected left hemisphere in the acute stage...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The arcuate {{fasciculus}} (AF) is a {{key component}} for language repetition Neuroimaging evidence indicates a gender-dimorphic architecture of this white matter tract. Strong left lateralization of the direct segment of the AF is m∼ore frequent in men (85 %), while mild lateralization or symmetrical bilateral ∼ representation (60 %) is more prevalent amongst women. Therefore, most men {{do not have a}} well-developed right AF. This predicts that men with aphasia and left hemisphere damage will have less capacity than aphasic women to compensate repetition deficits and, consequently, aphasias associated to repetition deficits (e. g conduction aphasia – CA) will be more prevalent in men. While this assumption is intuitively appealing, it has not been empirically tested up to now. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of published cases of CA and <b>transcortical</b> <b>aphasia</b> (TA) was performed. Adult patients with first-ever unilateral cerebrovascular event and no prior history of neurological or psychiatric disease were included in the database. The men: women proportion of CA and TA was calculated from the database, and compared with the men:women proportion of stroke prevalence. The group of patients with aphasias showing relatively preserved repetition (transcortical motor and sensory aphasias) was used as control. Patients with mixed <b>transcortical</b> <b>aphasia</b> were excluded because repetition is not fully preserved. Results: Two hundred fifty three publications were included, gathering 799 cases of CA and TA. Males accounted for 74 % (n = 375) of CA subjects (n = 507), while among TA (n= 249, mixed TA excluded) men represented 62 % (n= 154) of subjects. Compared with 59 % of male prevalence in stroke, men were overrepresented amongst CA (p< 0. 0001, 95 % CI 68. 91 to 76. 82) in comparison with the control group (TA with exclusion of mixed TA, p= 0. 2848, 95 % CI 55. 50 to 67. 91). Discussion:Chronic repetition deficits are more prevalent in men than in women. This finding has important implications for the diagnosis and rehabilitation of aphasia in men, since verbal repetition is a major resource in language therapy. References: Catani M et al.

40|$|We {{present a}} case of <b>transcortical</b> mixed <b>aphasia</b> caused by a {{cerebral}} embolism. A 77 -year-old right-handed man was admitted to our hospital with speech disturbance and a right hemianopia.

However, repetition of phonemes and sentences and reading aloud were fully preserved. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed cerebral infarcts in the left frontal and parieto-occipital lobe which included the inferior frontal gyrus and angular gyrus, single photon emission CT revealed a wider area of low perfusion over the entire left hemisphere except {{for part of the}} left perisylvian language areas. The amytal (Wada) test, which was performed via the left internal carotid artery, revealed that the left hemisphere was dominant for language. Hence, it appears that <b>transcortical</b> mixed <b>aphasia</b> may be caused by the isolation of perisylvian speech areas, even if there is a lesion in the inferior frontal gyrus, due to disconnection from surrounding areas. 5 page(s...|$|R
