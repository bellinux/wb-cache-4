5|$|The {{video is}} {{split into two}} {{sections}} and switches between them throughout. The first has band members Homme, Nick Oliveri and Mark Lanegan driving a truck at night, whereupon <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> deer. When they get out to inspect, the deer proceeds to attack them before going on a rampage in their International Harvester Scout. The second section of the video is of Homme, Oliveri, Troy Van Leeuwen and Dave Grohl performing the song against a black background.|$|E
5|$|When a {{raindrop}} {{hits the}} interior of the cup with the proper angle and velocity it can produce considerable force, and can create a splash that drives the water up along the sides of the cup (also known as splash cups), tearing the funiculus, and ejecting the peridioles. The peridioles are followed by their funicular cord and basal hapteron. When <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> nearby plant stem or stick, the hapteron sticks to it, and the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole (similar to a tetherball). The peridiole, attached to the plant, may be eaten by herbivorous mammals, and the subsequent passage through its digestive tract will soften the hard shell enough to facilitate later sporulation.|$|E
25|$|The Right Answer: Two {{conservative}} commentators (played by Rick Mercer and Greg Thomey) debate {{various issues}} in the news. When one of them makes a point, <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> chess timer. Discontinued when Mercer left the show.|$|E

Curry rejoined the gang, and <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> Great Northern train near Wagner, Montana on July 3. This time, they took over $60,000 in cash. Gang member Bill Carver was killed in Sonora, Texas by Sutton County Sheriff Elijah Briant during the pursuit {{following}} that robbery.|$|E
25|$|Some species {{explicitly}} {{adapt to}} tidal flux. In Roscoe Bay, jellyfish ride the current at ebb tide until <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> gravel bar, and then descend below the current. They remain in still waters until the tide rises, ascending and {{allowing it to}} sweep {{them back into the}} bay. They also actively avoid fresh water from mountain snowmelt, diving until they find enough salt.|$|E
25|$|All the {{electrons}} {{move in a}} straight line due to the high-voltage difference across the plates, which preserves collimation, and where one or two electrons entered, thousands may emerge. A separate (lower) charge differential accelerates the secondary electrons from the MCP until <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> phosphor screen {{at the other end of}} the intensifier, which releases a photon for every electron. The image on the phosphor screen is focused by an eyepiece lens. The amplification occurs at the microchannel plate stage via its secondary cascaded emission. The phosphor is usually green because the human eye is more sensitive to green than other colors and because historically the original material used to produce phosphor screens produced green light (hence the soldiers' nickname 'green TV' for image intensification devices).|$|E
50|$|So {{could the}} {{movement}} of the container cause the disturbance? Consider the barges that bring water into Venice. When <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>an</b> obstacle, the water rushes forward; when they speed up it will go to the back. For all this disturbance {{there is no need for}} new water and the level in the middle stays largely constant though the water there rushes backwards and forwards.|$|R
5000|$|On each round, one {{square on}} the board is {{randomly}} chosen as the crime scene, and the players {{have to figure out}} how to get a Meeple there to solve the crime. The twist in the game is that the Meeples do not move freely, instead they use [...] "Super Speed", where once they move, they don't stop until <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>an</b> obstacle (a wall, the edge of the board, or another Meeple).|$|R

25|$|As an {{electron}} enters a magnetic field, it feels a Lorentz force and corkscrews. The radius of this motion is the gyroradius. As it moves it loses some energy as x-rays, {{every time it}} changes speed. The electron spins faster and tighter in denser fields, as it enters the MaGrid. Inside the MaGrid, single electrons travel straight through the null point, due to their infinite gyroradius in regions of no magnetic field. Next, they head towards {{the edges of the}} MaGrid field and corkscrew tighter along the denser magnetic field lines. This is typical electron cyclotron resonance motion. Their gyroradius shrinks and when <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> dense magnetic field they can be reflected using the magnetic mirror effect. Electron trapping has been measured in polywells with Langmuir probes.|$|E
500|$|Criticism of his {{perceived}} long-ball tactics became more intense as he managed West Ham United in the Premier League, including discontent from West Ham's own supporters. In January 2014, following a 0–0 draw at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea manager, José Mourinho criticised West Ham's football, likening it to [...] "football from the 19th century". In October 2014, Allardyce claimed {{his reputation for}} playing long ball football was [...] "not founded in fact" [...] and had been used as an excuse by opposing managers such as Arsène Wenger, David O'Leary, Graeme Souness and Rafael Benítez following defeats by sides managed by Allardyce. Allardyce wrote in his autobiography that [...] "when <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> 50-yard ball it was a cultural pass; when we did it, it was a hopeful hoof".|$|E
500|$|During the {{recording}} sessions {{for his second}} album, tentatively named [...] "Life After Death... 'Til Death Do Us Part", later shortened to Life After Death, Wallace {{was involved in a}} car accident that shattered his left leg and temporarily confined him to a wheelchair. The injury forced him to use a cane. He and Lil' Cease were arrested for smoking marijuana in public and had their car repossessed. Wallace chose a Chevrolet Lumina rental SUV as a substitute, despite [...] Lil' Cease's objections. The vehicle had brake problems before the accident but Wallace dismissed them. According to Lil' Cease, Wallace's leg was shattered when <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> rail along with Lil's Cease's jaw. Wallace spent months in a hospital following the accident and had to complete therapy. Despite his hospitalization, he continued to work on the album. The accident was referred to in the lyrics of [...] "Long Kiss Goodnight": [...] "Ya still tickle me, I used to be as strong as Ripple be / Til Lil' Cease crippled me." ...|$|E

50|$|The new bombsight {{is being}} tested in Hawaii, and Lynx {{intercepts}} a Boeing 314 Clipper {{on the way to}} Honolulu. After it is shot down, Bob and his secretary Mary Blake (Kathryn Adams) were rescued by a government cutter. Lieutenant Carry (Robert Armstrong) and Tim meet the survivors but find that Lynx has sent his henchmen to finish the job. The foreign agents are killed when <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>an</b> oncoming truck. Mary announces that she has become Mrs. Dayton.|$|R
50|$|A {{randomized}} {{approach to}} this problem, and probably the most practical one, is based on trapezoidal decomposition, or trapezoidal map. A trapezoidal decomposition is obtained by shooting vertical bullets going both up and down from each vertex in the original subdivision. The bullets stop when <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>an</b> edge, and form a new edge in the subdivision. This way, we obtain {{a subset of the}} slab decomposition, with only O(n) edges and vertices, since we only add two edges and two vertices for each vertex in the original subdivision.|$|R
500|$|Tank is a two-player maze game {{in which}} the players, each {{controlling}} a tank, attempt to shoot each other. The maze {{is a set of}} blocks set at right angles to each other with an empty square central area all viewed from above; the shape of the maze is not symmetric, and is the same between games. One of the tank sprites is white and the other is black, while the central area is filled with black X marks representing land mines. The tanks can fire shells, which destroy the other tank if they hit; tanks are also destroyed if <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> land mine. The destruction of a tank grants the opposing player a point and causes a brief explosion and accompanying sound, during which time the other tank cannot shoot, before restoring the tank at the same position. Destroyed land mines do not return. Points are displayed above the play area, and flash during the final twenty seconds of the round. The game continues until the time runs out, after which the player with the higher point value wins the match. Each game typically costs a quarter and lasts for 60 seconds, but an internal toggle adjusts it to two quarters and 120 seconds. [...] The time can be further adjusted by operators.|$|E
500|$|A neo {{soul and}} R album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill {{incorporates}} musical styles such as soul, hip hop, and reggae. Some songs {{are based in}} hip hop soul. [...] "When It Hurts So Bad" [...] is musically old roots reggae mixed with soul. While mostly in English, [...] "Forgive Them Father" [...] and [...] "Lost Ones" [...] both feature singing in patois, which is the common dialect in Jamaica. Although heavily R, the song [...] "Superstar" [...] contains an interpolation of the rock song [...] "Light My Fire" [...] by The Doors. Hill said that she [...] "didn't {{want to come out}} with a [...] type of sound", but create [...] "something that was uniquely and very clearly a Lauryn Hill album." [...] She also said that she did not intend for the album's sound to be commercially appealing: [...] "There's too much pressure to have hits these days. Artists are watching Billboard instead of exploring themselves. Look at someone like Aretha, she didn't hit with her first album, but she was able to grow up and find herself. I wanted to make honest music. I don't like things to be too perfect, or too polished. People may criticize me for that, but I grew up listening to Al Green and Sam Cooke. When <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> high note, you actually felt it." ...|$|E
500|$|Charles Ellet and {{his team}} tied a heavier line to the kite string and pulled the joined lines across. [...] They pulled {{successive}} heavier and stronger lines across until the final bridge cable— thick—was hanging across the gorge. [...] The cable was suspended between two wooden towers [...] tall, and it was attached to an iron basket. Ellet planned to use this system as a basket ferry to shuttle workers and materials across the gorge, saving time that {{would otherwise have been}} spent on land and ferry travel. [...] Through media coverage and word-of-mouth, many people knew of Ellet's efforts and flocked to the site to watch the construction. [...] On March 13, 1848, the system was completed, and the team planned to test it by pulling the empty basket across. [...] <b>They</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> snag when the basket kept getting stuck halfway and could not move ahead. [...] Pulling back the basket, Ellet decided to assure the watching crowd that the system was workable. [...] He stepped into the basket, and it moved towards the opposite shore. [...] When Ellet reached the problematic spot, he spotted the issue; the basket's rollers could not pass over a portion of the cable that had been accidentally flattened during the construction. [...] He fixed the problem and proceeded to cross to the Canadian side and back, becoming the first person to cross the gorge. [...] Although the bridge companies had prohibited Ellet from collecting tolls, he charged each person $1.00 for the chance to [...] "observe first hand the engineering wonder of bridging the Niagara". [...] On some days, the basket ferry conveyed up to 125 people across the gorge.|$|E

50|$|Ray casting is a {{technique}} in which a ray for every vertical slice of the screen is sent from {{the position of the}} camera. These rays shoot out until <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>an</b> object or wall, and that part of the wall is rendered in that vertical screen slice. Early first-person shooters used ray casting as {{a technique}} to create a 3D effect from a 2D world. While the world appears 3D, the player cannot look up or down, nor actually move on the Y axis, because the playing field is 2D.|$|R

6000|$|And {{then comes}} the {{question}} of private judgment. [...] "I thought so-and-so would happen. Therefore, I did thus and thus." [...] Things {{may or may not}} turn out as anticipated, but that is merely another of the million chances of the sea. Take a case in point. A flotilla of our destroyers sighted six (there had been eight the previous afternoon) German battleships of Kingly and Imperial caste very early in the morning of the 1st June, and duly attacked. At first our people ran parallel to the enemy, then, as far as one can make out, headed them and swept round sharp to the left, firing torpedoes from their port or left-hand tubes. Between them <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> battleship, which went up in flame and débris. But one of the flotilla had not turned with the rest. She had anticipated that the attack would be made on another quarter, and, for certain technical reasons, she was not ready. When she was, she turned, and single-handed--the rest of the flotilla having finished and gone on--carried out two attacks on the five remaining battleships. She got one of them amidships, causing a terrific explosion and flame above the masthead, which signifies that the magazine has been touched off. She counted the battleships when the smoke had cleared, and there were but four of them. She herself was not hit, though shots fell close. She went her way, and, seeing nothing of her sisters, picked up another flotilla and stayed with it till the end. Do I make clear the maze of blind hazard and wary judgment in which our men of the sea must move? ...|$|E
