50|$|Teliospore (sometimes called <b>teleutospore)</b> is the {{thick-walled}} resting spore of some fungi (rusts and smuts), {{from which}} the basidium arises.|$|E
40|$|It was {{suggested}} by Professor J. A. MacDonald that a study {{be made of}} problems related to the life cycles of the rusts Puccinia magnusiana Körnicke and P. phragmitis (Schum.) Körnicke. Initial observations in the field led to investigations on the respective host ranges of the two species and on the factors governing survival and germination of their <b>teleutospores,</b> acidio-spores and uredospores. ” – from the Introduction...|$|R
40|$|The {{work began}} with an {{endeavour}} to find a technique for inoculating the host plants of the Uredineae with single sporidia of their specific rust, with precision and certainty. This has been achieved, and single sporidia have been isolated {{by means of the}} microdissection apparatus of Dr. Chambers. The most favourable conditions for sporidial infection were then determined, and cultures kept under controlled conditions. The rust used was Puccinia malvacearum, chosen because its <b>teleutospores</b> germinate immediately they are ripe so that a constant supply is available over a long period. This facilitated preliminary experimentation. Results show that this fungus is homothallic: a single sporidium being sufficient to cause infection, and the production of <b>teleutospores.</b> This was to be expected since there is no pycnidium or aecidium in the life cycle. The method of Inoculation has universal application for the rusts and it is hoped to demonstrate this at once in a long cycled form. Reviewing the literature on Puccinia malvacearum several problems in the life-cycle were found to be as yet unsolved. A study of the complete life history by means of examination of infections of known age, made under controlled conditions, has helped to elucidate these points. Infected plants in the field have also been under observation day by day throughout the winter, {{to solve the problem of}} hibernation. The results from these experiments show that there is a retardation in the cycle consequent on the less frequent occurrence of suitable conditions for germination and infection, but new infections do occur whenever these favourable conditions prevail. <p...|$|R
50|$|Wheat leaf rust spreads via {{airborne}} spores. Five {{types of}} spores are {{formed in the}} life cycle. Uredospores, <b>teleutospores,</b> and basidiospores develop on wheat plants and pycnidiospores and aeciospores develop on the alternate hosts. The germination process requires moisture, and works best at 100% humidity. Optimum temperature for germination is between 15-20 °C. Before sporulation, wheat plants appear completely asymptomatic. In the Asian Subcontinent, the spores cannot survive the hot, dry weather but are re-introduced every year from the Himalayas or surrounding hills, possibly coming from Berberis spp, Thalictrum flavum and Muehlenbergia huglet which is a main reason for bread mouldes or even some grasses. Wheat rust pathogens are biotrophic and require living plant cells to survive.|$|R
40|$|Penetration of {{the host}} and {{development}} of the sorus of the smut Cintractia axicola on plants of Fimbristylis dichotoma and Cyperus rotundas was studied. Following germination of the <b>teleutospores</b> dikaryotic hyphae of promycelial origin penetrate the epidermis of the peduncle directly. From the point of penetration mycelium spreads mostly intracellularly through the tissues {{of the host}}. The cells of the epidermis become filled with monokaryotic mycelium which constitutes the fungal sheath. Internal to the epidermis, mycelium which is dikaryotic accumulates first in the subepidermal cells and then progressively occupies tissues of the peduncle. A stroma, pockets of sporogenous tissue, and a columella form. Nuclear fusion occurs in developing spores at the time they are differentiated from the parent hyphae. Sori may form in florets, groups of florets, or whole spikelets. The mode of differentiation of hyphae giving rise to sheath, stroma, spores, and columella is the same as described for sori which form at the bases of peduncles...|$|R
