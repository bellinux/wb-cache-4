It remains customary for Indian Hindu women of childbearing age to wear a nose stud, usually in the left nostril, due to the nostril's association with the female reproductive organs in Ayurvedic medicine. This piercing is sometimes done the night before the woman marries.|$|E

5|$|Originally under Colonel J. V. B. Jervis-Read, the {{department}} {{suffered from a}} lack of authority and resources. In December 1943, Jervis-Read was replaced by Colonel Noel Wild, a member of <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>eastern</b> 'A' Force deception department, and expanded dramatically. Wild split {{the department}} into Operations and Intelligence sections. Lieutenant Colonel Roger Fleetwood-Hesketh retained charge of the latter, and Wild placed Jervis-Read in command of the former. Fleetwood-Hesketh immediately expanded his staff, bringing in his brother, an MI5 liaison officer and a secretary. The operations section was not expanded until May, with three American officers and Major S. B. D. (Sam) Hood (another 'A' Force alumnus) joining the department.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and educated}} in Victoria, McNamara {{was a teacher}} {{when he joined the}} militia prior to World WarI. In 1915, he was {{selected}} for pilot training at Central Flying School, Point Cook, and transferred to the Australian Flying Corps the following year. He was based in <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Eastern</b> Theatre with No.1 Squadron when he earned the Victoria Cross. In 1921, McNamara enlisted as a flying officer in the newly formed RAAF, rising to the rank of air vice marshal by 1942. He held senior posts in England and Aden during World WarII. Retiring from the Air Force in 1946, McNamara continued to live in Britain until his death from heart failure in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Operation Ferdinand formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military deception {{intended to}} confuse the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. During early 1944 {{the main thrust of}} deceptions in <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Eastern</b> theatre were contained under Operation Zeppelin (including its sub-plan Vendetta), which developed threats against Greece and Southern France, and Operation Royal Flush, which ran political deceptions against Spain and Turkey. On 14 June the Allies committed to a landing in Southern France, codenamed Operation Dragoon (formerly Anvil). Royal Flush and Zeppelin were scaled back, to tone down the threat to France, and it was decided a new plan (Ferdinand) was required to cover the intended invasion.|$|E

5|$|The British yeomanry {{units that}} had fought {{dismounted}} at Gallipoli were reinforced and reorganised, forming the 74th (Yeomanry) Division and {{a portion of}} the 75th Division. Along with the Australian Light Horsemen and New Zealand Mounted Rifles remounted and reorganised into the Anzac Mounted Division, infantry from the 52nd (Lowland) Division, 42nd (East Lancashire) Division, 53rd (Welsh) Division and 54th (East Anglian) Division, later joined by additional remounted Australian Light Horsemen and British yeomanry from the Australian Mounted Division, participated in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. The Egyptian Sinai was reoccupied in 1916, while Palestine and the northern Levant were captured from the Ottoman Empire during 1917 and 1918, before the Armistice of Mudros ended hostilities in <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Eastern</b> theatre on 31 October. The Allies subsequently occupied Gallipoli and Constantinople and partitioned the Ottoman Empire. The occupation ended in 1923.|$|E
5|$|The next Standard History was the Book of Han, {{compiled}} by Ban Biao (354 CE), his son Ban Gu (3292 CE), {{and his daughter}} Ban Zhao (45116 CE). Unlike Sima's private and independent work, this history text was commissioned and sponsored by the Han court under Emperor Ming (r. 5775 CE), who let Ban Gu use the imperial archives. This set a significant precedent {{for the rest of}} the Standard Histories, since the historian was now virtually unable to criticize his ruling patron. The Book of Han covered the history of China left off from Sima's work during Emperor Wu's reign up until <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>Eastern</b> Han. Although the Records of the Three Kingdoms included events in late Eastern Han, no history work focused exclusively on the Eastern Han period until the Book of Later Han was {{compiled by}} Fan Ye (398445 CE).|$|E
5|$|Through 1944 'A' Force {{was slowly}} winding down. Clarke was {{involved}} in planning Operation Bodyguard, a major cover plan for the Allied landing in Normandy, and he was tasked with executing the (largely political) deceptions in <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Eastern</b> region. However, {{by the end of}} the summer 'A' Force's usefulness in operations had reached its end. On 13 October Clarke held a party (true to form, at a Cairo cinema) for the remaining members of the department. Command of the remaining tactical deceptions was transferred to Caserta. Clarke, along with a skeleton staff, remained in Egypt to tie up the loose ends of various operations and to begin his history of the department. In April 1945, Clarke left Cairo for London; on 18 June he called a meeting of the remaining 'A' Force members at the Great Central Hotel where the department was disbanded.|$|E

5|$|In 1972, France {{was able}} to gain a {{contract}} with Saudi Arabia over the purchase of 190 AMX-30S', designed for the desert environment of <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Eastern</b> nation. Named the Palmier Contract, Saudi Arabia's tanks were delivered between 1973 and 1979, while 59 AMX-30Ds were exported between 1975 and 1979, 12 AMX-30Ps between 1977 and 1979, and finally 51 self-propelled howitzers, delivered between 1979 and 1980. Between 1979 and 1981, Saudi Arabia also received 52 AMX-30SAs and later 50 AMX-30C1 Shanine-2s delivered in two batches, between 1980 and 1989. By the 21st century, 50% of Saudi Arabia's AMX-30 fleet were in storage, given that the AMX-30 lacked the capabilities to deal with more modern threats, such as against Iraqi T-62s and T-72s, and Israeli Merkava tanks. These were largely displaced by an order for 315 M1A2 Abrams tanks in 1989, and the acquisition of 450 M60A3 Patton tanks. Although Saudi Arabia planned to procure more M1 tanks, it was {{unable to do so}} for financial reasons and the AMX-30 has still not been retired.|$|E
5|$|Raised {{to acting}} {{squadron}} leader, Steege was given {{command of the}} newly arrived No.450 Squadron at Rayak, Lebanon, on 31May 1941. The assignment was a challenging one, as the operational requirements of existing forces, and the RAAF Air Board's insistence on staffing ArticleXV squadrons such as No.450 with Australian Empire Air Training Scheme aircrew rather than Permanent Air Force members, meant that the unit was short of experienced pilots. Steege was mentioned in despatches on 24September 1941 for his leadership of the squadron. By December, it was at nominal strength and equipped with P-40 Kittyhawks; it commenced combat operations out of Gambut and ElAdem, Libya, and began registering victories in February 1942. Steege himself scored a confirmed victory over a Messerschmitt Bf109 on 28March. His final tally in <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Eastern</b> theatre was eight enemy aircraft destroyed, two probables and five damaged. He returned to Australia a temporary wing commander in December 1942.|$|E
5|$|The {{congregation}} initially {{consisted of}} only ten families and met in several temporary locations {{before moving to}} a permanent building. These locations included a house on 24th Avenue and 9th Street, a room above Carney's Grocery Store, and Sheehan Hall. In this interim period, the congregation grew to include 50 members by 1878, with David Burgheim serving as rabbi. <b>The</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Eastern</b> style building {{at the corner of}} 8th Street and 22nd Avenue, constructed by the growing congregation in 1879, was the first building in the city with gas-powered lighting. Rabbi Burgheim was succeeded by Rabbi W. Weinstein, then Rabbi Jacobs, and then Rabbi Judah Wechsler. Wechsler, who became rabbi in 1887, led a movement to provide public schools for blacks, which culminated in a bond issue to construct the first brick public school building for African Americans in the state. The Wechsler School was named after him and has since been listed on the National Register of Historic Places and as a Mississippi Landmark. The congregation stayed in this building for several years, before eventually being forced to move due to complaints of flies attracted by horse droppings outside of a nearby retail store.|$|E
