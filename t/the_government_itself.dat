5|$|Return to {{economic}} growth and improved structural deficits enabled Ireland and Portugal to exit their bailout programmes in July 2014. Greece and Cyprus both managed to partly regain market access in 2014. Spain never officially received a bailout programme. Its rescue package from the ESM was earmarked for a bank recapitalization fund and did not include financial support for <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shortly thereafter, {{an update}} to the SEOC Act, the Child Protection Act of 1984, made {{it illegal to}} {{purchase}} pornographic materials depicting minors through the mail, or possess them, {{on the grounds that}} it encouraged child sexual abuse. While popular with voters, civil liberties advocates warned that the expanded scope of these laws could result in prosecutions of entirely innocent people who had little or nothing to do with the child-porn industry, such as parents taking photos or videos of their children in the nude. Nevertheless, investigators forged ahead and had, by the mid-1980s, shut down almost all domestic child-porn production. <b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>itself</b> was thereafter the biggest marketer, in the form of materials it created to tempt buyers.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that man is a social animal, Saint-Just argues that in nature {{there is no need for}} contracts, legislation, or acts of force. These constructs only become necessary when a society is in need of moral regeneration and serve merely as unsatisfactory substitutes for the natural bonds of free people. Such constructs permit small groups to assume unwarranted powers which, according to Saint-Just, leads to corruption within society. Because a return to the natural state is impossible, Saint-Just argues for a government composed of the most educated members of society, who could be expected to share an understanding of the larger social good. Outside <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>itself,</b> Saint-Just asserts there must be full equality between all men, including equal security in material possessions and personal independence. Property must be protected by the state but, in order to secure universal independence, all citizens (including women) must own property.|$|E

25|$|The {{term was}} also used by <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>itself,</b> the press and colloquially to mean the {{executive}} branch alone, as the branch of the government was responsible for day-to-day governance of the nationwhen a Premier headed or formed a government.|$|E
25|$|Where {{legislative}} channels {{have been}} unresponsive, some citizens {{have turned to}} the courts to address social issues more quickly. For instance, in the 1990s, individuals, and eventually <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>itself,</b> sued tobacco companies over the health risks of cigarette smoking. The 1998 Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement provided states with long-term payments to cover medical costs to treat smoking-related illnesses.|$|E

25|$|In June 2004, {{under the}} auspices of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546 the Coalition {{transferred}} limited sovereignty to a caretaker government, whose first act was to begin the trial of Saddam Hussein. The government began the process of moving towards elections, though the insurgency, and the lack of cohesion within <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>itself,</b> led to repeated delays.|$|E
25|$|On 15 July 2016, a coup d'état was {{attempted}} by the military, with aims {{to remove}} Erdoğan from government.

Reportedly, no government official was arrested or harmed, which among other factors raised the suspicion of a false flag event staged by <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 1880s, the larger shipyards turned to {{government}} contracts for assistance in weathering the slump, while <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>itself</b> was keen to expand the Navy. Smaller Philadelphia shipyards like Neafie & Levy, however—mindful both of the rigorous conditions placed on Navy contracts, and of the recent example of an established shipyard bankrupted by such a contract—preferred other solutions.|$|E

25|$|In many cases, {{such as the}} cabinet-directed {{prohibition}} on foreign ownership for broadcasters and the legislated principle of the predominance of Canadian content, these acts and orders often leave the CRTC less room to change policy than critics sometimes suggest, {{and the result is}} that the commission is often the lightning rod for policy criticism that could arguably be better directed at <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
25|$|Instead, 1946 was {{witnessed}} to {{an exceptionally}} severe drought, turned into famine over some areas. PCR officials claimed {{that this had}} been worsened by administrative incompetence, which had led to insufficient supplies of wheat and bread at the central level, and to various irregularities in transport over the national railway system (in turn attributed to sabotage). Kavtaradze blamed <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>itself</b> for the confusing situation.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of Azad Hind was essentially coterminous with the {{existence of}} the Indian National Army. While <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>itself</b> continued until the civil administration of the Andaman Islands was returned to the jurisdiction of the British {{towards the end of the}} war, the limited power of Azad Hind was effectively ended with the surrender of the last major contingent of INA troops in Rangoon.

25|$|By August 2007 the MNJ claimed defections {{from the}} army had {{increased}} their numbers to over 2000 fighters. Some sources claim that defections included the entire Niger Rapid Intervention Company, a special forces unit trained by the United States Military to conduct anti-terrorist operations in 2003–2006. There have also been reports that this same unit {{had been used to}} guard the mining operations in Arlit by the French mining conglomerate Areva NC, or that it (and the rebel movement) had been created by <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>itself</b> in order to ratchet up tension in the region and thereby secure Western military aid.|$|E
25|$|In December 2011, Syria {{agreed to}} an Arab League {{initiative}} allowing Arab observers into the country. Thousand of people gathered in Homs to greet them, but the League suspended the mission in January 2012, citing worsening violence. Twin suicide bomb attacks outside security buildings in Damascus killed 44 people in December 2011. This {{was the first in}} a series of bombings and suicide attacks in the Syrian capital that continued throughout 2012. The opposition accuses <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>itself</b> of staging the attacks. The government accuses the Western media of turning a blind eye to the rebels' use of al-Qaeda-style terrorist attacks.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, Saudi {{leadership}} did not emphasize {{its identity}} as inheritor of the Wahhabi legacy as such, {{nor did the}} descendants of Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab, the Al ash Shaykh, continue to hold the highest posts in the religious bureaucracy. Wahhabi influence in Saudi Arabia, however, remained tangible in the physical conformity in dress, in public deportment, and in public prayer. Most significantly, the Wahhabi legacy was manifest in the social ethos that presumed government responsibility for the collective moral ordering of society, from the behavior of individuals, to institutions, to businesses, to <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E

25|$|After Osanlou was {{dismissed}} from the United Bus Company of Tehran along with seventeen other activists in mid-2005, the bus operators movement started to gain momentum. Osanlou’s popularity amongst workers and his charismatic appeal were {{important factors in}} making him the rallying point for alienated labourers. Worker disdain led to rumblings of strike action and revolt, but such thoughts were quelled by reactionary security forces organized by the company and <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>itself.</b> During {{one of the many}} engagements in May, Osanlou was taken into custody after being treated for injuries. He was later released. Pressure from the theocratic regime to dissolve future activities by the union was largely unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|The Kingdom of Laos {{emerged from}} the First Indochina War {{independent}} of the French, but {{in a state of}} chaos. Even as the French pulled out of Laos, the Americans took up their advisory role to the Royal Lao Government through such agencies as the Programs Evaluation Office (PEO). Meanwhile, North Vietnamese communists and Lao communists were active in Laos, sowing discontent against the government. <b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>itself</b> was in turmoil, as various Laotian military leaders and politicians scrambled for positions of power. The American government became convinced that Laos could not be allowed to fall under communist control, lest other countries in Southeast Asia follow suit.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{the issue}} of the Constitution and its {{provisions}} was also brought up by several politicians within <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>itself.</b> Lim Keng Yaik of the Gerakan party, which by now had joined Barisan Nasional, the ruling coalition, asked for a re-examination of the social contract so that a Bangsa Malaysia (literally 'Malaysian race' or 'Malaysian nation' in the Malay language) could be achieved. The social contract is the Constitution's provisions with regard to the different races' privileges—those who defend it and Article 153 often define the social contract as providing the Indians and Chinese with citizenship in exchange for the Malays' special rights or ketuanan Melayu.|$|E
