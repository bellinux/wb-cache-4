5|$|One of the {{key points}} {{stressed}} in this interpretation is that salvation is an individual experience difficult to communicate <b>to</b> <b>outsiders.</b> In his depiction of Camelot, the poet reveals a concern for his society, whose inevitable fall will bring about the ultimate destruction intended by God. Gawain was written {{around the time of}} the Black Death and Peasants' Revolt, events which convinced many people that their world was coming to an apocalyptic end and this belief was reflected in literature and culture. However, other critics see weaknesses in this view, since the Green Knight is ultimately under the control of Morgan le Fay, often viewed as a figure of evil in Camelot tales. This makes the knight's presence as a representative of God problematic.|$|E
5|$|Weyard {{is governed}} by the mythological concept of the {{classical}} elements. All matter on Weyard consists of any combination of the four base elements: Venus, Mars, Mercury and Jupiter, or earth, fire, water, and wind, respectively. These four building blocks of reality can be manipulated by the omnipotent force of Alchemy, which reigned supreme in the world's ancient past. Alchemy was sealed away in the past, however, and {{the world in the}} present age has become seemingly devoid of this power. However, in various places throughout the world, people demonstrate an aptitude to manipulate one of the elements through a form of magic called Psynergy. These wielders of Psynergy, called Adepts, usually refrain from displaying their talents <b>to</b> <b>outsiders.</b>|$|E

5|$|As {{late as the}} mid-1970s, Doi Mae Salong was {{strictly}} off-limits <b>to</b> <b>outsiders.</b> Since 1994, Santikhiri has capitalised on its unique history and has developed into a tourist attraction, with its narrow winding streets lined with inns, noodle shops and teashops. As a result, Santikhiri {{has become one of}} Thailand's top ten destinations among backpackers today. The former soldiers had settled down, some of them having married ethnic Chinese brides who crossed the border after the fighting stopped, and others having married local Thais. The old soldiers carry on their normal lives peacefully now, but still retain their Chinese identity; the main language spoken remains Yunnanese. Among their local-born descendants, some have adopted a Thai identity and no longer identify with their Chinese ancestry. As of 2007, General Lue Ye-tien, aged 90 and Tuan's former right-hand man, {{is the leader of the}} group, after taking over the leadership on Tuan's death in 1980.|$|E
5|$|The NAACP hired Elisabeth Freeman, a women's {{suffrage}} activist from New York City, {{to investigate}} the lynching. She had traveled to Texas in late 1915 or early 1916 to help organize the suffrage movement there. After attending a suffrage convention in Dallas in early May, she began her assignment in Waco, posing as a journalist and attempting to interview people about the lynching. She found that almost all residents were reluctant to discuss the event. She spoke with town officials and obtained pictures of the lynching from Gildersleeve, who was initially reluctant to provide them. Although she feared for her safety, she enjoyed {{the challenge of the}} investigation. When speaking with city leaders, Freeman convinced them that she planned to defend Waco against criticism when she returned to the north. Some journalists soon grew suspicious of her presence and warned residents not to talk <b>to</b> <b>outsiders.</b> Local African Americans, however, gave her a warm reception.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{performance}} of privatized and state firms in the transition economies of Central Europe, while controlling for various forms of selection bias. It argues that privatization has different effects depending on the types of owners to whom it gives control. In particular, privatization <b>to</b> <b>outsider,</b> but not insider, owners has significant performance effects. Where privatization is effective, the effect on revenue performance is very pronounced, {{but there is no}} comparable effect on cost reduction. Overlooking the strong revenue effect of privatization <b>to</b> <b>outsider</b> owners leads <b>to</b> a substantial overstatement of potential employment losses from postprivatization restructuring. © 2000 the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology...|$|R

25|$|The {{failure of}} the Spanish to control the north coast left the region open <b>to</b> <b>outsiders</b> who were {{prepared}} {{to work with the}} local people against Spanish interests, and thus northern Europeans began trading and eventually settling in the northern areas during the various wars between England, the Netherlands and Spain of the period 1580 to 1625.|$|E
25|$|In pre-colonial times, {{the rules}} of {{customary}} law in {{much of what is}} today Malawi attributed the ownership of land to the African communities that occupied it.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} how basic moral sensitivity in bullying, moral disengagement in bullying and defender self-efficacy were related to different bystander behaviors in bullying. Therefore, we examined pathways that linked students' basic moral sensitivity, moral disengagement, and defender self-efficacy to different bystander behaviors in bullying situations. Three hundred and forty-seven teenagers completed a bullying survey. Findings indicated that compared with boys, girls expressed higher basic moral sensitivity in bullying, lower defender self-efficacy and moral disengagement in bullying. Results from the SEM showed that basic moral sensitivity in bullying was negatively related to pro-bully behavior and positively related <b>to</b> <b>outsider</b> and defender behavior, mediated by moral disengagement in bullying, which in turn was positively related to pro-bully behavior and negatively related <b>to</b> <b>outsider</b> and defender behavior. What differed in the relations between outsider and defender behaviors was the degree of defender self-efficacy...|$|R

Mafiosi from Cleveland, Philadelphia, New England, Buffalo and other cities would visit Salerno to talk about various internal problems they wanted resolved.

25|$|During a 1944 Red Cross visit, {{and in a}} {{propaganda}} film, the Nazis presented Theresienstadt <b>to</b> <b>outsiders</b> as a model Jewish settlement, {{but it was a}} concentration camp.

Whereas some survivors claimed the prison population reached 75,000 at one time, according to official records, the highest figure reached (on September 18, 1942) was 58,491. They were crowded into barracks designed to accommodate 7,000 combat troops.|$|E

40|$|Increased {{integration}} and growing macroeconomic fluctuations require {{more attention to}} be paid to the link between the ”noise ” that these fluctuations represent and the company’s own development. For many reasons management must weed out the effects of the ”noise ” so as to obtain a clear picture of the long-term sustainable profits, and thus a picture of how the company’s intrinsic competitiveness is fostered. An understanding {{of the effects of the}} fluctuations also provides the basis for risk assessment. How far, then, should this “new ” view of corporate performance be extended <b>to</b> <b>outsider</b> shareholders? Current reporting practice does not provide these shareholders with an adequate idea of the character and magnitude of the macroeconomic impact on the company. IAS 1 (rev. 1997) indicates that an improvement in this important area may be in the offing. This paper discusses four different interpretational levels of this standard and what these levels mean in terms of relevant information transmitted <b>to</b> <b>outsider</b> shareholders...|$|R

25|$|Individuals will readily used {{displaced}} dissent {{regardless of}} the focus or triggering event. External audiences provide individuals with a low-risk alternative to express dissent.

If an employee expresses their dissent <b>to</b> <b>outsiders,</b> the organization will not hear about it and will assume that less dissent exists within the organization. When an organization fails to address potential issues, employees may then view the organization as discouraging dissent and will resort to using either latent or displaced dissent in the future.|$|E
25|$|During the 1994 all-race elections, some Coloured {{people voted}} for the white National Party. The National Party recast itself as the New National Party, partly to attract non-White voters. This {{political}} alliance, often perplexing <b>to</b> <b>outsiders,</b> has sometimes been {{explained in terms of}} the culture and language shared by White and Coloured New National Party members, who both spoke Afrikaans. In addition, both groups opposed affirmative action programmes that might give preference to non-Coloured Black people, and some Coloured people feared giving up older privileges, such as access to municipal jobs, if African National Congress gained leadership in the government.|$|E
