50|$|Sprytrons {{are often}} {{designed}} similar to trigatrons, with the <b>trigger</b> <b>electrode</b> coaxial to the cathode. In one design the <b>trigger</b> <b>electrode</b> is formed as metallization {{on the inner}} surface of an alumina tube. The trigger pulse causes surface flashover, which liberates electrons and vaporized surface discharge material into the inter-electrode gap, which facilitates formation of a vacuum arc, closing the switch. The short switching time suggests electrons from the trigger discharge and the corresponding secondary electrons knocked from the anode as the initiation of the switching operation; the vaporized material travels too slowly through the gap to play significant role. The repeatability of the triggering can be improved by special coating of the surface between the <b>trigger</b> <b>electrode</b> and the cathode, and the jitter can be improved by doping the trigger substrate and modifying the trigger probe structures. Sprytrons can degrade in storage, by outgassing from their components, diffusion of gases (especially hydrogen) through the metal components, and gas leaks through the hermetic seals; an example tube manufactured with internal pressure of 0.001 Pa will exhibit spontaneous gap breakdowns when the pressure inside rises to 1 Pa. Accelerated testing of storage life {{can be done by}} storing in increased ambient pressure, optionally with added helium, for leak testing, and increased temperature storage (150 &deg;C) for outgassing testing.

To switch the device, a high voltage pulse is delivered to the <b>triggering</b> <b>electrode.</b> This ionizes the medium between it {{and one of the}} main electrodes, creating a spark which shortens the thickness of non-ionized medium between the <b>electrodes.</b> The <b>triggering</b> spark also generates ultraviolet light and free electrons in the main gap.

Different materials like epoxy resin, Teflon (PTFE) and mica have been used. The trigger voltage was found to vary in the range 560 - 1840 V.

40|$|A 6. 1 -MV, 0. 79 -MA laser-triggered gas switch (LTGS) {{is used to}} {{synchronize}} the 36 modules of the Z {{machine at}} Sandia National Laboratories. Each module includes one switch, which serves as the last command-fired switch of the module, and hence is {{used to determine the}} time at which each module electrically closes relative to the other modules. The switch is ∼ 81 -cm in length, ∼ 45 -cm in diameter, and is immersed in mineral oil. The outer switch envelope consists of six corrugated monomer-cast acrylic insulators and five contoured stainless-steel rings. The <b>trigger</b> <b>electrodes</b> are fabricated from copper-infused tungsten. The switch is pressurized with several atmospheres of sulfur hexafluoride (SF_{ 6 }), which is turbulently purged within 2  seconds after every shot. Each switch is powered from a 6 -MV, 0. 78 -MJ Marx generator which pulse charges a 24 -nF intermediate-store water capacitor in 1. 4 -μs. Closure of the switch allows power to flow into pulse-forming transmission lines. The power pulse is subsequently compressed by water switches, which results in a total accelerator output power in excess of 70 -TW. A previous version of the LTGS performed exceptionally at a 5. 4 -MV, 0. 7 -MA level on an engineering test module used for switch development. It exhibited a 1 -σ jitter of ∼ 5 [*][*]ns, a prefire and flashover rate less than 0. 1 %, and a lifetime in excess of 150 shots. When installed on the Z accelerator, however, the switch exhibited a prefire probability of ∼ 3 %, a flashover probability of ∼ 7 %, and a 15 -ns jitter. The difference in performance is attributed to several factors such as higher total charge transfer, exposure to more debris, and more stressful dynamic mechanical loading upon machine discharge. Under these conditions, the replacement lifetime was less than ten shots. Since refurbishment of Z in October  2007, there have been three LTGS design iterations to improve the performance at 6. 1 -MV. The most recent design exhibits a prefire rate of less than 0. 1 %, a flashover rate of ∼ 0. 2 %, a single switch jitter of ∼ 6 -ns, and a lifetime of greater than 75 shots.

The repetition rate can be changed between 0 and 300 Hz. The new arc evaporator can operate with an averaged arc current as high as 1000 A.

40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{recent research}} on phenomena of spatiotemporal self-organisation in electrochemical systems. It is written {{from the viewpoint}} of electrocatalysis exemplified by the electrocatalytic oxidation of formic acid (HCOOH) and methanol (CH 3 OH). First, the electro-oxidation of carbon monoxide was studied, since CO oxidation is an important elementary step in the HCOOH and CH 3 OH oxidation. A rough Ru (0001) surface has higher catalytic activity for CO oxidation compared with the flat Ru (0001) electrode due to active defects of the surface. In formic acid oxidation on a Pt ring electrode, reversible transitions between standing waves and travelling pulses were observed when the potential or the concentration of formic acid near the ring electrode were used as control parameters. We also found the anti-phase resp. in-phase edge oscillations on a thin Pt ribbon electrode, when the reference electrode was close to (resp. far away from) the ribbon working electrode. The edge of the ribbon tended to be in a more passive state (high potential) compared with the centre. A surprising experimental observation is phase resetting and controlled pulse reversal induced by external perturbation via a <b>trigger</b> <b>electrode</b> at one location of the ring. Usual phase resetting was obtained for small amplitude perturbations, while stronger perturbations resulted in reversal of the direction of the travelling pulse (i. e., from clockwise to anti-clockwise and vice versa). All spatiotemporal experimental observations are in very good agreement with theoretical simulations carried out with a reaction-migration model and can be rationalized in terms of short-range positive and long-range negative migration coupling. The experimental proof of a hidden negative differential resistance oscillator in methanol oxidation suggested that a higher thermodynamic efficiency of a direct methanol fuel cell could be possible by applying autonomous and/or externally driven potential oscillations with appropriate frequency...|$|E
40|$|Spatiotemporal pattern {{formation}} {{through the}} interplay of chemical reactions and electrical effects is a wide-spread phenomenon. It occurs at biological membranes (e. g., in nerve cells and muscle tissue), but has been most extensively studied in electrochemistry. The present work discussed self-organized spatiotemporal behavior in nonlinear electrochemical systems as exemplified by the electrocatalytic oxidation of formic acid on Pt. The most important quantity for the kinetics of any electrochemical reaction is the interfacial potential (or double layer potential) at the electrode/electrolyte interface. It also constitutes an essential variable for almost all nonlinear phenomena observed in electrochemical systems. In this environment, the equations describing spatiotemporal patterns of interfacial potential are composed of a local (reaction) term and a part describing the spatial coupling through the electric field in the electrolyte. The spatial coupling through the electric field is termed migration coupling, and consequently, {{the evolution of the}} double layer potential is said to be described by a reaction-migration equation (RME). Different geometries of the electrode setup give rise to different coupling properties. Using a ring as working electrode (sufficiently narrow to neglect radial patterns), all points of the working electrode are equivalent and affected equally by the external control as long as the reference electrode is placed symmetrically {{in the center of the}} ring; the sign of the long-range coupling is determined by the vertical distance between working and reference electrode. In contrast, on a ribbon electrode not all points are equivalent, moreover the coupling function diverges at the edges due to electrostatic effects. The symmetry of a ring electrode was broken in the present work by either asymmetric placing of the reference electrode changing the local properties without introducing singularities in the coupling, or by insulating parts of the ring which introduces edge effects similar to the ribbon electrode while otherwise essentially preserving the equivalence of points along the azimuthal direction. The experiments on pattern formation under galvanostatic or potentiostatic conditions were carried out with the formic acid oxidation on platinum electrodes in the presence of bismuth ions (Bi 3 +) which enhanced the oxidation of formic acid at low potential and led to the high current oscillations over a broad potential region. In chapter 3 potential oscillations in the electrocatalytic oxidation of formic acid with and without bismuth ions on a Pt ring electrode were investigated for symmetric geometry under galvanostatic conditions. Period-doubling and chaos (Feigenbaum scenario) were observed at fixed current. Characterization of the resulting chaotic attractors clearly suggested a Shil’nikov homoclinic orbit in the temporal behavior, at the same time the ring electrode remained always strictly in phase, demonstrating the occurrence of purely temporal chaos. In chapter 4 an asymmetric condition was imposed on the ring electrode by removing the reference electrode from the central axis. We studied the effect of the asymmetrically placed reference electrode in the bistable and oscillatory regime. The transitions between active and passive state in the bistable regime were very similar to the symmetric situation, but in addition asymmetry-induced double metastability was obtained. New types of patterns were observed in the oscillatory region. Apart from periodic, spatially inhomogeneous oscillations, complex aperiodic behavior with more and less prolonged quiescent phases were observed. The latter phases are probably indicative of many coexisting attractors predicted earlier [34]. A ribbon electrode (chapter 5) has different dynamic regimes because the local effective resistance and the migration coupling depend on the different positions of the ribbon. Since the local effective resistance is smallest at the edges of the ribbon electrode, the local function diverges and the coupling strength increases at the edges. Using a short distance between reference and working electrode, transitions via front propagation from passive to active states could be induced by a <b>trigger</b> <b>electrode</b> placed at one end of the ribbon, both locally and (by reversing the sign of the perturbation) at the opposite edge (remote triggering). For identical parameters, transitions from the active to the passive state as well as vice versa could be triggered (asymmetry-induced double metastability). Anti-phase edge oscillations for different positions of the reference electrode could be rationalized in terms of negative coupling and local inhomogeneity. On the other hand, in-phase edge oscillations were detected when the reference electrode was located far from the ribbon electrode, attributed to positive coupling. An asymmetrically placed reference electrode led to a patterned oscillation in which one side of the electrode oscillated with a frequency twice as high as the other side of electrode. Chapter 6 focused on a pure edge effect, i. e., insulated areas were introduced on an otherwise symmetric arrangement of the ring electrode and their effect on the pattern formation investigated. The basic pattern sequence for a symmetric ring (standing waves, travelling pulses, anti-phase oscillations with increasing voltage) had its analogues on ring electrodes which had 1, 2, or 3 small symmetrically placed insulated areas. Spontaneous emergence of active fronts always occurred at maximum distance from the conductor/insulator edges, in agreement with ribbon electrodes. Oscillations in-phase or out-of-phase at adjacent edges were comparable too, but differed in their relative parameter values from similar results on a ribbon. Some patterns on partially insulated ring electrodes did not have a counterpart in either ring or ribbon systems. These include period-doubled pulses and trapped oscillatory states, as well as the local velocity changes of travelling pulses due to the influence of the insulated parts. For not too broad insulated areas, travelling pulse waves accelerated near the insulators and jumped across them (saltatory conduction). This can readily be attributed to the fact that the coupling rises (and actually diverges) at a conductor/insulator interface. Consequently a pulse approaching an insulated area coupled very strongly to those parts of the electrode adjacent to the insulator and activated (or passivated) them much more rapidly than in regions far away from the insulated part. These findings may be of interest for certain biological systems (such as myelinated nerve axons). The aim of the present work was to provide experimental evidence for the influence of the geometry and symmetry of the electrode setup on the dynamics of electrochemical reactions. The results were achieved by studying HCOOH electro-oxidation on Pt using different geometries of the working electrode, different electrode arrangements, and the introduction of symmetry-breaking insulated areas...|$|E

40|$|Mean-field {{theories}} {{claim that}} the capacitance of the double-layer formed at a metal/ionic conductor interface cannot be larger {{than that of the}} Helmholtz capacitor, whose width is equal to the radius of an ion. However, in some experiments the apparent width of the double-layer capacitor is substantially smaller. We propose an alternate, non-mean-field theory of the ionic double-layer to explain such large capacitance values. Our theory allows for the binding of discrete ions to their image charges in the metal, which results in the formation of interface dipoles. We focus primarily on the case where only small cations are mobile and other ions form an oppositely-charged background. In this case, at small temperature and zero applied voltage dipoles form a correlated liquid on both contacts. We show that at small voltages the capacitance of the double-layer is determined by the transfer of dipoles from one electrode to the other and is therefore limited only by the weak dipole-dipole repulsion between bound ions, so that the capacitance is very large. At large voltages the depletion of bound ions from one of the capacitor <b>electrodes</b> <b>triggers</b> a collapse of the capacitance to the much smaller mean-field value, as seen in experimental data.

The new electrode concept lies between the classic “wet” and “dry” electrodes, allowing addressing most of their drawbacks, while keeping the advantages of both. A localized skin hydration effect at the electrode/scalp contact point is achieved by the release of a small amount of a moisturizing agent (30 l) from a reservoir inside the <b>electrode,</b> <b>triggered</b> by the electrode/scalp adduction. The electrode’s functionality relies on the polymer mechanical properties and on the design of an electrode reservoir that deforms upon the application of a specified adduction force.

The new electrode prototype proved to be able to monitor EEG signals {{similar to those of the}} commercial silver/silver chloride electrodes by using a fraction of the hydrating solution necessary for the commercial electrodes, thus avoiding to damage or dirtying the patient’s hair. Furthermore, due to the small amount of moisturizing agent employed, the risk of conductive bridges between adjacent electrodes due to gel running is considerably reduced.
