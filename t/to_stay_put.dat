5|$|At {{the same}} time the attack on the city would mark {{the first time that the}} revolutionary army would confront federal forces in a regular battle rather than relying on guerrilla tactics. While the fusion of Madero's, Villa's and Orozco's men did result in a number of troops {{sufficient}} to form a force capable of fighting professional soldiers in pitched encounters, the federal troops still had the advantage in terms of training and discipline. The government, in fact, had a good chance of squashing the rebels by moving troops down from the state capital of Ciudad Chihuahua and capturing Madero in a pincer movement. However, the Díaz-appointed governor of the state, Miguel Ahumada, was worried that if the soldiers abandoned the capital unrest would break out and the insurrection would spread. As a further sign of the apparent demoralization of federal rank-and-file soldiers (many of whom had been forcibly conscripted and actually sympathized with the revolutionaries), the troops in Ciudad Chihuahua decided <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>put.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day, Syrian {{aircraft}} bombed the Israeli village Kinneret {{and the regional}} school Beit Yerah, on the southwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee. By evening, Samakh (Tzemah) had fallen and a new Israeli defensive line {{was set up in}} the Deganias, facing the Syrian counterparts. At night, a Palmach company from Yiftach's 3rd Battalion attempted to recapture Samakh's police station. They stealthily reached the school next to the station, but the assault on the actual fort was warded off. On the morning of May 19, a message was sent from Sha'ar HaGolan and Masada that they were preparing for an evacuation, although when the order was given <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>put,</b> the villages had already been abandoned, mostly to Afikim. In the morning, when the villagers carried out an order to return to their positions, local Arabs were already present at the location. The Syrian troops then captured the villages without a fight, and proceeded to loot and destroy them. Aharon Israeli wrote that an order was given not to disclose the flight of Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan's residents, but this became clear as fire and smoke rose from the villages, and hurt the morale of the Israelis making defensive preparations in the Deganias.|$|E
5|$|Nettlecombe Court {{has several}} emblems and carvings bearing {{the image of}} a horse rising from the sea, which are the Trevilian family arms, found {{throughout}} the house. The source story of the arms is the Lyonesse legend of Trevilian, as follows: Lyonesse were the lands, now submerged, on the west coast that was said to be the lands of Camelot of King Arthur and the site of the final mortal battle between King Arthur and Mordred. Tennyson's Idylls of the King claims Lyonesse as the final resting place of King Arthur himself. Perhaps this is why the grave of the king cannot be found, as it lies beneath the sea. Roman writings also speak of a Leonis, now submerged off the coast. Lyonesse was also the home of Tristan and Isolde. Legend relates that when Lyonesse suddenly sank, it was inundated as sea levels rushed in. The sole surviving knight of King Arthur's Lyonesse was said to be only one knight, Trevilian, who escaped by riding his white horse through the rising waters to higher ground before Lyonesse was submerged. Trevilian urged the other knights to join him in his attempt to escape, who counter-urged Trevilian <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>put</b> and wait for the floodwaters to pass. The sedentary knights jovially bet wagers amongst themselves around the supper table, {{as to whether or not}} Trevilian and his white horse could survive swimming through the incoming flooding and make it to higher ground. None of the other Arthurian knights of Lyonesse, except Trevilian, was said to have survived the great sinking and inundation of Lyonesse. Submerged Medieval church bells of the lost land of Lyonesse were later said to be heard ringing, muffled under the water, when turbulent storms created rough seas. The surviving Trevilian became the founder of the current British Trevilian-Trevelyan family, whose coat of arms still bears a white horse issuing forth from the sea. In some cases the Trevilian white horse arms may be seen combined at Nettlecombe with other related family arms, indicating marriages to Raleigh, Luttrell, Wyndham, Chichester and Strode.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} Israeli {{point of}} view arguing that Arab leaders encouraged Palestinian Arabs to flee has also been disputed by the New Historians, which instead have shown evidence indicating Arab leaders' will for the Palestinian Arab population <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>put.</b> Historians such as Benny Morris, Erskine Childers, and Walid Khalidi state that no evidence of widespread evacuation orders exists, and that Arab leaders in fact instructed the Palestinian Arabs <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>put.</b> According to Morris, whatever the reasons driving many into flight, temporary evacuation under local orders, contagious panic, fear of Jewish arms, or direct expulsion manu militari, the 700,000 odd Palestinians who did become refugees acquired that status {{as a result of}} compulsory displacement or expulsion, since they were not permitted by Israel to return. In any case, even if the 1948 exodus had not been caused by Israel, the claimed right of return is not contingent on Israeli responsibility for the displacement of refugees.|$|E

25|$|Hannibal, {{after his}} plundering mission was completed, {{decided to leave}} the plain, {{choosing}} not to winter there. While Fabius, with secure supply lines, had the luxury to sit and wait until his term as dictator expired or the Carthaginians finally attacked him, Hannibal, having stripped the area bare of all supplies, could not afford <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>put</b> indefinitely and ultimately face a supply shortage. The Romans, guided by Fabius, still refused to attack him despite whatever provocation he came up with. Hannibal, on the other hand, did not wish to suffer severe casualties by a head-on assault on the Romans settled in fortified camps on the high ground. Since both commanders sought to fight on favorable conditions, the stalemate continued. The Carthaginian army finally moved east towards the pass beside Mount Callicula through which they had originally entered the plain. Fabius, anticipating the move, had blocked the pass with 4,000 troops, and encamped on a nearby hill with the main army. Minucius then joined this army with his contingent.|$|E
25|$|In 1867, Griffith Dickenson Compton led a {{group of}} 30 pioneers to the area. These {{families}} had traveled by wagon train south from Stockton, California in search of ways {{to earn a living}} other than in the rapid exhaustion of gold fields. Originally named Gibsonville, after one of the tract owners, it was later called Comptonville. However, to avoid confusion with the Comptonville located in Yuba County, the name was shortened to Compton. Compton's earliest settlers were faced with terrible hardships as they farmed the land in bleak weather to get by with just the barest subsistence. The weather continued to be harsh, rainy and cold, and fuel was difficult to find. To gather firewood it was necessary to travel to mountains close to Pasadena. The round trip took almost a week. Many in the Compton party wanted to relocate to a friendlier climate and settle down, but as there were two general stores within traveling distance—one in the pueblo of Los Angeles, the other in Wilmington—they eventually decided <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>put.</b>|$|E
40|$|In a {{discrete}} setting, a model is developed for pricing a contingent claim in incomplete markets. Since hedging opportunities influence {{the price of}} a contingent claim, the optimal hedging strategy is first introduced assuming that a contingent claim has been issued: a strategy implemented by investing initial wealth plus the selling price is optimal if it maximizes the expected utility of the agent's net payoff, which is the difference between the outcome of the hedging portfolio and the payoff of the claim. The 'reservation price' is then introduced as a subjective valuation of a contingent claim. This is defined as the minimum price that makes the issue of the claim preferable <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> <b>put</b> given that, once the claim has been written, the writer hedges it according to the expected utility criterion. The reservation price is defined both for a short position (reservation selling price) and for a long position (reservation buying price) in the claim. When the contingent claim is redundant, both the selling and the buying price collapse in the usual Arrow-Debreu (or Black-Scholes) price. If the claim is non-redundant, then the reservation prices are interior points of the bid-ask interval. Two numerical examples are provided with different utility functions and contingent claims. Some qualitative properties of the reservation price are shown. Contingent Claims, Incomplete Markets, Reservation Price, Expected Utility, Optimization,...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The paper uses a real options {{valuation}} {{model with}} stochastic freight rates to investigate market efficiency and {{the economics of}} switching between the dry bulk and the tanker markets in international shipping. A dry bulk carrier is replaced with a tanker when the expected net present value of such a switch is optimal from a real options based decision rule. Depending {{on the development of}} the markets a reversal may take place later. The cost and demand parameters upon which the decisions to switch are made, including the stochastic characteristics of freight rates, are estimated from an empirical analysis that is updated every week throughout a 12 -year time period from 1993 to 2005. The second-hand market for bulk ships seems to have been efficient most of these years in the sense that market switching usually did not pay off, with one major exception: it seemed profitable in expectation to leave the dry bulk market and enter the tanker market over a significant period of time shortly after the millennium shift, and to return to dry bulk market about three years later. These points in time corresponded with an unprecedented boom period in the tanker and drybulk freight markets, respectively, and the result suggest that agents in the second-hand market were slow to adjust their expectations. In retrospect, such an investment policy also happened to be profitable compared <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> <b>put</b> in the tanker market, even after accounting for transaction costs...|$|R

500|$|Harvey and Stewart {{said that}} the fatwa was a {{departure}} from the previous legal opinions among Islamic scholars, which typically emphasised the obligation to emigrate from any country where proper religious observance was not possible. Notably, the Maliki scholar al-Wansharisi, the leading living authority on the issue, was among the proponents of this view. Stewart contended that, while the fatwa's text did not mention any opponent, it was intended as a rebuke against the views of al-Wansharisi. Recipients of this fatwa would be able <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>put,</b> outwardly conforming to Christianity and not see themselves as abandoning their faith. The fatwa addressed the recipient as [...] "al-guraba", a word that means [...] "outsiders" [...] or [...] "those living abroad", but this word also appears in several hadiths (sayings of Muhammad) and evokes a spiritual meaning of heroic Muslims loyal to their faith in spite of great suffering. The sympathy shown by the author, as well as his acknowledgement of the Muslims' loyalty and suffering, is in contrast with the predominant opinion such as al-Wansharisi's which saw them unfavourably.|$|E
