40|$|Abstract: Morse code is a simple, speedy and {{low cost}} means of {{communication}} composed {{of a series of}} dots, dashes and space intervals. Each <b>tone</b> <b>element</b> (either a dot, dash or space interval) is transmitted by sending a signal for a dened length of time. This poses a challenge as the automatic recognition of Morse code is dependent upon maintaining a stable typing rate. In this paper, a suitable adaptive automatic recognition method, combining the least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm with a neural network, was applied to this problem. The method presented in this paper is divided into ve modules: space recognition, tone recognition, learning process, adaptive processing and character recognition. Statistical analyses demonstrated that the proposed method elicited a better recognition rate in comparison with other methods in the literature...|$|E

40|$|International audienceUsing {{waveform}} {{data obtained}} {{by one of the}} THEMIS satellites, we report properties of rising <b>tone</b> chorus <b>elements</b> without a gap at half the gyrofrequency in a region close to the magnetic equator. The wave normal angle of the chorus elements is typically field-aligned in the entire frequency range of both upper-band and lower-band chorus emissions. We find that the observed frequency sweep rates are consistent with the estimation based on the nonlinear wave growth theory of Omura et al. (2008). In addition, we compare the frequency profiles of the chorus wave amplitudes with those of the optimum and threshold wave amplitudes derived from the nonlinear wave growth theory for triggering rising tone chorus emissions. The results of the comparison show a reasonable agreement, indicating that rising <b>tone</b> chorus <b>elements</b> are continually generated through a triggering process which generates elements with the optimum amplitudes for nonlinear growth...|$|R

Pattern movement was analysed with a Praat program. Supporting theories of communicative competence were used. Research method used descriptive method with a qualitative approach. The research subjects were Surabaya citizen with a profiency in Chinese language. Analyses results discover that word patterns {{of all types of}} tones (first/second/third/fourth/light tones) did not entirely follow the theoretical pattern and there exsists several deviations. This was due that the theoretical word pattern only consists of two words, while word patterns in this paper were natural discourse sentences and it is also more difficult to change the muscle strain of the vocal chord from relaxed to strained position. While sentence tone patterns in Chinese declarative sentences in the discourse of the Surabaya citizen showed a decending pattern if the sentence only give information. But has a asending pattern in the speaker did not agree to the information delivered. These tone patterns in declarative sentences depends on the context of speech, emotion of the speaker and vocabulary used.

40|$|What is the {{relationship}} between syntax, prosody and phonetics? This paper argues for a declarative constraint-based. theory, in which each step in a derivation adds diverse constraints to a pool. Some of these describe well formed objects in the feature structure domain, in terms of both syntactic and prosodic features. Some characterise the relative prominence of constituents as a partial order over some discrete domain (playing the role of metrical grid). Some are simultaneous equations in the reals, whose solutions represent the pitch level of phonetic objects - high and low <b>tones.</b> The <b>elements</b> of such a theory are illustrated with a treatment of prosodic phrasing and tone scaling in Tokyo Japanese, and the theory is compared to Selkirk and Tateishi's analysis based on the Strict Layer Hypothesis...|$|R

5000|$|Several {{scholarly}} {{studies have}} critiqued this translation. [...] One {{of the criticisms}} of the English translation is how it has been altered from its original form to suit the literary tastes of the targeted country. Some authors argue that when texts are introduced to an international audience they are changed from their original form and morphed to match the culture and agenda of the publishing company more closely. One of these changes that authors have referred to is the modification in <b>tone</b> towards political <b>elements</b> of the text.|$|R

She also has many love and other personal problems - she has just absconded from the psychiatric ward. The problems, however, do not look dramatic in the songs in the form as they were written by Murdoch and are performed by the vocalists. Most of the pieces are cheerful in <b>tone,</b> with <b>elements</b> of irony and self-irony; even the more reflective songs, like Come Monday Night, have a cheerful and catchy tune.
