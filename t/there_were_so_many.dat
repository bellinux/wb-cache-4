5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> {{uncritical}} and unproven speculations about floral {{mechanisms that}} floral ecology became discredited. In the 1920s, it was revived with further developments in detailed analyses of insects' senses, led by researchers Frederic Clements, Karl von Frisch and others. Their experiments resulted in new information, including the discovery that some insects have ultraviolet vision, and findings involving bee learning and communication. Modern floral ecology has been reinvigorated by its relevance for evolutionary studies.|$|E
5|$|There {{were some}} initial {{problems}} with the system. During Operation Commando Hunt I, for example, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> aircraft piling {{up in the air}} space over southern Laos that the air controllers and FACs could not keep track of them. Pilots, many of whom were veterans of Rolling Thunder, tended to arrive over the area in large waves instead of spacing out their arrivals over time. One technical failure, however, would have huge ramifications for the entire program. The anti-personnel system, which was based on the dispersal of wide-area Gravel mines (the explosions of which would activate acoustic sensors) failed completely. The mines deteriorated too rapidly in the heat and humidity of Laos, thereby negating the system.|$|E
5|$|On {{the front}} side, on the Rokin, the rescue {{operations}} of the fire department were also hampered. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> people standing on the window ledges screaming that the fire fighters did not know who to save first. Time was also lost because some people threw their luggage in the life net and then jumped into it themselves, causing injuries. Some people fell {{to the side of}} the net and were severely injured. Just before 7:00am the part of the hotel which faced the Kalverstraat collapsed. The burning debris landed on the fire engine in the Kalverstraat, and the fire fighters barely escaped to safety. The nearby book store was also burned out and fires broke out in several buildings on the other side of the Kalverstraat, which were quickly brought under control.|$|E

5|$|Chopra saw {{the deal}} as an {{opportunity}} to represent South Asians and break Indian stereotypes in Hollywood and the United States in general. In the process, she became the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series. She revealed that when she was in school , she never saw anyone on television who looked like her, and she found it really weird because she thought <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> people of South Asian descent in America and {{in other parts of the}} world. She also revealed that she did not want to be a stereotype of what Indians were usually seen as in global pop culture, saying that Indians never talk like Apu from The Simpsons. After signing the deal and being given all the 26 pilot scripts that ABC was developing for the 2015–2016 television season, Chopra chose Quantico. Having appeared in over fifty films at that time, the series was also Chopra's first ever audition, which she found very new and nerve-wracking at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Support for {{continued}} use of the name {{has come from the}} team's owners and a majority of fans, which include some Native Americans. Supporters say that the name honors the achievements and virtues of Native Americans, and that it is not intended in a negative manner. Some, such as team president Bruce Allen, also point to the use of Redskins by three high school teams, two on reservations, that have a majority of Native American students. Supporters have asserted that a majority of Native Americans are not offended by the name based upon a national poll by Annenberg Public Policy Center in 2004. In a commentary published soon after that poll, 15 Native American scholars collaborated on a critique that stated that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> flaws in the Annenberg study that rather than being a measure of Native American opinion, it was an expression of white privilege and colonialism. Specific criticism of the methodology includes the use of self-reporting to identify Native Americans, which violated the basic principles supporting the validity of public opinion polling. In May 2016, the Washington Post published a poll that duplicated the central question posed in 2004, yielding an identical result.|$|E
5|$|The earguards are in {{the shape}} of silver ears, and the neckguard is {{decorated}} with a scrolling leaf pattern. Six detached cheekpieces were found within the helmet bowl along with the disintegrated remains of a seventh, although only two would have been needed. Hinges were also found, as was the pin of one cheekpiece, which had been bent. It may have been forcibly removed or possibly sustained damage at a later date, perhaps from a plough. It is unclear why <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> cheekpieces accompanying the helmet; it is possible that they may all have been used on the same helmet to customise its appearance on different occasions, or alternatively they may have been intended as spares in the event of damage. The surviving cheekpieces are very elaborate. Five of the cheekpieces show equestrian scenes; one depicts the triumph of a Roman emperor on horseback, holding his arm in the air as he is crowned with a laurel wreath by the goddess Victoria (Victory). A cowering barbarian is depicted below being trampled by the hooves of the emperor's horse. Another less well-preserved cheekpiece depicts a possibly Middle Eastern figure holding a large cornucopia, and a Roman helmet and shield below.|$|E

25|$|In France, the National Assembly made {{radical changes}} in French laws, and on 26 August 1789, {{published}} the Declaration of the Rights of Man, declaring all men free and equal. The French Revolution shaped {{the course of}} the conflict in Saint-Domingue and was at first widely welcomed in the island. Wealthy whites saw it as an opportunity to gain independence from France, which would allow elite plantation-owners {{to take control of the}} island and create trade regulations that would further their own wealth and power. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> twists and turns in the leadership in France, and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> complex events in Saint-Domingue, that various classes and parties changed their alignments many times. However, the Haitian Revolution quickly became a test of the ideology of the French Revolution, as it radicalized the slavery question and forced French leaders to recognize the full meaning of their revolution.|$|E
25|$|Horse burials are {{relatively}} widespread in Iceland; as of 1999, 115 graves were found that contained {{the remains of}} horses. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> graves in which {{the remains of a}} human female was associated with those of a horse, that it was speculated that a horse burial in association with a male warrior did not occur in Iceland.|$|E

Trade with the Baltic also took place such as a timber trade with Norway.|$|E

25|$|For {{nearly two}} centuries a farming community, San Jose {{produced}} {{a significant amount}} of fruits and vegetables until the 1960s, and many past and current names of teams, streets, buildings, and so on reflect its agricultural beginnings. Prunes, grapes, and apricots were some of the major crops. In 1922, the first commercial farming of broccoli in the U.S. was started in San Jose, by brothers Stephano and Andrea D'Arrigo. The Del Monte cannery in Midtown was the largest employer in the city for many years. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> orchards in the Santa Clara Valley, which emitted a delightful smell of ripening fruit, that a common nickname for the Santa Clara Valley was The Valley of Heart's Delight.|$|E
25|$|In Western Han Dynasty, {{elaborate}} and lavish burials were common practice. One reason was {{the notion of}} imperishability of the soul: {{it was believed that}} another world existed for the dead, and they needed food and accommodation just like the living. Therefore, the consecration for the dead should be the same as what was provided for the living, and all the necessities in life should be brought into the grave for use in the afterlife. The other was the emphasis on filial piety during that time. In Han Dynasty, filial piety had become an important approach to become an official, and {{elaborate and}} lavish burials are a significant way to show filial piety to one's deceased parents. These were among the main reasons why <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> precious artifacts in Xin Zhui's tomb.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1907, the Patrick Family (consisting of five children, {{including}} future Hockey Hall of Fame members Frank and Lester Patrick) relocated to Nelson, British Columbia. By 1910, the Patrick family would influence the Nelson Ladies Hockey Club. Myrtle, Cynda and Dora Patrick were all involved with the club. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> members, that the club was split into two teams: the Stirlings and the Wanderers. In 1911, the Nelson Ladies Club was coached by Lester Patrick, and Dora was the captain. Once again, the team would eventually split into two smaller teams: the Cubs and the Athletics. After 1911, the Patrick family left Nelson and moved to Victoria. The Nelson Ladies Club would continue until 1916, but would lose to the Rossland team every year.|$|E
