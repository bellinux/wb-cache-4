5|$|The media tended <b>to</b> <b>overlook</b> <b>the</b> meaning behind Pussy Riot's feminism; the {{cultural}} context {{of it is}} vastly {{different from that of}} Western feminism. According to Elianna Kan in the American Reader, Pussy Riot's feminism focused on the repression of authoritarian regimes that created idealised ideas of sexism, sex and family life. Pussy Riot strove {{to make it clear that}} feminism in Russia was still an issue and that post-feminism had not been achieved.|$|E
5|$|Led by Jim Peplinski, an alumni {{game was}} {{organized}} for Saturday, February 19, at McMahon. The game featured 14 {{members of the}} Flames' 1989 Stanley Cup championship team, including Lanny McDonald, Al MacInnis, Joel Otto, Theoren Fleury and Joe Nieuwendyk. For Nieuwendyk, {{at the time the}} General Manager of the Dallas Stars, the chance to participate in the game was important enough that he chose <b>to</b> <b>overlook</b> <b>the</b> chronic pain in his back when he is on skates. Immensely popular forward Craig Conroy, who retired only {{a few weeks before the}} game, also took part for Calgary.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of the Chinese counteroffensive, the PVA 120th Division first accidentally {{stumbled}} upon the US 9th Infantry Regiment on the northern bank of the Ch'ongch'on River. The surprise encounter between the two sides soon left the 9th Infantry Regiment with only three rifle companies combat effective. Unaware that the 1st Battalion of the US 23rd Infantry Regiment had pulled up behind the US 61st Field Artillery Battalion, four Sharp Sword Companies from the PVA 359th Regiment of the 120th Division proceeded to cross the river and attacked the US artillery positions. Although the 61st Battalion was routed by surprise, the US 23rd Infantry Regiment quickly knocked out two of the unsuspecting Chinese companies. The surviving Chinese troops drifted eastward and occupied a hill named Chinaman's Hat, enabling the Chinese <b>to</b> <b>overlook</b> <b>the</b> entire 23rd Infantry Regiment's positions.|$|E

50|$|Lewis {{is skeptical}} of the death penalty, but not {{necessarily}} the sentencing of inmates to life {{in order to protect}} the public. Neither Lewis nor Pincus believe the death penalty works as a deterrent. Lewis believes that the quest for justice often leads many prosecutors, judges, jurors <b>to</b> <b>overlook</b> things that could be considered mitigating circumstances. She believes that this leads <b>to</b> <b>overlooking</b> <b>the</b> root causes of crime and prevents long term solutions that will help reduce child abuse and prevent more abused children from becoming killers.|$|R

25|$|A new {{characteristic}} of the modern aspects of the third quest has been the role of archaeology; James Charlesworth states that few modern scholars now want <b>to</b> <b>overlook</b> <b>the</b> archaeological discoveries that clarify the nature of life in Galilee and Judea {{during the time of}} Jesus. A further {{characteristic of}} the third quest has been its interdisciplinary and global nature of the scholarship. While the first two quests were mostly carried out by European Protestant theologians, the third quest has seen a worldwide influx of scholars from multiple disciplines.|$|E
25|$|Deregulation is {{generally}} regarded as the catalyst for yield management in the airline industry, but this tends <b>to</b> <b>overlook</b> <b>the</b> role of Global Distribution Systems (GDSs). It is arguable that the fixed pricing paradigm {{occurs as a result}} of decentralized consumption. With mass production, pricing became a centralized management activity and customer contact staff focused on customer service exclusively. Electronic commerce, of which the GDSs were the first wave, created an environment where large volumes of sales could be managed without large numbers of customer service staff. They also gave management staff direct access to price at time of consumption and rich data capture for future decision-making.|$|E

The former stockman's house is located on another knoll to the south with the remains of the former stables, pig pen and other yards contained in the gully between. Remnants of the Aboriginal campsite are located on the flats about 200m south of the former stockman's house.|$|E
25|$|On 4 April 1973, {{the trench}} {{to the new}} slipway was completed, and Batfish was maneuvered into {{position}} by cables attached to four bulldozers, plus a Port of Muskogee tugboat. Over the next week, further flooding of the slip was used to bring the submarine to her final resting elevation, and by 1 May, she had been realigned <b>to</b> <b>overlook</b> <b>the</b> Arkansas River. Batfish was officially opened on the Memorial Day weekend; {{by the end of}} August 1973, the submarine was attracting a thousand visitors a week, with income from paid attendance doubling over the boat's first seven weeks on display. The submarine had been restored well, {{with the exception of the}} conning tower, and she is open to the public year round.|$|E
25|$|Lanci's {{most notable}} {{achievement}} was his invention in 1567 {{of a piece}} of surveying equipment to obtain perspectives with a visual field of 180Â°. The instrument, which he named distanziometro ("distance meter"), was made of a circular bronze plate placed upon a horizontal tripod the height of which could be adjusted. Semi-cylindrical paper was wound around its edge. A cylindrical eyepiece was placed in the centre with a retracting metal needle or pen underneath. The eyepiece was high enough <b>to</b> <b>overlook</b> <b>the</b> semicircle of paper and sight points of interest while the retracting needle scored on the paper to accurately plot the subject. It could also be used as a quadrant for measuring height {{in much the same way}} as the orizzonte designed by Leon Battista Alberti.|$|E

25|$|The battlefront {{turned toward}} Richmond in the Peninsula Campaign. The heavy {{forestation}} inhibited {{the use of}} balloons, so Lowe and his Balloon Corps, {{with the use of}} three of his balloons, the Constitution, the Washington, and the larger Intrepid, used the waterways to make its way inland. In mid May 1862, Lowe arrived at the White House on the Pamunkey River. This is the first home of George and Martha Washington, after which the Washington presidential residence is named. At this time, it was the home of the son of Robert E. Lee, whose family fled at the arrival of Lowe. Lowe was met by McClellan's Army a few days later, and by 18 May, he had set up a balloon camp at Gaines' Farm across the Chickahominy River north of Richmond, and another at Mechanicsville. From these vantage points, Lowe, his assistant James Allen, and his father Clovis were able <b>to</b> <b>overlook</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Seven Pines.|$|E
25|$|Of all {{the city}} gates and triumphal arches built during the Neoclassical period, {{the most famous}} and monumental is {{certainly}} the Arco della Pace. It was built during the Kingdom of Italy period {{at the end of}} the Corso Sempione road, the principal axis connecting the city to France under whose dependency the Kingdom came. Designed by Luigi Cagnola, construction began in 1805 only to be suspended a few years later. It was completed in 1816 at the instigation of Francis I of Austria. He called it the arch for European peace which had been achieved the previous year at the Congress of Vienna. The arch consists of three fornices with four giant order Corinthian columns. The entablature depicts allegories of the main rivers of the region, the Po, Ticino, Adige and Tagliamento, sculpted by Pompeo Marchesi. On top is a group of bronze sculptures from designs by Luigi Cagnola. The Chariot of Peace (Sestiga della Pace), representing Napoleon's victories, was originally designed to face the Corso Sempione but was later repositioned <b>to</b> <b>overlook</b> <b>the</b> city. Similarly, the arch's bas-reliefs were intended to depict Napoleon's exploits but when work began, under the influence of the Austrians, some of the scenes were changed to represent episodes from the Restoration and the Congress of Vienna while others depicting Napoleon were replaced with heads resembling Francis I. The customs offices on either side of the Arco della Pace date from 1838.|$|E

When {{the rapid growth of}} the city and the further expansion of the fortifications (up to the KÃ¤figturm) relegated the tower to second-line status at around 1270â75, it was heightened by [...] <b>to</b> <b>overlook</b> <b>the</b> surrounding houses.|$|E

500|$|The port's {{enhanced}} visuals were commended by many reviewers. GameZone's Hopper {{considered the}} visuals {{an improvement over}} the original versions. Andy Robinson of Computer and Video Games called the visuals [...] "impressive", while Tom Orry of VideoGamer.com called them [...] "superb". Conversely, the port's system requirements, considered difficult to run with advanced settings, received criticism. Eurogamer's Gillen said that, though the Windows version is [...] "the most attractive version", it's [...] "annoyingly fiddly to get there". GameSpy's Tuttle was able <b>to</b> <b>overlook</b> <b>the</b> demanding system requirements {{in exchange for the}} game's other features.|$|E

When asked what {{his reaction to}} Landy's death had been, Wilson responded: [...] "I was devastated."

[...] She, however, clarified that she wasn't involved in the production aspect of the company, but participated in supervising and [...] "overseeing everything".
