25|$|There is an unsolved {{issue about}} his final rank. Sources like the {{promotion}} recommendations from Generals Hardee and Johnston speak for a promotion from Major to Lieutenant Colonel in early 1864. There are several authors who {{speak of a}} promotion either from Major to Colonel or from Lieutenant Colonel to Colonel - what gives <b>those</b> <b>voices</b> credibility {{is the most common}} date when the promotion was dated, February 20, 1864. His microfilmed muster roll also lists his highest rank as Colonel. In the Official Records on most occasions everyone (Lt. Col. or Col.) is simply addressed as Col., including Smith in the later war years. However, there is a single document in which Smith and other artillery officers are strictly differed into Lieutenant Colonels and Colonels. This document refers to Smith as (full) Colonel. It is authorized by Major General Arnold Elzey, commanding the artillery of the Army of Tennessee; and written by Captain Charles Swett, Elzey's Inspector General, on December 21, 1864.|$|E

500|$|Echevarria {{suggested}} this to Behr over lunch, but {{he initially}} was not sure. By {{the time they}} had returned separately to the studio, Behr had an entire plan worked out based on the new premise for the character. Behr suggested that the character should be basically acting as if she's schizophrenic, saying [...] "We'd never played up the idea in the past, but it made sense. What must it be like to hear all <b>those</b> <b>voices</b> and opinions?" [...] The producers also decided that they wanted a younger actress who felt vulnerable in order to offset the strength that Jadzia had grown into over the years. Casting remained difficult, until Hans Beimler suggested an actress from Canada whom he had once worked with – Nicole de Boer. She had worked with Beimler on the television series Beyond Reality and TekWar. She was asked to submit an audition tape where she played out a scene between Ezri and Quark, which she recorded herself in the hotel room she was staying at, and later admitted that she did not know what a Trill was at the time.|$|E

500|$|According to the musicologist Walter Everett, Sgt. Pepper {{marks the}} {{beginning}} of McCartney's ascendancy as the Beatles' dominant creative force. He wrote {{more than half of the}} album's material while asserting increasing control over the recording of his compositions. He would from this point on provide the artistic direction for the group's releases. Sessions began on 24 November 1966 in Abbey Road Studio Two, the first time that the Beatles had come together since September. Afforded the luxury of a nearly limitless recording budget, they booked open-ended sessions that allowed them to work as late as they wanted. They began with three songs that were thematically linked to their childhoods: [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever", [...] "When I'm Sixty-Four" [...] and [...] "Penny Lane". The first session saw the introduction of a new keyboard instrument called the Mellotron, the keys of which triggered tape-recordings of a variety of instruments, enabling its user to play keyboard parts using <b>those</b> <b>voices.</b> McCartney performed the introduction to [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever" [...] using the flute setting. The track's complicated production involved the innovative splicing of two takes that were recorded in different tempos and pitches. Emerick remembers that during the recording of Revolver, [...] "we had got used to being asked to do the impossible, and we knew that the word 'no' didn't exist in the Beatles' vocabulary." [...] In Martin's opinion, Sgt. Pepper [...] "grew naturally out of Revolver", marking [...] "an era of almost continuous technological experimentation".|$|E

In this book, she argues that <b>those</b> <b>voices</b> have been marginalized, and states: [...] "To be in the margin is {{to be part of}} the whole but outside the main body." [...] hooks argued that if feminism seeks to make women equal to men, then it is impossible because in Western society, not all men are equal. She claimed, [...] "Women in lower class and poor groups, particularly those who are non-white, would not have defined women's liberation as women gaining social equality with men since they are continually reminded in their everyday lives that all women do not share a common social status." ...|$|E

50|$|Background speculations {{of overall}} {{causality}} vary {{about the political}} protests centering on the year 1968. Some argue that protests {{could be attributed to}} the social changes during the twenty years following the end of World War II. Many protests were a direct response to perceived injustices, such as <b>those</b> <b>voiced</b> in opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War.|$|R
30|$|In most instances, {{especially}} to <b>those</b> <b>voiced</b> frames, {{the energy of}} speech sparser than noise, namely the absolute of DFT coefficients of noise (except periodic noise) (This paper takes no account of periodic noise.), is more balanced {{than that of the}} speech because <b>those</b> <b>voiced</b> frames are quasi-periodic in time domain and robust in noisy environments [21]. Therefore, according to the characteristics of entropy, the energy of the R continuous frames in each frequency point also follows: when speech appears in some of the R continuous frames, the entropy always becomes smaller than that in the case where all of the R continuous frames are noise frame. Therefore, it is reasonable to track the speech via the change of entropy. So in this paper, a modified DD approach based on the change of entropy (DDBSE) is proposed for a priori SNR estimation. Moreover, considering the importance of noise estimation for speech enhancement, a noise estimation approach based on unbiased MMSE and VAD (UMVAD) is presented.|$|R
