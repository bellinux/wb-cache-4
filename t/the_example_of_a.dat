5|$|Frame Analysis: An Essay on the Organization of Experience (1974) is Goffman's {{attempt to}} explain how {{conceptual}} frames – ways to organize experience – structure an individual's perception of society. This book is thus about the organization of experience rather than the organization of society. A frame {{is a set of}} concepts and theoretical perspectives that organize experiences and guide the actions of individuals, groups and societies. Frame analysis, then, is the study of the organization of social experience. To illustrate the concept of the frame, Goffman gives <b>the</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> picture frame: a person uses the frame (which represents structure) to hold together his picture (which represents the content) of what he is experiencing in his life.|$|E
5|$|In 1903–04 Vaughan Williams started {{collecting}} folk-songs. He {{had always}} been interested in them, and now followed <b>the</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> recent generation of enthusiasts such as Cecil Sharp and Lucy Broadwood in going into the English countryside noting down and transcribing songs traditionally sung in various locations. Collections of the songs were published, preserving many that could otherwise have vanished as oral traditions died out. Vaughan Williams incorporated some into his own compositions, and more generally was influenced by their prevailing modal forms. This, together with his love of Tudor and Stuart music, helped shape his compositional style {{for the rest of his}} career.|$|E
5|$|John Koller {{explains}} {{the role of}} intent in Jainism with <b>the</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> monk, who unknowingly offered poisoned food to his brethren. According to the Jain view, the monk is guilty of a violent act if the other monks die because they eat the poisoned food; {{but according to the}} Buddhist view he would not be guilty. The crucial difference between the two views is that the Buddhist view excuses the act, categorising it as non-intentional, since he was not aware that the food was poisoned; whereas the Jain view holds the monk to have been responsible, due to his ignorance and carelessness. Jains argue that the monk's very ignorance and carelessness constitute an intent to do violence and hence entail his guilt. So the absence of intent does not absolve a person from the karmic consequences of guilt either, according to the Jain analysis.|$|E

5|$|Philosopher Paul Tillich {{argued that}} {{religious}} faith is best expressed through symbolism because a symbol {{points to a}} meaning beyond itself and best expresses transcendent religious beliefs. He believed that any statement about God is symbolic and participates in {{the meaning of a}} concept. Tillich used <b>the</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> national flag to illustrate his point: a flag points to something beyond itself, the country it represents, but also participates in the meaning of the country. He believed that symbols could unite a religious believer with a deeper dimension of himself as well as with a greater reality. Tillich believed that symbols must emerge from an individual collective unconsciousness, and can only function when they are accepted by the unconscious. He believed that symbols cannot be invented, but live and die at the appropriate times.|$|E

25|$|If one {{reference}} frame is assigned {{precisely the same}} time to two events that are at different points in space, a {{reference frame}} that is moving relative to the first will generally assign different times to the two events.

She both believes and disbelieves her husband is dead: it just happens that one of her two beliefs is justified, true and satisfies some knowledge conditions.|$|E

25|$|The key {{sources to}} uncover the history of Mataram Sultanate are local Javanese {{historical}} accounts called Babad, and Dutch accounts of Dutch East India Company (VOC).

25|$|Web {{designer}} Doug Bowman {{has said}} that the original Internet Explorer box model represents a better, more logical approach. Peter-Paul Koch gives <b>the</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> physical box, whose dimensions always refer to the box itself, including potential padding, but never its content. He says that this box model is more useful for graphic designers, who create designs based on the visible width of boxes rather than the width of their content. Bernie Zimmermann says that the Internet Explorer box model is closer to the definition of cell dimensions and padding used in the HTML table model.|$|E
25|$|Simply put, {{the test}} is that one must universalize the maxim (imagine that all people acted in this way) and then see if {{it would still be}} {{possible}} to perform the maxim in the world without contradiction. In Groundwork, Kant gives <b>the</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> person who seeks to borrow money without intending to pay it back. This is a contradiction because if it were a universal action, no person would lend money anymore as he knows that he will never be paid back. The maxim of this action, says Kant, results in a contradiction in conceivability (and thus contradicts perfect duty).|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the effect of}} network {{structure}} between agents and objects on measures for systemic risk. We model the influence of sharing large exogeneous losses to the financial or (re) insuance market by a bipartite graph. Using Pareto-tailed losses and multivariate regular variation we obtain asymptotic results for systemic conditional risk measures based on the Value-at-Risk and the Conditional Tail Expectation. These results allow us to assess the influence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> individual institution on the systemic or market risk and vice versa through <b>a</b> collection <b>of</b> conditional systemic risk measures. For large markets Poisson approximations of the relevant constants are provided in <b>the</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> insurance market. <b>The</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> underlying homogeneous random graph is analysed in detail, {{and the results are}} illustrated through simulations...|$|R
25|$|As Paul Erdős observed, the Sylvester–Gallai theorem {{immediately}} {{implies that}} any set of n points {{that are not}} collinear determines at least n different lines. As a base case, the result is clearly true for n=3. For any larger value of n, {{the result can be}} reduced from n points to n1 points, by deleting an ordinary line and one of the two points on it. Thus, it follows by mathematical induction. <b>The</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> near-pencil (a set of n1 collinear points together with one additional point that is not on the same line as the other points) shows that this bound is tight.|$|E
25|$|Structuration is {{very useful}} in synthesising micro and macro issues. On a micro scale, one of individuals' {{internal}} {{sense of self}} and identity, consider <b>the</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> family: we are increasingly free to choose our own mates and how to relate with them, which creates new opportunities but also more work, as the relationship becomes a reflexive project that has to be interpreted and maintained. Yet this micro-level change cannot be explained only by looking at the individual level as people did not spontaneously change their minds about how to live; neither can we assume they were directed to do so by social institutions and the state.|$|E
25|$|The {{intuitive}} {{concept of}} dimension of a geometric object X {{is the number}} of independent parameters one needs to pick out a unique point inside. However, any point specified by two parameters can be instead specified by one, because the cardinality of the real plane is equal to the cardinality of the real line (this can be seen by an argument involving interweaving the digits of two numbers to yield a single number encoding the same information). <b>The</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> space-filling curve shows that one can even take one real number into two both surjectively (so all pairs of numbers are covered) and continuously, so that a one-dimensional object completely fills up a higher-dimensional object.|$|E
