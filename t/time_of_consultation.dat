40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{influence}} of age, gender {{and the nature of}} the patient's problems on length of <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> in the practices of newly trained family doctors in a recently reconstructed health care system. Design: Video-recordings of consultations with consecutive patients in family practice were studied for duration of consultation in relation to age, gender and nature of the problem(s). Setting: Primary health care. Subjects: 405 consecutive consultations were video-taped in the practices of 27 family doctors. Main outcome measures: Length of <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> and its segments was analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. The problems were classified according to the ICPC. Results: The average consultation lasted 9. 0 min (+ - 4. 9).

More than one reason for the encounter was given in onefourth of cases. Consultation time was longer for older age groups and for patients with psychological problems. Conclusion: Video-recording allows consultations to be evaluated directly and is acceptabel to patients. The high participation rate of patients in our study can be explained by the individual approach and by the family doctor system.

40|$|Background and objectives: Serum {{creatinine}} concentration at {{the time}} of nephrology consultation is not necessarily indicative of the severity of acute kidney injury (AKI). Although urine microscopy is useful to differentiate AKI, its role in predicting adverse clinical outcomes has not been well described. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: The relationship between urine microscopy findings {{at the time}} of nephrol-ogy consultation for AKI and clinical outcomes was evaluated prospectively. A urinary sediment scoring system was created {{on the basis of the}} number of renal tubular epithelial cells and granular casts. The primary outcome was worsening of AKI (progressing to higher AKI Network stage, dialysis, or death) during hospitalization. Results: Of 249 patients consulted for AKI, 197 had acute tubular necrosis or prerenal AKI and were included in the analysis. At consultation, 80 (40 %) had stage 1, 53 (27 %) had stage 2, and 66 (33 %) had stage 3 AKI. The urinary sediment combined scores were lowest in those with stage 1 and highest in stage 3 AKI.

The survey was carried out using questionnaires of the self-administration type. Women with fertility problems did in fact consistently report a higher prevalence of negative emotions than the controls with reference to the periods during which they had been trying to conceive.

A qualitative study of their views was therefore designed, which incorporated an in-depth (open) interview technique carried out on a 20 % sample of all GPs (n = 100) in one United Kingdom Health District. The data from these interviews indicated that GPs were aware of, but had mixed feelings about the need for rationing. They expressed disquiet about the dilemma faced in rationing health care at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the <b>consultation</b> and readily associated issues of cost in their practice with rationing. Some of the currently adopted methods of rationing (waiting lists, co-payments and ability to pay) were commented upon. The respondents also made suggestions on how rationing could be carried out, which included: maximizing efficiency to reduce the need for rationing; using a third party committee to make rationing decisions, with a membership of clinicians, managers, and possibly public representatives, and; being explicit about how rationing is done. Fundholding brought rationing decisions to the fore, and worried most who discussed {{it in the context of}} rationing.
