40|$|Optical {{remote sensing}} plays a {{fundament}} role {{in attempts to}} map repeatedly, in various spatial resolutions, and in a cost efficient way, {{the status of the}} Earth system. For the retrieval of vegetation biophysical variables such as leaf area index, physically based radiative transfer models (RTM) have been developed. The RTMs link the variables of interest with the measured spectral and/or directional signature of the canopy. To map the biophysical variables, the RTMs have to be inverted. For the inversion, different strategies have been developed (e. g., look-up-table, neural nets), each having specific advantages and disadvantages. Common to all inversion strategies, however, is the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, meaning that the inverse solution is not always unique leading to large uncertainties in the estimated fields. The uncertainties arise from several facts: (i) the dimensionality of the observed spectral/directional variables is generally lower than the number of unknowns within the RTM, (ii) several variables within the RTM can counterbalance each other, and (iii) both, spectral measurements and RTMs are not free of error. To cope with the ill-posed inverse problem, various strategies have been proposed {{such as the use of}} prior info within the cost function and the use of information provided by the continuous temporal evolution of key vegetation structural variables.

The idea builds on the geographical principle that near-by locations are probably more alike than locations at a larger distance.

The proposed object-based inversion allows to effectively constrain the inverse problem. The pros and cons of the developed approach will be presented and discussed with respect to alternative solutions. Implementation issues will be described. Using mainly synthetic data, retrieval accuracies of main biophysical variables will be compared to those obtained without regularisation. JRC. G. 3 -Monitoring agricultural resource...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} query {{evaluation}} on Active XML documents (AXML for short), {{a new generation}} of XML documents that has recently gained popularity. AXML documents are XML documents whose content is given partly extensionally, by explicit data elements, and partly intensionally, by embedded calls to Web services, which can be invoked to generate data. A major challenge in the efficient evaluation of queries over such documents is to detect which calls may bring data that is relevant for the query execution, and to avoid the materialization of irrelevant information. The problem is intricate, as service calls may be embedded anywhere in the document, and service invocations possibly return data containing calls to new services. Hence, the detection of relevant calls becomes a continuous process. Also, a good analysis must <b>take</b> <b>the</b> service <b>signatures</b> into consideration. We formalize the problem, and provide algorithms to solve it. We also present an implementation that is compliant withXMLandWebservicesstandards,andisusedaspartof the ActiveXML system.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We report spectroelectrochemical and {{transient}} absorption spectroscopic {{studies of}} electron injection {{from the plant}} pigment betanin (Bt) to nanocrystalline TiO 2. Spectroelectrochemical experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to interpret transient absorption data in terms of excited state absorption of Bt and ground state absorption of oxidation intermediates and products. Comparison of the amplitudes of transient signals of Bt on TiO 2 and on ZrO 2, for which no electron injection <b>takes</b> place, reveals <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> of two-electron injection from electronically excited Bt to TiO 2. Transient signals observed for Bt on TiO 2 (in contrast to ZrO 2) on the nanosecond time scale reveal <b>the</b> spectral <b>signatures</b> of photo-oxidation products of Bt absorbing in the red and the blue. These are assigned to a one-electron oxidation product formed by recombination of injected electrons with the two-electron oxidation product. We conclude that whereas electron injection is a simultaneous two-electron process, recombination is a one-electron process. The formation of a semiquinone radical through recombination limits the efficiency and long-term stability of the Bt-based dye-sensitized solar cell...|$|R
40|$|This Letter is to {{investigate}} the physics of a newly discovered phenomenon — contracting flare loops in the early phase of solar flares. In classical flare models, which were constructed based on the phenomenon of expansion of flare loops, an energy releasing site is put above flare loops. These models can predict {{that there is a}} vertical temperature gradient in the top of flare loops due to heat conduction and cooling effects. Therefore, the centroid of an X-ray looptop source at higher energy bands will be higher in altitude, for which we can define as normal temperature distribution. With observations made by RHESSI, we analyzed 10 M- or X-class flares (9 limb flares). For all these flares, the movement of looptop sources shows an obvious U-shaped trajectory, which we <b>take</b> as <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> of contraction-to-expansion of flare loops. We find that, for all these flares, normal temperature distribution does exist, but only along the path of expansion. The temperature distribution along the path of contraction is abnormal, showing no spatial order at all. The result suggests that magnetic reconnection processes in the contraction and expansion phases of these solar flares are different.

Moreover efforts are underway to control the degree and quality of spin-orbit coupling in materials with a concomitant control of transport properties. We calculate the frequency dependent optical conductivity in systems with both Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. We find that when the linear Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling is tuned to be equal to the Rashba spin-orbit coupling, the interband optical conductivity disappears. This is <b>taken</b> to be <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> of <b>the</b> recovery of SU(2) symmetry. The presence of the cubic Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling modifies the dispersion relation of the charge carriers and the velocity operator.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{identifies}} constructions {{needed for}} modeling product structure, shows which ones {{can be represented}} in OWL 2 and suggests extensions for {{those that do not}} have OWL 2 representations. A simplified mobile robot specification is formalized as a Knowledge Base (KB) in an extended logic. A KB is constructed from a signature of types (classes), typed properties, and typed variables and operators. Modeling product structure requires part decompositions, connections between parts, data valued properties, typed operations with variables, and constraints between property values. Data valued properties represent observable properties assumed or measured regarding a product. Operations with variables are used to define constraint properties such as fact that the total product weight is the some of weights of product components. Constructors, which <b>take</b> arguments from <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> and have properties as values, are used to specify families of properties such as part properties. These constructions are illustrated for the mobile robot. Operators and variables are represented as type, property, and operations within type theory...|$|R

This database includes the writing movements of 10 writers producing their genuine signature and of 140 writers forging these sample <b>signatures.</b> Using <b>the</b> 150 genuine <b>signatures</b> without constrictions of the Kent’s database an evaluation of the complexity formula suggested in Found et al <b>took</b> place divided <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> in three categories low, medium and high graphical complexity. The results of the formula implementation were compared with the opinions of three leading professional forensic document examiners employed by Key Forensics in the UK. The analysis of data for Study I reveals that there is not ample evidence that high quality forgeries are possible after training. In addition, a closer view of the kinematics of the forging writers is responsible for our main conclusion, that forged signatures are widely different from genuine especially in the kinematic domain. From all the parameters used in this study 11 out of 15 experienced significant changes when the comparison of the two groups (genuine versus forged signature) took place and gave a clear picture of which parameters can assist forensic document examiners and can be used by them to examine <b>the</b> <b>signatures</b> forgeries. <b>The</b> movements of the majority of forgers are signiﬁcantly slower than those of authentic writers.
