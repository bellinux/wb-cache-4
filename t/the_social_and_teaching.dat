40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2012. Major: Educational Psychology. Advisors: Joan Garfield, Michelle Everson. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiii, 237 pages, appendices A-C. The {{purpose of this}} study was to explore how collaborative tests could be implemented successfully in online introductory statistics courses. The research questions set forth were (1) What is the impact of using collaborative tests in an online statistics course on students´ learning? (2) What is the effect of using collaborative tests on students’ attitudes towards statistics? and (3) How does using a required consensus on collaborative tests vs. a nonconsensus approach affect group discussions? Three collaborative tests were implemented in two online sections of the EPSY- 3264 Basic and Applied Statistics course offered at the University of Minnesota. The two sections were identical in terms of the instructor, assignments, assessments, and lecture notes used. The only difference between the two sections was in terms of the format of the collaborative tests that were used. In the consensus section, students worked together in groups and submitted one answer per group. In the nonconsensus section, students worked on the test together in groups but submitted tests individually. Students were randomly assigned to a consensus (n= 32) or a nonconsensus (n= 27) section of the course. The Comprehensive Assessment of Important Outcomes in Statistics (CAOS) test was used to measure students´ learning, both at the beginning and at the end of the course. The Survey Of Attitudes Toward Statistics (SATS- 36) instrument was used to measure students’ change in attitudes towards statistics. Another instrument designed by the instructor to measure students’ perspective towards collaborative testing was also used. Students’ discussions during the three collaborative tests were reviewed using the Pozzi, Manca, Persico, & Sarti, (2007) framework to evaluate and monitor computersupported collaborative learning. Discussions were coded using three dimensions, iv (Social, Teaching and Cognitive) and their indicators from the framework and then converted to quantitative variables that were used in the data analysis. No significant relationship was found between different sections and students’ scores on the CAOS. There was no significant difference in students’ attitudes towards statistics between the two sections. However, for both sections, students’ attitudes increased in terms of their intellectual knowledge, skills, and interest towards statistics after taking the three collaborative tests. The effects of using a required consensus on collaborative tests vs. a nonconsensus approach on group discussions did not seem to be significantly different. The two formats of the collaborative tests that were used seemed to support students’ discussion more in terms of the Cognitive dimension compared to <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>and</b> <b>Teaching</b> dimensions. Overall, the results suggest that the difference between using two different formats of collaborative tests is not significant. However, the results support what research on collaborative tests in face-to-face courses have demonstrated before such as an increase in students’ attitudes towards learning (e. g., Giraud & Enders, 2000; Ioannou & Artion, 2010). Instructors and researchers should continue to use and experiment with collaborative tests in online introductory statistics courses. The study here is just the beginning in terms of conducting empirical research into what teaching methods and assessments should be used in an effort to create quality and effective online statistics courses...|$|E

This paper explores student-student online coaching from the coach perspective. The empirical case is the project Math Coach, where K- 12 students are coached by teacher students using instant messaging. This research is an adaptation of the community of inquiry model to an online coaching setting, which we refer to as a relationship of inquiry. The adapted model was used to gain a better understanding of the practice of online coaching by exploring the extent to which cognitive, <b>social,</b> <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> presence exist in this case of online coaching. A relationship of inquiry survey was distributed to and answered by all active coaches (n= 41). <b>The</b> adapted cognitive, <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> presence measures achieved an acceptable level of reliability. Differences between three presences, and their respective sub-categories, demonstrate a unique pattern of interaction between coaches and coachees in the online coaching environment.

40|$|The {{research}} is {{an inquiry into}} students’ learning experiences within a blended learning Accounting course in a sub-degree programme at a university in Hong Kong. In this course, the students were required to attend face-to-face classes {{and to participate in}} learning activities in the online platform. A case study research approach was adopted that involved 2 classes of 2 teachers and 80 students. Qualitative data were generated through classroom observations, online participation observations, student learning logs and reflections, student focus group interviews, student individual interviews, individual teacher interviews and an individual interview with the course leader. Thematic data analysis was used and a Community of Inquiry (CoI) model was used as a theoretical framework. The analysis showed that the students engaged in learning by integrating traditional and online learning activities and many of these were located within <b>the</b> <b>social,</b> cognitive <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> presences within the CoI model. However, the students were found to be involved actively in non-prescribed activities that included <b>the</b> use of <b>social</b> network applications. <b>The</b> active learning exploration driven by students’ intrinsic motivation and the consequent collaborative learning among students using social media tools were not reflected in the CoI model. Hence, a new element of autonomy is proposed as an addition to the framework, to reveal the link of autonomous learning to the learning community.

This study analyzes the relationship between girls’ gender role attitudes in adolescence and their likelihood of working in a STEM occupation between the ages of 25 and 30 years old. My paper focuses on how conservative gender role attitudes, with men thought of as the breadwinners and women as the homemakers, may negatively affect a woman’s likelihood of holding a STEM career. I use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY 79) to analyze both a strict definition of STEM as well as a broader one that includes related professions in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> sciences <b>and</b> <b>teaching.</b> Via a regression approach, I hold constant other adolescent attributes to find a direct, negative relationship between adolescent girls with conservative gender role attitudes and future STEM careers. I find that for strict STEM careers, women are. 46 percentage points less likely than men to work in STEM between the ages of 25 and 30 years old with statistical significance at the 1 % level. Creating an interaction variable for conservative gender role attitudes and female, I distinguish by gender to find an additional improbability of holding a STEM job for conservative women. Conservative women are. 32 percentage points less likely work in a STEM job between the ages of 25 and 30 years old with statistical significance at the 5 % level.

40|$|Whereas a {{reasonable}} {{body of research}} now exists {{on the use of}} networked learning and learning communities in higher education, especially in post-graduate studies, less is known about their use in other sectors of education, such as continuous vocational education and training. This research focuses on an example of the use of online learning communities for teachers' professional development – eTwinning Learning Events. It looks at how the online community supports the development of teachers’ competence and practice in online collaboration, how social aspects contribute to this discourse and the impact of facilitation, guidance and orchestration. Action research was used to follow and influence the development of a Learning Event (LE) entitled 'Exploiting Web 2. 0 : eTwinning and Collaboration' first held in April 2010. Applying the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework (Garrison, Anderson, & Archer, 2000) we examined the interrelated dimensions of cognitive presence, <b>social</b> presence <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> presence. <b>The</b> analysis suggested that skills were developed {{in the use of the}} web 2. 0 tools, however there was less impact on <b>teaching</b> competence <b>and</b> practice, <b>social</b> interaction was important but seen as second place to the cognitive activities and the burgeoning community failed to fully develop. The event was rerun in the autumn and an analysis of the data collected through a participant questionnaire, interviews and the coding of the messages in the discussion forums suggested that the changes applied had had a positive impact on <b>the</b> learning, <b>the</b> <b>social</b> interaction <b>and</b> <b>the</b> contribution of the tutors. Cognitive presence had been reinforced through practical experience and a final reflection activity, with evidence of critical thinking emerging in the participants' discourse. A Staff room for informal knowledge sharing had engendered a good <b>social</b> presence <b>and</b> a community had emerged that thrived for as long as it served the purpose of learning. The teaching presence had been ensured through additional tutoring at key points, to provide feedback and encourage reflection, and the gradual emergence of mutual support from peers.

30|$|In {{this study}} we report on {{designing}} <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> a third-year course with 30 students enrolled in education for Enterprise in the Economics faculty at a large contact university in South Africa. The initiative focused on preparing students for working in entrepreneurial concerns. The FC approach, including bespoke content videos for independent study, prepared students for in-class seminars that followed a Harvard-style case-study method, using formative and continuing assessment as evidence of learning. The study uses a pragmatic approach to investigate student perspective about learning in a flipped classroom. We used mixed methods, based on trace data of student engagement in the Bb Learn course management systems (CMS), accompanied by student-reported data from separate sets of closed and open-ended questions for the two main components of the FC – the latter analysed qualitatively. The Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework for BL and its revisions informed interpretation of the resultant themes. Primarily the findings showed that the videos contributed to the mastery of the theory, representing a strong Teaching Presence in the online components. Online technology in the individual space was inspiring and fostered independent, self-directed learning, corresponding with both the Emotional (Cleveland-Innes & Campbell, 2012) and Learning Presences (Shea & Bidjerano, 2012). While the seminars improved understanding of the theory, their main value lay in understanding how to apply the principles in real business cases. <b>The</b> seminars displayed <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> presence, with evidence of all phases of the practical inquiry model on which cognitive presence is based. The methodological contribution is {{that the combination of}} learner trace data and qualitative information provide insight into how students engage in flipped classrooms.|$|R
40|$|Abstract AIMS to {{investigate}} how the professional socialization happens through teacher education. METHODS a qualitative research, descriptive, was developed using exploratory interview and narrative interview to clarify and deepen the collected information. Two Physical Education teachers with different stories {{of personal and}} professional development participated in this study. Through content analysis the data was organized in themes: the cultural capital and the learning of teaching, as a <b>social,</b> spatial <b>and</b> temporal process; a cognitive, plural and heterogenic process and a human, moral and relational process. RESULTS life settings {{can be viewed as}} the building scaffoldings of a professional socialization with the aim of understanding teachers and their practices in the knowledge of their lives, as influenced by social interactions. In this process of successive socializations, teachers build their professional identity, valuing <b>social</b> interactions in <b>the</b> environments they inhabit. In this study, practice was viewed as a site for training, the production of knowledge, and professional socialization in the acquisition of cultural capital. The knowledge of teachers was conceived as having a social nature, bringing underlying sources of acquisition associated with the family, school, and university because they decisively contribute to the structure of the educational practice. CONCLUSION the professional socialization is a dynamic process which involves not only the learning, but the acquisition of a professional ethos and, mainly, a teacher's identity and a base of knowledge that support <b>the</b> <b>social</b> interaction <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>teaching</b> culture in the activities and individual socialization in the habitus perspective...|$|R

40|$|A Teacher Education (TE) on line {{laboratory}} {{offered an}} asyncrounous environment for “reflective experience” to students, in {{a framework of}} blended education. This has been the context for a research project based on four topics. •	Professional Identity that receives increasing attention {{in the field of}} TE (Korthagen 2004; Berry et al. 2007); •	Collaboration as a key aspect for teacher's culture (Woods et al., 1997). •	Case based pedagogy that is one way of effectively integrating learning with practice (Ben Peretz & Kupferberg, 2007) and providing student teachers with opportunities to develop “professional” ways of acting (Harrington et al., 1996). •	On line, asinchronous, text-based environments that foster communities of inquiry' buildings (Garrison, Anderson, 2003). The research has two aims: 	to explore different constructions of professional profiles in pre-service and in-service teacher-students, pre-post case-work activities; 	to analyse the nature of web forum interactions among future teachers and in-service teachers <b>and</b> specifically <b>social</b> cognitive processes. <b>The</b> subjects are: 18 subjects in-service teachers, 29 traditional students. They worked on line for three months. The activities were: 1. 	the students wrote individually a profile {{of what it means to}} be a “good teacher”, before and at the end of the case-work; 2. 	remembering their scholastic experiences, the subjects shared and built one problematic real life case; 3. 	they discussed and justified different solutions and wrote a syntesis of these. Data analysis was conducted in three moments: 	We applied the Specificity Analysis and the Correspondence Analysis to the pre-post profiles, through a software of text analysis. 	Using Garrison and Anderson’s content categories two researchers coded <b>the</b> <b>social,</b> cognitive <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> discussion segments. They established an interrater reliability of 84 %. We calculated density figures for each forum. 	Using the Harrington's coding system (1996), we identified the specific aspect of critical reflection of teachers in the written syntesis of cases. Pre-post text analyses have shown that at the end of the activities the students elaborated a more articulate profile than at the beginning. The content analysis of on-line discussions have shown: •a dialogical co-constructive model of discussing in teacher-students vs a “strategic individualism” in in-service teachers; •an extremely embedded professional identity in teacher-students; •the emergence of a professional identity in pre-service students correlated with flexible, personal <b>and</b> <b>social</b> identities. <b>The</b> analysis of case works demonstrate that the students and the teachers solve their cases through different perspectives. The students’writings are student-centred but with references to authoritative and theoretical sources. The teachers’ perspective is more holistic, but the in-service teachers' analysis, and the solutions, are strictly based on experience and practical knowledge with no attempt to link the issue to the theoretical concepts...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide a bridging solution to adjustment problems of students migrating from secondary school system into college/university environment. It proposes an extended E-Learning through the use of existing varieties of online teaching modes. It propagates the extended E-Learning for the first semester modules that may be extended to a second semester to address team adjustment problems. This paper seeks to show how students can be made to work together in virtual groups before they meet in person. By being in a virtual team prior to physically being present in the university/college, it is proposed that this will reduce the teething problems of group/team work, a necessity in a college learning environment. The additional benefit to colleges/universities in using the recommended extended E-Learning method as an entry mode will be in the reduction in cases of students entering into the country with student visas for vice activities. Data was collected from first year foreign students in a private university in Malaysia to identify the link if any between students of a country to learning style and if the gender had any moderating effects. The findings on this batch of students showed that students from a country do not necessarily have the same learning style and furthermore that gender had no impact on their learning style. This allows for an implementation of study system based on Learning Style without having to consider the country of origin of the students. This study does not intend to negate the results of previous studies linking learning styles to country of origin. However, it shows that in a college environment and specifically in a module or subject the numbers of students from a same country will not be substantial to substantiate the past studies. This study was done in one Applying Theories of Learning Styles in E-Learning with Social Networking Tools private higher educational institute only due to limitation in human resource and finance.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} surveys <b>the</b> <b>social</b> thought <b>and</b> {{activity of}} Metropolitan Sheptytsky, as a contextual instance of Catholic social ethics. Proceeding chronologically through the five major periods which the Metropolitan's career encompassed, it focusses on <b>the</b> key <b>social</b> <b>and</b> political issues that Metropolitan Sheptytsky addressed, {{with a view}} toward shedding new light on his ethical reflection. A close study of the Metropolitan's writings and activity clearly indicates that the operative norms of his theoretical and practical reflection on <b>social</b> <b>and</b> political issues were the Christian principles of love and justice, rather than nationalist or other political principles, as many have suggested. In <b>the</b> <b>social</b> sphere, Sheptytsky's critics and supporters alike have argued that, under his leadership, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church became a national Church, aligned with the Ukrainian national movement. Similarly, Metropolitan Sheptytsky's <b>social</b> thought <b>and</b> activity is commonly {{thought to have been}} influenced by Ukrainian nationalist ideas and influences. The present study of <b>the</b> Metropolitan's <b>social</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> activity calls into question the above supposition, which {{does not appear to be}} supported by the evidence of <b>the</b> Metropolitan's <b>social</b> writings <b>and</b> activity. On the contrary, Sheptytsky's critique of militant nationalism and chauvinism, as well as his advocacy of Christian patriotism reveals that his social reflection was grounded in the Christian ethical norm of fraternal love. Other important <b>social</b> issues that <b>the</b> Metropolitan addressed (the socioeconomic action of the Church, socialism, and communism), and which are examined here also reveal his commitment to the same fundamental norm of Christian ethics. In the political sphere, much has been made of the accomodating posture which the Metropolitan assumed toward states and occupying authorities in each of the periods considered here. By focussing exclusively on those efforts by the Metropolitan to seek a modus vivendi, it has been argued that Sheptytsky was a loyal collaborator with the civil power of the moment. The present study analyzes Metropolitan Sheptytsky's approach to the question of Church-state relations in the five periods. What emerges is a complex approach to Church-state relations, one that was governed by a principle of justice expressed as a reciprocity of rights and duties. In that framework, it becomes clear that the Metropolitan did not consider the accomodationist line in the Pauline call to obey civil authority as an absolute principle, but rather as a rule of thumb which could be overridden by higher principles and values (for example, the state's duty to provide "wise leadership" and to issue "just dictates," and the ultimate precedence of divine over human law). The appeal to those higher principles was based on an assessment of the needs of the concrete situation at hand, and Metropolitan Sheptytsky showed considerable attentiveness to extremely complex and constantly changing situations. Other political issues that Sheptytsky addressed [...] in particular, the delineation of legitimate levels of political activity by priests [...] reveal a similar use of a language of rights and duties, and an underlying commitment to justice as the fundamental norm governing and defining the scope of the political action of the Church.

40|$|Web-based {{learning}} progresses as {{access to}} the Internet grows. As learners and educators in virtual learning communities, we strive for ways to measure how well teachers <b>teach</b> <b>and</b> learners learn. While the literature is replete with articles and books discussing online learning from <b>the</b> perspective of <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> presence, there are few studies that {{examine the relationship between}} cognitive presence and learning effectiveness in an online environment. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the relationship between cognitive presence and learning outcome in an asynchronous discussion forum. Thus, this study examined performance in an online course in relation to student interaction and level of cognitive presence in the course. The data were collected from students enrolled in 10 sections of an online class taught at a large public university in the Southeastern United States. The study was mixed-method in nature. It consisted both of qualitative content analysis and descriptive statistics with Pearson correlations between the dependent variable (student course module grades) and the independent variables (maximum levels of cognitive presence, number of messages and message lengths). The study resulted in two key theoretical contributions. The first is that maximum level of cognitive presence is a better indicator of student learning than mean level of cognitive presence. The results of the study indicate that students achieved mastery of the subject matter over time. Typically cognitive presence has been measured as a mean score for a course. This strategy is akin to giving the student a pre-test on a body of content at the beginning of the lesson, and a post test at the end, and then averaging these two to determine the student’s grade. Doing so seems to ignore, or at least diminish the fact that learning occurs over time. Student mastery of a content is a better indicator of learning than student progress. Thus, this study suggests that a more appropriate measure of student learning, in terms of cognitive presence, is the maximum level reached by every student, rather than the mean level of all students. The second theoretical contribution is that in on-line learning, a student displaying the cognitive presence “Resolution” stage in a discussion may inhibit others from displaying that stage. When a student has posted a message at the resolution stage during a discussion other students are more likely to respond with messages like “I agree” than they are to restate the resolution stage message. The “I agree” type message would not be coded at the resolution stage, thus the student who posted that message would not be seen to have reached that stage, when in fact, he or she may well have done so. This leads to a faulty perception of the overall level of cognitive presence. It may be difficult to control for this inhibitory effect but some creative structuring of course content and assignments should make it possible. Future studies addressing cognitive presence in online learning environments should take both of these ideas into consideration...|$|R
