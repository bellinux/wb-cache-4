5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to orbit Jupiter was the Galileo orbiter, which went into orbit around Jupiter on December 7, 1995. It orbited the planet for over seven years, making 35 orbits {{before it was}} destroyed during a controlled impact with Jupiter on September 21, 2003. During this period, it gathered {{a large amount of}} information about the Jovian system; the amount of information was not as great as intended because the deployment of its high-gain radio <b>transmitting</b> <b>antenna</b> failed. The major events during the eight-year study included multiple flybys of all of the Galilean moons, as well as Amalthea (the first probe to do so). It also witnessed the impact of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 as it approached Jupiter in 1994 and the sending of an atmospheric probe into the Jovian atmosphere in December 1995.|$|E
25|$|Development of a {{prototype}} system followed, with Captain Rex Corput as the Project Officer. Ralph I. Cole headed receiver work and William S. Marks led transmitter improvements. Separate antennas and receivers {{were used for}} azimuth and elevation measurements. These receiving antennas, plus the <b>transmitting</b> <b>antenna,</b> were made of large arrays of dipole wires on wooden frames. The system output was used to aim a searchlight.|$|E
25|$|Some {{types of}} <b>transmitting</b> <b>antenna</b> {{systems in the}} VLF, LF, MF and lower SW range must have a good ground to operate efficiently. For example, a {{vertical}} monopole antenna requires a ground plane that often consists of an interconnected network of wires running radially away {{from the base of}} the antenna for a distance about equal to the height of the antenna. Sometimes a counterpoise is used as a ground plane, supported above the ground.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The Alamouti {{orthogonal}} space–time {{block code}} for two <b>transmit</b> <b>antennas</b> was designed primarily for QAM and PSK modulations, {{and we have}} previously generalized it for the continuous phase modulation (CPM), denoted as OST-CPM, by maintaining the orthogonality (for the fast ML decoding/demodu-lation) and the phase continuity of two signals from two <b>transmit</b> <b>antennas.</b> In this paper, we design orthogonal-like space–time coded CPM systems for three and four <b>transmit</b> <b>antennas</b> based on orthogonal and quasi-orthogonal space–time codes. Although the signals from <b>transmit</b> <b>antennas</b> in the proposed orthog-onal-like space–time coded CPM systems are not orthogonal, the fast decoding/demodulation is maintained like the two <b>transmit</b> <b>antenna</b> case.

This scheme allows {{two or more}} <b>transmit</b> <b>antennas</b> to simultaneously use one radio frequency frontend. A system with four <b>transmit</b> <b>antennas</b> is considered in particular. The four antennas are selectively grouped into two subsets. Alamouti code is then applied {{on top of the}} subsets as if each was a single antenna.

25|$|Radar is an object-detection {{system that}} uses radio waves to {{determine}} the range, angle, or velocity of objects. It {{can be used to}} detect aircraft, ships, spacecraft, guided missiles, motor vehicles, weather formations, and terrain. A radar system consists of a transmitter producing electromagnetic waves in the radio or microwaves domain, a <b>transmitting</b> <b>antenna,</b> a receiving antenna (often the same antenna is used for transmitting and receiving) and a receiver and processor to determine properties of the object(s). Radio waves (pulsed or continuous) from the transmitter reflect off the object and return to the receiver, giving information about the object's location and speed.|$|E

A total of 466 were built {{with the first}} entering service with No. 157 Squadron in January 1942, replacing the Douglas Havoc. These aircraft were similar to the F Mk II, but were fitted with the AI Mk IV metric wavelength radar. The herring-bone <b>transmitting</b> <b>antenna</b> was mounted on the nose and the dipole receiving antennae were carried under the outer wings. A number of NF IIs had their radar equipment removed and additional fuel tanks installed in the bay behind the cannon for use as night intruders.

25|$|Much of the {{material}} launched need not be delivered to its eventual orbit immediately, which {{raises the possibility that}} high efficiency (but slower) engines could move SPS material from LEO to GEO at an acceptable cost. Examples include ion thrusters or nuclear propulsion. Power beaming from geostationary orbit by microwaves carries the difficulty that the required 'optical aperture' sizes are very large. For example, the 1978 NASA SPS study required a 1-km diameter <b>transmitting</b> <b>antenna,</b> and a 10km diameter receiving rectenna, for a microwave beam at 2.45GHz. These sizes can be somewhat decreased by using shorter wavelengths, although they have increased atmospheric absorption and even potential beam blockage by rain or water droplets. Because of the thinned array curse, {{it is not possible to}} make a narrower beam by combining the beams of several smaller satellites. The large size of the transmitting and receiving antennas means that the minimum practical power level for an SPS will necessarily be high; small SPS systems will be possible, but uneconomic.|$|E
2500|$|At typical {{communication}} {{distances from}} a transmitter, the <b>transmitting</b> <b>antenna</b> usually can {{be approximated by}} a point source. [...] Doubling the distance of a receiver from a transmitter means that the power density of the radiated wave at that new location is reduced to one-quarter of its previous value.|$|E
2500|$|A {{commonly}} proposed {{approach to}} ensuring fail-safe beam targeting {{is to use}} a retrodirective phased array antenna/rectenna. A [...] "pilot" [...] microwave beam emitted {{from the center of the}} rectenna on the ground establishes a phase front at the <b>transmitting</b> <b>antenna.</b> There, circuits in each of the antenna's subarrays compare the pilot beam's phase front with an internal clock phase to control the phase of the outgoing signal. This forces the transmitted beam to be centered precisely on the rectenna and to have a high degree of phase uniformity; if the pilot beam is lost for any reason (if the <b>transmitting</b> <b>antenna</b> is turned away from the rectenna, for example) the phase control value fails and the microwave power beam is automatically defocused. Such a system would be physically incapable of focusing its power beam anywhere that did not have a pilot beam transmitter. The long-term effects of beaming power through the ionosphere in the form of microwaves has yet to be studied, but nothing has been suggested which might lead to any significant effect.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "circular polarization" [...] {{is often}} used erroneously to {{describe}} mixed polarity signals used mostly in FM radio (87.5 to 108.0MHz in the USA), where a vertical and a horizontal component are propagated simultaneously by a single or a combined array.

[...] In a <b>transmitting</b> <b>antenna,</b> XPD is the fraction of power from an antenna of one polarization radiated in the other polarization. [...] For example, due to minor imperfections a dish with a vertically polarized feed antenna will radiate {{a small amount of}} its power in horizontal polarization; this fraction is the XPD.
