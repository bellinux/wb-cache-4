This paper adds to the growing literature which uses survey-based long-run forecasts of inflation to estimate <b>trend</b> <b>inflation.</b> We develop a bivariate model of inflation and long-run forecasts of inflation which allows for the estimation of the link between <b>trend</b> <b>inflation</b> and the long-run forecast. Thus, our model allows for the possibilities that long-run forecasts taken from surveys can be equated with <b>trend</b> <b>inflation,</b> that the two are completely unrelated, or anything in between. By including stochastic volatility and time-variation in coefficients, it extends existing methods in empirically important ways. We use our model with a variety of inflation measures and survey-based forecasts for several countries.

The bounds of this interval can either be fixed or estimated from the data. Our model also allows for a time varying degree of persistence in the transitory component of inflation.

As compared to the year-ended headline rate, the statistical test results, however, support only the measure of market prices excluding volatile items, not the others. There is some weak evidence of the weighted median measure outperforming the headline rate in the sub-period after 1993.
