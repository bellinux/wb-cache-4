5|$|Although {{the road}} had been opened between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri, the convoy {{still had to}} fight through the {{numerous}} Chinese positions on the hills overlooking the road. On {{the first night of}} the retreat, the Chinese struck the convoy in force and inflicted heavy casualties upon 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines (3/5). Although strong air cover suppressed most of the Chinese forces {{for the rest of the}} march, the cold weather, harassing fire, raiding parties, and road blocks slowed the retreat <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>crawl</b> while inflicting numerous casualties. Despite those difficulties, the convoy reached Hagaru-ri in an orderly fashion on the afternoon of 3 December, with the withdrawal completed on 4 December.|$|E
5|$|Emerging in {{the mid-1980s}} with such bands as California's Saint Vitus, Maryland's The Obsessed, Chicago's Trouble, and Sweden's Candlemass, the doom metal {{movement}} rejected other metal styles' emphasis on speed, slowing its music <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>crawl.</b> Doom metal traces its roots to the lyrical themes and musical approach of early Black Sabbath. The Melvins have also been a significant influence on doom metal {{and a number of}} its subgenres. Doom emphasizes melody, melancholy tempos, and a sepulchral mood relative to many other varieties of metal.|$|E

Chaotic fighting broke out within the column and the retreat was slowed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>crawl.</b> The Marine night fighters, however, returned to subdue the Chinese forces, and the fighting destroyed most of the blocking troops. On 7 December, the rest of the column managed to reach Koto-ri with little difficulty with the last elements arrived at Koto-ri that night.|$|E

Confederate commander-in-chief Joseph E. Johnston fended off McClellan's repeated attempts to take the city, slowing Union progress on the peninsula <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>crawl.</b> When Johnston was wounded, Lee took command and launched a series of counterattacks, collectively called the Seven Days Battles.

5|$|By 1300 only Harlech and Conwy {{had been}} {{properly}} completed: Caernarfon's town walls were finished, {{but much of}} the castle was still incomplete and at Beaumaris Castle the inner walls was only half their intended height, with gaps in the outer walls. By 1304 the total building programme in Wales had come to at least £80,000, almost six times Edward's annual income. Edward had meanwhile become embroiled in a long-running sequence of wars in Scotland which began to consume his attention and financial resources, and as a result further work on the Welsh castles slowed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>crawl.</b> In 1306 Edward became concerned about a possible Scottish invasion of North Wales, spurring fresh construction work, but money remained much more limited than before. By 1330 all new work had finally ceased, and Caernarfon and Beaumaris were never fully completed.|$|E

Fearing attack by Britain and France, the Board switched priority to the smaller s shortly afterwards in the belief that they could be completed more quickly so that progress on Kreml slowed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>crawl</b> once construction began on 2 October.

5|$|Racer's {{hurricane}} was {{a destructive}} tropical cyclone that had severe effects on northeastern Mexico and the Gulf Coast of the United States in early October1837. It takes {{its name from}} the Royal Navy ship Racer, which sustained some damage when it encountered the hurricane in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. The storm first affected Jamaica with flooding rainfall and strong winds on September26 and27, before entering the Gulf of Mexico by October1. As the hurricane approached northern Tamaulipas and southern Texas, it slowed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>crawl</b> and turned sharply eastward. The storm battered the GulfCoast from Texas to the Florida Panhandle between October3 and7, and after crossing the Southeastern United States, it emerged into the Atlantic shipping lanes off the Carolinas. For most of the storm's duration, the strongest winds and heaviest rains were confined to the northern side of its track.|$|E
5|$|The cyclone's 1-minute winds {{increased}} {{once again}} to 140km/h, marking its second and final peak at 0000 UTC on November 18. The JMA, however, maintained Nepartak as a severe tropical storm. The JTWC indicated that 25W made a second landfall {{on the coast of}} Hainan, although the JMA did not make such mention, implying Nepartak's center remained over the Gulf of Tonkin. Regardless, the cyclone's circulation had obscured most of Hainan and the Gulf of Tonkin and reached into adjacent Vietnam, and its forward speed slowed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>crawl.</b> Extended interaction with land proved detrimental to the storm, and it began to rapidly disintegrate. Just 18 hours after its final bout of strengthening, Nepartak had been reduced to an exposed circulation center with no associated thunderstorms. Turning toward the northeast, the system had been concurrently downgraded to a tropical depression by the JTWC and JMA early on November 19. The weak remnant low of Nepartak limped ashore over Beihai, China at 1900 UTC and dissipated shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Though many {{remained}} unimpressed, Oppenheimer appointed Neddermeyer {{the head}} of a new group to test implosion. His group became the E-5 (Implosion) Group, which was part of Captain William S. Parsons' E Division. A gun-type nuclear weapon was the preferred method, but implosion research constituted a backup. Neddermeyer embarked on an intensive series of experiments testing cylindrical implosions. The result was a series of distorted shapes. Progress was made; Neddermeyer and a member of his team, Hugh Bradner, along with James L. Tuck from the British Mission, conceived the idea of explosive lenses, in which shaped charges are used to focus the force of an explosion. Nevertheless, seemingly unsolvable problems with shock wave uniformity brought progress on implosion <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>crawl.</b>|$|E

30|$|In one {{especially}} prescient example, {{the idea}} of a ‘self-portrait camera stick’ was introduced. At the time, {{the idea of}} taking self-portraits with a specially engineered extendible stick seemed about as absurd as tying rags <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>crawling</b> baby and calling that a mop. But as so often is the case, reality has ended up reifying the previously surreal, and the ‘selfie-stick’ is now a (seemingly) fixed part of the urban experience—one that has even generated its own neologism—the ‘selfie’. To many, the sight of individuals hauling around mobile phones on sticks in order to generate self-images that demonstrate their presence at famous locations has become an apocryphal signifier of the stupidity of modern life. And even though there are more efficient options available (such as asking someone to take your photograph) the selfie stick has taken on an air of apparent indispensability in a very short time.|$|R

In fact, his imagination and his intelligence operations failed him; the proportions were roughly the reverse. During Johnston's slow retreat up the Peninsula, his forces practiced deceptive operations. In particular, the division under John B.
