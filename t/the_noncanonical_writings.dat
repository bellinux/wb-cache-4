50|$|The Wnt {{signaling}} pathways are a {{group of}} signal transduction pathways made of proteins that pass signals into a cell through cell surface receptors. Three Wnt signaling pathways have been characterized: the canonical Wnt pathway, <b>the</b> <b>noncanonical</b> planar cell polarity pathway, and <b>the</b> <b>noncanonical</b> Wnt/calcium pathway. All three pathways are activated by binding a Wnt-protein ligand to a Frizzled family receptor, which passes the biological signal to the Dishevelled protein inside the cell. The canonical Wnt pathway leads to regulation of gene transcription, and {{is thought to be}} negatively regulated in part by the SPATS1 gene. <b>The</b> <b>noncanonical</b> planar cell polarity pathway regulates the cytoskeleton that is responsible for the shape of <b>the</b> cell. <b>The</b> <b>noncanonical</b> Wnt/calcium pathway regulates calcium inside the cell. Wnt signaling pathways use either nearby cell-cell communication (paracrine) or same-cell communication (autocrine). They are highly evolutionarily conserved in animals, which means they are similar across animal species from fruit flies to humans.|$|R

40|$|Follicular helper T (Tfh) {{cells have}} {{a central role}} in {{mediating}} humoral immune responses. Generation of Tfh cells depends on both T-cell intrinsic factors and the supporting function of B cells, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here we show that NF-κB–inducing kinase (NIK), a central component of <b>the</b> <b>noncanonical</b> NF-κB signaling pathway, is required for Tfh cell development. Unlike other known Tfh regulators, NIK acts by controlling the supporting function of B cells. NIK and its upstream BAFF receptor regulate B-cell expression of inducible costimulator ligand (ICOSL), a molecule required for Tfh cell generation. Consistently, injection of a recombinant ICOSL protein into NIK-deficient mice largely rescues their defect in Tfh cell development. We provide biochemical and genetic evidence indicating that the ICOSL gene is a specific target of <b>the</b> <b>noncanonical</b> NF-κB.

40|$|Proper {{activation}} of nuclear factor (NF) –κB transcription factors {{is critical in}} regulating fundamental biological processes such as cell survival and proliferation, {{as well as in}} inflammatory and immune responses. Recently, the NF-κB signaling pathways have been categorized into the canonical pathway, which results in the nuclear translocation of NF-κB complexes containing p 50, and <b>the</b> <b>noncanonical</b> pathway, which involves the induced processing of p 100 to p 52 and the formation of NF-κB complexes containing p 52 (Bonizzi, G., and M. Karin. 2004. Trends Immunol. 25 : 280 – 288). We demonstrate that loss of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor–associated factor 3 (TRAF 3) results in constitutive noncanonical NF-κB activity. Importantly, TRAF 3 −/− B cells show ligand-independent up-regulation of intracellular adhesion molecule 1 and protection from spontaneous apoptosis during in vitro culture. In addition, we demonstrate that loss of TRAF 3 results in profound accumulation of NF-κB–inducing kinase in TRAF 3 −/− cells. Finally, we show that the early postnatal lethality observed in TRAF 3 -deficient mice is rescued by compound loss of <b>the</b> <b>noncanonical</b> NF-κB p 100 gene. Thus, these genetic data clearly demonstrate that TRAF 3 is a critical negative modulator of <b>the</b> <b>noncanonical</b> NF-κB pathway and that constitutive {{activation of}} <b>the</b> <b>noncanonical</b> NF-κB pathway causes the lethal phenotype of TRAF 3 -deficient mice...|$|R
40|$|Hexameric AAA+ ATPases induce {{conformational}} {{changes in}} a variety of macromolecules. AAA+ structures contain the nucleotide-binding P-loop with the Walker A sequence motif: GxxGxGK(T/S). A subfamily of AAA+ sequences contains Asn in the Walker A motif instead of Thr or Ser. This noncanonical subfamily includes torsinA, an ER protein linked to human dystonia and DnaC, a bacterial helicase loader. Role of <b>the</b> <b>noncanonical</b> Walker A motif in the functionality of AAA+ ATPases has not been explored yet. To determine functional effects of introduction of Asn into the Walker A sequence, we replaced the Walker-A Thr with Asn in ClpB, a bacterial AAA+ chaperone which reactivates aggregated proteins. We found that the T-to-N mutation in Walker A partially inhibited the ATPase activity of ClpB, but did not affect the ClpB capability to associate into hexamers. Interestingly, <b>the</b> <b>noncanonical</b> Walker A sequence in ClpB induced preferential binding of ADP vs. ATP and uncoupled the linkage between the ATP-bound conformation and the high-affinity binding to protein aggregates. As a consequence, ClpB with <b>the</b> <b>noncanonical</b> Walker A sequence showed a low chaperone activity in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrate a novel role of the Walker-A Thr in sensing the nucleotide's γ-phosphate and in maintaining an allosteric linkage between the P-loop and the aggregate binding site of ClpB.

Activation of <b>the</b> <b>noncanonical</b> NF-κB pathway involves degradation of an inhibitory protein, TNF receptor associated factor 3 (TRAF 3), but how this signaling event is controlled is still unknown 1, 2. Here we have identified the deubiquitinase Otud 7 b as a pivotal regulator of <b>the</b> <b>noncanonical</b> NF-κB pathway. Otud 7 b deficiency in mice has no appreciable effect on canonical NF-κB activation but causes hyper-activation of noncanonical NF-κB. In response to noncanonical NF-κB stimuli, Otud 7 b binds and deubiquitinates TRAF 3, thereby inhibiting TRAF 3 proteolysis and preventing aberrant noncanonical NF-κB activation. Consequently, the Otud 7 b deficiency results in B-cell hyperresponsiveness to antigens, lymphoid follicular hyperplasia in the intestinal mucosa, and elevated host-defense ability against an intestinal bacterial pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium.

40|$|The {{appearance}} of inner brane structure {{is an interesting}} issue in domain wall brane model. Because such structure usually leads to quasilocalized modes of various kinds of bulk fields. In this paper, we construct a domain wall brane model by using a scalar field ϕ, which couples to its kinetic term. The inner brane structure emerges as the scalar-kinetic coupling increases. With such brane structure, we show {{that it is possible}} to obtain gravity resonant modes in both tensor and scalar sectors. The number of the resonant modes depends on the vacuum expectation value of ϕ and the form of scalar-kinetic coupling. The correspondence between our model and the canonical one is also discussed. <b>The</b> <b>noncanonical</b> and canonical background scalar fields are connected by an integral equation, while the warp factor remains the same. Via this correspondence, <b>the</b> canonical and <b>noncanonical</b> models share <b>the</b> same linear perturbation spectrum.
