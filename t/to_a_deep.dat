5|$|A low {{pressure}} area developed in the northern Bay of Bengal on June 6 and developed into a depression the next day as it drifted to the north, moving over south of the Ganges Delta. The depression reversed its course overland, reemerging into the Bay of Bengal on June 8. Once over water, the depression intensified into a cyclonic storm {{on the morning of}} June 9. The cyclone's motion shifted to the northwest and it made a second landfall near Balasore in northern Orissa that night. The cyclone quickly weakened <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> depression overland and tracked to the west over central India, where it degenerated into a broad area of {{low pressure}} on June 11.|$|E
5|$|A trough {{developed}} {{along the}} northeast monsoon on 25October 2015 off the southwest coast of India, {{consisting of a}} fragmented area of convection, or thunderstorms. The system was located within an environment of moderate wind shear, which prevented early development, although conditions were anticipated to become more favorable. On 26October, the system developed a distinct low pressure area. The low gradually consolidated, and the circulation became better defined, amplified by decreasing wind shear and good outflow {{to the north and}} south. At 03:00UTC on 28October, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as a depression. Nine hours later, the agency upgraded it further <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> depression, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 04A at 21:00UTC.|$|E

5|$|As {{the wind}} shear decreased, the {{convection}} increased further, and the IMD upgraded the system <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> depression at 00:00UTC on June1. Later that day, the system began rapidly intensifying while moving on a northwest trajectory; the IMD upgraded {{the system to}} a cyclonic storm at 09:00UTC, naming it Phet. An eye became evident during a Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) pass of the storm; its appearance {{and the development of}} rainbands showed Phet was intensifying. Late on June1, the JTWC upgraded the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, estimating 1minute maximum sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph), after the eye became better defined and the tightly-curved thunderstorm activity. The IMD upgraded Phet to severe cyclonic storm status at 00:00UTC on June2, and further to a very severe cyclonic storm six hours later.|$|E
5|$|Convection {{continued}} {{to organize and}} deepen as the nascent depression continued west-northwestward, steered by a ridge to the north. However, dry air from the Arabian Peninsula and cooler waters proved deleterious to the system, and the circulation became more disorganized on October30. Despite the marginally favorable conditions, the overall structure improved on November1, with pronounced outflow developing along the western periphery. A nearby buoy reported a barometric pressure of , which confirmed the increasing organization. At 03:00UTC on November1, the IMD upgraded the depression <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> depression, and 24hours later to Cyclonic Storm Keila. By that time, the agency estimated peak 3minute sustained winds of 65km/h (40mph) while the storm was just 150km (95mi) southeast of Oman. The American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also designated the system as Tropical Cyclone 03A at 03:00UTC on November2.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} the alert was issued, deep {{convection}} disappeared from the low while located 400mi (645km). Convection was anticipated to redeveloped later that night or early the next morning. The low was moving slowly towards the northwest due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> trough located over the Gulf of Mexico and a ridge of high pressure located over western Mexico. By the morning of July 3, convection had redeveloped near the low and its forward motion quickly increased to 11mph (18km/h). The low remained disorganized {{for the next two}} days as it steadily moved towards the northwest.|$|E

5|$|The JTWC {{estimated}} Mala to {{have been}} a stronger system, with peak winds of 220km/h (140mph) and a pressure of 922mb (hPa; 27.23inHg)— equivalent to a Category4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Their Dvorak values peaked at T#6.5 or 235km/h (146mph). As the powerful storm approached Myanmar, the combined effects of increasing wind shear and land interaction soon took their toll on Mala. At 0700UTC on April29, Mala made landfall just south of Thandwe in Myanmar's Rakhine State as a very severe cyclonic storm. The JTWC estimated winds at this time {{to have been}} 165km/h (105mph). Rapid weakening ensued once the cyclone moved onshore. Within 12hours of landfall, Mala weakened <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> depression and was last noted as a dissipating system earl on April30.|$|E
5|$|After passing {{just north}} of Somalia, Megh progressed westward into the Gulf of Aden, the {{waterway}} between Somalia and the Arabian Peninsula. This {{marked the first time}} on record when two storms entered the body of water in the same year. By 12:00UTC on November9, the center was beginning to become exposed from the convection due to the unfavorable conditions. Throughout the day, the structure rapidly deteriorated as the storm curved to the west-northwest. At 21:00UTC on November9, Megh weakened further into a severe cyclonic storm, and degraded further to a cyclonic storm by six hours later. While just offshore Yemen, the circulation slowed and turned to the northeast, after the ridge to the north receded eastward. At 06:00UTC on November10 the storm weakened <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> depression, and three hours later Megh made landfall in southwestern Yemen northeast of Zinjibar, with estimated winds of 55km/h (35mph). The structure eroded significantly over land, prompting the JTWC to discontinue advisories. The circulation continued inland, and Megh degenerated into a low pressure area by 18:00UTC on November10.|$|E
5|$|After peaking in intensity, {{the storm}} began {{weakening}} due to increasing easterly wind shear from the ridge to the north, displacing {{the center of}} circulation from the deepest convection. Early on May14, the IMD downgraded the storm to a severe cyclonic storm. Around this time, steering currents slackened, and the cyclone meandered northward over the central Bay of Bengal. By late on May14, convection had largely dissipated, {{with the exception of}} a small area near the center, and the system weakened to minimal cyclonic storm status. Thunderstorm activity continued to wax and wane as the storm turned to the southeastward, though persistent hostile conditions caused the storm to weaken further <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> depression on May16. As the nearby ridge translated eastward, the depression was able to move more steadily to the east and later to the northeast, passing northwest of the Andaman Islands on May18. On the next day, the deep depression re-intensified into a cyclonic storm, reaching a secondary peak with winds of 85km/h (50mph). At about 10:00UTC on May19, the storm made landfall close to Kyaukpyu, Ramree Island, in western Myanmar. The storm rapidly weakened into a depression and later degenerated into a low pressure area on May20, and was no longer discernible on satellite imagery by the next day.|$|E

5|$|Boletellus ananas, {{commonly}} known as the pineapple bolete, is a mushroom in the family Boletaceae, and the type species of the genus Boletellus. It is distributed in southeastern North America, northeastern South America, Asia, and New Zealand, where it grows scattered or in groups on the ground, often at the base of oak and pine trees. The fruit body is characterized by the reddish-pink (or pinkish-tan to yellowish if an older specimen) scales on the cap that are often found hanging from the edge. The pore surface {{on the underside of the}} cap is made of irregular or angular pores up to 2mm wide that bruise a blue color. It is yellow when young but ages <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> olive-brown color. Microscopically, B.ananas is distinguished by large spores with cross striae on the ridges and spirally encrusted hyphae in the marginal appendiculae and flesh of the stem. Previously known as Boletus ananas and Boletus coccinea (among other synonyms), the species was given its current name by William Alphonso Murrill in 1909. Two varieties of Boletellus ananas have been described. Although the mushroom may be considered edible, it is not recommended for consumption.|$|E
5|$|In May 2003, a {{tropical}} cyclone officially called Very Severe Cyclonic Storm BOB 01 produced the worst flooding in Sri Lanka in 56years. The first storm of the 2003 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, it {{developed over the}} Bay of Bengal on May10. Favorable environmental conditions allowed the system to intensify steadily while moving northwestward. The storm reached peak maximum sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph) on May13, making it a very severe cyclonic storm according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which is the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the basin. The cyclone drifted north over the central Bay of Bengal, gradually weakening due to heightened wind shear. Turning eastward, the storm deteriorated <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> depression on May 16 before it curved northeastward and re-intensified into a cyclonic storm. It came ashore in western Myanmar and dissipated over land the following day.|$|E
5|$|Later on October1, the JTWC issued {{their first}} {{advisory}} on the storm, classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 03A. Tracking towards the northeast, Onil intensified as convection consolidated around {{the center of}} circulation. Roughly 24hours after being named, the system attained its peak intensity as a severe cyclonic storm with winds of 100km/h (65mph) and a barometric pressure of 990mbar (hPa; 29.23inHg) according to the IMD with. Upon reaching this strength, the system featured a pinhole eye surrounded by deep convection. Additionally, Dvorak technique intensity estimates reached 3.5, indicating a high-end tropical storm. However, the JTWC stated maximum winds to be 65km/h (40mph), a low-end tropical storm. As the storm neared the Indian coastline, dry air quickly entered the circulation, causing most of the convection associated with Onil to dissipate. Located within 100km (65mi) of land, the JTWC downgraded the system to a tropical depression and the IMD downgraded Onil <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> depression.|$|E

5|$|On November3, {{an area of}} {{scattered}} convection persisted about 860km (535mi) {{southwest of}} Mumbai, India, in the central Arabian Sea. The thunderstorms were associated with a weak and broad circulation, located {{in an area of}} low wind shear and warm water temperatures over , both favorable conditions. At the time, the system was located east of Cyclone Chapala, which had recently struck Yemen. On November4, a distinct low pressure area developed in association with a mid- to upper-level low, while the region was in an active Madden Julian Oscillation phase favorable for storm development. The circulation became better defined as outflow increased, amplified by an anticyclone over the system. Based on the organization, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the low as a depression at 00:00UTC on November5. About six hours later, the IMD upgraded the system <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> depression, and at 12:00UTC that day the agency upgraded it to a cyclonic storm, naming it Megh. Earlier that day, the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on the storm as Tropical Cyclone 05A while the storm was about 1,120km (700mi) east of Socotra island offshore Yemen.|$|E
