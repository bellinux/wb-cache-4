He {{had heard of}} the attempt to land an aircraft on Helvellyn earlier that month, but the flyers John F. Leeming and Bert Hinkler had been delayed by weather and mechanic problems. The earlier attempts would have been recorded by Mr. Sandham, the manager of Thirlmere reservoir, who made a previous reconnaissance visit with Leeming to clear a landing strip. He decided on another attempt, but unfortunately by this time Sandham had retired from the mountain. After an eventful bumpy flight over the Lake District they spiralled down to the summit. No doubt looking for the cleared strip. Leeming also noticed someone sheltering at the summit cairn. A witness (E.R. Dodds).

Roughness geometry is modeled {{as a series of}} triangular obstructions. The relative roughness from 0 % to 2. 65 % was considered. Because for truly compressible flow we have no fully developed flow condition, the simulation is performed over the whole length of the channel. A wide range of Mach numbers is considered, from nearly incompressible <b>to</b> <b>chocked</b> flow conditions. Flow conditions with a Reynolds number up to around 200 were computed. The outlet Knudsen number corresponding to the chosen range of Mach and Reynolds number ranges from a very low value to 0. 0249. Performance charts are presented in terms of both average and local Poiseuille number as a function of local Knudsen, Mach, and Reynolds numbers. In particular, it appears that roughness strongly decreases the reduction in pressure loss due to rarefaction. Thus, the roughness effect is stronger at a high Knudsen. Furthermore, the compressibility effect has a major effect on pressure drop when the local Mach number exceeds 0. 3...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Todays {{guidelines}} for advanced CPR emphasize chest compressions with good quality and early defibrillation. Prehospital CPR performed by ambulance crew, an {{automated external defibrillator}} (AED) is used. The AED analyzes the heart rhythm and the performer is following the advice <b>to</b> <b>chock</b> the heart or not, given by the AED. During on-going CPR there are sequences when no chest compression is performed known as hands-off time. Hands-off time includes {{the time for the}} AED to analyze the heart rhythm and the time when advice is given to the crew. Studies show that prolonged hands-off time has a negative impact on survival after a sudden cardiac arrest.  Purpose The purpose with this study was to look into if the hands-off time could decrease with use of manual mode on the defibrillator by the ambulance crew. The crew had to analyze, make a decision <b>to</b> <b>chock</b> or not, charge the defibrillator and give the chock if appropriate. Furthermore, the crews’ knowledge in analyzing heart rhythms that can be defibrillate was investigated.   Method A quasi-experimental method was used. 38 participants, all ambulance crew, were included in the study. The participants were randomized into two groups. One group performed CPR with an AED, the second group used the manual mode on the defibrillator. The study data were processed in SPSS.  Results The time preceding the first defibrillation was significant shorter in the group using manual mode. There was no difference in total hands-off time between the two groups.  All heart rhythms were interpreted right and all defibrillation were done correctly.  Conclusions Time from establish cardiac arrest to first defibrillation was significant shorter in manual mode. Furthermore, all heart rhythms were interpreted right and all defibrillation were done correctly.  Time from first defibrillation to start of chest compressions was equal in the two groups.  There {{were no significant differences in}} hands-off time between the two groups.    Keyword: ambulance, cardiac arrest, automatic external defibrillator, manual defibrillator, manual rhythm analyze, hands-off time...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{examined}} whether {{individuals can}} fake {{their responses to}} a personality inventory if instructed to do so. Between-subjects and within-subject designs were meta-analyzed separately. Across 51 studies, fakability did not vary by personality dimension; all the Big Five factors were equally fakable. Faking produced the largest distortions in social desirability scales. Instructions to fake good produced lower effect sizes compared with instructions to fake bad. Comparing meta-analytic results from within-subjects and between-subjects designs, we conclude, based on statistical and methodological consid-erations, that within-subjects designs produce more accurate estimates. Between-subjects designs may distort estimates due to Subject · Treatment interactions and low statistical power. Recent years have seen a resurgence of interest in personality variables in industrial-organizational psychology (cf. Barrick & Mount, 1991).

40|$|Following the {{criticism}} by Chock and Gutfreund [Chock, P. B. & Gutfreund, H. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 8870 - 8874], that our proposal of direct transfer of NADH between glycerol- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (alpha-glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase, alpha-GDH; EC 1. 1. 1. 8) and L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; EC 1. 1. 1. 27) {{was based on}} a misinterpretation of the kinetic data, we have reinvestigated the transfer mechanism between this enzyme pair. By using the "enzyme buffering" steady-state kinetic technique [Srivastava, D. K. & Bernhard, S. A. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 4538 - 4545], we examined the mechanism (random diffusion vs. direct transfer) of transfer of NADH between rabbit muscle alpha-GDH and pig heart LDH. The steady-state data reveal that the LDH-NADH complex and the alpha-GDH-NADH complex can serve as substrate for the alpha-GDH-catalyzed reaction and the LDH-catalyzed reaction, respectively. This is consistent with the direct-transfer mechanism and inconsistent with a mechanism in which free NADH is the only competent substrate for either enzyme-catalyzed reaction. The discrepancy between this conclusion and that of Chock and Gutfreund comes from (i) their incorrect measurement of the Km for NADH in the alpha-GDH-catalyzed reaction, (ii) inadequate design and range of the steady-state kinetic experiments, and (iii) their qualitative assessment of the prediction of the direct-transfer mechanism. Our transient kinetic measurements for the transfer of NADH from alpha-GDH to LDH and from LDH to alpha-GDH show that both are slower than predicted on the basis of free equilibration of NADH through the aqueous environment. The decrease in the rate of equilibration of NADH between alpha-GDH and LDH provides no support for the random-diffusion mechanism; rather, it suggests a direct interaction between enzymes that modulates the transfer rate of NADH. Thus, contrary <b>to</b> <b>Chock</b> and Gutfreund's conclusion, all our experimental data compel us to propose, once again, that NADH is transferred directly between the sites of alpha-GDH and LDH...|$|E

40|$|High {{pressure}} drop and high length to hydraulic diameter ratios yield significant compressibility effects in microchannel flows, which compete with rarefaction phenomena at the smaller scale. In such regimes, flow field and temperature field {{are no longer}} decoupled. In presence of significant heat transfer, and combined with the effect of viscous dissipation, this yields to a quite complex thermo-fluid dynamic problem. A finite volume compressible solver, including generalized Maxwell slip flow and temperature jump boundary conditions suitable for arbitrary geometries, is adopted. Roughness geometry is modeled {{as a series of}} triangular shaped obstructions, and relative roughness from 0 % to 2. 65 % were considered. The chosen geometry allows for direct comparison with {{pressure drop}} computations carried out, in a previous paper, under adiabatic conditions. A wide range of Mach number is considered, from nearly incompressible <b>to</b> <b>chocked</b> flow conditions. Flow conditions with Reynolds number up to around 300 were computed. The outlet Knudsen number corresponding to the chosen range of Mach and Reynolds number ranges from very low value to around 0. 05, and the competing effects of rarefaction, compressibility and roughness are investigated in detail. Compressibility is found to be the most dominant effect at high Mach number, yielding even inversion of heat flux, while roughness has a strong effect in the case of rarefied flow. Furthermore, the mutual interaction between heat transfer and pressure drop is highlighted, comparing Poiseuille number values for both cooled and heated flows with previous adiabatic computation...|$|R

The introduction of theoretically more accurate light beam timing required that all cars provide a consistent surface with which to break the beam at both start and finish of the timed section.
