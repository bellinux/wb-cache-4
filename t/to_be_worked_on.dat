25|$|In 1905 Widor and Schweitzer {{were among}} the six musicians who founded the Paris Bach Society, a choir {{dedicated}} to performing J.S. Bach's music, for whose concerts Schweitzer took the organ part regularly until 1913. He was also appointed organist for the Bach Concerts of the Orféo Català at Barcelona and often travelled there for that purpose. He and Widor collaborated on a new edition of Bach's organ works, with detailed analysis of each work in three languages (English, French, German). Schweitzer, who insisted that the score should show Bach's notation with no additional markings, wrote the commentaries for the Preludes and Fugues, and Widor those for the Sonatas and Concertos: six volumes were published in 1912–14. Three more, to contain the Chorale Preludes with Schweitzer's analyses, were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> in Africa: but these were never completed, perhaps because for him they were inseparable from his evolving theological thought.|$|E

500|$|FuseFX {{serves as}} the lead visual effects vendor for Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., with {{additional}} work by Pixomondo, Cosa, Greenhaus GFX, Lion VFX, and Synaptic. The series sees an average of 80 to 150 visual effects shots per episodes, with 10 to 12 days {{to work on the}} effects for one episode once background plates have been received from filming. This equates to approximately 2000 visual effects shots per season. [...] Mark Kolpack serves as visual effects supervisor for the series. David Altenau was the in-house supervisor at FuseFX for [...] "Pilot" [...] through episode eight, with Kevin Lingenfelser taking over for subsequent episodes. VFX producer Andrea D'Amico joined the team at FuseFX to work on the series in December 2015. Two separate production management and creative teams were established to work on the show, and producers, compositors and various artists were able to alternate episodes. This was important because most of the episodes had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> concurrently, either two or three at a time. Typical effects for the series include the creation of character-driving effects animation, photo-realistic vehicles, CG set extensions, pyrotechnics, and atmospheric effects.

The following day, in about five hours, Barrett recorded vocal and guitar tracks for four recently recorded songs, starting with [...] "Opel", and two old ones. Barrett and his new producer were in agreement that [...] "Opel" [...] was among {{the best of the}} new recordings at this time; only two complete takes of the song were taped, though, after multiple false starts. The next song attempted was [...] "Love You", the first take of which featured a faster tempo than the officially released take 2. After [...] "Love You", they recorded [...] "It's No Good Trying", which was similarly completed in just a few takes. Barrett was in [...] "great form, and very happy", Jones recalled, and [...] "very together". During the lunch break that day, they talked about improving some of the other songs from the Jenner sessions, particularly [...] "Golden Hair" [...] and [...] "Late Night", the last of which was just a backing track at this point.

2500|$|Sorcerer {{marked the}} first Hollywood film score for the German krautrock and {{electronic}} band Tangerine Dream. William Friedkin, during his visit in Germany, attended their concert in a derelict church in the Black Forest. The band seemed to him [...] "on {{the cutting edge of}} the electronic synthesizer sound" [...] that soon would become a staple in mainstream culture. He assessed their music as a mixture of classical music played on synthesizers and [...] "the new pop sound", and described the experience as [...] "mesmerizing". In an interview for Evolution Garden Music Award, Edgar Froese, then-band leader, recalled how he initially rejected the commission, thinking that Friedkin would score The Exorcist II, about which Froese was not enthusiastic. However, upon learning Friedkin intended to reimagine Wages of Fear, Froese called Friedkin back and asked for video material <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>worked</b> <b>on,</b> but Friedkin suggested the band create the score based solely on their impressions of the script, without seeing a single minute of video footage. After initially meeting in Paris, Froese reports Friedkin was delighted with their work; Froese added that they [...] "never had to change anything on that score" [...] and summarized their involvement as [...] "the most uncomplicated work we did for Hollywood". Upon receiving the commissioned audio material, Friedkin was inspired to edit the film according to the music, which he received in a raw, unabridged form.|$|E
