5|$|Traditionally, living <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{divided into}} five kingdoms: Monera; Protista; Fungi; Plantae; Animalia. However, many {{scientists}} now consider this five-kingdom system outdated. Modern alternative classification systems generally {{begin with the}} three-domain system: Archaea (originally Archaebacteria); Bacteria (originally Eubacteria) and Eukaryota (including protists, fungi, plants, and animals) These domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not, as well as differences in the chemical composition of key biomolecules such as ribosomes.|$|E

25|$|Legal writing values precedent, as {{distinct}} from authority. Precedent means the way <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> done before. For example, a lawyer who must prepare a contract and who has prepared a similar contract before will often re-use, with limited changes, the old contract for the new occasion. Or a lawyer who has filed a successful motion to dismiss a lawsuit may use the same or a very similar form of motion again in another case, and so on. Many lawyers use and re-use written documents in this way and call these re-usable documents templates or, less commonly, forms.|$|E

During these centuries many other <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> wrongly defined, for example, that the Divine essence neither is begotten nor begets, that the soul is the substantial form of the human body, and the like assertions, which are made without reason or sense, as the Cardinal of Cambray himself admits.|$|E

500|$|When Jackson {{bought a}} pet {{chimpanzee}} named Bubbles, the media {{viewed it as}} evidence of Jackson's increasing detachment from reality. It was also reported that Jackson had offered to buy the bones of Joseph Merrick, the [...] "Elephant Man"; Jackson stated that the story was [...] "a complete lie." [...] These stories inspired the nickname [...] "Wacko Jacko", which Jackson acquired the following year, and would come to despise. Another frequent response from the media was about Jackson's plastic surgery.

500|$|The {{aristocracy}} of the Burgundian Netherlands, {{influenced by}} the humanist movement, were the most likely collectors of Bosch's paintings, but there are few records of the location of his works {{in the years immediately}} following his death. It is probable that the patron of the work was Engelbrecht II of Nassau, who died in 1504, or his successor Henry III of Nassau-Breda, the governor of several of the Habsburg provinces in the Low Countries. De Beatis wrote in his travel journal that [...] "there are some panels on which bizarre <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> painted. They represent seas, skies, woods, meadows, and many other things, such as people crawling out of a shell, others that bring forth birds, men and women, white and blacks doing all sorts of different activities and poses." [...] Because the triptych was publicly displayed in the palace of the House of Nassau, it was visible to many, and Bosch's reputation and fame quickly spread across Europe. The work's popularity can be measured by the numerous surviving copiesin oil, engraving and tapestrycommissioned by wealthy patrons, {{as well as by the}} number of forgeries in circulation after his death. Most are of the central panel only and do not deviate from the original. These copies were usually painted on a much smaller scale, and they vary considerably in quality. Many were created a generation after Bosch, and some took the form of wall tapestries.|$|E
