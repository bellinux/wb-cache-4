5|$|Among the actinides, thorium and uranium are {{the easiest}} to isolate. Thorium is {{extracted}} mostly from monazite: thorium pyrophosphate (ThP2O7) is reacted with nitric acid, and the produced thorium nitrate treated with <b>tributyl</b> <b>phosphate.</b> Rare-earth impurities are separated by increasing the pH in sulfate solution.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} use for phosphoryl chloride {{is in the}} manufacture of triarylphosphate esters (as described above) such as triphenyl phosphate and tricresyl phosphate. These esters have been used for many years as flame retardants and plasticisers for PVC. Meanwhile, trialkyl esters such as <b>tributyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> (made similarly from n-butanol) are used as liquid–liquid extraction solvents in nuclear reprocessing and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Uranium is {{extracted}} from its ores in various ways. In one method, the ore is burned and then reacted with nitric acid to convert uranium into a dissolved state. Treating the solution {{with a solution}} of <b>tributyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> (TBP) in kerosene transforms uranium into an organic form UO2(NO3)2(TBP)2. The insoluble impurities are filtered and the uranium {{is extracted}} by reaction with hydroxides as (NH4)2U2O7 or with hydrogen peroxide as UO4·2H2O.|$|E
5|$|High thorium {{concentrations}} {{are needed}} in nuclear applications; particularly, concentrations of atoms with high neutron capture cross-sections must be very low (for example, gadolinium concentrations must be lower than one part per million by weight). Previously, repeated dissolution and recrystallisation was used to achieve high purity. Today, liquid solvent extraction procedures involving selective complexation of Th4+ is used. For example, following alkaline digestion {{and the removal of}} phosphate, the resulting nitrato complexes of thorium, uranium, and the rare earths can be separated by extraction with <b>tributyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> in kerosene.|$|E
5|$|Most {{methods that}} {{separate}} neptunium ions exploit the differing chemical behaviour of the differing oxidation states of neptunium (from +3 to +6 or sometimes even +7) in solution. Among the methods that are {{or have been}} used are: solvent extraction (using various extractants, usually multidentate β-diketone derivatives, organophosphorus compounds, and amine compounds), chromatography using various ion-exchange or chelating resins, coprecipitation (possible matrices include LaF3, BiPO4, BaSO4, Fe(OH)3, and MnO2), electrodeposition, and biotechnological methods. Currently, commercial reprocessing plants use the Purex process, involving the solvent extraction of uranium and plutonium with <b>tributyl</b> <b>phosphate.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most {{synthesis}} routines yield {{a mixture}} of different actinide isotopes as oxides, from which a certain isotope of curium needs to be separated. An example procedure could be to dissolve spent reactor fuel (e.g. MOX fuel) in nitric acid, and remove {{the bulk of the}} uranium and plutonium using a PUREX (Plutonium – URanium EXtraction) type extraction with <b>tributyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> in a hydrocarbon. The lanthanides and the remaining actinides are then separated from the aqueous residue (raffinate) by a diamide-based extraction to give, after stripping, {{a mixture of}} trivalent actinides and lanthanides. A curium compound is then selectively extracted using multi-step chromatographic and centrifugation techniques with an appropriate reagent. Bis-triazinyl bipyridine complex has been recently proposed as such reagent which is highly selective to curium. Separation of curium from a very similar americium can also be achieved by treating a slurry of their hydroxides in aqueous sodium bicarbonate with ozone at elevated temperature. Both americium and curium are present in solutions mostly in the +3 valence state; whereas americium oxidizes to soluble Am(IV) complexes, curium remains unchanged and can thus be isolated by repeated centrifugation.|$|E
25|$|Uranium {{trioxide}} can be {{dissolved in}} a mixture of <b>tributyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> and thenoyltrifluoroacetone in supercritical carbon dioxide, ultrasound was employed during the dissolution.|$|E
500|$|In another method, Pu4+ and [...] {{are first}} {{extracted}} with <b>tributyl</b> <b>phosphate,</b> then reacted with hydrazine washing out the recovered plutonium.|$|E
500|$|The {{fact that}} {{berkelium}} readily assumes oxidation state +4 in solids, and is relatively stable {{in this state}} in liquids greatly assists separation of berkelium away from many other actinides. These are inevitably produced in relatively large amounts during the nuclear synthesis and often favor the +3 state. This fact was not yet known in the initial experiments, which used a more complex separation procedure. Various oxidation agents {{can be applied to}} the berkelium(III) solutions to convert it to the +4 state, such as bromates (...) , bismuthates (...) , chromates ( [...] and CrO), silver(I) thiolate (...) , lead(IV) oxide (...) , ozone (...) , or photochemical oxidation procedures. Berkelium(IV) is then extracted with ion exchange, extraction chromatography or liquid-liquid extraction using HDEHP (bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric scid), amines, <b>tributyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> or various other reagents. These procedures separate berkelium from most trivalent actinides and lanthanides, except for the lanthanide cerium (lanthanides are absent in the irradiation target but are created in various nuclear fission decay chains).|$|E
500|$|Praseodymium {{may then}} be {{separated}} from the other lanthanides via ion-exchange chromatography, or by using a solvent such as <b>tributyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> where the solubility of Ln3+ increases as the atomic number increases. If ion-exchange chromatography is used, the mixture of lanthanides is loaded into one column of cation-exchange resin and Cu2+ or Zn2+ or Fe3+ is loaded into the other. An aqueous solution of a complexing agent, known as the eluant (usually triammonium edtate), is passed through the columns, and Ln3+ is displaced from the first column and redeposited in a compact band {{at the top of the}} column before being re-displaced by [...] The Gibbs free energy of formation for Ln(edta·H) complexes increases along the lanthanides by about one quarter from Ce3+ to Lu3+, so that the Ln3+ cations descend the development column in a band and are fractionated repeatedly, eluting from heaviest to lightest. They are then precipitated as their insoluble oxalates, burned to form the oxides, and then reduced to the metals.|$|E
500|$|Most {{synthesis}} routines yield {{a mixture}} of different actinide isotopes in oxide forms, from which isotopes of americium can be separated. In a typical procedure, the spent reactor fuel (e.g. MOX fuel) is dissolved in nitric acid, and the bulk of uranium and plutonium is removed using a PUREX-type extraction (Plutonium–URanium EXtraction) with <b>tributyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> in a hydrocarbon. The lanthanides and remaining actinides are then separated from the aqueous residue (raffinate) by a diamide-based extraction, to give, after stripping, {{a mixture of}} trivalent actinides and lanthanides. Americium compounds are then selectively extracted using multi-step chromatographic and centrifugation techniques with an appropriate reagent. A large amount of {{work has been done}} on the solvent extraction of americium. For example, a 2003 EU-funded project codenamed [...] "EUROPART" [...] studied triazines and other compounds as potential extraction agents. A bis-triazinyl bipyridine complex was proposed in 2009 as such a reagent is highly selective to americium (and curium). Separation of americium from the highly similar curium can be achieved by treating a slurry of their hydroxides in aqueous sodium bicarbonate with ozone, at elevated temperatures. Both Am and Cm are mostly present in solutions in the +3 valence state; whereas curium remains unchanged, americium oxidizes to soluble Am(IV) complexes which can be washed away.|$|E
2500|$|In 1964 the Magnox {{reprocessing}} plant came on stream to reprocess {{spent nuclear fuel}} from the Magnox reactors. The plant uses the [...] "plutonium uranium extraction" [...] Purex method for reprocessing spent fuel, with <b>tributyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> as an extraction agent. The Purex process produces uranium, plutonium and fission products as output streams. Over the 30 years from 1971 to 2001 the Magnox Reprocessing Plant has reprocessed over 35,000 tonnes of Magnox fuel, with 15,000 tonnes of fuel being regenerated. Magnox fuel is reprocessed since it corrodes if stored underwater, and routes for dry storage {{have not yet been}} proven.|$|E

50|$|A 15-40% (usually about 30%) {{solution}} of <b>tributyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> in kerosene or dodecane {{is used in}} the liquid-liquid extraction (solvent extraction) of uranium, plutonium, and thorium from spent uranium nuclear fuel rods dissolved in nitric acid, as part of a nuclear reprocessing process known as PUREX.|$|E
50|$|Two PUREX {{raffinate}}s exist. The {{most highly}} active raffinate {{from the first}} cycle is the one which is most commonly known as PUREX raffinate. The other is from the medium-active cycle in which the uranium and plutonium are refined by a second extraction with <b>tributyl</b> <b>phosphate.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Sequestrants and {{chelating}} agents {{are used to}} [...] "disarm" [...] metal ions present in the solution, which could otherwise reduce the efficiency of other components, and assist with cleaning stains, which often contain metal compounds. The most common sequestrants used in paint strippers are EDTA, <b>tributyl</b> <b>phosphate,</b> and sodium phosphate.|$|E
5000|$|The PUREX {{process was}} invented by Herbert H. Anderson and Larned B. Asprey at the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago, {{as part of the}} Manhattan Project under Glenn T. Seaborg; their patent [...] "Solvent Extraction Process for Plutonium" [...] filed in 1947, {{mentions}} <b>tributyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> as the major reactant which accomplishes the bulk of the chemical extraction.|$|E
50|$|The very {{short-lived}} isotopes such as 140Ba and 131I {{were absent}} from this mixture, and the long-lived 137Cs was {{only at a}} small concentration. This is {{because it is not}} able to enter the tributyl phosphate/hydrocarbon organic phase used in the first liquid-liquid extraction cycle of the PUREX process. The second cycle is normally to clean up the uranium and plutonium product. In the PUREX process some zirconium, technetium, and other elements are extracted by the <b>tributyl</b> <b>phosphate.</b> Due to the radiation induced degradation of <b>tributyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> the first cycle organic phase is always contaminated with ruthenium (later extracted by dibutyl hydrogen phosphate). Because the very short-lived radioisotopes and the relatively long-lived caesium isotopes are either absent or in low concentrations the shape of the dose rate vs. time graph is different from Chernobyl both for short times and long times after the accident.|$|E
50|$|B205 is {{the name}} of the Magnox nuclear {{reprocessing}} plant at Sellafield in northern England. This plant uses PUREX chemistry (based on <b>tributyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> (TBP)) to extract plutonium and uranium from used nuclear fuel. The plant was originally constructed and operated by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), but in 1971 control was transferred to British Nuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL).|$|E
50|$|One {{term for}} the third phase found in PUREX plants is crud (Chalk River Unknown Deposit). One common crud is formed by the {{reaction}} of zirconium salts (from fission) with degraded <b>tributyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> (TBP). The TBP degrades into dibutyl hydrogen phosphate and then into butyl dihydrogen phosphate. The dibutyl hydrogen phosphate and the zirconium can form polymeric solid which is very insoluble.|$|E
50|$|The {{shipment}} of 20 tons of <b>tributyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> to North Korea from China in 2002, {{coinciding with the}} resumption of activity at Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center, was seen by the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency as cause for concern; that amount was considered sufficient to extract enough material for perhaps three to five potential nuclear weapons.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} use for phosphoryl chloride {{is in the}} manufacture of triarylphosphate esters (as described above) such as triphenyl phosphate and tricresyl phosphate.

50|$|Liquid-liquid {{extraction}} of chloroauric acid {{is used for}} the recovery, concentrating, purification, and analytical determinations of gold. Of great importance is the {{extraction of}} HAuCl4 from hydrochloric medium by oxygen-containing extractants, such as alcohols, ketones, ethers and esters. The concentration of gold(III) in the extracts may exceed 1 mol/L. The most frequently used extractants for this purpose are dibutyl glycol, methyl isobutyl ketone, <b>tributyl</b> <b>phosphate,</b> dichlorodiethyl ether (chlorex).|$|E
50|$|Uranium is {{extracted}} from its ores in various ways. In one method, the ore is burned and then reacted with nitric acid to convert uranium into a dissolved state.

50|$|The {{solubility}} of plutonyl nitrate {{in organic}} solvents is utilized in the PUREX process. Plutonyl nitrate is extracted with <b>tributyl</b> <b>phosphate,</b> (CH3CH2CH2CH2O)3PO, TBP, as the preferred second ligand, and kerosene the preferred organic solvent. It is recovered by treatment with aqueous ferrous sulfamate which selectively reduces the plutonium to the +3 oxidation {{state in the}} aqueous solution, leaving the uranium in the organic phase. Plutonyl complex chemistry is an active research area, for dealing with environmental contamination.|$|E
5000|$|The {{extractive}} {{capabilities of}} DEHPA {{can be increased}} through synergistic effects {{by the addition of}} other organophosphorus compounds. <b>Tributyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> is often used, as well as dibutyl-, diamyl-, and dihexylphosphonates. The synergistic effects are thought to occur by the addition of the trialkylphosphate to the uranyl-DEHPA complex by hydrogen bonding. The synergistic additive may also react with the DEHPA, competing with the uranyl extraction, resulting in a decrease in extraction efficiency past a concentration specific to the compound.|$|E
