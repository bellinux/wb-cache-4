25|$|On 16 February 1943, the Service du Travail Obligatoire (STO) {{organisation}} was created, {{requiring the}} call up of able-bodied French men {{to work in}} Germany. In the Reich, with so many men had been called up for service with the Wehrmacht and the very sexist Nazi regime reluctant to have German women work in factories as Hitler believed working damaged a woman's womb, so throughout the war the German state had a policy of bringing foreign workers to Germany to replace the men serving in the Wehrmacht. Reports had reached France (which were true) that at the Dora works near the Buchenwald concentration camp, about 10,000 slave workers, mostly French and Russian, had to work on building V2 rockets in a vast subterranean factory in living quarters meant to house only 2, 500 people, were allowed to sleep only four and half hours every night and were regularly brutalized by the guards. The chief pleasure of the slaves, both French and Russian, at the Dora works was urinating on the machinery when the guards were not looking. The underground press gave much coverage to the conditions at the Dora works, pointed out those Frenchmen who {{went to work in}} Germany were not paid the generous wages promised by the Organisation Todt and instead were turned into slaves, all of which the underground papers used as reasons for why the French should not go to work in Germany. Under the law of 16 February 1943 all able-bodied Frenchmen aged 20–22 who were not miners, farmers and university students had to report to the STO <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>two</b> years labour in Germany. As the occupation went on, service with the STO was widened with farmers and university students losing their exempt status until the point in 1944 was reached that all fit men aged 18–60 and women aged 18–45 were being called up for service with the STO. Men over 45 and all women serving in the STO were guaranteed not to go to Germany and many were called up with the STO were put to work building the Atlantic Wall for the Organisation Todt, but those called up with the STO {{had no way of knowing}} where they would go when they entered the ranks of the STO. The so-called réfractaires attempted to avoid being called up for the STO and often went into hiding rather work in the Reich. At least 40,000 Frenchmen (80% of the resistance were people under the age of thirty) fled to the countryside, becoming the core of the maquis guerrillas. Those who fled into the countryside rejected the term réfractaire with its connotations of laziness and called themselves the maquis, which originated as Corsican Italian slang for bandits, whose root word was macchia, which was the term for the scrubland and forests of Corsica. Those who lived in the macchia of Corsica were usually bandits, and those men fleeing to the countryside chose the term maquis as a more romantic and defiant term than réfractaire. By June 1943, the term maquis which had been a little known word borrowed from the Corsican dialect of Italian at the beginning of 1943 become widely known all over France. It was only in 1943 that guerilla warfare emerged in France as opposed to the more sporadic attacks against the Germans that had been going since the summer of 1941 and the resistance changed from an urban movement to a rural movement that was most active in central and southern France.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the success}} of GoldenEye in {{reviving}} the Bond series, there was pressure to recreate that success in the film's follow-up production.

500|$|Following the Boer War {{there were}} {{calls for the}} disbandment of the cavalry by such notable persons as the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces Lord Roberts and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Between 1900 and 1903 the cavalry's share of the army budget was cut from six to under 4.5 per cent, and {{recruiting}} for the cavalry was suspended for a year. Added to this, the Commonwealth Defence Act 1903 proposed a force of nine brigades formed by a militia, with six of the brigades planned to be mounted infantry known as light horse. In the same year, Lord Roberts appointed Robert Baden-Powell of the 5th Dragoon Guards {{to the position of}} Inspector General of Cavalry, a surprising choice as Roberts had earlier described him as being [...] "certainly not a General". Within the year, Baden-Powell was endorsing a change in policy, recommending that instead of countering an enemy charge with a countercharge of their own, the cavalry should dismount and engage them with rifle fire. For cavalry to survive, by necessity British cavalry doctrine had to change, as the emphasis was now on dismounted firepower and cavalry charges that were supported by covering fire from the flanks, by their own machine guns, and the guns of the Royal Horse Artillery (RHA). To support this change in policy, cavalrymen were now required <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>two</b> hours rifle or sword practice a day. This made them just as proficient as the infantry with their rifles. In 1908 one regiment, the 14th Hussars, recorded having 354 marksmen, 212 first class shots, thirty-five second class, and only four third class shots.|$|E
500|$|In The Daily Telegraph Christopher Howse {{concentrated}} on the moral arguments in the book, and agreed with Hitchens that [...] "to determine {{what is right and}} what is wrong without God, is difficult". [...] Also in The Daily Telegraph, Charles Moore wrote that the book [...] "tries <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>two</b> things at once. One is to bash up modern militant atheism with all the author's polemical skill. The other is to give an autobiographical account of how, in our time, an intelligent man's faith may recover". In a positive review in Standpoint magazine, Michael Nazir Ali wrote, [...] "One of the abiding canards nailed by Peter Hitchens is that religion causes conflict. He does this by showing that so-called [...] "religious" [...] wars had many other elements to them, such as greed for territory, political ambition and nationalism. His repeated references to Soviet brutality reveal that secular ideologies have caused more suffering in recent times than any conflict associated with religion." [...] In a more critical review in the New Statesman Sholto Byrnes wrote, [...] "Hitchens makes his case forcefully, passionately and intelligently", but [...] "makes too much connection between the ill deeds of atheists and their atheism". Byrnes also reviewed the book in The Independent, where he questioned the validity of a number of Hitchens's conclusions, including that [...] "atheists 'actively wish for disorder and meaninglessness'". In a sympathetic review in The Guardian, Rupert Shortt wrote, [...] "Hitchens does not seek to mount a comprehensive defence of Christianity. He is wise to avoid deeper philosophical and theological waters, because his strengths lie elsewhere. His more manageable aim is to expose what he holds to be three major fallacies underlying God Is Not Great: that conflict fought in the name of religion is really always about faith; that [...] "it is ultimately possible to know with confidence what is right and what is wrong without acknowledging the existence of God"; and that [...] "atheist states are not actually atheist". In The Spectator, Quentin Letts reviewed the book very positively, describing it as [...] "a magnificent, sustained cry against the aggressive secularism taking control of our weakened culture".|$|E

Although he was delighted to get pole position, he felt he lost time in the middle sector after making a mistake. Vettel's teammate Webber was also the front row of the grid; he recorded a lap time 0.076 seconds slower than Vettel's and was pleased they would start the race alongside each other. Webber was not happy with his first set of option tyres; he chose <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>two</b> more timed laps on a new set of option tyres in the third session. Alonso qualified third; he said his starting position had realised Ferrari's [...] "maximum potential". He also aimed to ensure that he finished the race because rain had been forecast. Alonso had been the fastest driver during most of the third session until Vettel set his pole position lap. Hamilton set the first session's fastest time of 1:37.113; he almost did not challenge for the pole position because he avoided making contact with the wall at the pit lane entry. He fell to fourth overall in the final part of qualifying. In the faster of the two Mercedes, Rosberg secured fifth place; Massa in the slower Ferrari placed sixth. Massa was not happy because he would start the race on the dirty side of the grid, having encountered traffic during the third session. Button complained about the lack of grip and that he could not get his types to the optium temperature; he managed seventh position but was happy to start on the clean side of the grid. Kubica recorded the eighth-fastest time and struggled with oversteer, which prevented him from setting a faster lap time. Schumacher in the slower Mercedes took ninth place ahead of Barrichello in tenth. Barrichello was angry with Schumacher because he had blocked Barrichello during the second qualifying session. Schumacher went to Barrichello to apologise and was subsequently summoned by the stewards, who issued Schumacher with a reprimand.|$|E
500|$|At {{this point}} in the development, the {{backdrop}} of Rapture had been fleshed out, but they had yet to come on how to represent the drones, protectors, and harvesters from their original game idea. The Big Daddy concept as the protector class was developed early in the process, but the team had yet to reach a satisfying design for the drones, having used several possible designs including bugs and dogs in wheelchairs. The team wanted to have the player care for the drones in some way and create pathos for these characters. The idea of using little girls came out of brainstorming, but was controversial and shocking within the team at first, recognizing that they could easily be killed and make the game more horrific in the style of Night Trap. However, as Levine worked on the story, he started to incorporate the ideas of dystopian and utopian thinkers from the twentieth century, including Ayn Rand, Aldous Huxley, and George Orwell, and considered their ideas [...] "fascinating". He brought in the ideas of Objectivism that Rand primarily outlined in the book Atlas Shrugged, that man should be driven by selfishness and not altruism, and used this to inform the philosophy behind the city of Rapture and Andrew Ryan’s work, tied in with his previous observations on Rockefeller and his writings. This was extended {{to the use of the}} little girls as drones (now Little Sisters), particularly the question whether the player should try to save the girls or harvest the ADAM for their own benefit. 2K Games expressed concern about the initial mechanic of the Little Sisters, where the player would actively prey on the Little Sister, which would have alerted a Big Daddy and setting up the fight with the player. This approach did not sit well with Levine, and 2K Games asserted that they would not ship a game [...] "where the player gets punished for doing the right thing". They altered this approach where the Little Sisters would be invulnerable until the player had dealt with their Big Daddy, though LeBreton considered this [...] "a massive kludge" [...] into the game's fiction. The idea of creating the Little Sisters and presenting the player with this choice became a critical part of the game's appeal to the larger gaming market though would still be met with criticism from some outlets. Levine desired only to have one ending to the game, something that would have left the fate of the characters [...] "much more ambiguous", but publisher pressure directed them to craft multiple endings depending on the choice of harvesting Little Sisters. Levine also noted that [...] "it was never my intention <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>two</b> endings for the game. It sort of came very late and it was something that was requested by somebody up the food chain from me." ...|$|E
