25|$|The first {{important}} {{painter of}} this time was the Amasis Painter (560–525 BC), named after the famous potter Amasis, with whom he primarily worked. Many researchers regard them as the same person. He began his painting career {{at about the same}} time as Lydos but was active over a period almost twice as long. Whereas Lydos showed more the abilities of a skilled craftsman, the Amasis Painter was an accomplished artist. His images are clever, charming and sophisticated and his personal artistic development comes close to a reflection of the overall evolution of black-figure Attic vase painting at that time. His early work shows his affinity to the painters of Siana cups. Advances can be most easily recognized in how he draws the folds of clothing. His early female figures wear clothes without folds. Later he paints flat, angular folds, and in the end he is able to convey the impression of supple, flowing garments. Drawings of garments were one of his chief characteristics; he liked to depicted pattered and fringed clothing. The groups of figures which the Amasis Painter shows were carefully drawn and symmetrically composed. Initially they were quite static, later figures convey an impression of motion. Although the Amasis Painter often depicted mythological events—he is known for his pig-faced satyrs, for example—he is better known for his scenes of daily life. He was the first painter to portray them to a significant extent. His work decisively influenced the work of red-figure painters later. He possibly anticipated some of their innovations or was influenced by <b>them</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> end of his painting career: on many of his vases women are only shown in outline, without a black filling, and they are no longer identifiable as women by the application of opaque white as skin color.|$|E

The I Scouting Group and II Scouting Group, along with the Second Torpedo-Boat Flotilla were to attack a heavily guarded British convoy to Norway, {{with the rest of the}} High Seas Fleet steaming in support.

500|$|Other nationalists {{had high}} hopes for the German {{unification}} movement, and the frustration with lasting German unification after 1850 seemed to set the national movement back. Revolutionaries associated national unification with progress. As Giuseppe Garibaldi wrote to German revolutionary Karl Blind on 10 April 1865, [...] "The progress of humanity seems to {{have come to a}} halt, and you with your superior intelligence will know why. The reason is that the world lacks a nation [...] possesses true leadership. Such leadership, of course, is required not to dominate other peoples but to lead them along the path of duty, to lead <b>them</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> brotherhood of nations where all the barriers erected by egoism will be destroyed." [...] Garibaldi looked to Germany for the [...] "kind of leadership , in the true tradition of medieval chivalry, would devote itself to redressing wrongs, supporting the weak, sacrificing momentary gains and material advantage for the much finer and more satisfying achievement of relieving the suffering of our fellow men. We need a nation courageous enough to give us a lead in this direction. It would rally to its cause all those who are suffering wrong or who aspire to a better life and all those who are now enduring foreign oppression." ...|$|E

2500|$|Under {{the most}} widely {{accepted}} scenario, hunters would slowly encircle a bison herd several miles from the jump and subtly drive <b>them</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> base of the hill {{leading up to the}} cliff. It's not known how many hunters this required. Archeologists theorize that anywhere from 12 to 100 people may have participated. Low fences (or [...] "drive lines") of rock and braided vines were built to help funnel the bison toward the summit. These fences extended back at least half a mile from the summit. (About 260 stone piles, remnants of these drive lines, still exist near the hilltop. In 2011, remains of the braided vines were also found at the site.) As the bison began moving toward the summit, hunters (perhaps wearing wolf hides) would leap up from their hiding places behind the rock fences and begin making loud noises. This would begin to stampede the herd, so that they could not stop at the cliff face and would plummet over it to their deaths. There are oral history traditions among some tribes about [...] "buffalo runners" [...] – swift, brave young men who would drape themselves in a buffalo robe and race ahead of the herd to help lead <b>them</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> cliff summit. The young man would leap over the cliff and land on a ledge just out of sight below, while the herd would plummet over and past him.

2500|$|Jacques Numa Sadoul, {{commonly}} known as Captain Sadoul ( [...] , Zhak Sadul; May 22, 1881 – November 18, 1956), was a French lawyer, communist politician, and writer, {{one of the founders}} of the Communist International. He began his career in the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) in Vienne, and, by the time of World War I, was serving under Albert Thomas, the Minister of Armaments.

2500|$|One of the {{greatest}} threats {{to the survival of}} hatchlings is artificial lighting. [...] When a sea turtle hatches, its evolutionary instincts push it to move towards the brightest light in view, which naturally would be the sun or the moon, leading <b>them</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> ocean horizon and into their new ecosystem. However, due to the continual expansion of cities, construction of condos and hotels on coasts everywhere has grown exponentially. [...] With the invention of the light bulb and therefore artificial light, the sea turtle’s natural source of guiding light has been replaced and is no longer the only or the brightest [...] thing of light. [...] With virtually every coast in Mexico now constantly lit with buildings, the hatchlings become easily confused and turned around, few of them making successful treks to the ocean. Studies support artificial light as the leading cause for hatchling disorientation, showing that in 1999, 51% of the nests studied showed signs of confusion with one-fourth of all the hatchlings headed in the wrong direction.|$|E

The ethnocentrism of the passionate folk of Majorca, however, was nourished by the anti-Semitic Ferdinand of Aragon (1412–16), who issued a decree against the Jews (March 20, 1413), by which they were compelled to dwell exclusively in the Jewish quarter, and were forbidden to eat or drink with Christians; to employ Christian nurses or other servants; to attend Christian marriages or funerals; to adopt the title [...] "Don"; to hold any public office; to carry weapons, such as swords or daggers; to use any costly material for their clothes; to wear silk, fur, or any ornaments; to sell any foodstuffs to Christians; to make them gifts of pastry, meats, or drinks; to be physicians to them, or to give them any medicine. Moreover, they had to wear the badge that marked the Jew. Christian women, whether married or unmarried, and courtesans, were strictly prohibited from visiting the Jews' quarter by day or night. Jews who wished to be baptized {{were not to be}} deterred by any one from their resolve; and the officers of the king were ordered to prevent Jewish women converted to Christianity from emigrating to Africa, since they reverted to Judaism when there and sent for their children to follow <b>them.</b> <b>Toward</b> <b>the</b> end of August, 1415, Vincente Ferrer came to Majorca to convert the Jews, and pursued this work for nearly six months.|$|E
