25|$|A CD is read by {{focusing}} a 780nm wavelength (near infrared) semiconductor laser housed within <b>the</b> <b>CD</b> <b>player,</b> through {{the bottom of}} the polycarbonate layer. The change in height between pits and lands results in a difference in the way the light is reflected. By measuring the intensity change with a photodiode, the data can be read from the disc. In order to accommodate the spiral pattern of data, the semiconductor laser is placed on a swing arm within the disc tray of any CD player. This swing arm allows the laser to read information from the centre {{to the edge of a}} disc, without having to interrupt the spinning of the disc itself.|$|E
25|$|Another {{method of}} manual {{calibration}} requires {{a pair of}} high-quality headphones patched into the input signal before any processing (such as the pre-fade-listen of the test program input channel of the mixing console, or the headphone output of <b>the</b> <b>CD</b> <b>player</b> or tape deck). One can then use this direct signal as a near-perfect reference with which to find any differences in frequency response. This method may not be perfect, {{but it can be}} very helpful with limited resources or time, such as using pre-show music to correct for the changes in response caused by the arrival of a crowd. Because this is still a very subjective method of calibration, and because the human ear is so dynamic in its own response, the program material used for testing should be as similar as possible to that for which the system is being used.|$|E
25|$|Applications for car stereos varied widely. Auto {{manufacturers}} in the U.S. typically would fit a cassette slot into their standard large radio faceplates. Europe and Asia would standardize on DIN and double DIN sized faceplates. In the 1980s, a high-end installation {{would have a}} Dolby AM/FM cassette deck, and they rendered the 8-track cartridge obsolete in car installations because of space, performance, and audio quality. In the 1990s and 2000s, {{as the cost of}} building CD players declined, many manufacturers offered a CD player. <b>The</b> <b>CD</b> <b>player</b> eventually supplanted the cassette deck as standard equipment, but some cars, especially those targeted at older drivers, were offered with the option of a cassette player, either by itself or sometimes in combination with a CD slot. Most new cars can still accommodate aftermarket cassette players, and the auxiliary jack advertised for MP3 players can be used also with portable cassette players, but 2011 was the first model year for which no manufacturer offered factory-installed cassette players.|$|E

500|$|Writing in Rolling Stone in 2002, Greg Kot {{found the}} album [...] "drearily monochromatic" [...] {{compared}} to its predecessor, and to PopMatters' Zeth Lundy, it suffers from [...] "a more anonymous tract" [...] {{next to the}} [...] "cathedral-grade significance" [...] of All Things Must Pass. Reviewing Harrison's solo career for Goldmine magazine in 2002, Dave Thompson considered the 1973 album to be the equal of All Things Must Pass, reasoning: [...] "While history insists that Living in the Material World {{could not help but}} be eclipsed by its gargantuan forebear, with the two albums in <b>the</b> <b>CD</b> <b>player</b> and the 'shuffle' function mixing them up, it's difficult to play favourites." ...|$|E

The sequence ends when the button of an electronic key fob is pressed, closing the hatchback of a fully [...] assembled Honda Accord on a carefully balanced trailer.

500|$|After {{finishing}} Springsteen's Born in the U.S.A. tour, Jackson {{expressed his}} ideas about possible improvements to digital audio {{in a conversation}} with Christof Heidelberger, a designer of digital audio electronics, and Betty Bennett, the president of Soundcraft's U.S. division. Jackson, Bennett and Heidelberger formed Apogee Electronics in December 1985 (announced in the 23 November issue of Billboard) and started investigating 44kHz digital audio circuits for audible problems. They found that [...] "textbook filters" [...] which were unnecessarily steep were protecting <b>the</b> <b>CD</b> <b>player</b> output from high levels of 20kHz signals, an exceedingly unlikely occurrence in music. Jackson determined that Apogee could improve the sound of CDs if the low-pass filters used in the recording process were made less steep, for less phase shift throughout the hearing range. The small company produced better anti-aliasing filters for recording equipment. Initially operating out of his garage, Jackson served as the company's owner and president, and his third wife Bennett headed up sales. They demonstrated their first product at the Audio Engineering Society's 81st convention held in Los Angeles in November 1986: the 944 Series low-dispersion, linear phase, active low-pass filter, intended to replace existing filters on multi-track digital tape recorders such as the Sony PCM-3324. After a slow start, the firm sold 30,000 of the filters: [...] "a great success." [...] The 944 earned a TEC Award in 1988, the first of many such awards for Apogee.|$|E

2500|$|Cassettes {{remained}} {{popular for}} specific applications, such as car audio and telephone answering machines, {{well into the}} 1990s.

However, the advent of [...] "shock proof" [...] buffering technology in CD players, the general heightening of consumer expectations, {{and the introduction of}} CD auto-changers meant that, by the early 2000s, <b>the</b> <b>CD</b> <b>player</b> rapidly replaced the cassette player as the default audio component in the majority of new vehicles in Europe and America.

2500|$|Decoding: <b>The</b> <b>CD</b> <b>player</b> (CIRC decoder) {{receives}} the 32 output symbol data stream. [...] This stream {{passes through the}} decoder D1 first. It is up to individual designers of CD systems to decide on decoding methods and optimize their product performance. [...] Being of minimum distance 5 The D1,D2 decoders can each correct a combination of [...] errors and [...] erasures such that [...] In most decoding solutions, D1 is designed to correct single error. And in case of more than 1 error, this decoder outputs 28 erasures. The deinterlever at the succeeding stage distributes these erasures across 28 D2 codewords. Again in most solutions, D2 is set to deal with erasures only (a simpler and less expensive solution). If more than 4 erasures were to be encountered, 24 erasures are output by D2. Thereafter, an error concealment system attempts to interpolate (from neighboring symbols) in case of uncorrectable symbols, failing which sounds corresponding to such erroneous symbols get muted.|$|E

30|$|Consequently, the {{representative}} task design process to assess tactical expertise {{can be summarized}} with four premises {{from the perspective of}} dynamical ecology (Brunswik 1956; Davids et al. 2006): (a) the player must be provided with both primary and secondary constraints (Renshaw et al. 2009), and there should be no unilateral assessment of behavioral factors (mind, body, and context); (b) the primacy of perception must be recognized, ensuring assessment situations in which perceptual systems are selecting relevant information for <b>the</b> movement; (<b>c)</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> must be provided with situations that allow them to adapt their behaviors to the context dynamics (tactical problems), allowing complex interactions between perceptions, intentions and actions; (d) the emergence of adaptive behavior must be facilitated by ensuring that players experience motor problems with ecological links between information and movement. An applied example of this approach is presented in the following section: the evaluation-games design strategy based on the tactical problems of invasion games.|$|R

This technique—also used on the cello—is called thumb position. While playing in thumb position, few players use the fourth (little) finger, as it is usually too weak to produce reliable tone (this is also true for cellists), although some extreme chords or extended techniques, especially in contemporary music, may require its use.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We propose axiomatizing some {{stochastic}} games, in {{a continuous}} state space setting, using continuous belief functions, resp. plausibilities, instead of measures. Then, stochastic games are just variations on continuous Markov chains. We argue that drawing at random along a belief function {{is the same as}} letting the probabilistic player P play first, then letting <b>the</b> non-deterministic <b>player</b> <b>C</b> play demonically. <b>The</b> same holds for an angelic C, using plausibilities instead. We then define a simple modal logic, and characterize simulation in terms of formulae of this logic. Finally, we show that (discounted) payoffs are defined and unique, where in the demonic case, P maximizes payoff, while C minimizes it. ...|$|R

40|$|This study uses a {{case study}} of the Victorian Football League's {{expansion}} into Brisbane to examine the interorganisational power between an independent federated network and those organisations seeking to join the federation. Data were obtained through interviews with participants in the expansion process, examination of newspaper and other print media articles, and the analysis of corporate documentation. Organisations within the federation are shown to have a power advantage over the potential affiliates. The extent of this advantage is directly proportional to the importance of the potential affiliate's goals, is mediated by resources controlled by the federation, and is inversely proportional to the availability of other federations to supply the potential affiliate with the same resources. The VFL's exercise of its power is reflected in (a) a licence fee significantly higher than originally anticipated by the new affiliate, (b) an upfront cash payment of <b>the</b> licence fee, (<b>c)</b> <b>player</b> recruitment guidelines that did not facilitate recruitment of established VFL players, and (d) an insufficient period of time between award of the licence and the new team's entry into VFL competition. ...|$|R
