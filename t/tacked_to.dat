25|$|However, as crinolines {{started to}} develop in fashion, sleeves turned to be like large bells which gave the dress a heavier volume. Engageantes, which were usually made of lace, linen, or lawn, with cambric and broderie anglaise, were worn under the sleeves. They were easy to remove, launder and {{restitch}} into position, so to act as false sleeves, which was <b>tacked</b> <b>to</b> the elbow-length sleeves during the time.

25|$|The {{remaining}} Britons boarded while shouting various phrases, Arab <b>tacked</b> <b>to</b> try {{to bring}} her starboard guns into battle but she was boarded before achieving this and so her commander ran her aground on the riverbank. Racer and Lynx were quickly taken, their crews surrendered as the British climbed on deck, others jumped over the side and escaped capture. When Polkinghorne went for Dolphin, Captain Stafford put up a stubborn fight and it reportedly took fifteen minutes to secure the vessel. Five Americans were wounded before Dolphin struck her colors and ended the battle, though casualties from the other privateers amounted to six killed and five more wounded. By the time the fighting was over the remaining British boats arrived and assisted in taking over 100 prisoners.|$|E
25|$|Cornelia calls Dr. Wells back to {{the house}} to examine Richard's body. Dale asks Wells to hide the {{blueprint}} she took from Richard, because the others might think that she killed him for it. Reginald Beresford, a lawyer waiting in his car after he drove Richard to the house, comes inside. Reginald recognizes Jack, and the exposure of her fiancé makes Dale admit that she gave Wells the blueprint with the hidden room. Wells claims that he does not have the blueprint; Cornelia reveals other evidence incriminating him, and Anderson asks to question him alone. Wells knocks Anderson unconscious during the interrogation and drags him into another room. Before Wells can go to the hidden room, a stranger claiming to have lost his memory after he was attacked and tied up in the garage appears at the terrace door. When the guests try to identify the unknown man, they discover that they have been locked in the house.

60|$|Our ship behaved well on this occasion, {{getting out}} of the way with {{sufficient}} rapidity. While this was in the course of execution, I had an opportunity to look after the corvette and the lugger. The last was still leading, having managed, by means of short <b>tacks,</b> <b>to</b> work up considerably to windward of the two French frigates. Here she had made a last <b>tack</b> <b>to</b> the eastward, intending to run for the coast. The sloop-of-war was still in her wake, and was following on her heels, at a rapid rate.|$|R
50|$|Some boats even carry two code zeros, usually {{referred}} to as the masthead zero (MH0) and the fractional zero (FR0). The luff of the masthead zero will run from the <b>tack</b> <b>to</b> the top of the mast. The luff of the fractional zero will run from the <b>tack</b> <b>to</b> the top of the forestay on a boat that is a fractional rig. This means that the FRO is usually smaller than the MHO. Sailors will often pronounce MHO as 'mo', like the slang for a mohawk and the FRO as 'fro' like the slang for an afro haircut.|$|R

500|$|The sod {{house was}} not without its disadvantages, however. [...] Initially, at least, most had dirt floors, {{which had to be}} {{sprinkled}} with water to abate dust. [...] To protect against invasion by rodents, insects, and snakes, the interior walls were often shaved smooth and plastered with lime, or with a mixture of local clay and sand or ashes; the lower portions of the exterior walls could also be reinforced, with planks or concrete if they were available, or with a second layer of sod to thicken them. [...] Leaky roofs were also a problem; to protect the inhabitants and the interior furnishings from falling water, dirt, and vermin, it was common to make a ceiling of a white muslin sheet <b>tacked</b> <b>to</b> the walls. [...] Since windows were {{one of the most expensive}} elements of a sod house, pioneers on a budget were often forced to make do with windows that were small and few in number; a light muslin ceiling and plastered walls helped to illuminate the house by reflecting daylight through the interior.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{concept for}} the episode was a one line concept card stating [...] "Lightning Boy" [...] {{that had been}} <b>tacked</b> <b>to</b> a board in series creator Chris Carter's office since the first season. Carter's idea was solely about a boy who could control lightning, and the concept wasn't fleshed out into an episode until the third season. Writer Howard Gordon stated that the key moment in the episode's conception came {{when he decided to}} use the boy's power as a metaphor for disenfranchised adolescence. Gordon described the episode's concept as [...] "Beavis and Butt-head electrified". Gordon claimed that the episode suffered conceptually having come directly after a trilogy of mythology episodes. Story editor Frank Spotnitz claims that there were originally ideas on incorporating some of the events from that trilogy into this episode, but those ideas were eventually scrapped due to the producer's desire for each episode {{to be able to have}} its own integrity and stand alone. Spotnitz said the episode was a risky one to do for a show with an adult audience due to the high school setting and the fact that the episode was about adolescence and violent impulses when one is a kid.|$|E

500|$|The Channel Fleet {{played an}} {{important}} role in the closing stages of the Atlantic campaign of May 1794, when Howe moved out into the Atlantic in the hope of intercepting an approaching French convoy under Admiral Pierre Jean Van Stabel. The main French battlefleet was also known to be at sea, under Admiral Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse. Howe sent Pasley, recently promoted to rear-admiral, and his flying squadron, consisting of Bellerophon and the 74-gun ships , [...] and , ahead to scout for French forces. At 6 am on 28 May the attached frigate [...] signalled Bellerophon to report a sighting of a strange fleet. Pasley took the squadron south-east to investigate, coming in sight of a large fleet at 9 am, and counting thirty-three ships, of which at least twenty-three appeared to be ships of the line. They were confirmed as French by noon, and Pasley signalled this news back to Howe. Howe ordered a pursuit, and by evening the leading British ships, with Pasley's flying squadron forming the van, came in contact with the rear-most French. Bellerophon was the first ship to come into action, when the 110-gun Révolutionnaire dropped back to block her approach. Pasley <b>tacked</b> <b>to</b> close the French ship and began exchanging broadsides. [...] The heavy fire of the larger French ship caused considerable damage, particularly to Bellerophons main topmast, and she fought alone until the remainder of the flying squadron and two ships from the main fleet, [...] and , arrived to assist her. The damaged Bellerophon then drifted clear of the action, and as night fell Howe signalled for the fleet to reform in line ahead and wait for morning before resuming the engagement.|$|E
