A Roman mother's {{right to own}} property and to dispose of it as she saw fit, including setting the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own will, gave her enormous influence over her sons even when they were adults.|$|E
5|$|A fourth {{trial in}} the death of James Kinne was {{scheduled}} for October 1964; however, in September 1964, Kinne, still free on her $25,000 bond, traveled to Mexico with an alleged lover, Francis Samuel Puglise leaving her children with James Kinne's father and traveling as Pugliese's wife under the name Jeanette Pugliese. The couple later said that they had come to Mexico to get married. Under the legal <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> bail, Kinne was permitted to leave the country, but her contract with the company that posted her bond prohibited her from leaving Missouri without written permission from the company's agents. After crossing the border, the couple registered at a local hotel, Hotel Gin, again as husband and wife. Kinne, saying that she felt unsafe in the foreign country, bought a pistol—which meant that the couple now possessed multiple guns, having brought one or two with them from the United States.|$|E
5|$|Camille and {{executive}} producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner eventually convinced Cosby that the series should feature {{a family that}} resembled their own more closely, specifically one headed {{by a pair of}} successful parents with white-collar professions. Thus, Cosby relented and re-wrote Clair and Cliff into a lawyer and doctor, respectively. The idea of Clair being Dominican was abandoned before the pilot was filmed. However, the character still speaks some Spanish in the first episode and continues to speak the language periodically throughout the series, albeit not as frequently as Cosby had originally intended. Cosby borrowed several names from his real-life family for his fictional one; Clair's maiden name is Hanks, which she shares with Camille. The second season explores each character gaining more responsibility, none more-so than Clair, who is deliberately provided with more storylines to experience and new emotions to expess in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> relationship with her husband and children.|$|E

5|$|Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) is an {{executive}} {{editor in chief}} of a book publishing company. After learning she is about to be deported to Canada because she violated the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> work visa, she persuades her assistant, Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds), to marry her. She reminds Andrew that if she's deported, the work he put in as her assistant will be lost, and he'll be set back in his dream to become an editor. Mr. Gilbertson, a U.S. immigration agent, informs them that he suspects they are committing fraud to avoid Margaret's deportation. Gilbertson tells them that they'll be asked questions about each other separately. If their answers don't match, Margaret will be deported to Canada permanently and Andrew will be convicted of a felony punishable by a $250,000 fine and five years in prison. Andrew insists that Margaret make him an editor after their marriage and publish the book he's been recommending to her. Margaret agrees.|$|E

Letourneau was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in state prison for violating the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> probation.|$|E
25|$|Other {{religious}} titles for Roman women include magistra, a high priestess, female expert or teacher; and ministra, {{a female}} assistant, particularly one {{in service to}} a deity. A magistra or ministra would {{have been responsible for}} the regular maintenance of a cult. Epitaphs provide the main evidence for these priesthoods, and the woman is often not identified in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> marital status.|$|E
25|$|She {{pleaded guilty}} and {{was convicted of}} two counts of second-degree child rape. She was sentenced to six months (three of which were suspended) in the county jail and three years of sex {{offender}} treatment.

25|$|Chopin {{appeared}} {{to express her}} belief in the strength of women. Marquand draws from theories about creative nonfiction in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> work. In order for a story to be autobiographical, or even biographical, Marquand writes, {{there has to be}} a nonfictional element, but more often than not the author exaggerates the truth to spark and hold interest for the readers. Kate Chopin might have been surprised to know her work has been characterized as feminist in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, just as she had been in her own time to have it described as immoral. Critics tend to regard writers as individuals with larger points of view addressed to factions in society.|$|E
25|$|At first, Alfred is {{the prime}} suspect. He has the most to gain financially from his wife's death, and, since he is much younger than Emily was, the Cavendishes already suspect him as a fortune hunter. Evelyn Howard, Emily's companion, seems to hate him. His {{behaviour}} is suspicious; he openly purchased strychnine in the village before Emily was poisoned, and although he denies it, he refuses to provide an alibi. Inspector Japp is keen to arrest him, but Poirot intervenes by proving {{he could not have}} purchased the poison. Inspector Japp arrests John Cavendish. He inherits under the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> will, and there is evidence to suggest he had obtained poison.|$|E
25|$|Mauretania and Lusitania {{were both}} {{designed}} by Cunard naval architect Leonard Peskett, with Swan Hunter and John Brown working from {{plans for an}} ocean greyhound with a stipulated service speed of twenty-four knots in moderate weather, as per the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mail subsidy contract. Peskett's original configuration for the ships in 1902 was a three-funnel design, when reciprocating engines were destined to be the powerplant. A giant model of the ships appeared in Shipbuilder's magazine in this configuration; however, Cunard decided to change power plants to Parson's new turbine technology, and the ship's design was again modified when Peskett added a fourth funnel to the ship's profile. Construction of the vessel finally began with the laying of the keel in August 1904.|$|E

500|$|From 2010, the {{character}} began {{appearing in the}} self-titled series Batwoman. After an introductory [...] "zero" [...] issue in 2010, the series launched fully in 2011 with Batwoman #1 along with DC's company-wide renumbering of its titles that year. Writers J.H. Williams III and W. Haden Blackman chose to expand Kate's supporting cast both in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> family (the Kanes, including Elizabeth, Bette and other relatives), and the [...] "Batman Family" [...] she is more loosely connected to.

50|$|The {{movie was}} {{originally}} known as Sentenced For Life then For the <b>Term</b> <b>of</b> <b>Her</b> Natural Life; the second title was withdrawn after {{the threat of}} legal action by Marcus Clarke's daughter due to its similarity to the novel For the <b>Term</b> <b>of</b> His Natural Life.

500|$|Becky {{is not an}} {{aspirational}} character, she {{strives to}} be normal, satisfied with a [...] "hard up lifestyle". She has changed since her early days, having calmed down a little in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> often out of control behaviour. Of this Kelly comments: [...] "If someone {{had said to me}} that in three years' time she'd be Becky McDonald and would be behind the bar in the Rovers, I wouldn't have believed it [...] When Becky first came in she was a totally different character, but she's calmed down a lot and her softer side has come out." ...|$|E
500|$|Cameron's biographer Spencer Kansa was of {{the opinion}} that Cameron {{exhibited}} parallels with the Australian artist and occultist Rosaleen Norton, both in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> physical appearance and the similarities between their artistic styles. Harrington also saw similarities in the work of Cameron and the artists Leonora Carrington and Leonor Fini. On the website of the Cameron–Parsons Foundation, Michael Duncan expressed the view that Cameron's work rivals that of [...] "fellow surrealists" [...] like Carrington, Fini, Remedios Varo, and Ithell Colquhoun, while also appearing [...] "fascinatingly prescient" [...] of the works by later artists Kiki Smith, Amy Cutler, Karen Kilimmck, and Hernan Bas.|$|E
500|$|Another theme {{present is}} the {{symbolic}} {{nature of the}} house. Margaret Scanlan stated that as in books like Mansfield Park and Jane Eyre, The Good Terrorist [...] "defines a woman in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> house". Writing in the journal Studies in the Novel, Katherine Fishburn said that Lessing often uses a house to symbolise [...] "psychological or ontological change", and that here, [...] "the house... symbolizes Alice's function in the story". Yelin described The Good Terrorist as [...] "an urban, dystopian updating of the house-as-England genre, ... England is represented by a house in London". Writing in [...] "Politics of Feminine Abuse: Political Oppression and Masculine Obstinacy in Doris Lessing's The Good Terrorist, Lalbakhsh and Yahya suggest that the house, and the [...] "oppressive relations" [...] in it, reflect similar oppressive relations in society.|$|E
