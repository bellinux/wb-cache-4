25|$|For {{several centuries}} Lyon, capital of Rhône-Alpes, {{has been known}} as the French capital of gastronomy, due, in part, to the {{presence}} of many of France's finest chefs in the city and its surroundings (e.g. Paul Bocuse).

Beaujolais wine is very popular in Lyon and remains the most common table wine served with local dishes.|$|E
25|$|One further point deserving {{attention}} {{in this context}} is <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>two</b> passages of the Cantong qi are similar to passages found in the Yijing commentary written by Yu Fan (164-233), a major representative of the cosmological tradition. Suzuki Yoshijirō (1977:602-3) suggested that Yu Fan drew on the Cantong qi for his commentary on the Yijing. Pregadio (2011:16-17) has suggested, vice versa, that the Cantong qi presents a poetical rendition of Yu Fan’s passages. If this suggestion is correct, the cosmological portions of the Cantong qi were composed, or at least were completed, {{after the end of the}} Han period.|$|E

Maga decided to run with Paul Darboux, a wealthy northern merchant. Capitalising on growing cynicism regarding southern Dahomey dominating the French colony's politics, he allied himself with the northern tribes.|$|E
25|$|The most {{immediate}} and obvious obstacle to realization {{of these goals}} is <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>two</b> historic Islamic structures which are 13 centuries old, namely the Al Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, are built {{on top of the}} Temple Mount. Israel has undertaken to ensure access to the Temple Mount for peaceful worshippers and visitors, while maintaining public order and security. Any efforts to damage or reduce access to these sites, or to build Jewish structures within, between, beneath, beside, cantilevered on top of, or instead of them, could lead to severe international conflicts, given the association of the Muslim world with these holy places.|$|E
25|$|Scrope v Grosvenor (1389) {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} heraldic law cases brought in England. The case resulted from <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>two</b> different families were using the same undifferenced coat of arms. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the composition of coats of arms was very simple. Most shields consisted of only one charge and two tinctures, and there were times when two families bore the same coat of arms in the same jurisdiction. In the fourteenth century, though, cases of two unrelated families bearing the same coat of arms became less tolerated. When this happened, the monarch was usually called on to make a decision.|$|E

En route to the quarterfinals, Söderling had a bit of luck on <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>two</b> of his opponents retired, including the Russian, who retired when Söderling led 7–5, 3–6, 6–2. Söderling went on to face five-time defending champion and 1st seed Roger Federer for the fourth time this year (three of them in a Grand Slam event). Söderling was defeated by Federer 0–6, 3–6, 7–6(8–6), 6–7(6–8). This was the second time in the pair's 12 meetings that Söderling took a set against Federer.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{following}} season Vogler's reputation suffered. Touring Australia {{for the first}} time as a requirement to all for the proposed Triangular Tournament on 1912, Vogler could not cope with the extremely hard Australian pitches which allowed him no bite with which to spin the ball, nor with the instructions of Australia's captain Warwick Armstrong to hit the googly bowlers off their length at any cost. So ineffective was Vogler that he was left out of two of the Tests and took four wickets in the three he did play – and this in spite of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>two</b> games were played on pitches affected by rain. He also failed as a batsman, averaging only nine an innings as against 21 in England in 1907 on much more difficult pitches.|$|E

25|$|In {{a motion}} made on December 15, 2006, defense {{attorneys}} {{argued that the}} DNA analysis report written by DSI and provided to them by Nifong's office was incomplete, because it omitted information showing {{that none of the}} genetic material from several men found on Mangum matched any DNA sample from the lacrosse team. Brian Meehan, the director of DSI who wrote the misleading report, testified that his lab did not try to withhold information, but acknowledged that the decision not to release the full report violated the lab's policies. Meehan testified that after discussions with Nifong, he decided to withhold the names of the persons excluded by the DNA testing (all 46 tested members of the lacrosse team), {{in order to protect the}} privacy of players not implicated in the case, despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>two</b> players (Reade Seligmann and Collin Finnerty) had already been indicted for rape more than three weeks prior to the release date of the report.

25|$|In 1996, {{producers}} {{decided to}} have Shortland Street undergo a cot death storyline and {{the decision was made}} for the character of Ellen Crozier (Robyn Malcolm) to undergo it. Needing a suitable father character, writers paired Ellen with the relatively new character of David. Ellen and David had been dating for several months but the arrival of his ex-wife Isobel Kearney (Jennifer Ward-Lealand) lead to Ellen thinking the two had reconciled, causing her to flee to Fiji. In a specially shot episode in the country, David tracked her down and the two reconciled, only for Ellen to announce she was pregnant. The couple decided to get married to support the child and lured their friends to the ceremony under the pretense that it was Grace Kwan's (Lyentte Forday) birthday. Producers encountered a problem when developing the storyline, when they realized they had accidentally over run Ellen's pregnancy. A quick fill in story was devised where Ellen was nervous that the baby was so late. In the casting of Ellen and David's child, the daughter of the show's medical adviser was chosen. Having set the storyline up to unfold in 1998, crew members began to get cold feet due to the uneasiness of shooting the scene using one of their co workers own children and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>two</b> of the storyliners had fallen pregnant. On screen, Ellen had an unscheduled birth, giving birth to Rose Crozier-Kearney (Georgia Bishop) in her bathroom, but help arrived in the form of Caroline Buxton (Tandi Wright) just in time. Due to the tenderness of the storyline, it was continuously pushed back until the stage where it was nearing the point of improbability. The plot was ultimately scheduled to air in the last possible week with the potential of cot death to occur. In February 1998, Ellen and David were shocked to discover her baby daughter Rose, had died in her sleep. The scene was shot with the baby's actress but Malcolm was directed to quickly pick her up and then the shot was changed to a close up, to avoid any movements from the child. The couple's devastation at Rose's death saw them break up and date other characters. However, over a year later they finally put Rose to rest and reconciled. The storyline landed Malcolm with her first ever television acting nomination. The subject of a child's death was dealt with once more in the soap, 5 years later in the death of Te Ngakau Hudson.|$|E
