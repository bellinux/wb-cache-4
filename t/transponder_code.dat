5|$|Countries were {{reluctant}} to release information collected from military radar because of sensitivity about revealing their capabilities. Indonesia has an early-warning radar system, but its air traffic control radar did not register any aircraft with the <b>transponder</b> <b>code</b> used by Flight 370, despite the aircraft possibly having flown near, or over, {{the northern tip of}} Sumatra. Indonesian military radar tracked Flight 370 earlier when en route to waypoint IGARI before the transponder is thought to have been turned off, but did not provide information on whether it was detected afterwards. Thailand and Vietnam also detected Flight 370 on radar before the transponder stopped working. The radar position symbols for the <b>transponder</b> <b>code</b> used by Flight 370 vanished after the transponder is thought to have been turned off. Thai military radar detected an aircraft that might have been Flight 370, but it is not known what time the last radar contact was made. The signal did not include identifying data. The flight was also not detected by Australia's conventional or its long-range JORN over-the-horizon radar system, which has an official range of 3,000km, the latter not being in operation {{on the night of the}} disappearance.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB report {{included}} {{a total of}} five recommendations for the FAA. These recommendations included: installing recorders for radar displays, installing audio conversation recorders at air traffic control facilities; establishing climb and descent corridors under ATC positive control in the vicinity of air terminals; and establishing more definitive procedures for receiving and handling the emergency <b>transponder</b> <b>code</b> 7700. Additionally, the NTSB strongly recommended that the FAA and the Department of Defense cooperate to develop a program, in areas where a large intermix of civil and military traffic exists, to ensure that appropriate graphical depictions of airspace utilization and typical flow patterns are prominently displayed at all airports and operational bases for the benefit of all airspace users.|$|E

50|$|The {{civilian}} aircraft {{emergency frequency}} for voice distress alerting is 121.5 MHz. Military aircraft use 243 MHz (which is a harmonic of 121.5 MHz, and therefore civilian beacons transmit on this frequency as well).

25|$|ATC {{instructed}} {{the flight to}} change its <b>transponder</b> <b>code</b> to 7500, the universal signal for hijack, expecting that, {{if they had not}} been hijacked, the pilots would respond to that effect. Instead, they simply complied with the instruction, which ATC took as confirmation that the flight had indeed been hijacked. Worried that a possible hijacked plane might strike a target in Alaska, Governor Tony Knowles ordered the evacuation of large hotels and government buildings in Anchorage. At nearby Valdez, (also in Alaska), the U.S. Coast Guard ordered all tankers filling up with oil to head out to sea. Lt. Gen. Norton Schwartz, {{who was in charge of}} the NORAD planes that scrambled to shadow Flight 85, told reporters in 2001 that he was prepared to order the South Korean airplane to be shot down before it could attack a target in Alaska.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a novel {{approach to}} associate and refine aircraft track data from multiple radar sites. The approach provides enhanced aircraft track accuracy and time synchronization that is compatible with modern air traffic management analysis and sim-ulation tools. Unlike existing approaches where the number of aircraft in the radar data must be assumed, this approach requires no such prior knowledge. While commercial air-craft provide ID tags captured in the radar data {{in the form of}} Mode 3 <b>transponder</b> <b>codes,</b> general aviation often lacks such transponders, which precludes using the number of codes sensed to count the number of aircraft in the data. To meet this challenge, an approach to track an unknown number of unidentified aircraft using a clustering algorithm is proposed. The paper presents a method to relate aircraft between consecutive time frames and refine the trajectories of those vehicles. Experimental results from evaluating the algorithm and demonstrating its viability are provided.

50|$|Aboard the Donnager, the ship's captain {{denies any}} {{knowledge}} of MCRN involvement in {{the attack on the}} Canterbury, and instead suspects that {{one or more of the}} survivors from the shuttle may have bombed the Cant as an act of OPA terrorism. The unknown ships that were pursuing the shuttle ignore warnings to change course and are fired on by the Donnager. To the surprise of the Martian crew, the ships return fire and are revealed to be the same stealth ships that attacked the Cant. Despite the fact that the Donnager is one of the most advanced and deadly warships in the Solar System, it is steadily overwhelmed by the mysterious enemy ships and eventually boarded. During the battle, a railgun round penetrates the hull, decapitating Garvey. Realizing that the Cant survivors are the targets of the attack, a team of the Donnagers Marine contingent are ordered to evacuate them. Although all of the Martian Marines are killed in the process, the four surviving Cant crew members are able to escape aboard the light frigate Tachi just before the Donnager is scuttled. Still unsure of who is trying to kill them, they decide to go to Tycho Station. There, the Cant survivors share what they've seen with Fred Johnson, who reveals that he is an influential member of the OPA. They receive new <b>transponder</b> <b>codes</b> for the Tachi from Fred, disguise the ship as a gas hauler, and rename it the Rocinante.

40|$|Gathering {{empirical}} {{data on the}} factors and processes affecting bedload transport {{in the field is}} difficult. This project conducted during the winter of 1996 field tested a new passive method of positively tracking individual particle movement. The project was conducted in Oak Creek, a gravel bedded stream, located in Corvallis, Oregon. This paper provides an overview of existing techniques of tracking bedload and individual particle movement and gives the results of the field test. The new individual particle tracking technique utilizes a passive radio transponder which can be implanted inside of natural particles. The transponder consists of a microchip that has its own unique hexadecimal identification code. When exposed to a magnetic field the transponder emits a radio signal of the <b>transponder's</b> <b>code</b> which is interpreted by a receiver. This technique provides positive identification and has an estimated life-time of decades. The transponders are relatively inexpensive at approximately 6 dollars each, allowing a statistically significant number of particles to be utilized. A small (2. 7 mm) diameter hole is drilled in the particles. There is no significant discrepancy in volume of the implanted particles. This field test also utilized two other techniques of tracing gravels. A pre-existing vortex bedload sampler was used to capture bedload transport and the implanted particles were painted to aid in visual identification. Sixty-eight implanted particles were placed from November 1995 to February 1996. A large storm event, post placement, in February 1996 created discharges within the Oak Creek study reach. These flows caused scour and transport beyond the research design utilizing prototype equipment. Consequently, three of the implanted particles placed in February 1996 were located after transport, one particle was located twice. The field test provided proof of concept that the passive radio transponder technology can be utilized to track individual particles in natural stream channels. Continued development of the technology is necessary to increase its ease and effectiveness of use. The field test also showed that the efficiency of the passive radio transponder and other tracking techniques are enhanced when more than one monitoring techniques are employed. Empirical data gathered with this and additional techniques can potentially provide detailed information on the controlling factors and processes involved in particle transport in dynamic systems...|$|R
