5|$|Meanwhile, late on 13 February, having {{successfully}} regrouped what forces {{he could}} muster at Bergères-lès-Vertus, Blücher had launched {{an attack against}} Marmont's single division, pushing him out of Étoges and advancing as planned towards Champaubert and Fromentières, {{in the rear of}} Napoleon's force. However, having read Blücher's intentions, Napoleon had given orders for a concentration of French forces in <b>that</b> <b>very</b> sector.|$|E

5|$|On 27 May 927, Simeon died {{of heart}} failure in his palace in Preslav. Byzantine chroniclers tie his death to a legend, {{according}} to which Romanos decapitated a statue which was Simeon's inanimate double, and he died at <b>that</b> <b>very</b> hour.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent to}} which both Graffham and Fortitude North {{influenced}} German strategy in Scandinavia is disputed, with some historians arguing <b>that</b> <b>very</b> little of either deception reached the enemy.

5|$|Additionally, the {{development}} of Theory of Mind {{may play a role}} in emotional development. Theory of Mind is the ability to know that the experience of knowledge and intention lies behind human actions such as facial expressions. Although it is reported <b>that</b> <b>very</b> young infants have different responses to humans than to non-human objects, Theory of Mind develops relatively gradually and possibly results from predictable interactions with adults. However, some ability of this kind must be in place before mutual communication through gaze or other gesture can occur, as it does by seven to nine months. Some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, have been attributed to the absence of the mental functions that underlie Theory of Mind. It is possible that the congenital absence of this ability, or the lack of experiences with caregivers who communicate in a predictable fashion, could underlie {{the development}} of reactive attachment disorder.|$|E
5|$|After {{attaining}} peak intensity, {{the storm}} weakened rapidly {{as it began}} to move west-northwest. Later that morning, MFR downgraded the system into a severe tropical storm. By April 15, MFR downgraded the system into a tropical depression. <b>That</b> <b>very</b> day, the JTWC reported that winds of Helisaonia had fallen below hurricane-force. During the morning hours of April 17, the JTWC downgraded Helisaonina into a depression. Shortly thereafter, MFR stopped monitoring the system. After re-curving just east of Madagascar, Helisanonina dissipated according to the JTWC on April 18. While the storm was weakening, it passed close to Rodrigues without causing any known impact.|$|E

5|$|Coakley's {{rebuttal}} witnesses {{consisted of}} officers who had interrogated the prisoners at Camp Shoemaker. The rebuttal fared poorly, as Veltmann {{was able to}} elicit from them {{that some of the}} accused men had not been informed they could refuse to make a statement, that some of the interrogations had taken place with an armed sentry standing guard, <b>that</b> <b>very</b> few of the prisoners' explanations that they had been afraid of another explosion had been laid down in the statements, and that the officers had emphasized portions of the interrogations that would satisfy Coakley's requirement for evidence of conspiracy. Coakley's last rebuttal witness testified on October 19, and the whole court took October 20 off to allow both sides to prepare closing arguments.|$|E
5|$|I {{feel that}} {{talking about it}} trivializes it. I've been {{studying}} the Cabala , which is the mystical interpretation of the Torah.

5|$|On stage, Harlequin Munchausen, or the Fountain of Love, a {{pantomime}} {{based on}} the Raspe text, was produced in London in 1818, and Herbert Eulenberg made the Baron the main character of a 1900 play, Münchhausen. The Expressionist writer Walter Hasenclever turned the stories into a comedy, Münchhausen, in 1934. Grigori Gorin used the Baron as the hero of his 1976 play <b>That</b> <b>Very</b> Munchausen; a film version was made in 1980. Baron Prášil, a Czech musical about the Baron, opened in 2010 in Prague. The following year, the National Black Light Theatre of Prague toured the United Kingdom with a nonmusical production of The Adventures of Baron Munchausen.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{found out}} <b>that</b> <b>very</b> weak {{electromagnetic}} fields disrupt the magnetic compass used by European robins and other songbirds to navigate using the Earth's magnetic field.

Instead, the culprits consist of frequencies between 2kHz and 5MHz, such as AM radio signals and ordinary electronic equipment that might be found in businesses or private homes.|$|E

5|$|Springbok {{are mainly}} active around dawn and dusk. Activity is {{influenced}} by weather; springbok can feed at night in hot weather, and at midday in colder months. They rest {{in the shade of}} trees or bushes, and often bed down in the open when weather is cooler. The social structure of the springbok {{is similar to that of}} Thomson's gazelle. Mixed-sex herds or harems have a roughly 3:1 sex ratio; bachelor individuals are also observed. In the mating season, males generally form herds and wander in search of mates. Females live with their offspring in herds, <b>that</b> <b>very</b> rarely include dominant males. Territorial males round up female herds that enter their territories and keep out the bachelors; mothers and juveniles may gather in nursery herds separate from harem and bachelor herds. After weaning, female juveniles stay with their mothers until the birth of their next calves, while males join bachelor groups.|$|E
