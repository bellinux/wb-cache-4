40|$|Abstract. Combining {{with both}} working {{condition}} of working roll in <b>tension</b> <b>leveler</b> and wear classification, this paper maintains that abrasive wear {{is the main}} type of working roll’s abrasion, and states that shape defects of hot rolled strip is {{the main cause of}} the abnormal abrasion of working roll, and concludes that to reduce the wear of working roll relying solely on technology of tension leveling has its limits. So, combining with the materials of working roll in <b>tension</b> <b>leveler</b> and rolling mill, the surface hardness and the wear rates of different materials after heat treatment are experimentally analyzed to provide a theoretical guidance for the further improvement of working roll’s materials...|$|E

In this paper, the deformation work in tension leveling was introduced. According to the calculation used in a <b>tension</b> <b>leveler,</b> the tension and deformation curvature which results in less deformation work under a certain elongation is presented.

40|$|Tension {{leveling}} is {{a process}} used in the steel industry in order to eliminate any shape imperfections of cold-rolled thin strips. The master thesis deals with developing a computer program that generates basic parameters of tension leveling line. The theoretical part of the thesis summarizes the types of the shape imperfections in strips, their causes and the principles of their elimination. This part also presents the mechanism of tension leveling and describes the present-day design of <b>tension</b> <b>levelers.</b> The practical part of the thesis starts with an analytical description of stress-strain behaviour of strip during tension leveling (supposing the simplified conditions). A computer program that allows devising basic parameters of tension leveling line is created {{on the basis of}} these analytical relations. The program results are successfully verified by numerical model based on the finite element method (FEM) created in the program ANSYS. Then the interdependencies of certain input and output parameters of created program are determined. These interdependencies can be used as effective design of tension leveling lines...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Deformation {{of round}} {{castings}} due to thermal and/or mechanical strain {{may lead to}} the occurrence of their ovality defects during continuous casting. Presently, ovality defect from thermal deformation have been effectively controlled in actual casting process with the application of more advanced equipments and more sophisticated control strategies. But the control of ovality defect from larger mechanical deformation still cannot satisfy the need of caster design or higher qualified rate of castings. It is shown that excessive hot pressure while strand passes through <b>tension</b> <b>leveler,</b> is the main reason to generate larger mechanical deformation. With consideration of the characteristics of round caster and the requirement of safety production, a theoretical calculated model based on mechanical deformation analysis has been developed in the paper to eliminate ovality defect specially from the over large hot pressure. Calculation analysis suggests that groove design of drive roller and range of round section sizes should be the important consideration for the determination of hot pressure, and there always exists an optimum value for hot pressure when the machine equipments of round caster have been designed and installed. The model can provide a useful guideline for casting engineers to design the groove of drive roller and to determine reasonable safe hot pressure. Reliability of the model analysis has been verified by industrial application on a newly built round caster...|$|E
