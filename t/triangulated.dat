5|$|In 2001, Zhe-Xi Luo {{and colleagues}} {{alternatively}} proposed that a tribosphenic molar pattern had arisen twice (compare Figure 3, top)—once {{giving rise to}} the marsupials and placentals (Boreosphenida), and once producing Ambondro, the Cretaceous Australian Ausktribosphenos, and the living monotremes, which {{first appeared in the}} Cretaceous (united as Australosphenida). They characterized Australosphenida by the shared presence of a cingulum on the outer front corner of the lower molars, a short and broad talonid, a relatively low trigonid, and a <b>triangulated</b> last lower premolar.|$|E
5|$|The {{engine was}} mounted on two main support frames that were {{supported}} by two tubular struts. The frame structure was <b>triangulated</b> and emanated from the fuselage. The main frames were bolted onto the power plant in its top quarter. In turn, the frames were attached to the firewall by universal joints. The firewall itself was constructed from asbestos mesh with dural sheets on both sides. All conduits passing through had to be arranged so that no harmful gases could penetrate the cockpit.|$|E

5|$|Research in the 1960s by Eliécer Silva Celis on {{the rock}} art of Sáchica showed phytomorphic designs, masked human figures, {{singular}} and concentric rings, <b>triangulated</b> heads, and faces where the eyes and noses were drawn, but the mouths absent. The majority of the petrographs found here are abstract figures. The colours red, black and white dominate the rock paintings in Sáchica. The black has been analysed also at El Infiernito and is though {{to refer to a}} pre-Muisca origin. Radial structures drawn on the heads of the anthropomorphic petrographs are interpreted as feathers. Feathers were precious objects for the Muisca and used by the xeques and caciques during the El Dorado ritual in Lake Guatavita.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, they {{measured}} and <b>triangulated</b> the shooting, {{but could not}} determine from which angle Hamilton fired. Burr's shot hit Hamilton in the lower abdomen above the right hip. The bullet ricocheted off Hamilton's second or third false rib, fracturing it and causing considerable damage to his internal organs, particularly his liver and diaphragm, before becoming lodged in his first or second lumbar vertebra. Biographer Ron Chernow considered the circumstances to indicate that, after taking deliberate aim, Burr fired second, while biographer James Earnest Cooke suggested that Burr took careful aim and shot first, and Hamilton fired while falling, after being struck by Burr's bullet.|$|E
25|$|Kempe's {{argument}} goes as follows. First, if planar regions separated by the graph are not <b>triangulated,</b> i.e. {{do not have}} exactly three edges in their boundaries, we can add edges without introducing new vertices {{in order to make}} every region triangular, including the unbounded outer region. If this <b>triangulated</b> graph is colorable using four colors or fewer, so is the original graph since the same coloring is valid if edges are removed. So it suffices to prove the four color theorem for <b>triangulated</b> graphs to prove it for all planar graphs, and without loss of generality we assume the graph is <b>triangulated.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{triangulation}} of a parametrically defined {{surface is}} an easy task. You just <b>triangulate</b> the area of definition (see second picture).

25|$|In 2-dimensions (2D), a {{geologic}} formation or unit {{is represented by}} a polygon, which can be bounded by faults, unconformities or by its lateral extent, or crop. In geological models a geological unit is bounded by 3-dimensional (3D) <b>triangulated</b> or gridded surfaces. The equivalent to the mapped polygon is the fully enclosed geological unit, using a <b>triangulated</b> mesh. For the purpose of property or fluid modelling these volumes can be separated further into an array of cells, {{often referred to as}} voxels (volumetric elements). These 3D grids are the equivalent to 2D grids used to express properties of single surfaces.|$|E
25|$|The Vierendeel truss is a {{structure}} where the members are not <b>triangulated</b> but form rectangular openings, {{and is a}} frame with fixed joints {{that are capable of}} transferring and resisting bending moments. As such, it does not fit the strict definition of a truss (since it contains non-two-force members); regular trusses comprise members that are commonly assumed to have pinned joints, with the implication that no moments exist at the jointed ends. This style of structure was named after the Belgian engineer Arthur Vierendeel, who developed the design in 1896. Its use for bridges is rare due to higher costs compared to a <b>triangulated</b> truss.|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{applications}} in computer-aided manufacturing, CAD, and computer-aided geometric design ask for <b>triangulating</b> pieces of material with defects. These tasks are known collectively as constrained triangulations. Recently, a powerful architecture called the reconfigurable mesh has been proposed: in essence, a reconfigurable mesh consists of a mesh-connected architecture augmented by a dynamically reconfigurable bus system. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} to show that the flexibility of the reconfigurable mesh can be exploited for the purpose of obtaining constant-time algorithms for a number of constrained triangulation problems. These include <b>triangulating</b> a convex planar region containing any constant number of convex holes, <b>triangulating</b> a convex planar region in the presence of a collection of rectangular holes, and <b>triangulating</b> a set of ordered line segments. Specifically, with a collection of O(n) such objects as input, our algorithms run in O(1) time on a reconfig [...] ...|$|R
40|$|During laparoscopic colectomy, {{we usually}} perform a <b>triangulating</b> {{end-to-end}} intestinal anastomosis using a linear cutter {{three times in}} order to complete a safe reconstructive operation {{within a short time}} through a small wound in the abdomen. We herein report the surgical technique and results of the operation. The present study examined 34 patients who underwent a <b>triangulating</b> anastomosis during laparoscopically assisted colectomy. Controls were 18 patients in whom the intestinal anastomosis was performed using Gambee 2 ̆ 7 s hand-sawn method during a similar time period. The mean age was 68. 9 ± 7. 6 years for the patients who had the <b>triangulating</b> anastomosis and 60. 2 ± 9. 3 years for those who had the anastomosis using Gambee 2 ̆ 7 s technique; hence the <b>triangulating</b> anastomosis procedure was chosen for older patients. The time required to complete the <b>triangulating</b> anastomosis and Gambee 2 ̆ 7 s method were 14. 6 ± 2. 9 and 29. 7 ± 3. 3 min, respectively; the former was completed within about half the length of time of that required for the latter. No complications such as anastomotic leakage or stenosis at the site of anastomosis occurred in either group. Bleeding at the anastomosed site was noted in a patient who had the <b>triangulating</b> anastomosis, but it subsided following a conservative therapy. Here described is the <b>triangulating</b> anastomosis for intestinal reconstruction using a linear cutter three times during laparoscopic colectomy. This method is proven to have many advantages including the simplicity and safety of the operational procedure as well as a short operative duration. It is thus suitable to perform intestinal anastomosis through a small wound in the abdomen, and it will be widely used in the future...|$|R
