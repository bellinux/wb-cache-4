5|$|The Adenhart family created <b>the</b> <b>Nick</b> Adenhart Memorial Fund, {{which is}} {{designed}} to provide financial support to youth baseball organizations. The goal is to lend a helping hand to struggling leagues around the country to buy equipment and cover expenses to keep youth baseball functioning. The first presentation from the fund was for $5000 to the Halfway Little League in Halfway, Maryland. Two annual events, <b>the</b> <b>Nick</b> Adenhart 5K Run and Walk and <b>the</b> <b>Nick</b> Adenhart Baseball Camp, have been established to benefit the foundation.|$|E
5|$|The Angels {{established}} <b>the</b> <b>Nick</b> Adenhart Pitcher of the Year award {{given to}} an Angels pitcher for outstanding performance throughout the regular season. The team commissioned Harry Weber {{to create a}} bronze statue of Adenhart, which {{will be on display}} in the Angel Stadium trophy case.

5|$|Adenhart's number 21 jersey was retired by the Cedar Rapids Kernels, the Angels' Class A affiliate, on June 20, 2010. The Kernels, the Kernels Foundation, and the Adenhart {{family also}} {{established}} <b>the</b> <b>Nick</b> Adenhart Memorial Scholarship, a yearly $1,000 scholarship. The Orem Owlz, for whom Adenhart briefly played in 2005, have worn special jerseys, which bear {{the likeness of}} a screen-printed picture of Adenhart, along with his number 34. The Little League Baseball field where Adenhart played in Halfway, Maryland, was rededicated as the Nicholas James Adenhart Memorial Field. The Hagerstown Suns, the Minor League Baseball affiliate in Hagerstown, Maryland, held a fundraiser for <b>the</b> <b>Nick</b> Adenhart Memorial Fund and added Adenhart to their Wall of Fame at Municipal Stadium. The city of Manhattan Beach, Wilhite's home town, erected the Pearson-Wilhite-Stewart-Adenhart Commemorative Wall at Marine Avenue Park honoring all four victims of the crash.|$|E
40|$|Breaks are {{introduced}} into DNA strands when DNA solutions containing ethidium bromide (EB) {{are exposed to}} incandescent light. <b>The</b> <b>nicking</b> rate is sensitive to the concentration of EB and the light intensity. At short exposure times, this rate is limited by photon capture and formation of an intermediate capable of nicking DNA and zero-order nicking kinetics are observed. If the EB is pre-irradiated, <b>the</b> <b>nicking</b> rate is limited by DNA concentration and first-order nicking kinetics are observed. <b>The</b> <b>nicking</b> rate is not greatly affected {{by the presence of}} a low frequency of ribonucleotides in the duplex structure. <b>The</b> <b>nicking</b> reaction produces neither double-strand breaks nor interstrand crosslinks. <b>The</b> <b>nicks</b> produced cannot be closed by DNA ligase. The fluorescent light intensities under normal laboratory conditions are insufficient to induce significant nicking...|$|R
40|$|Replication-dependent {{chromosomal}} breakage {{suggests that}} replication forks occasionally run into nicks in template DNA and collapse, generating double-strand ends. To model replication fork collapse in vivo, I constructed phage λ chromosomes carrying <b>the</b> <b>nicking</b> site of M 13 bacteriophage and infected with these substrates Escherichia coli cells, producing M 13 nicking enzyme. I detected double-strand breaks at <b>the</b> <b>nicking</b> sites in λ DNA purified from these cells. The double-strand breakage depends on (i) {{the presence of}} <b>the</b> <b>nicking</b> site; (ii) <b>the</b> production of <b>the</b> <b>nicking</b> enzyme; and (iii) replication of the nick-containing chromosome. Replication fork collapse at nicks in template DNA explains diverse phenomena, including eukaryotic cell killing by DNA topoisomerase inhibitors and inviability of recombination-deficient vertebrate cell lines...|$|R
40|$|The DNA untwisting enzyme relaxes covalently closed circylar DNAs by <b>the</b> {{sequential}} breaking (<b>nicking)</b> and {{closure of}} one strand of the duplex. The use of highly purified enzyme from rat liver nuclei {{at very high}} protein concentrations has permitted the detection of <b>the</b> <b>nicked</b> intermediate in <b>the</b> reaction. <b>The</b> <b>nicking</b> of closed circular simian virus 40 DNA was measured by alkaline sucrose gradient sedimentation or by equilibrium centrifugation in CsCl gradients containing propidium diiodide. The following observations {{support the hypothesis that}} <b>the</b> <b>nicked</b> DNA represents an intermediate in the untwisting reaction. <b>The</b> extent of <b>nicking</b> does not increase with time. Nicking is observed in the range of salt concentrations where the enzyme is active (0. 01 - 0. 25 M KCl), but is not observed at 0. 50 Mkdl, where enzyme activity is undetectable. <b>The</b> <b>nicked</b> DNA that is generated during the reaction carried out in low salt rapidly disappears if the KCl concentration is raised to 0. 50 M. At constant enzyme concentration, <b>the</b> number of <b>nicks</b> in <b>the</b> reaction mixture is independent of DNA concentration in the range from 3 to 14 mug/ml. The addition of an excess of unlabeled DNA to a reaction initially containing labeled nicked DNA partially chases the label from <b>the</b> <b>nicked</b> intermediate into covalently closed circular DNA...|$|R

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} (neutral-alkali) agarose gel electrophoretic {{system was}} used to separate three families of replicative intermediate (RI) polyoma virus DNA molecules (form I, form II, and form III RIs). Two of these families, form II and III RIs, {{are the result of}} artifactual nicking of one of the parental strands of supercoiled RIs (form I RIs) during in vitro replication of soluble minichromosomes. Kinetic studies in vitro showed that <b>the</b> <b>nicked</b> RIs serve as templates for limited DNA synthesis. <b>The</b> <b>nicked</b> species are not converted into normal products, however. <b>The</b> <b>nicking</b> reaction, which appears to be specific for the parental strands, is dependent on magnesium ions and occurs concurrently with the in vitro synthesis of DNA...|$|R

5|$|The Main Stand covers {{approximately}} {{two thirds of}} the length of the pitch, though the attached enclosure is longer, covering the whole distance. The Main Stand, which seats 4,277 fans, also contains the dressing rooms, club offices and television gantry, {{as well as a number}} of supporting pillars, a car park and <b>the</b> <b>Nick</b> Owen and Eric Morecambe suites. To the Main Stand's right, in the corner above the end of the enclosure and next to the Kenilworth Stand, is the David Preece Stand, a family area which seats 711 spectators.

50|$|Rolling circle DNA {{replication}} is {{initiated by}} an initiator protein encoded by the plasmid or bacteriophage DNA, which nicks one strand of the double-stranded, circular DNA molecule {{at a site}} called the double-strand origin, or DSO. The initiator protein remains bound to the 5' phosphate end of <b>the</b> <b>nicked</b> strand, and <b>the</b> free 3' hydroxyl end is released {{to serve as a}} primer for DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase III. Using the unnicked strand as a template, replication proceeds around the circular DNA molecule, displacing <b>the</b> <b>nicked</b> strand as single-stranded DNA. Displacement of <b>the</b> <b>nicked</b> strand is carried out by a host-encoded helicase called PcrA (the abbreviation standing for plasmid copy reduced) {{in the presence of the}} plasmid replication initiation protein.|$|R

As they leave they bump into a bellhop who is delivering food to Bruckman's room. The bellhop is actually the killer, and when he enters the room (while Havez is in the washroom), he is delighted to discover that Bruckman has been brought right to where he works. As {{he is about to}} kill Bruckman, Havez re-enters and the killer attacks and kills him instead. Meanwhile, Scully finds the same silk fiber at the new crime scene, and realizing that the bellhop had it on his tray, deduces that he is the murderer. They rush back to the hotel. Mulder chases the killer to the basement kitchen and the scene plays out as described in Bruckman's earlier premonition, but when the killer attacks Mulder, Scully arrives in <b>the</b> <b>nick</b> of time and shoots him—what Bruckman had seen was the dying killer's last thoughts, not Mulder's death.|$|E

Junpei, Akihiko and Fuka rush to their aid however the Arcanas easily overwhelm all of their Personas. In the midst of the battle, Fuka also awakens a Persona, Lucia, to defend an entranced Natsuki. However when the Emperor moves to attack her, Makoto arrives in <b>the</b> <b>nick</b> of time and launches a barrage of Persona attacks despite his teammates begging him to flee for his safety. With everyone approaching their physical limits, Fuka uses Lucia to sense the Arcanas' weaknesses and coordinates the SEES members in a collaborative effort which results in the Shadows' defeat. A few days later, Fuka moves into the Iwatodai dorm and repairs her relations with Natsuki, while life returns to a level of normalcy.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Trenyce played Portia in David E. Talbert's play Love in <b>the</b> <b>Nick</b> of Tyme. It toured in North America to {{seventeen}} cities, {{starting in}} the Beacon Theatre in New York in January. In 2010, a film of the play was released on DVD, and its soundtrack was released separately. The film was also broadcast on Black Entertainment Television (BET). Trenyce performed at the Razz Room in San Francisco from July 22 to August 2, 2008. The same year, she made her film debut as Unique in the LGBT independent romantic comedy movie Friends & Lovers: The Ski Trip 2. A year later, she contributed the title track to the soundtrack for the film Truth Hall. Trenyce {{played a role in}} the 30th anniversary revival tour of the musical Ain't Misbehavin' after a recommendation from Ruben Studdard.

5|$|The {{impact of}} the {{conflict}} was not all positive from the French perspective. The revolts in Tyrol and the Kingdom of Westphalia during the conflict were an indication that there was much discontent over French rule among the German population.
