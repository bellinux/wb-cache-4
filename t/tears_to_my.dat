The 45-minute film audible visions of (sic)nesses features Slipknot during and in-between gigs on the All Hope Is Gone World Tour. Shawn Crahan stated that, [...] "Going in and filming this, {{it just seemed like}} there was no way it could fail. It {{was going to be in}} the top five best shows of our careers, and that's basically what it was: we got off the stage and all nine of us [...] felt the same thing, we knew that we destroyed 80,000 people. Watching it back just brings <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> eyes".|$|E
500|$|Macartney {{was a short}} man, {{standing}} 160cm (5" [...] 3). When batting, {{he would}} unconventionally attempt to leg glance yorkers pitched on middle stump down to fine-leg, and often lost his wicket in so doing. He was known for preferring his team-mates to give him candid criticism rather than praise. In later life he condemned modern batsmen; he would explain why he no longer watched cricket by saying [...] "I can't bear watching luscious half-volleys being nudged gently back to bowlers". Sir Neville Cardus wrote that [...] "there was always chivalry in his cricket, a prancing sort of heroism. The dauntlessness of his play, the brave beauty and the original skill bring <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> eyes yet." [...] In the late 1940s, Macartney {{received a letter from}} a compiler of Who's Who in Australia, seeking information on his life. Macartney said that he had [...] "no record of figures, nor am I concerned with them. My only interest is {{the manner in which the}} runs are compiled and how wickets are taken, and in the good of the game." [...] "Those sentiments", wrote former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton, [...] "summed up the cricket story of C. G. Macartney".|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{concluding}} musical number, [...] "Rumour Has It" [...] / [...] "Someone Like You", was acclaimed as {{its main}} highlight. Raymund Flandez described Rivera's vocals as [...] "electrifying" [...] and [...] "golden". Futterman {{wrote that the}} performance was one of Glee best sequences: [...] "Mercedes and Santana nail their vocals and the song combines great tracks {{from one of the}} year's biggest albums while capturing both the sass and sadness of the Troubletones at this particular moment." [...] Votta called it the best performance since the cast's rendition of [...] "Don't Stop Believin' in the season one finale, [...] "Journey to Regionals", and stated, [...] "Naya Rivera's powerful vocals and the strong arrangement still packs the emotional punch Glee was targeting." [...] Chaney awarded the sequence a [...] "A+" [...] grade: [...] "Given the emotional stakes raised by Santana's outing, which happened in the scene right before this performance, {{and the fact that it}} marked the series's 300th musical performance, this marriage" [...] of the two Adele songs, [...] "Rumour Has It" [...] and [...] "Someone Like You", was [...] "all the more powerful". Moyler asserted that the number was [...] "perfection" [...] and said, [...] "This is why I watch Glee. It is just brilliant from Mercedes first belting to the snaps on the beat to the choreography with the girls walking in a circle and making little whispers to Santana bringing <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> eyes singing 'Someone Like You' as if it was the last song she'll ever sing in her damn life." [...] Cinema Blend's Melissa Duko stated that the show [...] "hit it out of the park" [...] and added that it was her favorite performance of the season. Slezak gave the number an [...] "A+" [...] and wrote, [...] "Nobody can completely match Adele doing Adele, and yet Naya Rivera and Amber Riley somehow made the sum of this mashup a worthy equal to Adele's glorious original parts." [...] In December 2012, TV Guide named the mash-up one of Glee best performances.|$|E

2500|$|On April 1, 2014, Mikulski {{introduced}} the Paycheck Fairness Act (S. 2199; 113th Congress), [...] {{a measure that}} aims to strengthen the Fair Labor Standards Act's protections against pay inequalities based on gender. It is a bill that [...] "punishes employers for retaliating against workers who share wage information, puts the justification burden on employers as to why someone is paid less and allows workers to sue for punitive damages of wage discrimination". Mikulski said that [...] "it brings <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> eyes to know women are working so hard and being paid less" [...] and that [...] "it makes me emotional when I hear that... I get angry, I get outraged and I get volcanic".|$|E
2500|$|On 8 March 1932, Puyi {{made his}} {{ceremonial}} entry into Changchun, sharing his car with Zheng who was beaming with joy, Amakasu whose expression was stern as usual, and Wanrong, who looked miserable. Puyi remembered about {{his first time}} in Changchun: [...] "I saw Japanese gendarmes, and rows of people, wearing all sots of clothes; some were in Chinese jackets and gowns, some were in Western suits and some in traditional Japanese dress, {{and they were all}} holding small flags in their hands. I was thrilled and reflected that I was now seeing the scene that I missed at the harbor. As I walked past them Hsi Hsia [...] pointed out a line of dragon flags between the Japanese ones and said that the men holding them were all Manchu [...] "bannermen" [...] who had been waiting for me to come for twenty years. These words brought <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> eyes, and I was more strongly convinced than ever that my future was very hopeful". Puyi also noted he was [...] "too preoccupied with my hopes and hates" [...] to realize the [...] "cold comfort that the Changchun citizens, silent from terror and hatred, were giving me". Puyi's friend, the British journalist Woodhead, who covered his arrival in Manchuria, wrote [...] "outside official circles, I met no Chinese who felt any enthusiasm for the new regime", and that the city of Harbin was being terrorized by Chinese and Russian gangsters working for the Japanese, making Harbin [...] "lawless... even its main street unsafe after dark". In an interview with Woodhead, Puyi stated he planned to govern Manchukuo “in the Confucian spirit” and he was “perfectly happy” with his new position. An Italian journalist from the Corriere della Sera newspaper wrote: “I was unable to interview this pale, tired prince who doesn’t’ like to talk, who is always plunged in his meditations and who maybe regrets his life as a simple, studious citizen. He has a fixed stare behind his black-framed glasses. When we were introduced, he responded with a friendly nod. But his smile lasted only a second. We could only await the word of the Master of Ceremonies to give us permission to bow ourselves out. A Japanese colonel, our guide, showed us the triumphal arches, the electric light decorations and endless flags. But all this, say the shopkeepers is [...] "made in Osaka"”.|$|E

6000|$|The <b>tears</b> come <b>to</b> <b>my</b> eyes, as I {{think of}} the Last Day of Old Dumbuck, for, take it as you will, there was a last day of Dumbuck, as of windy Ilios, and of [...] "Carthage left deserted of the sea." ...|$|R

6000|$|What I {{think of}} him? Why, I {{think he is}} the only great man of his age, {{speaking}} of public men. I think 'Napoleon III devant le peuple anglais' a magnificent State paper.

60|$|That night, {{after he}} had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to forget even {{to shake hands with}} me, but left the room in silence.

60|$|It was dreadful {{to me to}} see the Bart mount {{his horse}} and ride off with hanging head. I could not endure it. I threw myself before this English General. I pleaded with him for my friend.

60|$|We {{were now}} {{in the region of}} great snowfields, under which roared swift streams from still higher altitudes.

60|$|Dear, {{precious}} Anneke! How admirably did she behave that memorable night! It {{was certainly}} an extraordinary {{situation in which}} to speak of love; yet, I much question if the feelings be not {{more likely to be}} true and natural at such times, than when circumstances admit of more of the expedients of every-day life. I could see that my sweet listener was touched, from the moment I commenced, and that her countenance betrayed a tender interest in what I said.
