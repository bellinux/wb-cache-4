25|$|Dissatisfaction {{over this}} {{decision}} led about 70 pastors {{and a similar}} number of congregations to leave the WELS, ELS, and LCMS to form the Church of the Lutheran Confession (CLC). Their chief complaint was that the WELS misapplied the principles of Christian fellowship by not breaking immediately with the Synodical Conference and the LCMS after it had publicly recognized doctrinal disagreements. While the WELS broke fellowship with the LCMS in 1961, the CLC and the WELS remain at odds regarding <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>to</b> this day. Recently, the WELS and ELS have been in formal discussions with the CLC over doctrinal issues. The goal of these discussions is to restore fellowship with each other.|$|E
25|$|He {{lived out}} the Friends' Peace Testimony by protesting the French and Indian War (1754–1763), the North American {{front of the}} Seven Years' War between Great Britain and France. In 1755, he decided to oppose paying those colonial taxes that {{supported}} the war and urged tax resistance among fellow Quakers in the Philadelphia Meeting, even {{at a time when}} settlers on the frontier were being attacked by French and allied Native Americans. Some Quakers joined him in his protest, and the Meeting sent a letter on <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>to</b> other groups. In one of his prophetic dreams, recorded in his Journal, Woolman negotiated between two heads of state in an effort to prevent a war.|$|E

Out of the seventeen, the National Law University, Delhi conducts its own separate entrance test known as All India Law Entrance Test. With the emergence of other law schools, which also sought to conduct their admission tests at around the same time, students faced a hard time preparing for them. From time to time <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>to</b> conduct a common entrance exam to reduce the burden of the students to give multiple test was raised, but given the autonomous status of each law school, there was no nodal agency to co-ordinate an action to this regard.|$|E
25|$|When Pacific Mail proved {{unable to}} {{initiate}} its new packet {{service on the}} date stipulated in the June 1872 statute, Congress was obliged {{to decide whether or}} not to cancel the subsidy. Gould seized on <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>to</b> further his scheme of damaging the company's reputation. He organized a lobbying campaign to persuade Congress to rescind the subsidy, while Roach, concerned that without the subsidy Pacific Mail might be unable to meet its debts, lobbied for retaining it. Unknown to Roach, his trusted friend and adviser, the lawyer William E. Chandler who was acting as Roach's main Washington lobbyist, also had Gould as a client, a conflict of interest that encouraged Chandler's reticence. As a result, Roach's lobbying was ineffective at combating Gould's attempt to portray Roach as an unethical raider of the public purse.|$|E
25|$|One interpretation, {{which was}} adopted during the Cold War, is {{that either the}} PRC or the ROC is the sole {{rightful}} government of all China and that the other government is illegitimate. While much of the western bloc maintained relations with the ROC until the 1970s under this policy, much of the eastern bloc maintained relations with the PRC. While {{the government of the}} ROC considered itself the remaining holdout of the legitimate government of a country overrun by what it thought of as Communist rebels, the PRC claimed to have succeeded the ROC in the Chinese Civil War. Though the ROC no longer portrays itself as the sole legitimate government of China, the position of the PRC remained unchanged until the early 2000s, when the PRC began to soften its position on <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>to</b> promote Chinese reunification.|$|E

500|$|One of the inspirations {{behind the}} {{creation}} of the game was technological advances that made it possible to implement certain elements that could not be done in previous Mario games. Satoru Iwata explained that [...] "since 1996, when Mario appeared in 3D in Super Mario 64, it's always been hard for players to judge how to jump and hit a block floating in a 3D space," [...] musing that the Nintendo 3DS autostereoscopy allowed for <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>to</b> be fixed. The development team, which only had experience developing on consoles rather than handhelds, first tried playing Super Mario Galaxy 2 on a small television monitor. When it was found that Mario was too small to see and thus difficult to control, 3D Lands camera system and level terrain needed to be designed for viewing on the small Nintendo 3DS screen, making it easier for players to keep track of Mario. Certain aspects of gameplay were inspired by Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda franchise, including the way that the camera functioned during certain moments. Ideas that were ultimately not incorporated into 3D Land included a pro skater suit for Mario, the ability to change Mario's size to the extreme, and a feature that replaces Princess Peach's face with a photographed face. The game's title was chosen as an homage to the Super Mario Land games released on the Game Boy.|$|E

The aim of <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> is <b>to</b> raise questions about hospitality and work, not just in business and managerial terms, but in terms that transgress a diversity of fields and perspectives. Specifically, the articles in <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> call attention <b>to</b> the employee voice and experience; issues of gender; performance, embodiment and emotional labour; <b>to</b> broader <b>issues</b> concerning labour mobilities and meaningful work. As earlier versions of these articles were presented at the Critical Tourism Studies Conference, University of Wales Cardiff in July 2011, <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> aims <b>to</b> link critical hospitality and critical tourism research and pedagogy. Aligned to the aims of this journal, we aim to further encourage a move in hospitality studies towards more critical paths of enquiry (Tribe 2005), to advocate a critical turn (Ateljevic et al. 2007), and to amass critical thinkers, studying a critical issue and engage critical theory (Wilson et al. 2008, 2012) ...|$|R
500|$|Ofcom {{estimates}} {{that even after}} extra spectrum has been allocated to DAB, around 90local radio stations {{will be unable to}} transmit on DAB, either because there is no space for them on a local DAB multiplex, or because they cannot afford the high transmission costs of DAB that the multiplex operators are charging. Ofcom announced in 2005 that it regarded Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) as an option for local stations unable to secure carriage or unable to pay the high transmission costs of DAB. The success of the small scale DAB multiplexes may alleviate <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>to</b> some degree. One of the drawbacks of DAB and DAB+ has not been addressed. In simple terms the frequency of a broadcast is the carrier frequency (i.e. a sine wave). In order to carry any information the carrier frequency must be modulated. The signal at the receiver (radio) is then demodulated and the information is retrieved. The demodulators for FM signals are almost instantaneous so that one can have radios in different areas and move between those areas to hear the broadcast continuously. In contrast the demodulators for digital signals take a finite time and each digital radio takes a different time to demodulate the broadcast signal, so that if you move between different radios that are spatially apart you are likely to hear the same part of the broadcast twice or miss parts of it depending on the time to demodulate the signal of the individual radios. The other drawback with DAB is that it is all or nothing. If there is any interference or loss due to moving out of the footprint of the broadcast signal you will receive no signal, whereas in the case of FM you can hear something even if it is crackly.|$|E
