25|$|The transit <b>timing</b> <b>variation</b> method {{considers}} whether transits {{occur with}} strict periodicity, {{or if there}} is a variation. When multiple transiting planets are detected, they can often be confirmed with the transit <b>timing</b> <b>variation</b> method. This is useful in planetary systems far from the Sun, where radial velocity methods cannot detect them due to the low signal-to-noise ratio. If a planet has been detected by the transit method, then variations in the timing of the transit provide an extremely sensitive method of detecting additional non-transiting planets in the system with masses comparable to Earth's.

25|$|The main {{drawback}} of {{the transit}} timing method is that usually not {{much can be}} learned about the planet itself.

Afterwards, Variation Logic is inserted to apply the <b>timing</b> <b>variations.</b> Moreover, the circuit TAM is enhanced by Time Control (TC) logic to model the circuit frequency. We apply the proposed methodology to analyze a circuit or an approximate circuit under <b>timing</b> <b>variations</b> as well as to analyze a circuit under timing-induced errors for approximate computing.

A 2012 study found that the rate of false positives for transits observed by the Kepler mission could be as high as 40% in single-planet systems. [...] For this reason, a star with a single transit detection requires additional confirmation, typically from the radial-velocity method or orbital brightness modulation method. Radial velocity method is especially necessary for Jupiter-sized or larger planets as objects of that size encompass not only planets, but also brown dwarfs and even small stars. As false positive rate is very low in stars with two or more planet candidates, they often can be validated without extensive follow-up observations.

In this paper, we propose a framework for simulating and analyzing the HCI-induced <b>timing</b> <b>variations</b> at high abstraction level. We first present a bottom-up approach to move information about timing degradation up to the higher abstraction layers.

40|$|The transits of {{a planet}} on a Keplerian orbit occur at time {{intervals}} exactly equal to {{the period of the}} orbit. If a second planet is introduced the orbit is not Keplerian and the transits are no longer exactly periodic. We compute the magnitude of these <b>variations</b> in the <b>timing</b> of the transits, dt. We investigate analytically several limiting cases: (i) interior perturbing planets with much smaller periods; (ii) exterior perturbing planets on eccentric orbits with much larger periods; (iii) both planets on circular orbits with arbitrary period ratio but not in resonance; and (iv) planets on initially circular orbits locked in resonance. Case (iv) is perhaps the most interesting case since some systems are known to be in resonances and the perturbations are the largest. As long as the perturber is more massive than the transiting planet, the <b>timing</b> <b>variations</b> would be of order of the period regardless of the perturber mass! For lighter perturbers, we show that the <b>timing</b> <b>variations</b> are smaller than the period by the perturber to transiting planet mass ratio. An earth mass planet in 2 : 1 resonance with a 3 -day period transiting planet (e. g. HD 209458 b) would cause <b>timing</b> <b>variations</b> of order 3 minutes, which would be accumulated over a year. These are easily detectable with current ground-based measurements. For the case of both planets on eccentric orbits, we compute numerically the transit <b>timing</b> <b>variations</b> for several cases of known multiplanet systems assuming they were edge-on. Transit timing measurements may be used to constrain the masses and radii of the planetary system and, when combined with radial velocity measurements, to break the degeneracy between mass and radius of the host star.

Conventional high level synthesis relies on the worst-case delay analysis to guide the design space exploration, however, such worst-case timing analysis can results in overly conservative designs with pessimistic performance estimation. This paper presents a 0 - 1 integer linear programming (ILP) formulation that aims at reducing the impact of <b>timing</b> <b>variations</b> in high-level synthesis, by integrating overall timing yield constraints into scheduling and resource binding. The proposed approach focuses on how to achieve the maximum performance (minimum latency) under given timing yield constraints with affordable computation time.

50|$|The star is a {{pulsating}} {{white dwarf}} of type DAV, with an extremely stable period. Small {{variations in the}} phase of pulsation led to {{the suggestion that the}} star was being orbited by a giant planet which caused the pulsations to be delayed due to the varying distance to the star caused by the reflex motion about the system's centre-of-mass. Observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope failed to directly detect the planet, which put an upper limit on the mass of 5-6 Jupiter masses. Investigation of a separate pulsation mode revealed <b>timing</b> <b>variations</b> in antiphase with the variations in the originally-analysed pulsation mode. This would not be the case if the variations were caused by an orbiting planet, and thus the <b>timing</b> <b>variations</b> must have a different cause.
