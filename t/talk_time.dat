Built into the battery is near field communication (NFC) connectivity, which allows users to share map directions and YouTube videos quickly using Wi-Fi Direct (through Android Beam), and perform non-touch payments at shops that employ specially equipped NFC cash registers. The battery can be wirelessly charged using a special charging pad (sold separately) that utilizes magnetic resonance to produce a magnetic field through which electricity could be transferred.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{spontaneous}} <b>talking</b> <b>time</b> {{of patients and}} its influencing variables. Patients already disclose with their first expressions important aspects of their current complaints and their medical history and are interrupted by their physicians on average after 19 seconds because of the physicians’ concerns to be swamped by their patients’ complaints. If one asks physicians, how long patients talk unhindered, they estimate an average <b>talking</b> <b>time</b> of {{three and a half}} minutes. In the context of this not-randomized survey-study, data from 501 patients out of six family doctor practices from different quarters in Berlin were collected. Using a stop watch the “spontaneous talking time” was measured, after the patient had been requested to narrate and encouraged with nonverbal signals, until the patient indicated that his or her list of complaints was complete and the physician was prompted {{to take part in the}} conversation. Additional parameters of patients and physicians were raised and evaluated descriptively statistically on the basis of questionnaires. Now the spontaneous <b>talking</b> <b>time</b> was 64 seconds (SD 60 seconds, median 52 seconds). In consultations with a new clinical problem the <b>talking</b> <b>time</b> length was 63 seconds and those of follow- ups conversations 65 seconds. The following characteristics of patients influenced the outcome: the <b>talking</b> <b>time</b> increased with the rising age of the patient, patients with acute diseases showed <b>talking</b> <b>times</b> of 53 seconds; chronically sick people spoke nearly 70 seconds and multiply chronically patients talked 76 seconds. The following characteristics of the participating physicians resulted in the following: The older the physician the more the spontaneous discussion time decreased. In addition female patients talked twelve seconds longer with lady doctors than with male colleagues. Male patients did not show a difference regarding the physicians’ sex in their spontaneous <b>talking</b> <b>time.</b> Differences in language and culture seem to be an influence on the average length of the patients’ monologue due to the fact that the average spontaneous <b>talking</b> <b>time</b> of 64 seconds is 50 per cent more than the existing studies in general practices performed in the USA, Israel and Slovenia. However, longer monologues were presented in outpatient clinic studies as well as in a German practice analysis of 20 first consultations. Patients do not over expand their granted timeframes usually. Physicians do not have to protect themselves by intervening early and have to take no risk when not interrupting the patients’ flow of speech. The fear of being swamped by their patients’ narrations is unfounded. One minute of listening will be sufficient on the average and should be possible even in a busy practice. The patient gets the possibility to outline their requests, concerns and doubts. Therewith the physician wins perspectives that expand his options for the patients...|$|R

Not thrilled at the idea, Jack is told to compromise; Amber-Louise admits to Jack that she is a lesbian, and is merely pretending to be an ultra-conservative Christian to get by in the TV world.
