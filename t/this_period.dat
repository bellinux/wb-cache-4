5|$|During {{the period}} 2000–500 BCE, {{in terms of}} culture, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic to the Iron Age. The Vedas, the oldest scriptures {{associated}} with Hinduism, were composed during <b>this</b> <b>period,</b> and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain. Most historians also consider <b>this</b> <b>period</b> to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west. The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labeling their occupations impure, arose during <b>this</b> <b>period.</b> On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from <b>this</b> <b>period</b> suggests {{the existence of a}} chiefdom stage of political organisation. In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from <b>this</b> <b>period,</b> as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.|$|E

5|$|The Scottish {{economy of}} <b>this</b> <b>period</b> was {{dominated}} by agriculture and by short-distance, local trade. There was an increasing amount of foreign trade in the period, as well as exchange gained by means of military plunder. By the end of <b>this</b> <b>period,</b> coins were replacing barter goods, {{but for most of}} <b>this</b> <b>period</b> most exchange was done without the use of metal currency.|$|E
5|$|The archaeological {{record for}} <b>this</b> <b>period</b> is {{relatively}} scant, although improving.

5|$|The {{language}} spoken during <b>this</b> <b>period</b> {{is thought to}} be Southwestern Brythonic, but only one or two inscribed stones survive in Somerset from <b>this</b> <b>period.</b> However, a couple of curse tablets found in the baths at Bath may be in this language. Some place names in Somerset seem to be Celtic in origin and may be from <b>this</b> <b>period</b> or earlier, e.g. Tarnock. Some river names, such as Parrett, may be Celtic or pre-Celtic. The religion of the people of Somerset in <b>this</b> <b>period</b> {{is thought to be}} Christian but it was isolated from Rome until after the Council of Hertford in 673AD when Aldhelm was asked to write a letter to Geraint of Dumnonia and his bishops. Some church sites in Somerset are thought to date from <b>this</b> <b>period,</b> e.g., Llantokay Street.|$|E

5|$|A small navy had {{operated}} at {{a fairly}} low level after the Second Samnite War, {{but it was}} massively upgraded during <b>this</b> <b>period,</b> expanding from a few primarily river- and coastal-based patrol craft to a full maritime unit. After a period of frenetic construction, the navy mushroomed to a size of more than 400 ships on the Carthaginian pattern. Once completed, it could accommodate up to 100,000 sailors and embarked troops for battle. The navy thereafter declined in size. This was partially because a pacified Roman Mediterranean called for little naval policing, and partially because the Romans chose to rely during <b>this</b> <b>period</b> on ships provided by Greek cities, whose peoples had greater maritime experience.|$|E

5|$|Architecture of Scotland in the Industrial Revolution {{includes}} all building in Scotland between the mid-eighteenth {{century and the}} end of the nineteenth century. During <b>this</b> <b>period,</b> the country underwent an economic and social transformation as a result of industrialisation, which was reflected in new architectural forms, techniques and scale of building. In the second half of the eighteenth century, Edinburgh was the focus of a classically inspired building boom that reflected the growing wealth and confidence of the capital. Housing often took the form of horizontally divided tenement flats. Some of the leading European architects during <b>this</b> <b>period</b> were Scottish, including Robert Adam and William Chambers.|$|E
