40|$|In later {{adulthood}} brain pathology becomes {{common and}} trajectories of cognitive change are heterogeneous. Among the multiple determinants of late-life cognitive course, cognitive reserve {{has been proposed}} as an important factor that modifies or buffers the impact of brain pathology on cognitive function. This article presents and investigates a novel method for measuring and investigating such factors. The core concept {{is that in a}} population where pathology is common and variably present, ‘reserve’ may be defined as the difference between the cognitive performance predicted by an individual's level of pathology and that individual's actual performance. By this definition, people whose measured cognitive performance is better than predicted by pathology have high reserve, whereas those who perform worse than predicted have low reserve. To test this hypothesis, we applied a latent variable model to data from a diverse ageing cohort and decomposed the variance in a measure of episodic memory into three components, one predicted by demographics, one predicted by pathology as measured by structural MRI and a ‘residual’ or ‘reserve’ term that included all remaining variance. To investigate the plausibility of this approach, we then <b>tested</b> <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> component as an operational measure of reserve. Specific predictions about the effects of this putative reserve measure were generated from a general conceptual model of reserve. Each was borne from the results. The results show that the current level of reserve, as measured by this decomposition approach, modifies rates of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia, modifies rates of longitudinal decline in executive function and, most importantly, attenuates the effect of brain atrophy on cognitive decline such that atrophy is more strongly associated with cognitive decline in subjects with low reserve than in those with high reserve. Decomposing the variance in cognitive function scores offers a promising new approach to the measure and study of cognitive reserve...|$|E
40|$|Phase-out of {{methyl bromide}} and health {{concerns}} {{related to the}} use of pesticides are increasing the interest in alternative control strategies. Soil solarization is an effective, safe and cheap technique for the control of soil-borne pathogens and weeds.

An untreated soil was used as a control. At the end of each crop cycle yield parameters were recorded, weeds were identified and counted, and nematode infestation was evaluated. Our results show that a single solarization treatment significantly increased yields by + 116 %, and strongly reduced nematode infestation of − 99 % of infested plants and of − 98 % of the root gall index in the following melon crop. It also suppressed annual weed emergence three years later.

Further, twoand three-year solarization treatments almost completely suppressed the infestation of the M. javanica nematode in tomato, and reduced the nematode effect in melon by − 86 % and − 79 %, respectively. Repeated solarization treatments also resulted in a high reduction of emergence of most weed species in all crop cycles.

40|$|With an {{increasing}} human population comes a greater demand for food. Those involved in food production {{are under pressure}} to increase agricultural output. A major threat to crop yield is the loss incurred by pests, specifically insects. Modern farming methods are subject to regulations that forbid the use of once deadly chemicals to control these threats rendering management more difficult. In the Neotropics, the major agricultural pest threat are leafcutting ants (Atta and Acromyrmex). These ants exhibit a well-structured social organisation, fungus cultivation, colony hygiene and a complex nest structure {{that allows them to}} overcome most pest management control methods. Living in such large colonies creates substantial amounts of waste material within the nest, which leafcutting ants often avoid contact with because of the pathogenic microorganisms that it harbours. The use of this waste material has previously been proposed as a natural deterrent method against leafcutting ant attack. Previous studies in this area tested the repellent effects using solid waste material collected from nests, I propose that the same repellent effects are present in waste odour. I tested experimentally whether the leafcutting ant Atta cephalotes would exhibit similar behaviour to waste odour as they do with solid waste material. I also <b>tested</b> <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> effectiveness of ant waste odour as a repellent over a period of time.

However, this deterrent effect was only found to be effective for up to five days before the behavioural responses to it were not considered to be significant.

40|$|Soybean (Glycinemax (L.) MERR.) is {{recognized}} as a potent food allergen causing {{one of the most}} frequent food allergies worldwide. The effect of high pressure processing (HPP) prior to and during enzymatic hydrolysis using the enzyme preparation Flavourzyme® on the degree of hydrolysis (DH), molecular weight distribution (SDS-PAGE) and β-conglycinin (Glym 5) immune reactivity of soy protein isolate (SPI) was studied. Enzymatic hydrolysis was carried out at atmospheric pressure (0. 1 MPa) and HPP (100 – 600 MPa) at 50 °C for 15 min. Pressures higher than 300 MPa enhanced the degradation of Gly m 5, which was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS analyses. The immunoreactivity of the samples was assessed by invitro sandwich ELISA using mouse monoclonal anti-Gly m 5 antibodies. Depending on the antibody <b>tested,</b> <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> immunoreactivity was completely inhibited or significantly impaired up to 99. 5 % applying HPP during hydrolysis at 400 and 500 MPa. By means of principal component analysis, the beany and green off-flavors characteristic for unprocessed SPI could be reduced by pressure enhanced hydrolysis at 400 – 500 MPa. The resulting hydrolysates possessed improved protein solubility, foaming activities and oil-binding capacities, which were improved by 45 %, 66 %, and 210 %, respectively. HPP prior to and during enzymatic hydrolysis at 400 – 500 MPa constitutes an innovative approach for the production of low-allergen food ingredients that combine good taste and enhanced functional properties. Industrial relevance: Food allergy has emerged in the last years as the incidence and prevalence are rising dramatically. Up to now, enzymatic hydrolysis is the only feasible method to mitigate soy allergy. However, the major drawback associated with enzymatic hydrolysis is the incomplete destruction of allergenic epitopes and the formation of a strong bitter taste. This research activity demonstrates that high pressure assisted enzymatic hydrolysis using the enzyme preparation Flavourzyme effectively reduces the immunoreactivity of soy proteins. Degree of hydrolysis analysis, SDS-PAGE, mass spectrometry as well as sandwich ELISAwithmousemonoclonalanti-Glym 5 antibodieshave been applied to analyze the destruction of allergenic proteins as well as to determine the residual immunoreactivity. This study provides preliminary evidence that this innovative combination process of high pressure and enzymatic hydrolysis has great potential to produce tasty low-allergen soy-based food ingredients with good physicochemical properties, i. e. protein solubility and foam ability...|$|E
40|$|Summary The {{thesis is}} {{composed}} by three chapter. The first chapter {{deals with the}} biochemical and biocathalytic characterization of a novel Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase from the halophilic archibacterium Haloterrigena turkmenica. The second chapter deals with the studying of the functional role of novel Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases from two photosynthetic organisms: the moss Physcomitrella patens and the red alga Cynidioschyzon merolae. The third chapter deals with the studying of the recombinant expression and the enzymatic activity of the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase involved in the biosynthesis of saffron in Crocus sativus. 1. 1 Chapter I Baeyer–Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) are attractive “green” catalysts able to produce chiral esters or lactones starting from ketones. They can act as natural equivalents of peroxyacids that are the catalysts classically used in the organic synthesis reactions, consisting in the cleavage of C-C bonds with the concomitant insertion of an oxygen atom. In this study the gene encoding a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase from Haloterrigena turkmenica (Ht), a halophilic archibacterium from the sulfate saline soil of Turkmenistan, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein, Ht-BVMO, was purified and biochemically characterized. This novel BVMO is the first enzyme of this class that originates from the Archaea domain. The particular amino acid composition of this BVMO is consistent with other halophilic enzymes, which are characterized by {{a large number of}} negatively charged aminoacids on their surface to prevent the precipitation in high salt environments. Some ketone compounds described as standard substrates of BVMOs have been tested in enzymatic assays and the effect of salt concentration on the enzyme was studied using different kinds of inorganic salts at different concentration. A clear salt-dependent activity was observed, with no detectable activity in the absence of salt and maximum activity in molar salt concentrations. Despite the particular conditions required for the enzyme to be functional, we investigated the biocatalityc potential of Haloterrigena turkmenica Baeyer Villiger monooxygenase (Ht-BVMO) in converting the ketone substrates into ester products. The main issue that we had to face was finding the proper reaction conditions useful for both a halophilic enzyme and a mesophilic NADPH regeneration enzyme. We <b>tested</b> <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> activity of both enzymes in a range of NaCl concentrations and chose to carry out the bioconversions in 1 M NaCl. In this condition the enzymes resulted stable and all the tested substrates were completely converted. As salt tends to greatly reduce water activity of the medium, halophilic enzymes are though to have interesting applications in biocatalytic processes performed in low water activity environments, like aqueous/organic media. In order to probe the potentialities of Ht-BVMO in these kind of media, the effect of various organic solvents was evaluated on the catalytic activity. Results shows that salt at high concentration, essential to maintain the enzymatic activity of the halophilic enzyme under standard conditions, may be partially replaced by organic solvents. The new enzyme, beside widening the panel of available Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases, displays peculiar biochemical properties and tolerance to organic solvent that render it interesting for biotechnological applications. 1. 2 Chapter II All identified Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases originate from bacteria or fungi and most of them work in catabolic pathway, in which they are involved in the degradation of organic molecules. Two novel BVMOs from an acidophilic red alga, Cyanidioschyzon merolae, and the moss Physcomitrella patens have been recently cloned and expressed in recombinant form. These two proteins are the first Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases found in photosynthetic organisms. To characterize these new enzymes several known BVMO substrates were tested. The enzymes showed a slight preference for long chain aliphatic ketones; however, the catalytic activity resulted rather low. Their activity on long chain aliphatic ketones, already verified in vitro, raises the hypothesis of a possible involvement of these BVMOs in the degradative or synthetic pathways of photosynthetic pigments. To study the physiological function of these novel enzymes, so far unexplored in photosynthetic organisms, but also to probe their effective biocathalytic potentialities, we are interested in discovering their natural substrate. To this aim, we have chosen a reverse genetic approach. It is known that both Physcomitrella patens and Cyanidioschyzon merolae are organisms prone to homologous recombination. Physcomitrella patens, in particular, is a well-known model organism. Gene targeting techniques have been widely applied to P. patens, providing useful information for understanding plant evolution mechanisms. We obtained BVMO knock-out mutants, for this organism, but unluckily {{we were not able to}} identify a clear phenotype associated with the null mutants. The chromatographic profiles of the photosynthetic pigments extracted from the wild type moss and the BVMOs knock-out mutants were compared, but no significant variations emerged. On the other hand, Cyanidioschyzon merolae is an acidophilic unicellular red alga whose nuclear and plastidial genomes have been sequenced. Although gene targeting has been already reported [95], routine tools and methods are still missing. We planned to produce a BVMO knock-out of this alga, reverting the prototrophy in a Cyanidioschyzon merolae mutant (called M 4) that shows auxotrophy for uracil. Using the M 4 mutant as recipient, we planned to disrupt the BVMO gene using a DNA construct composed by the wild type URA 5. 3 (the gene encoding the orotidine 5 ’-monophosphate decarboxylase in C. merolae) as marker gene and the 5 ’ and 3 ’ sequence of the BVMO as flanking regions for the homologous recombination. The techniques for laboratory cultivation and genetic manipulation for this organism still require optimizations and although we were able to growth the alga in both liquid and solid medium, the attempts to obtain transformants resulted unsuccessful. 1. 3 Chapter III Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases are enzymes that catalyse the cleavage of carbon double bond in organic molecules. The possibility to use these enzymes for biocatalytic applications caught the interest of many chemical companies. Unlike other biocatalysts that catalyse the double bond cleavage (e. g peroxygenases), carotenoid dioxygenases are characterized by an exquisite regiosectivity and are not affected by promiscuous activities that can produce side-products. Most of CCDs are able to accept a broad range of carotenoids, but their cleavage activity shows a strict selectivity towards the position of the double bond in the substrate. The initial aim of the project was to evaluate the in vitro activity of CsZCD, the enzyme identified as responsible of the zeaxanthin cleavage at the position 7 - 8 (7 ’, 8 ’) in Crocus sativus. Controversial data are reported in literature about the reproducibility of the enzymatic activity of this protein [124, 125] and, in 2014, a novel carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase, the Cs-CCD 2, was identified as the enzyme that cleaves the zeaxanthin at the 7 - 8 (7 ’- 8 ’) position in Crocus sativus [120]. We decided to include also this enzyme of more recent identification into our study. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the ZCD and the novel CCD 2, exploring their potential as enzymes useful for biocatalytic processes. Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases are enzymes characterized by a low solubility and often they are studied as fusion protein, with glutathione s-transferase or thioredoxin as fusion-partners. In order to enhance the solubility of ZCD and CCD 2 from Crocus sativus and facilitate their purification, the recombinant form of these enzymes were tagged with the glutathione s-transferase and the thioredoxin. Although both the enzymes showed a high expression level in E. coli, they were purified with a very low yield. The activity of the purified proteins and the cell lysate of E. coli, expressing these enzymes, were tested in vitro. The enzymatic assay was carried out on the natural substrate of these enzyme, zeaxanthin, and the results were analysed by HPLC chromatography. The chromatographic profiles of the reactions did not show the formation of the cleavage products, the 3 -OH-β-apo- 8 ’-carotenal and crocetin dialdheyde, therefore the enzymatic cleavage activity was not detected. Our results led to the conclusion that the produced enzymes were inactive, probably due to an incorrect protein folding that led to a tertiary structure not functional for the enzymatic activity. ...|$|E

Several simulations using finite element methods were used to obtain the best possible default parameters for <b>the</b> <b>tests.</b> <b>The</b> <b>residual</b> stress and <b>the</b> plastic deformation during roller burnishing were major parameters that were tested. </p...|$|R
40|$|Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) {{performed}} {{experiments on}} qualification material {{for use in}} the Interim Salt Disposition Program (ISDP) Batch 7 processing. The Marcrobatch 7 material was received with visible fine particulate solids, atypical for these samples. The as received material was allowed to settle for a period greater than 24 hours. The supernatant was then decanted and utilized as our clarified feed material. As part of this qualification work, SRNL performed an Actinide Removal Process (ARP) <b>test</b> using <b>the</b> clarified feed material. From this <b>test,</b> <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> monosodium titanate (MST) was analyzed for radionuclide uptake after filtration from H-Tank Farm (HTF) feed salt solution. The results of these analyses are reported and are within historical precedent...|$|R
30|$|An {{important}} specification <b>test</b> of <b>the</b> above {{equation is}} of stationarity in <b>the</b> resulting <b>residuals,</b> indicating <b>the</b> {{presence of a}} cointegrating relationship between the dependent and independent variables. This test consists of a unit-root (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) <b>test</b> on <b>the</b> <b>residuals,</b> under <b>the</b> null hypothesis {{that there is a}} unit root in <b>the</b> <b>residuals</b> (i.e., no cointegration). The absence of cointegration would mean that the equation is mis-specified and risks yielding a spurious regression with apparently (but not actually) statistically-significant results.|$|R
40|$|A data {{weighting}} method for combining different geodetic data based on statistical <b>tests</b> of <b>the</b> <b>residuals</b> is discussed. By requiring <b>the</b> <b>residuals</b> of combination solution {{to be white}} Gaussian as a sample of random noise, the relative weight factors can be determined internally, independent of external comparisons. To achieve this goal and to assess the solution, the Pearson chi(2) and higher-order moments of residuals are used to measure quantitatively the discrepancies between <b>the</b> <b>residuals</b> and white Gaussian noise...|$|R

The result is used to examine <b>the</b> Bartlett-Lawley <b>test</b> that <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> population canonical correlation coefficients are zero. A marginal likelihood function for the population coefficients is obtained and the maximum marginal likelihood estimates are shown to provide a bias correction...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} fully {{data-driven}} selection algorithm for the stopping criterion for MLEM reconstructions in PET. The method can be generalized to various other reconstruction algorithms, {{and is based on}} a statistical analysis of <b>the</b> <b>residuals</b> between projected model and data. To this end we <b>test</b> whether <b>the</b> <b>residuals</b> are consistent with the hypothesis of being solely due to Poisson noise. Moreover, our method includes a multiresolution approach, i. e. we <b>test</b> whether <b>the</b> <b>residuals</b> are consistent with pure Poisson noise for all possible re-binning of the data into increasing bin sizes in the detector space, at all positions. Unlike previous methods, this method is robust in the presence of model uncertainty in the system matrix. Technically, our method is based on the almost sure limiting behaviour of partial sums of <b>the</b> <b>residuals.</b> <b>The</b> <b>test</b> statistic includes a rate function which appears in the corresponding almost sure limit theorem for Poisson noise, and which is different from the Gaussian noise case. Finally, we present results from a Monte Carlo study which demonstrates the performance of the method. Copyright line will be provided by the publisher...|$|R
40|$|Impact and {{compression}} after impact {{characteristics of}} a typical plain weave fabric E-glass/epoxy composite have been studied for plates with different thicknesses and the same incident impact energy. Impact studies {{have been carried out}} on an instrumented drop weight impact test apparatus. Post-impact compressive strength has been obtained using NASA 1142 test fixture. Compressive strength of an unnotched specimen has been obtained using Lockheed test fixture with modified specimen geometry. Power fits for peak contact force and maximum plate displacement have been given as a function of plate thickness. It is observed that the impact damage area has quasi-lemniscate shape. Further, damage mechanism has been studied during <b>the</b> post-impact compressive <b>testing.</b> <b>The</b> <b>residual</b> compressive strength as a function of a plate thickness has been obtained...|$|R
