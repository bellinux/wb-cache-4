But the main thing I have to tell you is,--that art must not be <b>talked</b> <b>about.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> there is talk about it at all, signifies that it is ill done, or cannot be done. No true painter ever speaks, or ever has spoken, much of his art. The {{greatest}} speak nothing. Even Reynolds is no exception, for he wrote of all that he could not himself do, and was utterly silent respecting all that he himself did.|$|E

50|$|Typically, {{the success}} of a film is {{calculated}} in US dollars, which are paid by the visitors at the box office. The short film, produced not for profit at the box office, showed its success a few years later. The film {{is one of the reasons}} why Montreal has become one of the global centers of the computer game industry. Tony de Peltrie was created with mainframe computers. This was complicated because every change had to be reprogrammed. Philippe Bergeron told 2012 in a video how tedious and frustrating this work was. He <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Daniel Langlois also so saw it and had spoken of wanting to change that. After the completion of the film, therefore, Langlois worked with two programmers to create a new program, and founded the company Softimage in Montreal. The program Softimage 3D and its further developments advanced in the 1990s to become an industry standard.|$|E

One is a race to the bottom – local authorities undercutting their competitors and undermining tax basis. The other fears relate to the opposite scenario, a `race to the top'. Would some councils set very high tax rates and waste the revenues on useless programmes and bureaucracy? Would these very high tax rates bring more pain to firms already struggling {{in the face of the}} recession? Some of my recent research, published in the Economic Journal this week, provides evidence that this fear is to some extent justified...|$|E
