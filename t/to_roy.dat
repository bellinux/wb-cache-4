In the season's finale, Jim, Karen, and Michael interview for a corporate position {{that turns out to}} be Jan's, who is fired that day for poor performance.

The dispute led to what has been described as one of the largest mailbags that the Bristol Evening Post had ever received, with contributors writing in support of both sides of the issue.|$|E

Pam then tells the camera she is happy with her life now, and that they do not even make her dream house in Scranton. She then breaks down and cries in front of the camera.

On its opening drive of overtime Forcier led Michigan down to the 8-yard line but then threw a tipped interception in the end zone, ending their threat.

5|$|Nash's {{football}} career {{continued to}} soar as several Victorian Football League clubs sought to recruit Laurie and Robert Junior. South Melbourne, partly through its connection <b>to</b> <b>Roy</b> Cazaly and partly through its offer to Nash of an unprecedented £3 per match, accommodation {{and a job}} in a sports store, eventually won the battle for the Nash brothers' signatures for the 1933 VFL season. Such was the interest in Melbourne in where Nash would play, when South Melbourne committee member Joe Scanlan travelled to Tasmania to sign Nash, he was smuggled aboard the steamer to avoid media attention.|$|E
5|$|The series {{begins by}} mostly {{introducing}} the office's workers via a tour given by branch manager Michael Scott {{for both the}} camera crew and a first-day temp (Ryan Howard). The audience learns salesman Jim Halpert has a crush on receptionist Pam Beesly (who helps him play pranks on co-worker Dwight Schrute), {{even though she is}} engaged <b>to</b> <b>Roy</b> (who works in the building's lower-level warehouse). News spreads throughout the office that Dunder Mifflin's corporate headquarters is planning to downsize an entire branch, leading to general anxiety, but Michael chooses to deny or downplay the realities of the situation in order to maintain employee morale.|$|E

5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) has {{everyone}} stay late {{to cover}} for their co-workers in Florida, which turns into an awkward situation when Val's (Ameenah Kaplan) boyfriend, Brandon (Jerry Minor), arrives and accuses Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) of {{having an affair with}} her, after having read Darryl's text messages to her. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) demands that Darryl read them aloud out of voyeuristic interest. Upon hearing them, most of the staff agree that his text messages, particularly an extended ellipsis at the end of one, are suggestive of Darryl wanting to be with Val. Val protests that the idea of her being romantically involved with Darryl is ridiculous. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) suggests that he try a bold step, saying that if Jim had not made romantic advances while she was still engaged <b>to</b> <b>Roy,</b> she never would have ended up marrying him. Darryl follows her advice and tells Val that a potential relationship is not ridiculous.|$|E
