30|$|To {{explore the}} {{robustness}} of the results, we conducted the following post hoc sensitivity analyses: For all outcomes, we excluded <b>trials</b> <b>that</b> used per-protocol analysis, trials published in abstract form, <b>trials</b> <b>that</b> did not explicitly blind patients and healthcare personnel, <b>trials</b> <b>that</b> administered control formulae containing omega- 3, and <b>trials</b> <b>that</b> did not administer {{the control group}} a placebo feed. For the mortality outcome, we excluded trials in which eligibility for inclusion was unclear (based on ICU admission), and further explored odds ratio (OR) {{as an alternative to}} RR analysis. For the ICU LOS outcome, we excluded <b>trials</b> <b>that</b> did not directly report SDs. Lastly for the DMV outcome, we excluded <b>trials</b> <b>that</b> did not directly report SDs and <b>trials</b> <b>that</b> did not stratify randomization by mechanical ventilation.|$|R

For the mortality outcome, exclusion of trials in which ICU admission was unclear [39], trials published in abstract form [32], trials without explicit blinding of patients and healthcare personnel [25, 29 – 31, 33, 37, 39 – 43], and <b>trials</b> <b>that</b> did not administer the control group a placebo feed [25, 29, 33, 41] yielded similar non-significant results.|$|R

5|$|At a {{preliminary}} hearing on June 19, Judge Robert Taylor set a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of illegal possession of narcotics, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. While {{there was no question}} as to whether the drugs were in Hendrix's luggage, in order for the Crown to prove possession they had to show that he knew they were there. In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage or needle tracks on his arms. After a <b>trial</b> <b>that</b> lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for 8 hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{these initial}} prosecutions, the ecclesia {{attacked}} Pericles himself by {{asking him to}} justify his ostensible profligacy with, and maladministration of, public money. According to Plutarch, Pericles was so afraid of the oncoming <b>trial</b> <b>that</b> he did not let the Athenians yield to the Lacedaemonians. Beloch also believes that Pericles deliberately brought on the war to protect his political position at home. Thus, {{at the start of}} the Peloponnesian War, Athens found itself in the awkward position of entrusting its future to a leader whose pre-eminence had just been seriously shaken for the first time in over a decade.|$|E
40|$|Background: A randomized, {{controlled}} trial (RCT) {{should not}} be started or interpreted without accounting for evidence from pre-ceding RCTs addressing the same question. Research has suggested that evidence from prior trials is often not accounted for in reports of subsequent RCTs. Objective: To assess {{the extent to which}} reports of RCTs cite prior trials studying the same interventions. Design: Meta-analyses published in 2004 that combined 4 or more trials were identified; within each meta-analysis, the extent to which each trial report cited the <b>trials</b> <b>that</b> preceded it by more than 1 year was assessed. Measurements: The proportion of prior <b>trials</b> <b>that</b> were cited (prior research citation index), the proportion of the total participants from prior <b>trials</b> <b>that</b> were in the cited trials (sample size citation index), and the absolute number of trials cited were calculated...|$|R
