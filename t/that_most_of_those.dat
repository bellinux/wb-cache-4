5|$|The {{number of}} African Americans in the {{territory}} during this period was quite small but not insignificant. Newcomers continued to bring slaves with them, but there were many free blacks as well, some working as servants and some as completely independent pioneers. Information about the black immigrants during the earlier periods is sparse, but records do show <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> at Fort Snelling were slaves. Records from 1850 indicate a population of 39 free blacks {{out of a total}} population of 6,077 citizens {{in the territory}} (which excluded Native American tribes). Before the 1840s these free persons could often expect to be treated equal to other racial groups. By the time Minnesota had achieved statehood, however, blacks had been disenfranchised and schools were segregated. Despite this, {{from the start of the}} Minnesota Territory in 1848 the leadership was predominantly antislavery thus ending the practice in this era.|$|E

25|$|The Human Security Report Project (HSRP) of Simon Fraser University has {{challenged}} the toll of 5.4 million war-related deaths between 1998 and 2008. It states {{that of the}} IRC's five periodical estimates two that comprise a period from 1998-2001 are flawed, and the reported 2.6 million deaths within should not {{be included in the}} total death toll. The other three periodical IRC estimates comprise a period from May 2001-April 2007, and in which 2.83 million of the total 5.4 million deaths were reported. The HSRP argued that the estimates were built on a general death rate that was far too low for Congo, and <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> people would have most likely died anyway. Thus, the IRC figure should be revised to 860,000 total war-related excess deaths.|$|E
25|$|It {{was later}} {{revealed}} that Pallop's order to storm the mosque contravened a direct order by Defense Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh {{to seek a}} peaceful resolution to the stand-off {{no matter how long}} it took. Pallop was immediately ordered out of the area, and later tendered his resignation as commander of the Southern Peace Enhancement Center. The forward command of the Internal Security Operations Command (ISOC), which Pallop headed, was also dissolved. A government investigative commission found that the security forces had over-reacted. The Asian Centre for Human Rights questioned the independence and impartiality of the investigative commission.

50|$|Some {{constituencies}} elect {{only six}} or seven MPs, resulting in a high election threshold for a given party, favouring large parties and reducing the proportionality of the result. Because of this, the party leader of the Greens, Tarja Cronberg, lost her seat {{in the district of}} Northern Karelia, the party's only one, despite their getting 11.7% of the vote there. Her case, made seemingly even more unfair by her impressive personal total of 7,802 votes, greater than <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> elected, has been held up in the media {{as a symbol of the}} flaws in the present system.

25|$|Havel's {{popularity}} abroad surpassed {{his popularity}} at home, {{and he was}} often the object of controversy and criticism. During his time in office, Havel stated that the expulsion of the indigenous Sudeten German population after World War II was immoral, causing a great controversy at home. He also extended general amnesty {{as one of his}} first acts as President, in an attempt to lessen the pressure in overcrowded prisons as well as to release political prisoners and persons who may have been falsely imprisoned during the Communist era. Havel felt that many of the decisions of the previous regime's courts should not be trusted, and <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> in prison had not received fair trials. On the other hand, his critics claimed that this amnesty led to {{a significant increase in the}} crime rate: the total number of crimes had doubled, as well as the number of committed murders. Several of the worst crimes in the history of the Czech criminology were committed by criminals released on this amnesty. Within four years since the Velvet revolution (and following another two amnesties declared by Havel) the criminality more than tripled in comparison with 1989. According to Havel's memoir To the Castle and Back, most of those who were released had less than a year to serve before their sentences ended, but statistics contradict Havel's claims.|$|E

500|$|Although they {{retained}} {{respect for}} each other, Hergé's repeated absences had created a tense situation between himself and Leblanc. After a lengthy search, Leblanc had found a publisher willing to produce an edition of Tintin magazine in France: Georges Dargaud's Le Lombard, which began production of a French edition in October 1948. However, Hergé was unhappy that Leblanc had appointed André Frenez as Van Melkebeke's replacement as editor-in-chief, describing Frenez as [...] "a cold functionary". Hergé was stubborn and uncompromising as the magazine's artistic director, known for strongly criticising the work of old friends like Pierre Ickx if he felt {{that they did not}} meet his exacting standards. He was particularly critical of the work of two of the newly hired staff at Tintin and Kuifje, Jacques Martin and Willy Vandersteen, encouraging them to change their artistic style to better reflect his own preferences. To Leblanc, he expressed the concern <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> working at Tintin were better illustrators than storytellers. He also opined that Tintin was not keeping up with the times and what he perceived as the increased maturity of children, encouraging the magazine to better reflect current events and scientific developments.|$|E

Southern's Review {{was to have been}} published by Longman, and that firm, though part proprietors of the Edinburgh, were willing to be the publishers of the new journal. But when all the arrangements had been made, and the prospectuses sent out, the Longmans saw my father's attack on the Edinburgh, and drew back. My father was now appealed to for his interest with his own publisher, Baldwin, which was exerted with a successful result.

500|$|Cameron's {{life was}} brought to wider {{attention}} through the publication of two biographies about Parsons: John Carter's Sex and Rockets and George Pendle's Strange Angel. A dramatization of Parsons' life was depicted in the play Moonchild, performed at The Access Theatre on Broadway in 2004. Cameron was portrayed by Heather Tom. In 2011, Wormwood Star, a biography of Cameron authored by the Briton Spencer Kansa, was published, {{though it was not}} authorized by the Cameron–Parsons Foundation. Kansa had spent almost three years in the U.S. researching the book, interviewing many of those who knew Cameron, including several who died shortly after.

500|$|Succeeding Gielgud {{as leading}} {{man at the}} Old Vic, Richardson had a varied season, in which there were {{conspicuous}} successes interspersed with critical failures. James Agate was not convinced by him as the domineering Petruchio in The Taming of the Shrew; in Julius Caesar the whole cast received tepid reviews. In Othello Richardson divided the critics. He emphasised the plausible charm of the murderous Iago {{to a degree that}} Agate thought [...] "very good Richardson, but indifferent Shakespeare", whereas The Times said, [...] "He never stalked or hissed like a plain villain, and, in fact, we have seldom seen a man smile and smile and be a villain so adequately." [...] His biggest success of the season was as Bottom in A Midsummer Night's Dream. Both Agate and Darlington commented on how the actor transformed the character from the bumbling workman to the magically changed creature on whom Titania dotes. Agate wrote <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who had played the part hitherto [...] "seem to have thought Bottom, with the ass's head on, was the same Bottom, only funnier. Shakespeare says he was 'translated', and Mr Richardson translated him." [...] With Sybil Thorndike as a guest star and Richardson as Ralph, The Knight of the Burning Pestle was a hit with audiences and critics, as was a revival of Twelfth Night, with Edith Evans as Viola and Richardson again playing Sir Toby, finishing the season to renewed praise.|$|E
500|$|The authorities, {{with the}} pretext of the events, claimed that the Venelizelists had staged an insurrection {{with the support of}} Allied troops and {{proceeded}} {{with the help of the}} Reservists to extensive arrests and reprisals against the city's Venizelists. The entire operation was led by two generals of the army; troops of the military district of Athens took orders from General K. Kallaris and the soldiers of the active defense were commanded by General A. Papoulas (later commander-in-chief of the Asia Minor expedition). The terror and destruction that followed soon went out of hand, making even the respectable conservative newspaper Politiki Epitheorisis ( [...] , Political Review) that at the beginning urged Greek [...] "justice" [...] to [...] "smite mercifully the atrocious conspiracy" [...] and to purge all followers of the [...] "archconspirator of Salonika [...] ", in the end to urge [...] "prudence". During the following three days houses and shops of Venizelists were ransacked and 35 people were murdered. Chester says <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who were murdered were refugees from Asia Minor. Many hundreds were imprisoned and kept in solitary confinement. Karolidis characterizes the imprisonment of certain prominent Venizelists, such as Emmanuel Benakis (mayor of Athens), as a disgrace. Some authors argue that Benakis was not only arrested and imprisoned but also disrespected and ill-treated. Seligman describes that they were only released 45 days later after a strong demand contained within the Entente ultimatum, which was accepted on 16 January. Opposing reports also exist, e.g. Abbot asserts that during the evacuation of the Allied forces, many [...] "criminals" [...] and [...] "collaborators" [...] on the payrolls of different Allied spy agencies slipped out of Athens at night after allegedly [...] "terrorizing the city for nearly a year". Due to his failure Vice-admiral Dartige du Fournet was relieved of his command.|$|E
