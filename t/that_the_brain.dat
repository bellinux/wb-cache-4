5|$|Another {{topic is}} the {{relationship}} between brain structures and language acquisition. Research in first language acquisition has already established that infants from all linguistic environments go through similar and predictable stages (such as babbling), and some neurolinguistics research attempts to find correlations between stages of language development and stages of brain development, while other research investigates the physical changes (known as neuroplasticity) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> undergoes during second language acquisition, when adults learn a new language.|$|E
5|$|Sleep {{involves}} great {{changes in}} brain activity. Until the 1950s {{it was generally}} believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> essentially shuts off during sleep, but this is now known to be far from true; activity continues, but patterns become very different. There {{are two types of}} sleep: REM sleep (with dreaming) and NREM (non-REM, usually without dreaming) sleep, which repeat in slightly varying patterns throughout a sleep episode. Three broad types of distinct brain activity patterns can be measured: REM, light NREM and deep NREM. During deep NREM sleep, also called slow wave sleep, activity in the cortex takes the form of large synchronized waves, whereas in the waking state it is noisy and desynchronized. Levels of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin drop during slow wave sleep, and fall almost to zero during REM sleep; levels of acetylcholine show the reverse pattern.|$|E
5|$|The Moon {{has long}} been {{associated}} with insanity and irrationality; the words lunacy and lunatic (popular shortening loony) are derived from the Latin name for the Moon, Luna. Philosophers Aristotle and Pliny the Elder argued that the full moon induced insanity in susceptible individuals, believing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain,</b> which is mostly water, must {{be affected by the}} Moon and its power over the tides, but the Moon's gravity is too slight to affect any single person. Even today, people who believe in a lunar effect claim that admissions to psychiatric hospitals, traffic accidents, homicides or suicides increase during a full moon, but dozens of studies invalidate these claims.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} well {{established}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> unconscious plays {{a vital role in}} perception and data analysis. The numerous examples of optical illusions, hallucinations and other tricks <b>that</b> <b>the</b> unconscious <b>brain</b> plays on <b>the</b> conscious <b>brain</b> provide ample evidence of the active role of the unconscious mind during data gathering and analysis. Several experiments have been performed to show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> unconscious <b>brain</b> is able to gather data at a much faster rate than <b>the</b> conscious <b>brain</b> and also <b>that</b> <b>the</b> unconscious <b>brain</b> filters out a great amount of information and can use this information to influence cognitive decision making processes.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{research into}} thinking machines {{was inspired by}} a confluence of ideas that became prevalent in the late 30s, 40s and early 50s. Recent research in neurology had shown <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> was an electrical network of neurons that fired in all-or-nothing pulses. Norbert Wiener's cybernetics described control and stability in electrical networks. Claude Shannon's information theory described digital signals (i.e., all-or-nothing signals). Alan Turing's theory of computation showed that any form of computation could be described digitally. The close relationship between these ideas suggested that {{it might be possible to}} construct an electronic brain.|$|E
5|$|The {{severity}} of the injury is an important aspect in determining how much sexual function returns as a person recovers. According to the American Spinal Injury Association grading scale, an incomplete SCI {{is one in which}} some amount of sensation or motor function is preserved in the rectum. This indicates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> can still send and receive some messages to the lowest parts of the spinal cord, beyond the damaged area. In people with incomplete injury, {{some or all of the}} spinal tracts involved in sexual responses remain intact, allowing, for example, orgasms like those of uninjured people. In men, having an incomplete injury improves chances of being able to achieve erections and orgasms over those with complete injuries.|$|E
5|$|As a {{side effect}} of the {{electrochemical}} processes used by neurons for signaling, brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active. When large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity, the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull, using electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG). EEG recordings, along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats, show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> of a living animal is constantly active, even during sleep. Each part of the brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity, which may vary according to behavioral state. In mammals, the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves during sleep, faster alpha waves when the animal is awake but inattentive, and chaotic-looking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a task. During an epileptic seizure, the brain's inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels, producing EEG traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain. Relating these population-level patterns to the computational functions of individual neurons is a major focus of current research in neurophysiology.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fifth}} century BC, Alcmaeon of Croton in Magna Grecia, first {{considered}} the brain to be {{the seat of the}} mind. Also in {{the fifth century}} BC in Athens, Hippocrates believed the brain to be the seat of intelligence. Aristotle, in his biology initially believed the heart to be the seat of intelligence, and saw the brain as a cooling mechanism for the blood. He reasoned that humans are more rational than the beasts because, among other reasons, they have a larger brain to cool their hot-bloodedness. Aristotle did describe the meninges and distinguished between the cerebrum and cerebellum. Herophilus of Chalcedon in the fourth and third centuries BC distinguished the cerebrum and the cerebellum, and provided the first clear description of the ventricles; and with Erasistratus of Ceos experimented on living brains. Their works are now mostly lost, and we know about their achievements due mostly to secondary sources. Some of their discoveries had to be re-discovered a millennium after their deaths. Anatomist physician Galen in the second century AD, {{during the time of the}} Roman Empire, dissected the brains of sheep, monkeys, dogs, and pigs. He concluded that, as the cerebellum was denser than the brain, it must control the muscles, while as the cerebrum was soft, it must be where the senses were processed. Galen further theorized <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> functioned by movement of animal spirits through the ventricles.|$|E

25|$|The {{view that}} the heart {{was the source of}} {{consciousness}} was not challenged until the time of the Greek physician Hippocrates. He believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> was not only involved with sensation—since most specialized organs (e.g.,eyes, ears, tongue) are located in the head near the brain—but was also the seat of intelligence. Plato also speculated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> was the seat of the rational part of the soul. Aristotle, however, believed the heart was the center of intelligence and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> regulated the amount of heat from the heart. This view was generally accepted until the Roman physician Galen, a follower of Hippocrates and physician to Roman gladiators, observed that his patients lost their mental faculties when they had sustained damage to their brains.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} Bayesian {{integration}} {{is based on}} the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> must deal with a number of inputs, which vary in reliability. In dealing with these inputs, it must construct a coherent representation of the world that corresponds to reality. The Bayesian integration view is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> uses a form of Bayesian inference. This view has been backed up by computational modeling of such a Bayesian inference from signals to coherent representation, which shows similar characteristics to integration in the brain.|$|E

In brain tissue, atrophy describes a loss of neurons and the connections between them. Atrophy can be generalized, which means <b>that</b> all of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> has shrunk; or it can be focal, affecting only a limited area of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> and resulting in a decrease of <b>the</b> functions <b>that</b> area of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> controls.

50|$|The {{plasticity}} of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> and <b>the</b> rewiring {{of neural}} connections {{make it possible}} for one part of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> to take up the functions of a disabled part. Scientists have long known <b>that</b> <b>the</b> immature <b>brain</b> is generally more plastic than <b>the</b> mature <b>brain,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of children are better able to adapt and recover from injury than <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of adults. NINDS researchers are investigating the mechanisms underlying this difference and theorize that children have an overabundance of hard-wired neural networks, many of which naturally decrease through a process called neural pruning. When an injury destroys an important neural network in children, another less useful neural network that would have eventually died takes over the responsibilities of the damaged network. Some researchers are looking at the role of plasticity in memory, while others are using imaging technologies, such as functional MRI, to map regions of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> and record evidence of plasticity.|$|R
