At the very summit is a cone of stones, built by the shepherds, and called the Carrock Man. Such cones are on the tops of almost all our mountains, and they are all called [...] "men". At the bottom of the Carrock Man I seated myself for shelter, but the wind became so fearful and tyrannous, that I was apprehensive some of the stones might topple down upon me, so I groped my way farther down and came to three rocks, placed on this wise 1/3\2*** each one supported by the other like a child's house of cards, and in the hollow and screen which they made, I sate for a long while sheltered, as if I had been in my own study in which I am now writing: there I sate with a total feeling worshipping the power and [...] "eternal link" [...] of energy.

40|$|A case is {{described}} where a symmetrical polyarthritis followed a febrile illness due to Chlamydia psittaci infection. The arthritis abated after treatment with tetracosactrin. KEY WORDS: Psittacosis, Reactive arthritis. CHLAMYDIAL infections in animals commonly cause arthritis, {{but this has}} rarely been observed in humans (1). We report {{a young woman who}} developed psittacosis, complicated by a severe and persistent polyarthritis. CASE HISTORY A 36 -year-old woman, with a past history of thyrotoxicosis treated with carbimazole, developed sudden onset of myalgias, fever and heavy sweats. She also complained of mild headache, but had no respiratory symptoms. Twelve days after the illness began, she developed pain and swelling of the right knee, and subsequently arthritis affecting multiple joints. Initial examination revealed her to be unwell, with a temperature of 40 °C, but no rash or lymphadenopathy and no abnormal cardio-respiratory or abdominal findings. Her muscles were tender, but power was not reduced.

30|$|In April 2010, a 69 -year-old woman {{presented}} to our hospital {{with pain and}} swelling in <b>the</b> <b>small</b> joints <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hands for the past 2  months. The laboratory examination revealed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; 31  mm/h) and C-reactive protein (CRP; 1.69  mg/L) level. Her rheumatoid factor (RF) and anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) levels were 215.4 and 51.1  IU/mL, respectively. Subsequent radiography showed interstitial pneumonia (nonspecific interstitial pneumonia [NSIP] pattern), which was suggestive of RA. From these findings, the patient was diagnosed with RA according to the 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) RA Classification Criteria (8 points total: joint involvement 3 points, serology 3 points, acute-phase reactants 1 point, duration of symptoms 1 point). RA treatment was initiated with 1, 000  mg/day salazosulfapyridine (SASP), which improved her clinical symptoms and laboratory findings. Based on the clinical course, however, SASP was not sufficiently effective after 1  year of treatment; consequently, the treatment was supplemented with 3  mg/day tacrolimus. Subsequently, her articular symptoms and laboratory inflammatory findings resolved.|$|R

The Storia di Angiolo e Laura is written in a simple and direct style, close to Orvieto’s other work.

40|$|Winifred Knights, 1899 - 1947, was {{a student}} at the Slade School of Art from 1915, where she {{developed}} a decorative manner of rhythmic, repetitive forms, one form of cautious modernism. In 1920 she was the first woman to win the Rome Prize in Decorative Painting. The award was for three years at the British School at Rome. Knights often chose to base her paintings on biblical subjects, or the lives of saints. She was not religious and I argue that these stories, which were well-known in Britain at the time, were vehicles to represent the lives of women and families in the unsettled years during and after WWI. Many women artists have depicted domestic scenes, but Knights chose the exterior and multi-figure compositions, including many self-portraits. She used these compositions to explore women‟s vulnerability, rebellion against male control, maternity and the self-sufficiency of a women‟s community. Personal material is present in all her work and much of it deals with the traumas she suffered. My thesis argues that her paintings‟ engagement with the viewer is not restricted by this material: the themes she explored resonated with contemporaneous viewers, as they do today. The argument closely examines Winifred Knights‟ paintings, including their art historical sources. It draws on her correspondence and on the social conditions of Britain and Italy. <b>The</b> <b>small</b> number <b>of</b> <b>her</b> oil paintings is no measure of Knights‟ success as artist and woman. Indeed, the many dimensions of life as artist, woman, mother and wife were important to Knights. While previous studies of women artists have regarded biography as artistic source material or distraction, I argue that it is central to understanding Knights and her contexts. This thesis therefore argues that the many aspects of a complete life fed into Knights‟ painting and can be seen in <b>her</b> sensitive depictions <b>of</b> women‟s lives...|$|R
