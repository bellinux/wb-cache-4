5|$|Titan Quest {{begins with}} a narration, {{detailing}} how the Titans once ruled the primordial darkness before {{the light of the}} Olympian Gods appeared: after a great war, the Titans were exiled and imprisoned, and the Olympians ushered in a golden age for the mortal world. An unknown time later, a trio of lesser Titans known as Telkines broke the communication conduit linking Olympus with the mortal world, and summoned armies of monsters to terrorize the world and prepare for the release of the Titans. The player character begins their quest at the village of Helos, where beasts are destroying the local crops. Fighting their way through Greece, they learn of Telkines from a group called the Order of Prometheus. After defeating the first Telkine beneath the palace of Knossos, the player then travels to Egypt and attempts to restore the connection between Earth and Olympus. The ritual fails, and they must defeat a second Telkine. The player then pursues the final Telkine along the Silk Road to China. Pursuing the Telkine to the Wusou Mountains, the player is too late to prevent the release of the Titan Typhon, who travels to Olympus to destroy the gods. After the player defeats Typhon, Zeus speaks to the player, telling them that <b>they,</b> <b>a</b> human champion, have proved humanity can live without the protection of Olympus.|$|E

25|$|You {{hear a lot}} {{of third}} baseman raving about the hard chances they get, but any time the shortstop is looking for a berth that is nice and quiet and restful in {{comparison}} to his own he casts longing glances at third. Look up the records and see what becomes of the shortstops who get too old to cover all the ground between second base and the foul line. A lot of them camp on third for a while. And why shouldn't <b>they?</b> <b>A</b> man can play third when he can't play short. That's a cinch.|$|E
25|$|Some natural {{questions}} are: {{under what}} circumstances does this formalism work, and for what operators L are expansions in series of other operators like this possible? Can any function f be {{expressed in terms of}} the eigenfunctions (are <b>they</b> <b>a</b> Schauder basis) and {{under what circumstances}} does a point spectrum or a continuous spectrum arise? How do the formalisms for infinite-dimensional spaces and finite-dimensional spaces differ, or do they differ? Can these ideas be extended to a broader class of spaces? Answering such questions is the realm of spectral theory and requires considerable background in functional analysis and matrix algebra.|$|E
25|$|After {{most of the}} Syrian {{countryside}} was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate {{during the}} reign of Caliph Umar, Damascus itself was conquered by the Muslim-Arab general Khalid ibn al-Walid in August - September 634 AD. His army had previously attempted to capture the city in April 634, but without success. With Damascus now in Muslim-Arab hands, the Byzantines, alarmed at the loss of their most prestigious city in the Near East, had decided to wrest back control of it. Under Emperor Heraclius, the Byzantines fielded an army superior to that of the Rashidun in manpower. They advanced into southern Syria during the spring of 636 and consequently Khalid ibn al-Walid's forces withdrew from Damascus to prepare for renewed confrontation. In August, the two sides met along the Yarmouk River where <b>they</b> <b>a</b> fought a major battle which ended in a decisive Muslim victory, solidifying Muslim rule in Syria and Palestine.|$|E

500|$|Taylor summoned Khánh to his office, but the Vietnamese leader sent Thi, Kỳ, Thiệu and Admiral Chung Tấn Cang, the {{commander}} of the Republic of Vietnam Navy, instead. Taylor asked the four to sit down and then said [...] "Do all of you understand English?" [...] The ambassador then angrily denounced the officers. According to Stanley Karnow, Taylor [...] "launched into a tirade, scolding them as if he were still superintendent of West Point and <b>they</b> <b>a</b> group of cadets caught cheating". He said [...] "I told you all clearly at General Westmoreland's dinner we Americans were tired of coups. Apparently I wasted my words." [...] He decried the removal of the HNC as [...] "totally illegal", and said it had [...] "destroyed the government-making process", and that [...] "I made it clear that all the military plans I know you would like to carry out are dependent on government stability", something he felt had been lost with the dismissal of the HNC. He said [...] "...you have made a real mess. We cannot carry you forever if you do things like this." [...] Taylor believed the HNC to be {{an essential part of the}} government, because as an American, he believed civilian legitimacy was a must. For him, the HNC was a necessary step in a progression towards an elected civilian legislature, which he regarded as critical for national and military morale. The historian Mark Moyar regarded Taylor's intervention as unnecessary, and noted that there had been many instances of fierce fighting in Vietnamese history despite the complete absence of democracy throughout the nation's history. Taylor also reminded them of an earlier meeting where he had discussed an American plan to expand the war, increase funding for the South Vietnamese military, and to go on the offensive against the communists at the request of Khánh. Taylor said the Americans would not be able to help Saigon pursue their desired military strategy if the political machinations did not stop. Taylor said that if the military did not transfer some powers or advisory capacity back to the HNC or another civilian institution, aid would be withheld, and some planned military operations against the Ho Chi Minh trail—which was being used to infiltrate communists into the south—would be suspended.|$|E
