5|$|In July 1892, Curtis sent a {{photograph}} of the Lotto painting to Leech, who consulted with Barber and replied that the engraver could not work from a painting in which the subject faces forward. So that Barber could depict Columbus in profile, Curtis arranged for a little-known Washington, D.C. sculptor, Ulric Stonewall Jackson Dunbar, to create a bust based on the painting at the Company's expense; when complete it was forwarded to Barber in Philadelphia. Barber prepared sketches based on the bust on August 15, and presented them to Acting Mint Director Robert E. Preston (Leech was on vacation), who forwarded them to fair authorities in Chicago. Ellsworth showed them to artists working on the exposition, and to the press. The artistic reaction was negative, and the newspapers suggested that the sketches resembled more a long-haired professor than the celebrated mariner. This controversy, coupled with his anger from public debate over whether the painting actually was of Columbus, caused Ellsworth <b>to</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>permission</b> for his painting to be used.|$|E

500|$|American singer-songwriter and parodist [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic {{had sought}} {{permission}} from Gaga to parody [...] "Born This Way", providing {{a brief description}} of the concept for his song. Her management responded that she must hear the song before providing approval. Yankovic obliged with the lyrics of [...] "Perform This Way", which was released on April 25, 2011, as the first single from his thirteenth studio album, Alpocalypse, on iTunes Store. After what Yankovic described as [...] "considerable expense" [...] in writing, recording, and mastering the song in the studio, he contacted Gaga's management again with a completed recording of the song. He was subsequently refused permission, without Gaga listening to the track and Yankovic getting the impression that the refusal came from the singer herself. Left with a completed song and abandoned plans for an outlandish music video to promote the song and album, Yankovic released it on YouTube. It was then that Gaga actually heard the song, and personally contacted Yankovic, giving him green light to include the song on Alpocalypse, telling him that her manager had been the one <b>to</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>permission,</b> which was done without her knowledge or input.|$|E
2500|$|The UK {{copyright}} originally expired {{at the end}} of 1987 (50 {{years after}} Barrie's death) but later revived in 1995 when legislation was changed following the directive to harmonise copyright laws within the EU, which extended the copyright term to 70 years after the author's death. However, in 1988, former Prime Minister James Callaghan sponsored an amendment to a Parliamentary Bill granting the hospital a right to royalties in perpetuity for any performance, publication, broadcast [...] of the play or adaptation of the play. The bill does not grant the hospital full intellectual property rights over the work such as creative control over the use of the material or the right <b>to</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>permission</b> to use it. It [...] does not cover the Peter Pan section of The Little White Bird, which predates the play and is not therefore an [...] "adaptation" [...] of it. The exact phrasing is in section 301 of, and Schedule 6 to, the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988:301. The provisions of Schedule 6 have effect for conferring on trustees {{for the benefit of the}} Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, London, a right to a royalty in respect of the public performance, commercial publication, broadcasting or inclusion in a cable programme service of the play 'Peter Pan' by Sir James Matthew Barrie, or of any adaptation of that work, notwithstanding that copyright in the work expired on 31 December 1987.|$|E

Residents protest in November.|$|E
