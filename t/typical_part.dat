2500|$|The term [...] "Rastafari" [...] {{derives from}} the pre-regnal title of Haile Selassie; the term [...] "Ras" [...] means a duke or prince, while [...] "Tafari Makonen" [...] was his name. It is unknown why the early Rastas adopted this form of Haile Selassie's name {{as the basis of}} their religion's name. Many commentators—including some {{academic}} sources—refer to the movement as [...] "Rastafarianism". This term has also been used by some practitioners. However, [...] "Rastafarianism" [...] is considered offensive by most Rastafari, who, being critical of [...] "isms" [...] or [...] "ians" [...] (which they see as a <b>typical</b> <b>part</b> of [...] "Babylon" [...] culture), dislike being labelled as an [...] "ism" [...] or [...] "ian" [...] themselves. Cashmore urged fellow academics not to use this term, which he described as [...] "insensitive".|$|E

40|$|To search a bionic {{prototype}} for simple fabrication of superhydrophobic surface, the wettability of water droplets on <b>typical</b> <b>parts</b> of body surface in locust Locusta migratoria manilensis is measured, and micromorphology of these <b>typical</b> <b>parts</b> are detailedly examined with a {{scanning electron microscope}} and a scanning white light interferometer. Based on Wenzel model and Cassie-Baxter model, the hydrophobic mechanism of these <b>typical</b> <b>parts</b> is analyzed briefly. Results present that the contact angles of water droplets on these <b>typical</b> <b>parts</b> change obviously, as exhibiting the greatest value of (132. 92 ± 4. 73) ° on internal wings and the smallest value of (119. 47 ± 4. 32) ° on external wings, whereas the neck surface and the mouthpart surface presenting rather similar contact angle values. SEM and SWLI observations show that the surface of external wings distributes ~ 100 μm scaled ridge-like convexes and nano scaled wax coverings, and the surface of internal wings consists of milli-micro scaled ridge-like convexes and numerous micro-nano scaled mastoids. Both the neck surface and mouthpart surface show undulate structures with milli-micro ranged parameters, whereas present rather smooth micromorphology when examining a rather small area. The surface of internal wings possesses the dual structures consisting of ridge-like convexes and numerous mastoids, thus it makes water droplet to generate the Cassie-Baxter contact state and consequently exhibit great contact angles. Other <b>typical</b> <b>parts</b> of the locust's body surface possess the microstructures to make water droplet to generate the Wenzel contact state and thereby exhibit relatively smaller contact angles. The obtained conclusion can quantitatively describe the wettability of <b>typical</b> <b>parts</b> in locust body surface, as well as provides a theoretical foundation for developing bioinspired materials with hydrophobic properties and self-cleaning abilities...|$|R
