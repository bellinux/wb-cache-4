5|$|The Ilyushin Il-30 was a Soviet turbojet-powered {{tactical}} bomber {{designed as}} a higher-performance, swept wing version of the Ilyushin Il-28, in the late 1940s. Its thin wing and engine nacelles necessitated the use of <b>tandem</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear,</b> the first Soviet aircraft to do so. It was apparently canceled before the prototype made its first flight, although sources disagree with this.|$|E
5|$|The Harrier II {{retains the}} <b>tandem</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> {{layout of the}} first-generation Harriers, {{although}} each outrigger landing gear leg was moved from the wingtip to mid-span for a tighter turning radius when taxiing. The engine intakes are larger {{than those of the}} first-generation Harrier, and have a revised inlet. On the underside of the fuselage, McDonnell Douglas added lift-improvement devices, which capture the reflected engine exhaust when close to the ground, giving the equivalent of up to 1,200lb (544kg) of extra lift.|$|E
5|$|A second I-215 {{was built}} to an order from OKB-1 as the I-215D (dooblyor, second prototype), to {{evaluate}} the bicycle or <b>tandem</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> configuration. It used wider-diameter paired wheels in a tandem arrangement that retracted into the fuselage, along with small outrigger wheels under the engine nacelles which retracted into fairings. The main undercarriage of the I-215D also incorporated a kneeling feature which could increase the incidence of the aircraft by 3° to assist take-off. Trials with this undercarriage arrangement were successful and {{paved the way for}} its use in other Soviet aircraft, including Dr. Brunolf Baade's Aircraft 150, then under development.|$|E

50|$|Carried an {{increased}} payload comparing {{to the earlier}} G.Va, and operated at a maximum takeoff weight of 4,550 kg (10,030 lb). To reduce the danger of flipping over during landing, Gothaer introduced the Stossfahrgestell ("shock <b>landing</b> gear"), a <b>tandem</b> two-bogie main <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> The Stossfahrgestell proved so good that it was fitted to all G.V's in Bogohl 3. Some G.Vb aircraft also had Flettner servo tabs on the ailerons to reduce control forces.|$|R
50|$|The Aeronca 7 Champion line—developed in the mid-1940s as a post-World War II {{response}} to the popular Piper J-3 Cub—uses similar design features (already featured in Aeronca's wartime designs, the Aeronca Model T, Aeronca Defender, and Aeronca L-3), but also incorporates aspects of traditional Aeronca designs, including the internal main trusswork of the fuselage frame. Like its predecessors and initial rivals, the high-wing, two-seat plane has <b>tandem</b> seating, conventional <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> (tailwheel-equipped), and a small piston engine.|$|R
50|$|The XB-48 was {{the first}} {{aircraft}} designed with bicycle-type <b>tandem</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear,</b> which had previously been tested on a modified B-26. The wing airfoil was too thin to house conventional landing gear mechanisms. The main landing gear was in the fuselage and small outriggers located on each wing were used to balance the aircraft.|$|E

25|$|The S-12 Airaile was {{designed}} by Randy Schlitter and introduced in March 1990 as a two-seat side-by-side, tricycle gear ultralight aircraft for recreational and flight training use. The single-seat version of the S-12, the S-14 Airaile, {{was designed}} one year later and entered production in 1991. The S-17 Stinger retains the wings, tail, boom tube of the S-14, mated to new forward 4130 steel tube cockpit and equipped with conventional <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> to create an open-cockpit ultralight that complies with the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles regulations. The S-18 Stinger II uses the S-12's wings, tail and boom tube, again with a new forward steel tube fuselage to create a <b>tandem</b> seat, conventional <b>landing</b> <b>gear,</b> open cockpit ultralight trainer.|$|R
500|$|Although {{no major}} {{problems}} were encountered {{during the initial}} testing phase, some minor issues with the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> and flight control system had to be rectified. The former problem was {{partly due to the}} <b>tandem</b> main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> being very narrow, in order to fit into the wings; the leg shortened in length and rotated as it was stowed. During one landing incident, the chain mechanism (used to shorten the gear) in the Mark 1 gear jammed, resulting in incomplete rotation. [...] In a second incident with Arrow 202 on 11 November 1958, the flight control system commanded elevons full down at landing; the resulting reduction in weight on the gears reduced the effective tire friction, ultimately resulting in brake lockup and subsequent gear collapse. A photograph taken of the incident proved that inadvertent flight control activation had caused the accident. The only occasion when a test flight was diverted occurred on 2 February 1959, when a TCA Viscount crash-landed in Toronto, necessitating a landing at CFB Trenton.|$|R
5000|$|The Super Cub {{retained}} the basic [...] "rag and tube" [...] (fabric stretched over a steel tube frame) {{structure of the}} earlier J-3 Cub.The first true [...] "Super" [...] Cubs had flaps, dual fuel tanks, and an O-235 Lycoming engine producing about 108 hp (115 hp for takeoff only). However, a 90 hp Continental variant without flaps and an optional second wing tank was available. Their empty weight was, on the average, 800-1000 pounds with a gross weight of 1,500 lb. These Cubs would take off in about 400 feet (at gross weight) and land in about 300 feet (thanks to the flaps). The Super Cub is renowned {{for its ability to}} take off and land in very short distances. The first Super Cubs were going to be offered with a unique four-wheel <b>tandem</b> main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> designed for <b>landing</b> and takeoff from rough terrain, but this was replaced with conventional <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> The O-290 Lycoming powered Cubs (135 hp) followed and would take off in about 200 ft. The landing distance remained the same at about 400 ft, or 300 ft using flaps. With the use of the Lycoming O-320 at 150-160 hp, the Cub's allowable gross weight increased to 1,750 lb while retaining the capability of a mere 200 ft required for takeoff.|$|R

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was named after}} the designer of the plane, Brunolf Baade. Only three airworthy prototypes were built; {{two of them were}} flown on three flights. The first prototype V1/I (DM-ZYA) was derived from the Samoljot 150 or Alekseyev 150 jet bomber designed by former Junkers engineers in the Soviet Union. It included a <b>tandem</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> and glazed nose for the navigator, which was a common feature in many Eastern Bloc aircraft. The 152's landing gear was unusual for a passenger plane in that the main gear was housed along the centerline of the fuselage with outrigger wheels in the wing-tips (similar to the more well-known Boeing B-47). The tail of the airplane was tested on a propeller driven aircraft, the Soviet Il-14, which was built under license in East Germany.|$|E

40|$|The {{reduction}} of <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> noise of aircraft on {{approach has been}} a focus of the aerospace community for many years. The present paper describes a method that predicts the noise from the <b>landing</b> <b>gear,</b> accounting for local flow variations due to the wing ge-ometry, {{the interaction of the}} <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> wake with high-lift devices, and a method for approximating the shielding of noise caused by the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> geometry. The prediction of the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> noise is performed using the <b>Landing</b> <b>Gear</b> Model and Acoustic Pre-diction code (LGMAP) developed at The Pennsylvania State University. A line of sight algorithm based on scattering by a two-dimensional cylinder approximates the effect of acoustic shielding caused by the <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> Two-dimensional FLUENT calculations of approximate wing cross-sections are used by LGMAP to compute the noise change due to the change in local flow velocity {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> A three-dimensional immersed boundary CFD calculation of isolated LGMAP representations of <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> geometries provides relatively quick estimates of the mean flow features caused by the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> for the prediction of trailing edge noise associated with the interaction of the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> wake with the high lift devices.
