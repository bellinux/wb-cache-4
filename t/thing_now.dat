5|$|In 2010, the Las Vegas Sun critic John Katsilometes, {{after being}} unimpressed by the initial show, said Believe had {{improved}} {{by reducing the}} narrative elements and focusing on the magic. In 2011, the Toronto Star wrote: “The show is easily the most exciting <b>thing</b> <b>now</b> on stage in Vegas!” That year the show attracted an estimated $150 million in ticket sales. The show currently has a ten-year performance contract that runs through 2019, and was the best selling magic show in Las Vegas as of 2013.|$|E

They realize that Blair is assimilated and has been scavenging equipment to build a small escape craft. Discovering that Childs is missing and the station's power generator is destroyed, MacReady speculates that the <b>Thing</b> <b>now</b> intends to hibernate until a rescue team arrives.

Blair transforms into a much larger monster and attacks, destroying the detonator, but MacReady still triggers the blast with a stick of dynamite, destroying the base.|$|E

Metal Maniacs asked Slayer in a 2006 interview whether they would consider playing South of Heaven in the footsteps of the Still Reigning tour, to which Araya replied, [...] "It's becoming a trendy <b>thing</b> <b>now.</b> I don't know. We have some really cool albums, but I don't think we'll ever do that again." [...] King was equally unsure, commenting, [...] "Probably not.

The team won the first two Tests, but lost {{the next three to}} lose the series 3–2, and Wisden blamed a weakness in batting for the defeat. Leyland {{was one of the few}} batsmen excused: [...] "Leyland, though very restrained, was one of the mainstays of the batting". Before the series, England were expected to struggle severely against the bowling of O'Reilly. According to Cardus, Leyland told O'Reilly before the first Test: [...] "Ah can tell thi one <b>thing</b> <b>now</b> for certain...

500|$|In March 2014, {{executive}} producer Jeffrey Bell stated at the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. PaleyFest panel that the producers and the writers {{are able to}} read the screenplays for upcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe films to know where the universe is heading, which allowed them to form a general plan for the show through the end of a third season. The series was renewed for that third season on May 7, 2015. By April 2015, Marvel had been developing a spinoff series to accompany the season, starring Adrianne Palicki and Nick Blood, but ABC opted not to go ahead with it, with entertainment president Paul Lee saying, [...] "We thought the right <b>thing</b> <b>now</b> is to leave [...] on S.H.I.E.L.D., because S.H.I.E.L.D. is so strong [...] the moment".|$|E

In August 2014, Adrianne Palicki was cast as Morse in a guest role, and later promoted to series regular with the season two episode [...] "Aftershocks". By April 2015, Marvel was developing a spin-off series focused on those characters with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. showrunner Jeffrey Bell and writer Paul Zbyszewski. The spin-off would be based on storylines occurring {{at the end of the}} second season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and would receive its own pilot rather than a backdoor pilot. Palicki and Blood were in final discussions to headline the potential new series, but ABC passed on the project by May 7, 2015, when they announced their series renewals, cancellations, and pickups. ABC entertainment president Paul Lee explained, [...] "We thought the right <b>thing</b> <b>now</b> is to leave [...] on S.H.I.E.L.D., because S.H.I.E.L.D. is so strong [...] the moment," [...] though he did not rule out returning to the spin-off in the future.|$|E

"Bach no Senritsu o Yoru ni Kiita Sei Desu" [...] and [...] "Years" [...] {{were written}} {{together}} directly after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, as therapy for {{him after the}} earthquake. He wrote the songs as having a common theme spread across two works, hence featuring them on Documentaly {{in the same order}} as they had appeared on the [...] "Bach no Senritsu o Yoru ni Kiita Sei Desu" [...] single. [...] "Bach no Senritsu o Yoru ni Kiita Sei Desu" [...] is a song written focusing on everyday occurrences, while [...] "Years" [...] was focused on messages reacting to the [...] "great anxiety" [...] in society during the post-earthquake time in Japan. The final track on the album, [...] "Document", was a song created to document the band's song creation process. The entire song was written and arranged in a single day, and fully recorded the following day. The lyrics were ad-libbed, a technique which Yamaguchi felt expressed a very personal side to himself, however made the lyrics more sarcastic and cynical than Sakanction's other songs. The song features the first ever instance in a Sakanaction song where Yamaguchi used the word [...] in his lyrics, something he sees as a natural response to seeing love as an everyday <b>thing</b> <b>now.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Giants {{were founded}} in 1925 by Tim Mara, a {{bookmaker}} (legal in 1925), businessman, and promoter, with {{an investment of}} US$500 after a meeting with league president Joseph Carr, and Harry March. Carr {{was sent to the}} east coast to find someone to put a team in a major city there to help the struggling league. Carr contacted Billy Gibson who was the manager of heavyweight boxer Gene Tunney and knew of Mara from Mara's interest in investing in Tunney. Mara decided to spend the $500 on the Giants as opposed to Tunney in a spur of the moment decision, and started the team with the statement, [...] "an exclusive franchise for anything in New York is worth $500." [...] His son Wellington later said that his father felt that even an empty store in the city was worth that price. Mara purchased the team, despite never having watched a single pro game, saying to the sellers at the time, [...] "Just tell me one <b>thing.</b> <b>Now</b> that I have a franchise, what do I do with it." [...] To differentiate themselves from the baseball team of the same name, they took the name [...] "New York Football Giants", which they still use as their legal corporate name.|$|E

But the whole point of evolution (the only point there is in it) is that no State will ever be rounded and polished, because it will always contain some organs that outlived their use, and some that have not yet fully found theirs.

2500|$|Two earlier {{versions}} of the poem can be found, the original typescript of the poem {{as well as that}} version with comments by Ezra Pound. In the typescript, the name of the poem is [...] "Gerousia", referring to the name of the Council of the Elders at Sparta. Pound, who was living in London in 1919, acted as Eliot's editor and influenced many of his works. When Eliot considered publishing the poem as the opening part of The Waste Land, Pound discouraged him from doing so saying, [...] "I do not advise printing Gerontion as preface. One don't miss it at all as the <b>thing</b> <b>now</b> stands. To be more lucid still, let me say that I advise you NOT to print Gerontion as prelude." [...] The lines were never added to the text and remained an individual poem.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{negative}} contemporary reviews, {{the film}} has been reappraised substantially {{in the years following}} its release.

The <b>Thing</b> <b>now</b> maintains an 81% [...] "Certified Fresh" [...] rating on Rotten Tomatoes; the site's consensus states: [...] "Grimmer and more terrifying than the 1950s take, John Carpenter's The Thing is a tense sci-fi thriller rife with compelling tension and some remarkable make-up effects." [...] It has been listed {{as one of the best}} of 1982 by Filmsite.org and Film.com. The film ranked #97 on Rotten Tomatoes' Journey Through Sci-Fi (100 Best-Reviewed Sci-Fi Movies), and a scene from The Thing was listed as #48 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments. Similarly, the Chicago Film Critics Association named it the 17th scariest film ever made. The Thing was named [...] "the scariest movie [...] [...] [...] ever!" [...] by the staff of the Boston Globe. In 2008, the film was selected by Empire magazine as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time. John Kenneth Muir, writing in Horror Movies of the 1980s, called it [...] "Carpenter's most accomplished and underrated directorial effort". [...] Muir goes on to say that it is [...] "the best science fiction-horror film of 1982, an incredibly competitive year, and perhaps even the best genre motion picture of the decade".|$|E
