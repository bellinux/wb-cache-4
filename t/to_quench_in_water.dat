50|$|The two {{important}} aspects of quenching are the cooling rate and the holding time. The most common practice is to quench into a bath of liquid nitrite-nitrate salt and hold in the bath. Because of the restricted temperature range for processing it is not usually possible <b>to</b> <b>quench</b> <b>in</b> <b>water</b> or brine, but high temperature oils are used for a narrow temperature range. Some processes feature quenching and then removal from the quench media, then holding in a furnace.

40|$|The present {{work was}} carried out on Al- 7 %Si- 0. 4 %Mg-X alloy (where X = Mg, Fe, Sr or Be), where the effect of {{solidification}} rate on the eutectic silicon characteristics was investigated. Two solidification rates corresponding to dendrite arm spacings (DAS) of 24 and 65 μm were employed. Samples with 24 μm DAS were solution heat-treated at 540 °C for 5 and 12 h prior <b>to</b> <b>quenching</b> <b>in</b> warm <b>water</b> at 65 °C. Eutectic Si particle charateristics were measured using an image analyzer. The {{results show that the}} addition of 0. 05 % Be leads to partial modification of the Si particles. Full modification was only obtained when Sr was added in an amount of 150 – 200 ppm, depending on the applied solidification rate. Increasing the amount of Mg to 0. 8 % in Sr-modified alloys leads to a reduction in the effectiveness of Sr as the main modifier. Similar observations were made when the Fe content was increased in Be-treated alloys due to the Be-Fe interaction. Over-modification results in the precipitation of hard Sr-rich particles, mainly Al 4 SrSi 2, whereas overheating causes incipient melting of the Al-Cu eutectic and hence the surrounding matrix. Both factors lead to a deterioration in the alloy mechanical properties. Furthermore, the presence of long, acicular Si particles accelerates the occurrence of fracture and, as a result, yields poor ductility. In low iron (less than 0. 1 wt%) Al-Si-Mg alloys, the mechanical properties in the as cast, as well as heat treated conditions, are mainly controlled by the eutectic Si charatersitics. Increasing the iron content and, hence, the volume fraction of Fe-based intermetallics leads to a complex fracture mode...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} study was to use a thermal shock test to evaluate the crazing resistance of six all-ceramic crown systems. The systems tested were: Vita In-Ceream®, Vita Hi-Ceram®, Dicor™ veneered with Vitadur® N, magnesia core veneered with Ceramco® II, magnesia core veneered with Silhouette™, and magnesia core veneered with Vita VMK® 68. A maxillary central incisor was prepared with 1. 0 mm axial and 1. 5 mm incisal reduction. Refractory dies were prepared and crowns were fabricated using the manufactures recommendations. Six specimens of each system were placed inside a beaker in a furnace at 90 °C. After 15 min heat soak, ice water was poured into the beaker through a funnel. The samples were dried in air, reheated, and inspected for crazing using light microscopy. If crazing was observed, this would constitute a failure at a temperature difference (ΔT) of 90 °C. If no failure occurred, the test was repeated at increasing temperature increments of 10 °C until failure. The crazing resistance of each system, expressed as the mean ΔT, was: > 200 (Hi-Ceram®), 152 ± 19 (Dicor™ / Vitadur® N), 143 ± 5 (magnesia core/Vita VMK® 68), 122 ± 21 (magnesia core/Silhouette™), and 118 ± 10 (magnesia core/Ceramco® II) °C.

This process is called tsuchioki. The edge of the blade is coated with a thinner layer than the sides and spine of the sword, heated, and then <b>quenched</b> <b>in</b> <b>water</b> (few sword makers use oil <b>to</b> <b>quench</b> the blade).
