In the course of looking for grazing areas, they had come in contact in southern Philistia with {{the inhabitants of the}} settled countryside. The biblical historian A.

5|$|Another {{way of life}} of chemotrophs in {{the absence}} of {{possible}} electron acceptors is fermentation, wherein the electrons taken from the reduced substrates are transferred to oxidised intermediates to generate reduced fermentation products (e.g., lactate, ethanol, hydrogen, butyric acid). Fermentation is possible, because the energy content of the substrates is higher <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> products, which allows the organisms to synthesise ATP and drive their metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from its}} larger size and more {{primitive}} molars, the Columbian mammoth also {{differed from the}} woolly mammoth by its more downturned mandibular symphysis; the dental alveoli (tooth sockets) of the tusks were directed more laterally away from the midline. Its tail was intermediate in length between that of modern elephants and the woolly mammoth. Since no Columbian mammoth soft tissue has been found, much less is known about its appearance <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woolly mammoth. It lived in warmer habitats than the woolly mammoth, and probably lacked many of the adaptations seen in that species. Hair thought {{to be that of}} the Columbian mammoth has been discovered in Bechan Cave in Utah, where mammoth dung has also been found. Some of this hair is coarse, and identical to that known to belong to woolly mammoths; however, since this location is so far south it is unlikely to be woolly mammoth hair. The distribution and density of fur on the living animal is unknown, but it was probably less dense <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woolly mammoth due to the warmer habitat.|$|E

5|$|As an A-type main {{sequence}} star, Beta Pictoris is more luminous than the Sun: combining the apparent magnitude of 3.861 with {{the distance of}} 19.44 parsecs gives an absolute magnitude of 2.42, {{as compared to the}} Sun, which has an absolute magnitude of 4.83. This corresponds to a visual luminosity 9.2 times greater <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun.

5|$|As intended, {{it would}} have functioned as a stealth helicopter, {{incorporating}} {{a number of different}} techniques and technologies in order to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS) along with other areas of visibility and detectability. The exterior surfaces of the RAH-66 were faceted and covered with both radar-absorbent material (RAM) coatings and infrared-suppressant paint; {{as a result of these}} combined measures, the Comanche's RCS was claimed to have been 360 times smaller <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. The acoustic signature of the rotorcraft was also reported to be noticeably lower than comparative helicopters; this reduction had been partially achieved through the adoption of an all-composite five-blade main rotor and pioneering canted tail rotor assembly.|$|E
