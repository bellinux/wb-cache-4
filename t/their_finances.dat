5|$|After Hogg's father died, {{he had to}} {{opportunity}} to move into his family home north of London. Although he initially considered doing so, he chose to stay in London due to the expense that maintaining a large home would involve. Jane also enjoyed living in London, she visited with friends and often gardened {{with her husband in}} his later years. The family led a quiet and stable life together, though at times <b>their</b> <b>finances</b> were strained.|$|E
5|$|After a brief tour of Sweden, they {{returned}} to London where they set new attendance records during their residency at the Marquee. However, their appearance at the 1976 Reading Festival failed to get a response from the crowd.

5|$|As {{the senator}} {{discussed}} <b>their</b> <b>finances,</b> the telecast again showed Pat Nixon, fixedly watching her husband. Pat Nixon later stated that her rapt gaze {{was because she}} did not know exactly what he would say, and wanted to hear. Nixon detailed their assets and liabilities: the mortgaged home in Washington; the similarly mortgaged home in California, then occupied by his parents. The loans from his parents and from Riggs Bank. The borrowed-against life insurance policy on the senator; no insurance on his wife or children. The two-year-old Oldsmobile and the family furniture, and {{that he and his wife}} owned no stocks or bonds.|$|E
5|$|In 1776, the Sejm {{commissioned}} former chancellor Andrzej Zamoyski {{to draft}} a new legal code. By 1780, he and his collaborators had produced the Zamoyski Code (Zbiór praw sądowych). It would have strengthened royal power, made all officials answerable to the Sejm, placed the clergy and <b>their</b> <b>finances</b> under state supervision, and deprived landless szlachta of many of their legal immunities. The Code would also have improved the situation of non-noblestownspeople and peasants. Zamoyski's progressive legal code, containing elements of constitutional reform, met with opposition from native conservative szlachta and foreign powers; the 1780 Sejm did not adopt it.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later, United Diamond Fields of British Guiana was {{incorporated}} as a limited company. The company used Oppenheimer {{as a technical}} adviser, and immediately arranged to have its diamonds sold to the syndicate. The price was to be fixed for six months, with an auditor's certificate {{at the end of}} that time used to negotiate a new price. Oppenheimer was the only one with access to the accounting information, and the rest of the company had no way of checking that his figures were correct. In the same time frame, a new deposit of diamonds was discovered in South Africa, forcing the syndicate to acquire several million pounds worth of these new diamonds to prevent their control over the market being destroyed. This strained <b>their</b> <b>finances</b> and the new diamonds forced the price down.|$|E

5|$|Complicating {{matters for}} the studios, {{the advent of}} sound film in 1927 {{required}} an immense expenditure in sound stages, recording booths, cameras, and movie-theater sound systems, {{not to mention the}} new-found artistic complications of producing in a radically altered medium. The studios were in a difficult financial position even before the market crash as the sound conversion process and some risky purchases of theater chains had pushed <b>their</b> <b>finances</b> near the breaking point. These economic circumstances led to a loss of nearly half of the weekly attendance numbers and closure of almost a third of the country's theaters in {{the first few years of}} the depression. Even so, 60 million Americans went to the cinema weekly.* McElvaine (Vol 1), pg. 448.|$|E
5|$|Hogg and {{his family}} {{subsequently}} lived a mostly quiet and stable life together. At times <b>their</b> <b>finances</b> were strained, although {{they were able to}} afford a cook and a maid. Hogg enjoyed spending time with his children and paid particular attention to their education. He taught his daughter Prudentia Greek and Latin, but discouraged her from becoming a Bluestocking. Hogg also tried to convince Jane to study Greek, but was unsuccessful. Henry Cleveland, Jane's nephew, moved into their household after leaving the military. Hogg then accepted Henry {{as a member of the}} family. Gardening had always been a hobby of Hogg's, and in his later years he often spent time maintaining his gardens with Jane.|$|E
5|$|In April 1979, McCain met Cindy Lou Hensley, {{a teacher}} from Phoenix, Arizona, whose father had founded a large beer distributorship. They began dating, and he urged his wife Carol to grant him a divorce, {{which she did}} in February 1980; the uncontested divorce took effect in April 1980. The {{settlement}} included two houses, and financial support for her ongoing medical treatments due to her 1969 car accident; they would remain on good terms. McCain and Hensley were married on May 17, 1980, with Senators William Cohen and Gary Hart attending as groomsmen. McCain's children did not attend, and several years would pass before they reconciled. John and Cindy McCain entered into a prenuptial agreement that kept most of her family's assets under her name; they would always keep <b>their</b> <b>finances</b> apart and file separate income tax returns.|$|E
40|$|There {{are some}} issues about how {{companies}} consider <b>their</b> <b>financing.</b> These issues {{are related to}} the amount, source, type, and the structure of such financing. So far, there is no uniform model that is able to explain how companies deal with these issues. There are three competing, dominant theories of financing decision making, i. e. the Pecking Order Theory, the Static Trade-off Theory, and the Agency Model Theory. This study attempts to explore which theory explains the best way for companies in the consumer industry to decide <b>their</b> <b>financing</b> method. There are five hypotheses to be tested in this study. Using data from public listed companies on the Indonesian Stock Exchange from 2008 to 2011, it seems that the Agency Model Theory is more dominant than the other two theories in explaining the way companies fulfill <b>their</b> <b>financing</b> needs...|$|R

5|$|The third spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, shows Scrooge a Christmas Day in the future. The ghost {{shows him}} scenes {{involving}} {{the death of}} a disliked man. The man's funeral will only be attended by local businessmen if lunch is provided. His charwoman, his laundress, and the local undertaker steal some of his possessions and sell them to a fence. When Scrooge asks the ghost to show anyone who feels any emotion over the man's death, the ghost can only show him the pleasure of a poor couple in debt to the man, rejoicing that his death gives them more time to put <b>their</b> <b>finances</b> in order. After Scrooge asks to see some tenderness connected with any death, the ghost shows him Bob Cratchit and his family mourning the passing of Tiny Tim. The ghost then shows Scrooge the man's neglected grave, whose tombstone bears Scrooge's name. Sobbing, Scrooge pledges to the ghost that he will change his ways to avoid this outcome.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{attempts}} {{to examine whether}} subsidiaries from different countries-of-origin differ {{with respect to their}} financial structures and performance in the same host country and whether greater foreign control affects <b>their</b> <b>financing</b> patterns and financial performance.

S. firms have adapted themselves to the Indian financial environment. <b>Their</b> <b>financing</b> patterns as well as the financial performance do not differ much from the Indian firms. Higher foreign control in the subsidiaries affects their financial structures but not their financial performance. 1...|$|R

25|$|Only five {{banks were}} opened during this time, while seeing many black-owned banks closed, leaving these banks with an {{expected}} nine-year life span for their operations. With African-Americans continuing to migrate towards Northern urban areas, they {{were faced with}} the challenge of suffering from high unemployment rates, due to non-minorities willing to do work that African Americans would previously take part in. At this time the entire banking industry, in the U.S., was suffering however, these banks suffered even more due to being smaller, having higher closure rates, as well as lower rates of loan repayment. The first groups of banks invested <b>their</b> <b>finances</b> back into the Black community, where as banks established during this period invested <b>their</b> <b>finances</b> mainly in mortgage loans, fraternal societies, and U.S. government bonds.|$|E
