5000|$|From 1946 to 1951 the 7JP4 was {{a common}} CRT (Picture Tube or Kinescope) used in lower priced {{televisions}} sold in the United States. These television were popular for portable carry around and small table top sets. These smaller sets were direct view electrostatic deflection designs. This required an extremely large amount of voltage to produce an image across the full display screen. In 1946, RCA influenced manufacturers (with royalty free circuit designs) to move toward electromagnetic deflection type televisions. Electromagnetic deflection uses varying magnetic fields to produce a full screen image. Horizontal and vertical electromagnets are placed at the picture <b>tube</b> <b>neck,</b> called the [...] "yoke". This method allowed the image to be viewed on larger screens. The first heavily mass-produced large picture tube to use this newer method of deflection was RCA's 10BP4, introduced in 1946. Soon after electrostatic picture tubes and the television electronic design would be completely replaced.|$|E
40|$|The {{flow field}} within a {{self-excited}} flexible tube was studied by employing flow visualization, velocity and pressure measurements. Under low positive tansmural pressures at the tube inlet (of {{the order of}} 50 mm H 2 O) the tube was set to an oscillatory motion, the initiation of which was due to a flow asymmetry. Namely, although initially the flow was separated {{from both sides of}} the formed divergent nozzle close to the tube outlet, at an arbitrary instant this became attached to one side, but stayed separated in the remaining part of the nozzle. When this flow asymmetry occurred, the walls approached each other and the <b>tube</b> <b>neck</b> formed there by started oscillating streamwise, setting the tube to an oscillatory motion. During the downstream motion of the <b>tube</b> <b>neck,</b> it was shrunk, causing a twofold increase of the local velocities compared to the inlet ones, which remained almost constant. On the contrary, when moving upstream, the <b>tube</b> <b>neck</b> expanded, causing a flow reversal in this area and a flow deceleration in the remaining part of the tube. The pressure signals upstream and downstream of the tube exhibited a phase difference, the latter leading, taking an order of magnitude higher values than the first one. © 1999 Academic Press...|$|E

As a tool, we used a hydrodynamic membrane tube extrusion technique to characterize the mechanical interaction between the plasma membrane and the underlying cortical cytoskeleton. Cells were anchored on 4. 5 μm beads coated with polylysine (PL) to obtain nonspecific cell adhesion or with an antibody against Ecad to mimic specific Ecad-mediated cell adhesion. We investigated tube length dynamics L(t) over time and through successive extrusions applied to the cell at regular time intervals. A constant slow velocity was observed for the first extrusion, for PL-attached cells. Subsequent extrusions had two phases: an initial high-velocity regime followed by a low-velocity regime. Successive extrusions gradually weakened the binding of the membrane around the <b>tube</b> <b>neck</b> to the underlying cortical cytoskeleton. Cells specifically attached via Ecad first exhibited a very low extrusion velocity regime followed by a faster extrusion regime similar to nonspecific extrusion. This indicates that Ecad strengthens the membrane-cortical cytoskeleton interaction, but only in a restricted area corresponding {{to the site of}} contact between the cell and the bead. Occasional giant “cortex” tubes were extruded with specifically anchored cells, demonstrating that the cortex remained tightly bound to the membrane through Ecad-mediated adhesion at the contact site...|$|E

This study was carried out to evaluate and compare the efficacy of Airtraq (AL) and Macintosh Laryngoscopes (ML) in intubating patients with cervical spine immobilization using manual inline axial stabilization technique (MIAS). MethodsThis randomized controlled study {{was carried out in}} Alexandria Main University Hospital on 40 adult ASA I and II patients after written informed consent and approval of the ethical committee, randomly categorized into two equal groups. All patients were subjected to same anesthetic protocol. Group I patients were intubated using AL and group II patients were intubated using ML. Hemodynamic measurements and oxygen saturation were recorded. Intubation criteria for both groups including (duration of intubation procedure, number of attempts, number of optimization maneuvers, Cormack and Lehane grade at laryngoscopy, Intubation Difficulty Scale score (IDS), rate of successful placement of endotracheal <b>tube,</b> <b>neck</b> mobility during laryngoscopy and intubation complications were recorded. Data statistically analyzed using SPSSR software using (t and χ 2 tests) and P< 0. 05 considered significant. ResultsThere was statistically significant increase in both heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure values following intubation in ML group than AL, oxygen saturation showed {{no significant difference between the}} two groups. Duration of intubation was statistically significant longer in ML group and needed more optimization maneuvers than the AL group, while for the number of intubation attempts; there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Both the Cormack and Lehane grading and IDS score values have shown statistically significant higher values in ML group. ConclusionThe Airtraq Laryngoscope offers a new approach for the management of difficult airway like patients with potential cervical spine injury, it is fast, easy to use, gets an easy view of the larynx without moving the cervical spines or causing hemodynamic stimulation...|$|E
40|$|Summary. This {{carried out}} work is aimed {{enhancing}} {{the efficiency of}} the spray scrubber by combining processes and improving hydraulic conditions in the device. The problem of treating waste gases is often characterized by unique features and the significant factor that makes it difficult to find {{a solution to the problem}} of treatment is the low and/or variable concentration of the pollutant. With a removal efficiency of up to 98 %, wet treatment technology in scrubber type devices is the only practical method advantageous to the treatment of waste gases. The set objective is solved by developing a two-stage treatment system for pyrolysis gas based on ejector scrubbers. Their advantage - a central nozzle supply that allows the scrubber to operate on the principle of an ejector pump. A drift eliminator of the developed device is located on the case unit and a chain is suspended from a clamp mounted on the lower part of the <b>tube</b> <b>neck</b> by pins and two detachable joints. The operation of the scrubber was checked in compliance with the absorption gas treatment of sulfur dioxide. A chemical sorbent, calcium carbonate which is produced as a by-product in the manufacture of nitroammophos at JSC “Minudobrenia” factory is used. Preliminary results indicate that the stiochiometric inlet ratio of Ca/S equals about 2. 0 and SO 2 emissions reduce by 80 - 90 %, significantly larger than the planned 70 % and subsequently corresponds to the residue concentration of less than 30 mg/m 3. This is explained by the greater degree of capture and deposition of the sorbent on the chain curtain (not more than 20 mg/m 3). The proposed device for treating gases enables: improvement in the efficiency of gas treatment; increased reliability; increase in the degree of treatment of the gas flow without the use of additional equipment; reduction in metal and design complexity; reduction on the cost of the treatment process and simplification in the device design...|$|E

In {{the case of the}} dumbbell-shaped tube, two modes of oscillations exist, one being an antisymmetric mode and the other a symmetric one for pressure variations in the neck, while {{in the case of the}} Sondhauss tube, only a mode corresponding to the antisymmetric one exists due to the boundary condition at the open end. Marginal conditions are sought numerically, not only for the lowest branches of both modes, but also for second higher branches, but they are available only for the lowest branch of the antisymmetric mode. For the Sondhauss tube, marginal conditions are obtained by taking account of radiation into free space. Some discussions are provided in comparison with experiments...|$|R

Based on theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, the forming process of rare axle with integrated structure were studied, experiment were done and the sample of rear axle were obtained. The experiment results were coincident with the simulation. The deformation and wall thickness increase law of necking process was obtained. The new forming process by end heating with temperature gradient was presented. It could be used to produce rear axle rapidly and less energy consumption...|$|R
40|$|Cellular {{organelle}} membranes {{maintain their}} integrity, global shape, and composition despite vigorous exchange among compartments of lipids and proteins during trafficking and signaling. Organelle homeostasis involves dynamic molecular sorting mechanisms {{that are far}} from being understood. In contrast, equilibrium thermodynamics of membrane mixing and sorting, particularly the phase behavior of binary and ternary model membrane mixtures and its coupling to membrane mechanics, is relatively well characterized. Elucidating the continuous turnover of live cell membranes, however, calls for experimental and theoretical membrane models enabling manipulation and investigation of directional mass transport. Here we introduce the phenomenon of curvature-induced domain nucleation and growth in membrane mixtures with fluid phase coexistence. Membrane domains were consistently observed to nucleate precisely at the junction between a strongly curved cylindrical (tube) membrane and a pipette-aspirated giant unilamellar vesicle. This experimental geometry mimics intracellular sorting compartments, because they often show tubular-vesicular membrane regions. Nucleated domains at <b>tube</b> <b>necks</b> were observed to present diffusion barriers to the transport of lipids and proteins. We find that curvature-nucleated domains grow with characteristic parabolic time dependence that is strongly curvature-dependent. We derive an analytical model that reflects the observed growth dynamics. Numerically calculated membrane shapes furthermore allow us to elucidate mechanical details underlying curvature-dependent directed lipid transport. Our observations suggest a novel dynamic membrane sorting principle that may contribute to intracellular protein and lipid sorting and trafficking...|$|R

40|$|The {{electromagnetic}}-thermal-mechanical {{process of}} electromagnetic forming (EMF) {{is a high}} velocity manufacturing technique that uses electromagnetic (Lorentz) body forces to shape sheet metal parts. One of the several advantages of this technique is the considerable ductility increase observed in several metals, particularly aluminum. In this research two important aspects of this process are addressed: {{the influence of the}} sheet metal’s constitutive response on ductility and the consistent formulation of the fully coupled electromagnetic-mechanical problem. The first part of the work addresses the necking localization of a metal sheet during an electromagnetic process. A “weak band” model is used to predict the onset of necking of a thin sheet under plane stress and in-plane electric currents, an idealization of the local conditions in unconstrained electromagnetic loading. This work finds that EMF increases ductility over quasistatic techniques, due to the material’s strain-rate sensitivity, and details how the material constitutive response and process characteristics affect ductility. The general theory is subsequently applied to freely expanding electromagnetically loaded aluminum <b>tubes.</b> <b>Necking</b> strains are measured in tubes of various geometries that are loaded by different forming coils and electric currents. The experimental results show reasonable agreement with the corresponding theoretical forming limit predictions, which indicate a two to three fold increase in the forming limits with respect to the quasistatic case. The second part of the work pertains to predictive modeling of EMF processes. Recent works do not consistently account for the coupling between electromagnetic fields and finite deformations. Typically, separate solutions to the electromagnetic and finite strain mechanical problems are combined in lock-step. The present work employs a fully coupled Lagrangian (reference configuration) least-action variational principle. This principle forms the basis of the proposed variational integration numerical scheme that provides a consistent staggered solution algorithm. Application of the general theory is considered for axisymmetric problems. Results from this simulation compare well with known analytical ring expansion solutions. Finally, this work simulates a range of realistic tube expansion processes, including the novel problem of electromagnetic expansion of tubes with non-conducting outer coatings...|$|R

60|$|From this {{description}} it is sufficiently obvious how Genlisea secures its prey. Small animals entering the narrow orifice--but what induces them to enter {{is not known}} any {{more than in the}} case of Utricularia--would find their egress rendered difficult by the sharp incurved hairs on the lips, and as soon as they passed some way down the neck, it would be scarcely possible for them to return, owing to the many transverse rows of long, straight, downward pointing hairs, together with the ridges from which these project. Such creatures would, therefore, perish either within the neck or utricle; and the quadrifid and bifid papillae would absorb matter from their decayed remains. The transverse rows of hairs are so numerous that they seem superfluous merely for the sake of preventing the escape of prey, and as they are thin and delicate, they probably serve as additional absorbents, {{in the same manner as}} the flexible bristles on the infolded margins of the leaves of Aldrovanda. The spiral arms no doubt act as accessory traps. Until fresh leaves are examined, it cannot be told whether the line of junction of the spirally wound lamina is a little open along its whole course, or only in parts, but a small creature which forced its way into the tube at any point, would be prevented from escaping by the incurved hairs, and would find an open path down [page 451] the <b>tube</b> into the <b>neck,</b> and so into the utricle. If the creature perished within the spiral arms, its decaying remains would be absorbed and utilised by the bifid papillae.
