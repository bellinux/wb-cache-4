5|$|The {{founder of}} khất sĩ {{had been a}} {{supporter}} of freeing birds {{as an act of}} compassion, and this has been continued by some monks and lay people as it is believed to be meritorious, but others have spoken out against {{on the grounds that the}} demand for birds used for such ceremonies merely prompt more people to capture <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> place.|$|E

5|$|Frank Richards succeeded Watson as club {{secretary}} in 1911, {{and when the}} First World War broke out {{he took over the}} managerial reins as well. Under Richards Birmingham won the Second Division title in 1921 and signed players such as Joe Bradford, Johnny Crosbie and Dan Tremelling who did much to keep the club in the top flight through the 1920s. He also forgot to enter them in the 1922 FA Cup. Billy Beer and Bill Harvey kept <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> Division, albeit in {{the lower half of the}} table, before former Arsenal manager Leslie Knighton took charge in 1928. He led them to their first FA Cup final in 1931 and a top-half league finish the following year, but left when Chelsea made him an offer Birmingham were unable to match. Former Birmingham defender George Liddell kept them in the top tier until they were relegated in the last season completed before the Second World War, resigning in September 1939 when league football was suspended. His tenure of just over six years made him the club's longest-serving team manager.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in Greece {{the only}} {{disturbance}} to Macedonian rule was the {{attempt by the}} Spartan king Agis III to lead a rebellion of the Greeks against the Macedonians. However, he was defeated in 331 BC at the Battle of Megalopolis by Antipater, who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth in Alexander's stead. Although the governor of Thrace, Memnon, had threatened to rebel, it appears that Antipater dissuaded him with diplomacy before campaigning against Agis III in the Peloponnese. Antipater deferred the punishment of Sparta to the League of Corinth headed by Alexander, who ultimately pardoned the Spartans {{on the condition that}} they submit fifty nobles as hostages. Antipater's hegemony was somewhat unpopular in Greece due to his practice of exiling malcontents and garrisoning cities with Macedonian troops, yet in 330 BC, Alexander declared that the tyrannies installed in Greece were to be abolished and Greek freedom restored (despite the possibility that the Macedonian king most likely had Antipater install <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> place).|$|E
5|$|The law courts' {{jurisdiction}} over the guardianship of children {{is said to have}} come from the King's prerogative of parens patriae. The Chancery had administered this area of law from an early period, since it primarily concerned the holding of land– a form of trust. Since these were mainly dealt with orally there are few early records; the first reference comes from 1582, when a curator was appointed to deal with the property of an infant. While the common law courts regularly appointed guardians, the Chancery had the right to remove them, replace them or create <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> place. Similarly, while there were actions against guardians which the child could undertake in the common law courts, these were regularly undertaken in the Court of Chancery. This jurisdiction was first regularly recognised from 1696 onwards, and its main focus was the welfare of the child. As such, wards of the court had certain principles: their estates had to be administered {{under the supervision of the}} Court, they had to be educated under the same supervision, and any marriage had to be sanctioned by the Court.|$|E

50|$|Ducking and shaving was the {{practice}} of shaving new seamen and ducking <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sea <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time they cross the Tropic of Cancer. The custom, common on 18th-century British sailing vessels, involved tying a rope around the man and dunking him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sea three times from the main yard. Sailors could pay a fine to escape the rite of passage, but most accepted it, many enthusiastically.|$|R
