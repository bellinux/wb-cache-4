The cows may be permanently {{housed in a}} barn, and {{spend most of their}} time resting or feeding in the free-stall area. If cows are to be grazed as well, using a selection gate to allow only those cows that have been milked to the outside pastures has been advised by some AMS manufacturers.|$|E
40|$|A {{questionnaire}} {{was conducted to}} study the farmers’ behaviour concerning the replacement of <b>teat-cup</b> liners. Most of the questioned farmers replaced the <b>teat-cup</b> liners well past the recommended 2, 500 milkings. Two in vitro experiments were used to investigate the role of <b>teat-cup</b> liner age in the possible transmission of Staphylococcus aureus. <b>Teat-cup</b> liners were contaminated with milk, from a cow {{known to be a}} Staph. aureus carrier. A <b>teat-cup</b> liner juice method was used to sample the <b>teat-cup</b> liners after contamination, the number of colony forming units (CFU) Staph. aureus / ml was defined. Three sets <b>teat-cup</b> liners of different ages were used in the experiments. No significant association was found between <b>teat-cup</b> liner age and Staph. aureus concentration in the samples...|$|E
40|$|Friesian-type {{dairy cows}} were milked with {{different}} machine settings {{to determine the}} effect of these settings on teat tissue reaction and on milking characteristics. Three <b>teat-cup</b> liner designs were used with varying upper barrel dimensions (wide-bore WB = 31. 6 mm; narrow-bore NB = 21. 0 mm; narrow-bore NB 1 = 25. 0 mm). These liners were tested with alternate and simultaneous pulsation patterns, pulsator ratios (60 : 40 and 67 : 33) and three system vacuum levels (40, 44 and 50 kPa). Teat tissue was measured using ultrasonography, before milking and directly after milking. The measurements recorded were teat canal length (TCL), teat diameter (TD), cistern diameter (CD) and teat wall thickness (TWT). Teat tissue changes were similar with a system vacuum level of either 50 kPa (mid-level) or 40 kPa (low-level). Widening the liner upper barrel bore dimension from 21. 0 mm (P < 0. 01) or 25. 0 mm (P < 0. 001) to 31. 6 mm increased the magnitude of changes in TD and TWT after machine milking. Milk yield per cow was significantly (P < 0. 05) higher and cluster-on time was reduced (P < 0. 01) with the WB cluster as compared to the NB 1 cluster. Minimum changes in teat tissue parameters were achieved with system vacuum level of 40 kPa and 50 kPa using NB and WB clusters, respectively. Similar changes in teat tissue and milk yield per cow were observed with alternate and simultaneous pulsation patterns. Widening pulsator ratio from 60 : 40 to 67 : 33 did not have negative effects on changes in teat tissue and had a positive effect on milk yield and milking time. Milk liner design had a bigger effect on teat tissue changes and milking characteristics than pulsation settings. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{theme of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis is focused on evaluation of influence of milking technology by milk machine on welfare milk cow. Ethologic displays of milk cows after milking and various parameters related to milking were found out. The main parameters were the amount of attempts to place <b>teat-cups,</b> the time from milk cow?s entering into the robot to successful placing all four <b>teat-cups,</b> the whole time of milking and the time between every single milking. Further, the need of fluid and food intake and lying down in the 30 minutes after milking were observed during the ethologic observation. At {{the end of the}} observation the state of health of milk cows with focus on mammary gland illnesses was assessed. Ethologic observations took place twice, always last 24 hours and the results were compared with the order of milk cow?s lactation and with every single observation. Part of the data were gain during the observation itself and part from the milk machine?s database. During both observations the average amount of attempts to place <b>teat-cups</b> was detected as about 1. 6 per one milking. The average time from milk cow?s entering into the box to placing <b>teat-cups</b> was 2 minutes and 18 seconds. The whole time of milking per 24 hours was 12 hours and 37 minutes during the first observation and 11 hours and 48 minutes during the second observation. The time between milking was on average 11. 5 hours when milking twice a day and about three hours when milking three times a day. As far as the activity in the 30 minutes after the milking is concerned, milk cows had similar habits, bigger difference was in fluid intake both from the viewpoint of every single observation and from the viewpoint of the order of milk cow?s lactation as well. The need of food intake was on average at 84 % of observed milk cows, the need of fluid intake was on average at 37 % of observed milk cows and the need of lying down was at 7 % of observed milk cows. The amount of mammary gland illnesses was at a low level. During the observations was found out that the using of milking machines has positive influence on welfare milk cows. Milk cows had permanent access to water and food, in the stable was quality climate, the amount of mammary gland illnesses was negligible. Milk cows had enough of space and were calm because they did all activities during the day wholly voluntarily...|$|R
40|$|The {{dairy sector}} is {{important}} to Argentina because it creates genuine wealth and employment. The competitiveness of Argentine dairy farms {{is crucial to the}} endurance of the dairy sector. One way to increase the competitiveness of dairy farm systems is to incorporate beneficial innovations. New Zealand (hereafter NZ) dairy systems are internationally known for their competitiveness without the presence of subsidies. Argentine dairy farmers have been attracted to NZ systems for more than 40 years. Simultaneously. NZ researchers and extension agents have been interested in extending NZ knowledge to Argentina. Despite the fact that the NZ knowledge appears to be beneficial to Argentine farms, and after so many resources spent. NZ practices have been rarely adopted. This seemingly fruitless effort in extending this technology shapes the research question of the present study: Can Argentine dairy farmers benefit from adopting New Zealand dairy farm principles and practices? The main objectives of the research are the following: 1) Define a group of New Zealand ideas. practices and technologies that could be considered potentially useful innovations for Argentine dairy farmers. 2) Assess the adoption and rejection of the NZ innovations by a group of Argentine farmers. 3) Identify the reasons of adoption and rejection for each innovation. 4) Describe the impact of the adoption in the physical and financial performance of the farms. 5) Assess which have been the main causes of the non-spread of NZ innovations in Argentine dairy farms. Seven Argentine dairy farmers, who were aware of NZ dairy systems, were selected as case studies. The data was collected through interviews, farm physical and economic records, and a field visit to the farm. In order to investigate the Argentine socio-economic environment and the Argentine dairy sector, relevant literature was reviewed and two key industry informants were interviewed. Two frameworks were utilized to analyse the qualitative and quantitative data: the Diffusion Theory (Rogers. 2003) and the IFCN network (International Farm Comparison Network www. ifennctwork. oru), respectively. Ten NZ innovations were defined; they were principles and practices considered typical in NZ dairy farms and not common in Argentine dairy farms. The innovations were related to four areas of the dairy system: pasture management, herd management & genetics, farm structure & organization, and human resources. The seven farmers dillercd in the level of adoption or rejection of the innovations. The two innovations most adopted were: Focus on Production per Hectare and NZ Style of Milking Shed and Milking System; and the two least adopted were: Less than 15 cows per Set of <b>Teat-cups</b> and other innovations related to labour productivity and Utilization of Formal Pasture Budgets. Some associations were found between the level of adoption of NZ innovations by the case study farms, the most relevant follows: increments in Return on Investment (ROI); reduction of land costs per kg of milk produced and increments in labour productivity. The NZ principle Less than 15 cows per Set of <b>Teat-cups</b> was found to be the innovation most closely associated with increase in labour productivity. NZ Genetics cows were found to be necessary for the adoption of seasonal calving. An association was found between the adoption of NZ Genetics and higher milk yield per kilogram of live weight, and lower mortality and replacement rates, than those that had not adopted...|$|R
40|$|Swedish {{agriculture}} is currently undergoing radical changes {{with respect to}} the working environment. New production milking systems may alter the physical workload and thus {{have an effect on the}} development of musculoskeletal disorders. Earlier studies have shown that there is a manifest risk of suffering injury to the forearm, wrist and hand during machine milking especially during the attaching task (when holding the milking cluster in one hand while attaching the four <b>teat-cups</b> to the udder). High degrees of dorsiflexion and deviation of the wrist in combination with peak values of muscle activity in the forearm during milking might contribute injuries to the wrist and hand. Large-scale milk production increases the time spent performing the tasks involved. As a consequence, the cumulative engagement in extreme positions and rapid movements, and high level of muscular load on the upper extremities will also increase. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the workload on the milker's forearm, wrist and hands resulting from using the prototype of a device designed to facilitate the attaching task. The device is constructed as a support arm where the milking cluster is suspended in order to reduce the workload. The study was carried out in a loose-housing system where the cows come to be milked in a parlour. Eleven milkers participated in the study. The muscle activity in the biceps and the forearm flexors, as well as positions and movements of the wrists were measured by electromyography and electrogoniometry. The attaching task was measured both with and without the device. When the prototype was used only a minor decrease in the muscular load on the holding side was recorded. Surprisingly, the effect on the wrist positions and movements was small. This marginal effect could be due to the fact that all the milkers were used to milking without the support arm and despite the training period, they were unable to make full use of the device...|$|R
40|$|In a {{cross-sectional}} study, {{we investigated}} {{the effects of}} human-animal interactions and management factors on udder health in 46 Swiss dairy herds living in loose-housing systems on farms that participated in the Swiss dairy farm network “pro-Q. ” The human-animal relationship was measured by observing milkers´ behavior, cows’ behavior during milking, and cows’ avoidance distance in the barn. Management factors were assessed by questionnaire-guided interviews and observations. Udder health was evaluated using indicators that were calculated from milk recording data {{over a period of}} 1 yr before assessment: (1) average somatic cell scores (SCS) per herd and (2) incidence of new infections per herd (NEWINF); and indicators that were calculated from quarter milk samples of all lactating cows at the time of assessment: (3) prevalence of quarters with elevated somatic cell counts (> 100, 000 cells/ mL; %Q> 100) and (4) prevalence of mastitis quarters (> 100, 000 cells/mL and culturally positive; %Qmast). After univariate preselection of associated factors, multivariable linear regression models were calculated at the herd level and a multilevel regression model was calculated at the herd and cow levels for SCS. Among all of the human-animal relationship factors, the most dominant predictor for SCS, %Q> 100, and %Qmast was the percentage of positive interactions of milkers with the cows in relation to all of their interactions during milking. Furthermore, a higher prevalence of fearful cows in the herd (with an avoidance distance > 1 m) was associated with a higher %Q> 100. In herds with a higher NEWINF, incidents of cows kicking during milking occurred more frequently. Concerning management as well as farm and herd characteristics, the following mastitis risk factors were found: (1) breed, especially Holstein with regard to SCS, NEWINF, and %Qmast; (2) high age in terms of lactation number with regard to SCS and %Qmast; (3) high amount of new infections of a cow over 1 yr with regard to SCS; (4) air-adsorption during application of <b>teat-cups</b> with regard to NEWINF; (5) lack of separation of diseased cows with regard to NEWINF; and (6) ample dimensions of lying places with regard to %Qmast. The results suggest that the human-animal relationship is relevant for udder health, especially for cows’ reactions to infections expressed as somatic cell count levels. Risk of infection itself appears to be mainly influenced by management factors. Hence, the human-animal relationship may be considered in extension concerning preventive mastitis control...|$|R
