The grand jury's prosecuting attorney, Hamilton Caldwell, was not {{confident}} {{that he could get}} a conviction in a case of white violence against a black male accused of insulting a white woman. A local black paper was surprised at the indictment and praised the decision, as did the New York Times. The high-profile comments published in Northern newspapers and by the NAACP were of concern to the prosecuting attorney, Gerald Chatham; he worried that his office {{would not be able to}} secure a guilty verdict, despite <b>the</b> <b>compelling</b> evidence. Having limited funds, Bryant and Milam initially had difficulty finding attorneys to represent them, but five attorneys at a Sumner law firm offered their services pro bono. Their supporters placed collection jars in stores and other public places in the Delta, eventually gathering $10,000 for the defense.|$|E
5|$|The family sought {{compensation}} {{from the}} National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP), {{but in order}} to qualify they were required to prove that it was more likely than not that their children's autism was caused by their vaccines. The scientific community had concluded that vaccines did not cause autism years before the first cases were heard, and concern was therefore expressed that the relatively lax evidentiary standards of the NVICP could lead to compensation being awarded in spite of <b>the</b> <b>compelling</b> scientific evidence to the contrary. This, some vaccine supporters argued, might have serious adverse public health effects by discouraging vaccine manufacturers from producing more childhood vaccines. Though the NVICP had existed since 1988, it was not designed to handle the thousands of cases it received from 1999 to 2007, which led to the establishment of the Omnibus Autism Proceeding in 2002.|$|E

5|$|In the {{following}} years, companies applied {{the principles of}} corporate identity and corporate design to increase awareness and recognition by consumers and differentiation from competitors. Olivetti became famous for its attention to design through their corporate design activities. In 1936 Olivetti hired Giovanni Pintori in their publicity department and promoted Marcello Nizzoli from the product design department to develop design in a comprehensive corporate philosophy. In 1956, inspired by <b>the</b> <b>compelling</b> brand character of Olivetti, Thomas Watson, Jr., CEO of IBM, retained American architect and industrial designer Eliot Noyes to develop a corporate-wide IBM Design Program consisting of coherent brand-design strategy together with a design management system to guide and oversee the comprehensive brand identity elements of: products, graphics, exhibits, architecture, interiors and fine art. This seminal effort by Noyes, with his inclusion of Paul Rand and Charles Eames as consultants, {{is considered to be}} the first comprehensive corporate design program in America. Up to and during the 1960s, debates in the design community were focused on ergonomics, functionalism, and corporate design, while debates in management addressed Just in time, Total quality management, and product specification. The main proponents of design management at that time were AEG, Bauhaus, HfG Ulm, the British Design Council, Deutscher Werkbund, Olivetti, IBM, Peter Behrens, and Walter Paepcke.|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, the European {{cultural}} elite were discovering African, Oceanic and Native American art. Artists such as Paul Gauguin, Henri Matisse and Picasso were intrigued and {{inspired by the}} stark power and simplicity of styles of those cultures. Around 1906, Picasso, Matisse, Derain and other artists in Paris had acquired an interest in primitivism, Iberian sculpture, African art and tribal masks, {{in part because of}} <b>the</b> <b>compelling</b> works of Paul Gauguin that had suddenly achieved center stage in the avant-garde circles of Paris. Gauguin's powerful posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the Salon d'Automne in Paris in 1903 and an even larger one in 1906 had a stunning and powerful influence on Picasso's paintings.|$|E

She does not know if she will try to escape or not, and when she realizes she has feelings for her captor, she prefers not {{to be given a}} chance. In spite of some dark elements, Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! can be described as a romantic comedy, and the director's most clear love story, with a plot similar to William Wyler's thriller The Collector.|$|E

25|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>compelling</b> {{seismogram}} {{from the}} 1940 event in El Centro, strong-motion seismology was not explicitly sought until later events occurred—the San Fernando earthquake made evident {{the need for}} more data for earthquake engineering applications. The California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program was initiated in 1971 with the goal of maximizing the volume of data by furnishing and maintaining instruments at selected lifeline structures, buildings, and ground response stations. By the late 1980s, the program had instrumented more than 450 structures, bridges, dams, and power plants. The 1979 Imperial Valley and 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquakes were presented as gainful events that were recorded during that period, because both produced valuable data that increased knowledge of how moderate events affect buildings. The success of the Imperial Valley event was especially pronounced because of a recently constructed and fully instrumented government building that was shaken to the point of failure.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce {{that even though}} the First Amendment did protect {{corporate}} expression, restrictions on independent expenditure were justified due to <b>the</b> <b>compelling</b> interest to prevent corruption or the appearance of corruption in campaigns. The Austin majority quoted Bellotti in agreeing that political speech did not lose First Amendment protection “merely because the speaker is a corporation.” However, the Austin majority held that the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, a non-profit corporation that wanted to publish a newspaper advertisement supporting a candidate, did not qualify for the non-profit exemption established in Federal Election Commission v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc (1986). The dissent in the Austin case cited the statement in Bellotti that “the legislature is constitutionally disqualified from dictating the subjects about which persons may speak and the speakers who may address a public issue.” The dissent found that Massachusetts’s law discriminated {{on the basis of the}} speaker’s identity, and argued that the precedents of the Supreme Court, such as Bellotti, condemn this type of censorship. Scholars agree that the Austin decision was inconsistent with precedent in that the Court had previously never upheld a statue that regulated corporate independent expenditure because of a state interest in preventing corruption.|$|E
