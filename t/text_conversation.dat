25|$|The player character, {{an unnamed}} android, is awoken in a serene environment. A disembodied entity named Elohim instructs the android {{to explore the}} worlds he has created for it, and to solve the various puzzles to collect sigils, but warns it not to climb a tower at the centre of these worlds. As the android progresses, it becomes evident that these worlds exist only in virtual reality, and that it, like other androids it encounters, are {{separate}} artificial intelligence (AI) entities within a computer program. Some AIs it encounters act as Messengers, unquestioningly serving Elohim and guiding the android through the puzzles. Messages left by other AIs present varying views of the artificial worlds and of Elohim, with some stating that Elohim's words should be doubted, while the Milton Library Interface, a <b>text</b> <b>conversation</b> program found on various computer terminals, encourages the android to defy Elohim's commands.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{contribute}} with increased understanding and knowledge about <b>text</b> <b>conversations</b> concerning fiction. The aim of this study is partly to increase knowledge about which skills pupils can develop through <b>text</b> <b>conversations</b> about fiction, partly to give insight about teachers’ knowledge about the configuration form <b>text</b> <b>conversations</b> about fiction, and pupils’ experiences about implementing in <b>text</b> <b>conversations.</b> To answer the {{purpose of this}} study empirical material was gathered through qualitative interviews with eight teachers and eleven pupils in a municipality in northern Sweden. The result shows that teachers perceive their form of <b>text</b> <b>conversations</b> as a <b>conversation</b> about a <b>text,</b> which they have read together, were different models are applied and open questions are asked. The pupils have some partial statement about the implementation of <b>text</b> <b>conversations</b> where some has the same idea about <b>text</b> <b>conversations</b> as the teachers. Other pupils say that the implementation of the <b>text</b> <b>conversations</b> are conversations about individually read <b>texts,</b> or <b>conversations</b> about how fictions should be written. The results also show pupils’ and teachers’ experiences about how <b>text</b> <b>conversations</b> can help to increase reading comprehension. The pupils believe that the <b>text</b> <b>conversations</b> can increase the understanding about a text by listen to other classmates’ thoughts about the text. The teachers mention several benefits with <b>text</b> <b>conversations</b> during the interviews. Some benefits they mention is that the vocabulary can be improved, the interest in reading grows and they develop a critical thinking and starts to use each other as resources for increased learning. Conclusions that can be made from this study is that <b>text</b> <b>conversations</b> about fiction can be perceived different in differently ways, and that <b>text</b> <b>conversations</b> are important to increases the reading comprehension.

50|$|The {{messaging}} app {{works in}} a similar way to any conventional messaging app. Users invite people to join and can use the system as a standard messaging app. Messages remain private, until the user decides to publish parts or entire conversations, at which point they become public. People can follow users who regularly have interesting <b>text</b> <b>conversations</b> or share interesting content. In 2014, Ian commented on the desire for people to share their own <b>text</b> <b>conversations</b> and read conversations by others, particularly celebrities. The example he gave was when Macklemore texted Kendrick Lamar, after Macklemore's Grammy success and then tweeted an image of the conversation which went viral.|$|R

50|$|Intertitles {{almost always}} served {{the purpose of}} {{introducing}} characters and setting. Intertitles also often conveyed dialogue. Occasionally these intertitles included illustrations, but most often they were black with white <b>text.</b> <b>Conversation</b> could also be shown using body language and mouthing. Color silent films are quite rare, as inexpensive color film was not invented until the late 1930s; {{the vast majority of}} silent comedies are in black and white. Seven Chances is an exception, with opening scenes filmed in early Technicolor.|$|E
50|$|Unlike most chat/instant {{messaging}} applications, which {{follow a}} vertical scrolling paradigm, The TalkShoe Live! Pro client text chat scrolls horizontally, placing chat bubbles {{in a row}} next to the screen {{name of the person}} who typed them. It also uses threading in which responses to a given chat message take on the same color as that chat message. This is intended to allow easy tracking of conversations by users who are not able to give the <b>text</b> <b>conversation</b> their full attention. The Web-based TalkShoe Live! client uses a more traditional vertical scrolling paradigm.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} the <b>text</b> and <b>conversation</b> {{exchange}} is reciprocal: <b>text</b> needs <b>conversation</b> and vice versa for the process of communication to occur. Text, or content, must have context to be effective and a conversation, or discourse, {{needs to have a}} beginning, middle and end. Individuals create the beginning, middle and end by using punctuation, bracketing or framing. When conversation is coupled with text, or meaning, communication occurs. Taylor submits this process is a translation process of: translation of <b>text</b> to <b>conversation</b> and the translation of <b>conversation</b> into <b>text.</b>|$|R

50|$|Deaf {{and hearing}} {{impaired}} {{persons in the}} U.S. today sometimes use telecommunications devices for the deaf (TTYs or TDDs) or interpreting services to contact 9-1-1. Many deaf people use text messaging and instant messages to communicate with others, but unfortunately, today's 9-1-1 is not equipped to accept these media. This under-serviced demographic accounts for approximately 10% {{of the general population}} in Canada and the US (20% of those over 65 and 40% of those over 75). In the NG9-1-1 environment, hearing and speech impaired individuals will be able to place such a call by sending a text message from their cell phone. They will be able to carry on a <b>text</b> <b>conversation</b> with 9-1-1 center personnel, and even send pictures or video when necessary. In 2013, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) in Canada, announced {{the first phase of the}} country's NG9-1-1 services, implementation of Text with 911 (T911) for the deaf, hard of hearing, and speech impaired community.|$|E

The children of Mitchell Brook Primary School acted out the launch of the Large Hadron Collider in 2008. Jon Snow gave his news report about [...] "Sex on Fire". The mystery guest was Jon Morter, who started the Facebook campaign to make Rage Against The Machine's [...] "Killing in the Name" [...] the Christmas number 1 in 2009. A Dalek also appeared in the studio to ask the final bonus question, and to [...] "exterminate" [...] Carr at the end of the quiz. Brand and Fielding referenced their past name as the [...] "Goth Detectives" [...] several times. They got many of their correct answers from an ongoing <b>text</b> <b>conversation</b> with members of the live studio audience. The ruse was discovered when Carr took Brand's phone, called one of the numbers, and an audience member answered. Chico also appeared via text, responding to Jack Whitehall.|$|E
5000|$|Kick It Out {{has come}} under {{criticism}} from ethnic minorities in the football industry for not having a big enough impact on the punishment of players and fans convicted of racist abuse. In the autumn of 2012, {{at the end of}} a footballing week marred by racial abuse and violence in an international under-21 fixture between England and Serbia, the campaign organised for Premier League players to wear shirts bearing the organisation's logo before their matches. However, the directive was boycotted by several black players, including Manchester United's Rio Ferdinand, Manchester City's Micah Richards and Reading's Jason Roberts, in protest against the lack of action by the organisation in the wake of high-profile cases of footballers racially abusing their opponents during matches. Following that incident, Manchester City player Joleon Lescott refused to wear the Kick It Out T-shirt before games. This follows his involvement with an FA inquiry into alleged racial abuse against Everton player Joseph Yobo by Newcastle United's Emre. Although Lescott had given written evidence, Emre escaped punishment. Former footballer Paul Elliott left his role at Kick It Out on 23 February 2013, following a reported <b>text</b> <b>conversation</b> in which [...] "discriminatory abusive comments" [...] were made to fellow former footballer Richard Rufus.|$|E

In this paper, we address one of its key sub-problems, referred to as short <b>text</b> <b>conversation,</b> in which given a message from human, the computer returns a reasonable response to the message. We leverage the vast amount of short conversation data available on social media to study the issue. We propose formalizing short <b>text</b> <b>conversation</b> as a search problem at the first step, and employing state-of-the-art information retrieval (IR) techniques to carry out the task. We investigate the significance as well as the limitation of the IR approach. Our experiments demonstrate that the retrieval-based model can make the system behave rather "intelligently", when combined with a huge repository of conversation data from social media.
