5|$|On 3 June, Spain was {{approached}} by the US ambassador with a request to use Spanish ports for evacuating the wounded, following landings in southern France. Originally the plan had been to request access {{for the purposes of}} staging the initial invasion. However, this was toned down in light of historical resistance to any foreign occupation of Spanish soil as well as the implausibility of invading France via the Pyrenees. On 5 June the British ambassador reinforced the request, and after some discussion the Spanish government agreed but only after an invasion had occurred, and under <b>the</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Red Cross. To emphasise the change in objective, the Allies followed this up with Operation Ferdinand which threatened an invasion in Italy.|$|E
