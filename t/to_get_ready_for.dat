5|$|The local {{population}} remained faithful to Skanderbeg {{and did not}} reveal his whereabouts. Isak bey and Hamza grew confident that Skanderbeg had been defeated and had thus began to withdraw. When he judged the time right, Skanderbeg gave the signal for the army, which had up until then been in separate groups, to assemble without being seen by the Ottomans. The army gathered by the hills at Tumenishta – as the weakest point in the Ottoman camp was in this direction – and on 2 September 1457, it was split again into three groups to assault the Ottoman camp. With {{some of his most}} trusted men, he climbed to a high peak to scout on the Ottoman camp and saw that the Ottomans were resting. He descended with his chosen band to eliminate any watching guards, but one saw Skanderbeg and fled into the camp yelling that Skanderbeg had arrived. In order to maintain the surprise, Skanderbeg ordered his men <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> battle.|$|E

25|$|In two-way trunks with E and M signaling, a {{handshake}} took place to prevent both switches from colliding by dialing {{calls on the}} same trunk at the same time. By changing the state of these leads from ground to -48 volts, the switches stepped through {{a handshake}} protocol. Using DC voltage changes, the local switch would send a signal <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> a call and the remote switch would reply with an acknowledgment {{to go ahead with}} dial pulsing.

But Green Bay's pass protection on the slick field had been seriously tested during the game; the Cowboys had sacked Starr eight times.|$|E

25|$|Part of {{the need}} for {{revisions}} of the play was clearly due to purely practical concerns of stagecraft, apart from the demands of political censorship. Much of the point of the revision was to streamline the play, to make it more actable; though even the revised version would have needed a minimum cast of 18—13 adults and five boys. Two of the Additions, III and VI, occur {{at the beginning and end}} of the middle third respectively, giving more time for costume changes. Addition III provides a soliloquy by More and a 45-line dialogue between two actors; Addition VI provides a similar breathing-space for the actors <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> the play's final phase.|$|E
25|$|Supply trains carried all the {{necessary}} material for the construction up to the railhead, with mule or horse-drawn wagons carrying it {{the rest of the}} ways if required. Ties were typically unloaded from horse-drawn or mule-drawn wagons and then placed on the track ballast and levelled <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> the rails. Rails, which weighed the most, were often kicked off the flatcars and carried by gangs of men {{on each side of the}} rail to where needed. The rails just in front of the rail car would be placed first, measured for the correct gauge with gauge sticks and then nailed down on the ties with spike mauls. The fishplates connecting the ends of the rails would be bolted on and then the car pushed by hand to the end of the rail and rail installation repeated.|$|E

25|$|On flight day 6, {{the members}} of Endeavours crew {{performed}} a focused inspection of an area of thermal protection tiles {{on the bottom of}} the orbiter. The tiles were damaged during launch, and detailed data provided by the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) was needed to make sure the orbiter could re-enter Earth's atmosphere safely. The focused inspection started with the Canadarm2 grappling the OBSS in the middle of the boom and handing it off to the shuttle's Canadarm, which was controlled by pilot Greg Johnson and mission specialists Mike Fincke and Roberto Vittori. The inspection process took approximately two hours to complete, and resulted in the Thermal Protection System (TPS) being cleared for entry. After the inspection was complete, Fincke joined Drew Feustel to get their spacesuits ready for the second spacewalk of the mission on flight day 7. The pair performed the standard overnight campout procedure <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> the EVA.
