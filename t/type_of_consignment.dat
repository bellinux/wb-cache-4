50|$|The Polish Post {{for years}} has been {{systematically}} losing the monopoly for various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>consignments.</b> Until the end of 2012 it availed from the legal benefit of having the reserved area, which gave it the exclusive rights to provide services, receive and deliver parcels weighing up to 50 g. At the same time, until the 24 September 2008 the owners and administrators of buildings had the responsibility to replace letter boxes, which are owned by the Polish Post, with European letter boxes available for all postal operators.In 2012 the works concerning the amendment of the Postal Law Act were completed and after the liquidation of the formal monopoly the actual monopoly, e.g. in case of official mail is declining in favor of competitors like InPost.|$|R
40|$|Bankruptcy {{law allows}} {{third-party}} creditors of a consignee to attach consigned {{property in the}} consignee 2 ̆ 7 s possession when the consignee declares bankruptcy unless a consignor has acted to perfect a security interest in the consigned goods by complying with commercial law requirements. The drafters of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provided for attachment {{because they wanted to}} protect third-party creditors from the unwelcome surprise of hidden liens dominating claims to a consignee 2 ̆ 7 s property in bankruptcy. Applying this attachment policy overly broadly in the art consignment context creates problems, though, because opportunistic creditors can use the attachment procedure despite having full knowledge of the widespread practice <b>of</b> <b>consignment</b> in the art industry. In 2001, the drafters revised the UCC with the desire to clarify consignment issues as part of the revision. Courts continue to struggle, however, with analyzing issues <b>of</b> <b>consignment</b> in bankruptcy. This Note argues that because art consignment stands apart from other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>consignment,</b> the law should not require art consignor-collectors to follow UCC filing requirements to protect their artwork from attachment by third-party creditors, who are acutely aware of the risk that a consignee art dealership is substantially dealing in consigned artwork. Further, it suggests that courts should presume that art dealerships are generally known to be substantially selling in consigned work. Once consignors show that an art dealership is generally known to be substantially selling in consigned work, courts should exempt consigned artwork from the bankruptcy estate. This Note also proposes extending the statutory protection afforded to consignor-artists to consignor-collectors...|$|R
40|$|Consignment {{contracts}} {{have been}} widely employed in many industries. Under such contracts, items are sold at a retailer's but the supplier retains the full ownership of the inventory until purchased by consumers; the supplier collects payment from the retailer based on actual units sold. We investigate how competition among retailers influences the supply chain decisions and profits under different consignment arrangements, namely a consignment price contract and a consignment contract with revenue share. First, we investigate how these two consignment contracts and a price only contract compare {{from the perspective of}} each supply chain partner. We find that the retailers benefit more from a consignment price contract than from a consignment contract with revenue share or a price only contract, regardless of the level of retailer differentiation. The supplier's most beneficial contact, however, critically depends upon the level of retailer differentiation: a consignment contract with revenue share is preferable for the supplier if retailer differentiation is strong; otherwise a consignment price contract is preferable. Second, we study how retailer differentiation affects the profits of all supply chain partners. We find that less retailer differentiation improves the supplier's profit for both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>consignment</b> contract. Moreover, less retailer differentiation improves profits of the retailers in a consignment price contract, but not necessarily in a consignment contract with revenue share.

40|$|AbstractTwo {{alternatives}} <b>of</b> <b>consignment</b> {{preparation in}} an urban distribution centre serving a network of hypermarkets are analysed.

After identification and pick-up from the storage areas simultaneously for all destinations, products are then sorted per destination. Quasi-simultaneously all the consignments are prepared for loading onto the delivery vehicles. The second alternative is looking at identification and pick-up from storage depending on the consignment destination. For each destination consignments are successively prepared. The comparison described in the paper between the two technologies (simultaneous and successive consignment preparation) highlights the advantages <b>of</b> the simultaneous <b>consignment</b> preparation.
