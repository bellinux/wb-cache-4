5|$|As {{you long}} ago wrote me, {{and told me}} personally, nay predicted, Jackson has thrown me overboard; he is not only unwilling <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has in every single instance refused office to my friends, and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others. Nor does he stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and my friends in Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, I have read those folks at Washington thoroughly... I am not of a temper to pocket insult, neglect, or injury. I have, my dear friend, determined on my course. I can be as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors, and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet, but when the day of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. You must know that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. Then I will begin to formulate a message in which, as you know, my own principles will be maintained.|$|E

5000|$|According to the 9/11 Commission Report, {{after the}} plane's voice data {{recorder}} was recovered, it revealed pounding and crashing sounds against the cockpit door and shouts and screams in English. [...] "Let's get them!" [...] a passenger cries. A hijacker shouts, [...] "Allahu akbar". Jarrah repeatedly pitched {{the plane to}} knock passengers off their feet, but the passengers continued their assault and at 10:02:17, a male passenger said, [...] "Turn it up!" [...] A second later, a hijacker said, [...] "Pull it down! Pull it down!" [...] At 10:02:33, Jarrah was heard to plead, [...] "Hey! Hey! <b>Give</b> it <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Give</b> it <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Give</b> it <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Give</b> it <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Give</b> it <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Give</b> it <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Give</b> it <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Give</b> it <b>to</b> me." [...] The plane crashed into an empty field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania at 580 miles an hour, killing everyone on board. The plane was twenty minutes of flying time away from its suspected target, the White House or the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. According to Vice President Dick Cheney, President George W. Bush had <b>given</b> the order <b>to</b> shoot the plane down had it continued its path to Washington.|$|R
25|$|Worried that {{officials}} might harass the families whose photos {{she had already}} taken, she flashed her press card and exposed the film to the light. The guard angrily yelled at her, ‘I didn't ask you to expose your film, I told you <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> your camera’ ‘You can have the camera’, she retorted, ‘but the film belongs to me.’ She was detained, and was interrogated {{over the next three}} days by police officers, prosecutors and intelligence officials.|$|E
25|$|If I say a {{whole system}} must be upset for me to win, I am saying that I cannot sit in the game, and that safer rules must be made <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> a chance. I {{repudiate}} that. If others are in there, deal me a hand and let me see what I can make of it, even though I know some in there are dealing from the bottom and cheating like hell in other ways.|$|E
25|$|He {{procured}} me a Chinese interpreter, Fong Shi, {{a pleasant}} and agreeable young Chinaman, who wrote his mother-tongue with ease and spoke Jagatai Turki fluently, and—did not smoke opium. He left {{his wife and}} child behind him in Khotan, Liu Darin making himself answerable for their maintenance. But I also paid Fong Shi three months' salary in advance, and that money he gave to his wife. Whenever I could find leisure he was <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> lessons in Chinese, and we began at once, even before we left Khotan...........|$|E

500|$|Bob Mackey of US Gamer {{was more}} {{critical}} of the game, giving it 2 of 5 stars. Though initially praising its visuals and setting, Mackey found the puzzles {{to be very difficult}} and [...] "there's simply too much going on <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> the proper feedback about what I'm getting wrong", suggesting that [...] "Blow was maybe a little too close to his work".|$|E

Thanks!' And you know I love and respect her to death so I wouldn't pass that chance up." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{finally got}} tired of making movies where all I did was walk across the screen and look pretty. I got a big chance to do some real acting in The Postman Always Rings Twice, and I'm not going to slip back if I can help it. I tried to persuade the studio <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> {{something}} different. But every time I went into my argument about how bad a picture was, they'd say, [...] "well, it's making a fortune". That licked me.|$|E
500|$|Despite Coveleski's {{success in}} Cleveland, {{he was not}} a fan of playing there; he stated that he [...] "didn't like the town. Now the people are all right, but I just didn't like the town." [...] He also stated that it began to affect his {{performance}} on the mound, and that he began to get [...] "lazy" [...] from being with the club so long. He did, however, have praise for his catcher: [...] "The best thing that happened to me there was pitching to Steve O'Neill. He caught me for nine years in Cleveland and knew me so well he didn't even need <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> a sign".|$|E

500|$|Part of the {{inspiration}} for the episode came from the Shakespeare play Richard III, most notably, the interaction between Richard and Lady Anne. The biggest inspiration for the episode, however, came from the fact that Davis wished to have an episode wherein he would interact solely with Gillian Anderson. He later noted, [...] "if they're not going <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> a scene with Gillian, I'll just have to write one myself." [...] The episode's title, [...] "En Ami," [...] translates from French into English as [...] "as a friend." [...] The title also functions as a pun, reading phonetically as [...] "enemy" [...] in English.|$|E
500|$|Victoria {{wrote to}} her uncle Leopold, whom Victoria {{considered}} her [...] "best and kindest adviser", to thank him [...] "for the prospect of great happiness you have contributed <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me,</b> {{in the person of}} dear Albert... He possesses every quality that could be desired to render me perfectly happy. He is so sensible, so kind, and so good, and so amiable too. He has besides the most pleasing and delightful exterior and appearance you can possibly see." [...] However at 17, Victoria, though interested in Albert, was not yet ready to marry. The parties did not undertake a formal engagement, but assumed that the match would take place in due time.|$|E
500|$|Wellman {{frequently}} {{conflicted with}} the military officers brought in to supervise the picture, especially the infantry commander whom he considered to have [...] "two monumental hatreds: fliers and movie people". After one argument Wellman retorted to the commander, [...] "You're just a goddamn fool because the government has told me you have <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> all your men and do just exactly what I want you to do." [...] Although Wellman {{paid much attention to}} technical details in shooting, he used cars and clothing of the year during the filming, forgetting to use those of World War I. He took six weeks to fully edit the film and prepare it for release.|$|E

500|$|Wilson was {{notable for}} making anagrams {{based on the}} names {{of his friends and}} acquaintances. [...] M'Clure {{described}} them as numerous and nimble, and if not exact, they were always instructive, and he would rather force a poor match than lose the moral. [...] An anecdote given by Wilson biographer M'Clure, whether true or not, points to the character of Wilson: [...] a person met Wilson returning from a journey and remarked, [...] "Sir, I have sad news for you: [...] while you have been abroad, your house is burnt." [...] To this Wilson is reputed to have replied, [...] "Blessed be God! [...] He has burnt this house, because he intends <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> a better." ...|$|E
500|$|Woon, a Peranakan, {{was born}} on 12 September 1956 in Singapore to schoolteachers. He was a head prefect at Pasir Panjang Primary School (which his father became {{principal}} of years later) and a prefect while at Raffles Institution. Following his A-levels he was considering business administration, but ended up accepting a scholarship from DBS Bank to study law instead. According to Woon in an April 2008 interview, [...] "When I went for the scholarship interview, the interviewer said, 'We looked at your results and {{you look like you}} might be a lawyer; {{would you like to do}} law?' I said, 'Fine, if you want <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> the scholarship to do law, I'll do law'. I didn't plan to do law." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's story {{received}} mixed reviews. Sliva {{said the}} narrative was [...] "drenched in uninteresting pathos that failed <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> {{a reason to}} care about these characters that I've spent well over 100 hours with." [...] Juba called the story [...] "a joke", saying {{that there was little}} development for Lightning as a character, and that the narrative [...] "killed whatever lingering investment [...] had in the universe." [...] VanOrd found the large amount of character dialogue a distracting and jarring feature, while Parkin said that the game's narrative could not fix the issues present in the previous two XIII games, although the side-quests and dialogue helped lighten Lightning's character. Elliot spoke of it as one of the reasons to play the game, terming it a [...] "typically bonkers narrative".|$|E
