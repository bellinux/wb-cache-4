They added that they also wanted to make an Advance Wars title that even veterans of the series would find fresh. The setting was also {{a reason for the}} design change, being a [...] "not-so-distant future science fiction" [...] setting, which the developers felt didn't fit well with the style of previous titles. When asked whether they feared that gamers would be turned off by the changes, the developers responded by saying that they have to [...] "fight against" [...] this fear. The developers felt that without innovation, the series would turn players off, so they introduced new gameplay mechanics as well as the new setting.|$|E
2500|$|MTV {{began its}} annual Spring Break {{coverage}} in 1986, setting up temporary operations in Daytona Beach, Florida, {{for a week}} in March, broadcasting live eight hours per day. [...] "Spring break is a youth culture event", MTV's vice president Doug Herzog said at the time. [...] "We {{wanted to be part}} of it for that reason. It makes good sense for us to come down and go live from the center of it, because obviously the people there are <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who watch MTV." [...] The channel's coverage featured numerous live performances from artists and bands on location. The annual tradition would continue into the 2000s, when it would become de-emphasized and handed off to mtvU, the spin-off channel of MTV targeted at college campuses.|$|E
2500|$|The {{story of}} Atlas Shrugged {{dramatically}} expresses Rand's ethical egoism, her advocacy of [...] "rational selfishness", whereby {{all of the}} principal virtues and vices are applications {{of the role of}} reason as man's basic tool of survival (or a failure to apply it): rationality, honesty, justice, independence, integrity, productiveness, and pride. Rand's characters often personify her view of the archetypes of various schools of philosophy for living and working in the world. Robert James Bidinotto wrote, [...] "Rand rejected the literary convention that depth and plausibility demand characters who are naturalistic replicas of <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> we meet in everyday life, uttering everyday dialogue and pursuing everyday values. But she also rejected the notion that characters should be symbolic rather than realistic." [...] and Rand herself stated, [...] "My characters are never symbols, they are merely men in sharper focus than the audience can see with unaided sight. ...My characters are persons in whom certain human attributes are focused more sharply and consistently than in average human beings".|$|E
