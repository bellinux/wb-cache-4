50|$|During {{the roll}} bending process the pipe, extrusion, or solid is {{passed through a}} series of rollers (typically 3) that apply {{pressure}} to the pipe gradually changing the bend radius in the pipe. The pyramid style roll benders have one moving roll, usually the <b>top</b> <b>roll.</b> Double pinch type roll benders have two adjustable rolls, usually the bottom rolls, and a fixed <b>top</b> <b>roll.</b> This method of bending causes very little deformation in the cross section of the pipe. This process is suited to producing coils of pipe as well as long gentle bends like those used in truss systems.|$|E
50|$|Extended Nip Presses (or ENP) are a {{relatively}} modern alternative to conventional roll presses. The <b>top</b> <b>roll</b> {{is usually a}} standard roll, while the bottom roll is actually a large CC roll with an extended shoe curved {{to the shape of}} the <b>top</b> <b>roll,</b> surrounded by a rotating rubber belt rather than a standard roll cover. The goal of the ENP is to extend the dwell time of the sheet between the two rolls thereby maximising the de-watering. Compared to a standard roll press that achieves up to 35% solids after pressing, an ENP brings this up to 45% and higher—delivering significant steam savings or speed increases. ENPs densify the sheet, thus increasing tensile strength and some other physical properties.|$|E

40|$|Operation {{of sugar}} mills with {{individual}} {{variable speed drives}} corresponds to propulsion of each roll of the sugar mill independently by electro-hydraulic variable speed or electromechanical variable frequency drives. This paper {{presents the results of}} the tests carried out in Santa Isabel sugar mill in Brazil, when each four roll mill of four mill tandems was driven by four hydraulic motors of the same size; two of them mounted on the both sides of the <b>top</b> <b>roll</b> and one of them on each inferior roll. It was found that the best way of operating the mill from a mechanical and operational point of view is to keep the torque distribution between the rolls (pressure in the hydraulic systems) at 50, 25, and 25 %. This arrangement has the advantage of using motors of the same size, providing the optimum application of the torque to the mill. Operation of the mill with higher cane roll speed in relation to the <b>top</b> <b>roll</b> speed and lower baggase roll speed, gives better feeding of the cane to the mill and lower reabsorbtion. Because of the variable speed of the drives and different speeds of the rolls, the mills could be operated with almost constant torques on each roll. The numerical operational results of the tandem as capacity, extraction and power consumption are very impressive...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} the hull panel roll bending processing time accurately, first, both the panel's elastic and plastic deformations in the hull panel roll bending processing were analyzed along with the final state after roll bending processing. Then, a model of hull panel processing time was developed. The model was further evaluated by comparing its estimated processing time for different hull panels with the practically measured data. The results show {{no significant difference between}} the <b>top</b> <b>roll</b> positions calculated based on elastic and plastic deformation theory and the actual positions. There was no significant difference in processing time between the estimation from the proposed model and the actual measured processing time; all estimated errors were within 10 % (the average error was 5 %). Therefore, the proposed estimation model of ship plate processing time based on elastic and plastic deformation theory is reasonable and feasible for real practice. open...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{cold rolling}} process, {{asymmetric}} shape defects {{are still a}} common problem to strip quality. For the mills with inverse symmetry roll shifting system, different roll wear and thermal contour of <b>top</b> <b>roll</b> system and bottom roll system could cause asymmetric shape defects during shifting operation. In this paper, three dimension finite element simulation models of inverse shifting roll system were established to calculate the parameters and to analyze the effects. Based on the idea in the mill engineering that mill style option depended on the product grade, shifting weakness was evaluated and the opinion of limit shifting was suggested. To improve control effect to asymmetric shape defects in cold rolling, shape control system with asymmetric shape control ability is developed, including asymmetric edge drop control at upstream stands and asymmetric flatness control at last stand. The further improvement of asymmetric shape control theory and practice is the key way to reach the higher precision of shape quality in cold strip mills...|$|E
40|$|A {{square steel}} pipe is {{reshaped}} from a welded round pipe by roll forming. The effect of ellipse preforming on the cross-sectional {{size of the}} square steel pipe was investigated by experiment and three-dimensional finite element simulation. When designing a roll-forming machine for a square steel pipe, {{the diameter of the}} paired top and bottom rolls is usually set larger than that of the side roll pair, thereby avoiding interference between the roll axes driven by electric motors. When the diameter of the <b>top</b> <b>roll</b> is larger than that of the side roll, the width of a corner part of the formed pipe is larger than the height. A square pipe was formed from a preformed elliptical pipe to make the width and height of the corner part equal. As a result of ellipse preforming, the peripheral length of a square product increases {{and the size of the}} corner part of that product decreases. Therefore, elliptical preforming is effective in forming square pipe with a sharp corner. However, excessive preforming causes a hollow at the flat surface of a square product.

40|$|The heat {{transfer}} characteristics of turbulent impinging jets, typical of {{those used in}} paper machine cross machine direction caliper profile control were measured. The effect of jet entrainement on the impingement {{heat transfer}} by unconfined jets was successfully scaled using a jet thermal entrainement factor. The addition of a confinement plate to an existing unconfined impinging jet control system was shown to improve the average heat transfer by 33 % and 80 % for a nozzle-to-impingement surface spacing of 2 and 1 respectively. The thermal deformation of calender roll under control actuators was predicted numerically using finite volume and finite element techniques. The most desirable steady state control characteristics, i. e. high peak deformation and small width of deformation, were obtained on unheated rolls of minimum practical thickness. The results indicate that control actuator spacings less than 0. 2 m provide negligible control advantage. Experiments were performed on a double calender stack of a production newsprint machine to determine the optimal position for cross-machine direction calender control actuators which would minimize the response time and maximize {{the magnitude of the}} response. Control on the queen roll and the two rolls immediately above it produces the strongest response. The king roll and the <b>top</b> <b>roll,</b> each of which affects only one nip, are shown to be poor choices for the placement of control actuators. When two calenders are used in succession, the actuators should be placed in the first stack. Calender roll design must be considered when choosing the location for control actuators...|$|E

40|$|With the {{steadily}} {{increase in}} demand for roll formed products due to their application for fields such as automotive, construction, architecture, etc., roll forming companies are challenge with rising customer demands. Companies are struggling to bring a product through from design to manufacture at improved rates, whilst achieving tighter tolerances. The roll forming process may also induce undesirable forming defects such as twist, distortion and straightness problems. Traditionally these issues would be resolved through an empirical approach which heavily relies on the designer's expertise and intuition. This approach can increase undesired development costs due to materials wasted and time delayed. Over the years, numerical simulations have been deployed to try and geometrically validate these defects and ultimately reduce the development phase of a product. The designer has the capability to virtually investigate changes in specific parameters without the risk of expensive tooling costs. The industry partner of this project, Hadley Group, Birmingham, implement Belleville washers into the roll tool configuration. The purpose of these washers is to apply pressure to the strip during roll forming in order to drive material through each forming station. They are also used to adjust {{the gap between the}} top and bottom forming rolls, since the incoming material gauge can vary by the nominal tolerance values from coil to coil. For the purpose of this paper, an investigation is carried out focusing on an individual parameter within the finite element analysis (FEA) of the cold roll forming process, i. e. the 'unknown' spring acting on the <b>top</b> <b>roll</b> during the forming process due to the implementation of Belleville washers in the pillar set up. The work explained in this paper shows the eects of the pressure applied to the forming process on the geometric attributes of the section being formed. The outcome will determine the viability of this parameter, which may ultimately require the numerical design methodology of roll formed products to be amended accordingly...|$|E
