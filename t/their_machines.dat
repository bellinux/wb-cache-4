Lawrence and his cyclotron pioneers, helping them understand the data <b>their</b> <b>machines</b> were producing at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. In 1936 Berkeley promoted him to full professor at a salary of $3300 per annum. In return {{he was asked to}} curtail his teaching at Caltech, so a compromise was reached whereby Berkeley released him for six weeks each year, enough to teach one term at Caltech.|$|E
5|$|In August 2010, Russian {{authorities}} arrested nine individuals {{connected to}} a ransomware Trojan known as WinLock. Unlike the previous Gpcode Trojan, WinLock did not use encryption. Instead, WinLock trivially restricted access to the system by displaying pornographic images, and asked users to send a premium-rate SMS (costing around US$10) to receive a code {{that could be used}} to unlock <b>their</b> <b>machines.</b> The scam hit numerous users across Russia and neighboring countries—reportedly earning the group over US$16 million.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, 15 April, he flew {{his final}} sortie with 65 Squadron flying support for 266 Squadron and 402 Squadron. On {{the way back}} in the afternoon he claimed one Bf 109 destroyed. This, his fifth victory, made him an official fighter ace. However, according to other accounts, only two Bf 109s were involved in the brief air battle. Finucane's and 65's likely opponents in the battle was Adolf Galland, Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) Jagdgeschwader 26 and future General der Jagdflieger (General of Fighter Forces). Galland had taken off with his wingman and a crate containing lobster loaded into the fuselage of his Bf 109 to deliver to Jagdfliegerführer 2 Theo Osterkamp for his birthday at Luftflotte 2 headquarters. En route, Galland took a detour over the English coast and attacked several flights of Spitfires, claiming two 266 squadrons shot down. Galland's landing-gear fell down during the battle, possibly leading Finucane to claim it as destroyed. Both German pilots returned to France, <b>their</b> <b>machines</b> undamaged. Finucane was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) on 25 April.|$|E

25|$|Most of the {{machines}} {{in the early days}} of MS-DOS had differing system architectures and there was a certain degree of incompatibility, and subsequently vendor lock-in.

25|$|In {{the decade}} {{preceding}} Unix, computers had grown enormously in {{power to the}} point where computer operators were looking for new ways to get people to use their spare time on <b>their</b> <b>machines.</b> One of the major developments during this era was time-sharing, whereby a number of users would get small slices of computer time, at a rate at which it appeared they were each connected to their own, slower, machine.|$|E
25|$|The {{competition}} was {{won by the}} SIPA S.90, but SALS nevertheless also ordered 100 examples of this, the runner-up design.

Only 27 of the order had been completed, however, when Aérocentre was liquidated and its assets bought by Nord.

25|$|Throughout its history, Gateway {{attempted}} {{to move the}} stodgy IBM PC model in more home-/consumer-friendly machines. Gateway {{was the first major}} manufacturer to offer a suite of family-friendly software as an alternative to Microsoft Office, the first to include optical drives as standard equipment on all of its machines, and the first to include high-end speakers with the purchase of a sound card (like the Boston Acoustics Digital BA735).

It provided a platform for users to access and download compressed digital music files, specifically MP3s, from other users' machines. Unlike many peer-to-peer services, however, Napster included a central server that indexed connected users and files available on <b>their</b> <b>machines,</b> creating a searchable list of music available across Napster's network. Napster's ease of use compared to other peer-to-peer services quickly made it a popular service for music enthusiasts to find and download digital song files for free.|$|E

25|$|Alpha and beta {{radiation}} have low penetrating power and {{are unlikely to}} affect vital internal organs from outside the body. Any type of ionizing radiation can cause burns, but alpha and {{beta radiation}} {{can only do so}} if radioactive contamination or nuclear fallout is deposited on the individual's skin or clothing. Gamma and neutron radiation can travel much further distances and penetrate the body easily, so whole-body irradiation generally causes ARS before skin effects are evident. Local gamma irradiation can cause skin effects without any sickness. In the early twentieth century, radiographers would commonly calibrate <b>their</b> <b>machines</b> by irradiating their own hand and measuring the time to onset of erythema.|$|E
25|$|Postage stamps {{issued in}} sheets with no {{perforations}} between the rows and columns of individual stamps {{are referred to}} as imperforate. The Washington-Franklin issue contains several series of imperforate stamps that occur on a small range of denominations from 1 through 5-cents. These stamps were issued in imperforate form to accommodate several major vending machine companies of that period who used this stock for coil stamps in <b>their</b> <b>machines</b> which were in wide use about the country. Many of these companies applied their own form of perforations, such as the , Mail-O-Meter, and Brinkerhoff vending machine companies. There were at least seven such firms, each having its own patented machines. Imperforate stamps were issued in full uncut sheets of 400 subjects or in coil rolls of 500 or 1000 stamps. The imperforate issues were printed from a flat plate with 400 subjects until 1918 when they were produced on the rotary press from continuous rolls of paper. Imperforate coils from this stock are much rarer than examples cut from full sheets.|$|E
25|$|Upon mankind's {{first attempt}} to repopulate and {{reconstruct}} after the Collapse, it is discovered that hostile alien races have occupied mankind's former colonies and civilizations, and are now encroaching upon the City. Throughout the game, players have to combat aggressive aliens who have occupied the Solar System. Just like the Light for the Guardians, the Darkness lends powers to these alien threats. There are five separate races in the game, each occupying different planets. The Fallen are an insectoid race of nomadic pirates who scavenge ruined settlements on Earth, the Moon, and Venus for resources. The Hive are a macabre race of ancient aliens who have created massive underground settlements beneath Earth and the Moon's surface. The Vex are semi-organic androids who are attempting to seize control of Venus and Mars by turning them into <b>their</b> <b>machines,</b> which they have already done to Mercury. The Cabal are a military-industrial empire of gigantic amphibians who have established massive fortifications on Mars. The Taken, a new race introduced in The Taken King, are corrupted versions of regular enemies, who infest areas on every planet. Rise of Iron added a new faction of Fallen called the Devil Splicers, which are Fallen who have been modified by a technological plague called SIVA. They are found on Earth in a zone outside of the Wall called the Plaguelands.|$|E
