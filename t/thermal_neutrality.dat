40|$|Carbon {{molecular}} sieves (CMS) and zeolites {{are widely used}} as microporous sieving solids for gas and liquid separations. However, due to hydrophobicity, better <b>thermal</b> stability, and <b>neutrality</b> in both acidic and alkaline media, CMSs have definite advantages over zeolites. In the present work. an effort {{has been made to}} develop suitable process conditions for synthesizing CMSs from the locally available bituminous coal. The coal was crushed, milled. and agglomerated with sulfate pulp waste liquor (SPWL) or coal-tar pitch (CTP) as the binders, and then carbonized in nitrogen atmosphere at 800 -degrees-C for about 60 minutes. In order to narrow down the pore mouth sizes. acetylene and benzene were each cracked separately at 800 -degrees-C to facilitate the deposition of coke on the char. Acetylene and benzene were cracked for 3 to 10 minutes, and 10 to 30 minutes. respectively. Acetylene cracked samples did not show good separation, probably because of over-coking in deeper locations. In contrast. benzene cracked samples were found to be highly suitable for CO 2 -CH 4 separation. The best result (i. e., uptake ratio of 39. 9) was obtained for feed benzene entrainment in N 2 of 1. 27 x 10 (- 4) g/ml, cracking time of 30 minutes, and this ratio was more than 10 times that of non-cocked sample. CMS samples produced using, SPWL as binder showed poor O 2 /N 2 uptake ratios throughout (1 to 1. 5), whereas samples with CTP as binder showed far more encouraging results, the best uptake ratio being 5. 5 for benzene-nitrogen feed stream containing 3. 508 x 10 (- 4) g/ml benzene and 5 minutes cracking time.

40|$|International audienceThe {{tail and}} paws in rodents are heat {{exchangers}} {{involved in the}} maintenance of core body temperature (T core). They are also {{the most widely used}} target organs to study acute or chronic ``models'' of pain. We describe the fluctuations of vasomotor tone in the tail and paws in conditions of <b>thermal</b> <b>neutrality</b> and the constraints of these physiological processes on the responses to thermal nociceptive stimuli, commonly used as an index of pain. Skin temperatures were recorded with a calibrated thermal camera to monitor changes of vasomotor tone in the tail and paws of awake and anesthetized rats. In thermoneutral conditions, the sympathetic tone fluctuated at a rate of two to seven cycles/h. Increased mean arterial blood pressure (MAP; similar to 46 mmHg) was followed by increased heart rate (HR; similar to 45 beats/min) within 30 s, vasoconstriction of extremities (3. 5 - 7 degrees C range) within 3 - 5 min, and increased T core (similar to 0. 7 degrees C) within 6 min. Decreased MAP was followed by opposite events. There was a high correlation between HR and T core recorded 5 - 6 min later. The reaction time of the animal's response to a radiant thermal stimulus-heat ramp (6 degrees C/s, 20 mm(2) spot) generated by a CO 2 laser-directed to the tail depends on these variations. Consequently, the fluctuations in tail and paw temperature thus represent a serious confound for thermal nociceptive tests, particularly when they are conducted at <b>thermal</b> <b>neutrality...</b>|$|E

Afterward, lambs were euthanized and BAT was dissected for mRNA measurement, histology and ex vivo experiments. LL newborns had lower central BAT and skin temperature under <b>thermal</b> <b>neutrality</b> and at 4 °C, and higher plasma norepinephrine concentration than LD newborns. In response to 4 °C, they had a pronounced decrease in skin temperature and did not increase plasma glycerol. BAT weight in LL newborns was about half of that of LD newborns.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the thermoregulatory response of dairy buffaloes in pre-milking and post-milking. To identify animal thermoregulatory capacity, skin surface temperatures were taken by an infrared thermometer (SST), a thermographic camera (MTBP) as well as respiratory rate records (RR). Black Globe and Humidity Index (BGHI), radiating thermal load (RTL) and enthalpy (H) were used to characterize the thermal environment.

40|$|General {{object of}} present experiments. The {{fact that the}} human body ad-justs itself to low {{environmental}} temperatures chiefly by constriction of the peripheral blood vessels, and to high atmospheric temperatures chiefly by increased secretion of sweat {{has long been a}} truism of physiology. We know 1, that physical regulation through constriction or dilatation of vessels is essentially a change in conductivity over the gradient between environ-mental and internal body temperature (Kleiber, 1932, Burton, 1934); and 2, that various segments of the body play relatively different roles in the elimination of heat (Maddock and Coller, 1933; Freeman, 1934). It has generally been assumed that insensible evaporative loss for subjects at rest is a roughly constant proportion of the total heat loss within the zone of <b>thermal</b> <b>neutrality</b> (Soderstrom and DuBois, 1917; Benedict and Root, 1926), provided the hydration of the body is normal (Manchester, 1931), the subjects not pathological (Lazlo and Schurmeyer, 1931), the humidity constant (Wiley and Newburgh, 1931), and the subjects in a post-absorp...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} the various {{approaches}} in understanding outdoor thermal comfort is presented. The emphasis on field surveys from around the world, particularly across Europe, enables us to understand thermal perception and evaluate outdoor thermal comfort conditions. The consistent low correlations between objective microclimatic variables, subjective thermal sensation and comfort outdoors, internationally, suggest that thermophysiology alone does not adequate describe these relationships. Focusing {{on the concept of}} adaptation, it tries to explain how this influences outdoor comfort, enabling us to inhabit and get satisfaction from outdoor spaces throughout the year. Beyond acclimatization and behavioral adaptation, through adjustments in clothing and changes to the metabolic heat, psychological adaptation plays a critical role to ensure thermal comfort and satisfaction with the outdoor environment. Such parameters include recent experiences and expectations; personal choice and perceived control, more important than whether that control is actually exercised; and the need for positive environmental stimulation suggesting that <b>thermal</b> <b>neutrality</b> is not a pre-requisite for thermal comfort. Ultimately, enhancing environmental diversity can influence thermal perception and experience of open spaces...|$|E

In moderately cold environments (around + 10 degreesC) ISO/DIS 7730 and ISO/DIS 11079 prescribe significantly different responses. Evaluation of the rationale behind the comfort criteria and the basic heat transfer equations in the two models reveals some clear differences.
