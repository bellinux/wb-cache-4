5|$|Cresswell {{occupied}} a rare position in seventeenth-century England, {{as a person}} of common birth who rose <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> high status as an independently wealthy, unmarried woman running a substantial business enterprise. She figures in a wide assortment of contemporary literature and songs, in ballads, poems, broadsides, novels and party pamphlets, often portrayed as a caricature of vice, a satirical figure of street commentary, sexual theatre and political bawdry.|$|E
5|$|Cresswell {{was in a}} rare {{position}} for many reasons. Although she was of common birth, a woman and unmarried, she rose <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> high status, running a large business enterprise. By mid-life she was an independently wealthy woman, connected across England to rich and powerful men in government and the court. Her network of services were in high demand, counter to the religious and social morals of the day.|$|E
5|$|In January 1894, the Fasci were outlawed and brutally {{repressed}} on {{the orders}} of Prime Minister Francesco Crispi. Many leaders were put in jail; Cascioferro fled to Tunis for a year. After serving his sentence {{for his role in}} the peasant unrest, Cascioferro returned <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> social power and pressured authorities in Palermo to put him in charge of granting emigration permits in the district of Corleone. According to Mafia historian Salvatore Lupo, Cascioferro was involved in clandestine emigration networks.|$|E

5|$|The {{family is}} named after Harold's father, Earl Godwin, who had risen <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> wealth and {{influence}} in the 1020s under Danish King Cnut the Great. In 1045 Godwin's daughter, Edith, married King Edward the Confessor, and by the mid-1050s Harold and his brothers had become dominant, almost monopolising the English earldoms. Godwin's origin is obscure. He was probably the son of Wulfnoth Cild, a South Saxon thegn, but Wulfnoth's ancestry is disputed. A few genealogists and historians argue that he was descended from Alfred the Great's elder brother, King Æthelred I (865–71), but almost all historians of Anglo-Saxon England reject this theory.|$|E

At present the pilots, though talented, performed more as individuals. After flying {{for the first time}} with them Bloomfield promised to have him allocated <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> Flight Commander. He formally took command of B flight on 14 August.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{childhood}} marked by ostracism from his family, {{as a young}} man Rainilaiarivony was elevated <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> high authority and confidence in the royal court, serving alongside his father and brother. He co-led a critical military expedition with Rainivoninahitriniony at the age of 24 and was promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the army following the death of the queen in 1861. In that position he oversaw continuing efforts to maintain royal authority in the outlying regions of Madagascar and acted as adviser to his brother, who had been promoted to Prime Minister in 1852. He also influenced the transformation of the kingdom's government from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional one, in which power was shared between the sovereign and the Prime Minister. Rainilaiarivony and Queen Rasoherina worked together to depose Rainivoninahitriniony for his abuses of office in 1864. Taking his brother's place as Prime Minister, Rainilaiarivony remained in power as Madagascar's longest-serving prime minister for the next 31years by marrying three queens in succession: Rasoherina, RanavalonaII and RanavalonaIII.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s Imogen became Benjamin Britten's musical assistant, moved to Aldeburgh, and began {{helping with the}} {{organisation}} of the annual Aldeburgh Festival. In 1956 she became joint {{artistic director of the}} festival, and during the following 20 years helped it <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> pre-eminence in British musical life. In 1964 she gave up her work as Britten's assistant, to resume her own compositional career and to concentrate on the preservation of her father's musical legacy. Imogen's own music is not widely known and has received little critical attention; much of it is unpublished and unperformed. The first recordings dedicated to her works, issued in 2009 and 2012, were warmly received by critics. She was appointed CBE in 1975 and received numerous academic honours. She died at Aldeburgh and is buried in the churchyard there.|$|E
5|$|Peng {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} generals active in defending the Jiangxi Soviet, taking a leading role in defeating Chiang Kai-shek's first three Encirclement Campaigns, from December 1930 – May 1931. His successes were outmatched only by Lin Biao. On November 7, Peng was named to the Central Military Commission and to the Central Executive Committee of the Jiangxi Soviet, the first time that he had been named <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> political leadership within the communist movement. After the consolidation of the Jiangxi Soviet, a number of USSR-trained Communist Party leaders arrived and took power in the Soviet: Peng, like most communist military leaders, supported their leadership until the Jiangxi Soviet was eventually overrun. In August 1933, Peng was named Vice-Chairman of the Central Military Commission; and, in January 1934, Peng was appointed as an alternate member to the Sixth CCP Central Committee. Peng continued the defense of the Jiangxi Soviet throughout the early 1930s. In August 1933, after the indecisive Fourth Encirclement Campaign, Peng broke through Kuomintang defenses and conquered a large area of western Fujian, capturing great quantities of arms and ammunition.|$|E
5|$|The Dresden meeting {{revealed}} that Austria's influence in Europe had reached its lowest point, and Metternich was now bent on re-establishing that influence by using {{what he considered}} strong ties with all sides in the war, proposing general peace talks headed by Austria. Over the next three months, he would slowly distance Austria from the French cause, while avoiding alliance with either Prussia or Russia, and remaining open to any proposal that would secure {{a place for the}} combined Bonaparte-Habsburg dynasty. This was driven by concern that if Napoleon were defeated, Russia and Prussia would stand to gain too much. Napoleon was intransigent, however, and the fighting (now officially the War of the Sixth Coalition) continued. Austria's alliance with France ended in February 1813, and Austria then moved <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> armed neutrality.|$|E

25|$|Those {{who passed}} the japgwa were {{originally}} given a crimson certificate, {{the same color}} obtained by those who passed the literary examination.

25|$|Under the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910), the {{examinations}} {{fell under}} three broad categories: the literary examinations (mun-gwa: 文科), military examinations (mugwa: 武科), and miscellaneous examinations (japgwa: 雜科) covering {{topics such as}} medicine, geography, astronomy, and translation.

25|$|Although his {{popularity}} {{at the regional}} level fluctuated greatly, {{it is believed that}} Rajagopalachari was able to exercise his stranglehold over provincial politics mainly because he was favoured by national leaders such as Gandhi, Patel and Nehru.
