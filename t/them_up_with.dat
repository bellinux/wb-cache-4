5|$|On 5 June 1956 two FDA {{officials}} {{arrived at}} Orgonon {{to supervise the}} destruction of the accumulators. Most of them had been sold by that time and another 50 were with Silvert in New York. Only three were at Orgonon. The FDA agents were not allowed to destroy them, only to supervise the destruction, so Reich's friends and his son, Peter, chopped <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> axes as the agents watched. Once they were destroyed, Reich placed an American flag on top of them.|$|E
5|$|After Point Grey and Point Orient {{were turned}} over to the RVN on 14 July only Point Cypress and Point Marone were left in Division 13. On that day the {{remaining}} two cutters were given orders to report to the lower Mekong Delta and provide support for operations in the Than Phu Secret Zone. On 19 and 20 July the crews of both cutters consisted of a full complement of 13 RVN sailors and 5 Coast Guardsmen including the commanding officers. Kit Carson Scouts were also embarked, making the decks very crowded. The Scouts were put ashore on a search and destroy mission and the cutters backed <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> gunfire from their decks and the cutter small boats. The raid was successful, netting several captured Viet Cong troops and boxes of documents. A week later both cutters with Australian Army explosive ordnance disposal soldiers aboard cruised the My Thanh River and destroyed fortifications.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile in Frankfurt, imprisoned {{biochemist}} David Robert Jones is {{visited by}} his lawyer Mr. Kohl (James Frain), who tells Jones {{that the job}} in Philadelphia was successful. Jones tells Kohl to wire Loeb another $100,000, and he makes a list of items he needs Kohl to bring on his next visit. Olivia visits Raul's wife Susan Lugo (Rosa Arredondo) and claims to have met her before as well, but Susan does not remember their meeting. She says the only people at a meeting Olivia describes were Raul, Susan, and John Scott (Mark Valley). Olivia realizes that she apparently still has his memories inside of her head, and is mixing <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> her own. Over at Massive Dynamic, Nina Sharp's (Blair Brown) attempts to delve into Scott's memories for information hit a dead end {{when they find out}} that crucial pieces of his memories are missing; they soon discover that the memories they need are in Olivia's mind.|$|E

5|$|In essence, the lbw law {{remained}} the same between 1839 and 1937, despite several campaigns to have it changed. An 1863 proposal to allow a batsman to be lbw if the ball hit his body at any point between the wickets, regardless of where the ball pitched or whether it would hit the wicket at all, came to nothing. There were few complaints until the proportion of lbw dismissals in county cricket began to increase during the 1880s. Until then, batsmen used their pads only to protect their legs; their use for any other purposes was considered unsporting, and some amateur cricketers did not wear them at all. As cricket became more organised and competitive, some batsmen began to use their pads as a second line of defence: they lined <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the ball so that if they missed with the bat, the ball struck the pad instead of the wicket. Some players took this further; if the delivery {{was not an easy}} one from which to score runs, they attempted no shot and allowed the ball to bounce safely off their pads. Arthur Shrewsbury was the first prominent player to use such methods, and others followed. Criticism of this practice was heightened by the increased quality and reliability of cricket pitches, which made batting easier, led to higher scores and created a perceived imbalance in the game.|$|E

25|$|Oysters are {{harvested}} by simply gathering {{them from their}} beds. In very shallow waters, they can be gathered by hand or with small rakes. In somewhat deeper water, long-handled rakes or oyster tongs are used to reach the beds. Patent tongs can be lowered on a line to reach beds that are too deep to reach directly. In all cases, the task is the same: the oysterman scrapes oysters into a pile, and then scoops <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the rake or tongs.|$|E

25|$|The mimicry of egg-spots is {{utilized}} by males for the fertilization process. Mouthbrooding females lay eggs and immediately snatch <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> their mouths. Over millions of years, male cichlids have evolved egg-spots {{to initiate the}} fertilization process more efficiently. When the females are snatching up the eggs into their mouth, the males gyrate their anal fins, which illuminates the egg-spots on his tail. Afterwards, the female, believing these are her eggs, places her mouth to the anal fin (specifically the genital papilla) of the male, which is when he discharges sperm into her mouth and fertilizes the eggs.|$|E
25|$|The {{striped hyena}} is {{primarily}} a scavenger, though it will occasionally attack and kill any defenseless animal it can overcome, and will supplement its diet with fruits. The spotted hyena, though it also scavenges occasionally, is an active pack hunter of medium to large sized ungulates, which it catches by wearing them down in long chases and dismembering them in a canid-like manner. The aardwolf {{is primarily a}}n insectivore, specialised for feeding on termites of the genus Trinervitermes and Hodotermes, which it consumes by licking <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> its long, broad tongue. An aardwolf can eat 300,000 Trinervitermes on a single outing.|$|E

25|$|Chris Foran {{then became}} only the fourth man to captain Park on three {{occasions}} {{as he took}} charge again for the 2010 season. An early highlight came in a home draw against Mobberley in which Ian Cooper and Australian batsman Adam Watson both scored centuries in the same innings, a record previously made almost 100 years earlier. However it ended up being another tough year as Park managed just four wins {{which seemed to be}} enough to keep <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a month to go. Unfortunately they lost their final five games which resulted in them losing their place in the Cheshire County Cricket League after thirteen seasons.|$|E
25|$|This species exists {{mostly in}} {{tropical}} areas with distinct rainy seasons, {{and the young}} hatch near {{the time of the}} first rains of the summer (July–August), after the preceding dry season and before the bodies of water where they live flood. In this stage of development of their young, mother American crocodiles exhibit a unique mode of parental care. During the hatching process, when the young American crocodiles are most vulnerable to predation, they will instinctively call out in soft, grunt-like croaks. These sounds trigger the female to attend to the nest, uncovering the eggs if they have been covered. Then she will aid the hatchlings in escaping their eggs and scoop <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> her mouth, carrying them to the closest water source.|$|E
25|$|Once the Hindenburg Line {{had been}} breached, the advance moved into less devastated areas where civilians were present, {{and when the}} divisional {{engineers}} {{were out of the}} line they helped to repair civilian homes. In the advance, they were rebuilding railway bridges, filling cratered roads and dealing with delayed-action mines. During the Battle of the Selle (17 October), the Staffordshire Bde put in a mock attack using dummy troops and tanks operated by the engineers. When there was confusion in 139th Bde's attack, Lt M.E. Thomas of 465th Fd Co, gathered a group of men of various units and led <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> his sappers to assist, where he took command of the flank infantry company. The engineers then built a strongpoint for the most advanced troops.|$|E

25|$|Warwickshire Bears {{jumped on}} the quarter-final train just as {{it seemed to be}} leaving the station, {{grabbing}} the ticket {{out of the hands of}} Somerset Sabres. Neil Carter and Ian Bell opened the batting and scored quickly, sending the score to 40 for 1, but part-timer William Durston got three wickets in quick succession to have three for four at one point. Trevor Penney then smashed three successive sixes off Durston to end with 35 not out off 13 balls. Thus, Warwickshire closed on 172 for 8, and patient bowling from Carter and Alex Loudon sent them crumbling to 89 for 6. Arul Suppiah and Durston paired up for 27 for the seventh wicket, but when Suppiah was bowled by Jonathan Trott it looked hopeless for Somerset. Jamie Anyon wrapped <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a hat-trick to end Somerset's innings on 125.|$|E
25|$|Adam Gilchrist, Simon Katich and Shane Warne all {{played a}} part in getting Australia past 100, with their scores in the 20s, but Harmison – coming back for a second spell – wrapped <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> {{variations}} in length along with his ever-reliant pace. He finished with five for 43, allowing Glenn McGrath to be stranded on 10 not out, and McGrath was to take centre stage when England batted. They survived six overs until tea, scoring ten runs, but McGrath, who bowled his usual accurate line and length and got the odd ball to move, reaped massive rewards. Marcus Trescothick fell first ball after tea, edging to slip, and Strauss fell in similar fashion three balls later. Michael Vaughan and Ian Bell were shaken up, but survived six overs – before McGrath started the torture again. They were both bowled, as was Andrew Flintoff, and England had lost five wickets for 21 runs, with five of their front line batsmen out in single figures. However, Kevin Pietersen and Geraint Jones gave England a glimmer of hope, pairing up for 58 before Brett Lee's reverse-swing with the old ball induced a backward edge off Jones' bat to Adam Gilchrist. Ashley Giles hit two quick boundaries, but a short pacy ball from Lee undid him, and England were 92 for 7 overnight – needing 98 for the last three wickets to get level with Australia.|$|E
25|$|Dessalines and Pétion {{remained}} {{allied with}} France until they switched sides again, in October 1802, and {{fought against the}} French. As Leclerc laid dying of yellow fever and heard that Christophe and Dessalines had joined the rebels, he reacted by ordering all of the blacks living in Le Cap be killed by drowning them in the harbour. In November, Leclerc died of yellow fever, like much of his army. His successor, the Vicomte de Rochambeau, fought an even more brutal campaign. Rochambeau waged a near-genocidal campaign against the Haitians, simply killing everybody who was black. Rochambeau imported about 15, 000 attack dogs from Jamaica, who had trained to savage blacks and mulattoes. At the Bay of Le Cap, Rochambeau had blacks drowned so that no-one would eat fish from the bay for months afterward as no one wished to eat the fish that had eaten human flesh. Bonaparte, hearing {{that most of his}} army in St. Domingue had died of yellow fever and the French only held Port-au-Prince, Le Cap and Les Cayes sent about 20, 000 reinforcements to Rochambeau. Dessalines matched Rochambeau in his vicious cruelty. At Le Cap, when Rochambeau hanged 500 blacks, Dessalines replied by killing 500 whites and sticking their heads on spikes all around Le Cap, so that the French could see what he was planning on doing to them. Rochambeau's atrocities helped rally many former French loyalists to the rebel cause. Many on both sides had come to see the war as a race war where no mercy was to be given, and the Haitians were just as brutal as the French, as they burned French prisoners alive, cut <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> axes, or tied to a board and sawed them into two. Having sold the Louisiana Territory to the United States in April 1803, Napoleon began to lose interest in his failing ventures in the Western Hemisphere. He was more concerned about France's European enemies such as Great Britain and Prussia. With that, he withdrew a majority of the French forces in Haiti to counter the possibility of an invasion from Prussia, Britain, and Spain on a weakened France.|$|E
