If she had not picked any one yet, why he was just the man. He had forgotten to tell her the day he took her ashore that {{he had been in the}} country years before and knew all about it.

He <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> a minute and decides from that point to assume Elvis' identity and to do everything just the way Elvis had. The following day, a nervous Gary (wearing Elvis' clothes from the day before) goes into Sun Studio and is received by the office manager, who lets him know that everyone is already waiting for him in the recording booth. As Sam Phillips is preparing his recording equipment, Gary plays a little of [...] "That's All Right" [...] to the other band members who immediately join in. Phillips interrupts the trio, but tells [...] "Elvis" [...] to keep it up. As the song is playing, the scene flashes forward to 1970s Las Vegas where we find Gary (as Elvis) talking to a woman in his hotel room. He tells her that he did all the songs, all the movies, as closely as he remembered. He questions whether or not the real Elvis would've been a better King than he would've been, or if there would've even been a King at all. He says that he has terrible dreams and that he talks to Elvis all the time and that Elvis tells him that he still owes him. He even goes as {{far as to say that}} Elvis would have liked Vegas. The woman, who turns out to be a younger Sandra, just tells him that he is tired and to not worry, no one would ever take his place, he was the King, the only King. He then sends her off with a scarf and a kiss. After she leaves, Gary sits in a chair facing a window overlooking the Vegas Strip.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{starts from}} the presupposition that moral codes {{often do not}} suffice to make agents {{understand}} their moral responsibility. We will illustrate this statement with a concrete example of engineers who design a truck’s trailer and who do not think traffic safety {{is part of their}} responsibility. This opinion clashes with a common supposition that designers in fact should do all that is in their power to ensure safety in traffic. In our opinion this shows the need for a moral philosophy that helps engineers to interpret their responsibility and <b>think</b> more critically <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>For</b> this purpose we will explore the moral philosophy of Alasdair MacIntyre, which is particularly interesting because he locates the beginning of moral thinking in the daily practice of a profession. This is consistent with the history of moral codes, for codes are also the product of moral reflection by professionals. We will use MacIntyre’s philosophy to (1) explain what is wrong with the designers’ understanding of their responsibility and (2) show a possible way to bring their reflection to a more self-critical level. We will also inspect MacIntyre’s proposal critically...|$|R

Slater allegedly agreed to join Roop's group but secretly informed Florida promoter Eddie Graham who then warned Fuller about their plans to steal the Knoxville territory.
