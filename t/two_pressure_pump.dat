50|$|The YF-100 is a pump-fed {{oxidizer}} rich {{staged combustion}} rocket engine. It has adjustable thrust and variable mixture ratio. Its preburner burns all the LOX mass flow {{with a bit}} of kerosene to generate hot gas that powers the single turbine.

A generic diesel turbocharger configuration was chosen, which has an upstream duct inlet and a downstream blade ring outlet. Three identical water injectors were evenly distributed in the circumferential direction and located upstream of the blades. Simulation considered water injection at an angle of 30 ° from the centerline with <b>two</b> water <b>pump</b> <b>pressures</b> of 4 bars and 8 bars. The process of liquid droplet break-up has been modeled using the Blob model for primary break-up and the cascade atomization breakup (CAB) and the Reitz and Diwakar breakup (RDB) models for secondary break-up.

40|$|Aquatic {{respiration}} in many fishes is {{a mechanical}} ballet in which water is pumped from the oropharyngeal chamber, across the gills {{and into the}} parabranchial chambers. At the same time, blood is pumped through the gills, where it picks up oxygen from the water and loses carbon dioxide. The movement of water across the gills involves the action of <b>two</b> pumps: a <b>pressure</b> <b>pump</b> that pushes water across the gills from the oropharyngeal to the parabranchial cavity, and a suction pump that draws water across the gills from the oropharyngeal into the parabranchial chamber (Hughes and Morgan, 1973). A synchrony between these two pumps can theoretically yield a continuous flow of water across the gills in spite of discontinuous flow into the mouth {{and out of the}} gill slit(s). The blood flow in the respiratory structures of the gills (secondary lamellae) is in the opposite direction to that of water (Grigg and Read, 1971; Scheid and Piiper, 1976). The continuous flow of water across the gills requires two cyclical pumps; one must be active while the other is refilling. The buccal <b>pressure</b> <b>pump</b> is clearly present in all fishes; however, the suction pump is not. In the bony fishes (Osteichthyes), abduction of the operculum serves as the suction pump (Hughes, 1960 b; Hughes and Shelton, 1958). It is less obvious in cartilaginous fishes (Chondrichthyes) where the motive force for the suction pump comes from, although the elastic recoil of the branchial skeleton and small muscles that extend the elements of the gill arch may be responsible (Hughes and Ballintijn, 1965). Flow is difficult to measure inside a fish’s head, so relative pressures in the oropharyngeal and parabranchial (or opercular) cavities have been used as an indicator of flow direction. In experiments on bony and cartilaginous fishes, these measures of pressure have been used to indicate that the dominant flow pattern is a continuous...|$|R

40|$|Chemotaxis, {{the ability}} of cells to detect and migrate {{directly}} towards a source of a chemically active agent, {{is the result of}} a sophisticated interplay of proteins within a complex regulatory network. However, partially redundant pathways that simultaneously mediate chemotaxis and dynamic protein distributions complicate the experimental identication of distinct signaling cascades and their inuence on chemotactic migration. Yet, increasingly precise generation and rapid modication of chemotactic stimuliin microuidic devices promise further insight into the basic principles of cellular feedback signaling. I developed a Chemotactic Gradient Generator (CGG) for the exposure of living cells to chemotactic gradient elds with alternating gradient direction based on a double T-junction microuidic chamber. A large extension of the concentration gradients enables the parallel exposure of several dozens of cells to identical chemotactic stimuli, allowing for a reliable quantitative analysis of the chemotactic migration behavior. <b>Two</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>pumps</b> and a syringe pump facilitate accurate control of the inow velocities at the individual ow chamber inlets, pivotal for precise manipulation of the chemotactic stimuli. The CGG combines homogeneous gradients over a width of up to 300 µm and rapid alterations of gradient direction with switching frequencies up to 0. 7 Hz. Fast gradient switching in our experimental design facilitates cell stimulation at the intrinsic time scales of their chemotactic response as demonstrated by a gradual increase in the switching frequency of the gradient direction. We eventually observe a "chemotactically trapped" state of Dictyostelium discoideum (D. discoideum) cells at a switching rate of 0. 01 Hz. Here, gradient switching proves too fast for the cells to respond to the altered gradient direction by migration. In contrast, we observe oscillatory runs at switching frequencies of less than 0. 02 Hz. We distinguish between re-polymerizing cells that exhibit an internal re-organization of the actin cortex in response to chemotactic stimulation and stably polarized cells that gradually adjust their leading edge when the gradient is switched. To experimentally characterize both response types, we record cell shape and the intracellular distribution of actin polymerization activity. Cell shape is readily described by the eccentricity of the cell and to record F-actin polymerization dynamics we introduce a fluorescence distribution moment (FDM). Accurate description of the migratory response behavior facilitates a quantitative analysis of the inuence of both the experimental boundary conditions such as gradient shape, ongoing starvation of the cells, and in particular the inuence of distinct signaling cascades on chemotactic migration. Here, we demonstrate this ability of the GCC by inhibition of PI 3 -Kinase with LY 294002. PI 3 -Kinase initiates the formation of fresh pseudopods in the direction of the chemotactic gradient and therefore is one of the key signaling pathways mediating the chemotactic response. In shallow gradients and with ongoing starvation of the cells, we find a decreased ratio of re-polymerizing cells, pointing towards a diminished influence of PI 3 -Kinase. After inhibition of PI 3 -Kinase, cell re-polymerization in response to a switch in gradient direction is hindered at 5 h of starvation, whereas at 7 h of starvation evidence is found that chemotactic migration is more efficient. We observe the astonishing result that in dependency of the boundary conditions of the experiment inhibition of PI 3 -Kinase promotes an effective chemotactic response. Thus, the CGG for the rst time facilitates a quantitative analysis of the starvation time dependent effect of PI 3 -Kinase inhibition on D. discoideum chemotaxis...|$|R
