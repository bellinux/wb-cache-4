The County Commission initially passed a development moratorium to block the project but changed their decision after being threatened with a federal lawsuit. In regard to the local opposition, Eric Michener, the project coordinator for the GCWP, told a reporter, [...] "I don't think we've run into this vibrant level of misunderstanding before". The group failed to receive an endorsement from the county commission when it sought a $38 million <b>tax-exempt</b> <b>bond</b> from the state.

40|$|I n a {{reversal}} of the rapid upward trend of recent years, the face amount of long-term private activity <b>tax-exempt</b> <b>bonds</b> in 1986 decreased to $ 29. 9 billion. This volume, which represented a 75 percent decrease from the 1985 volume of $ 122. 0 billion was the smallest since 1981. (Private activity bonds are bonds issued by State and local Governments that provide a benefit for private businesses, organizations, or individuals.) In contrast, the face amount of public purpose <b>tax-exempt</b> <b>bonds</b> continued to increase in 1986 to $ 115. 5 billion. However, as shown in Figure A, the total dollar volume of all types of <b>tax-exempt</b> <b>bonds</b> declined by 33 percent in 1986 to $ 145. 7 billion [1]. The primary factor affecting the issuance of <b>tax-exempt</b> <b>bonds</b> in 1986 was tax reform, which had four main effects: 1. The issuance of a considerable volume of <b>tax-exempt</b> <b>bonds</b> was accelerated in 1985 in anticipation of restrictions included in the House bill that went into effect on December 31, 1985...|$|R

50|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>tax-exempt</b> <b>bonds,</b> or private {{activity}} bonds, {{is to promote}} job creation and increase economic development in local areas; therefore, they {{are not limited to}} housing creation. These bonds are issued by state Housing Finance Agencies (similar to LIHTCs) or by local government development agencies. Since the interest on the bonds is exempt from state and local taxes, lenders who purchase the bonds pass on this savings onto borrowers through lower interest rates. <b>Tax-exempt</b> <b>bonds</b> are similar to conventional loans in that the borrower must pay back the principle plus interest to the lender; however, <b>tax-exempt</b> <b>bonds</b> typically have longer financing periods compared to conventional loans. In general, this type of bonding is utilized for projects over one million dollars.|$|R

After New York City’s near-default in 1975, investors flocked to Van Kampen’s insured unit investment trusts. In 1982, the company broke records in the industry by introducing a $125 million Insured Municipal Income Trust (IMIT), soon followed by an even larger $128.5 IMIT. By 1983, the company now known as Van Kampen Merritt, Inc. had sold nearly $7 billion of trusts and was the nation’s third-largest firm in that arena.|$|E

David Lynch initiated an effort in 2003 to raise $1 billion for palace construction. In 2007, the GCWP applied to the Colorado Health Facilities Authority, a private group that serves as a vehicle for financing construction by non-profit healthcare institutions, for an issue of $55 million in tax-exempt bonds to finance construction of Peace Palaces in 21 cities, and the purchase of an organic farm in Goshen, New York. The GCWP would be responsible for the debt and interest. In order to get IRS approval for the <b>tax-exempt</b> <b>bond,</b> the GCWP had to get endorsements from the city councils or state authorities of the jurisdictions where it planned to build. A 2008 report states that $40 million was borrowed to build nine Peace Palaces, and was secured with $250 million in real estate assets.|$|E
5000|$|In 1983, Mattox {{was indicted}} for {{commercial}} bribery and prosecuted by Travis County District Attorney Ronnie Earle, a Democrat {{close to the}} late Governor Ann Richards. Earle later prosecuted the Republican congressional leader Tom DeLay. Like the DeLay prosecution, the political background of the Mattox prosecution related to an attempt to conceal the delivery of corporate funds to an election campaign. Mattox had received a campaign contribution of $125,000 from his sister Janice, a Dallas lawyer. Janice Mattox in turn had obtained a similar amount from Seafirst Bank in Seattle, which had close ties to Mattox supporter Clinton Manges, a controversial South Texas rancher-oilman who was the successor to George Parr, the corrupt [...] "Duke of Duval". Manges was co-plaintiff with the state (represented by Mattox) in major litigation against Mobil Oil Company. Mobil had attempted to depose Janice Mattox concerning the Seafirst transaction, which led Mattox to threaten Mobil's law firm, Fulbright & Jaworski, with loss of its <b>tax-exempt</b> <b>bond</b> practice, a power held by the attorney general in Texas. Secretly recorded by {{the recipient of the}} threats, Mattox did not deny threatening the law firm, nor did he deny the Seafirst transactions, his defense being based on the legal definition of the crime of [...] "commercial bribery." [...] After a long trial, Mattox was acquitted.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The thesis {{discusses}} {{the differences between}} two financing options for university real estate projects under Public-Private Partnerships: 501 (c) 3 and 63 - 20 <b>tax-exempt</b> <b>bond</b> processes. Prior to the case interviews, this thesis identifies and compares the differences between two <b>tax-exempt</b> <b>bond</b> programs, their historical backgrounds, conceptions, legal regulations and constraints. This thesis also formulates a project process model, a cash flow model, and a financing structure model for P 3 practitioners using 501 (c) 3 and 63 - 20 <b>tax-exempt</b> <b>bond</b> financing. A series of interviews was designed and conducted with project managers, non-profit organization directors, financing professionals, and University Real Estate Office staff.
