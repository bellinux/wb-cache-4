5|$|In February 1998, Archie Comics adapted Nights into Dreams into a three-issue {{comic book}} miniseries {{to test whether}} or not a Nights comic would sell well in North America. The first miniseries was loosely based on the game, with Nights being {{specifically}} identified as a male despite the character's androgynous design. The company later released a second three-issue miniseries, continuing the story of the first, but the series did not gain enough sales to warrant an ongoing series. The series would later be added <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> of guest franchises featured in Archie Comics' Worlds Unite crossover between its Sonic the Hedgehog and Mega Man titles.|$|E

5|$|The Gospel of the Hebrews is {{preserved}} in fragments quoted or summarized by various early Church Fathers. The {{full extent of}} the original gospel is unknown; according <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> of canonical and apocryphal works drawn up in the 9th century known as the Stichometry of Nicephorus, the gospel was 2200 lines, just 300 lines shorter than Matthew. Based on the surviving fragments, the overall structure of the gospel appears to have been similar to the canonical ones. It consisted of a narrative of the life of Jesus which included his baptism, temptation, transfiguration, last supper, crucifixion, and resurrection. The gospel also contained sayings of Jesus. The events in the life of Jesus have been interpreted in a way that reflects Jewish ideas present in a Hellenistic cultural environment.|$|E

5|$|In summer 1429, the Thessalonians sent {{a second}} embassy to Venice to {{complain}} about the restrictions placed on entry and exit from the city, continued violations of their rights, extortion by the Venetian authorities, the poor supply situation, the neglect of repairing the city's fortifications and the lack of military stores, and the Venetian mercenaries that were in contact with the Turks outside the walls. On 14 July, the Great Council gave mostly reassuring answers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> of 31 demands, but increasing dissatisfaction of the Greek population with Venetian rule was evident. The eyewitness John Anagnostes reports that by the winter of 1429, {{the majority of the population}} had come to favour a surrender to the Turks. Sultan Murad was aware of the situation inside the walls, and twice sent Christian officers in his service into the city to incite a rebellion against the Venetians. However, as Anagnostes writes, the population was by that time so reduced in number, and divided amongst itself, that no common cause could be made. Furthermore, the Thessalonians were afraid of the Venetians, as they had recruited a special force of guards, the Tzetarioi, and given them the authority to kill anyone advocating a surrender.|$|E
5|$|President Obama {{signed the}} Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) on 23 March 2010. As of 1 August 2011, female {{contraception}} was added <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> of preventive services {{covered by the}} ACA that would be provided without patient co-payment. The federal mandate applied to all new health insurance plans in all states from 1 August 2012. Grandfathered plans {{did not have to}} comply unless they changed substantially. To be grandfathered, a group plan must have existed or an individual plan must have been sold before President Obama signed the law; otherwise they were required to comply with the new law. The Guttmacher Institute noted that even before the federal mandate was implemented, twenty-eight states had their own mandates that required health insurance to cover the prescription contraceptives, but the federal mandate innovated by forbidding insurance companies from charging part of the cost to the patient.|$|E
