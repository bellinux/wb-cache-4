40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the degree of improvement in the range of movement in <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>joint,</b> sitting ability, and overall ambulation in patients with heterotopic ossification of <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> who underwent surgical excision of ectopic bone. Between 1999 and 2006, 14 patients (23 joints) with significant heterotopic ossification of <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> that required surgery were evaluated. We compared the range of movement in <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>joint,</b> sitting ability, and overall ambulation in the preoperative and postoperative periods using the Fuller and Keenan classification systems. Range of movement increased in 82 % of cases (19 <b>knee</b> <b>joints).</b> Sitting ability improved in 13 patients (93 %). Postoperatively, ambulation in eight patients (57 %) was remarkably superior. In conclusion, resection of heterotopic ossification may significantly improve the range of movement in <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>joint,</b> sitting ability, and overall ambulation...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{kinematics}} of <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> are load-dependent; <b>the</b> {{length of}} the lever arm of the ex-tensor mechanism and the pathway of the instant center of rotation vary with external load. This study was con-ducted {{to determine if the}} maximum extensor torque-generating capacity of <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> is dependent on the distance from <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> at which <b>the</b> external force resisting extension is located. Maximum isometric ex-tensor torques were measured at 90 and 30 degrees of <b>knee</b> flexion while <b>the</b> distance from <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> to <b>the</b> resisting force was varied. Our results demonstrated that the subjects generated larger maximum extensor torques, at both 90 and 30 degrees of <b>knee</b> flexion, when <b>the</b> external resisting force was positioned farther distal to <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>joint.</b> This increase was as large as 50 pe...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: A fluorogenic peptide probe-immobilized {{diagnostic}} kit {{was used to}} analyze MMP activity in the synovial fluids (SFs) from patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and acute inflammatory conditions of <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>joint.</b> Methods: <b>The</b> MMP {{diagnostic kit}} containing a polymer-conjugated MMP probe immobilized on a 96 -well plate was utilized for high-throughput screening of MMP activity in SFs from OA patients (n = 33) and patients with acute inflammatory conditions of <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> (n = 5). Results: Compared to SF from OA patients, SF from patients with acute inflammatory conditions of <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> presented stronger NIR fluorescent signals.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> is {{basically}} a hinge joint with the main movement of flexion-extension.

At terminal extension, <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> is slightly hyperextended and stabilized with <b>the</b> <b>tightening</b> of <b>the</b> cruciate and collateral ligaments.

[Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the effects of kinesiology taping on reposition-ing error of <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> after quadriceps muscle fatigue. [Subjects] Thirty healthy adults with no orthopaedic or neurological problems participated in this study.

40|$|The {{temporal}} {{pattern of}} the anterior-posterior force acting at <b>the</b> human <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> during walking is determined in the present study. A three-dimensional anatomically based dynamics model, which includes the bones and the muscles working across <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>joint,</b> is developed and the redundant inverse dynamics problem is formulated. The muscle redundancy is resolved by {{reducing the number of}} unknowns based on certain logical assumptions. In addition, a parametric study is conducted to study the effect of antagonistic muscle activity on the joint force. The developed dynamics model is then exercised to calculate <b>the</b> anterior-posterior <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> force for normal and ACL-deficient <b>knees.</b> <b>The</b> anterior-posterior <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> force obtained from <b>the</b> normal <b>knee</b> analysis indicates that a posterior force is present {{for the majority of the}} gait cycle with a maximum force of 0. 25 BW (body weight), whereas anterior force acts shortly after the beginning of the stance phase reaching a maximum of 0. 4 BW. Among the muscles working across <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>joint,</b> <b>the</b> quadriceps, gastrocnemius and the tensor fascia latae produce an anterior force at <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> whereas <b>the</b> hamstrings, sartorius and the graclilis generate a posterior force. For <b>the</b> ACL-deficient <b>knee,</b> <b>the</b> results reveal that it is possible for patients to adapt to the injury by changing their walking pattern to avoid or minimize quadriceps activation in the stance phase, thus reducing or entirely avoiding the anterior force at <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>joint.</b> <b>The</b> study also reveals that it is necessary to strengthen the hamstring muscles for the rehabilitation of <b>the</b> ACL-deficient <b>knee</b> patients to reduce the anterior force at <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>joint...</b>|$|R

Therefore, {{the objective of the}} treatment of osteoarthritis is to reduce the pain and a progression of the disease. To achieve these aims, conservative or surgical methods are used.
