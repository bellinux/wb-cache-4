5000|$|As Behavior Analysis grew larger, {{a growing}} number of {{scholars}} began to believe that Behavior Analysis had outgrown its place in Psychology and {{that it was time to}} establish a separate discipline. Makram Khalil Samaan gave expression to this belief in 1973 when he wrote, [...] "It is <b>time</b> <b>now</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> scientific analysis of behavior to call for its own scientific discipline. It is contradictory to its function, objective, methods and content to stay within the realm of psychology." [...] Mr. Samaan suggested that the scientific analysis of behavior become a separate scientific discipline named [...] "behaviorology".|$|E

Every RJ and judge and ITO technical official needs to be suspended. That’s the only way it’s going to change,” the official said.|$|E

50|$|The Ark Arena is {{described}} {{as an attempt to}} destroy a being known as the Qualia before it destroys every single timespace that the Ark Arena has created by travelling back and forth through <b>time,</b> <b>now</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 2003rd time. It is a place to train chosen couples from different parallel time spaces, eventually joining forces in order to defeat the Qualia. The Ark is designed to return to 10,000 years in the past when a couple is chosen as worthy, to germinate a new, genetically superior race. This process then repeats periodically, theoretically making contestants stronger at each Ark Arena contest, in the hopes to be powerful enough to face the Qualia itself in battle. It is also possible for the Ark to send a couple to the meeting point of the Qualia in another time space, thus making possible the meeting of couples from different time spaces.|$|E
50|$|Originally it {{was planned}} {{to open in}} summer 2003, but the big success of Finding Nemo forced the studio to move the release date one more <b>time,</b> <b>now</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Thanksgiving holiday season also putting in {{production}} over 30 theatrical shorts (not only Looney Tunes, also some Tom and Jerry cartoons - many story-boarded and directed by co-creator Joe Barbera and Hanna-Barbera veteran Iwao Takamoto- such as The Karate Guard) However, the release date of the film proved fatal to the film's performance. On the family front, the film was sandwiched between the releases of Elf and The Cat in the Hat, resulting in Looney Tunes: Back in Action being lost in the shuffle. It {{should also be noted}} that this film was released the same month as another Warner Bros. film The Matrix Revolutions, which the studio put more advertising money behind; and a few weeks before the much-hyped release of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (which like Elf, it was coincidentally distributed by New Line Cinema -then a sister company to WB-, which would later be folded into Warner Bros.). Only the barest minimum of promotions were done to advertise the film, limited to advertising with the film's promotional partners, very few television ads, and the release of very little merchandise directly based on the film. Additionally, the film was released in a period in which international tension caused by the Iraq War caused audiences to not want to see action films for some time, and retained a PG rating -now considered to be a children-focused rating- (which alienated its target teen audience). All of these factors made the movie result in a box-office flop (although getting positive reviews), forcing Warner Bros. to reorganize the entire cartoon unit, now focused on television. Only 11 of the shorts were completed and the Looney Tunes shorts have been released on DVD, while the Tom and Jerry cartoons were shown as part of Tom and Jerry Tales (except for The Karate Guard which received limited theatrical release in 2005).
