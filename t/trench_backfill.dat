50|$|Most state {{transportation}} {{agencies have}} used flowable fill mainly as a <b>trench</b> <b>backfill</b> for storm drainage and utility lines on street and highway projects. Flowable fill {{has also been}} used to backfill abutments and retaining walls, fill abandoned pipelines and utility vaults, , and settled areas, and help to convert abandoned bridges into culverts. The most frequent use of flowable fill is reported in the states of Minnesota, Maryland, Michigan, Iowa, and Indiana.|$|E

However, the increasing need to preserve resources and to use recovered and recycled materials led to the consideration of using gypsum as a utility <b>trench</b> <b>backfill</b> material. Thus a range of mixtures containing waste gypsum were investigated. During this study {{it was found that}} mixes containing waste gypsum, limestone quarry dust and ordinary Portland cement complied with the existing Specifications for <b>trench</b> <b>backfill</b> in terms of unconfined compressive strength as well as durability in respect of loss of strength on soaking and freeze thaw.

40|$|A large-deformation {{numerical}} methodology {{is applied}} to simulate the interaction effects for a pipeline installed in a <b>trench</b> <b>backfilled</b> with loosely deposited dry sand, focusing on shallow buried pipelines subjected to lateral displacements relative to the surrounding soil. Based on the backfill-pipeline deformation mode under shallow embedment conditions, described in previous experimental studies, analyses are performed while considering only the critical state shear strength parameters of the backfill. The numerical methodology is validated against experimental full-scale test measurements from the literature, for pipelines buried in uniform dry loose and medium sand. Parametric analyses are performed to generate approximate formulas and charts for calculating (i) the maximum force on the pipeline and (ii) the minimum trench dimensions to eliminate interaction with the surrounding natural ground. Application of the proposed approach in the prediction of independent full-scale test results for a pipeline embedded in a shallow trench demonstrates its effectiveness, and underlines the effect of trench dimensioning on {{the response of the}} pipeline...|$|R
40|$|A {{lightweight}} fill {{was produced}} by blending expanded polystyrene (EPS) beads and sands in proportions. Such formed granular geomaterials, known as sand-EPS lightweight fills, have potentials of being lightweight compared to traditional fills, thus are suitable for many infrastructure works where less overburdens are expected, e. g., utilities <b>trench</b> <b>backfills.</b> Consolidated drained triaxial compression (TC) tests were conducted on the lightweight fills to observe materials' stress-strain relationships, specifically, the stress-strain variations associated with the mixing ratios of EPS beads. EPS beads were incorporated into the mixtures based on their mass ratios over sands, i. e., 0. 5 %, 1. 5 % and 2. 5 %. It was found that confining pressures and mixing proportions played important roles in affecting the stress-strain behaviors of lightweight fills. The materials underwent shear contraction, which {{is related to the}} inclusion of EPS beads. The constitutive law of the lightweight fills was derived based on Cam-clay model and modified Cam-clay model, and verified by the test results. An Deng and Yang Xiao[URL]...|$|R
40|$|Pick excavatability of {{controlled}} low-strength materials was experimentally studied 10 {{to circumvent the}} fact that current classification systems or empirical excavatability criteria lack relevance (they do not refer to digging facilities and depend on the mix design and the granular skeleton of the material). Manual excavation is separated into two steps: {{the impact of the}} pick and decompaction. This was analysed by a mechanical approach. Energy is mainly consumed during the first step. A laboratory punching test was therefore proposed to evaluate excavatability (a confined cylindrical specimen was loaded by a cylindrical punch). Results were compared between the mechanised and the manual pick excavation tests on field <b>trenches</b> <b>backfilled</b> with air-entrained mortars or very lean concretes. These comparisons confirmed that a limited compressive strength was an indicator of excavatability.

30|$|The Finite Element Analysis is an {{advanced}} method for numerical solutions where the region of interest is geometrically defined by nodes and represented by “finite” geometric units. A geometric model is solved as a mathematical model and the behavior is described by differential equations and boundary conditions. The performance of flexible pipe with non-uniform soil support was modeled by Zarghamee (1986) as a cylindrical shell embedded in an elastic foundation. It {{was found that the}} internal pipe pressure did not mitigate the flexural strains since the invert induced by haunch support was inadequate. Zhan and Ranjani (1997) implemented finite element analysis to evaluate the effect of different <b>trench</b> <b>backfill</b> materials, as well as pipe burial depth, on the performance of buried PVC and ductile pipes. The analysis showed that the use of Controlled Low Strength Material (CLSM) a <b>trench</b> <b>backfill</b> instead of traditional materials, such as sand and clay, resulted in significantly reduced stress on PVC pipe under traffic loading. This was due to the high elastic modulus of CLSM. McGrath (1998) conducted a study on the soil-pipe interaction behavior during construction of flexible and rigid pipes. It was concluded that pipe performance is greatly affected by installation methods and soil properties (i.e. compaction and backfill characteristics).|$|E

30|$|The {{performance}} of pipelines {{is influenced by}} the <b>trench</b> <b>backfill,</b> and the natural soil surrounding the trench. The surrounding backfill material provides considerable support for underground flexible pipelines. It is generally understood that the narrower the trench, the lighter the load applied on the pipe. However, in the case of flexible pipes, the pipe tends to rely heavily on the surrounding soil to carry the applied loads. A flexible pipe principally derives its resistance strength from the passive pressures induced by the relative movement of the sides of the pipe against the surrounding soil (Moser, 1990).|$|E

40|$|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) {{examined}} {{the waste stream}} from a water jet cutting operation, to evaluate the possible reuse of waste garnet sand. The sand is a cutting agent used to shape a variety of materials, including metals. Nearly 70, 000 pounds of waste sand is generated annually by the cutting operation. The Environmental Protection Department evaluated two potential reuses for the spent garnet sand: backfill in utility trenches; and as a concrete constituent. In both applications, garnet waste would replace the sand formerly purchases by LLNL for these purposes. Findings supported the reuse of waste garnet sand in concrete, but disqualified its proposed application as <b>trench</b> <b>backfill.</b> Waste sand stabilized in ac concrete matrix appeared to present no metals-leaching hazard; however, unconsolidated sand in trenches could potentially leach metals in concentrations high enough to threaten ground water quality.

40|$|Controlled low {{strength}} materials (CLSMs) are engineered, cement based {{materials of}} {{growing interest in}} all <b>trench</b> <b>backfilling</b> and bedding applications where low stiffness, strength and density are required. Although 50 {{years have passed since}} its first application, the technology has been the source of continuous innovation. The challenge today concerns the excessive and undesirable long-term gain in strength of current CLSMs available on the market which leads to difficulties in the event of future removal and to unbalanced stress strain behavior with surrounding soils. In this investigation, the authors present a long-term laboratory study aimed at the creation of new formulations for pavement applications with the objective of avoiding or limiting any gain in stiffness and resistance over time. For this purpose, a rapid hardening cement {{has been used as a}} substitute for Portland cement. The particular formulation of cement adopted presents many advantages in terms of rapid set, high early strength development and insignificant gain in strength over long periods. All the mixtures studied were subjected to static and dynamic triaxial tests taking the mechanical characteristics of a reference granular soil as the mix design target for new CLSM formulations.

40|$|Ice gouging or scour may damage {{structures}} {{buried in}} seabeds, hence {{research on this}} subject is important. Numerical modelling {{is one of the}} most flexible and least costly methods of studying ice gouging. Previously, information on existing numerical models and their results was scattered in the literature. A new database has been created that tabulates this information. The database can be used to search numerical results and analyze knowledge gaps and correlations that might exist, in order to better understand and further advance knowledge of ice gouging phenomena. The database contains information on 206 runs from 18 major numerical studies. Using the database, knowledge gaps have been assessed. A list has been made of topics which were given little attention despite their probable importance, including deformable ice keel, different-from-seabed <b>trench</b> <b>backfill</b> soil, and simultaneous interaction of pore water and soil matrix in cohesionless seabeds. The available numerical model results show that pre-set gouge depth and the maximum depth of subgouge soil deformation are nearly linearly correlated.

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{forensic}} investigations of problems across Iowa, a research study was developed aimed at providing solutions to identified problems through better management and optimization of the available pavement geotechnical materials and through ground improvement, soil reinforcement, and other soil treatment techniques. The overall goal was worked out through simple laboratory experiments, such as particle size analysis, plasticity tests, compaction tests, permeability tests, and strength tests. A review of the problems suggested three areas of study: pavement cracking due to improper management of pavement geotechnical materials, permeability of mixed-subgrade soils, and settlement of soil above the pipe due to improper compaction of the backfill. This resulted in the following three areas of study: (1) The optimization and management of earthwork materials through general soil mixing of various select and unsuitable soils and a specific example of optimization of materials in earthwork construction by soil mixing; (2) An investigation of the saturated permeability of compacted glacial till in relation to validation and prediction with the Enhanced Integrated Climatic Model (EICM); and (3) A field investigation and numerical modeling of culvert settlement. For each area of study, a literature review was conducted, research data were collected and analyzed, and important findings and conclusions were drawn. It was found that optimum mixtures of select and unsuitable soils can be defined that allow the use of unsuitable materials in embankment and subgrade locations. An improved model of saturated hydraulic conductivity was proposed for use with glacial soils from Iowa.

It discusses performance of different pipe materials (modern flexible pipelines and older brittle pipelines) including effects of pipe diameters, fittings and pipeline components/details, <b>trench</b> <b>backfill</b> characteristics, and severity of liquefaction. Detailed breakdown of key factors contributing to the damage to buried pipes is given with reference to the above and other relevant parameters. Particular attention is given to the interpretation, analysis and modelling of liquefaction effects on the damage and performance of the buried pipe networks. Clear link between liquefaction severity and damage rate for the pipeline has been observed with an increasing damage rate seen with increasing liquefaction severity. The approach taken here was to correlate the pipeline damage to LRI (Liquefaction Resistance Index, newly developed parameter in Cubrinovski et al., 2011) which represents a direct measure for the soil resistance to liquefaction while accounting for the seismic demand through PGA. Key quality of the adopted approach is that it provides a general methodology that in conjunction with conventional methods for liquefaction evaluation can be applied elsewhere in New Zealand and internationally. Preliminary correlations between pipeline damage (breaks km- 1), liquefaction resistance (LRI) and seismic demand (PGA) have been developed for AC pipes, as an example. Such correlations can be directly used in the design and assessment of pipes in seismic areas both in liquefiable and non-liquefiable areas.

40|$|The Home Committee Report, {{published}} in 1985, identified {{the need for}} the reinstatement of service <b>trench</b> <b>backfill</b> to be performed to a higher and more reliable standard. This end was perceived as desirable, not only to improve road quality and safety, but also to increase the protection afforded to utility apparatus, thereby reducing the number of excavations required for its repair and replacement. The replacement of existing method specifications with a performance specification, based on the testing of an appropriate property of the reinstated material, is one possible means of improving the quality of reinstatement works. The Clegg meter is finding increasing usage for the purpose of compaction measurement. This device is simple to use and measures the decceleration response of a mass in collision with the ground surface. The decelartaion response is characterised by the Impact Value. The sampled volume is, however, very small in relation to the volume of material compacted and, for full evaluation, each compacted layer must be individually tested prior to the placing of the subsequent layer. The ideal test would be non-intrusive and operable from the final surface of the granular backfill; wave transmission velocity measurements are thus a potential technique. The propagation of sinusoidally excited Rayleigh-type surface waves is identified as the most promising method of measurement for reinstatement backfill quality. Experimental measurements of particle displacement at depth lend credence to the classical assumption that the depth of propagation of Rayleigh-type surface waves is equal to one-half the wavelength (z = γ/ 2). Included in this thesis is a review of the salient aspects of reinstatement works and a presentation of the necessary theory of wave propagation. The experimental results presented relate to tests on two sand materials compacted using different levels of compactive effort in all above-ground laboratory based trench and also to tests conducted on a crushed limestone aggregate under field conditions. Results from a short programme of field-based case studies are also presented. In addition to the surface wave velocity and Impact Value results, values for dry density and CBR are also presented. The data generally show a good correlation with compactive effort, whether defined simply as the number of passes/layer (N(_p)) or by a new parameter, the ratio of N(_p) to the mean layer thickness (N(_p) /h). Sensitivity analyses indicate that the Impact Value is a more sensitive measure of the degree of compaction than are either the surface wave velocity or the dry density. Conversion of the surface wave velocity results to shear modulus values, using measured density values, gives a sensitivity to compactive effort that is broadly comparable to that of the Impact Value. A novel technique for the analysis of Rayleigh-type surface wave attenuation data is presented. This allows the calculation of the material attenuation coefficient while obviating the need for potentially erroneous estimates as to the state of the attenuation curve, close to the source of vibration, to be made...|$|E

40|$|AbstractRecently trench ducts for allocating {{conveying}} pipes {{for various}} hydraulic or electric lines are tremendously constructed due to {{rapid growth of}} life and communication demand. Graded sands and concrete are usually in conventional excavation and backfill operation. Controlled low-strength material (CLSM) has been proposed as a suitable substitute for this construction. However, exact and reliable analysis is required to assure the stress and settlement limitation. This paper presents static analysis of <b>trench</b> duct <b>backfilled</b> with sustainable materials and conventional materials using boundary element (BE) method. The Young's moduli of CLSM are obtained from laboratory tests for two different binder mixtures, CLSM B- 130 / 30 % and CLSM B- 8 -/ 30 %, respectively. Two-dimensional planar strain is employed in the BE formulation of static analysis and comparison study of 4 kinds of backfill materials, i. e., graded sand, CLSM B 130 - 30 %, CLSM B 130 - 80 %, and concrete. Emphasis is put on the lateral pressure on the side wall, settlement {{at the top of}} trench duct, vertical displacement along the centerline of duct and top of pipe cover, induced by three wheel surcharges: concentrated, strip and uniform lane loads. Convergence tests of BEM results are first conducted. Numerical results show that the settlement and lateral pressure of CLSM backfills are acceptable to assure the applicability of CLSM as a suitable sustainable material employed for trench duct design and backfill construction...|$|R
40|$|The Brecon to Tirley gas {{pipeline}} includes a {{crossing of the}} River Dore, its flood plain and associated shallow gravel aquifer at Vowchurch in Herefordshire. The aquifer {{is used as a}} public supply resource and concern has been raised regarding the likely impact of the pipeline on the aquifer and the integrity of the public supply boreholes. A detailed assessment has been undertaken to identify the likely impact on the water table and hence the integrity of the abstraction borehole performance, which: 1. investigates the hydrogeological impact of the pipeline during construction, and 2. investigates the post-construction long-term effect of trenching and pipe laying. A detailed evaluation of the geological framework, in which the gravel aquifer is a part, showed that the aquifer could receive direct rainfall recharge through the overlying granular till and fine-grained overbank deposits. A conceptual groundwater flow model was created which identified that secondary recharge was taking place from the River Dore in {{the upper part of the}} aquifer with loss back to the river at the lower end of the aquifer. All available data on the aquifer, surface water, meteorological data and land use information were gathered together and used to assess and quantify the recharge processes in the catchment. Numerical modelling of the original pumping test data at Vowchurch yielded formation constants for the aquifer. These data were then incorporated into a numerical groundwater flow model using the object oriented ZOOM suite of modelling software to replicate the available historical data for the aquifer. The best fit model has been used to run a variety of ‘what if’ scenarios. The effect of drawing the water table down with a well point system during construction, to maintain a dry 2 m deep trench, will cause a likely drop in the groundwater head at the Vowchurch pumping station of up to 0. 5 m. This head reduction will be apparent from about one day after the well point system is switched on until the pipe is laid and the <b>trench</b> <b>backfilled</b> some two to three days later. The trench will only need to be dewatered in the 200 m section nearest to and west of the River Dore. Should any turbidity be created in the aquifer by trenching it is likely to be lost as the groundwater travel time from the trench area to the pumping station is at least 100 days. The impact of the completed pipeline on groundwater flow and groundwater heads is minimal. The damming effect of the pipeline on the water table is very small, as is the effect of varying the permeability of the backfill material. Although the relationship with the River Dore will be very slightly modified, that with the Slough Brook remains unchanged as it is perched in the vicinity of the pipeline. The river crossing is through overbank silts and will neither penetrate the till nor the gravel aquifer. It is not expected to impact the aquifer. Trenchless crossings of either the River Dore or the Slough Brook would involve a risk of penetrating the aquifer and, therefore, pose a risk of contaminating it. The trench option for both crossings thus posses the least risk to the aquifer...|$|R
40|$|Arching is an {{important}} phenomenon {{that has to be}} understood when designing <b>backfilled</b> <b>trenches,</b> storage silos and underground mine stopes supporting granular materials.

The objective of this paper is to present three different approaches, namely, analytical, experimental and numerical, to study the vertical normal stresses within a granular material contained between vertical walls. The laboratory model discussed herein is an effective tool in deriving the variation of shear stress on the wall and the average normal stresses with depth. It is shown that the analytical and numerical models that treat the granular material as a continuum suggest an asymptotic vertical normal stress that is reached at certain depths, whereas the laboratory model tests show that the vertical stresses increase continuously even at very large depths...|$|R

These materials have historically been packaged in US Department of Transportation (DOT) approved drums made from low-carbon steel, then handled in one of three ways: (A) Before 1970, the drums were buried in the dry desert soil. It was assumed that chemical and radionuclide mobility would be low and that the isolated, government-owned site would provide sufficient protection for employees and the public. (B) After 1970, the drums containing long-lived transuranic radionuclides were protected from premature failure by stacking them in an ordered array on an asphalt concrete pad in the bottom of a burial trench. The array was then covered with a large, 0. 28 -mm- (011 -in. -) thick polyethylene tarp and the <b>trench</b> was <b>backfilled</b> with 1. 3 m (4 ft) of soil cover. This burial method is referred to as soil-shielded burial. Other configurations were also employed but the soil-shielded burial method contains most of the transuranic drums. (C) Since 1987, US Department of Energy sites have complied with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) regulations. These regulations require mixed waste drums to be stored in RCRA compliant large metal sheds with provisions for monitoring. These sheds are provided with forced ventilation but are not heated or cooled...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the thermal performance of different configurations of trenches using various <b>trench</b> geometries and <b>backfill</b> and insulation materials. A {{limited number of}} laboratory tests were conducted to confirm the thermal properties of the backfills reported in the literature. The frost protection of water service is {{measured in terms of}} the number of days it takes for the frost front to reach the depth of water service lines under sustained subzero surface temperatures. The study specifically included typical granular materials used within the City of Ottawa (formerly the Region of Ottawa [...] Carleton), but the findings can be equally applied to other urban areas in Canada where the surficial terrain is rocky. The thermal analyses of the trenches were conducted using the finite element method that appropriately represents phase changes when the temperature falls below the freezing point of water. The analyses indicate that the use of sandwich insulation is ineffective, and that latent heat of backfill and native soils has a great impact on the frost protection of water service lines. A list of possible trench depths with different backfills and their thermal performance is provided...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis was to {{investigate}} the coal combustion products - CCP- from the brown coal burning thermo-power plant as a component for grouts for <b>backfilling</b> <b>trenches</b> and geo-sounds. The grout is a mixture of inert material, hydraulic binder, additives and water. It must fulfil the criteria of viscosity, volumetric stability, strength and others, for specific usage required properties, like heat permeability. The laboratory tests were performed on different mixtures of fly ash, boiler slag, cement and bentonite. Additionally, a commercial grout was investigated as a reference material. Index properties like the grain size distribution, the Enslin Neff water adsorption test, the Methylene blue test and the Atterberg limit tests were performed on dry row materials. On mixtures with water the volumetric stability and the viscosity were investigated. The compressive strength of hardened grout was measured after 28 days. The investigation shows that the water/dry mass ratio has a great influence to the mixture {{as well as to the}} hardened grout properties. Low addition of bentonite improves the stability of fresh mixture properties and the cement improves the strength of hardened fly ash grout. The boiler slag was found not to be suitable as a part of inert fill, because it is to coarse-grained and should be sieved before its use and it has not hydraulic properties...|$|R
