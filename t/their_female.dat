5|$|Cockatoos {{have a large}} bill, {{which is}} kept sharp by rasping the two mandibles {{together}} when resting. The bill is complemented by a large muscular tongue which helps manipulate seeds inside the bill {{so that they can}} be de-husked before eating. During the de-husking, the lower mandible applies the pressure, the tongue holds the seed in place and the upper mandible acts as an anvil. The eye region of the skull is reinforced to support muscles which move the mandibles sideways. The bills of male cockatoos are generally slightly larger than those of <b>their</b> <b>female</b> counterparts, but this size difference is quite marked in the palm cockatoo.|$|E
5|$|Order of the Amaranth The {{ritual of}} the Order of the Amaranth was {{conceived}} in 1860 to be {{loosely based on}} a society with a similar name instituted over two centuries earlier by Queen Christina of Sweden. Open to master masons and <b>their</b> <b>female</b> relatives, members were once compelled to join the Order of the Eastern Star first, but the two organisations became separate in 1921.|$|E

5|$|The ao dai {{is now a}} {{standard}} for weddings, for celebrating Tết and for other formal occasions. It's the required uniform for female teachers (mostly {{from high school to}} below) and female students in common high schools in the South; there is no requirement for color or pattern for teachers while students use plain white with some small patterns like flowers for school uniform. Companies often require <b>their</b> <b>female</b> staff to wear uniforms that include the ao dai, so flight attendants, receptionists, bank female staff, restaurant staff, and hotel workers in Vietnam may be seen wearing it.|$|E
5|$|The great {{northern}} tilefish has {{a unique}} burrowing behavior and habitat preference. In addition to their unique habitat choice, golden tilefish display sexually dimorphic growth with males growing to larger sizes and are behaviorally dominant over <b>their</b> <b>female</b> counterparts. The {{great northern tilefish}} is not a migratory fish; it stays in one local area that fits its needs all year round. Seasonal migration may occur with changes in the water temperatures around the Nantucket Shoals and Georges Bank during the winter or spring, but this theory has no definitive evidence. A competing theory suggests that tilefish may instead reduce their activity or hibernate within their burrows during times of cold temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Young female tigers {{establish}} their first territories {{close to their}} mother's. The overlap between the female and her mother's territory reduces with time. Males, however, migrate further than <b>their</b> <b>female</b> counterparts and set out {{at a younger age}} to mark out their own area. A young male acquires territory either by seeking out an area devoid of other male tigers, or by living as a transient in another male's territory until he is older and strong enough to challenge the resident male. Young males seeking to establish themselves thereby comprise the highest mortality rate (30–35% per year) amongst adult tigers.|$|E

Subordinate females lick the clitorises of higher-ranked females as a sign of submission and obedience, but females also lick each other's clitorises as a greeting or to strengthen social bonds; in contrast, while all males lick the clitorises of dominant females, the females will not lick the penises of males because males are considered to be of lowest rank.|$|E

5|$|Most slaves {{worked as}} {{plantation}} laborers. Relatively few Brazilians owned slaves and most {{small and medium-sized}} farms employed free workers. Slaves could be found scattered throughout society in other capacities: some were used as house servants, farmers, miners, prostitutes, gardeners and in many other roles. Many emancipated slaves went on to acquire slaves and there were even cases of slaves who had their own slaves. While slaves were usually black or mulatto there were reported cases of slaves {{who appeared to be}} of European descent—the product of generations of inter-ethnic sexual relations between male slave owners and <b>their</b> <b>female</b> mulatto slaves. Even the harshest slave owners adhered to a long-established practice of selling slaves along with their families, taking care not to separate individuals. Slaves were regarded by law as properties. The ones who were freed immediately became citizens with all civil rights guaranteed—the only exception being that, until 1881, freed slaves were barred from voting in elections, although their children and descendants could vote.|$|E
5|$|Opus Dei's highest {{assembled}} {{bodies are}} the General Congresses, {{which are usually}} convened once every eight years. There are separate congresses {{for the men and}} women's branch of Opus Dei. The General Congresses are made up of members appointed by the Prelate, and are responsible for advising him about the prelature's future. The men's General Congress also elects the Prelate from a list of candidates chosen by <b>their</b> <b>female</b> counterparts. After the death of a Prelate, a special elective General Congress is convened. The women nominate their preferred candidates for the prelate and is voted upon by the men to become the next Prelate—an appointment that must be confirmed by the Pope.|$|E
5|$|Quantrill's Raiders had {{a support}} network in Missouri, that {{provided}} them with numerous hiding places. Anderson's sisters aided the guerrillas by gathering information inside Union territory. In August 1863, however, Union General Thomas Ewing, Jr., attempted to thwart the guerrillas by arresting <b>their</b> <b>female</b> relatives, and Anderson's sisters were confined in a three-story building on Grand Avenue in Kansas City {{with a number of}} other girls. While they were confined, the building collapsed, killing one of Anderson's sisters. In the aftermath, rumors that the building had been intentionally sabotaged by Union soldiers spread quickly; Anderson was convinced that it had been a deliberate act. Biographer Larry Wood wrote that Anderson's motivation shifted {{after the death of his}} sister, arguing that killing then became his focus—and an enjoyable act. Castel and Goodrich maintain that killing became more than a means to an end at that point for Anderson: it became an end in itself.|$|E

5|$|There are {{grotesque}} {{figures of}} vetalas (ghosts) on the pilasters of jaga mohan {{and on the}} faces of vimana of the temple. The figures of nagas (snake-man) and <b>their</b> <b>female</b> counterparts nagins and other females show many graceful but chaste poses. Pilgrimage is the theme of many of the scenes on the vimana. The other notable descriptive representation on the vimana is the hunting scene above the central niche on the south side, where stags are depicted running away from a hunter. On the outermost frame around the latticed window of the jaganamohana, delightful scenes of monkeys playing all manners of pranks are depicted. The vimana of the temple is a triratha with a distant semblance of a Pancharatha as evident from the projecting niches flanking the central projection. The bada of the vimana abruptly starts from the talapatna or pavement which consists of three elements instead of the usual five and encloses a parallelepiped instead of the usual cubic sanctum.|$|E
