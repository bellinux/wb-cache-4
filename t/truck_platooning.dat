40|$|Abstract: To meet policy {{requirements}} on increased transport {{energy efficiency and}} reduced emissions, smart control and management of vehicles and fleets have become important {{for the development of}} eco-friendly intelligent transportation systems (ITS). The emergence of new information and communication technologies and their applications, particularly vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, facilitates the implementation of au-tonomous vehicle concepts, and meanwhile serves as an effective means for control of vehicle fleet by continuously providing support and guidance to drivers. While convoy driving of trucks by longitudinal automation could save 5 − 15 % of fuel consumption due to the reduction of air-drag resistance, this study attempts to investigate the energy saving potential of <b>truck</b> <b>platoons</b> by intelligent speed planning. Assuming that real-time traffic information is available because of communication, an efficient speed control algorithm is proposed based on optimal control theory. The method is faster than the conventional dynamic programming approach and hence applied in the study to analyze energy saving potential of simple platoon operations including acceleration and deceleration. The numerical result shows significant improvement on energy saving due to speed planning during platooning. It can be further applied for more complex platooning operations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to the modeling of congested traffic loading events on long span bridges. Conventional traffic load models are based on weigh-in-motion data of non-congested traffic, or something similar to a Poisson Arrival process. In neither case do they account for the mixing between lanes that takes place as traffic becomes congested. It is shown here that cars move out from between trucks as traffic slows down which results in a higher frequency of long <b>platoons</b> of <b>trucks</b> in the slow lane of the bridge. These longer platoons increase some characteristic load effects under the slow lane by a modest but significant amount. Micro-simulation, the process of modeling individual vehicles that is widely used in traffic modeling, is presented here as a means of predicting imposed traffic loading on long-span bridges more accurately. The traffic flow on a congested bridge is modelled using a random mixing process for trucks and cars in each lane, where each vehicle is modelled individually with driver behaviour parameters assigned randomly in a Monte Carlo process. Over a number of simulated kilometres, the vehicles move between lanes in simulated lane-changing manoeuvres. The algorithm was calibrated against video recordings of traffic on a bridge in the Netherlands. Extreme value statistics of measured strains on the bridge are then compared to the corresponding simulation statistics to validate the model. The micro-simulation algorithm shows that the histograms of <b>truck</b> <b>platoon</b> length are moderately affected by lane changing. This in turn is shown to influence some characteristic load effects of the bridge deck...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years {{automotive}} and technology companies have made significant advances in what has been traditionally a completely human function: driving. Crash avoidance features such as lane departure warning and forward collision warning are becoming increasingly more common and cheaper to obtain, even on non-luxury vehicles. Technology companies and auto manufacturers have announced plans to have self-driving vehicles ready for public use as early as 2020. The mass adoption of automated vehicles (AVs) could significantly change surface transportation as we know it today. This thesis is intended to provide a technical analysis of the potential impacts of AVs on current light-duty vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and parking decisions, the economic desirability of widespread deployment of partially automated technologies, and methods for existing roadways to transition to connected and automated vehicle (CAV) transportation, so that policymakers can make more informed decisions during the transition to CAVs. This work takes a look at AVs from a point in time where vehicles are equipped with driver assistance systems (Level 1) to a point in time where AVs are driverless (Level 5) and can self-park. The results of this work indicate that the fleet-wide adoption of partially automated crash avoidance technologies could provide net-benefit of about $ 4 billion at current system effectiveness and could provide an annual net-benefit up to $ 202 billion if all relevant crashes could be prevented. About 25 % of all crashes could be addressed by the crash avoidance technologies examined in this dissertation. Over time, as technologies become more effective and cheaper due to economies of scale, greater benefits than the $ 4 billion could be realized. As automated technologies become more advanced and widespread, existing roadways will {{need to be able to}} accommodate these vehicles. This work investigates the effects of a dedicated <b>truck</b> <b>platoon</b> lane on congestion on the Pennsylvania Turnpike and provides a method for existing roadways and highways to determine viable platoon demonstration sites. The initial results suggest that there are several sections of turnpike that could serve as commercial <b>truck</b> <b>platoon</b> demonstration site while still providing a high LOS to all other vehicles. Once AVs can safely and legally drive unoccupied, vehicles will no longer be limited to their driver’s destination and can search for cheaper parking in more distant parking locations. This work simulates a fleet of privately owned vehicles (POVs) in search of cheaper parking in Seattle, using a rectangular grid throughout the study area. Model results indicate that we are not likely to see significant increase in vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and energy use from cars moving from downtown parking lots to cheaper parking in distance locations but at higher penetration rates, parking lot revenues could likely decline to the point where operating a lot is unsustainable economically, if no parking demand management policies are implemented. Driverless vehicles also promise to increase mobility for those in underserved populations. This work estimates bounds on the potential increases in travel in a fully automated vehicle environment due to an increase in mobility from the non-driving and senior populations and people with travel-restrictive medical conditions. Three demand wedges were established in order to conduct a first-order bounding analysis. The combination of the results from all three demand wedges represents an upper bound of 295 billion miles or a 14 % increase in annual light-duty VMT for the US population 19 and older. AV technology holds much promise in providing a more accessible and safe transportation system. This thesis can help policymakers and stakeholders maximize the benefits and minimize the challenges...|$|R

For example, hilly roads can affect delivery ratio and antennas mounted on opposite sides of a truck can suffer from low delivery ratio at curved roads. In addition, we also found that antennas can sometimes suffer from low delivery ratio even when the trucks are on straight roads, possibly due to reflections from the nearby terrain. Fortunately, the delivery ratio can be greatly improved by using the two side antennas alternately...|$|E
40|$|Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) {{provides}} an intermediate {{step toward a}} longer-term vision of trucks operating in closely-coupled automated platoons. There are important distinctions between CACC and automated <b>truck</b> <b>platooning.</b> First, with CACC, only truck speed control will be automated, using vehicle to vehicle (V 2 V) communication to supplement forward sensors. The drivers will still be responsible for actively steering the vehicle, lane keeping, and monitoring roadway and traffic conditions. Second, while <b>truck</b> <b>platooning</b> systems have relied on a Constant Distance Gap (CDG) control strategy, CACC has relied on a Constant-Time Gap (CTG) control strategy, where the distance between vehicles {{is proportional to the}} speed. For these reasons, a series of trucks using CACC is referred to as a string, rather than a platoon. This report mainly focuses on describing the various CACC operational concept alternatives at the level of individual vehicles, local groups of vehicles and their drivers, and which alternatives should be employed in this research project. These operational concepts can be broken into four categories: string formation, steady-state cruising, string split maneuvers, and faults or abnormal operating conditions...|$|E

30|$|This study implies that, in {{designing}} a <b>truck</b> <b>platooning</b> system, two main factors must be considered, workload and sleepiness. The fully automated truck platoon {{has the advantage}} of being less exhausting for the drivers. The drivers do become sleepier, however, with full than with partial automation, though they also become sleepier with partial automation than in the baseline condition, so sleepiness is something that must be considered for all levels of automation. The disadvantage of fully automated <b>truck</b> <b>platooning</b> is that it is more technically advanced and also has legal consequences. Gasser and Westhoff [8] identified five levels of automation, with partial automation, in which the driver must continuously monitor the system and be prepared to take over control at any time, being possible under current legislation. That does not necessarily exclude both lateral and longitudinal automation, but one can argue that driver preparedness to take over control at any time will be considerably compromised if the driving task is fully automated. In a similar study in the MODAS project, Krupenia et al. [13] found that, compared with a no-HMI condition, the full-HMI condition supported higher trust and a lower workload. These findings, along with those of the present study, together identify a need for well-designed HMIs in automated driving. Just adding automation that relieves the driver of some driving tasks without a well-designed HMI that keeps the driver an equal member of the driver–vehicle unit will likely lead to higher workload, more sleepiness, and lower trust.|$|E
30|$|Workload {{was higher}} for partial than for full {{automation}} or the baseline condition. Trust and acceptance were generally {{highest in the}} baseline condition, and did not differ between partial and full automation. Drivers may {{believe that they have}} more situation awareness during automated driving than they actually do. Both levels of automation led to a higher degree of sleepiness than in the baseline condition. The challenge when implementing <b>truck</b> <b>platooning</b> is to develop a system, including human–machine interaction (HMI), that does not overburden the driver, properly addresses driver sleepiness, and satisfies current legislation. The system also must be trusted and accepted by drivers. To achieve this, the development of well-designed HMI will be crucial.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Platooning {{is a way}} to {{significantly}} reduce fuel consumption of trucks. Vehicles that drive at close inter-vehicle distance assisted by automatic controllers experience substantially lower air-drag. In this paper, we deal with the problem of coordinating the formation and the breakup of platoons in a fuel-optimal way. We formulate an optimization problem which accounts for routing, speed-dependent fuel consumption, and platooning decisions. An algorithm to obtain an approximate solution to the problem is presented. It first determines the shortest path for each <b>truck.</b> Then, possible <b>platoon</b> configurations are identified. For a certain platoon configuration the optimal speed profile is the solution to a convex program. The algorithm is illustrated by a realistic example. I...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} {{significant}} improvements {{in recent years in}} transportation and emissions modeling, in order to better evaluate transportation operational effects and associated vehicle emissions. In particular, instantaneous or modal emissions models have been developed for a variety of light-duty vehicles. To date, most effort has focused primarily on developing these models for light-duty vehicles with less effort devoted to Heavy-Duty Diesel (HDD) vehicles. Although HDD vehicles currently make up {{only a fraction of the}} total vehicle population, they are major contributors to the emissions inventory. Furthermore, it is generally believed that transit buses and heavy trucks will offer earlier opportunities for public implementation of automated operations compared to passenger cars. Thus, there is a critical need to have robust modal emissions and fuel consumption models for HDD vehicles. This report describes a HDD truck model that is now part of a larger Comprehensive Modal Emissions Modeling (CMEM) program developed at the University of California, Riverside. Within the CMEM framework, several HDD truck fuel consumption and emission sub-models have been developed, each corresponding to a distinctive vehicle/technology category. The developed models use a parameterized physical approach where the entire emission process is broken down into different components that correspond to physical phenomena associated with vehicle operation and emission production. As part of a parallel research program, UC Riverside has developed a Mobile Emissions Research Laboratory (MERL) that can be attached to a number of heavy duty rigs to measure instantaneous (i. e., modal) emissions and fuel consumption in-situ. Using MERL, a variety of trucks were extensively tested under a wide range of operating conditions. The collected data (along with other HDD truck data sources) were then used to calibrate the HDD models. Particular care was taken to investigate and implement the effects of varying grade and the effects of variable ignition timing. In this report, background material is provide on HDD vehicle fuel consumption and emissions research, followed by a description of the vehicle testing program. The HDD vehicle model development process is then described, along with the model validation process. The model was subsequently integrated with a variety of transportation simulation modeling tools for the purposes of evaluating several automation scenarios. Particular emphasis has been placed on simulating the <b>truck</b> <b>platoon</b> scenario, where aerodynamic drafting effects can provide a significant benefit in terms of fuel and emissions savings. In addition to the modeling, experimentation has been carried out with MERL in real-world tests, examining trucks traveling in tandem with close inter-vehicle spacings. Results of these tests are also described herein. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with fuel-efficient driving strategies for heavy-duty vehicles driving on highways with varying topography. A method for reducing the fuel consumption of single <b>trucks</b> and <b>platoons</b> consisting of several trucks is described and evaluated both in simulation and in real trucks. The method, referred to as speed profile optimization (SPO), uses a genetic algorithm to find fuel-efficient speed profiles. Using SPO, the fuel consumption of a single truck was reduced by 11. 5 % (on average) relative to standard cruise control. The method’s extension to platooning (P-SPO), reduced the fuel consumption by 15. 8 % to 17. 4 % for homogeneous and heterogeneous platoons (with different mass configurations), respectively, relative to the combination of cruise control and adaptive cruise control, when applied to road profiles of 10 km length. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the results obtained in the simulations are sufficiently accurate {{to be transferred to}} real trucks. The SPO and P-SPO methods also outperform the commonly used MPC- based methods by a few percentage points: For single trucks, SPO outper- formed an MPC-based approach by 3 percentage points, in a case with iden- tical roads and similar experimental settings. Similarly, for a <b>platoon</b> of two <b>trucks,</b> P-SPO outperformed an MPC-based approach by around 3 percent- age points...|$|R
