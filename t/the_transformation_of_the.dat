5|$|Although {{absolute}} {{in theory}} and in principle, the sultan's powers were limited in practice. Political decisions had {{to take into account}} the opinions and attitudes of important members of the dynasty, the bureaucratic and military establishments, as well as religious leaders. Beginning in the last decades of the sixteenth century, the role of the Ottoman sultans in the government of the empire began to decrease, in a period known as <b>the</b> <b>Transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Empire. Despite being barred from inheriting the throne, women of the Imperial Harem—especially the reigning sultan's mother, known as the Valide Sultan—also played an important behind-the-scenes political role, effectively ruling the empire during the period known as the Sultanate of Women.|$|E

5|$|From {{the early}} 1950s through the 1960s, Syracuse University added {{programs}} and staff that continued <b>the</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> school into a research university.

The School of Social Work, which eventually merged into the College of Human Ecology, was founded in 1956. Syracuse's College of Engineering also founded the nation's second oldest computer engineering and bioengineering programs. In 1962, Samuel Irving Newhouse, Sr. donated $15million to begin construction of a school of communications, eventually known as the SI Newhouse School of Public Communications.

5|$|From {{the late}} eighteenth century Scotland gained many of the organisations {{associated}} with the revival in England, including Sunday schools, mission schools, ragged schools, Bible societies and improvement classes.

5|$|Swarming {{behaviour}} is {{a response}} to overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase in levels of serotonin. This causes the locust to change colour, eat much more, and breed much more easily. <b>The</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> locust to the swarming form is induced by several contacts per minute over a four-hour period. A large swarm can consist of billions of locusts spread out over an area of thousands of square kilometres, with a population of up to 80 million individuals per square kilometre (200 million per square mile). When desert locusts meet, their nervous systems release serotonin, which causes them to become mutually attracted, a prerequisite for swarming.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, three {{methods for}} {{describing}} <b>the</b> conformal <b>transformations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> S-matrix in {{quantum field theory}} are proposed. They are illustrated by applying the algebraic renormalization procedure to the quantum scalar field theory, defined by the LSZ reduction mechanism in the BPHZ renormalization scheme. Central results are shown to be independent of scheme choices and derived to all orders in loop expansions. Firstly, the local Callan-Symanzik equation is constructed, in which <b>the</b> insertion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> energy-momentum tensor {{is related to the}} beta function and the anomalous dimension. With this result, the Ward identities for <b>the</b> conformal <b>transformations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Green functions are derived. Then <b>the</b> conformal <b>transformations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> S-matrix defined by the LSZ reduction procedure are calculated. Secondly, <b>the</b> conformal <b>transformations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> S-matrix in the functional formalism are related to charge constructions. The commutators between the charges and the S-matrix operator are in a compact way to represent <b>the</b> conformal <b>transformations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> S-matrix. Lastly, the massive scalar field theory with local coupling is introduced in order to control breaking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conformal invariance further. <b>The</b> conformal <b>transformations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> S-matrix with local coupling are calculated...|$|R
