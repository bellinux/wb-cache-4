25|$|In the 2016 general election, Salem County voters {{approved}} a binding referendum {{to cut the}} number of freeholders from seven to five as well as a non-binding referendum to cut freeholder salaries by 20%; both initiatives, which had been placed on the ballot as the result of grassroots campaigns opposed to a proposed outsourcing deal, passed by a 3-1 margin. In the wake of the referendum results, Freeholder Director Julie Acton resigned in December 2016 and was replaced by Scott Griscom. In April 2017, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the reduction in seats will be accomplished through attrition, with the seats expiring at the end of 2017 (held by freeholders Cross, Painter and Vanderslice) being eliminated; in the November 2017 general election <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> new three-year seat up for vote as well as a two-year unexpired term, so that on January 1, 2018, there will be a five-member freeholder board.|$|E

2500|$|According to Islamic {{tradition}} {{which describes}} this graphically, Jesus' descent {{will be in}} the midst of wars fought by al-Mahdi (lit. [...] "the rightly guided one"), known in Islamic eschatology as the redeemer of Islam, against al-Masīh ad-Dajjāl (the Antichrist [...] "false messiah") and his followers. Jesus will descend at the point of a white arcade, east of Damascus, dressed in yellow robes—his head anointed. He will say prayer behind al-Mahdi then join him in his war against the Dajjal. Jesus, considered as a Muslim, will abide by the Islamic teachings. Eventually, Jesus will slay the Antichrist, and then everyone {{who is one of the}} People of the Book (ahl al-kitāb, referring to Jews and Christians) will believe in him. Thus, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> community, that of Islam.|$|E

Your whole life, like a sandglass, will always be reversed and will ever run out again, - a long minute of time will elapse until all those conditions out of which you were evolved return in the wheel of the cosmic process. And then you will find every pain and every pleasure, every friend and every enemy, every hope and every error, every blade of grass and every ray of sunshine once more, and the whole fabric of things which make up your life. This ring in which you are but a grain will glitter afresh forever. And in every one of these cycles of human life <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> hour where, for the first time one man, and then many, will perceive the mighty thought of the eternal recurrence of all things:- and for mankind this is always the hour of Noon".|$|E
2500|$|After Titanic sank, Jones {{suggested}} {{going back}} to save some {{of those in the}} water. Only three passengers agreed; the rest refused, fearing that the boat would be capsized by desperate swimmers. Jones acquiesced, but told them: [...] "Ladies, if any of us are saved, remember I wanted to go back. I would rather drown with them than leave them." [...] The passengers' conduct during the subsequent hours presented some striking contrasts. Lady Rothes– who {{had been one of the}} few passengers to support a rescue attempt– took charge of the tiller and put others to work at the oars. Her conduct was later complimented by Jones, who called her [...] "more of a man than any we had aboard" [...] and gave her the lifeboat's numeral 8, in a frame, as a keepsake. In fact, when Walter Lord, author of A Night to Remember, interviewed the Countess and Seaman Jones in 1954, he discovered their mutual admiration had led to a lifelong correspondence. By contrast, Ella White was so annoyed that the stewards in lifeboat number 8 were smoking cigarettes that she complained about it at the US Senate inquiry into the disaster; she was particularly indignant that one of the ship's crewmen had said to another during the night: [...] "If you don't stop talking through that hole in your face, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> less in the boat!" ...|$|E
