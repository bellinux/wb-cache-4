5|$|Commercially, apples can {{be stored}} for some months in {{controlled}} atmosphere chambers to delay ethylene-induced ripening. Apples are commonly stored in chambers with higher concentrations {{of carbon dioxide and}} high air filtration. This prevents ethylene concentrations from rising to higher amounts and preventing ripening from occurring <b>too</b> <b>quickly.</b> Ripening continues when the fruit is removed from storage.|$|E
5|$|Low, {{using his}} newly {{captured}} ship, lay in {{wait on the}} popular shipping route between Boston and New York. Within a few days, he and his crew seized a sloop out of Rhode Island and plundered it. His crew cut the rigging away to prevent the sloop returning <b>too</b> <b>quickly</b> to port to raise the alarm. He then captured a number of unarmed merchantmen near Port Rosemary.|$|E
5|$|This made reactor {{plutonium}} {{unsuitable for}} use in a gun-type weapon. The plutonium-240 would start the chain reaction <b>too</b> <b>quickly,</b> causing a predetonation that would release enough energy to disperse the critical mass with a minimal amount of plutonium reacted (a fizzle). A faster gun was suggested but found to be impractical. The possibility of separating the isotopes was considered and rejected, as plutonium-240 is even harder to separate from plutonium-239 than uranium-235 from uranium-238.|$|E
60|$|But now he heard, outside, {{the sounds}} of many voices, and long mournful howls, and mighty wailing. He was startled. Had he {{remained}} <b>too</b> long? <b>Quickly</b> he reached the doorway and peered down the village street toward the village gate.|$|R
60|$|We three {{went out}} of the prison and walked up and down at some short {{distance}} from the gate, which was in a retired place. We had not waited long when Mr. and Mrs. Bagnet came out <b>too</b> and <b>quickly</b> joined us.|$|R
50|$|Gui√©-Mien {{was then}} {{approached}} by Bundesliga side Eintracht Frankfurt {{and agreed to}} join them {{before the start of}} 1999-2000. Here <b>too</b> he <b>quickly</b> became central to the team's plans, but again, after survival in his first year, the club dropped into the second division the following season.|$|R
5|$|A {{railroad}} link to Aspen {{was therefore}} {{likely to be}} highly profitable, and two railroads, the Colorado Midland and the Denver & Rio Grande Western, hoped to be the first. In the early 1880s, however, neither seemed able to do so. The Midland was a paper railroad with no money to build anything. The Rio Grande was building, but <b>too</b> <b>quickly,</b> forcing it into receivership. Financially cautious from its recent troubles, it chose not to build to Aspen despite its president's enthusiasm for the project.|$|E
5|$|Analysis is the {{activity}} of breaking an observation or theory down into simpler concepts {{in order to understand}} it. Reductionism can refer to one of several philosophical positions related to this approach. One type of reductionism is the belief that all fields of study are ultimately amenable to scientific explanation. Perhaps a historical event might be explained in sociological and psychological terms, which in turn might be described in terms of human physiology, which in turn might be described in terms of chemistry and physics. Daniel Dennett distinguishes legitimate reductionism from what he calls greedy reductionism, which denies real complexities and leaps <b>too</b> <b>quickly</b> to sweeping generalizations.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of her American-Hawaiian career, American sailed in {{scheduled}} service from New York and Philadelphia around South America via the Straits of Magellan, up to San Francisco {{and from there to}} Honolulu. Along the way, she was refueled with coal at Saint Lucia in the British West Indies and at Coronel in Chile. The Chilean coal was often of lesser quality which burned <b>too</b> <b>quickly</b> and dangerously sent sparks flying from the ship's funnel; the quality and fire danger were key reasons that all subsequent American-Hawaiian ships used oil instead of coal for fuel.|$|E
50|$|At {{about the}} same time, Andrew Janowicz {{developed}} a useful version of cobalt catalyzed chain transfer for controlling the molecular weight of free radicalpolymerizations. The technology has been further developed by Alexei Gridnev and Steven Ittel. It, <b>too,</b> was <b>quickly</b> commercialized and a fundamental understanding of the process developed {{over a longer period}} of time.|$|R
60|$|It is surprising, <b>too,</b> how <b>quickly</b> {{the moon}} {{can go out}} on the stage. At one moment it is riding in full {{radiance}} {{in the midst of a}} cloudless sky, and the next instant it is gone! Just as though it had been turned off at a meter. It makes you quite giddy at first until you get used to it.|$|R

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the third Four Quartets poem, The Dry Salvages, Eliot's health declined and he stayed in Shamley Green, Surrey while he recovered. During this time, Eliot started writing Little Gidding. The first draft was completed in July 1941 but he was dissatisfied with it. He believed the problems with the poem lay with his own inability to write, and that, precipitated by air raids on London, he had started the poem with too little preparation and had written it <b>too</b> <b>quickly.</b> After the first draft was written, he set the poem aside, and he left in September to lecture throughout Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|French and Wabanaki Confederacy raiding {{activity}} {{continued in}} northern Massachusetts in 1705, {{against which the}} English colonists were unable to mount an effective defense. The raids happened <b>too</b> <b>quickly</b> for defensive forces to organize, and reprisal raids usually found tribal camps and settlements empty. There was a lull in the raiding while the French and English leaders negotiated the exchange of prisoners, with only limited success. Raids by Indians persisted {{until the end of}} the war, sometimes with French participation.|$|E
5|$|In 1545, from Southsea Castle, he {{witnessed}} his flagship Mary Rose sink {{with the loss}} of about 500 lives, whilst going into action against the French fleet in the Battle of the Solent. Some historians believe that the Mary Rose turned <b>too</b> <b>quickly</b> and submerged her open gun ports, whereas others argue that it sank due to its poor design. Over the years, Portsmouth's fortifications were rebuilt and improved by successive monarchs. In 1563, Portsmouth suffered from an outbreak of a plague, resulting in about 300 deaths out of the town's population of 2000.|$|E
60|$|Here comes I, the Turkish knight Just {{come from}} Turkey land to fight; I'll fight thee, St. George, St. George, thou man of courage bold, If thy blood be <b>too</b> hot, I'll <b>quickly</b> make it cold.|$|R

50|$|Son of a Protestant clergyman in Geneva in the Republic of Geneva, he {{was born}} in that city, and was educated for a {{clerical}} career. However, he abandoned it for law, and this <b>too</b> he <b>quickly</b> deserted to devote himself to education and to travelling. He became close friends with Jean Jacques Rousseau, and, a little later, with Dugald Stewart, having previously distinguished himself as a translator of and commentator on Euripides.|$|R
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to regain her {{position}} in the national squad, Kydd attended the extended squad's first training camp in September 2005, but {{was one of several}} players forced out after succumbing to a virus. She was subsequently left out of the team for a practice tour of Jamaica and New Zealand in the lead-up to the 2006 Commonwealth Games, but continued her efforts to make the team for the Games. Finally, on 10 December 2005, she voluntarily withdrew her name from selection, noting ongoing complications from the earlier concussion (team doctors stated that she had probably attempted to return <b>too</b> <b>quickly)</b> and low motivation.|$|E
5|$|The game {{contains}} {{three types}} of clouds: white clouds, which follow the avatar; gray, neutral clouds, which become white when touched; and black clouds, which may be combined with white clouds to cause rain, dissolving both clouds. A large number of white clouds more easily dissolves {{a small number of}} dark clouds than an equal number, and vice versa. White clouds stop following the avatar if the player moves <b>too</b> <b>quickly</b> and they resume following if approached again. Each of the four missions in Cloud has a different objective, including forming patterns in the sky with clouds, eliminating black clouds, and creating rain over each of the islands.|$|E
5|$|The natural {{untreated}} water is generally devoid of all minerals, bacteria, and suspended matter, approaching {{the purity of}} distilled water. In 1987 Malvern gained official EU status as a natural mineral water, a mark of purity and quality. However, in spite of regular quality analysis, drought in 2006 dried out the rock that filters the water, allowing the water to flow through it <b>too</b> <b>quickly</b> for the natural filtering process. Due to the slight impurities, the Coca-Cola Company, manufacturer of the Schweppes brand, had to install filtration equipment, which reclassifies the water as spring water under EU law.|$|E
50|$|The brick {{courthouse}} {{had survived}} the fire of 1879; but soon thereafter, it proved too small to handle the county's increasing business and store its growing records. In 1882, the county began renting the top two floors of the newly constructed Opera House, and moved its offices there; but this <b>too</b> was <b>quickly</b> outgrown. In 1889, a $60,000 bond issue {{for the construction of}} a new courthouse passed; the new Romanesque Revival building was completed in 1892.|$|R
50|$|Tuesday, April 7, 2010 - (Game 2 @ Rouen) Angers took a 2-0 {{lead in the}} 2nd Period of the game. Rouen {{started the}} 3rd Period with a quick goal to bring them within one. Angers quickly responded and scored again, putting {{themselves}} up 3-1. And desperation set in for Rouen as they <b>too</b> responded <b>quickly</b> scoring, making it 3-2 Angers. Angers responded several minutes later making it 4-2. Angers never looked back from there. 4-2 final score.|$|R
50|$|It {{is argued}} that Bronislava Nijinska's brother Vaslav Nijinsky had the {{greatest}} influence on her. In Nijinska‚Äôs memoir, she speaks of the overwhelming curiosity Vaslav possessed from a young age. His low performance in school is recorded; Nijinska attributes this to his disinterest and impatience. He instead wanted to explore the world and test his physical limits. He became an incredible dancer. At Mariinsky Theater and at Ballets Russes, <b>too,</b> Vaslav <b>quickly</b> rose. Soon Vaslav was performing as principal dancer.|$|R
5|$|Throughout {{the world}} {{are a variety of}} enemies, {{including}} standard fantasy monsters such as imps and goblins, and animals such as bears and wolves. Enemies become stronger and weapons and armor more effective as the player levels up. This game mechanic of level-scaling was incorporated to maintain a constant and moderate aspect of difficulty. However, level-scaling combined with the leveling system has received criticism, as {{it has the potential to}} unbalance the game; characters with major skills that increase on an involuntary basis, such as athletics or armor, can find that they level <b>too</b> <b>quickly,</b> making the enemies proportionately harder than intended.|$|E
5|$|As Eliot was {{finishing}} his second poem, World War II began to disrupt {{his life and}} he spent more time lecturing across Great Britain and helping out during the war when he could. It was during this time that Eliot began working on The Dry Salvages, the third poem, which was put together {{near the end of}} 1940. This poem was published in February 1941 and Eliot immediately began to plot out his fourth poem, Little Gidding. Eliot's health declined and he stayed in Shamley Green to recuperate. His illness and the war disrupted his ability to write and he became dissatisfied with each draft. He believed that the problem with the poem was with himself and that he had started the poem too soon and written it <b>too</b> <b>quickly.</b> By September 1941, he stopped writing and focused on his lecturing. It was not until September 1942 that Eliot finished the last poem and it was finally published.|$|E
5|$|In Vancouver, the {{organization}} Save the Grizzlies {{was established to}} find a local investor to purchase the team. Led by among others Peter Ufford, they had a plan to create a public entity which could take over ownership of the team. Ufford retrospectively stated that had the attempt been given more time, {{they may have been}} able to secure a deal to keep the team in town, but that the relocation decision came <b>too</b> <b>quickly</b> for any plan to be finalized. Heisley stated that he had been willing to sell the team with a 30% discount to a Vancouver investor if he could secure a guarantee that the team would remain in town.|$|E

50|$|David marries the {{beautiful}} but na√Øve Dora Spenlow, but their marriage proves unhappy for David. Dora dies {{early in their}} marriage. After Dora's death, Agnes encourages David to return to normal life and his profession of writing. While living in Switzerland, David realises that he loves Agnes. Upon returning to England, after a failed attempt to conceal his feelings, David finds that Agnes loves him <b>too.</b> They <b>quickly</b> marry and in this marriage, he finds true happiness. David and Agnes then have at least five children, including a daughter named after his great-aunt, Betsey Trotwood.|$|R
5|$|John McFall {{was born}} on 25 April 1981 in Frimley, Surrey, in England. Between 1994 and 1997 he {{attended}} school at Millfield in Street, Somerset, where as a teenager he was a runner and hockey player. In August 2000 while on a gap-year trip to Ko Samui, Thailand, after his A-levels, {{he was involved in}} a serious motorcycle accident. While riding a moped, he went round a corner <b>too</b> <b>quickly</b> and skidded. He put out his leg to stop the motorcycle from falling over, and smashed his knee. The motorcycle then fell on him, resulting in the chain severing major blood vessels in his leg. He was flown to a hospital in Bangkok, but as he had damaged his lower right leg too severely, it had to be amputated above the knee after three days. Upon returning to the UK, he spent about seven weeks undergoing rehabilitation at Queen Mary's Hospital in Roehampton, London.|$|E
5|$|Mass√©na {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire {{shipyard}} in September 1892 and launched nearly three years later in July 1895. She was completed in June 1898, {{in time for the}} Northern Squadron maneuvers conducted in July 1898. She was assigned as the flagship of the Northern Squadron, and flew the flag of Vice Admiral M√©nard. The Northern Squadron conducted annual training exercises in June; the following month, they joined the Mediterranean Squadron for combined fleet maneuvers. In 1900, four engineering officers were seriously injured while disassembling a pipe to repair it. They had disassembled it <b>too</b> <b>quickly,</b> and were severely scalded by escaping steam. In 1903, the ship was transferred from the Northern Squadron to the Mediterranean, where she was assigned to the 2nd Squadron along with several of her half-sister ships.|$|E
5|$|Minister of Local Government and Regional Development, Gunnar Berge, {{stated in}} January 1995 {{that he was}} {{concerned}} that the post-Olympic use funds were being used up <b>too</b> <b>quickly</b> and that money was being used for unsuitable projects. However, he rejected that the state should take control over the venues or the money. After one year, Lillehammer Olympiapark had used NOK32 of 146 million, while the company Olympia Utvikling/Troll Park had used NOK14 of 95 million. For the Lillehammer companies, {{this meant that the}} fund was estimated to run out after ten instead of twenty years. In contrast, Hamar Olympiske Anlegg had only used the fund's yield. LOOC criticized the post-Olympic use companies, stating that they were too bureaucratic, that their combined 100 employees were too many, and that one or two companies would be sufficient.|$|E

60|$|I was on {{the point}} of telling her everything, and {{dragging}} her back to her post of duty which she should never have relinquished. Fortunately my sense of what I owed to my own professional dignity prevented my taking such a step. It was clearly not for me to argue. My first duty was to stand by this helpless woman in distress, who had been committed to my charge, and to convey her safely to St. Claude. After which I could see to it that Mademoiselle Ang√®le was brought along <b>too</b> as <b>quickly</b> as influential relatives could contrive.|$|R
