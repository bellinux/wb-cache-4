40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{indications}} {{and distribution of}} cases chosen for <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy and reasons delaying until third trimester termination. Methods: Retrospective study of cases between 2002 and 2006 in the hospital council. Cases were divided in two groups, as early termination (< 23 weeks of gestation) and late termination (≥ 23 weeks of gestation). All pregnant women who underwent termination were classified according to related systemic pathology and chorionicity. Reasons for delaying until third trimester termination were evaluated in four groups. Results: During this five year period 1. 449 complicated pregnancies were counseled and in 713 cases <b>termination</b> was <b>offered.</b> <b>Of</b> 677 cases (94. 95 %) with termination, 412 cases (60. 09 %) had early and 265 cases (39. 91 %) late termination. The most frequent indications were central nervous system abnormalities (51. 7 %), chromosomal abnormalities (11. 7 %), and urogenital abnormalities (8. 4 %). The main reason for delaying <b>termination</b> was failure <b>of</b> screening by ultrasound (65. 6 %).

Methods: We have analyzed <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy in our clinic {{through the last}} 11 years, both the numbers and the methods. In addition, a questionnaire related to abortion methods was sent to the head of all gynecologic departments in Norway. Results: The number of surgical abortions has been halved through the last 11 years in our clinic, and medical abortion at home is now the main method and accounts for 48 % <b>of</b> all <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy.

40|$|Abstract. Innermost {{context-sensitive}} rewriting {{has been}} proved useful for modeling computations of programs of algebraic languages like Maude, OBJ, etc. Furthermore, innermost <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> rewriting is often easier to prove than termination. Thus, under appropriate conditions, a useful strategy for proving <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> rewriting is trying to prove <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> innermost rewriting. This phenomenon has also been investigated for context-sensitive rewriting (CSR). Up to now, only few transformations have been proposed and used to prove <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> innermost CSR. In this paper, we investigate direct methods for proving <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> innermost CSR.
