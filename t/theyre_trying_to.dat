To begin with, the setting and texture are much different than that of most mainstream romances. The culture, in which post-college African Americans mingle while pursuing careers and relationships, represents a significant change from what were used to. The Sanctuary, the intimate Chicago nightclub where Darius and Nina meet, is rich in its eclectic, bluesy atmosphere. And Love Joness dialogue is rarely trite.

[...] He continued, [...] "Is The Lover any good as a serious film? Not really. Annaud and his collaborators have got all of the physical details just right, but there is a failure of the imagination here; we do not sense the presence of real people behind the attractive facades of the two main actors."Desson Howe of the Washington Post observed, [...] "Director Jean-Jacques Annaud and adapter Gerard Brach provide more than a few effective moments [...] [...] [...] But the story is dramatically not that interesting. After establishing the affair and its immediate problems, Lover never quite rises to the occasion. Scratch away the steamy, evocative surface, remove Jeanne Moreaus veteran-voiced narration, and you have only art-film banalities."Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly graded the film C, calling it [...] "one more movie that titillates us with the prospect of taking sex seriously and then dampens our interest by taking it too seriously. Why do so many filmmakers insist on staging erotic encounters as if they were some sort of hushed religious ritual? The answer, of course, is that <b>theyre</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> dignify sex. But sex isnt dignified — its messy and playful and abandoned. In The Lover, director Jean-Jacques Annaud gives us the sweating and writhing without the spontaneity and surprise." ...|$|E
