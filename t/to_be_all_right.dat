25|$|On April 23, 2012, Bagwell {{was seriously}} {{injured in a}} car accident. According to the Woodstock police report, Bagwell called his wife at 1:35 PM {{to tell her that}} he was about to suffer a seizure while driving. He was {{subsequently}} taken to WellStar Kennestone Hospital in his hometown of Marietta, Georgia, where he was placed in the hospital's intensive care unit after suffering broken bones in his neck, face and jaw. On April 24, fellow WCW alumnus and former tag team partner Scott Norton released a statement via Twitter to confirm that Bagwell was going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> On April 25, Universal Championship Wrestling performer and Bagwell's brother John released a statement to confirm that Bagwell's condition was improving, but that he still required breathing and feeding tubes and would undergo surgery once the swelling in his face and neck subsided. On April 28, Bagwell's mother Judy revealed to TMZ that he had been taken off the breathing tube, was able to eat solid foods, and was able to talk. Fellow WCW alumni Sting, the Steiner Brothers, and Diamond Dallas Page have also kept in contact with Bagwell since his crash. On May 3, Universal Championship Wrestling announced via Twitter that Bagwell was able to walk again, but still had a tingling sensation in his arms and hands. UCW also stated that he had four plates surgically inserted in his face and that his jaw was wired shut after surgery.|$|E
500|$|On 9 January 2015, Annie Mac played [...] "Living for Love" [...] on Radio 1 {{during her}} evening dance show. In a later {{interview}} with The Independent, Mac {{said that her}} mission was to [...] "represent the landscape of new music honestly", and hoped that older artists such as Madonna should not get excluded from the station. [...] "I'm a lifelong Madonna fan and I played her on my Friday show. [...] If I'm excited by a song, then I think it's going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> to play it", Mac concluded.|$|E
500|$|Russell {{was driven}} by [...] "a {{neurotic}} need to win", as his Celtic teammate Heinsohn observed. He was so tense before every game that he regularly threw up in the locker rooms; {{early in his career}} it happened so frequently that his fellow Celtics were more worried when it did not happen. Later in Russell's career, Havlicek said of his teammate and coach that he threw up less often than early in his career, only doing so [...] "when it's an important game or an important challenge for himâ€”someone like Chamberlain, or someone coming up that everyone's touting. [...] is a welcome sound, too, because it means he's keyed up for the game, and around the locker room we grin and say, [...] "Man, we're going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> tonight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! nonsense, my dear; {{of course}} you'll go; it's {{the show of}} the year, and the Grand duke <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> there--baby <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> now, you know; I must not hear of your not going.' ...|$|R
60|$|JENNY [supporting him] Come! pluck up. I'll get you {{something}} <b>to</b> eat. You'll <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> then.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks." [...] She smiled. [...] "You seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> doing <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> too. Commander Gross {{tells me}} that you're {{responsible}} for this project, Operation Head, as they call it. Whose head have you decided on?" ...|$|R
2500|$|According to his {{statements}} to police, Goetz checked {{the first two}} men {{to make sure that}} they had been [...] "taken care of," [...] then, seeing that the fourth man was now sitting down and seemed unhurt, said, [...] "You seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> here's another," [...] and fired at him again. [...] That the fourth man, Cabey, was shot only once was a fact not made known to Goetz or his attorneys until shortly before the trial. One bullet missed, fragmenting on the steel cab wall behind Cabey. (The missed shot would also be the basis of a charge of reckless endangerment of other passengers.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Survival on Charter #220: [...] While Squad 51 is on a call, {{two planes}} collide with one landing in a Los Angeles subdivision, {{trapping}} Gage and DeSoto. A {{resident of the}} subdivision which {{was the site of}} the crash was the girlfriend of one of Squad 51's other paramedics from another shift. The on and off-duty firefighters make multiple rescues and the injured girl Squad 51 was originally dispatched to help turns out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> During the rescue, however, an engine from one of the planes lands on the squad, rendering it out of commission due to the heavy damage it sustained.|$|E
2500|$|... {{imagine a}} puddle waking {{up one morning}} and thinking, 'This is an {{interesting}} world I find myself in, an interesting hole I find myself in, fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact, it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!' This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it's still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> because this World was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for.|$|E
2500|$|Allen joined Commonwealth's {{board of}} {{directors}} about two months after leaving the governor's office in January 1998. [...] "I learned a lot on their board and enjoyed working with 'em, and they seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> doing <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> I guess," [...] Allen said in October 2006.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wasn't going to," [...] said Jimmy. [...] "I <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> say it'll <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> {{after the}} night. People will soon forget how badly the thing went." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I must go. I have my work <b>to</b> do. You <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> now. I {{think that}} with your nervous system you should take up some less morbid study." ...|$|R
2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} arrival of her house guests, Joan had learned that her husband was still {{maintaining}} his small apartment and still involved with Ann Kurth. On the day following the argument, Hill took his son for a haircut, and during the drive, they went to his apartment to pick up some things; the boy talked with his mother about it when he arrived home. Joan invited her friend and neighbor Vann Maxwell over to discuss the matter, and when she arrived, announced an impromptu game of bridge with Settegast and Woolen in the music room. John Hill was listening to music {{at one end of the}} room while the women played cards at the other. Joan began loudly discussing her husband, then slipping into silence whenever he approached. She told the women that she was planning to consult a lawyer on Monday, and Maxwell became uneasy with the situation. She asked Joan to be quiet or she would leave. Joan then started writing notes to her friend, in which she repeated her intention to speak to a lawyer, and to take John out of her will. After a tense evening, Hill put on a romantic record and came over to stand behind his wife's chair. Settegast suggested the couple should dance, and they did. Afterwards they retired to bed. The next morning, Joan told Settegast that Hill had made her [...] "very happy" [...] the previous night. [...] "He told me things I've never heard from the man before in our whole married life. I think it's going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> between us from now on." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{felt her}} cool {{hand on his}} forehead, smelled violets, and sat divided between a sort of {{pleasure}} and a determination <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> at present," [...] {{said the}} mate, who was tenderly sucking his forefinger; [...] "best of spirits, I should say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Grant's got one o' his fits on," [...] {{said the}} young wife, {{speaking}} for the first time. [...] "Don't pay any attention <b>to</b> him. He'll <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> in the morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No you don't," [...] he cried. [...] "We {{all start}} at six. What time do you-all want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> called? Five? <b>All</b> <b>right,</b> I'll rouse you-all out." ...|$|R
6000|$|That {{happened}} {{six months}} ago. And now I <b>am</b> beginning <b>to</b> believe it <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> The kitten {{had only the}} magic natural to all kittens, and the soldiers seem as steady a company as any colonel could desire. And Gip--? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is sure <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> I trust?" [...] she resumed, in uneasy accents. [...] "What did {{my father}} say the {{solicitor}} had told him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I so wanted {{everything}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> {{for your}} sake, Luke," [...] said my mother; [...] "I {{know you were}} hoping it would help on the business." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thanks awfully, old man,' he said. 'It's a bit premature, but I fancy it's going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> Come {{along in}} here, and I'll {{tell you about}} it.' ...|$|E
60|$|Went <b>to</b> Waite's. Teeth <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> and white; but he {{says that}} I grind them in my sleep and chip the edges. That same sleep is no friend of mine, though I court him {{sometimes}} for half the twenty-four.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I allow {{he seems}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the goods <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> And I <b>was</b> wrong about its being useless {{to go to}} him. Say, shall we go right away back to the Ritz?" ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the morning}} they <b>were</b> <b>all</b> up very early, and the stranger, who proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a {{seafaring}} man with bright blue eyes, said that, as his cat-boat seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> riding <b>all</b> <b>right</b> at its anchorage, {{he did not}} care to go out after her just yet. Any time during flood-tide would do for him, and he had some business that he wanted to attend to as soon as possible.|$|R
6000|$|... "And pray, Quashy, how do {{you know}} that it's all right, or that I want {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> In short, what business have you to presume to--to--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{the ribs}} seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> But my leg isn't. I shouldn't wonder but what I'll have to limp {{more or less}} {{for the rest of}} my life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, then it's certain <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> It's {{bound to}} turn up some time. They'll send it on by the next train, and you'll get it either to-night or to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good God, it can't be!" [...] he said. [...] "A girl can't {{be killed}} {{with a light}} knock in falling like that. No, no, she'll come <b>to</b> {{presently}} and <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> And we're safe enough--not a soul knows where she is." ...|$|R
6000|$|Just outside, {{stretched}} on a mattress, lay Mr. Morris, wide awake. He raised a warning hand for silence as {{he whispered to}} me, [...] "Hush! Go back <b>to</b> bed. It <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> One of us will <b>be</b> here <b>all</b> night. We don't mean to take any chances!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very little. I {{suppose a}} man isn't {{responsible}} for having foxes that won't break. Did {{you see the}} Senator? He seemed <b>to</b> think it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> Did you hear of John Runce?" [...] Then he {{told the story of}} John Runce, which had <b>been</b> told <b>to</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|... "You mustn't {{let people}} hear you {{saying things like}} that!" [...] he said. [...] "I somehow felt, the moment I began my up-swing, that {{everything}} was going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> I----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Surest thing. But I {{wanted a}} {{straight}} story about--about yourself, you know. When a fellow had a girl--a steady girl--she's got <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> you know. She's {{got to be}} straight goods." ...|$|E
60|$|Ralph walked outside. It was now growing lighter in the east, for it {{was after}} four o'clock in the morning. He looked about the woodshed and the cottage, but {{everything}} appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> Certainly nothing had been stolen.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{glad you}} {{recognize}} the limit in this case," [...] he replied, [...] "but I don't intend <b>to</b> worry. Ben <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> {{and the girl}} has got to have her tragedy sooner or later. If it isn't Ben, it will be somebody else. A wonder it wasn't with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! I {{know all}} the soldier stuff," [...] he admitted, [...] "know my job, that <b>is</b> <b>to</b> say, <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> and of course I am {{moderately}} good at languages, but that finishes me. I haven't any brains like your friend Thomson, for instance." ...|$|R
50|$|Faasle is a {{story about}} the blind sense of duty inculcated by the older {{generation}} and the self-confidence and arrogance of the youth, it {{is a story}} of everyone doing what they believe <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>right,</b> <b>all</b> in the name of Love.|$|R
