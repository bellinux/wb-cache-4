5|$|At SuperBrawl VII on February 23, 1997, <b>the</b> <b>Faces</b> of Fear {{competed in}} a Three Way match. They faced The Public Enemy and Harlem Heat but lost when Rocco Rock from The Public Enemy pinned The Barbarian. At Fall Brawl 1997, The Barbarian and Meng faced Wrath and Mortis. Because Wrath and Mortis {{were part of}} a heel group, WCW had <b>the</b> <b>Faces</b> of Fear compete as faces during the match. Wrath and Mortis won the match, as Wrath pinned Meng for the victory. <b>The</b> <b>Faces</b> of Fear were {{successful}} at World War 3 1997, however, when they defeated the team of Glacier and Ernest Miller.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} Renaissance, {{painters}} such as Duccio di Buoninsegna learned to paint faces {{first with a}} green undercoat, then with pink, which gave <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> a more realistic hue. Over the centuries the pink has faded, making some of <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> look green.|$|E

30|$|Changes in {{lighting}} conditions mainly lead {{to changes}} in the brightness and contrast of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image. After <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image is transformed, <b>the</b> low-frequency <b>face</b> image and <b>the</b> high-frequency <b>face</b> image are obtained. In order to more accurately analyze the influence of illumination on <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image, <b>the</b> low-frequency <b>face</b> image and <b>the</b> high-frequency <b>face</b> image are processed separately. The high-frequency component of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image represents detailed information such as texture and edge, and the high-frequency information of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image is mainly reflected in the position of the eyes, the nose, the lips, the mouth, the wrinkles of <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> and <b>the</b> skin color changes. When the brightness and contrast of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> are changed, <b>the</b> low-frequency components of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> change and <b>the</b> high-frequency components change a little. Therefore, when the illumination causes the grayscale of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image to change, <b>the</b> high-frequency <b>face</b> image is basically unaffected, mainly affecting <b>the</b> low-frequency <b>face</b> image. <b>The</b> <b>face</b> image is transformed by the wavelet transform multi-resolution feature to realize the separate processing of the low-frequency component and the high-frequency component of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image, so that <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image not only contains useful information of face recognition but also avoids the influence of illumination.|$|R

5|$|Crawford and Knight {{were taken}} to Wingenund's camp on June 7, where they found nine other prisoners. On June 11, Captain Pipe painted <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> of the prisoners black, the {{traditional}} sign {{they were to be}} executed. The prisoners were marched to the Delaware town on Tymochtee Creek, near the present-day village of Crawford, Ohio. Four prisoners were killed with tomahawks and scalped along the way. When the war party stopped, the seven remaining prisoners were made to sit, with Crawford and Knight a short distance away from the others. Delaware women and boys killed the other five with tomahawks, beheading one of them. The boys scalped the victims and slapped the bloody scalps in <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> of Crawford and Knight.|$|E
5|$|For the game's {{character}} sculpting and rigging, {{the team}} introduced various new elements {{that were not}} used in their previous games. Lead character technical director Judd Simantov found {{that the creation of}} <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> was the most challenging, in terms of hardware. For <b>the</b> <b>faces,</b> the team used joint-based facial rigs, with some blend-shape correctives. To reta{{in the shape of the}} face and avoid awkward movement, <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> were rigged with the mouth open and eyes slightly closed. <b>The</b> <b>faces</b> were also based on the Facial Action Coding System, allowing for an anatomical-based approach. The use of a higher mesh density also allowed more volumes and creasing in the shape of the face, creating cleaner silhouettes and shapes and giving enough geometry to sculpt correctives. In an attempt to add subtle features, pupil dilation was added to the character models. For the bodies, the team edited the character movements from Uncharted 2, softening some joint alignment. The animation of carpal joints was also added for the game, allowing more dynamic hand shapes, and flexibility. Another subtle addition was the arm mover controls, allowing minor editing on the arms; though this feature was previously available, it was opened up to the animators for The Last of Us. A muscle system was also added, adding muscle shells that bulge, based on attachment joint distance; the muscle system, written in Maya within a few days, works in real time. To solve an issue in which body movement resulted in awkward movement of clothing, runtime helpers were implemented. A total of 326 joints were used in the full character model, with 98 of these in the face; 85 of these are runtime driven, while 241 are locked into animation.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{critical}} commentary varies. One critic {{points out}} that <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> of the rabbits are expressionless while another argues that the cock of an ear or {{the position of a}} tail conveys what <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> lack. One critic believes the tale lacks the vitality of The Tale of Peter Rabbit which sprang from a picture and story letter to a child. Most agree though that the depictions of the garden are exquisite and some of the finest illustrations Potter created.|$|E
6000|$|... 8. And every cherub had two faces--so here; but I read in Ezekiel 10:14, {{that they}} had four <b>faces</b> apiece. <b>The</b> first was <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of a cherubim; <b>the</b> second, <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of a man; <b>the</b> third, <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of a lion; and <b>the</b> fourth, <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of an eagle.|$|R
30|$|Generic shape-based approaches: They use 3 D shapes to {{represent}} <b>the</b> <b>face.</b> For instance, <b>the</b> method proposed in [24] uses a cylinder to map <b>the</b> <b>face</b> in different orientations, {{and then the}} frontal pose of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> is generated. Another method [25] uses an ellipsoid to warp the texture of <b>the</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Faces</b> of Fear {{eventually}} split up, as Meng turned face. The former partners {{faced each}} other at Road Wild 1998; The Barbarian had heel manager Jimmy Hart in his corner. Meng won the match, but The Barbarian, Hugh Morrus and Hart attacked him after the match. Hart later convinced The Barbarian and Meng to reconcile, however, and they wrestled as a tag team again as part of Hart's First Family stable. <b>The</b> <b>Faces</b> of Fear entered a tournament for the WCW World Tag Team Championship in early 1999 after an injury to co-champion Rick Steiner caused the belts to be vacated. According {{to the rules of}} the tournament, teams had to lose two matches before they were eliminated. <b>The</b> <b>Faces</b> of Fear won one match in the tournament, defeating the team of David Taylor and Fit Finlay on the January 25 episode of WCW Monday Nitro. However, they were eliminated after losses to the team of Mike Enos and Bobby Duncum, Jr. and the team of Horace Hogan and Brian Adams. In the latter match, The Barbarian attacked Meng, which caused the loss and led to the team splitting up for good.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between the Dungeon of Doom and the Four Horsemen broke down {{as a result of}} Kevin Sullivan's feud with Horsemen member Chris Benoit. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>Faces</b> of Fear were booked to face Benoit and Steve McMichael, another member of the Four Horsemen, at Halloween Havoc 1996. Benoit pinned Meng to win the match for the Horsemen team. The Barbarian and Meng's next major appearance was at Starrcade 1996, when they faced Scott Hall and Kevin Nash, who were members of another rival heel stable known as the New World Order. Hall and Nash's WCW World Tag Team Championship was on the line, but <b>the</b> <b>Faces</b> of Fear were unable to win the belts, as Nash pinned The Barbarian.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Abbahu {{taught that}} a cherub (as in [...] ) had {{a face like}} a child (keravya), for in Babylonia they called a child ravya. Rav Papa asked Abaye that if this is so, {{then there is a}} {{difficulty}} interpreting , which says of Ezekiel's vision, [...] "the first <b>face</b> was <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of <b>the</b> cherub, and <b>the</b> second <b>face</b> was <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of a man, and <b>the</b> third <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of a lion, and <b>the</b> fourth <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of an eagle." [...] Would not <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of <b>the</b> cherub and <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of a man be the same? The Gemara answered that one was a big <b>face,</b> and <b>the</b> other was a small face.|$|R
40|$|The {{proposed}} {{authentication system}} {{is composed of}} two parts with the following respective functions: detection and extraction of <b>the</b> human <b>face</b> from moving or still images, and classification and recognition of <b>the</b> detected <b>face.</b> <b>The</b> <b>face</b> detection system can acquire the candidate area of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> at high speed with a six-segment-rectangle filter that uses the feature of the tone information around the eyes. Then, the number of candidate areas in a natural image is narrowed down to a small number. An accurate image of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> {{can be obtained by}} investigating the squeezed candidate area in detail. <b>The</b> <b>face</b> recognition system extracts facial characteristics by applying the Gabor filter on <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image obtained by <b>the</b> <b>face</b> detection system. Then, statistically independent elements are extracted by applying the independent component analysis (ICA) to the filtered image, and a face is classified by comparison. We verified both <b>the</b> <b>face</b> detection and face recognition systems. After that, <b>the</b> <b>face</b> authentication system was verified. We confirmed that this system could accurately detect and classify a face...|$|R

5|$|Acting {{also plays}} a key role in Szabó’s films, as he values {{psychological}} complexity in his central characters. In his first several features, he tended to use the same lead actors over and over—first András Bálint, then Klaus Maria Brandauer. Consistent with this focus on acting, he frequently employs long close-up shots to emphasize the play of emotions on <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> of his characters.|$|E
5|$|Arts {{commentator}} Melvyn Bragg {{hosted a}} special edition of The South Bank Show about Paige's career in 1996, titled <b>The</b> <b>Faces</b> of Elaine Paige.

50|$|The 12-color Dogic is {{the more}} {{challenging}} version, where <b>the</b> <b>face</b> centers must be rearranged to match the colors of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> centers in adjacent <b>faces.</b> <b>The</b> triangles must then match the corresponding colors in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> centers. <b>The</b> <b>face</b> centers are mathematically equivalent to the corner pieces of the Megaminx, and so the same algorithms {{may be used for}} solving either. The triangles are relatively easy to solve once <b>the</b> <b>face</b> centers are in place, because the 5 triangles per tip are identical in color and may be freely interchanged.|$|R

5|$|Compared to {{many smaller}} Corvus species (such as American crow), ravens prefer {{undisturbed}} montane or forest habitat or rural areas over urban areas. In other areas, their numbers have increased dramatically {{and they have}} become agricultural pests. Common ravens can cause damage to crops, such as nuts and grain, or can harm livestock, particularly by killing young goat kids, lambs and calves. Ravens generally attack <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> of young livestock, but the more common raven behaviour of scavenging may be misidentified as predation by ranchers.|$|E
5|$|Director Bryan Bertino {{also wrote}} the film's script, which was {{originally}} titled <b>The</b> <b>Faces.</b> Bertino took a {{particular interest in}} the horror genre, noting how one can connect to an audience by scaring them.

5|$|Earlier travels had exposed Géricault {{to victims}} of {{insanity}} and plague, and while researching the Méduse his effort to be historically accurate and realistic led to an obsession with the stiffness of corpses. To achieve the most authentic rendering of the flesh tones of the dead, he made sketches of bodies in the morgue of the Hospital Beaujon, studied <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> of dying hospital patients, brought severed limbs back to his studio to study their decay, and for a fortnight drew a severed head, borrowed from a lunatic asylum and stored on his studio roof.|$|E
50|$|To further brand exposure, {{the company}} signs celebrities for ad campaigns. Brenda Song was <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of Bebe's 2007 ad campaign. The company signed actresses Rebecca Romijn as <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of Bebe from Spring 2007 through Spring 2008 and Eva Longoria as <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of BebeSport from spring 2007 through spring 2009. Mischa Barton was <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of Bebe's 2006 ad campaign.|$|R
5000|$|On <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of <b>the</b> club, {{the center}} portion was {{thickened}} considerably {{to maximize the}} ball speed. For <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> it was made radially thinner. This idea is mainly focused toward forgiveness on shots struck off the center of <b>the</b> <b>face.</b> <b>The</b> thinner metal allows <b>the</b> <b>face</b> to compress more, which in turn will {{reduce the amount of}} excess side spin on the ball, helping to save poorly struck shots.|$|R
