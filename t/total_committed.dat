Our evidence suggests that recent employment growth is likely to have contributed to time poverty and feelings of time-pressure. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of postproduction neutron activation of an enteric-coated pancreatic enzyme preparation for in vivo gastric emptying studies has been investigated. During production of this multicomponent preparation, {{small amounts of}} 170 Er-enriched erbium oxide, suitable for neutron activation, were added. Postproduction neutron irradiation of the labeled preparation resulted in short-lived (7. 5 hr) gamma-emitting 171 Er. Various radiocontaminants, however, are produced also. Because of variations in activation yields, half-lives, decay schemes and radiotoxicities, both major and trace constituents were considered for optimization of both dosimetry and the diagnostic measurement. Conditions were optimized for the best ratio of the committed dose equivalent due to 171 Er to the <b>total</b> <b>committed</b> dose equivalent.

40|$|Abstract Determining {{radioactivity}} {{levels in}} foodstuffs {{is of great}} importance {{for the protection of}} human health. In addition, the literature includes few studies related to this subject in Turkey. In this study, gamma spectroscopic sys-tem was used in order to measure 226 Ra, 232 Th, 40 K and 137 Cs activity concentrations in vegetables and fruits produced in Elazıg ̆ Region. The average activity concentrations in veg-etables was calculated as 0. 64 ± 0. 26 Bq kg- 1 for 226 Ra, 0. 65 ± 0. 14 Bq kg- 1 for 232 Th, 13. 98 ± 1. 22 Bq kg- 1 for 40 K, and 0. 54 ± 0. 04 Bq kg- 1 for 137 Cs.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has significantly increased its <b>total</b> <b>committed</b> lending to countries from about $ 3. 5 billion in August 2008 to about $ 170. 4 billion in August 2009, as countries have been severely affected by the global economic crisis. IMF-supported programs are intended to help countries overcome balance-of-payments problems, stabilize their economies, and restore sustainable economic growth. Critics have long-standing concerns that the IMF has an overly austere approach to macroeconomic policy that does not sufficiently heed country viewpoints. To help address these concerns, the IMF recently stated that it has changed its policies, including by increasing its flexibility. GAO was asked to examine (1) the process for designing an IMF-supported program, (2) the IMF-supported programs in four recipient countries, and (3) {{the extent to which}} the findings of empirical economic studies are consistent with the IMF's macroeconomic policies. GAO analyzed IMF and recipient country documents; interviewed U. S., IMF, and foreign government officials, conducting fieldwork in four relatively large recipient countries; and analyzed published or widely cited empirical studies. GAO received written comments from the Department of the Treasury, noting its concurrence with the report's conclusions. ...|$|E

40|$|A more {{complete}} record is emerging of radionuclide measurements in fish tissue, sediment, and seawater samples from near the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) {{and across the}} Pacific Ocean. Our analysis of publicly available data indicates the dose rates to the most impacted fish species near the FDNPP (median 1. 1 mGy d− 1, 2012 − 2014 data) have remained above benchmark levels for potential dose effects {{at least three years}} longer than was indicated by previous, data-limited evaluations. Dose rates from 134, 137 Cs were highest in demersal species with sediment-associated food chains and feeding behaviors. In addition to 134, 137 Cs, the radionuclide 90 Sr was estimated to contribute up to approximately one-half of the total 2013 dose rate to fish near the FDNPP. Mesopelagic fish 100 − 200 km east of the FDNPP, coastal fish in the Aleutian Islands (3300 km), and trans-Pacific migratory species all had increased dose rates {{as a consequence of the}} FDNPP accident, but their total dose rates remained dominated by background radionuclides.

40|$|The carbon {{stored in}} {{vegetation}} varies spatially and temporally {{due to a}} complex mix of anthropogenic, climatic and edaphic variables. Thus, the success of climate change policy developments such as REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) relies heavily on measuring and understanding this variation in the past, present and future. Here, I first analyse the change in forest cover within a 33. 9 million hectare tropical study area in eastern Tanzania. I develop both linear and non-linear baselines of deforestation, providing evidence that Tanzanian forest policy has resulted in forest transition. I then present an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) ‘Tier 2 ’ reporting-compliant look-up method to estimate regional carbon storage, and associated 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Applying this method to my study area indicates that 1. 58 (95 % CI: 1. 56 - 1. 60) Pg of aboveground live carbon (ALC) was stored across the landscape in the year 2000. Combining these Tier 2 -type values with the historical land use/cover data I derived, I estimate that my study area had a <b>total</b> <b>committed</b> carbon release of 0. 94 (0. 37 - 1. 50) Pg C between 1908 and 2000. However, look-up methods are overly simplistic for heterogeneous landscapes. Using regression equations, including the effects of disturbance, my IPCC ‘Tier 3 ’ compliant estimate for the same region in the year 2000 is 1. 32 (0. 89 - 3. 16) Pg ALC. The most influential variables of carbon storage {{in the region are}} human, the strongest impact variables being the nature of the local governance regime (land under national control contained only 40 - 65 % of the ALC stored in areas under local control) and historical logging (areas that had previously experienced logging held 51 - 77 % of the ALC of never-logged areas). Throughout, I provide spatially explicit estimates to aid decision-makers who, due to the influence of anthropogenic variables, could significantly affect landscape carbon storage across this important area...|$|E
40|$|To {{maintain}} a high system-uniformity and also acceptable water use efficiency in a solid-set sprinkler irrigation system, the <b>total</b> <b>committed</b> pressure variation to subunits should not exceed 20 % {{of the pressure}} head of the sprinkler which operates with the average pressure. Although some references often recommend giving the major part of this pressure variation to laterals, a scientific and precise criterion that allows designers to minimize the costs {{has not yet been}} developed. In this study, regarding the usual design criteria of this system in Iran and also respecting hydraulic rules, an economical analysis was conducted in order to optimize the system based on the appropriated permitted pressure head loss to each subunit. Then, the system irrigates the possible largest area by using minimum weight of pipe. The methodology consisted of 13 slope treatments for each subunit (0, ± 0. 1, ± 0. 5, ± 1, ± 2. 5, ± 5 and ± 10 %) and also the ratio of appropriated allowable head loss to the manifold (2. 5, 5, 7. 5, 10, 12. 5, 15 and 17. 5 %). A simple software was developed to determine the size and the length of the manifold and laterals for each combination as well as their total weight and total irrigated area. Several criteria such as maximum and minimum velocity of water in the pipe, maximum head loss which occurs in 100 m of the manifold, maximum permitted head loss for each subunit and also maximum length of the laterals were considered here in order to derive practical design combinations. Because a constant inlet pressure for each subunit leads to a constant cost of energy, then the ratio of total weight of pipelines to the total irrigated area (Wtot /A 0) was chosen as the standard, which helps to distinguish the best appropriation of allowable head loss to the manifold or laterals. Graphical diagrams were presented to help designers to know how to distribute the total permitted head loss between manifold and laterals. In general, results showed that total pressure head variation of each subunit greatly affects the system costs and also the total optimized appropriated pressure head loss to each subunit is greatly dependent on its own slope...|$|E
