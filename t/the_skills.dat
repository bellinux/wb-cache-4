40|$|The 2 x 2 x 2 Heckscher-Ohlin model {{predicts that}} trade {{openness}} causes <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> premium {{to increase in}} <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> abundant developed countries, and to decrease in <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> scarce developing countries, after trade openness. Empirical evidence, however, shows that <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> premium declined in some developing countries, while others experienced an increase in wage inequality. This paper develops a North-South model, where firms produce a low-skilled and a high-skilled intensive good. The production of a unit of either good involves a continuum of L-tasks and H-tasks. The L-tasks can be performed by low-skilled workers only, and the H-tasks can be performed by high-skilled workers only. The Northern firms can produce the task in their headquarters, or offshore the task to the South. The results suggest there is a threshold skill abundance level in the South, above which countries experience an increase in <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> premium after an improvement in the offshoring technology, and below which countries experience a decrease in <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> premium. In this context, the North offshores the H-tasks to countries that are relatively more abundant in high-skilled labor, and L-tasks to countries that are relatively more abundant in low-skilled labor. Therefore, countries that become the hosts of L-tasks experience a decrease in <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> premium, {{because there will be}} higher demand for their low-skilled workers, while those that become the hosts of the H-tasks will experience an increase in <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> premium, because there will be higher demand for their high-skilled workers.

40|$|ABSTRACT Even {{though there}} are gains from {{international}} trade, {{there is still a}} case that trade opportunities have significant distributional consequences. This study considers the arguments that trade liberalisation and technological catch-up could raise <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> premium. <b>The</b> first argument has shown, in the North-South trade framework, that a reduction in import tariff may raise <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> premium if <b>the</b> tariff reduction causes the range of the traded goods in which export expansion occurs to be greater than the range of the traded goods in which imports expand. The second argument has shown that technological catch-up could raise <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> premium through export expansion. This paper presents an empirical study of developing economies from 1980 to 2005, which confirms that trade liberalisation raises <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> premium, whilst technological catch-up has an insignificant effect on <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> premium.
