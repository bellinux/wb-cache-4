The 30 were committed to prison, while Key was made Deputy Mayor {{to act in the}} absence of the Mayor (Sam March) who was <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>jail.</b> He was a key organiser of the successful campaign to get the councillors released, and subsequently wrote pamphlets telling the history of the campaign. The rates strike secured a more effective system of easing the burden of LCC rates on poorer boroughs and making borough rates produce the same revenue for councils.|$|E

His {{paternal}} grandfather, Behari Lal Gupta, ICS, was the Dewan of Baroda and his elder brother, Ranajit Gupta, ICS, was Chief Secretary of West Bengal. His father, Satish Gupta, who belonged to the IA was an Accountant General of India. After his schooling at Simla, where his father was posted, Gupta studied at St. Stephen's College, Delhi and later went to King's College, Cambridge. While studying in England he came {{under the influence of}} Rajani Palme Dutt and joined the communist movement. With a Tripos from the University of Cambridge he returned to Calcutta in 1938 to join the peasants' and workers' movement. He not only had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>jail</b> for his communist activities but was also sentenced to 'party jail' in 1948 for adopting a soft stand within the party. He went underground in India during 1948–50 when there was a crackdown on Communists.|$|E

500|$|The {{movement}} organizers {{found themselves}} out of money after the amount of required bail was raised. Because King was the major fundraiser, his associates urged him to travel the country to raise bail money for those arrested. He had, however, previously promised to lead the marchers to jail in solidarity, but hesitated as the planned date arrived. Some SCLC members grew frustrated with his indecisiveness. [...] "I have never seen Martin so troubled", one of King's friends later said. After King prayed and reflected alone in his hotel room, he and the campaign leaders decided to defy the injunction and prepared for mass arrests of campaign supporters. To build morale and to recruit volunteers <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>jail,</b> Ralph Abernathy spoke at a mass meeting of Birmingham's black citizens at the 6th Avenue Baptist Church: [...] "The {{eyes of the world}} are on Birmingham tonight. Bobby Kennedy is looking here at Birmingham, the United States Congress is looking at Birmingham. The Department of Justice is looking at Birmingham. Are you ready, are you ready to make the challenge? I am ready <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>jail,</b> are you?" [...] With Abernathy, King was among 50 Birmingham residents ranging in age from 15 to 81 years who were arrested on Good Friday, April 12, 1963. It was King's 13th arrest.|$|E

[...] Schneider was written out of the show in the series' 100th episode, with Jonathan dying of a heart attack on the night of his election victory. Millar and Gough wanted a recognizable face for Smallville; they were happy to cast Schneider as Jonathan because he was known as Bo Duke from The Dukes of Hazzard, which Gough saw as adding to the belief that Schneider could have grown up running a farm.|$|E

On 29 January, the Thai embassy was burned, and hundreds of Thai immigrants fled the country to avoid the violence. During the riots, a caller to Beehive Radio claimed incorrectly that Cambodian embassy officials were killed in Bangkok. On 31 January, Sonando was arrested and accused of [...] "relaying false information", [...] "inciting discrimination", and [...] "inciting crime".

500|$|According to Schneider, Jonathan is [...] "perfectly willing <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>jail,</b> or worse, {{to protect}} his son". The actor characterizes Jonathan as fast to lose his temper, which Schneider views as being a {{development}} of his protective nature over his family. Schneider believes that the season two episode [...] "Suspect"—where Jonathan is arrested, but his sole concern is protecting Clark's secret—summarizes the character well, and shows that the [...] "least important person in Jonathan's life is Jonathan". Schneider admits that occasionally he and Annette O'Toole have to [...] "police" [...] the creative team {{when it comes to}} the relationship between Martha, Jonathan, and Clark. According to Schneider, there are moments where they have to make sure that the characters are not taken to a place they would not normally go, specifically where the parents are useless without the [...] "innate intelligence of [...] teenager".|$|E

[...] Videos of Warren's questioning became popular on the Internet, amassing {{more than one million}} views in a matter of days. At a Banking Committee hearing in March, Warren asked Treasury Department officials why criminal charges were not brought against HSBC for its money laundering practices. With her questions being continually dodged, Warren compared money laundering to drug possession, saying: [...] "If you're caught with an ounce of cocaine, the chances are good you're going <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>jail...</b> But evidently, if you launder nearly a billion dollars for drug cartels and violate our international sanctions, your company pays a fine and you go home and sleep in your own bed at night." ...|$|E

This never, ever happened. They were angrier than I guess they had ever been, because {{everybody}} else had rioted... but the fairies were not supposed to riot... no group had ever forced cops to retreat before, so the anger was just enormous. I mean, they wanted to kill." [...] With larger numbers, police detained anyone they could and put them in patrol wagons <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>jail,</b> though Inspector Pine recalled, [...] "Fights erupted with the transvestites, who wouldn't go into the patrol wagon."

500|$|Many major {{editorial}} pages and columnists have been {{sympathetic to the}} supporters of the Jena Six. They have used the case to discuss broader trends of racism in the US criminal justice system and {{to call for a}} renewed civil rights movement. Most editorials were published {{around the time of the}} Jena rally. The New York Post, in a September 23, 2007, editorial, stated [...] "it's impossible to examine the case of the so-called Jena Six without concluding that these black teens have been the victims of a miscarriage of justice, with a clearly racial double standard at work." [...] Byron Williams, writing on the Huffington Post, was one of several to cite the Urban League's 2005 finding that the average black male convicted of aggravated assault serves 48months in prison, one-third longer than a comparable white man. The 2005 report also found that a black male who is arrested is three times more likely <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>jail</b> than a white male arrested for the same crime. Citing the same statistics, syndicated columnist Clarence Page wrote that [...] "The best legacy for the Jena March 6would be a new movement, dedicated this time to the reduction and elimination of unequal justice wherever it appears. I don't care who leads it, but it shouldn't be for blacks only." [...] Writing in the New York Times, Professor Orlando Patterson of Harvard University used the case to highlight the use of the prison system as a means of [...] "controlling young black men", which is one factor in a broader [...] "crisis in relations between men and women of all classes and, as a result, the catastrophic state of black family life".|$|E

Nevertheless, two organizations with which Robeson was intimately involved, the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) and the CAA, were placed on the Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations (AGLOSO).
