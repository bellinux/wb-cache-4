All of sudden I'm diagnosed manic-depressive. 'Let's put Axl on medication.' Well, the medication doesn't help me deal with stress. The only thing it does is help keep people off my back because they figure I'm on medication." ...|$|E
500|$|The Shadows (consisting of {{band members}} Brian Bennett, Hank Marvin, John Rostill and Bruce Welch) as Themselves, {{complementing}} Cliff Richard Jr in Alan Tracy's dream sequence set at The Swinging Star. Bennett remembers the puppet {{that was based}} on his likeness: [...] "The first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to ask if I could keep him when filming was finished, but apparently he was to be turned into another character after the film had been finished." ...|$|E
2500|$|Uncharted 2 also {{received}} praise from other developers. [...] producer Gordon Van Dyke stated [...] "Uncharted 2 is an amazing-looking game. But we're reaching {{that level of}} quality. It's {{going to be hard}} for any game to be able to make a claim that they look better... to even be close, to me is quite an honour as a developer. The one <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was,</b> when I looked at their game I was like, damn them! What have they done to the rest of us? I was looking for something where I could say, okay, that we're doing better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That’s me, ma’am," [...] {{said the}} gentleman mentioned, {{shaking his head}} despairingly. [...] "That’s Bill Brisket all over. I come blundering in, and the first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to blurt out secrets; then, when I try to smooth it over——" ...|$|R
500|$|In December 2008, García Márquez told fans at the Guadalajara book {{fair that}} writing had worn him out. In 2009, {{responding}} to claims by both his literary agent and his biographer that his writing career was over, he told Colombian newspaper El Tiempo: [...] "Not {{only is it}} not true, but the only <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> write".|$|R
50|$|So I {{guess the}} best <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> can <b>do,</b> <b>is</b> just {{to cut and}} run.|$|R
6000|$|The next <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to {{take the}} liberty which she had already sanctioned--I mean the liberty of reading what she had written. Here it is, copied exactly: ...|$|E
60|$|Having {{arrived at}} that valiant resolution, the first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to lock and bolt {{the back and}} front doors, and see to the {{security}} of every shutter in the house.|$|E
6000|$|... "The first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to fall aff the flower-pot; but syne I came to, {{and says}} I, wi' a polite smirk, 'I'm {{thinking}} your leddyship,' says I, 'as you're the bonniest yourself.'" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{struck me}} that the best <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> <b>was</b> {{to shake hands with}} the wrathful foreman, and <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it very heartily.|$|R
60|$|The best <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to wipe my pen, {{and shut}} up my Journal, and go home by the next train.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{the very}} <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{going to ask you}} to burn--or, at least, get rid of--all my {{philosophical}} literature. It is in the bookcases in your rooms. The fact is, I never cared much for abstruse studies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I must {{be just as}} much {{to blame}} as you," [...] Walter replied, in a {{trembling}} voice. [...] "My business was to stand watch, and the very first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to go to sleep." ...|$|E
60|$|Upon these apprehensions, {{the first}} <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to go quite {{out of my}} knowledge, and go by another name. This I did effectually, for I went into the Mint too, took lodgings in a very private place, dressed up {{in the habit of}} a widow, and called myself Mrs. Flanders.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Longdon {{turned from}} his contemplation with a visible effort. [...] "I {{feel obliged to}} you for taking it so; it mightn't--one never knows--have amused you. As I told you there, the first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to ask Fernanda about the company; and when she {{mentioned}} your name I immediately said: 'Would he like me to speak to him?'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! we do go on," [...] said Ethel, smiling; [...] "the worst <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> have <b>done</b> <b>was</b> expecting James {{to dress}} the salads with lamp-oil." ...|$|R
2500|$|An article which {{appeared}} in The Southeast Missourian discussed that Norton credited Napoleon Hill's philosophy for his success. To quote from the article, [...] "Norton says he's a believer in Napoleon Hill's philosophy, that a person can do anything he puts his mind to. 'So I train for my fights,' he says, 'mentally as well as physically. One <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> only watch films of the fights in which I've done well or in which my opponent has done poorly.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's unlikely," [...] he {{answered}} in a hard voice. [...] "I've lost my friends with my character. The best <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to leave them alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hey! are {{you ever}} going to get up?" [...] some one yelled into my drowsy brain. I roused and opened my eyes. The yellow, {{flickering}} shadows on the wall of my tent told me that the sun had long risen. I found my companions finishing breakfast. The first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to look over the dogs. Shep, the black-and-white pup, was missing.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} I {{had taken it}} in, and then the first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to spring up and ask how she could leave the boy still in the woman's power, to which she {{answered}} that she had walked them back to Spinney Lawn--a whole mile--and that Lady Hester could not set forth again, now that Alured had heard the conversation.|$|E
60|$|Another <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to {{rearrange}} our watches aft {{so as to}} split up the three storm-visitors. Margaret took one in her watch, along with the two sail-makers, Tom Spink, and Louis. Louis is half white, and all trustworthy, so that, at all times, on deck or below, he is told off {{to the task of}} never letting the topaz-eyed one out of his sight.|$|E

5000|$|For me {{the really}} {{satisfying}} <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>are</b> offered me, free, for nothing. Ever {{go out in}} the fall and do a little hunting? See the frost on the grass and the leaves turning? Spend a day in the hills alone, or with good companions? Watch a sunset and a moonrise? Notice a bird in the wind? A stream in the woods, a storm at sea, cross the country by train, and catch a glimpse of something beautiful in the desert, or the farmlands? Free to everybody ... Gary Cooper ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{pray for}} you all my life," [...] she said. [...] "Every night, when I retire to rest, the last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to {{remember}} you by name." ...|$|R
60|$|You see, the {{combination}} started this way. When I {{got up to}} Redding and had become a doctor, I looked {{around to see what}} my chances were for aiding in, the great work. The first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to determine what manner of doctor I was to be. Being a Connecticut farmer, I naturally consulted my farmacopia, and at once decided to become a farmeopath.|$|E
6000|$|... "The first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> {{to put my}} {{head down}} {{the square of the}} midship ventilator. As I lifted the lid a visible breath, {{something}} like a thin fog, a puff of faint haze, rose from the opening. The ascending air was hot, and had a heavy, sooty, paraffiny smell. I gave one sniff, and put down the lid gently. It was no use choking myself. The cargo was on fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I didn't do it," [...] she continued, [...] "for there wasn't no {{soft water}} {{underneath}} {{for her to}} fall into. After we went to bed I kep' awake for a long time, bein' afraid she'd {{get up in the}} night an' turn on all the gases and smother me alive. But I fell asleep at last, an' when I woke up, early in the mornin', the first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to feel for that lunertic. But she was gone!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm on the mainland, that's certain," [...] he told himself. [...] "I {{guess the}} best <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> <b>is</b> {{to wait for}} {{daylight}} before going further. I may only--Hullo, a light!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{might have}} {{told me she was}} tired," [...] Emily said to herself quietly. [...] "Well! the best <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to put out the light and follow her example." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid it's {{getting too}} much for dear, old dad," [...] was Dick's comment, on perusing this message. [...] "I think the best <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to get back and help him." ...|$|R
60|$|The first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>was</b> {{to dismiss}} my visitor, the Dutch captain, whom I {{had a great}} deal of reason to think myself {{exceedingly}} obliged to: and, first, I handsomely rewarded his men, to whom I gave four pieces of eight a man; and having waited on the captain to the ship's side, and seen him into his boat, I fired him twenty-one guns at his going off; for which he fired twenty-five when he came on board his ship.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} I ain't. He's {{written a letter}} to Lord Hampstead, who has always been my friend. Hampstead wasn't going to see me treated after that fashion. Hampstead wrote, and then Æolus wrote,--that's Sir Boreas,--and I've seen the letter,--that is, Hampstead told me what there is in it; and I ain't to be {{dismissed}} at all. When I heard the good news the first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to come as fast as my legs would carry me, and tell the girl of my heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And he has {{the nicest}} little ears, Mrs. Doctor, dear," [...] said Susan. [...] "The first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> {{to look at his}} ears. Hair is {{deceitful}} and noses and eyes change, and you cannot tell what is going to come of them, but ears is ears from start to finish, and you always know where you are with them. Just look at their shape--and they are set right back against his precious head. You will never need to be ashamed of his ears, Mrs. Doctor, dear." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{felt the}} only <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> <b>was</b> {{to ask her}} to marry me. And when I saw the joy that came into her poor, tear-stained face <b>I</b> knew I'd <b>done</b> the right thing.|$|R
6000|$|... "It’s no good," [...] said Rosa, eying him mournfully. [...] "You can’t deceive me. You are {{head over}} heels, and the kindest <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to be cruel to you—for your own sake." ...|$|R
6000|$|Grant smiled wearily as {{he shook}} his head. [...] "No," [...] he said. [...] "The one <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> can't <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to lift my hand against the men I brought here in a private quarrel." ...|$|R
