30|$|No {{significant}} difference in the string and <b>tack-free</b> <b>time</b> is observed. However, the foam with microspheres can be cut 5 minutes earlier than the reference sample (foam without microparticles), which means it is curing faster. The slight difference suggests that the amount of microparticles used in the test is not enough to produce a {{significant difference}}.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Rigid {{polyurethane}} foams (RPUFs) were fabricated from crude MDI (CMDI) and polypropylene glycols (PPGs) {{of various}} isocyanate indices with a physical blowing agent (HFC 365 mfc). There was {{a tendency for}} the gel time to decrease and the <b>tack-free</b> <b>time</b> to increase with increasing index value. With increasing index value the foam density and compression strength decreased and the glass transition temperature, dimension stability and ther-mal insulation increased, while the cell size and closed cell content were virtually unchanged. Allophanate crosslinks and condensation reactions between the isocyanate groups, which are favored with a high index value, exerted sig-nificant effects on the properties of RPUFs...|$|E
40|$|The rigid {{polyurethane}} foams (RPUFs) {{have been}} fabricated from high functional crude 4, 4 ’-di-phenylmethane diisocyanate (CMDI) and polypropylene glycols (PPGs) {{for a wide}} range of surfactant concentration with an environmently friendly blowing agent (HFC 365 mfc). Cream time, gel time, and <b>tack-free</b> <b>time</b> increased with the addition of surfactant. Foam density decreased rapidly to a minimum at 0. 5 pphp (part per hundred polyol) surfactant due to the increased blowing efficiency with surfactant. Surface tension rapidly decreased to an asymptotic value at 2 pphp surfactant. In accordance with this, cell size decreased and closed cell content increased rapidly to constant values at low surfactant concentrations (< 1 pphp). The decrease of cell size was accompanied by the decrease of thermal conductivity to give a linear relatiohship between the two implying that the series model of heat transfer is applicable...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this study, fast-curing {{shielding}} {{materials were}} prepared with a two-component polyurethane matrix and {{a filler material}} of PbO through a one-step, laboratory-scale method. With {{an increase in the}} filler content, viscosity increased. However, the two components showed a small difference. Curing time decreased as the filler content increased. The minimum <b>tack-free</b> <b>time</b> of 27  s was obtained at a filler content of 70  wt%. Tensile strength and compressive strength initially increased and then decreased as the filler content increased. Even when the filler content reached 60  wt%, mechanical properties were still greater than those of the matrix. Cohesional strength decreased as the filler content increased. However, cohesional strength was still greater than 100  kPa at a filler content of 60  wt%. The γ-ray-shielding properties increased with the increase in the filler content, and composite thickness could be increased to improve the shielding performance when the energy of γ-rays was high. When the filler content was 60  wt%, the composite showed excellent comprehensive properties...|$|E
40|$|Methyltrimethoxysilane {{has been}} used as a base in the {{formation}} of transparent sol-gel coatings on glass substrates. Several types of alcohol were used as solvents in order to obtain the highest transparency and scratch hardness of the film. The coating cures at room temperature (26 ∘C). The clarity of the coated film on the glass substrate was measured using haze meter. The best formulation based on the lowest haze values and light diffusion is the ratio of 1 [*]:[*] 1 trimethoxy silane to N-propanol. The haze value obtained for this system is 0. 86, and the light diffusion was measured at 0. 77 %. <b>Tack-free</b> <b>time</b> and hardness were within acceptable value. Nanoparticles of silver, zinc oxide, and titanium dioxide were incorporated into the coating system from 0. 5 % to 2. 5 % by weight, and the haze values of the dried film were measured. The highest transparency was obtained from the samples that were mixed with 0. 5 % silver. The haze value for this sample is of 0. 5...|$|E
