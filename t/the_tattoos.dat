5|$|This {{narrative}} for Tommy {{is set in}} {{deep space}} in a small, self-contained biosphere bubble spaceship. Jackman's character in this plot is alone, flying in outer space toward the golden nebula of Xibalba with a large tree and a few personal effects comprising his ship. While traveling, he meditates, performs t'ai chi, grows mushrooms and cuts pieces of bark from the tree for nourishment. He also converses with apparitions of Izzi. It is implied that the tree within the biosphere also represents Izzi and that Tommy has been transporting it to Xibalba {{with the hope that}} she will be restored to him. Tommy is also shown to have applied extensive, incremental tattooed ring patterns to both of his arms similar to the tattoo of his engagement ring from Izzi in 2006; it is implied that <b>the</b> <b>tattoos</b> mark the passage of time on his journey in 2500.|$|E

25|$|Together with Keith Mann and Danny Attwood, Horne {{was part}} of a small Animal Liberation Front cell that raided Harlan Interfauna, a British company in Cambridge that {{supplies}} laboratory animals and organs, on 17 March 1990, Horne's 38th birthday. The activists entered Interfauna's animal units through holes they punched in the roof, removing 82 beagle puppies and 26 rabbits. They also removed documents listing Interfauna's customers, which included Boots, Glaxo, Beechams, and Huntingdon Research Centre, {{as well as a number}} of universities. A vet who was an ALF supporter removed <b>the</b> <b>tattoos</b> from the dogs' ears, and they were dispersed to new homes across the UK. As a result of evidence found at the scene and in one of the activists' homes, Mann and Attwood were convicted of conspiracy to burgle and were sentenced to nine months and 18 months respectively.|$|E
25|$|That year, Gardner {{moved to}} Borneo, gaining {{employment}} as a rubber planter at the Mawo Estate at Membuket. However, {{he did not}} get on well with the plantation's manager, a racist named R. J. Graham who had wanted to deforest the entire local area. Instead Gardner became friendly with many of the locals, including the Dyak and Dusun people. An amateur anthropologist, Gardner was fascinated by the indigenous way of life, particularly the local forms of weaponry such as the sumpitan. He was intrigued by <b>the</b> <b>tattoos</b> of the Dayaks and pictures of him in later life show large snake or dragon tattoos on his forearms, presumably obtained at this time. Taking a great interest in indigenous religious beliefs, Gardner told his first biographer that he had attended Dusun séances or healing rituals. He was unhappy with the working conditions and the racist attitudes of his colleagues, and when he developed malaria he felt that this was the last straw; he left Borneo and moved to Singapore, in what was then known as the Straits Settlements, part of British Malaya.|$|E

50|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>tattoo</b> {{was widely}} used in the early war years, {{over the course of}} the war it was {{gradually}} applied to fewer and fewer soldiers, and towards the end of the war having <b>the</b> <b>tattoo</b> was more <b>the</b> exception rather than the rule. The application of <b>the</b> <b>tattoo</b> to foreign volunteers was apparently an issue of contention, with some, such as the British Free Corps not required to have it, while other foreign units did not object. Very little specific information exists regarding <b>the</b> <b>tattoo</b> and foreign units, but it is claimed by some that the men of the 33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French) had <b>the</b> <b>tattoo</b> applied.

500|$|The creature's {{appearance}} {{was inspired by}} {{an image of a}} woman with a henna-tattooed back that Kripke found on the internet. He thought it would be intriguing to have the villain's entire body tattooed. The actor who portrayed the djinnMackenzie Grayhad a shaved head, so special effects makeup artist Toby Lindala only used a minor prosthetic to cover Gray's eyebrows. Lindala found <b>the</b> <b>tattoos</b> to be a [...] "particular challenge" [...] because they were [...] "intricate designs". [...] The production schedule could not accommodate the six hours needed to apply the makeup each day, so the actor was booked with the condition that the make-up not be removed for four days. Gray's personal life was affected by this, as people on the street were scared by his appearance. Lindala was surprised that Gray was able to keep <b>the</b> <b>tattoos</b> undamaged outside of filming.|$|E

He finds Pharod, who is the chief of an underground village of scavengers, and retrieves a magical bronze sphere for him. In return, Pharod gives him further hints to piece together his forgotten past. Later on, The Nameless One learns from a powerful sorcerer named Lothar that the night hag Ravel Puzzlewell caused his immortality, but the hag is currently imprisoned in a magical maze by the Lady of Pain.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Tattoo</b> {{originated}} from a special display for Queen Victoria in 1894 and soon became {{an event in}} itself.

500|$|Although Jack had tattoos {{on his arm}} {{the entire}} series, their origin had never been explained. Matthew Fox {{received}} <b>the</b> <b>tattoos</b> before Lost was even created. The producers considered putting make-up over them, but instead, decided just to keep them and fit it in with the plot. According to Assistant Professor Xinping Zhu of Northeastern University, the tattoo {{is made up of}} four Chinese characters from a poem written by Mao Zedong in 1925. Fox's tattoo translates to [...] "Eagles high up, cleaving the space". (In this episode however, one of [...] "the Others" [...] tells Jack that his tattoo translates as: [...] "He walks among us, but he is not one of us." [...] Jack replies, [...] "That's what they say, that's not what they mean.") [...] The number 5 can also be seen on Fox's forearm; he got that tattoo while working on Party of Five, along with another cast member. In an interview, Fox said that for him, getting a tattoo was a [...] "pretty intense experience", and something he would not do in the [...] "spur of the moment". He thought Jack having tattoos was a [...] "really cool idea". Since Fox used tattoos to represent memories or meaningful events in his life, the writers took a similar approach when dealing with Jack's tattoos.|$|E
500|$|On February 8, 2011, Gaga tweeted {{the words}} [...] "Trois Jours" [...] ("Three Days"), {{along with a}} picture of the {{official}} single artwork, via TwitPic. Gaga is shown topless in the black-and-white cover art and displays <b>the</b> <b>tattoos</b> on her back. Her hair is air-blown and she wears heavy make-up while sharp edges protrude from her face and shoulders. The artwork was described by Charlie Amter from The Hollywood Reporter as harkening back to the classic record covers from the 1980s. He compared it to the artworks by bands like Missing Persons, Roxy Music and Duran Duran. Gordon Smart from The Sun also felt that the [...] "stark black and white image" [...] had a glossy eighties air about it. Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly gave a positive review of the cover art, feeling that Gaga looked almost [...] "animalistic" [...] in the picture, and her flowing hair made her look like a creature from the African jungle. She also added that the artwork was [...] "totally and completely fierce". Archana Ram from the same publication found similarities between the [...] "Born This Way" [...] cover art and [...] Kylie Minogue's cover art for her 2007 single [...] "2 Hearts". Nicole Eggenberger from OK! described the artwork as a perfect balance between the singer's [...] "wild side" [...] and her [...] "glamorous" [...] looks.

500|$|In {{keeping with}} {{previous}} entries, the story {{focused on a}} single protagonist rather than a group as in other role-playing games of the time to promote full player immersion. The main protagonist was the first character to be created, being featured in the first Alpha build. So as to include a feeling of [...] "digitality" [...] in the game, the main character was designed as something akin to a human computer. This approach {{was inspired by the}} special make-up used in David Cronenberg's 1983 horror film Videodrome. While the protagonist was originally designed with keyboards growing from inside him, Kaneko felt uncomfortable with that and instead redesigned him with full-body tattoos. <b>The</b> <b>tattoos</b> were intended to convey the character's demon powers, act as an obvious stigma in place of wings or horns, and be a reference to real-world shamans who commonly made themselves stand out using tattoos. Kaneko's inspiration for the main character's design was the American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers: according to Kaneko, he [...] "imagined [...] running around the desert naked". The main character was initially going to use one of the series' recurring arm-mounted COMP computers, but as he had already become a demon hybrid, it did not make sense to include it. As he was the character controlled by the player, more focus was given to embodying and reflecting his world view than to developing a personality. In keeping with the game's theme of energy remaking reality, Kaneko dressed his character in comfortable shorts to balance against his tattoos. The spike growing from the main character's neck, the Magatama fused with him {{at the beginning of the}} game, was inspired by the theory that a person's aura appears as a shark fin sticking out of the back of their neck when viewed from the side.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{increasingly}} popular use of brand symbols as imagery for tattooing. Through interviews with tattoo artists and netnographic research in tattoo communities, we capture a perceived {{boundary between the}} sacred, non-commercial sphere of <b>tattooing</b> and <b>the</b> profane, profit maximizing sphere of the commercial world. In <b>the</b> <b>tattoo</b> subcul-ture, brands are generally considered inappropriate for <b>tattooing.</b> Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>tattoo</b> artists more or less willingly accept the role of service providers for consumers wishing to embody brand symbols. The commercial sphere hence {{plays a role in}} the cultural identity of <b>the</b> <b>tattoo</b> culture as an Otherness, from which <b>the</b> <b>tattoo</b> culture defines itself...|$|R
50|$|The Court {{also held}} that <b>the</b> {{business}} of <b>tattooing</b> {{does not affect}} whether or not <b>the</b> process of <b>tattooing</b> is free expression. The sale of artwork does not remove the expressive content from being protected by the First Amendment. This protection does not become diminished as the artwork is sold. The Court noted that the sale of <b>the</b> <b>tattoo</b> is intertwined with <b>the</b> process of <b>tattooing</b> and <b>the</b> <b>tattoo</b> itself. <b>The</b> business of <b>tattooing</b> is therefore pure expressive activity that is entitled to full protection under the First Amendment.|$|R
2500|$|Tattoos were {{probably}} {{also used in}} ancient medicine {{as part of the}} treatment of the patient. In 1898, Daniel Fouquet, a medical doctor, wrote an article on “medical tattooing” practices in Ancient Egypt, in which he describes the tattooed markings on the female mummies found at the Deir el-Bahari site. He speculated that <b>the</b> <b>tattoos</b> and other scarifications observed on the bodies may have served a medicinal or therapeutic purpose: [...] "The examination of these scars, some white, others blue, leaves in no doubt that they are not, in essence, ornament, but an established treatment for a condition of the pelvis, very probably chronic pelvic peritonitis." ...|$|E
