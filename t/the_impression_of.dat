5|$|Because {{the south}} {{transept}} {{is similar in}} dimension to the nave and choir, views of the building from the south-east and south-west give <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> a building balanced around a central axis, with its tower as the hub.

5|$|Four main {{proposals}} were suggested {{for the new}} fixed link.

5|$|In 1935, the United States Navy Naval Research Laboratory began {{studies and}} tests on low {{visibility}} camouflage for ships.

5|$|Paths, arbors, and fences use {{traditional}} or antique looking materials.

In Exp. 2, Ss told that their ratings would be lumped {{into a group}} average showed assimilation, whereas Ss told that their ratings would be examined individually showed contrast. In Exp. 3, <b>the</b> <b>impressions</b> <b>of</b> Ss low in need for cognition showed assimilation, whereas <b>the</b> <b>impressions</b> <b>of</b> Ss high in need for cognition showed contrast. Exp. 1 also showed that the results were not {{due to differences in}} recall of the target information, and Exp. 3 showed that the results were not due to differences in recall of the priming stimuli. Together, the results suggest that the processes involved in contrast demand more cognitive effort than do the processes involved in assimilation. The context in which a stimulus is embedded can have signifi-cant effects on people's judgment of that stimulus. The two effects that have been most reliably demonstrated are assimila-tion and contrast. Assimilation refers to a positive relation be-tween the value people place on a target stimulus and the valu...|$|R

5|$|The episode's opening scene, {{featuring}} a camera moving slowly towards Scully in a harsh white light, {{was achieved by}} constructing a long narrow set covered in aluminium foil, which amplified the light being used and downplayed any colors.

5|$|The final {{versions}} of the sonatas convey <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> a single unit, and were likely notated in close succession during September 1828.

As compared to the sketches, the final versions are written much more neatly and orderly, with full notation and greater care for small details.|$|E
5|$|This new {{constructional}} technique allowed Gaudí {{to achieve}} his greatest architectural goal; to perfect and go beyond Gothic style. The hyperboloid vaults have their centre where Gothic vaults had their keystone, and the hyperboloid allows for a hole in this space to let natural light in.

However, in practice the territory of South Tyrol within the boundaries defined by Germany as Operationszone Alpenvorland that included Trent, Bolzano, and Belluno, were de facto incorporated into Germany's Reichsgau Tirol-Vorarlberg and administered by its Gauleiter Franz Hofer.

5|$|Built between 1079 and 1532, Winchester Cathedral has had {{an unusual}} {{architectural}} history. The exterior, apart from the modified windows, gives <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> a massive Norman building and indeed, it is the longest medieval church in the world. However, the west front is now Perpendicular, with its huge window filled with fragments of medieval glass. Inside, only the crypt and the transepts have retained their Norman appearance. The spectacular Perpendicular nave with its tall arcade arches and strong vertical emphasis has been literally {{carved out of the}} original Norman interior. The Very Rev. Sykes wrote of it “Well might the visitor who enters … by the west door gasp with amazement.” Winchester is also famous for its carved wooden fittings of many different periods.|$|E

They were tasked with convincing the Turks that the next British attack would be from the Jordan Valley, while the forces were actually being realigned to attack in the west.
