5|$|Strategic design {{management}} involves {{the creation of}} strategic long-term vision and planning for design, and deals with defining the role of design within the company. The goal of strategic {{design management}} is to support and strengthen the corporate visio by creating {{a relationship between the}} design and corporate strategy. It includes the creation of design, brand and product strategies, ensuring that design management becomes a central element in the corporate strategy formulation process. Strategic design management is responsible for <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>and</b> <b>implementation</b> of a corporate design programme that influences the design vision, mission, and positioning. It allows design to interact with the needs of corporate management and focuses on the long-term capabilities of design. Where strategic design management is applied, there is often a strong belief in the potential to differentiate the company and gain competitive advantage by design. As a result, design thinking becomes integrated into the corporate culture. Depending on the type of company and industry the following job titles are associated with this function: design strategist, strategic design manager, chief design officer, vice president design and innovation, chief creative officer, innovation design director, and others.|$|E
