5|$|The Selle Français stud {{book has}} long allowed {{crossbreeding}} {{with four other}} breeds: the Thoroughbred, Arabian, Anglo-Arabian and French Trotter. Today, restrictions exist to harmonize the stud book with directives for other European warmblood breeds. For a Selle Français <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>registered,</b> it must be from two registered Selle Français parents or from {{a cross between a}} Selle Français and a facteur de selle français (non-Selle Français horse that has passed stud book selection procedures). Stallions must pass through a selection process before their progeny is allowed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>registered</b> as Selle Français. The process involves an approval committee that judges stallions on criteria based on the age, breed and nationality of the horses. The qualification criteria involve the conformation, gaits, performance and are scored against national indices.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{prior to}} the {{restructuring}} of the French Limousin Herd Book in 2008, French breeders had two months to nominate the class (Pureblood or Purebred) in which they wanted their cattle <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>registered.</b> Pureblood cattle have higher business value than Purebreds because they are preferred by French breeders. Also, Full French cattle benefit under a branded meat marketing label known as Blason Prestige Label Rouge, which has around 800 outlets in France.|$|E

5|$|On May 28, 2003, a Haflinger filly named Prometea {{became the}} first horse clone born. Bred by Italian scientists, she was cloned from a mare skin cell, and was a healthy foal. In 2008, Prometea herself {{gave birth to the}} first {{offspring}} of an equine clone, a colt named Pegaso sired by a Haflinger stallion through artificial insemination. The American Haflinger Registry does not allow horses born as a result of cloning <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>registered,</b> although as of 2010 other nations' registries have not yet entered a decision on the topic. In January 2012, Breyer Horses created a model horse of the Haflinger.|$|E

5|$|Several laws {{dealt with}} indentured servitude, a legal status whereby {{a person would}} work off debts or be given {{training}} {{in exchange for a}} period of unrecompensed service. The law required that all indentured servants had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>registered</b> by the Governor or one of the Assistants, and that no period of indenture could be less than six months. Further laws forbade a master from shortening the length of time of service required for his servant, and also confirmed that any indentured servants whose period of service began in England would still be required to complete their service while in Plymouth.|$|E
5|$|While still a three-year-old, he was {{exported}} to England {{where he was}} registered in the General Stud Book. He was imported by Richard Croker, {{at a cost of}} about 8000 guineas. Americus' importation to England occurred before the imposition of the Jersey Act, which allowed him and his offspring <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>registered</b> in the General Stud Book, something that would not have happened had he been imported into England after 1913, due to the Jersey Act's prohibition on registering horses tracing to Lexington in the General Stud Book.|$|E
5|$|A ruling of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 6 August 2017 {{decided that}} a disputed {{military}} facility in Han Pijesak is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>registered</b> as property of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It {{is expected to be}} a precedent for all other similar facilities, and could thus be the final factor that will enable the activation of the MAP for Bosnia. An August 2010 poll showed that 70 percent of the country supports NATO membership, but results were very different in the two constituent entities. While 90 percent of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina supported NATO membership, only 33 percent in Republika Srpska did.|$|E

5|$|Article 14(3) {{provides}} {{that the right}} to form associations may also be restricted by any law relating to labour or education. The Trade Unions Act regulates labour organizations, while schools are generally required <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>registered</b> under either the Education Act or the Private Education Act. Under the Education Act, it is an offence for pupils or other persons to assemble on the premises of a school the registration of which has been cancelled. Statutes governing universities provide that student bodies created pursuant to a university's constituent documents must be registered under the Societies Act unless the Minister for Home Affairs has exempted such bodies.|$|E
5|$|As it {{has been}} since the {{creation}} of the Auxois stud book, only purebred horses and Ardennes and Trait du Nord crosses are allowed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>registered.</b> This is to ensure selection for the desired breed characteristics, which are now a lighter and more active horse than was seen during the time of breeding for horse meat. Horses bred through artificial insemination and embryo transfer are allowed to be registered; those potentially bred through cloning are not. The Syndicat du Cheval de Trait Auxois (Auxois Draft Horse Association) is the national registry, managing the stud book, breed standard and promotion of the breed. An annual breed competition is held in September in Semur-en-Auxois.|$|E
5|$|On 23 October 1940, the German Military Administration adopted anti-Jewish {{legislation}} {{for the first}} time. The new laws, similar to the Nuremberg Laws adopted in Germany in 1935, coincided with the adoption of similar legislation in the Netherlands and in France. The laws of 28 October forbade Jews to practice certain professions (including the civil service) and forced Jews to register with their local municipality. On the same date, the German administration announced a definition of who was regarded as Jewish. Jewish-owned shops or businesses had to be marked by a sign in the window, and Jewish-owned economic assets had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>registered.</b> From June 1940, a list of Jewish businesses had already been drawn up in Liège.|$|E

5|$|Other {{aspects of}} the excise law also caused concern. The law {{required}} all stills <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>registered,</b> and those cited for failure to pay the tax had to appear in distant Federal, rather than local courts. The only Federal courthouse was in Philadelphia, some 300 {{miles away from the}} small frontier settlement of Pittsburgh. From the beginning, the Federal government had little success in collecting the whiskey tax along the frontier. Many small western distillers simply refused to pay the tax. Federal revenue officers and local residents who assisted them bore the brunt of the protester's ire. Tax rebels harassed several whiskey tax collectors and threatened or beat those who offered them office space or housing. As a result, many western counties never had a resident Federal tax official.|$|E
5|$|The monastery runs a {{fundraising}} {{program for}} cataract {{operations in the}} city, and receives wide support due to public suspicion of charities affiliated with the ruling Communist Party government, due to the communists' strong reputation for rampant corruption. Following the fall of Saigon and the communist takeover, religious bodies were required <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>registered</b> with and loyal to the party. The khat si complied {{and became one of}} the nine schools within the state-sanctioned Vietnamese Buddhist Congregation. However, the temple does not fly the national flag, and the only government material or symbols on display within Tịnh Xá Trung Tâm are letters of congratulations for charity initiatives.|$|E
5|$|Bred {{throughout}} France, the Selle Français {{has been}} exported worldwide, with additional stud books formed in Great Britain and the United States. Horses {{registered with the}} stud books must undergo inspections which judge their conformation, gaits and performance. Horses of other breeds who pass the inspections, including those of Thoroughbred, Arabian, Anglo-Arabian and French Trotter bloodlines, {{may be used for}} breeding, with the progeny able <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>registered</b> as Selle Français. Selle Français have proven successful at the international level of competition in many equestrian disciplines. They are most commonly seen in show jumping, eventing and dressage, although they are also seen in combined driving, equestrian vaulting and competitive trail riding competitions. Selle Français and their riders have won numerous medals in the Summer Olympics and World Equestrian Games, including making up the entire gold-medal French teams in show jumping at the 2002 World Equestrian Games and eventing at the 2004 Summer Olympics.|$|E
