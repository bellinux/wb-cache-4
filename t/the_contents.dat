30|$|A {{watermark}} is {{a signal}} that is embedded in <b>the</b> <b>content</b> to produce a watermarked <b>content.</b> <b>The</b> watermark may contain information about the owner of <b>the</b> <b>content</b> and <b>the</b> access conditions of <b>the</b> <b>content.</b> When a watermark is added to <b>the</b> <b>content,</b> it introduces distortion. But the watermark is added {{in such a way}} that <b>the</b> watermarked <b>content</b> is perceptually similar to <b>the</b> original <b>content.</b> <b>The</b> embedded watermark may be extracted using a watermark detector. Since the watermark contains information that protects <b>the</b> <b>content,</b> <b>the</b> watermarking technique should be robust, that is, the watermark signal should be difficult to remove without causing significant distortion to <b>the</b> <b>content.</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{technologies}} {{used for}} security of multimedia data include encryption, fingerprinting, and watermarking. Encryption {{can be used}} to package <b>the</b> <b>content</b> securely and force all accesses rules to <b>the</b> protected <b>content.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>content</b> is not packaged securely, <b>the</b> <b>content</b> could be easily copied. Encryption scrambles <b>the</b> <b>content</b> and renders <b>the</b> <b>content</b> unintelligible unless a decryption key is known. However, once an authorized user has decrypted <b>the</b> <b>content,</b> it does not provide any protection to <b>the</b> decrypted <b>content.</b> Encryption does not prevent an authorized user from making and distributing illegal copies. Watermarking and fingerprinting are two technologies that can provide protection to the data after it has been decrypted.|$|R

5|$|A {{document}} that purports to be a subversive document {{is presumed to}} be one until the contrary has been proved, {{and if it is}} proved that a person was carrying or had in his or her possession or under his or her control a subversive document, he or she is deemed to have known <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> of the document and their nature. Nevertheless, a person may defend himself or herself by proving that he or she was unaware of <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> and the nature of <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> of the document, and that he or she did not have reasonable cause to believe or suspect that the document was subversive. The ISA places a duty on any person, any office-bearer of an association, or any responsible member or agent of an organization who receives a subversive document to deliver it to a police officer without delay. Failure to do so without police authorization, or communicating <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> of such a document to others or publishing them is an offence.|$|E

Document analysis of <b>the</b> <b>content</b> of <b>the</b> 2010 – 2012 YGS mathematics tests and <b>the</b> <b>content</b> of 11 th- and 12 th-grade mathematics textbooks revealed that <b>the</b> <b>content</b> of these tests is 89 % to 93 % inconsistent with <b>the</b> <b>content</b> of <b>the</b> 11 th-grade mathematics textbook and 98 % to 99 % inconsistent with <b>the</b> <b>content</b> of <b>the</b> 12 th-grade mathematics textbook...|$|R

5|$|The BASIC {{interpreter}} {{was developed}} from that {{used on the}} ZX81 and a ZX81 BASIC program can be typed into a Spectrum largely unmodified, but Spectrum BASIC included many extra features {{making it easier to}} use. The ZX Spectrum character set was expanded from that of the ZX81, which did not feature lower-case letters. Spectrum BASIC included extra keywords for the more advanced display and sound, and supported multi-statement lines. The cassette interface was much more advanced, saving and loading around five times faster than the ZX81 (1500 bits per second compared to 307), and unlike the ZX81, the Spectrum could maintain the TV display during tape storage and retrieval operations. As well as being able to save programs, the Spectrum could save <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> of arrays, <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> of the screen memory, and <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> of any defined range of memory addresses.|$|E

Dark matter, a mysterious form of matter that has not yet been identified, accounts for 26.8% of <b>the</b> <b>contents.</b> Dark energy, which is the energy of empty space and is causing the expansion of the Universe to accelerate, accounts for the remaining 68.3% of <b>the</b> <b>contents.</b>|$|E
