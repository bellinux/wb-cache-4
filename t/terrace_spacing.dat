A web-based conservation planning tool for terrace layouts was created by modifying a terrace location program (TERLOC), developed originally by Sudduth and Gregory (1982) and revised by Ghidey et al. (1992). Development of a terrace system is complicated by the time-intensive manual layout process, which can take up to 50 % of the total design time. TERLOC is a conservation planning tool designed to locate terrace layouts using digital elevation data and minimal user input. arcgis enables users to automate the terrace layout procedure, potentially saving time and money in the terrace design process. Program availability and ease of use was greatly enhanced by integrating TERLOC to a web-based ArcGIS interface. Existing design procedures were modified to accommodate fields with irregular boundaries, topography, and orientation. Additional design options were also included to select a best layout design: variable <b>terrace</b> <b>spacing,</b> non-erosive channel grade, underground and interconnecting outlet selection, and the option for multiple key terraces. Analysis of the program was performed by comparing the program layout results to manually located terraces. The program and manual terrace layout results were found to be similar, especially for fields with large drainage areas. <b>Terrace</b> <b>spacing</b> was found to differ the most, with the program spacing typically larger than the manual result. Finally, the software quality of TERLOC was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. The presence of specific user and overall software requirements in TERLOC were found to increase program performance and utility...|$|E
40|$|Neste trabalho é apresentada uma tabela para espaçamento de terraços, baseada nos dados experimentais de perdas por erosão obtidos em nossos solos. Utilizando os dados das determinações de perdas por erosão obtidos nos principais tipos de solo do Estado, numa média de 10 anos de observações, em talhões de diferentes comprimentos de rampa e diferentes graus de declive, com culturas anuais, determinou-se uma equação que permite {{calcular}} as perdas médias de terra para os diferentes graus de declive e comprimentos de rampa. Considerando não só as perdas de terra e água como também o teor de terra na enxurrada, foi determinada a posição média relativa para esses três fatores, considerados conjuntamente. Os dados assim conseguidos foram estudados com relação ao grau de declive e ao comprimento de rampa, e a equação resultante foi denominada de "índice de erosão". Como o terraceamento se baseia, essencialmente, no efeito do grau de declive e do comprimento de rampa, com a equação do "índice de erosão" foi organizada uma tabela para espaçamentos de terraços. The {{purpose of}} this study is to present a <b>terrace</b> <b>spacing</b> table that may be helpful to others undertaking soil conservation extension service. The determination of soil and water losses in the São Paulo State began, about 10 years ago, with the runoff catching tanks installed on the chief soil types of the State, at some of the experiment stations of the Instituto Agronômico. Making use of the soil loss and runoff data obtained at the slope length plots and several degree slope plots planted with annual crops, an equation was determined which permits to evaluate the average of total soil loss in runoff as influenced by the degree and length of land slope. Considering the soil and water losses, and the calculated percent amount of soil in runoff, the relative average of these three factors was determined. By this way the data were studied in relation to the degree and the length of land slope and the resulting equation was named "índice de Erosão" (Erosion Index). As the terracing is based, essentially, on the effect of the degree and the slope length, with the erosion index equation a table for <b>terrace</b> <b>spacing</b> was organized. On the basis of this study the following conclusions were drawn: a) doubling the degree of slope increases the total soil loss in runoff 2. 26 times and the erosion index 1. 57 times; b) doubling the horizontal length of slope increases the total soil loss in runoff 3. 09 times and the erosion index 1. 83 times; c) the relative averages, with respect to soil loss and runoff, for sandy soil and olayish soil are larger in about 30 % and 20 %, respectively, when compared with the diabase soil ("terra roxa"); d) for practical purposes the erosion index is represented by the equation: E = 1, 03 D 0, 66 C D' 87. in which E is the erosion index, D is the degree of slope, and C is the length of slope. The equation is based updn a limited amount of data which were not developed for the {{purpose of this}} study, therefore, refinements will be necessary; e) the following formulas for <b>terrace</b> <b>spacing</b> were developed: EH = 45, 18 /D 0, 42 and EV = 0, 4518 K D 0, 58 in which EH is the horizontal interval between terraces, K is the soil type coefficient, D is the degree of land slope and EV is the vertical interval between terraces...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe rainfed {{region in}} Iraq {{comprises}} {{an area of}} more than 5 millionha of forest, grazing and farmland areas. Except the plains, the region suffers from moderate to severe water erosion due mainly to overgrazing and land mismanagement. Due to population growth and the shortage in water resources, an expansion in land used for agriculture {{in the region is}} expected. Terracing is an option when utilizing sloping land for agricultural production. A terrace design criterion was developed for the region in which <b>terrace</b> <b>spacing</b> was determined using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE); terrace channel specifications were determined using conventional hydraulic computations. Analyses showed that terracing is feasible on rolling and hilly sloping land in the high rainfall zone (seasonal rainfall > 600 mm) where economic crops are grown to offset the high cost of terrace construction and maintenance. In the medium and low rainfall zones (seasonal rainfall 400 – 600 mm and 300 – 400 mm), terracing for water erosion control is generally not needed on cultivated land less than 10 % in slope where wheat and barley crops are normally grown; however, pioneer research projects are needed to assess the feasibility of terraces of the level (detention) type to conserve rain water in these two zones for a more successful rainfed farming venture...|$|E

40|$|The {{practice}} of many countries {{has shown that}} terraces can significantly prevent land degradation processes such as excessive soil erosion, landslides. Condition is good layout, proper construction, and then proper maintenance. Practical application in many countries showed that terraces can significantly prevent processes leading to the degradation of land, such as the excessive erosion of soils and landslides. The requirement for this is well-planned, adequate construction, and later – proper conservation. In Poland {{this is a little}} popular method. In the article, the dorsal spacing terraces were calculated for two catchments – in the central and south-western parts of Poland. Meteorological and soil data were used for Puczniew station (Ner catchment) and Boleścin station (Mielnica catchment). Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was performed to assess the compatibility of a given feature with a normal distribution, then the distribution of the probability distribution was developed. For probability 1, 50 and 90 % the spacing of terraces was calculated using Ramser and Morgan method. The results obtained were combined with the results from the USLE model. Hydraulic methods have shown greater spacing for the Mielnica catchment (loess soils) compared to the Ner basin (clay loam). For the USLE model, the larger spacing was calculated for the Ner basin. From the practical application to the acceptance of land user will be the maximum distance calculated by different methods. The highest <b>terrace</b> <b>spacing</b> values were obtained using the Morgan method for the Mielnica catchment, for the Ner catchment model USLE...|$|E
40|$|Focusing on climatic- and {{structural}} (tectonic) controls, {{we aim to}} determine their relative importance for the (Pliocene to Quaternary) fluvial landscape evolution in the Southern Pyrenees foreland. We investigate the Segre River, {{which is one of}} the major streams of the Southern Pyrenees that drains the elevated chain towards the Ebro foreland basin. Along its course, the Segre River has a flight of fluvial cut-and-fill (and strath-type) terraces preserved that have been mapped based on DEM's and geomorphological fieldwork. This paper presents the first results of our study and reports on the Segre terrace staircase, which is characterized by seven major Quaternary terrace levels with elevations up to more than 110. m above the modern floodplain. At the upper and middle reaches, the semi-parallel terraces of the Segre River occasionally show anomalies featuring extensive gravel thickness and deformation caused by faulting, folding and local subsidence. The longitudinal correlations of terrace levels reveal increased vertical <b>terrace</b> <b>spacing</b> in the foreland, which could originate from enhanced fluvial erosion after the Mid-Pleistocene climate transition in combination with base level lowering controlled by the progressive downcutting of the Catalan Coastal Range. Since the Ebro Basin opening (Late Miocene), the Catalan Coastal Range, which borders the Ebro foreland basin to the Mediterranean Sea, was progressively cut down and the exorheic drainage system gradually adjusted to sea level. The Segre longitudinal terrace profiles and the Ebro gorge morphology at the Catalan Coastal Range indicate a base-level of about 200. m. s. l. at the beginning of (Pleistocene) terrace formation, which implies that the Catalan Coastal Range might have functioned as a local base-level upstream of the sea outlet, presumably until the Late Pleistocene. Alternatively, a yet unknown tectonic process might have caused base level lowering and the preservation of terrace staircases at the Ebro drainage system. © 2012 Elsevier B. V...|$|E
40|$|Gale is a 140 -km {{diameter}} {{impact crater}} {{located at the}} plateau/plain boundary in the Aeolis Northeast subquadrangle of Mars (5 S/ 223 W). The crater is bordered in the northward direction by the Elysium Basin, and in eastward direction by Hesperian channels and the Aeolis Mensae 2. The crater displays a rim with two distinct erosion stages: (a) though eroded, the south rim of Gale has an apparent crest line visible from the north to the southwest (b) the west and northwest rims are characterized by a strong erosion that, in some places, partially destroyed the rampart, leaving remnant pits embayed in smooth-like deposits. The same type of deposits is observed north, outside Gale, it also borders the Aeolis Mensae, covers {{the bottom of the}} plateau scarp, and the crater floor. The central part of Gale shows a 6400 km 2 subround and asymmetrical deposit: (a) the south part is composed of smooth material, (b) the north part shows spectacular terraces, streamlines, and channels. The transition between the two parts of the deposit is characterized by a scarp ranging from 200 to 2000 in high. The highest point of the scarp {{is at the center of}} the crater, and probably corresponds to a central peak. Gale crater does not show a major channel directly inflowing. However, several large fluvi systems are bordering the crater, and could be at the origin of the flooding of the crater, or have contributed to. One fluvial system is entering the crater by the southwest rim but cannot be accounted alone for the volume of sediment deposited in the crater. This channel erodes the crater floor deposit, and ends in a irregular-shaped and dark albedo feature. Gale crater shows the morphology of a crater filled during sedimentation episodes, and then eroded Part of the lower sediment deposition contained in Gale might be ancient and not only aqueous in origin. According to the regional geologic history, the sedimentary deposit could be a mixture of aeolian and pyroclastic material, and aqueous sedimentary material that can originate both from drainage of the regional subsurface aquifer, and/or from surface flood. The central deposit shows three main levels: (a) the current crater floor (north of Gale), (b) an ancient level about 200 rn higher (south of Gale), and (c) the massive terraced deposits. A crater statistics on the 15, 400 kM 2 area of the crater floor and deposit [3, 41 gave: 259 +/- 112. 4 craters, most of them partly embayed in the sedimentary deposit, and all inferior to 5 -km diameter. For superimposed crater population only, the result is 194 +/- 112. The deduced relative ages ranges from Early to Middle Amazonian. The population of craters are comparable for the three levels, implying that the last sedimentation/erosion episode on Gale was recent and affected the whole crater. The streamlined morphology of the border of the deposit, the layering, the channels, and the terraces are compatible with a significant fluvio-lacustrine history of the site. Multiple levels may suggest different episodes, but the common statistical age of the three levels shows that the last episode involved the whole crater. The origin of the lake water in Gale may have varied in time. Three major contributions have been proposed: (a) the drainage of the regional underground aquifer by Gale crater over an area of 110 -km radius around the crater which would have provided approximately 1, 600 cubic km of water, (b), surface drainage entering Gale by the south and north rims. In the south, a 250 -km long system originates in the cratered uplands in a Noachian crater material plain (Nc), and crosses Hesperian and Amazonian crater material plains (AHc) northward [1]. Several fluvial systems originate in the Aeolis Mensae, east of Gale. They may had two functions in time: to recharge, the underground aquifer in the region of Gale, and to supply surface water in the crater by overspilling the northern rim, and (c) surface floods that originated from the rising of the water level in the Elysium Basin. According to the Amazonian age of Gale's floor, and the erosion direction in the crater, a flood from Elysium Basin is the most likely event to explain the material observed in Gale, and the formation of the last lake. This last flood may have been important enough to flood the central deposit up to about 1400 m above the crater floor, leaving two islands (non stream lined features) at the center of the deposit. <b>Terrace</b> <b>spacing</b> suggests a regular drop of the lake level in time. Fractures in terraces perpendicular to the shoreline can be interpreted either as: (a) the result of the drainage systems during the waning of the lake, or (b) traces of the pressure of an ice-covered sheet associated with subglacial drainage. The presence of a lake of such volume during the Amazonian period is one more evidence that water was still active on Mars relatively recently. Gale crater offers the rare opportunity to unveil a key-period of the martian history. The Amazonian might proved not as cold and dry as previously thought. The presence of large lakes and basins (Elysium Basin is large as the Mediterranean Sea), reinforces the model of an extensive water activity during the Amazonian that has still to be understood in the context of an assumed cooling and drying planet. The sediments and rocks that were left of this period in Gale keep the record of the climatic conditions of the Amazonian and the clues that are missing to understand the climatic evolution of Mars. In addition, Gale crater presents the advantage to be located at the plateau/plain boundary, which has never been studied and contains information about the two main martian geological units. As a conclusion, we propose a table that summarizes the worthiness of a mission in Gale crater, and the expected science return relative to the objectives to be met by the Surveyor Program.
