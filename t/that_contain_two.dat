25|$|Rabbits live in warrens <b>that</b> <b>contain</b> <b>two</b> to 10 other {{individuals}} living in smaller groups to ensure greater breeding success. Territoriality and aggression contribute {{greatly to the}} rabbits maturation process and help ensure survival of the population. Mature male and females are better at fighting off predators. Females {{tend to be more}} territorial than males, although the areas most frequented by females are not defended. Rabbits mark their territories with dung hills. They expel soft, mucus-covered pellets that are sometimes reingested (coprophagy). They also expel larger pellets covered with secretions from the anal gland. A rabbit’s success in repelling strangers depends on the potency of the pellets. When young rabbits leave their natal warrens, they either settle in their pre-existing territories, take over unoccupied, formerly established territories, or become transients. Females tend to move into neighboring territories, while males tend to move further away.|$|E
500|$|Hawthorne Villa is a Gothic-revival two-storey red-brick {{building}} at 1 Church Street. It {{was built by}} Thomas Monds in 1875 and is surrounded by English-style gardens <b>that</b> <b>contain</b> <b>two</b> large Californian Redwoods. The Villa {{was built on the}} site of Carrick's first hotel—an Adobe Inn built in the 1830s by John Archer—using some brickwork from the former building. This former building had been vacant since 1867 and was in a poor state. [...] "The Stables" [...] is a tourist property, set in the Villa's gardens, that is used for self-contained accommodation.|$|E
500|$|The {{closely related}} vulcan elf cup (Geopyxis vulcanalis) has a pale orange to {{yellowish}} fruitbody that is deeply cup shaped before flattening in maturity, and its crushed flesh often has an odor of sulfur. It may be distinguished microscopically [...] by its paraphyses, which lack the orange-brown granules characteristic of G.carbonaria. It also has larger spores, measuring 14–22 by 8–11µm. Unlike G.carbonaria, it grows on substrates other than burned wood, including mosses, and needle duff. Tarzetta cupularis, which grows habitats similar to G.carbonaria, is distinguished microscopically by its spores <b>that</b> <b>contain</b> <b>two</b> oil droplets. Other genera with similar species with which G.carbonaria may be confused {{in the field}} include Aleuria, Caloscypha, Melastiza, and Sowerbyella.|$|E

2500|$|Cyclooxygenases (COXs): COX-1 and COX-2 {{initiate}} the metabolism of arachidonic acid to prostanoids <b>that</b> <b>contain</b> <b>two</b> double bonds, i.e. the prostaglandins (e.g. PGE2), prostacyclin (i.e. PGI2), and thromboxanes (e.g. TXA2). The two COX enzymes likewise {{initiate the}} metabolism of: a) eicosapentaenoic acid, which has 5 double bonds {{compared to the}} 4 double bonds of arachidonic acid, to prostanoid, prostacyclin, and thromboxane products that have three double bonds, e.g. PGE3, PGI3, and TXA3 and b) Dihomo-γ-linolenic acid acid, which has three double bonds, to prostanoid, prostacyclin, and thromboxane products that have only one double bond, e.g. PGE1, PGI1, and TXA1.|$|E
2500|$|ALOX15 and Alox15 enzymes are non-heme, iron-containing dioxygenases. [...] They {{commonly}} catalyze {{the attachment}} of molecular oxygen [...] as a peroxy residue to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) <b>that</b> <b>contain</b> <b>two</b> carbon-carbon double bonds {{that for the}} human ALOX15 are located between carbons 10 and 9 and 7 and 6 as numbered counting backward from the last or omega (i.e. ω) carbon at the methyl end of the PUFA (these carbons are also termed ω-10 and ω-9 and ω-7 and ω-6). [...] In PUFAs {{that do not have}} a third carbon-carbon double bound between their ω-13 and ω-12 carbons, human ALOX15 forms ω-6 peroxy intermediates; in PUFAs that do have this third double bound, human ALOX15 makes the ω-6 peroxy intermediate but also small amounts of the ω-9 peroxy intermediate. Rodent Alox15 enzymes, in contrast, produce almost exclusively ω-9 peroxy intermediates. Concurrently, ALOX15 and rodent Alox15 enzymes rearrange the carbon-carbon double bonds to bring them into the 1S-hydroxy-2E,4Z-diene configuration. ALOX15 and Alox15 enzymes act {{with a high degree of}} Stereospecificity to form products that position the hydroperoxy residue in the S stereoisomer configuration.|$|E
