25|$|On 3 February 1962 her {{conversion}} {{was completed}} to an Advance Aviation Base Ship (one of two ships of the steam-powered LST-1153-class) and redesignated USS Tallahatchie County (AVB-2.) Her aft superstructure was extended forward and her forecastle built up; electronic antennas {{and a heavy}} king post were mounted amidships. As an AVB, Tallahatchie County was designed to provide command and logistic facilities to a squadron of P-2 Neptune or P-3 Orion antisubmarine patrol planes operating from an improvised land base in Souda Bay, Crete. Squadron equipment was carried in mobile vans, transported in Tallahatchie County's <b>tank</b> <b>deck,</b> and landed over her bow ramp.|$|E

2500|$|As an ex-LST, Phaon had heavier armament, greater deck {{facilities}} for cargo handling, {{and a much}} longer superstructure deck, though {{in this case the}} <b>tank</b> <b>deck</b> was covered with lathes, grinders, drills, metal cutters, welding machines and other shop equipment not found on an LST.|$|E
2500|$|Misoa was one {{of three}} shallow-draught oil tankers built by the Furness Shipbuilding Company of Haverton Hill-on-Tees in 1937 to operate in Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela. She was requisitioned by the Royal Navy in December 1940, along with her sister ships Tasajera and Bachaquero, for {{conversion}} to a tank landing ship. Her oil tanks were removed to form a <b>tank</b> <b>deck,</b> and two large hatches and two 50-ton derrick cranes fitted to lift vehicles from the <b>tank</b> <b>deck</b> to the upper deck. Her bows were cut off square and a heavy steel door fitted. A hinged extension, together with the door, provided a [...] ramp to unload vehicles. Steel armour plate was fitted to the bridge and wheelhouse, and the ship was armed with a single 40mm gun, six 20mm anti-aircraft guns, three Lewis machine guns, and a smoke mortar. There was accommodation for up to 217 troops, and for a crew of 98. She could carry eighteen 30-ton tanks, or twenty-two 25-ton tanks, or 33 heavy trucks. After refitting was complete she was commissioned in August 1941.|$|E
2500|$|Amphibious {{assaults on}} Japanese-held {{islands in the}} South and Southwest Pacific Theater had {{involved}} virtually hundreds of landing craft of all types and sizes, ranging from small craft to infantry landing craft (LCIs) and tank landing craft (LCTs). Since these specialized assault craft, of comparatively light construction, could not be repaired with the few facilities and men available to them alone, orders went out that several tank landing ships (LSTs) would be converted to special landing craft repair ships (later classified as ARL). However, modifying existing LSTs in stateside yards required time, a critical commodity in the fairly steady pace of the amphibious island-hopping campaigns, that the forces fighting at the front did not have. At this point, LST-455, then in Australian waters, came under the gaze of these amphibious planners. In one month, lathes, welding machines, as well as cutting outfits and repair tools for the necessary types of craft, were installed on board. Departmental shops of many kinds: ranging from machine shops to motor repair work, to shipfitting, to metalsmith, to electric, and radio repair, took shape in {{what had once been}} the cavernous <b>tank</b> <b>deck.</b> Experienced personnel, trained in ship repair work, were assigned to the ship and almost doubled the size of her complement. Experienced personnel, trained in ship repair work, were assigned to the ship and almost doubled the size of her complement. Ready for service by the latter part of May 1943, the former tank landing ship departed Australian waters, bound for New Guinea, and arrived at Milne Bay on 2 June 1943. She immediately commenced the work for which she had been converted, repairing LCIs under the guidance of the repair officer of [...]|$|E
50|$|UTM is {{frequently}} {{used to monitor}} steel thickness in various places of ships and offshore constructions. Surveyors equipped with portable UTM probes reach steel plating in sides, <b>tanks,</b> <b>decks</b> and the superstructure. They can read its thickness by simply touching the steel with the measurement head. Contact is usually assured by first removing visible corrosion scale and then applying petroleum jelly before pressing the probe against metal. It is also used for monitoring pipelines.|$|R
50|$|Early in April, while {{preparing}} for shakedown, the ship tested {{a new concept}} for her class by hoisting a major self-contained medical unit (MUST) on her <b>tank</b> <b>decks.</b> This was done to evaluate the feasibility of setting up complete hospital facilities on her deck after off-loading her troops, vehicles, and cargo. She got underway on 19 April for Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, for shakedown, which lasted until her return to Little Creek on 8 June. Various types of training and post-shakedown availability kept her busy {{through the end of}} the year.|$|R

5|$|A {{series of}} {{meetings}} involving Wooten, Barbey, Edmund Herring (Wooten's superior as commander of I Corps), Colonel Merian C. Cooper from the Fifth Air Force, and Air Commodore Joe Hewitt from the RAAF, reached agreement, or at least compromise, on many points. Wooten wanted at least 10 days' reserve rations. This meant that some stores {{would have to be}} transported in bulk, and not pre-loaded on trucks as Barbey initially wanted. Loading the stores onto trucks was an inefficient use of shipping space, but permitted quick unloading of the LSTs, as the trucks could simply be driven off. The 9th Division did not have sufficient trucks for this, but 200 trucks earmarked for the US Advanced Base at Lae were borrowed from USASOS. Barbey would not allow loaded vehicles on the <b>tank</b> <b>decks</b> of the LSTs, as this was a fire hazard, so bulk stores were carried there instead.|$|R
50|$|UTM is {{frequently}} {{used to monitor}} metal thickness or weld quality in industrial settings. NDE Technicians equipped with portable UTM probes reach steel plating in sides, <b>tanks,</b> <b>decks</b> and the superstructure. They can read its thickness by simply touching the steel with the measurement head (transducer). Contact is usually assured by first removing visible corrosion scale and then applying petroleum jelly or another couplant before pressing the probe against metal. However, when UTM is used with an Electromagnetic Acoustic Transducer (EMAT) the use of couplant is not required. These testing methods are used to inspect metal to determine quality and safety without destroying or compromising its integrity. It is a requirement of many classification societies The techniques and technologies associated with UTM {{are closely related to}} the use of ultrasound in other contexts, such as the various other industrial ultrasonic measurements, as well as medical ultrasonography and preclinical imaging micro-ultrasound.|$|R

5000|$|Her {{modified}} <b>tank</b> <b>deck</b> refitted and {{housed a}} complete and fixed hospital facility which extended into the ship through new water tight doors on port and starboard sides of the <b>tank</b> <b>deck.</b> The <b>tank</b> <b>deck,</b> now hospital, bolstered a receiving or triage area, 78 hospital beds and accommodations (washrooms, toilets, increased galley), refrigerators, and a surgical suite. The ship was equipped with specialist consultation and out-patient care at all times, including: radiology, pharmacy, laboratory, eye refractions, dental care, a blood bank, and stores for 25 tons of medical supplies. Staff was increased to 6 physicians, one dentist and a complement of corpsmen. During Normandy most LSTs had one or two Corpsmen. Above deck she looked as any other LST and because of her armament she was not considered as a hospital ship {{in compliance with the}} Geneva Convention.|$|E

The tanks may be fitted on, below or partly below deck and be both longitudinally and transversely located. Lobe-type tanks are commonly used at the forward end of the ship, to improve the poor utilization of the hull volume. This containment system is used for LPG, Ethylene and small scale LNG carriers. The material, if used {{for the construction of}} tanks designed to carry ethylene, is 5% nickel steel. The maximum Allowable relief vapour setting (MARVS) is > 0. 7 bar.|$|R
