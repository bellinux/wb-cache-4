5|$|Alexander {{proceeded}} to {{take possession of}} Syria, {{and most of the}} coast of the Levant. In the following year, 332BC, he was forced to attack Tyre, which he captured after a long and difficult siege. The men of military age were massacred and <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> sold into slavery.|$|E
5|$|On 23 February 1852, Birkenhead docked {{briefly at}} Simonstown, near Cape Town. Most of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> disembarked {{along with a}} number of sick soldiers. Nine cavalry horses, several bales of hay and 35tons of coal were loaded for the last leg of the voyage to Algoa Bay.|$|E

5|$|The men – {{numbering}} between 400 and 900 – {{were bound}} and {{placed under the}} custody of Muhammad ibn Maslamah, while <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> were placed under Abdullah ibn Salam, a former rabbi who had converted to Islam.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, most of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> had {{gathered}} in the sacristy of the church. As Mexican soldiers entered the room, a boy, {{thought to be the}} son of defender Anthony Wolf, stood up to rearrange a blanket around his shoulders. Mistaking him for a Texian soldier, the Mexican soldiers bayoneted him. In the confusion, {{at least one of the}} women was lightly wounded. Bowie's family, including Gertrudis Navarro, Juana Navarro Alsbury and her son, were hiding in one of the rooms along the west wall. Navarro opened the door to their room to signal that they meant no harm. A Mexican officer soon arrived and led the women to a spot along one of the walls where they would be relatively safe. All of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> were eventually placed under the protection of an officer and escorted out of the Alamo and imprisoned in the home of the Musquiz family.|$|E
5|$|Himmler {{notified}} Fegelein by telegram on 1 August {{that the}} numbers killed were far too low. A few days later, Himmler issued regimental order no. 42, which called for all male Jews {{over the age of}} 14 to be killed. <b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> were to be driven into the swamps and drowned. Thus Fegelein's units were among the first in the Holocaust to wipe out entire Jewish communities. As the water in the swamps was too shallow and some areas had no swamps, it proved impractical to drown <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children,</b> so they were shot. Fegelein's final report on the operation, dated 18 September 1941, states that they killed 14,178 Jews, 1,001 partisans, 699 Red Army soldiers, with 830 prisoners taken and losses of 17 dead, 36 wounded, and 3 missing. The historian Henning Pieper estimates the actual number of Jews killed was closer to 23,700.|$|E

50|$|The {{medical clinic}} {{was built to}} provide {{treatment}} to <b>the</b> diseased <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children.</b> There is a full-time doctor {{with a team of}} girls to look after <b>the</b> suffering <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children.</b>|$|R
5|$|She was wrecked on 26 February 1852, while {{transporting}} {{troops to}} Algoa Bay at Danger Point near Gansbaai, 87 miles (140 kilometres) from Cape Town, South Africa. There {{were not enough}} serviceable lifeboats for all the passengers, and the soldiers famously stood firm on board, thereby allowing <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> to board the boats safely and escape the sinking.|$|E
5|$|The rebels {{moved into}} Magomero {{in the early}} evening, while Livingstone {{and his wife were}} {{entertaining}} some dinner guests. The estate official, Duncan MacCormick, was in another house nearby. A third building, occupied by Emily Stanton, Alyce Roach and five children, contained a small cache of weapons and ammunition belonging to the local rifle club. The insurgents quietly broke into the Livingstone's house and injured him during hand-to-hand fighting, prompting him to take refuge in the bedroom, where his wife attempted to treat his wounds. The rebels forced their way into the bedroom, and after capturing his wife, decapitated Livingstone. MacCormick, who had been alerted, was killed by a rebel spear. The attackers took <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> of the village prisoner but shortly released them unhurt, having reportedly treated them well. It has been suggested that Chilembwe may have hoped to use <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> as hostages, but this remains unclear. The attack on Magomero, and in particular the killing of Livingstone, had great symbolic significance for Chilembwe's men. The two Mauser rifles captured from the plantation formed the basis of the rebel armoury {{for the rest of the}} uprising.|$|E
5|$|When the {{interior}} wall fell, the men, true to their promise, {{sprang from the}} ruins and fought with great courage, forcing Philip to send his troops forward in relays to the front line. By nightfall the Macedonians retreated to camp. That night the Abydenians resolved to save <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> and at daybreak they sent some priests and priestess with a garland across to the Macedonians, surrendering the city to Philip.|$|E
50|$|While {{midwives}} did {{not typically}} offer prenatal care, postnatal care was more common. Midwives sometimes {{stayed in the}} house to care for <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>child,</b> especially if <b>the</b> delivery had been a difficult one.|$|R
25|$|The 1950 {{exhibition}} had {{sections on}} Antique Arts in Modern Life, Today's Home, the Cité 50, Rural Domestic Arts, Kitchen Furnishings, Collective Living, Food, Wine, Furniture, The Room of <b>the</b> <b>Woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>Child,</b> Cleaning Products <b>and</b> Home Appliances.|$|R
5000|$|A {{few days}} later, Nunzio {{and his friends}} <b>and</b> family, {{including}} <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> he saved from the building, assemble on their building's stoop to pose for a photograph, holding the newspaper headline that describes him as [...] "Superman." ...|$|R
5|$|A second {{emigrant}} ship—the Kennersley Castle, a merchantman docked at Leith, near Edinburgh—was {{hired by}} MacGregor in October 1822, and left Leith on 22 January 1823 with almost 200 emigrants aboard. MacGregor again saw the settlers off, coming aboard {{to see that}} they were well quartered; to their delight, he announced that since this was the maiden emigrant voyage from Scotland to Poyais, all <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> would sail free of charge. The Cazique was rowed back to shore to rousing cheers from his colonists. The ship's captain Henry Crouch fired a six-gun broadside salute, hoisted the supposed flag of Poyais, then steered the ship out of port.|$|E
5|$|A second {{strategy}} was therefore suggested to the Allies by Themistocles. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) {{would require the}} army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Allies, despite the overwhelming number of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the allied navy could block the straits of Artemisium. This dual {{strategy was}} adopted by the congress. However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should it come to it, while <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> of Athens were evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.|$|E
5|$|About 60 Gilbertese {{civilians were}} {{relocated}} to Fanning island in January 1957 on the copra ship Tungaru, and another 40 on the Tulgai the following month. By mid-March 44 Gilbertese men, 29 women and 56 children remained. By {{the end of}} April, 31 of the men, and all <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> hadd been taken to Fanning Island by RAF Hastings. The civilians would remain there {{for the next three}} months, before returning to Christmas Island. During the later test series, the Gilbertese civilians remained on the island, marshalled in areas like the military personnel.|$|E

40|$|A poem {{praising the}} Norwegians for defying the Nazis in World War II. The {{text of the}} poem is framed by a {{painting}} depicting a blond-haired man, <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>child.</b> <b>The</b> man wears overalls <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> wear kerchiefs on their heads. The man is holding a pitchfork. In the background are a haystack and a traditional Norwegian loft house...|$|R
5|$|After the Roman {{victory at}} Mount Olympus, the Tectosagi begged {{them not to}} attack them and asked to meet him for a conference halfway between their camp and Ancyra. The main aim of the conference was for the Tectosagi to delay the Roman attack {{so that they could}} allow <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> to retreat across the Halys River. Their other aim was to assassinate Manlius while he was at the conference. While they were going to the conference the Romans saw the Galatian cavalry {{charging}} at them. In the skirmish that followed the Galatians overpowered Manlius' bodyguard due to their numbers but were driven back when the escort that had been accompanying the Roman foragers arrived and forced the Galatians to retreat.|$|E
5|$|At night, A Syrian force {{attempted}} to surround the Israelis by crossing the Jordan River {{to the north}} of the Sea of Galilee, but encountered a minefield in which a senior Syrian officer was wounded. This was spotted and reported by the Israelis at Tabgha, and the additional reprieve allowed the Kinarot Valley villages to evacuate the children, elderly and sick, as well as conduct maneuvers which feigned massive reinforcements in the Poria-Alumot region. In the panic of surprise, many men also tried to flee the frontal villages, but blockposts were set up near Afula and Yavne'el by the Military Police Service's northern command, under Yosef Pressman, who personally stopped buses and allowed only <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> to proceed to safety.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the siege}} began, Skanderbeg exited Krujë with 8,000 men—among whom were many Slavs, Italians, Frenchmen and Germans. 2,000 {{of these were}} {{infantry}} and 6,000 were cavalry. Skanderbeg found Mount Tumenishta (now known as Mount Skënderbeu) to be a suitable position from which to attack the Ottomans. Krujë was left with a garrison of 4,000 men {{under the command of}} Vrana Konti. Vrana had under his command several Germans, Italians, and Frenchmen, to whom he emphasized the importance of the siege and also ordered them to their positions. Krujë had enough supplies for a sixteen-month siege. <b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> of Krujë were sent for protection to Venetian possessed cities, whereas the others were ordered to burn their crops and move into the mountains and fortresses.|$|E
50|$|During the {{hostilities}} many settlers {{had taken}} refuge at Fort Steilacoom, <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> being left there, {{while the men}} enrolled in the volunteers. Ezar Meeker, one of the settlers, paid the following tribute to First Lieutenant John Nugen of the Fourth Infantry, commanding Fort Steilacoom while Captain Maloney was in the field.|$|R
5000|$|The North Wind is a {{painting}} by Australian painter Frederick McCubbin, {{thought to have been}} painted in around 1888. The painting depicts a young family - <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> in a dray, the man and a dog on foot - making [...] "its way down a bush track, buffeted by the treacherous ‘north wind’".|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Stephen," [...] I {{said when}} Hans had gone and I had {{explained}} everything, [...] "there are two courses open to us. Either {{we can try}} to give these gentlemen the slip at once, in which case we must leave <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> to their fate, or we can stop where we are and wait to be attacked." ...|$|R
5|$|Blackfish {{wanted to}} {{continue}} to Boonesborough and capture it, since it was now poorly defended, but Boone convinced him that <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> were not hardy enough to survive a winter trek. Instead, Boone promised that Boonesborough would surrender willingly to the Shawnees the following spring. Boone {{did not have an}} opportunity to tell his men that he was bluffing to prevent an immediate attack on Boonesborough, however. Boone pursued this strategy so convincingly that many of his men concluded that he had switched his loyalty to the British.|$|E
5|$|Following some fruitless negotiations, <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> {{were allowed}} to leave the house, and then both sides began firing. After about an hour, McFarlane called a ceasefire; {{according}} to some, a white flag had been waved in the house. As McFarlane stepped into the open, a shot rang out from the house, and he fell mortally wounded. The enraged rebels then {{set fire to the}} house, including the slave quarters, and Kirkpatrick surrendered. The number of casualties at Bower Hill is unclear; McFarlane and one or two other militiamen were killed; one U.S. soldier may have died from wounds received in the fight. The rebels sent the U.S. soldiers away. Kirkpatrick, Lenox, and Presley Neville were kept as prisoners, but they later escaped.|$|E
5|$|Menominees from Green Bay, who had mobilized a {{battalion}} of nearly 300 men, arrived {{too late for the}} battle. They were upset at having missed the chance to fight their old enemies, and so on August 10, General Scott sent 100 of them after a part of the British Band that had escaped. Indian agent Samuel C. Stambaugh, who accompanied them, urged the Menominees not to take any scalps, but Chief Grizzly Bear insisted that such a prohibition could not be enforced. The group tracked down about ten Sauks, only two of whom were warriors. The Menominees killed and scalped the warriors, but spared <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children.</b>|$|E

In the background, a chateau can be seen foggily across the lake, which casts its reflection in the water...|$|R
25|$|Other {{information}} {{also shows}} <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> lived {{together in the}} Northeastern United States between two weeks and three months before their deaths. Investigators have also concluded <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> two of <b>the</b> <b>children</b> lived {{in the area where}} their bodies were found. Advanced forensic testing showed the 2-to-4-year-old girl (Rasmussen's daughter) probably spent most of her childhood in either the upper Northeast or upper Midwest.|$|R
