50|$|In operation, the torpedo's {{operator}} {{would be}} positioned on a 40 ft high <b>telescopic</b> <b>steel</b> tower, {{which could be}} extended hydraulically. He was provided with a special pair of binoculars on which were mounted controls {{which could be used}} to electrically control the relative speeds of the twin winding engines. In this way he was able to follow the track of the torpedo and steer it with a great degree of accuracy. In tests carried out by the Admiralty the operator was able to hit a floating object at 2000 yd and was able to turn the torpedo through 180 degrees to hit a target from the off side.|$|R

25|$|The climate was estranged until Scottish {{businessman}} Sir Thomas Lipton {{became the}} financial backer for the Royal Ulster Yacht Club's 1899 challenge. William Fife {{was chosen to}} design the challenging yacht because of past success in American waters. The yachts increased yet again in size, and this time Herreshoff fitted a <b>telescopic</b> <b>steel</b> mast to his defender Columbia, but his largest contribution was to recruit Scottish-American skipper Charlie Barr. The latter had helmed Fife designs in Yankee waters before, and he had shown perfect coordination with his hand-picked Scandinavian crew. Barr successfully helmed Columbia to victory, and Lipton's noted fair play provided unprecedented popular appeal to the sport and to his tea brand.|$|R
5000|$|One of Fabro’s first pieces {{was called}} Tubo da mettere tra i fiori (Tube to place among flowers), 1963. It was a {{site-specific}} installation {{designed for a}} Milanese garden, {{even if it was}} never displayed there; it was made of <b>telescopic</b> <b>steel</b> tubes. He made several works that deals with steel tubes in dialogue with basic physical laws of nature. [...] In 1965(Milan, Galleria Vismara), he had his first solo show where he combined mirror pieces with spatial lines. Since 1966, he began to make performative works such as Indumenti: posaseni, calzari, bandoliera (Garments: bra, boots, cross-belt), 1966; Allestimento Teatrale( [...] Cube di specchi) Theatrical Staging( [...] Cube of Mirrors), 1967-1975; and Pavimento/Tautologia (Floor/ Tautology), 1967.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The hot ring {{compression}} test of chrome <b>steel</b> <b>covered</b> with an oxide scale film {{is carried out}} {{to examine the effects}} of the oxide scale film on the hot forging characteristics. For changing the chemical compositions of the oxide scale, the oxide scale film is generated at air or steam atmosphere. The nominal coefficient of shear friction of the chrome <b>steel</b> <b>covered</b> with the oxide scale film is estimated from the plastic deformation behavior during the {{ring compression}} test. The estimated coefficient of shear friction of the chrome <b>steel</b> <b>covered</b> with the oxide scale film is found to be lower than that of the chrome steel without the oxide scale film. Furthermore, the oxide scale generated at steam atmosphere provides lower friction characteristics in comparison with the oxide scale generated at air atmosphere. The mechanism of the reduction of friction with the oxide scale is discussed...|$|R

5000|$|Using the Radio Amateur's Handbook {{as their}} guide {{and also with}} surplus parts bought from Raon in Quiapo, Manila, they built their own 500-watt AM {{transmitter}} with the assistance from Far East Broadcasting Company engineers, American Dick Rowland and Byrd Bruneimer. The transmitter was transported to Mindanao aboard the boat MV Snug Hitch. With only a <b>telescopic</b> <b>steel</b> pole as antenna borrowed from the Bureau of Telecom, the improvised horizontal radio antenna was mounted by the team which include Ongkoy Padero, former vice president for engineering of CEPALCO, attaching {{one end of a}} copper wire to the pole and the other end to a 30 meters coconut tree a block away [...] While their first “transmitter building” was financed with a P5,000 “duck farm” loan from the Philippine National Bank. The Radio Control Office (RCO) headed by Mr Jose Viado, assigned the station a broadcast frequency of 1560 kHz.|$|R
40|$|This study {{experimentally}} {{investigates the}} seismic behavior of precast reinforced concrete walls by test of large-scale specimens. The parameters of connected <b>steel</b> <b>cover</b> plate, orientation of wall reinforcements, steel ratio of wall, {{and strength of}} concrete were studied. The {{results show that the}} precast reinforced concrete wall can effectively increase the earthquake resistance of structures and protect the structural frame. The performance of the precast reinforced concrete wall can be fully developed by using connected <b>steel</b> <b>cover</b> plates with two channel plates which were fixed by M 16 chemical anchors. The modified conventional reinforcement with more steel at the corners produces better performance than the other orientations. The larger steel ratio and stronger concrete also definitely increase the earthquake resistance of structures...|$|R
