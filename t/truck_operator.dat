2500|$|Evans later {{asserted}} that the tow truck was a ruse. He claimed police snipers were already {{in the area and}} targeting him and his followers for assassination. These snipers fired on Evans and his followers first, he said. He claimed he was nowhere near the tow truck when shots were fired. [...] Instead, he said, he had left his home and was walking on west on Auburndale Avenue toward the Lakeview Tavern (a few feet around the corner to the south) when he heard shots [...] "coming {{from the end of the}} street". A man ran past him. Evans said he ran north to Beulah in time to see the tow <b>truck</b> <b>operator</b> running toward E. 123rd Street. He said he heard submachine gun fire, and said he assumed this was the blast which killed Leroy Mansfield Williams. Evans admitted that he fired several shots from his carbine, but the weapon then jammed. He fled into the home at 1384 Lakeview Road.|$|E

50|$|While helpful formal {{training}} in electronics {{is not required to}} be a satellite <b>truck</b> <b>operator</b> in fact even camera persons have made the transition from photography to transmission. What is required is a clear understanding of the operation of each device on the truck and at what point in the transmission flow it is used. Most modern day electronic equipment is too complicated to repair especially in the field. A <b>truck</b> <b>operator</b> however is expected to be able to quickly identify a defective device and either replace it or engineer a way around it. It is for this reason a strong transmission flow understanding is essential.|$|E

5000|$|A famous case, MBank El Paso v. Sanchez 836 S.W.2d 151 (Tex. 1992). {{was heard}} by the Texas Supreme Court. Sanchez was the {{registered}} owner of a vehicle which MBank El Paso was lienholder. When a tow <b>truck</b> <b>operator</b> hired by the bank attempted to repossess the vehicle, Sanchez locked herself in the car. The tow <b>truck</b> <b>operator</b> hooked the car up to the tow truck anyway, and proceeded to drive it, with Sanchez still in the vehicle, at high speed to the lot where it was left, protected by a junkyard dog. It required the combined efforts of Sanchez' boyfriend and the police {{to allow her to}} escape the impound lot. In a subsequent trial, the repossession was declared unlawful and reversed, and the bank was also held liable for $1,250,000 in damages to Sanchez, even though the unlawful eviction was taken by the tow <b>truck</b> <b>operator,</b> who was not an employee of the bank. The bank was held to a [...] "non-delegatable duty not to breach the peace," [...] and that any breach of the peace - whether by the debtor, the creditor, or even an independent contractor merely acting on behalf of the creditor - is considered the fault of the creditor.|$|E
