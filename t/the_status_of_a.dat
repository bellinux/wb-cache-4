5|$|An unusual slapstick mix of film noir, black {{comedy and}} B-movie conventions, the film portrays bizarre {{situations}} involving a death row inmate. The film was a box-office flop, {{and has since}} fallen into obscurity outside of fans of Campbell and Raimi.

Several elements of the film influenced later productions by Raimi, {{and the failure of}} Crimewave directly led to the inception of Evil Dead II (1987). The film has achieved <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minor cult film.|$|E

5|$|Dhumavati is {{described}} as a giver of siddhis (supernatural powers), a rescuer from all troubles, and a granter of all desires and rewards, including ultimate knowledge and moksha (salvation).

Dhumavati's worship is considered ideal for unpaired members of society, such as bachelors, widows, and world renouncers as well as Tantrikas. In her Varanasi temple, however, she transcends her inauspiciousness and acquires <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> local protective deity. There, even married couples worship her. Although she has very few dedicated temples, her worship by Tantric ritual continues in private in secluded places like cremation grounds and forests.|$|E
