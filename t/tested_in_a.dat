5|$|Due {{to their}} {{location}} near the beachfront, the station roof's solar panels {{needed to meet}} stringent hurricane standards, and as such, the panels for the station were rigorously <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> laboratory in York, Pennsylvania. It is the New York City Subway's first solar-powered subway station. The solar panels are expected to last for at least 35 years, and a catwalk is located below the roof if any solar panel replacements were ever needed. As a bonus feature, a low voltage current, which is emitted from the panels, serves as a deterrent against pigeons.|$|E
5|$|Multiplayer {{comes in}} two forms in Empire: Total War. As with {{previous}} Total War titles, players {{can engage in}} real-time battles against each other either by composing their armies themselves, or re-enacting battles from history. The full campaign multiplayer mode was unveiled {{one month after the}} initial release, because the technology to create a multiplayer campaign game was not available in previous Total War games, and the time allowed The Creative Assembly to implement this for Empire: Total War. The campaign multiplayer mode was first <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> two-player beta build which was released on 7 December 2009.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{building}} was a crane for ironware handling. When the frames were taken in, they were fitted with suspension and axles, and then turned the right way up. The next parts were the engine and transmission components. The final part for lorries was a pre-assembled cabin. Conventional bus chassis were delivered with bonnet and wings, but the forward control types left the factory without any body parts. After being painted, the vehicles left the assembly hall. Finally, every vehicle was tested on a -long test run on different roads and with various loads. The bus chassis were <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> similar way; because there was no body, the drivers only had warm clothes and driving goggles to protect them against the weather conditions. The vehicles were handed over to the customers after final adjustments.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City manager Joe Mercer {{named his}} {{team for the}} final several days in advance. Glyn Pardoe missed {{training}} on Monday 21st with a leg injury, but after the fitness of Pardoe, Tony Coleman and Alan Oakes was <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> practice match, all three were passed fit. Leicester City named a 14-man squad before travelling to a training camp in Bisham on the Tuesday. Manchester City travelled south on the Thursday, staying in Weybridge. Leicester had fitness doubts over Dave Gibson, Len Glover and John Sjoberg, but initially expected all three to be available for the final. However, in a practice match against Brentford, Sjoberg {{had to leave the}} field with a groin injury. His place in the team was taken by Alan Woollett.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} programme {{moved to the}} University of Exeter in 1982, where the C1 chassis was fitted with fibreglass shells and <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wind tunnel. It was recognised {{at an early stage}} that the vehicle would have to be aerodynamic; although it was only ever intended to be small and relatively slow, reducing wind resistance was seen as essential for the vehicle's efficiency. By March 1982 the basic design of the C1 had been established. Sinclair then turned to an established motor design company, Ogle Design of Letchworth, to provide professional styling assistance and production engineering. However, Ogle's approach was not to Sinclair's liking; they tackled the project as one of car design and focused more (and expensively) on the aerodynamics rather than the cycle technology around which the C1 was based. The weight of the vehicle increased to over , far more than Sinclair's desired specification. By March 1983, Sinclair and Wood Rogers had decided to stop the C1 programme. Wood Rogers comments that Ogle were convinced that the C1 would be a flop, telling Sinclair {{that it would not be}} fast enough, that its drivers would get wet when it rained and that the battery was not good enough.|$|E
