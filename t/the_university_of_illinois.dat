5|$|Erected at {{the behest}} of the Illinois General Assembly, <b>the</b> <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Illinois</b> Observatory became {{important}} in the development of astronomy due, in large part, to pioneering research by Dr. Stebbins, from 1907 to 1922. Joel Stebbins left <b>the</b> <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Illinois</b> in 1922 but left behind a legacy of discovery that helped alter the face of modern astronomy. The building served <b>the</b> <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Illinois</b> astronomy department from its opening until 1979, when the department moved into a new, larger building to house its growing staff.|$|E

5|$|Astronomy {{classes at}} <b>the</b> <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Illinois</b> date to its {{earliest}} days. The first courses focused on {{measurement of the}} night sky and was taken by civil engineering students to sharpen their surveying skills. A small observatory consisting of a 4-inch refractor and a small transit telescope was constructed by 1872. The astronomy courses were typically taught by the mathematics department and by the early 1890s, several mathematics instructors wanted to do more with astronomy. An expanded astronomy curriculum would require a new larger facility. The Illinois state legislature voted in 1895 to fund a new teaching observatory at <b>the</b> <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Illinois,</b> providing $15,000 for construction. The site chosen was a grass knoll between Matthews Avenue and Burrill Avenue, just north of the Morrow Plots, a National Historic Landmark that is the nation's oldest experimental field. Contracts were extended to Charles A. Gunn, the architect and an instructor on campus, and Bevis and Company in Urbana as the general contractor with construction beginning in April 1896. The building was completed by August at a total cost of $6,800. The principle telescope was installed in November and the final telescope was in place by February 1897.|$|E
