5|$|The Cold War and its {{events have}} left a {{significant}} legacy. It {{is often referred to}} in popular culture, especially in media featuring themes of espionage (e.g., the internationally successful James Bond movie franchise) and the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> warfare.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasingly}} unpopular war in Korea dragged on, and the Truman {{administration was}} beset {{with a series}} of corruption scandals. He eventually decided not to run for re-election. Adlai Stevenson, the Democratic candidate in the 1952 presidential election, attempted to distance himself from the President as much as possible. The election was won by the Republican candidate, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose administration ramped up the pressure on the Chinese in Korea with conventional bombing and renewed threats of using nuclear weapons. Coupled with a more favorable international political climate {{in the wake of the}} death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, this led the Chinese and North Koreans to agree to terms. The belief that the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons played an important part in the outcome would lead to their threatened use against China on a number of occasions during the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In World War II, {{the bomber}} mafia's {{theory of the}} primacy of unescorted {{daylight}} strategic bombing was proved wrong. Fleets of heavy bombers {{were not able to}} achieve victory without the cooperation of the Army and Navy, and required the protection of long-range fighters for deep penetration missions. Overall casualties in the war were not minimal, and victory did not come significantly quicker. Precision in bombing was not achieved until long-range fighter escorts became available and air superiority was achieved, as opponents had warned. The strategic bombing concept, however, was {{a major factor in the}} eventual victory and became the first core doctrine of the independent United States Air Force. Its proponents continued to promote the doctrine into the nuclear age, forming the Strategic Air Command to carry out a vision modified to fit the needs of the Cold War and the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> warfare. The bomber mafia was gradually replaced in the 1950s and 1960s by advocates of intercontinental ballistic missile warfare.|$|E

25|$|The {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in 1991 essentially ended the Cold War. However, {{the end of the}} Cold War failed to end the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapon use, although global fears of nuclear war reduced substantially. In a major move of symbolic de-escalation, Boris Yeltsin, on January 26, 1992, announced that Russia planned to stop targeting United States cities with nuclear weapons.|$|E

25|$|Despite its {{failures}} in practice, the strategic bombing concept of targeting crucial industrial bottlenecks became in 1947 the first core {{doctrine of the}} independent United States Air Force.

25|$|The Cold War and the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> {{holocaust}} {{are major}} themes introduced in Rod Serling's original Planet of the Apes script. The films are apocalyptic and dystopian, and portray the era's tensions leading to world destruction. The films critique {{both sides of}} the war, with the oppressive ape society and the mutant city featuring traits of both Western culture and the Soviet bloc. According to Greene, Cold War themes were central to the first two films and some spinoff media, but were less significant in the later sequels, which foregrounded racial conflict instead.|$|E

Lee has also compared Hulk to the Golem of Jewish mythology. In The Science of Superheroes, Gresh and Weinberg see the Hulk as a reaction to the Cold War and the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> attack, an interpretation shared by Weinstein in Up, Up and Oy Vey. This interpretation corresponds with other popularized fictional media created during this time period, which took advantage of the prevailing sense among Americans that nuclear power could produce monsters and mutants.|$|E
5000|$|The International Court of Justice gave an {{advisory}} opinion in July 1996 on the Legality <b>of</b> the <b>Threat</b> Or Use <b>Of</b> <b>Nuclear</b> Weapons.

[...] However, by a split vote, it also found that [...] "the <b>threat</b> or use <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons would generally be contrary {{to the rules of}} international law applicable in armed conflict." [...] The Court stated that it could not definitively conclude whether the <b>threat</b> or use <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons would be lawful or unlawful in an extreme circumstance of self-defense, in which the very survival of the state would be at stake.|$|R

25|$|The Peacekeeper Rail Garrison is {{a mobile}} missile {{system that was}} {{developed}} by the United States Air Force during the 1980s as part of a plan to place fifty MGM-118A Peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missiles on the rail network of the United States. The railcars were intended, in case of increased <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> war, to be deployed onto the nation's rail network to avoid being destroyed by a first strike counterforce attack by the Soviet Union. However the plan was cancelled as part of defense cutbacks following the end of the Cold War, and the Peacekeeper missiles were installed in silo launchers as LGM-118s instead.|$|E
25|$|The {{emergence}} of the human security discourse {{was the product of}} a convergence of factors {{at the end of the}} Cold War. These challenged the dominance of the neorealist paradigm’s focus on states, “mutually assured destruction” and military security and briefly enabled a broader concept of security to emerge. The increasingly rapid pace of globalisation; the failure of liberal state building through the instruments of the Washington Consensus; the reduced <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> war between the superpowers, the exponential rise in the spread and consolidation of democratisation and international human rights norms opened a space in which both ‘development’ and concepts of ‘security’ could be reconsidered.|$|E
25|$|Gulf War I {{was fought}} without the Iraqi Army unleashing {{chemical}} or biological munitions; Eric R. Taylor, of the CATO Institute, maintained that the effective, U.S. <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> retaliation halted Hussein from employing his chemical weapons. The locations of many of Iraq's chemical stockpiles were never uncovered and there is widespread speculation that U.S. troops were exposed to chemical munitions while destroying weapons caches, particularly near the Khamisiyah storage site. After the war, analysis suggested the chemical defense capabilities of U.S. forces were woefully inadequate {{during and after the}} conflict. In addition, some experts, such as Jonathan B. Tucker, suggest that the Iraqis did indeed employ chemical weapons during the war.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objections}} raised against total elimination <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> {{weapons are}} {{built around a}} few arguments mostly <b>of</b> non-technical nature. <b>Nuclear</b> weapons and the strategies for their use {{have resulted in the}} establishment of a vicious circle within which the international community is trapped. The argument that the world will be unsafe without nuclear weapons is only meant to further the narrow self-interest <b>of</b> the <b>nuclear</b> weapon states and their allies. The World Court’s far-reaching 1996 advisory opinion concluded that almost any use or <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> use <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons would violate international humanitarian law and law applicable in armed conflict, undermining most claims <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapon states regarding the legitimacy of possession, use or <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> use <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons. The next logical step would be an initiative for a nuclear convention banning the use and <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> use <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons in Asia and the adjoining oceans. But as long as the dominant elites in society and the nation-state believe in the utility <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons for national security or as the currency of power, abolition <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons will remain a mirage...|$|R

25|$|Countdown to Zero, an exposé of {{the present-day}} <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> proliferation, also premiered at Sundance 2010, {{the first time}} a {{director}} has had two feature documentaries in one year at this festival. It also played in the Official Selection at Cannes Film Festival, before being released in the US by Magnolia Pictures, in the UK by Dogwoof, and in Japan by Paramount. Its contribution to the debate building to the ratification of the New START Treaty earned Walker a nomination for Arms Control Person of the Year The documentary was credited with raising public awareness and understanding of the dangers posed by nuclear weapons in the 21st century and with helping mobilize support for practical steps to reduce that danger.|$|E
25|$|Accurate {{calculations}} {{had already}} {{shown that the}} BMEWS system would give just ten to 25 minutes of warning {{in the case of}} an ICBM attack. The MIDAS system, as planned, would extend this warning time to about 30 minutes, giving the extra time needed for all of the Strategic Air Command's nuclear-armed heavy bombers to take off from their air bases, and hence proving to the Soviet government that it could not destroy these bombers in a sneak attack. Hence, the Soviets would be deterred from launching such an attack by a valid <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> retaliation. In addition, the MIDAS system should have been able to confirm radar detections from BMEWS of a thermonuclear attack, hence reducing the chances of an accidental nuclear false alarm from the radar system.|$|E

Even so, during Andropov's fifteen-month rule Galina stopped appearing in public. At the funeral, Andropov praised Brezhnev for his [...] "struggle for the relaxation of international tensions and for delivering mankind from the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> war" [...] and his détente policy.
