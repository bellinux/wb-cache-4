5|$|In al-Karak, an-Nasir Ahmad had Tashtamur and Qutlubugha {{executed}} for unclear reasons. The move to execute them appalled the public, with whom an-Nasir Ahmad was steadily losing credibility with. The executions {{were seen as}} a testament of an-Nasir Ahmad's ingratitude {{to the men who}} had supported him and virtually installed him as sultan. Historian Joseph Drory argues <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> Tashtamur and Qutlubugha compelled him to assume the sultanate and remove him from his self-imposed isolation in al-Karak that made an-Nasir Ahmad resentful toward them.|$|E
5|$|In the fallout, Bo {{was removed}} {{as the party}} chief of Chongqing and lost his seat on the Politburo. Bo's {{dismissal}} exposed disunity within Communist Party ranks shortly before a major leadership transition, and some observers suspected <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> he threatened Xi Jinping's future grip on power. He was later stripped of all his positions, lost his seat at the National People's Congress, and was eventually expelled from the party.|$|E
5|$|The bill {{received}} Royal Assent on 13 August 1888 with Hanley listed {{among those}} places {{to be granted}} county borough status. The corporation of Hanley vacillated for several months as to how best to proceed, then in February 1889 opted for Hanley to take its county borough status, effectively killing both the county proposal and the county borough proposal. Why Hanley corporation made such a decision is not recorded, but it {{was reported in the}} Staffordshire Sentinel of 5 February 1901 <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> Stoke Corporation insisted that the administrative centre of the new county be in Stoke, not Hanley, and this was something that Hanley could not agree too.|$|E
40|$|Why do rising incomes {{not make}} people happier? Some argue <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> we quickly become {{accustomed}} to our new acquisitions. Others would say <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> relative status <b>is</b> the goal, not the material acquisitions themselves. But Avner Offer opines <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> we {{have a difficult time}} postponing gratification. This is an intriguing notion, one of many in his new book. ...|$|R

50|$|In {{response}} to {{allegations that the}} program unfairly targets African-American and Hispanic-American individuals, then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg has stated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans {{are more likely to}} be violent criminals and victims of violent crime.|$|R
5|$|The {{day after}} the announcement, the Harvey-led Victorians met Craig's New South Welshmen at the SCG. Harvey {{admitted}} to being irked by the board's snub and felt <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> of his blunt nature. The men were cordial at the toss and Craig sent the Victorians in to bat. At the same time, Colin McDonald broke his nose while practising in the nets and was taken to hospital. Harvey asked Craig for a gentleman's agreement to allow a substitute, but the home skipper refused. An angry Harvey struck 209 in five hours, but Craig scored 45 and 93 to help secure a draw and therefore win the Sheffield Shield.|$|E
5|$|The deputies and the Junta met on December 18, {{to decide}} what to do. Funes, who was close to Saavedra, argued that Buenos Aires had no right to appoint {{national}} authorities by itself and expect obedience from the provinces. The nine deputies voted for their incorporation, as did Larrea, Azcuénaga, Matheu and Alberti, founding members of the Junta. Saavedra declared that the incorporation was not fully legal, but that he supported it for public convenience. Only Juan José Paso voted with Moreno against the incorporation of the deputies. Left in a minority within the Junta, Moreno resigned. He was appointed to a diplomatic mission in Europe, but died in high seas, in unclear circumstances. Some historians consider that Saavedra plotted to murder Moreno, others that it was a negligence of the captain, and others <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> of Moreno's frail health.|$|E
5|$|On the July 4, 2008 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Edge took his frustrations out on Vickie because {{he lost the}} title and told her the wedding was off. The {{following}} week, however, after Guerrero saved Edge from a con-chair-to by The Big Show, Edge re-proposed, and the wedding was back on. On July 18, 2008 at the wedding reception, Triple H came out and showed a video of Edge cheating on Guerrero the day before with the wedding planner, Alicia Fox. The angle continued at The Great American Bash in July, when Fox attempted to hand Edge the WWE Championship belt {{to use as a}} weapon against Triple H, but was stopped by Guerrero. Edge attempted to spear Triple H but hit Guerrero instead, with the distraction, Triple H performed a Pedigree on Edge to retain the WWE title. Edge attempted to apologize to Guerrero, even though he was seen talking to Fox, but she revealed to him that she had rehired The Undertaker and that Edge would face him in a Hell in a Cell match at SummerSlam. Edge then turned on La Familia during the August 8 episode of SmackDown, performing a one-man con-chair-to on Chavo in the ring, and tossed Guerrero out of her wheelchair, effectively disbanding the faction. The following week, Edge verbally assaulted Guerrero, before he forced her to apologize to The Undertaker for what she did to him. He also mentioned to Guerrero, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> of her that La Familia suffered. At SummerSlam, The Undertaker defeated Edge, and after the match, Undertaker chokeslammed Edge off the top of a ladder and through the ring canvas, with flames rising from the hole.|$|E

5|$|Prior to her disappearance, {{according}} to her friends, Carol was feeling depressed. She had talked of tracing her biological parents, as she was adopted. On 17 July 1976, she went missing. Gordon claimed that she had left home for another man, and Carol had left their home in Leece twice before. It was for this reason, Gordon claimed, {{that he did not}} report her missing for six weeks. Carol was said to time her periods away from home to coincide with the school holidays. Gordon claimed that it wasn't until she didn't return in time to take up her job as a primary school teacher in September (the start of the school term) that he realised that there was a problem. At this time he reported her missing via his solicitor, and her family was informed. On the day she vanished, the family had been due to visit Blackpool on a day trip. However, Carol said she felt unwell and wanted to remain behind in bed. She was never seen alive again by her family. Gordon claimed he returned home to find Carol had left the house, leaving behind her wedding ring, {{and that there was no}} sign of a struggle. A missing persons enquiry was launched, but nothing came of it. This missing persons report was subsequently lost, and it was implied by some <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> both Gordon and a senior police commander (who, by the time the article was published, had died) involved in the case were freemasons. This was rebutted by Sandra Lean, who, in No Smoke, claimed that Gordon had never been a freemason. At the time, police told Gordon that, should a body be found, he would be the main suspect.|$|E

25|$|In 1961, Grossman put {{together}} Mary Travers, Noel Stookey, and Peter Yarrow as the folk group Peter, Paul and Mary. They quickly achieved success when their eponymous first album entered the Billboard Top Ten in 1962. The group had been avidly pursued by Atlantic Records, {{who were on}} the verge of signing them when the deal inexplicably fell through. The group signed with Warner Bros. Records instead and Atlantic's executives later discovered <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> music publisher Artie Mogull had introduced Grossman to Warner executive Herman Starr, from whom Grossman was able to extract an unprecedented deal that gave the trio complete creative control over the recording and packaging of their music. Over the course of his career, Grossman's client list included Todd Rundgren, Odetta, Peter, Paul and Mary, John Lee Hooker, Ian and Sylvia, Phil Ochs (early in his career), Gordon Lightfoot, Richie Havens, The Pozo Seco Singers, The Band, the Electric Flag, Jesse Winchester, and Janis Joplin.|$|E

25|$|In 824, Emperor Muzong {{died and}} was succeeded {{by his son}} Emperor Jingzong. In the {{aftermath}} of Emperor Jingzong's ascension, Li Fengji had Wang Shoucheng informed Emperor Jingzong <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> of Li Fengji's support that Emperor Muzong made him crown prince—and that Li Shen and the former chancellor Du Yuanying had both supported Emperor Muzong's younger brother Li Cong (李悰) the Prince of Shen. Believing Wang's assertions, Emperor Jingzong exiled Li Shen to be the military advisor to the prefect of Chao Prefecture (潮州, in modern Chaozhou, Guangdong), and demoted two imperial scholars that Li Shen had recommended, Pang Yan (龐嚴) and Jiang Fang (蔣防), to be prefects of two other distant prefectures. Li Fengji's associates subsequently often asked that Li Shen be put to death, and Emperor Jingzong initially agreed. After the junior imperial scholar Wei Chuhou submitted a petition in Li Shen's defense, Emperor Jingzong reviewed the palace archives and found that both Du and Li Shen (as well as Pei Du) had also supported him as crown prince, Emperor Jingzong destroyed all the reports accusing Li Shen of crimes, {{although he did not}} recall Li Shen to Chang'an.|$|E
25|$|Gardner {{would reveal}} {{little about the}} coven and its members, {{although}} claimed that in August 1940, during {{the midst of the}} Second World War, they performed a ritual known as Operation Cone of Power which they hoped would influence the High Command of Nazi Germany and prevent them from invading Britain. This magical ritual, Gardner claimed, took place inside the Forest, and involved the Witches raising a Cone of Power which they directed toward Germany and focused on sending the message into the minds of the German leaders {{that they would not be}} able to cross the English Channel. Gardner also noted that several of the older and frailer practicing Witches died after practicing the ritual, something that was confirmed by Louis Wilkinson, who claimed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> they had performed the ritual naked, without goose grease on the skin to keep them warm, and that as such they had contracted pneumonia. Investigating these claims, Heselton found two locals who died soon after the ritual: a reporter, Walter Forder (1881–1940), and a blacksmith, Charles Loader (1864–1940), whom he speculated were involved in the rite.|$|E
25|$|CHP leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, {{who oversaw}} {{a drop of}} 1% in his party's vote share since the 2011 general election, issued a {{statement}} praising democracy for ousting the AKP majority government from power. Despite the CHP claiming <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> of them that the AKP failed to win a majority, media commentators claimed that the decrease in their vote and seat share showed {{that it was in}} fact the HDP and MHP that had more of an effect on the result. CHP spokesperson Haluk Koç stated that the CHP was now in the most likely position to be included in a coalition, with Kılıçdaroğlu allegedly attempting to form a CHP-MHP minority coalition with outside support from the HDP. Kılıçdaroğlu appeared to have refused to consider a coalition with the AKP. In response to a question of whether he would resign after presiding over a decrease in the CHP vote, Kılıçdaroğlu refused to comment but claimed that he was perfectly happy with the election result. Despite this, the President of the Turkish Bars Association and CHP member Metin Feyzioğlu stated that a convention should be called due to the poor election result. The drop in the CHP's vote share was largely attributed to CHP voters tactically voting for the HDP to increase the chances of them surpassing the 10% parliamentary threshold.|$|E

However, historical records indicate the words to be [...] "Watson, come here, I want you." [...] The error was not present in Paul Cornell's original script, but crept in {{at some point during}} production. Producer Phil Collinson speculated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> the line was rerecorded; it was originally recorded by someone who the production team felt put on too false of a Scottish accent, and so it was rerecorded with a real Scot.|$|E
500|$|Because of his {{fluency in}} several languages, Sarria was {{assigned}} to Intelligence School. However, following a routine background check for security clearance, he was advised that {{he would no longer}} be in the program. Sarria assumed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> investigators discovered his homosexuality. [...] "I mean I had no lisp, but I wasn't the most masculine guy in town... So I think that they figured that I was a little bit gay." [...] Sarria officially remained attached to the Signal Corps but was ordered to Cooks and Bakers School and trained as a cook.

[...] Opinions differ as to Davis's inability to hold a consistent starting role with the Rangers; while one popular theory is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> of his many strikeouts and low batting average, Orioles' manager Buck Showalter believes it was due to the presence of Moreland and Adrián Beltré in Texas.

500|$|The album {{begins with}} a number of up-tempo songs before {{expanding}} to a variety of tempos for its second half. Vedder attributed the faster and more aggressive songs to the band writing a lot of material that kept getting pared down, with the band leaving behind mid-tempo songs, while Ament suggested <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> of the band balancing recording and touring which resulted in [...] "physicality... from being out on the road." [...] The band attempted to create an environment in which McCready and drummer Matt Cameron could play much as they do live. Ament said that there was [...] "a lot of honing of the guitars and vocals in the middle and toward the end," [...] which resulted in the album sounding [...] "more polished." [...] On the overall feeling of the album, Ament said, [...] "The band playing in a room—that came across. There's a kind of immediacy to the record, and that's what we were going for." ...|$|E
500|$|Grant {{was fascinated}} by the work of the occultist Aleister Crowley, having read a number of his books. Eager to meet Crowley, Grant unsuccessfully wrote to Crowley's {{publisher}}s, asking them to give him his address; however, the publisher had moved address themselves, meaning that they never received his letter. He also requested that Michael Houghton, proprietor of Central London's esoteric bookstore Atlantis Bookshop, introduce him to Crowley. Houghton refused, privately remarking that Grant was [...] "mentally unstable." [...] Grant later stated his opinion that Houghton had refused because he didn't wish to [...] "incur evil karma" [...] from introducing the young man to Crowley, but later suggested <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> Houghton desired him for his own organisation, The Order of Hidden Masters, and thereby didn't want him to become Crowley's disciple. Persisting, Grant wrote letters to the new address of Crowley's publishers, asking that they pass his letters on to Crowley himself. These resulted in the first meeting between the two, in autumn 1944, at the Bell Inn in Buckinghamshire.|$|E

[...] Paul Flynn from The Guardian said that Ivan was a [...] "hot bisexual" [...] and felt that his storyline with Paul and Nicola was [...] "played without resorting to cheap laughter". Terry Ramsey of the Evening Standard questioned why Ivan even returned to the village after his break. The writer concluded <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> [...] "Emmerdale is probably the only bisexual-friendly village in Yorkshire". Upon learning that Brocklebank was leaving the series, the Daily Mail's Carrie Fitton said that as [...] "the only bisexual binman in the village he had staying power".|$|E
