5|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> mainly serves Aqueduct Racetrack, {{the station}} is not well-used {{compared}} to other stations in the system. During the 1970s ridership at the station declined, from 1.1 million passengers in 1975 to 573,000 in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the basic}} physics of {{polonium}} was classified until after the war. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was used as an}} initiator was classified until the 1960s.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "playa" [...] means {{beach in}} Spanish, which alludes to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> based on <b>the</b> Spanish SEAT Ibiza.|$|R

5|$|Tipu's Tiger {{is notable}} {{as an example}} of early musical automata from India, and also for <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was {{especially}} constructed for Tipu Sultan.|$|E
5|$|Although Dean {{was still}} a {{hurricane}} and was expected to re-strengthen slightly before making its second landfall, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had weakened caused some residents to let down their guard. As a result, residents of Veracruz and Campeche were much less prepared for the storm than those on the Yucatán Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} for {{the album was}} generally favorable, with several reviewers pointing out <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> highly resembled the band's debut album. Critics also said the album was less groundbreaking than their debut but had humorous and enjoyable pieces. The album peaked at 148 on the Billboard 200 despite its critical acclaim {{as well as the}} band members expecting more commercial success.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> {{more likely}} to draw the short straw from a smaller bunch is {{perfectly}} compensated by the chance of somebody else pulling the straw out before you.|$|R
5|$|Fleming {{developed}} the James Bond character more in Goldfinger {{than in the}} previous six novels, presenting him as a more complex individual, whilst also bringing out a theme of Bond as Saint George. The Saint George theme is echoed by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a British agent sorting out an American problem.|$|E
5|$|Little Fishing Creek {{was entered}} into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its {{identifier}} in the Geographic Names Information System is 1179545. The creek is named for <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is smaller than Fishing Creek, which it is a tributary of. Little fishing Creek {{is also known as}} Hemlock Creek. This variant name appears in a 1982 map of Columbia County published by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} the account's {{authenticity}} has been questioned is <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> claims St-Calais was knowledgeable in canon law. Offler doubted that canon law had penetrated to England to any great degree in 1088. The historian Mark Philpott, however, argues that St-Calais was knowledgeable in canon law, since he owned a copy of one of the basis of canon law, the False Decretals. The bishop's manuscript of the Decretals still survives.|$|E
5000|$|A row-modeled {{table is}} {{homogeneous}} in <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> describes: a Line Items table describes only products sold. By contrast, an EAV table contains almost {{any type of}} fact.|$|R
5000|$|Pomet (1548 or 1553) - some Croatian historiographers {{argue that}} Pomet is indeed Marin's oldest play, his debut, while others disagree. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> lost {{makes it harder}} to {{classify}} it.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ambiguity}} of the term shamayim in the Hebrew Bible, and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> a plural word, give [...] "heavens" [...] various interpretations regarding its nature, notably the ascension of the prophet Elijah.|$|R
5|$|S.thiersii may be {{gathered}} inadvertently and {{thought to be}} edible due to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> grows on lawns among grasses. This {{is in contrast to}} Amanita species which grow around trees and are thus usually seen in forests. It can be distinguished from other white fungi growing in grassland by its fluffy cap, though the white veil fragments may eventually get washed away by rain.|$|E
5|$|Thio {{also argued}} that without a constitutionally {{expressed}} right to vote, the judiciary is handicapped in interpreting this implied right, given its conservative approach to reading the Constitution and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is unlikely to appeal to normative ideas such as representative democracy.|$|E
5|$|Universal Pictures spent $2.1million {{to market}} the film in a 30-second {{television}} spot during Super Bowl XXXVII on January 26, 2003. And a 70-second teaser trailer was attached to Spider-Man on May 3, 2002. Just weeks before the film's release, a number of workprints were leaked on the Internet. The visual and special effects were already being criticized, despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not the final editing cut of the film.|$|E
5000|$|Workman also {{discussed}} {{his love for}} Canada stating, [...] "I love Canada. I've got a maple-leaf tattoo. I like <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> safe there, <b>that</b> you don't {{have to think about}} getting mugged.".|$|R
5000|$|Dub-L {{produced}} Aesop Rock's first album, Music for Earthworms, in 1997. Dub-L {{has said}} that he is in possession of the masters but will not re-release it, because he likes <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> [...] "rare and legendary." ...|$|R
5000|$|Killer Moth: A foe that {{is rather}} annoying, it charges at Bomberman {{whenever}} it catches sight of him. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> always [...] "in your face" [...] makes the Killer Moth troublesome to hit and causes frustration.|$|R
5|$|Above {{the central}} figure shines a single small star {{at the very top}} of the picture, serving as a symbol of further hope beyond that of {{the central figure}} herself. The {{distance}} of the star from the central figure, and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is outside her field of vision even were she not blindfolded, suggests an ambiguity. It provides an uplifting message to the viewer that things are not as bad for the central character as she believes, and introduces a further element of pathos in that she is unaware of hope existing elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Adrastea {{is one of}} the few moons in the Solar System {{known to}} orbit its planet in less than the length of that planet's day. It orbits at the edge of Jupiter's Main Ring and is thought to be the main {{contributor}} of material to the Rings of Jupiter. Despite observations made in the 1990s by the Galileo spacecraft, very little is known about the moon's physical characteristics other than its size and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is tidally locked to Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|After much fanfare, Muhammad departs jannah airport, {{riding a}} buraq, or winged horse. The Archangel Gabriel accompanies him. On the way, they {{encounter}} a Soviet spacecraft. Hearing {{that they are}} infidels, Muhammad approaches to investigate, only to crash into the spacecraft, obliterating it and the buraq and killing the three cosmonauts; Muhammad and Gabriel are able to catch a cloud. Later, they pass Jakarta, which Gabriel describes as the most sinful place on Earth. Angered by Gabriel's statement that less than a million of Indonesia's 90 million Muslims are true believers, as well as <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is the birthplace of Nasakom, Muhammad declares that Islam will never die and waits on the cloud.|$|E
5000|$|The name of {{the album}} is {{pronounced}} [...] "five deep", not [...] "vee deep" [...] and refers to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> <b>the</b> band's fifth album and also that they became a five-piece following the departure of Gerry Cott.|$|R
50|$|Pioneerball - a {{game with}} a ball, similar in its rules to volleyball. Originated in the USSR in the 1930s. The {{name of the game}} comes from <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> {{a game with}} a ball and was played by pioneers.|$|R
5000|$|According to Howard Benson, {{the album}} {{was not meant to}} be a concept album, but John Cooper said [...] "I don't love concept records typically; the {{emphasis}} is on <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> a concept record rather than good songs." ...|$|R
5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} known about the {{behaviour}} of Newton's parakeet, but it is probable that it was similar to that of other members of its genus. Leguat mentioned that the parrots of the island ate the nuts of the bois d'olive tree (Cassine orientalis). Tafforet also stated that the parrots ate the seeds of the bois de buis shrub (Fernelia buxifolia), which is endangered today, but was common all over Rodrigues and nearby islets during his visit. Newton's parakeet may have fed on leaves as the related echo parakeet does. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> survived long after Rodrigues had been heavily deforested shows that its ecology was less vulnerable than that of, for example, the Rodrigues parrot.|$|E
5|$|Although {{polyadenylation}} is seen {{in almost}} all organisms, it is not universal. However, the wide distribution of this modification and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is present in organisms from all three domains of life implies that the last universal common ancestor of all living organisms, it is presumed, had some form of polyadenylation system. A few organisms do not polyadenylate mRNA, which implies that they have lost their polyadenylation machineries during evolution. Although no examples of eukaryotes that lack polyadenylation are known, mRNAs from the bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum and the salt-tolerant archaean Haloferax volcanii lack this modification.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Carter and Rosas' writing, vision had not been {{directly}} studied, but field observations show the animal primarily hunts by sight; above water, {{it is able to}} recognize observers at great distances. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is exclusively active during the day further suggests its eyesight should be strong, to aid in hunting and predator avoidance. In other otter species, vision is generally normal or slightly myopic, both on land and in water. The giant otter's hearing is acute and its sense of smell is excellent.|$|E
5000|$|The bridge remains underused and {{has become}} a white {{elephant}} project. It has been widely criticised for <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had served no purpose of linking to an unpopulated island which incurred a project cost of RM 120 million.|$|R
5000|$|With {{reference}} to this scandal, former British defence secretary Ian Gilmour, Baron Gilmour of Craigmillar told the BBC: [...] "If you are paying bribes to high-up people in <b>the</b> government, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> illegal in Saudi law doesn't mean much." ...|$|R
25|$|While {{there is}} no general {{inductive}} definition of log (unlike for exp), the partial results are given in terms of such definitions. In this way, the logarithm can be calculated explicitly, without reference to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> <b>the</b> inverse of the exponential.|$|R
