40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{optimise}} the hygienic efficiency of slaughter and dressing operations. Three strategic approaches, namely reducing and removing or killing the bacteria attached to meat surfaces, were considered. The second option of removal was selected for development, as current technology inevitably results in bacterial contamination, while killing bacteria on meat surfaces requires drastic treatments that may adversely affect quality parameters. The initial attachment mechanism between bacteria and the carcass surface (reversible attachment) was studied using the collagen film model system. Bacterial attachment to the collagen model was compared with attachment to cut beef muscle and uncut beef muscle using viable count procedure. Scanning electron microscopy and direct microscopic count procedure using an epifluorescence microscope was also developed using both collagen films mounted on microscope slides and collagen coated microscope slides. The collagen film viable count system was the method selected to model bacterial attachment to meat because of ease and consistency of quantification. There was no positive correlation between attachment and many bacterial cell surface factors such as charge, hydrophobicity, protein and polysaccharide surface molecules. Different eluents were used to identify the principal component interfering with single attachment mechanisms on electrostatic interaction and hydrophobic interaction chromatographic columns and on collagen film. Three components interfering with the isolated attachment mechanisms were identified. They were Tween, sodium chloride (NaCl) and mannose. Further column studies indicated that cell surface proteins play a more important role in cell surface negative charge and hydrophobicity than do surface polysaccharides. A wash solution was formulated using the components Tween, NaCl and mannose to reverse what were believed to be the major attachment mechanisms. Further trials with Tween, NaCl and mannose and increasing their concentrations and the application of increased vigorous rinsing also proved ineffective for washing the cells from meat surfaces. This result also supports the hypothesis that bacterial attachment to meat surface is very complex and multifactorial. Elution studies using 10 % <b>Tri</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> pH 12. 0 killed the cells rather than removing them and further work will be directed towards the killing...|$|E

50|$|Assuming {{the proper}} EN {{formulation}} is selected {{to deliver the}} desired stress level, a reduction in compressive stress or even a shift to tensile is possible under certain conditions and must be avoided. Operating an EN bath outside of its recommend guidelines will impact stress. As a plater desires to push a process to plate faster, raising the pH is often the first button to push. When the pH is increased the deposit phosphorus drops, compressive stress is reduced and {{this can lead to}} negative results. Platers are commonly surprised to find a process that was plating with no stress cracks or adhesion failure the day before is now producing failures. A simple view of the record books or quick analysis reveals the culprit. An even more common contributor to an increase in an EN deposits tensile nature is bath age. It has been well documented that an EN process designed to produce a compressive deposit will stop doing so after a certain bath age (roughly 5 metal turnovers). It is at this point where the presence of reaction by products, <b>sodium</b> <b>orthophosphate,</b> begins to contribute to tensile stress. One can continue to plate in this bath but must be fully aware that stress will increase and could lead to adhesion and/or cracking failures. This is most evident, again, with thicker films. Figure 13 represents this phenomenon. There are certain additives that, when used carefully, can reduce the tensile stress even as the EN bath ages.The photos in figure 14 are of two identical parts, each plated in the same bath but at different bath ages. The part on the right was plated in a relatively new bath whereas {{the one on the left}} was plated in a bath nearly 10 metal turnovers old.

The meal was divided into five equal portions and mixed thoroughly with already prepared buffer solutions from citric acid, <b>sodium</b> <b>orthophosphate,</b> -analytical grade (10 % by weight buffer and kept in stainless containers to ferment at room temperature (30 o C). Samples were withdrawn at intervals of 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 h, dewatered, sifted and toasted into gari and packaged in cellophane bags. The process was again carried out at 35 and 40 o C. The product gari was subjected to functional analysis (swelling index, pH, titrable acidity, water absorption capacity and residual cyanide) and sensory evaluation (appearance, taste and general acceptability) for the uncooked gari. The results obtained show that the buffer treated samples had high pH than the control sample. The highest mean pH was recorded for the BS = 8. 0, (7. 19), followed by BS = 7. 0 (6. 55) and BS = 6. 0 (5. 97), while the control had the lowest 4. 5. The highest Swelling Index (SI) (17. 45 ml/ml) was obtained for BS = 5. 0 and closely followed by BS = 6. 0 (17. 14 ml/ml) while BS = 8. 0 recorded the least 16. 91 ml/ml. The buffer at pH 7. 0 reduced the cyanide content to 7. 69 mg HCN/kg, which {{is lower than the}} safe level of 10 mg HCN/kg. Moreover the gari from BF = 5. 0 (5. 4) and BF = 6. 0 were the preferred in terms of general acceptability while the gari from the control BF = 0. 0 (4. 8) was rated the least. The buffer treated samples also performed better than the control in bulk density and general acceptability as rated by the panelists. Therefore controlling the process variables (pH, temperature and fermentation time) while fermenting cassava mash for gari production is sure way to enhance product quality and safety...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A simple, accurate, precise RP-HPLC {{method has}} been {{developed}} for the estimation of Rizatriptan Benzoate. Good chromatographic separation was achieved by isocratic mode with <b>Sodium</b> dihydrogen <b>orthophosphate</b> as buffer (pH 3. 5) : Acetonitrile (80 : 20), as the mobile phase with Zorbax SB phenyl column (250 x 4. 6 mm i. d, 5 µ particle size) as stationary phase with a flow rate of 1. 0 ml/min at ambient temperature. Quantification was attained with UV detection at a wavelength of 255 nm. The retention time for Benzoate and Rizatriptan was 3. 85 minutes and 4. 32 minutes respectively. The calibration graphs were linear in the concentration range of 5 – 25 μg/ml.

40|$|A {{medium for}} the optimal growth of Chaetoceros calcitrans in batch and {{continuous}} culture systems was developed. A method {{was developed for}} continuous culture of C. calcitrans that was free from detrimental infection by bacteria. The concentration of tested nutrients in the developed medium were sodium nitrate, 160 mg/L; <b>sodium</b> dihydrogen <b>orthophosphate,</b> 40 mg/L; and the molar Si:N ratio was 0. 25 (99. 9 mg/L sodium metasilicate). Isolated bacterial strains were shown to be detrimental {{to the growth of}} C. calcitrans in batch and continuous culture. Electrolytically treated water was suitable for the growth of C. calcitrans, but a subsequent flourish of bacterial growth at the late exponential phase reduced the quality of the algal cells and made the culture unsuitable for feeding to shellfish larvae. Heat treated water (95 °C for ten and a half minutes) gave stable growth for the continuous culture of C. calcitrans in 38 L plastic bioreactor bags for at least 38 days. The superficial gas velocity in the culture bags was 0. 09 L/min. Higher superficial gas velocities (e. g. 0. 40 L/min were detrimental to C. calcitrans...|$|R
