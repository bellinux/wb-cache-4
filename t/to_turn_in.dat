5|$|Electronic Arts' 1983 game Worms? is an {{interactive}} implementation of Paterson's worms, where {{each time a}} worm has <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> {{a way that it}} lacks a rule for, it stops and lets the user choose a direction, which sets that rule for that worm.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{displayed}} on a black-and-white television screen, and the tanks are controlled by two joysticks each. Pushing both joysticks moves the player's tank forward, and pulling them both back causes the tank to stop. Pulling them in different directions or amounts causes the tank <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> place or while moving, respectively. A button {{on the top of}} the right joystick fires a shell.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the recall}} process, Republican George Rivera {{announced}} his candidacy for Giron's senate seat. Rivera {{was planning to}} run against Giron in the 2014 elections but stated he would put {{his name on the}} ballot during the recall process. Rivera had <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> a petition with 1,000 signatures in order to qualify to be on the ballot and turned in 1,500 signatures on July 26. Sonia Negrete Winn, a Democrat, also sought to be on the ballot to replace Giron, but failed to obtain the required signatures to be a candidate. In Morse's district, Republican Bernie Herpin announced his interest in replacing Morse and submitted sufficient signatures to qualify for the ballot.|$|E

5|$|Foster's {{flair for}} musical melodrama inspires Madonna <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> what is easily her most assured and {{full-bodied}} vocal performance to date. Amid {{a swirl of}} strings and Spanish guitars, she spews the song's declaration of romantic independence with a theatrical verve that perfectly matches the stagey, potentially overpowering tone of Foster's arrangement without flying {{over the heads of}} her youthful top 40 following. A stunning effort that could easily become the 'I Will Survive' of this generation.|$|E
5|$|In Two Grey Hills, New Mexico, Albert Hosteen (Floyd Red Crow Westerman) and {{his family}} are beaten by the Men in Black as they search for the {{whereabouts}} of Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is pursued by a black helicopter before soldiers retrieve her printed copies of Albert's translations of the digital tape. Scully denies having the original tape, saying it is in Mulder's possession. Upon returning to Washington, the FBI puts Scully on mandatory leave and forces her <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> her badge and gun. Upon entering Mulder's office, she finds the tape missing.|$|E
5|$|In early 1973, {{with the}} ransom money still missing, The Oregon Journal republished the serial numbers and offered $1,000 {{to the first}} person <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> a ransom bill to the {{newspaper}} or any FBI field office. In Seattle, the Post-Intelligencer made a similar offer with a $5,000 reward. The offers remained in effect until Thanksgiving 1974, and though there were several near-matches, no genuine bills were found. In 1975 Northwest Orient's insurer, Global Indemnity Co., complied with an order from the Minnesota Supreme Court and paid the airline's $180,000 claim on the ransom money.|$|E

5|$|To the {{attacker}}s' surprise, Voss {{did not try}} {{to escape}} the aerial trap. Instead, he flicked his triplane about in a flat spin and fired at his attackers in a headon firing pass, holing McCudden's wings. Voss riddled Cronyn's SE.5 from close range, putting him out of the dogfight. Cronyn had <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> under his attacker and throw his aircraft into a spin to escape being killed. His wingmates attacked Voss while Cronyn also limped for home.|$|E
5|$|After Urilla's death, Wyatt {{went through}} a {{downward}} spiral and {{had a series of}} legal problems. On March 14, 1871, Barton County filed a lawsuit against Earp and his sureties. Earp was in charge of collecting license fees for Lamar, which funded local schools, and he was accused of failing <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> the fees. On March 31, James Cromwell filed a lawsuit against Earp, alleging that Earp had falsified court documents about the amount of money collected from Cromwell to satisfy a judgment. To make up the difference between what Earp turned in and Cromwell owed (which he claimed to have paid), the court seized Cromwell's mowing machine and sold it for $38. Cromwell's suit claimed that Earp owed him $75, the estimated value of the machine.|$|E
5|$|Harry and Hermione {{continue}} the quest, discovering more about Dumbledore's past, including {{the death of}} Dumbledore's younger sister and his connection to the dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald. They travel to Godric's Hollow, Harry's birthplace and the place where his parents died, and meet the elderly magical historian Bathilda Bagshot, but she {{turns out to be}} Nagini in disguise, awaiting their arrival. The snake attacks Harry and again they barely escape, but Harry's wand is destroyed. Their luck finally appears <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> the Forest of Dean. A mysterious silver doe Patronus appears and guides Harry to an icy pond containing the Sword of Hogwarts co-founder Godric Gryffindor, one of the few objects able to destroy Horcruxes. During Harry's attempt to recover the sword, the Horcrux attempts to kill him. He is saved by Ron, who was guided back by the Deluminator, and they realise Dumbledore's gifts may be meaningful. Ron takes the sword and uses it to destroy the locket.|$|E

5|$|In 1782, the Tây Sơn {{attacked}} Gia Định (later {{known as}} Saigon and now Ho Chi Minh City) again and forced Nguyễn Ánh {{to flee to}} the island of Phú Quốc under Duyệt's escort. It {{was one of many}} times when Gia Định changed hands. In 1787, Duyệt began organizing and commanding his own unit, and individually recruited his own enlisted men. In 1788, the tide began <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> favour of the Nguyễn, after Pigneau de Behaine, a French Catholic priest who befriended Nguyễn Ánh {{in the hope that the}} young prince would gain power and give special privileges to his religion, recruited French military officers to fight for the Nguyễn. In 1788, the Nguyễn recaptured Gia Định and never relinquished it again. From then on, Nguyễn Ánh transformed the city into a fortress and his powerbase and began consolidating his hold on the surrounding area, before attacking the Tây Sơn with a view to eliminating them.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} over, Compton bowled a googly to deceive Bradman, who {{expected}} the ball <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>in.</b> However, it went the other way, took the outside edge {{and ran away}} past slip for four. Bradman leg glanced the next ball for another boundary, before again failing to read a googly on the third ball of the over. This time the edge went to Crapp, who failed {{to hold on to}} the catch. The sixth ball of Compton's over beat Bradman and hit him on the pads. Compton had control of Bradman for the over, but went unrewarded. At the other end, Morris continued to plunder Hutton's inaccurate leg breaks, and Australia reached lunch at 121/1, with Morris on 63 and Bradman on 35. Hutton had conceded 30 runs in four overs, and in the half hour preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs. Both Morris and Bradman had been given lives. Although Australia had scored at a reasonable rate, they had also been troubled by many of the deliveries and were expected to face further difficulty if they were to avoid defeat.|$|E

5|$|On April 13, 2013, during at the 2013's Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Pusha T {{announced}} that he would be going to Paris later this week, just to put on some final touches on the album, afterwards he would announce a release date. In June 2013, Pusha T had been set <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> the album to Def Jam for mastering, however, Kanye West presented Pusha with some additional beats. This resulted in Pusha going back to the studio to continue the recording. In early stages in the recording process, he began working on the album with Kanye West, Symbolyc One, The Neptunes, Bangladesh, and Ryan Leslie. Since then, he has confirmed that he was working with The-Dream, Just Blaze, No I.D., Nottz, Don Cannon, Nashiem Myrick, Carlos Brody (of The Hitmen), DJ Mano, Swizz Beatz, Rico Beats, Travi$ Scott, Hudson Mohawke, Young Chop, and Sham, amongst others on the album's production. On August 4, 2013 he {{announced that}} the song he wants to be the album's intro is produced by Joaquin Phoenix. On August 22, 2013, Pusha T appeared on MTV's RapFix and told Sway Calloway that the bulk of the album's production would be handled by Kanye West, while confirming production by Pharrell, Swizz Beatz, The-Dream, Nottz, and Don Cannon to be featured on the album.|$|E
5|$|Sánchez rebounded <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> another strong ride on Alpe d'Huez {{in stage}} 19. He, along with Contador and Pierre Rolland formed the leading {{group on the}} way up the climb. Contador, who had been riding out front much of the stage after an early attack, faded first and {{finished}} the day in third place. Rolland eventually rode away from Sánchez for the stage win, but Sánchez' second place on the day moved him up to seventh overall, and back into the mountains classification lead. Sánchez, as well as Contador, moved up a place in the stage 20 individual time trial. Damiano Cunego, who had been in fifth place and is considered a poor time trialist, had a bad race against the clock even by his standards, losing two minutes to most of the race's top overall riders and more than three to the stage winner. This moved him up to sixth place overall, the position in which he concluded the race the next day, while also finishing as mountains classification winner.|$|E
5|$|The two {{restaurant}} owners {{meet with}} Derrick, {{who does not}} react politely to them. However, they decide not <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> Derrick. The husband/father has an awakening about Amira as well and forgives her, turning in Nasir to the police for an expired visa. At Parker’s party, Mac (Tina Majorino) reconnects with Max (Adam Rose), and Veronica shows mild jealousy when Piz shows her his new fling. Logan gets Parker a romantic cake. In order to escape from an awkward suitor whom Logan introduces her to, Veronica asks Piz {{to pretend to be}} her boyfriend. Afterwards, Wallace informs her that Piz does have a crush on her. Veronica realizes that she has not realized this because of her preoccupation with her breakup with Logan. She talks to Piz on the porch at the party, and he suddenly kisses her. Piz retreats to the elevator, but Veronica appears and kisses him back. The elevator opens, revealing Logan.|$|E

50|$|Hook turns were {{originally}} the standard right <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> Australia. Various jurisdictions phased them out at different times. For example Melbourne changed <b>to</b> centre <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> 1954 for all right turns except for certain Central Business District intersections, {{in order to}} maintain a clearway in the center of major roads for the city's extensive tram network. Sydney and Newcastle changed <b>to</b> centre <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> 1939. By requiring vehicles <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> from the far lane, rather than the middle of the road, the hook <b>turn</b> was able <b>to</b> avoid conflicts between vehicles and trams without the need for extra traffic lanes or altered signals.|$|R
5|$|In {{southern}} Eaton County, {{the freeway}} parallels the Battle Creek River {{north of the}} junction with M-78. Near Olivet, I-69 begins <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> a northeasterly direction and curves around {{the north side of}} town. On the south side of Charlotte, I-69 turns northward, traversing an area to the east of downtown and crossing the former routing of US27, which is now part of the business loop for the city. Farther north, the freeway has a junction with M-50, a bridge over the Battle Creek River, and an interchange with the northern end of the business loop next to Fitch H. Beach Airport. North of the airport, I-69 turns northeasterly again and parallels Lansing Road, the former route of US27/M-78. The freeway meets the southern end of M-100 near Potterville and continues into the Lansing–East Lansing metropolitan area. Southwest of the state's capital city, I-69 crosses over Lansing Road near Lansing Delta Township Assembly, a factory for General Motors; northeast of the complex, I-69 merges into I-96. The combined I-96/I-69 runs northward through the suburban edges of the Lansing area, intersecting the western ends of I-496 and the BL I-69 for Lansing. The freeway enters Clinton County, and just north of a crossing of the Grand River, I-69 turns eastward to separate from I-96. As a part of the larger interchange with I-96, I-69 crosses BL I-96 (Grand River Avenue) without any connections.|$|E
