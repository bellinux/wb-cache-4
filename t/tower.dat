5|$|A quadrangular castle, Wressle Castle {{was laid}} out with four ranges in a square around a courtyard. At each corner was a <b>tower,</b> and in {{the centre of the}} east side was a five-storey gatehouse. Clockwise from north east the corner towers were named the Constable <b>Tower</b> (where the constable who ran the castle on a daily basis lived), the Chapel <b>Tower,</b> the Lord’s <b>Tower,</b> and the Kitchen <b>Tower.</b> Opposite the gatehouse, in the castle's west range, was the great hall and the Lord's <b>Tower</b> in the south west {{contained}} the owner's accommodation and private rooms.|$|E
5|$|During the {{construction}} of the James Bay transmission system, the cross-rope suspension <b>tower</b> was invented. This type of <b>tower</b> features two guyed-tower legs similar to the V-guyed <b>tower,</b> but the two legs don't converge at the <b>tower</b> base. In the case of the cross-rope suspension <b>tower,</b> the <b>tower</b> legs are spread apart on two different foundations. In addition, the crossbar is replaced by a series of suspension cables with three vertical insulator strings to support the three bundles, which allows this design to consume only 6.3 tonnes of steel per kilometre of line. The design is also known as the Chainette (little necklace).|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of its investigation, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{discovered}} that <b>tower</b> staffing levels at Blue Grass Airport violated an internal policy as reflected in a November 16, 2005, memorandum requiring two controllers during the overnight shift: one in the <b>tower</b> working clearance, ground, and <b>tower</b> frequencies, and another, either in the <b>tower</b> or remotely at Indianapolis Center, working TRACON (radar). At {{the time of the}} accident, the single controller in the <b>tower</b> was performing both <b>tower</b> and radar duties. On August 30, 2006, the FAA announced that Lexington, as well as other airports with similar traffic levels, would be staffed with two controllers in the <b>tower</b> around the clock effective immediately.|$|E
25|$|Round <b>towers</b> – The use {{of round}} <b>towers</b> as wall <b>towers</b> is {{probably}} contemporary with rectangle <b>towers</b> {{and may be}} mixed with rectangle <b>towers</b> as at St Pölten. There are many 'stadt' with right angle corners to the walls where round <b>towers</b> are used.|$|R

50|$|Wall <b>towers,</b> {{also known}} as mural <b>towers,</b> provide {{flanking}} fire (from crossbows or other projectile weapons) to a straight part of the curtain wall. Corner <b>towers</b> enfilade the two adjoining wall faces. If corner <b>towers</b> are far apart, additional flanking <b>towers</b> may be added between them. <b>Towers</b> in an outer curtain wall are often open at the back.|$|R

5|$|Manchester's skyline {{has been}} built up mostly over recent years. The CIS <b>Tower</b> kept the title of tallest {{building}} in Manchester for 44 years until the Beetham <b>Tower</b> was completed in 2006. The 169m tall Beetham <b>Tower</b> could lose the title should <b>Tower</b> 1 at Owen Street be completed.|$|E
5|$|Roseville <b>Tower</b> was the {{interlocking}} <b>tower</b> at street-level in Roseville that {{handled the}} nearby {{fork of the}} three lines (Montclair, Morristown and Gladstone). The <b>tower</b> was used on limited services, with only three different shifts, two of which were manned. The <b>tower</b> was run from 5 a.m. {{in the morning to}} 10 p.m. in the evening manned. The rest of the time, the <b>tower</b> was set on automatic.|$|E

5|$|The {{relevance}} of Strype's {{reference to the}} <b>Tower</b> was more than geographical. The East End was the major part of an area called the <b>Tower</b> Division, which had {{its roots in the}} Bishop of London's historic Manor of Stepney and owed military service to the <b>Tower</b> of London. Later, as the East End grew and the <b>Tower</b> Division contracted, the East End became, arguably, conterminous with the <b>Tower</b> Division.|$|E

50|$|Watch <b>towers</b> are {{observation}} <b>towers,</b> {{on which}} persons supervise a larger area. Strictly speaking, control <b>towers</b> also {{fall into this}} category, although surveillance from these structures is mostly done in a non-optical way using Radar. Watch <b>towers</b> usually have a closed pulpit to protect the observer against bad weather. Watch <b>towers</b> {{do not have an}} elevator as a rule, since these buildings are mostly not higher than 20 metres. Active watch <b>towers</b> are not as a rule accessible to the public, since they usually serve for the monitoring of sensitive ranges. However watch <b>towers</b> can be quite ordered for forest fire monitoring a platform accessible for the public or be used during times without forest fire risk as observation <b>towers.</b> Shut down watch <b>towers</b> can however be easily converted to observation <b>towers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Aermotor Company, {{originally}} of Chicago IL, was {{the first}} and lead manufacturer of steel fire <b>towers</b> from the nineteen-teens to the mid-twenties. These <b>towers</b> have very small cabs, because the <b>towers</b> are based upon Aermotor windmill <b>towers.</b> These <b>towers</b> are often found in the U.S. Midwest or the South, but few have made their way into the mountainous West. In the northeast, all of the <b>towers</b> in the Adirondack Mountains and most in the Catskills were Aermotor <b>towers</b> erected between 1916 and 1921.|$|R

Dayton is the site of five skyscrapers that rise at least 328ft (100m) in height. The most recently completed high-rise in the city is the Miami Valley Hospital Southeast <b>Tower,</b> which was constructed in 2010 and rises 246feet (75m).|$|E
5|$|A beer <b>tower</b> is a beer {{dispensing}} device, {{usually found}} in bars and pubs, {{that consists of}} a cylinder attached to a beer cooling device at the bottom. Beer is dispensed from the beer <b>tower</b> into a drinking vessel.|$|E
50|$|The {{suspension}} <b>towers</b> have {{a single}} crossbar, carrying one conductor on a suspension insulator {{at each end of}} it.Two types of strainers are used: lattice <b>towers</b> similar to the suspension <b>towers,</b> but equipped with strainer insulators and of stronger design and much more often pole-type <b>towers</b> with a central pole supported by two diagonal bars. The latter <b>towers</b> carry only one conductor, and there are always 2 such <b>towers</b> close together.|$|R

5|$|A fire {{swept through}} Westminster in 1834, {{destroying}} {{most of the}} old palace, but the Jewel <b>Tower,</b> which was separated from the main fire and was positioned away from the prevailing wind, survived, along with its store of records from the House of Lords. Westminster was rebuilt, and in 1864 substantial changes were made at the tower: the Parliamentary records in the <b>tower</b> were moved to a fire-proof storage facility at the new Victoria Tower; 6–7 Old Palace Yard ceased {{to be used by}} the clerk as a house, and the kitchen in the ground floor of the <b>tower</b> was closed. Around this time, the <b>tower</b> began to be called the Jewel <b>Tower</b> once again, partially in the incorrect belief that it had held the Crown Jewels during the medieval period.|$|E
5|$|According to the Shenboo Atlas of 1933, in the 1930s {{most people}} lived within the {{perimeter}} of the Xi'an Wall but still {{there were a lot of}} unoccupied open areas. Among the visitors who came to see the Xian Wall were American captain (later general) Stilwell in 1922 and the Czech sinologist Jaroslav Průšek (1906–1980) in 1933. In 1983, the administration of the Xi'an municipality carried out more renovations and additions to the wall. At that time, the Yangmacheng <b>tower,</b> the Zhalou sluice <b>tower,</b> the Kuixinglou dipper <b>tower,</b> the Jiaolou corner <b>tower</b> and the Dilou defense <b>tower</b> were all refurbished; the crumbling parts of the rampart were changed into gates; and the moat was restored. In May 2005, all of Xi'an's ramparts were inter-connected.|$|E

500|$|Defensive <b>towers</b> {{were built}} around the city walls, and archaeological and {{historical}} evidence suggests that there were 24 of these. The <b>towers</b> had a generally uniform appearance, with 16 half-circular, or [...] "horse-shoe", hollow-backed <b>towers</b> and eight square <b>towers.</b> The horse-shoe <b>towers</b> followed a fashion that had been popular from around 1260 to 1390, making Canterbury's <b>towers</b> a late example of the trend. The square <b>towers</b> were a newer design, and were {{built around the}} turn of the 14th and 15th century by Thomas Chillenden of Christchurch Priory.|$|R

5|$|After the crash, the North <b>Tower</b> burned for 102minutes before {{collapsing}} at 10:28A.M. Although {{the impact}} itself caused extensive structural damage, the long-lasting fire ignited by jet fuel was {{blamed for the}} structural failure of the <b>tower.</b> In addition to the aircraft passengers and building occupants, hundreds of rescue workers also died when the <b>tower</b> collapsed.

5|$|All the WindSeekers have {{speakers}} {{mounted to}} the inside of the gondola structure. They play 18 different tracks, among which are Hedwig's theme from the Harry Potter films, the theme songs from E.T., , and Superman, and songs from Flight of the Valkyries. At Cedar Point and Kings Island, the WindSeeker sign changes colors during night operation. At Cedar Point, as the gondola makes its way up the <b>tower,</b> the LED lights at the top of the <b>tower</b> go out, making the <b>tower</b> invisible, though the LED lights on the gondola remains lit. When the gondola comes back down, the lights at the top of the <b>tower</b> come on again. At Canada's Wonderland, the LED lights at the top of the <b>tower</b> remain on throughout the cycle, keeping the <b>tower</b> visible at all times.|$|E
5|$|Although {{only one}} bomb {{fell on the}} <b>Tower</b> of London in the First World War (it landed harmlessly in the moat), the Second World War left a greater mark.
