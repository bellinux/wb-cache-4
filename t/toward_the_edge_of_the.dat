5|$|Pulveroboletus ravenelii {{produces}} an olive-grey to olive-brown spore print. Spores are elliptical to oval, smooth, and measure 8–10 by 4–5μm. The hyphal {{tissue in the}} hymenophore is inamyloid and bilateral, meaning it diverges downward from the flesh <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hymenophore, away from a central strand. The tubes have scattered cystidia on the walls (pleurocystidia) and abundant cystidia on the edges (cheilocystidia). The hyphae in the cap cuticle are arranged as an ixotrichodermium–long and typically multi-celled, with erect hyphae embedded in a gelatinous matrix. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E
25|$|But racial {{tensions}} worsened {{on the night}} of July 22–23. Initially, the night was quieter than previous nights. The police and National Guard largely deployed <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expanded patrol zone. Cleveland police made 72 arrests for public intoxication, which they said was about usual for a Friday night. There were far fewer fires set the night of July 22–23 (only 14), and only a few false alarms. Cleveland fire investigators determined that none of the fires had been caused by a firebomb, and no firefighters were harassed as they put out blazes.|$|E
500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Leccinum manzanitae are {{sometimes}} massive, occasionally reaching weights of several pounds. The cap is [...] in diameter, spherical to convex when young, and broadly convex to flattened or cushion-shaped (pulvinate). The {{surface of the}} cap is often shallowly to deeply pitted or reticulate, sticky, and covered with pressed-down hairs that are more conspicuous <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cap. Its color is dark red during all stages of development. The cap's flesh is [...] thick, white when first exposed, but slowly and irregularly changing to dark brownish-gray with no reddish intermediate state. The change in color upon bruising or injury is often more pronounced in young specimens.|$|E

50|$|Pulling down on {{the opener}} rope segment causes the master carriers, and <b>the</b> moving <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{curtains}} they support, to travel <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stage. As each master carrier travels through the channel, it collides with and collects the other carriers one-by-one. This growing group of carriers is pushed <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stage, causing the fabric to bunch near <b>the</b> curtain's moving <b>edge.</b>|$|R

500|$|In 1952, Nurmi {{was persuaded}} by Urho Kekkonen, Prime Minister of Finland and former {{chairman}} of the Finnish Athletics Federation, to carry the Olympic torch into the Olympic Stadium at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. His appearance astonished the spectators, and Sports Illustrated wrote that [...] "his celebrated stride was unmistakable to the crowd. When he came into view, waves of sound began to build throughout the stadium, rising to a roar, then to a thunder. When the national teams, assembled in formation on the infield, saw the flowing figure of Nurmi, they broke ranks like excited schoolchildren, dashing <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> track." [...] After lighting the flame in the Olympic Cauldron, Nurmi passed the torch to his idol Kolehmainen, who lighted the beacon in the tower. In the cancelled 1940 Summer Olympics, Nurmi had been planned to lead a group of fifty Finnish gold medal winners.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the ship}} was not damaged by Japanese forces, the Monterey {{was one of several}} ships damaged by the typhoon that hit Admiral William Halsey's Third Fleet on December 18–19, 1944. The Third Fleet lost three destroyers and over 800 men during the typhoon. The Monterey was damaged by a fire, which was started by several of the ship's {{aircraft}} tearing loose from their cables and colliding on the hangar deck. During the storm, Ford narrowly avoided becoming a casualty himself. As he was going to his battle station on the bridge of the ship in the early morning of December 18, the ship rolled twenty-five degrees, which caused Ford to lose his footing and slide <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deck. The two-inch steel ridge {{around the edge of the}} carrier slowed him enough so he could roll, and he twisted into the catwalk below the deck. As he later stated, [...] "I was lucky; I could have easily gone overboard." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{reverse of}} the seal {{on the left}} {{features}} a barren landscape dominated by an unfinished pyramid of 13 steps, topped by the Eye of Providence within a triangle. At {{the base of the}} pyramid are engraved the Roman numerals MDCCLXXVI (1776), the date of American independence from Britain. At the top of the seal stands a Latin phrase, [...] "ANNUIT COEPTIS," [...] meaning [...] "He favors our undertaking." [...] At the bottom of the seal is a semicircular banner proclaiming [...] "NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM" [...] meaning [...] "New Order of the Ages" [...] that is a reference to the new American era. To the left of this seal, a string of 13 pearls extends <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bill.|$|E

2500|$|Heavy rain {{during the}} night of 3–4 November {{triggered}} lahars with mixtures of water and rock debris cascading down the Kuning, Gendol, Woro, Boyong, Krasak and Opak Rivers {{on the slopes of}} the volcano. A bridge was destroyed and riverbanks damaged. The eruption at 05:55 was reported as being five times stronger than the initial eruption on 26 October 2010. On 4 November Merapi had been erupting for 24 hours without stopping. Pyroclastic flows of [...] spread as far as [...] from the crater reaching <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> then [...] exclusion zone, and lava flowed into the mountain's rivers. Herry Bakti Gumay, Director General of air transportation, stated on 4 November that the warning released to all airlines operating flights into Yogyakarta would not be withdrawn until conditions returned to normal.|$|E
2500|$|The obverse of {{the seal}} {{on the right}} {{features}} a bald eagle, the national bird and symbol of the United States. Above the eagle is a radiant cluster of 13 stars arranged in a six-pointed star. The eagle's breast is covered by a heraldic shield with 13 stripes that resemble those on the American flag. As on the first US flag, {{the stars and stripes}} stand for the 13 original states of the union. The eagle holds a ribbon in its beak reading [...] "E PLURIBUS UNUM," [...] a Latin phrase meaning [...] "Out of many , one ," [...] a de facto motto of the United States (and the only one until 1956). In its left talons the eagle holds 13 arrows, and in its right talons it holds an olive branch with 13 leaves and 13 olives, representing, respectively, the powers of war and peace. To the right of this seal, a string of 13 pearls extends <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bill. [...] A plate position (check) number is normally found {{to the left of the}} eagle.|$|E

50|$|The lens is {{very sharp}} from its maximum {{aperture}} of f/2, {{with only a}} slight fall-off in acuity <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frame. Distortion and chromatic aberration are all well controlled. However, the lens suffers from mild vignetting.|$|R
60|$|Straggling cedars on {{his left}} almost wholly {{obstructed}} Slone's view. Wildfire's ears and nose were pointed that way. Slone trotted him down <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> this cedar clump {{so that he could}} see beyond. Before he reached it, however, he saw something blue, moving, waving, lifting.|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} smaller side scenes <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main {{scene of the}} painting. As commentaries on the main subject, the symbols the painter used in these scenes tell their own story: the stag stands for lust, the magpie symbolizes the {{malicious}} gossip the two elders inflict on the innocent woman, and the ducks represent fidelity.|$|R
25|$|The stop {{determines whether}} the image will be vignetted. Larger stops {{can cause the}} {{intensity}} reaching the film or detector to fall off <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> picture, especially when, for off-axis points, a different stop becomes the aperture stop by virtue of cutting off more light than did the stop that was the aperture stop on the optic axis.|$|R

50|$|Generally, {{the optical}} {{transfer}} function depends on {{factors such as the}} spectrum and polarization of the emitted light and the position of the point source. E.g. the image contrast and resolution are typically optimal {{at the center of the}} image, and deteriorate <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field-of-view. When significant variation occurs, the {{optical transfer function}} may be calculated for a set of representative positions or colors.|$|R
50|$|Haplogroup I1-M253 (M253, M307, P30, P40) {{displays}} {{a very clear}} frequency gradient, with a peak frequency of approximately 35% among the populations of southern Norway, southwestern Sweden, and Denmark, and rapidly decreasing frequencies <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historically Germanic-influenced world.

60|$|When {{finally he}} crept {{cautiously}} out <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thicket, I watched him as eagerly {{as if all}} our troubles would be over in case we succeeded in attracting the attention {{of those in the}} fort, whereas, no matter how many of our friends might see the waving fringe, we would still be in the same danger of getting a bullet from the besiegers.|$|E
60|$|Satisfied, Tarzan {{turned and}} retraced his {{steps toward the}} summit of the kopje.

Then Werper, slipping stealthily from his hiding place, dropped into the somber darkness of the entrance and disappeared.|$|E
50|$|As {{early as}} 13 February, German {{intelligence}} services had deduced that the Soviets {{would seek to}} clear Pomerania before advancing on Berlin. The 2nd Army—defending a large and exposed sector running through Pomerania eastward <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> East Prussia at Elbing — sought permission to withdraw, but this was denied by Adolf Hitler. Grudziądz, on the Vistula, was surrounded on 18 February (the garrison, from the 83rd Infantry Division—finally surrendered the following month).|$|R
