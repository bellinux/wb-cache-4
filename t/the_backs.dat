5|$|The bee-eaters {{are almost}} {{exclusively}} aerial hunters of insect prey. Prey is caught either in continuous flight or more commonly from an exposed perch {{from which the}} bee-eater watches for prey. Smaller, rounder-winged bee-eaters typically hunt from branches and twigs closer to the ground, whereas the larger species hunt from tree tops or telegraph wires. One unusual technique often used by carmine bee-eaters is to ride on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> of bustards.|$|E

5|$|The young King Teuruarii's {{coronation}} {{was celebrated}} in the traditional fashion.

5|$|With smaller prey, such as {{monkeys and}} hares, the tiger bites the nape, often {{breaking}} the spinal cord, piercing the windpipe, or severing the jugular vein or common carotid artery. Though rarely observed, some tigers {{have been recorded}} to kill prey by swiping with their paws, which are powerful enough to smash the skulls of domestic cattle, and break <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> of sloth bears.|$|E
5|$|During {{the voyage}} to England the team {{conducted}} training drills on the ship's deck; for this the forwards were coached by Gallaher and fellow player Bill Cunningham, while Stead {{was in charge}} of <b>the</b> <b>backs.</b> Consequently, the services of the NZRFU-appointed coach Jimmy Duncan were not used; his appointment had caused opposition from many in the squad who believed his expertise was not required, and that an extra player should have been taken on tour instead. After a six-week voyage, the team arrived in Plymouth, England on 8September 1905.|$|E

5|$|Footballers {{generally}} wear identifying {{numbers on}} <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> of their shirts. Originally {{a team of}} players wore numbers from 1 to 11, corresponding roughly to their playing positions, but at the professional level this has generally been superseded by squad numbering, whereby each player in a squad is allocated a fixed number {{for the duration of}} a season. Professional clubs also usually display players' surnames or nicknames on their shirts, above (or, infrequently, below) their squad numbers.|$|E

Despite an unconvincing Welsh display, an enthusiastic crowd of 20,000 watched their country win the game {{and with it the}} title, decided by a single try from Bert Gould.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, trees produce {{wood with}} a wavy grain, greatly {{increasing}} the value for decorative veneers. The wood is a medium weight for a hardwood, weighing 630kg per cubic metre. It {{is a traditional}} wood for use in making <b>the</b> <b>backs,</b> necks and scrolls of violins. The wood is often marketed as rippled sycamore. Whistles {{can be made from}} straight twigs when the rising sap allows the bark to be separated, and these, and sycamore branches, are used in customs associated with early May in Cornwall. The wood is used for fuel, being easy to saw and to split with an axe, producing a hot flame and good embers when burnt.|$|E

The waves on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> are left-to-right, that is reverse of the waves on the front. Also, <b>the</b> <b>back</b> only has seven [...] "eggs" [...] in the egg-and-dart band (4th decorative band from the top), compared to eleven for the front. Lastly, the bottom pebble design is simpler on <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> with less pebbles being shown, and a small plinth or band visually supports them.|$|R
5|$|Pelicans swim {{well with}} their strong legs and their webbed feet. They rub <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> {{of their heads}} on their preen glands to pick up an oily secretion, which they {{transfer}} to their plumage to waterproof it. Holding their wings only loosely against their bodies, pelicans float with relatively little of their bodies below the water surface. They dissipate excess heat by gular flutter – rippling {{the skin of the}} throat and pouch with the bill open to promote evaporative cooling. They roost and loaf communally on beaches, sandbanks and in shallow water.|$|E
5|$|The flat {{backs of}} many of the colossal heads {{represented}} the flat bases of the monumental thrones from which they were reworked. Only four of the seventeen heartland heads do not have flattened backs, indicating the possibility that the majority were reworked monuments. Alternatively, <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> {{of many of}} these massive monuments may have been flattened to ease their transport, providing a stable form for hauling the monuments with ropes. Two heads from San Lorenzo have traces of niches that are characteristic of monumental Olmec thrones and so were definitely reworked from earlier monuments.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed chough's food {{consists}} {{largely of}} insects, spiders and other invertebrates {{taken from the}} ground, with ants probably being the most significant item. The Central Asian subspecies P. p. centralis will perch on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> of wild or domesticated mammals to feed on parasites. Although invertebrates make {{up most of the}} chough's diet, it will eat vegetable matter including fallen grain, and in the Himalayas has been reported as damaging barley crops by breaking off the ripening heads to extract the corn. In the Himalayas, they form large flocks in winter.|$|E

5|$|According to {{a legend}} {{recorded}} in the Greek hagiography, Jovan Vladimir built the church near Elbasan. Its location, deep in a dense forest, was chosen by God, and an eagle with a shining cross on its head showed it to Vladimir. After the saint was decapitated, he brought {{his head to the}} church, and was buried inside. A group of Franks once stole the casket with his miraculous relics. The casket turned out to be extremely heavy, breaking <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> of hinnies on which the Franks carried it. They eventually put it in the Shkumbin River {{to take it to the}} sea, but the river flooded, and the casket—radiating light—went back upstream toward the church. The inhabitants of that area took it out of the water and returned it to the church in a festive procession.|$|E
5|$|Amphibian skin is {{permeable}} to water. Gas exchange {{can take}} place through the skin (cutaneous respiration) and this allows adult amphibians to respire without rising {{to the surface of}} water and to hibernate at the bottom of ponds. To compensate for their thin and delicate skin, amphibians have evolved mucous glands, principally on their heads, backs and tails. The secretions produced by these help keep the skin moist. In addition, most species of amphibian have granular glands that secrete distasteful or poisonous substances. Some amphibian toxins can be lethal to humans while others have little effect. The main poison-producing glands, the paratoids, produce the neurotoxin bufotoxin and are located behind the ears of toads, along <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> of frogs, behind the eyes of salamanders and on the upper surface of caecilians.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{takes place}} {{mostly on the}} ground in open areas and to some extent in trees. Landfill sites, bins, streets, and gardens are also visited, more often early in the morning when there are fewer people about. Various feeding methods are employed, such as jumping, pecking, clod-turning and scattering, probing the soil, and occasionally, digging. Flies around cow pats are caught by jumping from the ground or at times by {{dropping}} vertically from a few metres onto the cow pat. Earthworms are not usually extracted from the ground by western jackdaws but are eaten from freshly ploughed soil. Jackdaws will ride on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> of sheep and other mammals, seeking ticks as well as actively gathering wool or hair for nests, and will catch flying ants in flight. Compared with other corvids, the western jackdaw spends more time exploring and turning over objects with its bill; it also has a straighter and less downturned bill and increased binocular vision which are advantageous for this foraging strategy.|$|E
