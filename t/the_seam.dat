5|$|During {{the early}} 17th century coal was largely {{obtained}} by excavating the outcrops and driving drifts which followed <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> into the ground. Only {{small amounts of}} coal could be obtained by these methods and bell pits were also dug. These were vertical pits, with a 4feet (1.2m) diameter shaft up to 60feet (18.3m) deep, which were opened out at the bottom. When all the coal that could safely be extracted from the pit had been recovered, another pit was sunk close by to intersect <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> and the waste from the second pit thrown into the first.|$|E
5|$|In coal seams, coal {{balls are}} {{completely}} surrounded by coal. They are often found randomly scattered throughout <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> in isolated groups, {{usually in the}} upper half of <b>the</b> <b>seam.</b> Their occurrence in coal seams can be either extremely sporadic or regular; many coal seams have been found to contain no coal balls, while others have been found to contain so many coal balls that miners avoid the area entirely.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th century, the regiment, {{in common}} with other Yeomanry and Militia units, sported a range of uniforms. Jackets were always dark blue. Between 1812 and 1873, a leather shako was worn, {{replaced}} in 1873 by a fur Busby with a red cloth bag. Service dress during the First World War was a khaki tunic and breeches, with a red stripe down <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> and a red lanyard worn by all ranks round the left armpit. The chevrons of sergeants and corporals were surmounted by a regimental badge on a red baize backing, a practice that continued through the inter-war years and beyond.|$|E
5|$|In the Tests, Yardley's only scores over fifty, {{his first}} in Test cricket, {{came in the}} third Test, where he scored 61 and 53 not out. In England's first innings, he helped his side to recover from a batting collapse, {{surviving}} for two hours. His second innings lasted 89 minutes and helped England to avoid defeat {{for the first time}} in the series. In the same match, Yardley bowled more overs than he had done previously on the whole tour, following injuries to Bill Voce and Bill Edrich, two of England's main bowlers. Bowling leg theory with a fielders concentrated on the leg side, Yardley managed to move the ball off <b>the</b> <b>seam.</b> He dismissed Bradman twice in the match, having figures of three for 67 in the second innings and taking five wickets in the match. This was the first time that an England player had scored fifty runs in both innings and taken five wickets in a Test. Yardley also had substantial bowling workload in the fourth Test, delivering 31 overs in Australia's first innings to take three for 101. When Hammond did not play in the final Test, Yardley became captain, doing so courageously according to Wisden, which also pointed out that Yardley used field placing more effectively than Hammond. In the series, Yardley scored 252 runs at an average of 32.50, His ten wickets at an average of 37.20 placed him first in the series bowling averages. He played in the drawn Test on the short tour to New Zealand which followed, opening the batting scoring 22 and taking a wicket.|$|E
5|$|Toshack {{returned}} as the Australians travelled to London to play Surrey at The Oval, {{and he had}} his first outing with the bat on English soil, coming in last and scoring eight to help wicket-keeper Don Tallon add 33 for the final wicket before Australia were bowled out for 632. Toshack bowled without success in the first innings and took one wicket in the second innings, that of Arthur McIntyre, to end with match figures of 1/54 as Surrey were defeated by an innings. Toshack then took 2/32 in the first innings against Cambridge University, and did not bat as Australia declared at 4/414. He then took 0/9 from eight overs in the second innings, as Australia completed another innings victory. He then played in the match against Essex where Australia made 721runs on the first day to set a new world record for the most runs scored in a day of first-class cricket. However, Toshack only contributed four runs batting at No. 11. In the first innings, Toshack took the last five wickets to fall, including the top-scorer Ray Smith for 25, ending with 5/31 from 10.5 overs as the hosts capitulated for 83, unable to cope with his swing. Australia enforced the follow on and Toshack took a further 2/50 in the second innings as Australia won by an innings and 451 runs, the largest margin of the tour. He then faced Oxford University, scoring two runs in Australia's 431. Toshack then took three lower order wickets in the first innings to end with 3/34 from 22 overs, sending down more overs than any other Australian. He took 3/37 in the second innings as Australia completed another innings victory after enforcing the follow on. The Oxford batsmen had trouble with <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> movement of Toshack.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} achieve this effect, a seam bowler usually {{delivers}} the ball with <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> held upright, with rotation about a horizontal axis. This keeps <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> aligned vertically as it travels towards the batsman, making it likely that the ball will bounce with <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> on the pitch. Of course, consistently hitting <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> is {{not as easy as}} it sounds. <b>The</b> <b>seam</b> has to be held upright between the index finger and the middle finger {{at the time of the}} delivery of the ball and, most importantly, the wrist has to be dead straight when the ball is delivered. <b>The</b> <b>seam</b> and wrist position of Australia's Glenn McGrath are arguably a perfect example.|$|E
25|$|The {{calling card}} of this delivery, for the batsman {{to read it}} in advance, is the typical wobble in <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> after ball release with <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> {{slanting}} predominantly towards the batsman. A simple way for a beginner to learn to bowl cutters is to try imparting strong back-spin to the ball by pulling down on <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> {{at the time of}} release while keeping <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> vertical.|$|E
25|$|A cricket ball is not {{a perfect}} sphere. <b>The</b> <b>seam</b> of the ball is the {{circular}} stitching which joins {{the two halves of}} the cricket ball. Hence, <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> joining the pieces of leather is circumferential and the stitching is noticeably raised. If the ball is bowled {{in such a way that}} <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> hits the pitch when it bounces, this irregularity can cause the ball to deviate sideways in its path. It may move in any direction, or just go straight. The batsman has to see how the ball moves after pitching to select his shot.|$|E

50|$|In 1901 mining recommenced in <b>the</b> Victoria Tunnel <b>seam</b> {{which was}} located above <b>the</b> Borehole <b>seam.</b> Both <b>the</b> Borehole & Victoria Tunnel seams were then worked until 1906 when working of <b>the</b> Borehole <b>seam</b> ceased. <b>The</b> Borehole <b>seam</b> {{workings}} were abandoned in 1912 and the fan at the Flaggy Creek shaft was stopped as this shaft only served <b>the</b> Borehole <b>seam</b> workings.|$|R
25|$|The Möbius strip {{has several}} curious properties. A line drawn {{starting}} from <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> {{down the middle}} meets back at <b>the</b> <b>seam,</b> but at the other side. If continued, the line meets the starting point, and is double {{the length of the}} original strip. This single continuous curve demonstrates that the Möbius strip has only one boundary.|$|E
25|$|Seam {{deliveries}} can be bowled at any pace, {{but most}} specialist seamers bowl at medium, medium-fast or fast-medium pace. The basic technique of seam bowling is {{to employ the}} normal fast bowling or slower ball grip {{and to try to}} ensure that <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> remains upright until the ball hits the pitch. If <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> is upright and the ball is spinning around its horizontal axis, there is no appreciable Magnus effect and the ball will not move in the air. <b>The</b> <b>seam</b> of the ball is raised and will cause variations in bounce and movement if it is {{the first part of the}} ball to hit the pitch.|$|E
25|$|Swing is {{produced}} {{due to a}} net force acting on the ball from one side; that is, the side with the more turbulent boundary layer. For conventional swing bowling, the raised seam and the direction it points governs the direction of swing. Due to the angled seam of the ball, air flowing over <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> produces turbulence on the side that <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> is angled toward. This causes the boundary layer to separate {{from the surface of}} the ball later (farther toward the rear of the ball) than the other side where it separates earlier (farther forward on the surface). As explained by Bernoulli's principle, there is a net pressure differential due to the greater pressure on the side with the more intact boundary layer. The resulting net force acts so as to move or swing the ball in the direction of the angled seam. Conventional swing bowling is delivered with <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> angled such that the smooth or polished side of the ball faces forward to move the ball in the direction of <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> i.e. toward the rough side.|$|E

25|$|In reverse swing <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> is angled in {{the same}} way as in {{conventional}} swing (10–20 degrees to one side) but the boundary layer on both sides is turbulent. The net effect of <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> and rough side is that the ball swings in the direction opposite to where <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> is pointing to. The turbulent boundary layer separating later is similar to the effect produced by dimples in a golf ball. In case of the golf ball, turbulence is produced on both sides of the ball and the net effect is a later separation of boundary layer on both sides and smaller wake in the back of the ball and a lower net drag due to pressure differential between the front and the back – this enables the golf ball to travel farther.|$|E

25|$|A cutter is a fast {{ball that}} is spinning, that is, a {{delivery}} that is rotating around the opposite axis to <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> instead of keeping <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> straight. While this rotation {{is nowhere near}} as much as that achieved by a spin bowler, the small variations it can produce are still {{enough to make a}} batsman uncomfortable due to the speed of the ball.

25|$|The {{etymology}} of {{the word}} ogam or ogham remains unclear. One possible origin is from the Irish og-úaim 'point-seam', referring to <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> made by {{the point of a}} sharp weapon.|$|E
25|$|The {{first thing}} a fast bowler {{needs to do}} is to grip the ball correctly. The basic fast bowling grip to achieve maximum speed is to hold the ball with <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> upright and to place the index and middle fingers close {{together}} at the top of <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> with the thumb gripping the ball at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>seam.</b> The image to the right shows the correct grip. The first two fingers and the thumb should hold the ball forward {{of the rest of the}} hand, and the other two fingers should be tucked into the palm. The ball is held quite loosely so that it leaves the hand easily. Other grips are possible, and result in different balls – see swing and seam bowling below. The bowler usually holds their other hand over the hand gripping the ball until the latest possible moment so that the batsman cannot see what type of ball is being bowled.|$|E
