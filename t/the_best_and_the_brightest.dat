The party established its own English-language paper, The National Socialist, in May 1878 but managed to keep the publication alive only one year. The year 1878 saw the establishment of a more enduring newspaper: the German-language New Yorker Volkszeitung (New York People's News). The Volkszeitung included material by <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> of the German-American socialist movement, including Alexander Jonas, Adolph Douai, and Sergei Shevitch, and Herman Schlüter and quickly emerged as the leading voice of the SLP during the last decades of the 19th century.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} the internal dimensions of Word-of-Mouth (WOM) behavior, comparing <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> worst Brazilian e-tail websites in four dimensions: intensity, positive valence, negative valence <b>and</b> content. <b>The</b> research used for this paper {{is based on the}} multidimensional framework of Goyette, Ricard, Bergeron, and Marticotte (2010). It suggests that WOM intensity is higher in the case of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> websites, while <b>the</b> degree of promotion (positive valence) of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> websites is lower than the degree of detraction (negative valence) of the worst websites. This result supports previous findings, showing that negative WOM is passionate and extreme. Yet, elements such as trust, delivery time and post-purchase support, reinforce both positive WOM in <b>the</b> <b>best</b> websites <b>and</b> negative WOM in the worst websites. However, security of transaction and ease of use do not reinforce negative WOM in the worst websites, suggesting a certain degree of commoditization of such factors between <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> worst websites...|$|R
