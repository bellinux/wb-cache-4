5|$|Suspicion quickly fell on al-Qaeda. The United States {{responded by}} {{launching}} the War on Terror and invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban, which had harbored al-Qaeda. Many countries strengthened their anti-terrorism legislation and expanded {{the powers of}} law enforcement and intelligence agencies to prevent terrorist attacks. Although al-Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, initially denied any involvement, in 2004 he {{claimed responsibility for the}} attacks. Al-Qaeda and bin Laden cited U.S. support of Israel, the presence of U.S. <b>troops</b> <b>in</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia,</b> and sanctions against Iraq as motives. After evading capture for almost a decade, Osama bin Laden was located and killed by SEAL Team Six of the U.S. Navy in May 2011.|$|E

500|$|In {{a second}} fatwā in 1998, bin Laden {{outlined}} his objections to American foreign policy {{with respect to}} Israel, {{as well as the}} continued presence of American <b>troops</b> <b>in</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> after the Gulf War. Bin Laden used Islamic texts to exhort Muslims to attack Americans until the stated grievances are reversed. Muslim legal scholars [...] "have throughout Islamic history unanimously agreed that the jihad is an individual duty if the enemy destroys the Muslim countries", according to bin Laden.|$|E
500|$|On February 23, 1998, Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, {{and three}} other leaders of Islamic militant {{organizations}} issued a fatwa {{in the name of}} the World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders, publishing it in Al-Quds Al-Arabi. Deploring the stationing of U.S. <b>troops</b> <b>in</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia,</b> the alleged U.S. aim to fragment Iraq, and U.S. support for Israel, they declared that [...] "The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies — civilian and military — is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it." [...] In spring 1998, Saudi elites became concerned about the threat posed by al-Qaeda and bin Laden; militants attempted to infiltrate surface-to-air missiles inside the kingdom, an al-Qaeda defector alleged that Saudis were bankrolling bin Laden, and bin Laden himself lambasted the Saudi royal family. In June 1998, Al Mukhabarat Al A'amah (Saudi intelligence) director Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud traveled to Tarnak Farms to meet with Taliban leader Mullah Omar to discuss the question of bin Laden. Turki demanded that the Taliban either expel bin Laden from Afghanistan or hand him over to the Saudis, insisting that removing bin Laden was the price of cordial relations with the Kingdom. American analysts believed Turki offered a large amount of financial aid to resolve the dispute over bin Laden. Omar agreed to the deal, and the Saudis sent the Taliban 400 pickup trucks and funding, enabling the Taliban to retake Mazar-i-Sharif. While the Taliban sent a delegation to Saudi Arabia in July for further discussions, the negotiations stalled by August.|$|E
2500|$|This {{was one of}} {{the stated}} motivations behind the September 11th {{terrorist}} attacks, as well as the Khobar Towers bombing. Bin Laden interpreted the Islamic prophet, Muhammad as banning the [...] "permanent presence of infidels in Arabia". U.S. <b>troops</b> <b>in</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> served to provoke skirmishes between Iraq and the United States between both Persian Gulf Wars.|$|E

5000|$|As a {{consequence}} of the policy, the U.S. had to station large number of troops nearby. <b>Troops</b> were stationed <b>in</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia,</b> an area that many in the region regard as [...] "holy soil," [...] which offended many locals and is cited by Osama bin Laden as one reason for his hatred against the United States policies and part of his motivation for the September 11 attacks.|$|R

2500|$|Social {{identity}} {{is explained by}} Karina Korostelina as a [...] "feeling of belonging to a social group, as a strong connection with social category, and as {{an important part of}} our mind that affects our social perceptions and behavior" [...] This definition {{can be applied to the}} case of Osama bin Laden, who, according to this theory, had a highly salient perception of his social identity as a Muslim, a strong connection to the social category of the Muslim Ummah or 'community,' which affect his social perceptions and behaviors. Bin Laden's ideology and interpretation of Islam led to the creation of al-Qaeda in response to perceived threats against the Muslim community by the Soviet Union, the U.S. in particular due to its <b>troop</b> presence <b>in</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia,</b> and American support for Israel. The Islamist terrorist group al-Qaeda has a group identity, which includes [...] "shared experiences, attitudes, beliefs, and interests of in-group members", and is [...] "described through the achievement of a collective aim for which this group has been created", which in this case is to achieve [...] "a complete break from the foreign influences in Muslim countries, and the creation of a new Islamic caliphate".|$|R
50|$|The bombings {{have been}} {{attributed}} to Islamic extremists as part of a campaign against Westerners and Westernization in Saudi Arabia. They are thought to have been sparked by the stationing of US <b>troops</b> <b>in</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> during the 1991 Gulf War with Iraq.|$|E

5000|$|On 12 August 1990, Saddam [...] "proposed {{that all}} cases of occupation, and those {{cases that have}} been portrayed as occupation, in the region, be {{resolved}} simultaneously".

[...] He also called for a replacement of US <b>troops</b> that mobilized <b>in</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> <b>in</b> response to Kuwait's invasion with [...] "an Arab force", {{as long as that}} force did not involve Egypt. Additionally, he requested an [...] "immediate freeze of all boycott and siege decisions" [...] and a general normalization of relations with Iraq.

5|$|From his {{headquarters}} in Tampa, Schwarzkopf began planning the operations to defend <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia.</b> Lieutenant General Charles Horner, USAF, ran the headquarters in Riyadh. Schwarzkopf planned supply lines for the 50,000 troops initially sent to <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia,</b> tapping Major General William G. Pagonis {{as director of}} the logistical operations, with U.S. Air Force cargo aircraft landing supplies at Dhahran and U.S. Navy ships offloading troops and supplies at Dammam. By August 20, 20,000 U.S. <b>troops</b> were <b>in</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia,</b> with another 80,000 preparing to deploy, and a further 40,000 reserves tapped to augment them. Schwarzkopf arrived at the CENTCOM command in Riyadh on August 25, and on August 29 he conducted his first front-line tour of the potential combat zone, accompanied by reporters. Over the next several weeks, Schwarzkopf spoke frequently with both reporters and troops under his command, conducting many high-profile press conferences and updates to the situation <b>in</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia.</b> Schwarzkopf worked to help coordinate the contributions of the different nations contributing military forces to the effort. By mid-October, Schwarzkopf indicated he was confident the forces were of a sufficient level that they could defend <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> if it was attacked. Through October, Schwarzkopf and his command were occupied with setting up facilities and supply lines for the troops streaming into <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia.</b> He also worked to minimize the culture clash among foreigners <b>in</b> sharia-dominated <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia,</b> such as the high visibility of women in military roles. Schwarzkopf remained at his command in Riyadh through December, making frequent frontline visits to the troops. On December 29, 1990, he received a warning order from The Pentagon to be ready to attack into Iraq and Kuwait by January 17.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether respiratory disease due to crowded living conditions and high levels of suspended and blowing sand had a major adverse impact on US military personnel during Operation Desert Shield. METHODS. A questionnaire survey was administered to 2598 combat <b>troops</b> stationed <b>in</b> Northeast <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> for a mean of 102 days. Samples of surface sand from seven different locations were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction. RESULTS. Among surveyed troops, 34. 4 % reported a sore throat, 43. 1 % complained of a cough, 15. 4 % complained of chronic rhinorrhea, and 1. 8 % were unable to perform their routine duties because of upper respiratory symptoms. Evaluation of sleeping accommodations indicated that complaints of a sore throat and cough were most closely associated with sleeping in air-conditioned buildings; in contrast, complaints of rhinorrhea were associated with exposure to the outdoor environment while living in tents. Sand samples consisted mostly of quartz, with just 0. 21 % by weight of respirable size (< 10 microns in diameter). CONCLUSIONS. These findings indicate that upper respiratory complaints were frequent among Operation Desert Shield troops and were related both to the troops' housing and to their exposure to the outside environment...|$|R
