50|$|From 1923 to 1928 the Brisbane City Council {{implemented}} {{its most}} ambitious <b>town</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>scheme</b> to that date: the widening of Adelaide Street by 14 feet along its entire length. Resumptions in Adelaide Street had commenced in the 1910s, but {{work on the}} street widening {{did not take place}} until the 1920s. The work was undertaken in stages, commencing in 1923 at the southern end where the new Brisbane City Hall was under construction. Some buildings had the front section removed and a contemporary facade installed on the new road alignment. Elsewhere, earlier buildings were demolished and substantial new structures took their place. At the northern end of Adelaide Street the cutting down of the hill below St John's Cathedral in 1928 facilitated greater access to Petrie Bight, which, close to new city wharves at the end of Boundary Street, boomed in the 1920s as a warehousing district.|$|E

50|$|Under the {{provisions}} of the City of Brisbane Improvement Act 1916 and the Local Authorities Act Amendment Act 1923 the Brisbane City Council contributed significantly to the 1920s building boom, with a programme of city beautification and street improvements, including the cutting down and widening of several of the principal thoroughfares.

50|$|The A63 {{meets the}} A1079 (for central Hull) at a junction, beyond which {{the road is}} named Castle Street. The Castle Street section of the road (2011) had {{significant}} air pollution problems (NO2 levels), with over 55,000 vehicles per day, and had heavy congestion, having been at full capacity for around a decade; much of the traffic is heavy goods vehicles originating {{as a result of}} Ro-Ro activity at Hull Docks. The road section also was experiencing high accident levels, as well as forming a barrier to local north-south movement within the <b>town</b> centre. <b>Improvement</b> <b>schemes</b> for the road had been planned since the 1980s, but were subject to funding delays.|$|R
5|$|This was {{followed}} by the Sheffield and Rotherham Railway in 1838, the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway in 1845, and the Midland Railway in 1870. The Sheffield Tramway was started in 1873 with the construction of a horse tram route from Lady's Bridge to Attercliffe. This route was later extended to Brightside and Tinsley, and further routes were constructed to Hillsborough, Heeley, and Nether Edge. Due to the narrow medieval roads the tramways were initially banned from the <b>town</b> centre. An <b>improvement</b> <b>scheme</b> was passed in 1875; Pinstone Street and Leopold Street were constructed by 1879, and Fargate was widened in the 1880s. The 1875 plan also called for the widening of the High Street; disputes with property owners delayed this until 1895.|$|R
25|$|The {{opening of}} the Sheffield Canal in 1819 opened Sheffield to the {{large-scale}} transportation of freight. This {{was followed by the}} Sheffield and Rotherham Railway in 1838, with Sheffield's first railway station opening at the Wicker. The first main line railway station in Sheffield was opened in 1845 at Bridgehouses by the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway. This line was extended to a new station, Sheffield Victoria Station in 1851, and Wicker station was replaced by Sheffield Midland station in 1870. A horse tramway opened from Lady's Bridge to Attercliffe in 1873, this was later extended to Brightside and Tinsley. Further horse tramway routes were constructed to Hillsborough, Heeley, and Nether Edge. There was an unsuccessful trial of Steam trams in 1877 and 1878.
