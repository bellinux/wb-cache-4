25|$|More {{accurate}} {{methods for}} determining the preload rely on defining or measuring the screw extension from the nut. Alternatively, measurement of the angular rotation of the nut can {{serve as the basis}} for defining screw extension based on the fastener's <b>thread</b> <b>pitch.</b> Measuring the screw extension directly allows the clamping force to be very accurately calculated. This can be achieved using a dial test indicator, reading deflection at the fastener tail, using a strain gauge, or ultrasonic length measurement.|$|E

50|$|The British Standard Cycle (BSC) {{standard}} which {{replaced the}} Cycle Engineers' Institute (CEI) standard was used on British bicycles and motorcycles. It uses a thread angle of 60° {{compared to the}} Whitworth 55° and very fine <b>thread</b> <b>pitches.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Another {{variant of}} form-milling {{involves}} holding the cutter's axis orthogonally (no canting to the thread's helix angle) and feeding the cutter in a toolpath that will generate the thread. The part {{is usually a}} stationary workpiece, such as a boss on a valve body (in external thread milling) or a hole in a plate or block (in internal thread milling). This type of thread milling uses essentially the same concept as contouring with an endmill or ball-nose mill, but the cutter and toolpath are arranged specifically to define the [...] "contour" [...] of a thread. The toolpath is achieved either using helical interpolation (which is circular interpolation in one plane [...] with simultaneous linear interpolation along a third axis the CNC control model must be one that supports using the third axis) or a simulation of it using extremely small increments of 3-axes linear interpolation (which is not practical to program manually but can be programmed easily with CAD/CAM software). The cutter geometry reflects the <b>thread</b> <b>pitch</b> but not its lead; the lead (thread helix angle) {{is determined by the}} toolpath. Tapered threads can be cut either with a tapered multiple-form cutter that completes the thread in one revolution using helical interpolation, or with a straight or tapered cutter (of single- or multiple-form) whose toolpath is one or more revolutions but cannot use helical interpolation and must use CAD/CAM software to generate a contour-like simulation of helical interpolation.|$|E

5000|$|American Unified Coarse was {{originally}} based on {{almost the same}} imperial fractions.

50|$|On {{manually}} controlled lathes, the <b>thread</b> <b>pitches</b> {{that can}} be cut are, in some ways, determined by the pitch of the lead-screw: A lathe with a metric lead-screw will readily cut metric threads (including BA), while one with an imperial lead-screw will readily cut imperial-unit-based threads such as BSW or UTS (UNF, UNC). This limitation is not insurmountable, because a 127-tooth gear, called a transposing gear, is used to translate between metric and inch <b>thread</b> <b>pitches.</b> However, this is optional equipment that many lathe owners do not own. It is also a larger change-wheel than the others, and on some lathes may be larger than the change-wheel mounting banjo is capable of mounting.|$|R

50|$|Many {{differential}} screw configurations are possible. The micrometer adjuster pictured uses a nut sleeve {{with different}} {{inner and outer}} <b>thread</b> <b>pitches</b> to connect a screw on the adjusting rod end with threads inside the main barrel; as the thimble rotates the nut sleeve, the rod and barrel move relative to each other based on the differential between the threads.|$|R

5000|$|Differential {{adjusters}} - These adjusters {{attain a}} smaller motion than possible from one thread alone {{by using the}} difference between the motions of two nuts moving simultaneously along two different <b>thread</b> <b>pitches</b> on one axle. There are many commercially available versions of these at prices from many times that of the fine threads and bushing alone. With this solution backlash is often a problem as backlash from the two threads combines additively.|$|R
50|$|American Unified Coarse was {{originally}} based on {{almost the same}} Imperial fractions. The Unified thread angle is 60° and has flattened crests (Whitworth crests are rounded).

50|$|<b>Thread</b> <b>pitch</b> gauges {{are used}} as a {{reference}} tool in determining the pitch of a thread that is on a screw or in a tapped hole. This tool is not used as a precision measuring instrument. This device allows the user to determine {{the profile of the}} given thread and quickly categorize the thread by shape and pitch. This device also saves time, in that it removes the need for the user to measure and calculate the <b>thread</b> <b>pitch</b> of the threaded item.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to coarse and fine threads, {{there is another}} division of extra fine, or “superfine” threads, with a very fine <b>pitch</b> <b>thread.</b> Superfine <b>pitch</b> metric <b>threads</b> are occasionally used in automotive components, such as suspension struts, and are commonly used in the aviation manufacturing industry. This is because extra fine threads are more resistant to coming loose from vibrations.|$|R
50|$|The Löwenherz thread {{was used}} {{extensively}} in measuring instruments (like micrometers, which achieve greater precision with finer <b>thread</b> <b>pitches)</b> and in shell manufacturing. It was also popular choice {{for use in}} optical instruments, especially in Germany. In addition to seeing its use in instruments designed in Germany, Austria and France, the Löwenhetz thread was once adopted by the Bureau of Standards in the United States {{as a solution to}} the lack of uniformity in the type of screws used in American-made instruments.|$|R
50|$|Manually {{controlled}} metalworking lathes {{are commonly}} {{provided with a}} variable-ratio gear-train to drive the main lead-screw. This enables different <b>thread</b> <b>pitches</b> to be cut. On some older lathes or more affordable new lathes, the gear trains are changed by swapping gears with various numbers of teeth onto or off of the shafts, while more modern or expensive manually controlled lathes have a quick-change box to provide commonly used ratios by the operation of a lever. CNC lathes use computers and servomechanisms to regulate the rates of movement.|$|R
5000|$|Knuckle threads {{with a flat}} 30 degree flank {{thread angle}} are {{standardized}} in DIN 405 for inch pitches and diameters ranging from 8mm to 200mm. [...] A more recent standard DIN 20400 uses metric <b>thread</b> <b>pitch</b> and lists diameters from 10mm to 300mm. [...] As DIN is a German organization, many instances of the DIN thread charts write numbers with a comma as the decimal point. For a <b>thread</b> <b>pitch</b> p, the crest and root rounding radius is slightly less than p/4, and approximately the middle third of each thread flank is flat.|$|E
5000|$|A {{screw-cutting}} lathe is {{a machine}} (specifically, a lathe) capable of cutting very accurate screw threads via single-point screw-cutting, {{which is the}} process of guiding the [...] motion of the tool bit in a precisely known ratio to the rotating motion of the workpiece. This is accomplished by gearing the leadscrew (which drives the tool bit's movement) to the spindle with a certain gear ratio for each <b>thread</b> <b>pitch.</b> Every degree of spindle rotation is matched by a certain distance of linear tool travel, depending on the desired <b>thread</b> <b>pitch</b> (English or metric, fine or coarse, etc.).|$|E

25|$|There {{are a few}} {{traditional}} standard shell widths (68, 70 or 73mm).

Some modern bicycles have shell widths of 83 or 100mm and these are for specialised downhill mountain biking or snowbiking applications. The shell width influences the Q factor or tread of the bike.

50|$|In American {{engineering}} drawings, ANSI Y14.6 defines {{standards for}} indicating threaded parts. Parts are indicated by their nominal diameter (the nominal major {{diameter of the}} screw <b>threads),</b> <b>pitch</b> (number of <b>threads</b> per inch), and the class of fit for the thread. For example, “.750-10UNC-2A” is male (A) with a nominal major diameter of 0.750 in, 10 threads per inch, and a class-2 fit; “.500-20UNF-1B” would be female (B) with a 0.500 in nominal major diameter, 20 threads per inch, and a class-1 fit.
