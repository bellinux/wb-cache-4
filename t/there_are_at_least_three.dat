5|$|Although <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>three</b> {{staging systems}} for cholangiocarcinoma (e.g. those of Bismuth, Blumgart, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer), none {{have been shown}} to be useful in {{predicting}} survival. The most important staging issue is whether the tumor can be surgically removed, or whether it is too advanced for surgical treatment to be successful. Often, this determination can only be made at the time of surgery.|$|E
5|$|The {{status of}} certain {{varieties}} in the Mongolic group—whether they are languages distinct from Mongolian or just dialects of it—is disputed. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>three</b> such varieties: Oirat (including the Kalmyk variety) and Buryat, {{both of which}} are spoken in Russia, Mongolia, and China; and Ordos, spoken around Inner Mongolia's Ordos City.|$|E
5|$|Long and slender, {{the blue}} whale's body can be various shades of bluish-grey dorsally and {{somewhat}} lighter underneath. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>three</b> distinct subspecies: B. m. musculus of the North Atlantic and North Pacific, B. m. intermedia of the Southern Ocean and B. m. brevicauda (also {{known as the}} pygmy blue whale) found in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean. B. m. indica, found in the Indian Ocean, may be another subspecies. As with other baleen whales, its diet consists almost exclusively of small crustaceans known as krill.|$|E

5|$|The {{surface of}} Thebe {{is dark and}} appears to be reddish in color. There is a {{substantial}} asymmetry between leading and trailing hemispheres: the leading hemisphere is 1.3times brighter than the trailing one. The asymmetry is probably caused by the higher velocity and frequency of impacts on the leading hemisphere, which excavate a bright material (probably ice) from the interior of the moon. The surface of Thebe is heavily cratered and it appears that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>three</b> or four impact craters that are very large, each being roughly comparable in size to Thebe itself.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} genetically {{discrete}} subpopulations {{have been identified}} across the northern range of the Pacific angelshark. Several subpopulations exist along the coast from Point Conception northward to Alaska. In the Southern California Bight, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>three</b> separate subpopulations off the mainland and northern and southern Channel Islands. The subpopulation along the Pacific coast of Baja California are distinct {{from those in the}} Gulf of California. These subpopulations have diverged from one another over time because Pacific angelsharks do not undertake long migratory movements outside of their preferred home areas, and deep waters serve as effective geographical barriers to population mixing. Heterozygosity, a measure of genetic diversity, is higher in the Pacific angelshark than in other shark species that have been examined.|$|E

25|$|The {{notion of}} {{causation}} is {{closely linked to}} the problem of induction. According to Hume, we reason inductively by associating constantly conjoined events. It is the mental act of association that is the basis of our concept of causation. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>three</b> interpretations of Hume's theory of causation represented in the literature: (1) the logical positivist; (2) the sceptical realist; and (3) the quasi-realist.|$|E
25|$|The Encke Gap is a 325-km-wide gap {{within the}} A Ring, {{centered}} {{at a distance}} of 133,590km from Saturn's center. It is caused by the presence of the small moon Pan, which orbits within it. Images from the Cassini probe have shown that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>three</b> thin, knotted ringlets within the gap. Spiral density waves visible on both sides of it are induced by resonances with nearby moons exterior to the rings, while Pan induces an additional set of spiraling wakes (see image in gallery).|$|E
25|$|The Dantu antigen was {{described}} in 1984. The Dantu antigen has an apparent molecular weight of 29 kiloDaltons (kDa) and 99 amino acids. The first 39 amino acids of the Dantu antigen are derived from glycophorin B and residues 40-99 are derived from glycophorin A. Dantu is associated with very weak s antigen, a protease-resistant N antigen and either very weak or no U antigen. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>three</b> variants: MD, NE and Ph. The Dantu phenotype occurs with a frequency of Dantu phenotype is ~0.005 in American Blacks and < 0.001 in Germans.|$|E

Because <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one non-prime between any two odd primes it would also imply Brocard's conjecture that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> four primes between the squares of consecutive odd primes.
