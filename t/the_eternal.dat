They {{are described as}} {{an offshoot of the}} evolutionary process that created sentient life on Earth. The original instigators of this process, the alien Celestials, intended <b>the</b> <b>Eternals</b> to be <b>the</b> defenders of Earth, which leads to the inevitability of war against their destructive counterparts, <b>the</b> Deviants. <b>The</b> <b>Eternals</b> were created by Jack Kirby and made their first appearance in <b>The</b> <b>Eternals</b> #1 (July 1976).|$|R

In the story, Kōhei is able to form intimate relationships with the six heroines: Mizuka Nagamori, Rumi Nanase, Misaki Kawana, Mio Kouzuki, Mayu Shiina, and Akane Satomura. While a given relationship will start out well, before long those around him start to forget him as he begins to retreat further into <b>the</b> <b>Eternal</b> World.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the events in Final Fantasy X, in Final Fantasy X-2 the teachings of Yevon were no longer deemed valid, and {{association}} with machina and the Al Bhed people no longer sacrilegious.

Yuna ultimately restores peace and saves Spira a second time with multiple endings based on the player's performance.|$|E

5|$|In Smith's view, the {{opportunity}} to achieve exaltation extended to all humanity; those who died with no opportunity to accept saving ordinances could achieve exaltation by accepting them in the afterlife through ordinances performed on their behalf.

Apart from those who committed <b>the</b> <b>eternal</b> sin, Smith taught that even the wicked and disbelieving would achieve a degree of glory in the afterlife.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known shrines {{appeared in}} Egypt {{in the late}} Predynastic Period, in the late fourth millenniumBC, at sites such as Sais and Buto in Lower Egypt and Nekhen and Coptos in Upper Egypt. Most of these shrines were made of perishable materials such as wood, reed matting, and mudbrick. Despite the impermanence of these early buildings, later Egyptian art continually reused and adapted elements from them, evoking the ancient shrines to suggest <b>the</b> <b>eternal</b> nature of the gods and their dwelling places.|$|E
5|$|The end of The Dry Salvages {{starts with}} a {{discussion}} about how people attempt to see the future through various superstitious means.

By acting properly, one would be able to overcome life and move towards the next world.|$|E
5000|$|However, Justice, who {{had been}} dealt with {{separately}} {{from the rest of}} the team, returned to the fight and freed his teammates, damaging the High Evolutionary's machine in the process. Justice then convinced the rest of <b>the</b> <b>Eternals</b> and <b>the</b> High Evolutionary that Zuras had indeed been lying. The leader of <b>the</b> <b>Eternals</b> is forced to admit the Celestials weren't coming, albeit blaming the attempted genocide entirely on the High Evolutionary with the excuse [...] "he had been tricked by him too". <b>The</b> <b>Eternals</b> leave, warned by the New Warriors not to come back.|$|R
5000|$|By this time, Sersi's fellow Eternals {{had become}} aware of her {{unstable}} nature, and had sent three of their kind, Ikaris, Arex, and Sprite, to New York in order to return her to Olympia. <b>The</b> <b>Eternals</b> feared Sersi was suffering from {{what they call the}} Mahd W'yry, a breakdown of the mind due to <b>the</b> <b>Eternals</b> extended lives. Sersi rejected their fears as archaic, and refused to accompany them back to her homeland. The Avengers also didn't want to let them take one of their members against her will, especially when they learned that if she was found to be suffering from the Mahd W'yry, <b>the</b> <b>Eternals</b> planned to 'cleanse' her of it by molecular discorporation which would cause death. The ensuing battle between the Avengers and <b>the</b> <b>Eternals</b> was contained only when Sprite, who had learned of Sersi's feelings for the Black Knight, insisted that the Knight be made her [...] "Gann Josin". This is a concept <b>the</b> <b>Eternals</b> use to describe an intimate joining of two minds as soulmates in their own personal Uni-Mind. Before this could be further discussed, however, Ikaris used his powers to cause it to happen. <b>The</b> <b>Eternals</b> departed, leaving Sersi behind. The Black Knight was less than enthusiastic at being used in this manner, for he had {{come to the conclusion that}} it was Crystal he loved, not Sersi.|$|R

5|$|We wretched and needy men reverently give thee thanks, almighty God, heavenly Father, for {{the food}} which thou hast sanctified and {{bestowed}} for the sustenance of the body, {{so that we may}} use it thankfully; {{at the same time we}} beseech thee that thou wouldst impart to us the food of angels, the true bread of heaven, <b>the</b> <b>eternal</b> word of God, Jesus Christ our Lord, so that our mind may feed on him and that through his flesh and blood we may be nourished, sustained and strengthened.|$|E
5|$|Agitated by this reversal, {{the eldest}} Kaurava, Duryodhana, orders the rakshasa (giant) Alamvusha (or Alambusha), son of Rishyasringa, to kill Iravan. This time Alambusha, {{as well as}} Iravan, uses {{illusion}} in combat. Alambusha attacks Iravan with a bow, but Iravan counters, breaking Alambusha's bow and slicing the giant into several pieces. Alambusha's body, however, reconstitutes itself. Then Iravan assumes {{the form of the}} serpent Shesha (Ananta), and his serpent army surrounds him to protect him. Alambusha counters this by assuming the form of Garuda (the eagle-man), <b>the</b> <b>eternal</b> foe of the serpents, and devours the serpent army. Ultimately, Alambusha kills Iravan by cutting off his head, though Iravan is later avenged when Ghatotkacha, his cousin, finally kills Alambusha.|$|E
