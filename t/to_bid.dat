40|$|In {{a sample}} of 326 U.

The returns <b>to</b> <b>bidding</b> shareholders are lower when their firm diversifies, when it buys a rapidly growing target, and when its managers performed poorly before the acquisition. These results suggest that managerial objectives may drive acquisitions that reduce bidding firms' values. Copyright 1990 by American Finance Association. ...|$|R

The cross-border mergers did not outperform domestic ones. Finally, {{there was no significant difference}} between mergers before the implementation of the EU-Second Banking Directive and those that took place after the implementation. ...|$|R

At a meeting in January 1992, Dyke made it clear ITV would not be positioned as they were already paying too much for football. He and executive director Trevor East commented on BSkyB's debt and felt the company would be forced to increase their borrowing if they were awarded a contract. This did not dissuade Quinton, who urged Murdoch <b>to</b> <b>bid.</b> Quinton even informed Chisholm that there were no bidding rules.|$|E

40|$|Clients engage {{consultant}} quantity surveyors or cost {{engineers to}} perform project cost estimates before calling for tender submissions. This experimental study examines {{the impact of}} releasing the clients’ pre-tender cost estimates prior <b>to</b> <b>bidding</b> on student subjects’ bidding behavioural patterns, and the extents <b>to</b> which their <b>bidding</b> tends <b>to</b> agree with the behavioural patterns proposed by Milgrom and Weber’s theory. The {{results show that the}} provision of clients’ pre-tender cost estimates prior <b>to</b> <b>bidding</b> does affect bidders’ bidding behaviour. Bidders with access to the clients’ pre-tender cost estimates prior <b>to</b> <b>bidding,</b> on average, recorded lower bids than those with no access to the estimate. However, the lower average bids do not result in statistically significant lower winning bids. These findings provide evidence in support of Milgrom and Weber’s theory, demonstrating the practicality of an experimental approach using student subjects for testing theories in building economics research. The practical implication is that construction clients would need to consider their information policy on releasing pre-tender cost estimates to enhance efficiency in their procurement for construction services...|$|R

5|$|For the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, {{the final}} tournament is rotated between confederations, {{allowing}} only countries from the chosen confederation (Africa in 2010, South America in 2014) <b>to</b> <b>bid</b> {{to host the}} tournament. The rotation policy was introduced after the controversy surrounding Germany's victory over South Africa in the vote to host the 2006 tournament. However, the policy of continental rotation will not continue beyond 2014, so any country, except those belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments, can apply as hosts for World Cups starting from 2018. This is partly to avoid a similar scenario to the bidding process for the 2014 tournament, where Brazil was the only official bidder.|$|E
