One of the few additions to the book was Mrs. Voorhees begging the Christy family to take her back after the loss of her son; they agreed.

When Steve Christy reopened the camp, Mrs. Voorhees saw it as a chance that what happened to her son could happen again.

In an effort to explore these concerns, the paper first traces <b>the</b> <b>counselor</b> role and its implications, focusing primarily on attributes of <b>counselors.</b> <b>The</b> role of the teacher is similarly explored for comparison with that of <b>the</b> <b>counselor.</b> Supervision is suggested as a potential conceptual bridge between counseling and teaching since it is as close to either role and shares much in common with both.
