40|$|The {{need for}} ceramic {{materials}} in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) is increasing quickly. A typical form of designed ceramic micro parts involves the structuring of several micro columns and/or thin walls on a substrate. This work considers {{the use of}} a model mould with a straight mould cavity and a step-contracted cross-section in the filling direction. The injection moulding of such of ceramic micro part is experimentally simulated. The effect of the mould cavity contraction ratio, moulding conditions, and the solid loading of the ceramic/binder mixture on the distribution of the <b>transverse</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of the moulding parts at moulded, debinded, and sintered stages, respectively, are examined. Experimental results reveal that <b>transverse</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of the region downstream from the step-contracted cross-section clearly exceeds that of the region upstream in all three stages. Furthermore, <b>transverse</b> <b>shrinkage</b> varies greatly in the plane of the step-contracted cross-section. The magnitude of the variation in <b>transverse</b> <b>shrinkage</b> in the step-contracted cross-section increases with the contraction ratio of the mould cavity. Appropriately increasing either the holding pressure or the filling pressure of the mould cavity reduces the variation in the <b>transverse</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of the step-contracted cross-section. Moreover, using the ceramic/binder mixture with a composition similar to that of critical solid loading can lower the internal stress caused by sintering {{in the vicinity of the}} step-contracted cross-section...|$|E

25|$|Shrinkage and {{swelling}} may occur in wood when the moisture content is changed (Stamm, 1964). Shrinkage occurs as moisture content decreases, while swelling takes place when it increases. Volume {{change is not}} equal in all directions. The greatest dimensional change occurs in a direction tangential to the growth rings. Shrinkage from the pith outwards, or radially, is usually considerably less than tangential shrinkage, while longitudinal (along the grain) shrinkage is so slight as to be usually neglected. The longitudinal shrinkage is 0.1% to 0.3%, in contrast to <b>transverse</b> <b>shrinkages,</b> which is 2% to 10%. Tangential shrinkage is often about twice as great as in the radial direction, although in some species it is as much as five times as great. The shrinkage is about 5% to 10% in the tangential direction and about 2% to 6% in the radial direction (Walker et al., 1993).|$|R
40|$|Drying {{tests were}} {{conducted}} with timber from 13 year-old plantation-grown Eucalyptus nitens and E. globulus, to determine shrinkage and drying degrade of tangential- and radial-sawn boards. The eucalypt species investigated exhibited {{a high level of}} collapse which was difficult to distinguish from normal shrinkage and confounded the results. Nevertheless some useful conclusions about the potential for these techniques to indicate drying stress in plantation grown Eucalyptus were drawn from the qualitative work undertaken: Cup measurements on a half-thickness board, sealed on one face, provided a qualitative indication of stress reversal. This was confirmed with stress prongs. Width of an artificial check did not provide a useful indication of the development of stress. <b>Transverse</b> surface <b>shrinkage</b> measured across specimens and across a fixed core did not provide a useful indication of the development of stress. Cup measurements and stress prongs indicated transverse strains at the surface while surface moisture content was still above fibre-saturation.

The applicability of nondestructive testing methods (visual- and ultrasonic inspection, dye penetration- and eddy current testing, x-ray radiography) is tested. Basing on the tesing results and using the already existing standards and rules, error tolerances for typical welding joint errors in laser beam welded aluminium joints are worked out for the above mentioned sheet thickness. The results are checked on a great variety of welding conditions. Laser beam- and electron beam welding are compared under the aspect of rentability. Both beam welding methods are compared in respect of weld geometry, welding joint errors, angular distortion, <b>transverse</b> solid <b>shrinkage</b> as well as machining systems and costs. The angular distortion depends on the material, the welding gas and the position of the focus.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} first {{observations}} of {{transition from a}} pre-vortex breakdown (Pre-VB) flowreversal to a fully developed central toroidal recirculation zone in a non-reacting, double-concentric swirling jet configuration and its response to longitudinal acoustic excitation. This transition proceeds {{with the formation of}} two intermediate, critical flow regimes. First, a partially penetrated vortex breakdown bubble (VBB) is formed that indicates the first occurrence of an enclosed structure as the centre jet penetration is suppressed by the growing outer roll-up eddy; resulting in an opposed flow stagnation region. Second, a metastable transition structure is formed that marks the collapse of inner mixing vortices. In this study, the time-averaged topological changes in the coherent recirculation structures are discussed based on the non-dimensional modified Rossby number (Ro(m)) which appears to describe the spreading of the zone of swirl influence in different flow regimes. Further, the time-mean global acoustic response of pre-VB and VBB is measured as a function of pulsing frequency using the relative aerodynamic blockage factor (i. e., maximum radial width of the inner recirculation zone). It is observed that all flow modes except VBB are structurally unstable as they exhibit severe <b>transverse</b> radial <b>shrinkage</b> (similar to 20 %) at the burner Helmholtz resonant modes (100 - 110 Hz). In contrast, all flow regimes show positional instability as seen by the large-scale, asymmetric spatial shifting of the vortex core centres. Finally, the mixing transfer function M (f) and magnitude squared coherence lambda(2) (f) analysis is presented to determine the natural couplingmodes of the system dynamic parameters (u', p'), i. e., local acoustic response. It is seen that the pre-VB flow mode exhibits a narrow-band, low pass filter behavior with a linear response window of 100 - 105 Hz. However, in the VBB structure, presence of critical regions such as the opposed flow stagnation region alters the linearity range with the structure showing a response even at higher pulsing frequencies (100 - 300 Hz).

30|$|Drying {{checks are}} formed where the drying {{stress in the}} {{tangential}} direction exceeds the tangential tensile strength of the wood. Drying stress is induced by shrinkage differences in the timber during drying, and, {{it is expected to}} be affected by the moisture gradient, and the <b>transverse</b> <b>shrinkage,</b> and its anisotropy. The moisture gradient varies by the heartwood percentage, and heartwood moisture content, along the stem and among cultivars of sugi [7, 8]. The <b>transverse</b> <b>shrinkage</b> also varies within the stem and among cultivars, depending on the microfibril angle (MFA), density, and tree ring parameters such as the ring width, latewood percentage and latewood density [9].

An on-site inspection was performed to confirm that cracking had not initiated. The data was analyzed and compared with the behavior of a similarly constructed bridge built with nearly identical reinforcing details, but with a more conventional concrete to evaluate the effect of the HPC.

Improved understanding of the mechanisms of flake drying has been provided. Observations of flake drying and drying rate curves revealed that rate of moisture loss consisted of two falling rate periods and no constant rate drying period was observed. Convective heat transfer controls the first period, and bound water diffusion controls the second period. Influence of lower drying temperatures on bending properties of wood flakes was investigated. Drying temperature {{was found to have}} a significant influence on bending stiffness and strength. A worksheet for calculation of the energy required to dry a single strandboard flake was developed but has not been tested in an industrial setting yet. A more complete understanding of anisotropic <b>transverse</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of wood is proposed based on test results and statistical analysis. A simplified mod el of a wood cell's cross-section was drawn for calculating differential <b>transverse</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> The model utilizes cell wall thickness and microfibrillar packing density and orientation. In spite of some phenomena of cell wall structure not yet understood completely, the results might explain anisotropic <b>transverse</b> <b>shrinkage</b> to a major extent. Boundary layer theory was found useful for evaluating external moisture resistance during drying. Simulated moisture gradients were quire comparable to the actual gradients in dried wood. A mathematical procedure for determining diffusion and surface emission coefficients was also developed. Thermal conductivity models of wood derived from its anatomical structure were created and tested against experimental values. Model estimations provide insights into changes in heat transfer parameters during drying. Two new techniques for measuring moisture gradients created in wood during drying were developed. A new technique that utilizes optical properties of cobalt chloride was developed for nondestructive determination of surface moisture content. Fundamental new understanding of drying characteristics in wood and fiber has been provided that can be used by researchers to improve drying of wood and fiber. The three techniques for measuring moisture content and gradients provided in this study are efficient, practical, and economical - easy to apply by industry and researchers.

30|$|These {{observations}} can {{be interpreted}} as follows. Two spliced bars were disconnected near the middle section of a sleeve. As a result, the middle part of the sleeve carried almost all the accumulative tensile loading transferred from the embedded bar and, therefore, resulted in peak stress. In the transverse direction, the strain condition depended on the combination of two factors. The first one was the Poisson effect because sleeves were tensile loaded longitudinally resulting in <b>transverse</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> The second factor was split expansion in the radial direction induced by the filled grout due to bar-grout bond, which caused the sleeves to dilate transversely. Consequently, different sleeve configurations influenced the two factors, resulting in various strain distributions in the transverse direction which can be different from the observation in this study (Einea et al. 1995; Ling et al. 2012).|$|E

The enhanced quality of weld joints obtained with DP-GMAW process is primarily due to the combined effect of pulsed current and thermal pulsation (low frequency pulse). During the thermal pulsation period, there is a fluctuation of wire feed rate, which results in the further increase in welding current and the decrease in arc voltage. Because of this synchronization between welding current and arc voltage during the period of low frequency pulse, the DP-GMAW deposit introduces comparatively more thermal shock compared to the P-GMAW deposit, thereby reducing the heat input and improves the properties of weld joints...|$|E

30|$|For boxed-heart timber, drying {{check is}} {{inevitable}} {{for two reasons}} related to drying stress: moisture gradient and shrinkage anisotropy [3]. One reason {{is that in the}} first stage of the drying of large-dimension timber, only the outer part dries and shrinks, which causes tension stress at the dried outer part and compression stress in the wet inner part. The moisture gradient and the drying stress become larger if the timber contains the sapwood at the outer part and the heartwood at the inner one, because the sapwood dries faster than the heartwood. The other reason is that the tangential shrinkage is much larger than the radial shrinkage, while the tangential strength is lower than the radial strength. Both the moisture gradient and <b>transverse</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of sugi boxed-heart square timber exhibit large variation. The moisture gradient mainly depends on the heartwood percentage, and the difference between the moisture content of heartwood and that of sapwood. The heartwood percentage varies substantially with tree growth. The moisture content of heartwood varies largely among cultivars and along the stem [4, 5]. The shrinkage, which is affected by microfibril angle (MFA), density, and tree ring parameters, also exhibits variation among cultivars and within the stem especially at the core of stem [6, 7].|$|E
