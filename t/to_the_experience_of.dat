5|$|Faulks {{developed}} the novel {{to bring more}} public awareness <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> war remembered by WWI veterans. Most critics found this effort successful, commenting on how the novel, like many other WWI novels, thematically focuses {{on the way in}} which the experience of trauma shapes individual psyches. Similarly, because of the parallel narratives WWI and 1970s Britain, the novel explores metahistorical questions about how to document and recover narratives about the past. Because of its genre, themes and writing style, the novel has been favourably compared to a number of other war novels, like Ian McEwan's Atonement and those in Pat Barker's Regeneration Trilogy.|$|E

5|$|Other {{issues in}} {{philosophy}} of psychology are philosophical {{questions about the}} nature of mind, brain, and cognition, and are perhaps more commonly thought of as part of cognitive science, or philosophy of mind. For example, are humans rational creatures? Is there any sense in which they have free will, and how does that relate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> making choices? Philosophy of psychology also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in cognitive neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, and artificial intelligence, questioning what they can and cannot explain in psychology.|$|E
5|$|Potential presidential {{candidates}} are vetted by an unelected three-member Presidential Elections Committee ("PEC"). The PEC is not constitutionally obliged to give reasons behind its decisions to award or deny {{a certificate of}} eligibility. Its decision {{is not subject to}} legal or political scrutiny, and its verdict is final. There has been criticism of how Andrew Kuan, who applied to be a candidate in the 2005 presidential election, was denied a certificate of eligibility. Before the PEC could reach a decision on the matter, he was reportedly discredited though statements from various people which were published in the media that alleged incompetence and cast doubt on his character. Subsequently, Kuan was denied a certificate, the PEC stating that his seniority and responsibility as the Jurong Town Corporation's Group Chief Financial Officer were not comparable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> a chairman or chief executive officer of a statutory board or a company with a paid-up capital of at least $100 million, as required by the Constitution. There is no legal requirement for the PEC to interview prospective candidates, and it did not do so to allow Kuan to explain his side of the story. As a result, the unopposed incumbent S.R. Nathan was declared the President for a second term.|$|E
5|$|The {{dangers of}} {{radiation}} poisoning had become well-known due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the radium dial painters. When it became certain that nuclear reactors would involve radioactive materials on a gigantic scale, {{there was considerable}} concern about {{the health and safety}} aspects. Robert S. Stone, who had worked with Ernest Lawrence at the University of California, was recruited to head the Metallurgical Project's health and safety program. Simeon Cutler, a radiologist, assumed responsibility for radiation safety in Chicago, before moving on to head the program at the Hanford Site. Groves appointed Stafford L. Warren from the University of Rochester as head of the Manhattan Project's Medical Section. Over time, the study of the biological effects of radiation assumed greater importance. It was discovered that plutonium, like radium, was a bone seeker, making it especially hazardous.|$|E

Trump compares this to the business sector, writing that those who have learned from failures in business simultaneously learn how to become successful entrepreneurs. He differentiates between practical intelligence and academic intelligence.|$|E
25|$|The first European explorers and {{settlers}} {{of what is}} now Canada {{relied on}} the First Nations peoples, for resources and trade to sustain a living.

25|$|This thought {{experiment}} has two purposes. First, it {{is intended}} to show that qualia exist. If one agrees with the thought experiment, we believe that Mary gains something after she leaves the room—that she acquires knowledge of a particular thing that she did not possess before. That knowledge, Jackson argues, is knowledge of the quale that corresponds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> seeing red, and it must thus be conceded that qualia are real properties, since {{there is a difference between}} a person who has access to a particular quale and one who does not.|$|E
25|$|The Council, {{which had}} been {{expanding}} into further buildings as it grew, consolidated once more in the Justus Lipsius building, and in 2002 {{it was agreed that}} the European Council should also be based in Brussels, having previously moved between different cities as the EU's Presidency rotated. From 2004 all Councils were meant to be held in Brussels; however, some extraordinary meetings are still held elsewhere. The reason for the move was in part due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the Belgian police in dealing with protesters and the fixed facilities in Brussels.|$|E
25|$|Hussein's poetry was {{influenced}} by the 11th-century Arab skeptic al-Ma'arri and the early 20th-century Lebanese American poet Elia Abu Madi. Marmorstein wrote: The choice of these two mentors is clearly relevant <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> those Palestinian Muslims who found themselves reduced from majority to minority status. For the scepticism and pessimism of Abu'l-'Ala al-Ma'arri reflect an age of social decay and political anarchy in Islam while Iliya Abu Madi who emigrated in 1911 to the U.S.A., represents the capacity of Arabic literature both to survive in and to be enriched by a non-Arab environment.|$|E

25|$|Vicarious shame: refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> {{shame on}} behalf of another person. Individuals vary in their {{tendency}} to experience vicarious shame, which is related to neuroticism and to the tendency to experience personal shame. Extremely shame-prone people might even experience vicarious shame even to an increased degree, in other words: shame {{on behalf of}} another person who is already feeling shame {{on behalf of a}} third party (or possibly on behalf of the individual proper). The Dutch term for this feeling is 'plaatsvervangende schaamte', the German term is 'die Fremdscham' and in the Spanish language it is referred to as 'vergüenza ajena'.|$|E
25|$|A pilgrim (from the Latin peregrinus) is a {{traveler}} (literally {{one who has}} come from afar) who is on a journey to a holy place. Typically, this is a physical journey (often on foot) to some place of special significance to the adherent of a particular religious belief system. In the spiritual literature of Christianity, the concept of pilgrim and pilgrimage may refer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> life in the world (considered as a period of exile) or to the inner path of the spiritual aspirant from a state of wretchedness {{to a state of}} beatitude.|$|E
25|$|The work of male slaves was a {{much more}} formal affair, {{especially}} in urban settings as compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> slave women. Often, male work groups were divided by ethnicity to work as porters and transporters in gangs, transporting furniture and agricultural products by water or from ships to the marketplace. It was also the role of slave men to bring new slaves from ships to auction. Men also were used as fishermen, canoeists, oarsmen, sailors, and artisans. Up to one-fourth of slaves from 1811–1888 were employed as artisans, and many were men who worked as carpenters, painters, sculptors, and jewelers.|$|E
40|$|According to {{philosophers}} who ground your anticipation <b>of</b> future <b>experiences</b> {{in psychological}} continuity and connectedness, it is rational <b>to</b> anticipate <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> {{someone other than}} yourself, such as a self that {{is the product of}} fission or of replication. In this article, I concur that it is rational <b>to</b> anticipate <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product of fission while denying the rationality <b>of</b> anticipating <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> a replica. In defending my position, I offer the following explanation of why you have good reason <b>to</b> anticipate <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> your post-fission successor but not your replica: in the former case, you become (i. e., substantially change into) somebody else, whereas, in the latter case, you are merely replaced by somebody else...|$|R

25|$|Little {{recalled}} today, the Es Salt {{operation was}} {{with the exception of}} the Gallipoli evacuation, perhaps the most 'close run thing' to occur to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force in the whole Sinai and Palestine campaign. The Ottoman attack on 1 May quickly overwhelmed the 4th Light Horse Brigade and that it managed to withdraw in as good an order as it did, in confused and dangerous circumstances, is testimony <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the troops and the quality of the junior, squadron and regimental leadership. If the brigade had been lost at this time, virtually the entire Australian Imperial Force in the Middle East could have been captured. The Desert Mounted Corps followed these operations with a long, hot, dusty and disease-plagued summer in the Jordan Valley while Allenby's army's British troops were replaced by Indian Army troops before the Battle of Megiddo.|$|E
25|$|In his 2009 book The Keynes Solution, post-Keynesian {{economist}} Paul Davidson makes another historical {{case for}} the effectiveness of Keynesian policy, referring <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the United States during the Great Depression. He notes how economic growth and employment levels increased for four successive years as the New Deal policies were pursued by President Roosevelt. When government spending was cut back in 1937 due to concerns about the budget deficit, all the gains were lost in one year, and growth only resumed after spending increased again from 1938, {{as a response to}} growing acceptance of deficit spending in a recession and later due to World War II. For Davidson, this experience validates the view that Keynesian policy has the power to deliver full employment and prosperity for a government's entire labor force. Davidson also wrote that both price stability and employment in the Keynesian age were superior even to the classical gold standard era that was terminated by World War I.|$|E
25|$|Pain during {{receptive}} {{anal sex}} among gay men (or {{men who have}} sex with men) is formally known as anodyspareunia. In one study, 61% of gay or bisexual men said they experienced painful receptive anal sex and that it was the most frequent sexual difficulty they had experienced. By contrast, 24% of gay or bisexual men stated that they always experienced some degree of pain during anal sex, and about 12% of gay men find it too painful to pursue receptive anal sex; it was concluded that the perception of anal sex as painful is as likely to be psychologically or emotionally based as it is to be physically based. Factors predictive of pain during anal sex include inadequate lubrication, feeling tense or anxious, lack of stimulation, as well as lack of social ease with being gay and being closeted. Research has found that psychological factors can in fact be the primary contributors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> pain during anal intercourse and that adequate communication between sexual partners can prevent it, countering the notion that pain is always inevitable during anal sex.|$|E
