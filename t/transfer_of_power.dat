Mu'ayyad al-Dawla shortly managed to conquer these two provinces.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} this process has been {{described}} as being, in effect, an assertion of paramountcy by the Government of India over the states in a more pervasive form.

5|$|In January 1942, Terboven {{announced}} the German administration would be wound down. Soon afterwards he told Quisling that Hitler had approved the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> scheduled for 30 January. Quisling remained doubtful {{it would happen}} since Germany and Norway {{were in the midst}} of complex peace negotiations that could not be completed until peace had been reached on the Eastern Front, while Terboven insisted that the Reichskommissariat would remain in power until such peace came about. Quisling could nevertheless be reasonably confident that his position within the party and with Berlin was unassailable, even if he was unpopular within Norway, something of which he was well aware.|$|E

5|$|Rwanda {{had been}} {{ruled by a}} Tutsi monarchy {{since at least the}} 18th century, with entrenched pro-Tutsi and anti-Hutu policies. Germany and Belgium {{successively}} controlled Rwanda through the early 20th century, with both European nations ruling through the kings and perpetuating a pro-Tutsi policy. After 1945 a Hutu counter-elite developed, leading to the deterioration of relations between the groups. The Tutsi leadership agitated for speedy independence to cement their power, and the Hutu elite called for the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> from Tutsi to Hutu (a stance increasingly supported by the Roman Catholic Church and the colonial government).|$|E
5|$|The Palmyrene monarchy was new; {{allegiance}} {{was based}} on loyalty to Odaenathus, making the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> to a successor more difficult {{than it would have}} been in an established monarchy. Odaenathus tried to ensure the dynasty's future by crowning his eldest son co-king, but both were assassinated. Zenobia, left to secure the Palmyrene succession and retain the loyalty of its subjects, emphasized the continuity between her late husband and his successor (her son). Vaballathus (with Zenobia orchestrating the process) assumed his father's royal titles immediately, and his earliest known inscription records him as King of Kings.|$|E

5|$|A few British leaders, {{particularly}} Lord Mountbatten, {{the last}} British viceroy of India, were also uncomfortable with breaking links between independent India and the princely states. The development of trade, commerce and communications during the 19th and 20th centuries had bound the princely {{states to the}} British India through a complex network of interests. Agreements relating to railways, customs, irrigation, use of ports, and other similar agreements would get terminated, posing {{a serious threat to}} the economic life of the subcontinent. Mountbatten was also persuaded by the argument of Indian officials such as V. P. Menon that the integration of the princely states into independent India would, to some extent, assuage the wounds of partition. The result was that Mountbatten personally favoured and worked towards the accession of princely states to India following the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> as proposed by the Congress.|$|E
5|$|After the election, Reid orchestrated a quick <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>power.</b> The Social Credit victory had {{provoked}} a bank run, {{and he wanted}} to re-establish stability as quickly as possible. Moreover, the province needed to borrow a large sum of money to meet even its short-term obligations, and the UFA, as a lame duck government, was unable to make promises to would-be creditors. Once in office, confronted with a dire financial situation, Aberhart accused the UFA government of mismanagement. Reid responded in January 1936 that there had been no such mismanagement, that the province's financial problems were due to Social Credit's policies, both real and promised, and that had the UFA won re-election in 1935 it could have continued governing without serious difficulty. He also resisted insinuations that it had been too restrained in helping impoverished farmers: as late as 1969 he was offering the view that shrinking sources of provincial revenue made further assistance impossible.|$|E
5|$|As Prime Minister from 14 January 1991 to 22 August 1991 Pavlov {{initiated}} the 1991 Soviet monetary reform, {{commonly referred to}} as the Pavlov reform, in early 1991. Early on he told the media that the reform was initiated to halt the flow of Soviet roubles transported to the Soviet Union from abroad. Although ridiculed at the time, the statement was later proven to be true. In June the same year, Pavlov called for a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> from the President of the Soviet Union to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers. When that failed, he joined a plot to oust Gorbachev. In August, he participated in the 1991 Soviet coup d'Ã©tat attempt, which tried to prevent the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Pavlov was arrested for his involvement in the coup and went on to work in the banking sector in post-Soviet Russia. He was succeeded as premier by Ivan Silayev.|$|E

5|$|In August 1701, George was {{invested}} with the Order of the Garter and, within six weeks, the nearest Catholic claimant to the thrones, the former king James II, died. William III died the following March and was succeeded by Anne. Sophia became heiress presumptive {{to the new}} Queen of England. Sophia was in her seventy-first year, older than Anne by thirty-five years, but she was very fit and healthy and invested time and energy in securing the succession either for herself or her son. However, it was George who understood the complexities of English politics and constitutional law, which required further acts in 1705 to naturalise Sophia and her heirs as English subjects, and to detail arrangements for the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> through a Regency Council. In the same year, George's surviving uncle died and he inherited further German dominions: the Principality of LÃ¼neburg-Grubenhagen, centred at Celle.|$|E
5|$|In a {{statement}} on Egyptian state television, Suleiman announced the formation of two independent committees for political and constitutional reforms, both starting work immediately.

Suleiman also stressed that demonstrators would not be prosecuted and that a separate independent fact-finding committee would be established to probe the violence of 2February. He said that wider press freedoms were under consideration {{and that he would}} produce a list of what was needed to hold free elections. He also said that plans were underway to organize a peaceful <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>power.</b> Suleiman reiterated his view that Egypt was not ready for democracy, while warning of a possible coup d'Ã©tat unless demonstrators agreed to enter negotiations.|$|E
5|$|In {{partnership}} with the goddess BrÃ¬ghde, the Cailleach {{is seen as a}} seasonal deity or spirit, ruling the winter months between Samhainn (1 November or first day of winter) and Bealltainn (1 May or first day of summer), while BrÃ¬ghde rules the summer months between Bealltainn and Samhainn. Some interpretations have the Cailleach and BrÃ¬ghde as two faces of the same goddess, while others describe the Cailleach as turning to stone on Bealltainn and reverting to humanoid form on Samhainn in time to rule over the winter months. Depending on local climate, the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> between the winter goddess and the summer goddess is celebrated any time between LÃ  FhÃ¨ill BrÃ¬ghde (1 February) at the earliest, Latha na Cailliche (25 March), or Bealltainn (1 May) at the latest, and the local festivals marking the arrival of the first signs of spring may be named after either the Cailleach or BrÃ¬ghde.|$|E

5|$|In the Augustan History, Maeonius was emperor briefly {{before he}} was killed by his soldiers, however, no {{inscriptions}} or evidence exist for his reign. At the time of Odaenathus' assassination, Zenobia might have been with her husband; according to chronicler George Syncellus, he was killed near Heraclea Pontica in Bithynia. The <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> seems to have been smooth, since Syncellus reports that the time from the assassination to the army handing the crown to Zenobia was one day. Zenobia may have been in Palmyra, but this would have reduced the likelihood of a smooth transition; the soldiers might have chosen one of their officers, so the first scenario of her being with her husband is more likely. The historical records are unanimous that Zenobia did not fight for supremacy and {{there is no evidence of}} delay in the transfer of the throne to Odaenathus and Zenobia's son, the ten-year-old Vaballathus. Although she never claimed to rule in her own right and acted as a regent for her son, Zenobia held the reins of power in the kingdom, and Vaballathus was kept in his mother's shadow, never exercising real power.|$|E
5|$|On the Pacific Coast ElBaÃºl Stela1 {{features}} a date in its hieroglyphic text that equates to 36 AD. It depicts a ruler bearing a sceptre or a spear {{with a double}} column of hieroglyphic text before him. At Takalik Abaj are two stelae (Stela2 and Stela5) depicting the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> from one ruler to another; they both show two elaborately dressed figures facing {{each other with a}} column of hieroglyphic text between them. The Long Count date on Stela2 dates it to the 1st centuryBC at the latest, while Stela5 has two dates, the latest of which is 126 AD. The stela was associated with the burial of a human sacrifice and other offerings. Stela13 at Takalik Abaj also dates to the Late Preclassic; a massive offering of more than 600 ceramic vessels was found at its base, together with 33 obsidian prismatic blades and other artefacts. Both the stela and the offering were associated with a nearby Late Preclassic royal tomb. At Cuello in Belize, a plain stela was raised around 100 AD in an open plaza.|$|E
