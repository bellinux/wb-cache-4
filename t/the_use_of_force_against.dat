40|$|Book synopsis: This Oxford Handbook {{provides}} the most comprehensive, authoritative, and detailed study into <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> in international law yet available Over sixty experts offer an unparalleled assessment of <b>the</b> law <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> {{from a range of}} inter-disciplinary perspectives Investigates key recent controversies in this field, including forcible humanitarian action and pro-democratic intervention, the expansive interpretation of self-defence, the ability of non-state actors to mount armed attacks of significant scale and destructive power, and the doctrine of exceptionalism <b>The</b> prohibition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> in international law {{is one of the major}} achievements of international law in the past century. The attempt to outlaw war as a means of national policy and to establish a system of collective security after both World Wars resulted in the creation of the United Nations Charter, which remains a principal point of reference for the law on <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> to this day. There have, however, been considerable challenges to the law on <b>the</b> prohibition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> over <b>the</b> past two decades. This Oxford Handbook is a comprehensive and authoritative study of the modern law on <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force.</b> Over seventy experts in the field offer a detailed analysis, and to an extent a restatement, of the law in this area. The Handbook reviews the status of the law on <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force,</b> and assesses what changes, if any, have occurred in consequence to recent developments. It offers cutting-edge and up-to-date scholarship on all major aspects of <b>the</b> prohibition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force.</b> <b>The</b> work is set in context by an extensive introductory section, reviewing the history of the subject, recent challenges, and addressing major conceptual approaches. Its second part addresses collective security, in particular the law and practice of the United Nations organs, and of regional organizations and arrangements. It then considers the substance of <b>the</b> prohibition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force,</b> and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right to self-defence and associated doctrines. The next section is devoted to armed action undertaken on behalf of peoples and populations. This includes self-determination conflicts, resistance to armed occupation, and forcible humanitarian and pro-democratic action. The possibility of the revival of classical, expansive justifications for <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> is then addressed. This is matched by a final section considering new security challenges and the emerging law in relation to them. Finally, the key arguments developed in the book are tied together in a substantive conclusion. The Handbook will be essential reading for scholars and students of international law and <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force,</b> and legal advisers to both government and NGOs...|$|R

Bose attempted to maintain unity, but Gandhi advised Bose to form his own cabinet. The rift also divided Bose and Nehru. Bose appeared at the 1939 Congress meeting on a stretcher. He was elected president again over Gandhi's preferred candidate Pattabhi Sitaramayya. U. Muthuramalingam Thevar strongly supported Bose in the intra-Congress dispute. Thevar mobilised all south India votes for Bose. However, due to the manoeuvrings of the Gandhi-led clique in the Congress Working Committee, Bose found himself forced to resign from the Congress presidency.|$|E

Admiral Nicholson was sent with ships to attack the port at Chittagong, fortify it, make an alliance with the King of Arakan who was against the Mughals, establish a mint and collect revenue, thus making Chittagong a fort city for the British in the eastern part. Then {{he was ordered to}} proceed to Dhaka. It was assumed that the Governor would abandon the city and then a peace treaty would be offered which would guarantee free trade and other economic benefits for the British and he would give up the territory of Dhaka and Chittagong.

25|$|To combat this {{humanitarian}} {{crisis in the}} Congo, the United Nations Security Council approved MONUC, the predecessor of the current peacekeeping mission, through resolutions Resolution 1279 (1999) and Resolution 1291 (2000). This mission, with {{an annual budget of}} over one billion USD annually, has become the most expensive and extensive peacekeeping mission to date. Unfortunately, while the mission was successful in some regards, it received widespread criticism for its failure to take direct action against the rebel groups deemed responsible for the war and violence. For example, beginning 14 May 2002, the Rwandan-backed Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) rebel movement engaged in “widespread killings, summary executions, rapes, and pillage” in the northern town of Kisangani. In 2003, a similar event occurred in Icari in eastern Congo. In both cases, MONUC officers refused to authorize <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> <b>against</b> the rebels, maintaining that force was only permitted in self-defence under Chapter VI of the MONUC mandate.|$|E
