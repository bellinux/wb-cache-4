The <b>transpiration</b> <b>ratio</b> is {{the ratio of the}} mass of water transpired to the mass of dry matter produced; the <b>transpiration</b> <b>ratio</b> of crops tends to fall between 200 and 1000 (i.e., crop plants transpire 200 to 1000 kg of water for every kg of dry matter produced).|$|E

The use of loose mulches will reduce evaporative losses for a period after a field is irrigated, {{but in the end}} the total evaporative loss will approach that of an uncovered soil.

Water use efficiency is measured by <b>transpiration</b> <b>ratio,</b> which is the ratio of the total water transpired by a plant to the dry weight of the harvested plant. Transpiration ratios for crops range from 300 to 700.

Leaf P:C {{was positively correlated with}} <b>transpiration</b> <b>ratio</b> across 19 species for plants grown under similar conditions (R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 35, P[*]<[*] 0. 01, n[*]=[*] 19). For five species in the dataset, multiple treatments were imposed to cause intra-specific variation in <b>transpiration</b> <b>ratio.</b> Within four of these five species, leaf P:C correlated positively with <b>transpiration</b> <b>ratio.</b> The slope and strength of the correlation varied among species. In one experiment, whole-plant P:C was measured in addition to leaf P:C. Patterns of correlation between whole-plant P:C and <b>transpiration</b> <b>ratio</b> were similar to those between leaf P:C and <b>transpiration</b> <b>ratio.</b> Together, these observations suggest that transpiration can influence the rate of P uptake from soil in tropical tree and liana seedlings. We suggest that this occurs through transport of inorganic phosphate and organic P compounds to root surfaces by transpiration-induced mass flow of the soil solution. The positive correlation between leaf P:C and <b>transpiration</b> <b>ratio</b> suggests that leaf P:C could decline in tropical forests as atmospheric CO 2 concentration rises, due to decreasing transpiration ratios...|$|E
40|$|During {{the period}} of October 1974 to August 1976, a study was {{conducted}} to measure the effects of surface soil removal on plant production, plant transpiration rates, nitrate nitrogen mineralization rates, and selected hydrologic parameters (infiltration rates, potential sediment production, and chemical quality of runoff water). The treatments were incremental 7. 6 centimeter soil layers to a depth of 30. 5 centimeters. Plant production and <b>transpiration</b> <b>ratios</b> (or water use efficiencies) were measured in greenhouse studies using Agrogyron desertorum grown in the incremental 7. 6 centimeter soil layers from five study sites throughout the state of Utah, (Blanding, Brush Creek, Milford, Huntington, and Dove Creek). Significant decreases in plant production and increases in <b>transpiration</b> <b>ratios</b> were measured for all sites at incremental depths beyond 7. 6 centimeters. These changes in plant production and <b>transpiration</b> <b>ratios</b> were found to be linearly related to the nitrate nitrogen content of the soils as determined at the time the soils were collected for use in the greenhouse. Nitrogen mineralization rates for a 6 week period were measured under field conditions at Milford and Blanding for each of the 7. 6 centimeter incremental soil layers. Nitrate nitrogen mineralization was linearly correlated to the organic carbon content of the soil. Decreased mineralization rates as measured in the field at both study sites were reflected in significant increases in plant water requirements and also decreases in production as measured in greenhouse studies. Hydrologic parameters were measured at each 7. 6 centimeter incremental soil depth using a Rocky Mountain infiltrometer. With one exception, significant differences in infiltration capacities among treatment depths did not occur during either 1975 or 1976 at either the Blanding or Milford site. At the Blanding site a significant decrease in the infiltration capacity occurred beyond the 22. 9 centimeter depth due to a hardpan development. A significant change in infiltration capacities was noted between the 1975 and 1976 field seasons as pooled over both treatment depths and study sites. There {{were no significant differences in}} potential sediment production between sites or among treatment depths within a site. In terms of runoff water quality, a significant change in phosphorus was observed only at the Blanding site between the 1975 and 1976 field seasons.

40|$|There is {{continuing}} {{debate about the}} role of water productivity and the potential to increase it in response to significantly increased water demand to meet the future needs for food?estimated to be roughly double that of today by 2050. The debate centers round the relative potential benefits of enhancing rainfed agriculture, improving irrigation and expanding areas of both. All expansion and intensification options will require significantly more water to be used, often in places where the ecosystem impacts of agriculture are already severe. Improvement in water productivity can result from improving the provision and management of the other factor inputs of crop production. There is considerable debate on the ability of other inputs?typically nitrogen?to substitute for water. This paper describes a set of simulations undertaken with well calibrated maize (Zea mays L.) crop model in Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer (DSSAT). The simulations investigate the response to nitrogen under rainfed conditions in Florida, and show that neither the <b>transpiration</b> <b>ratio</b> nor the harvest index are constant in practice, and that fertilizer use can enhance water productivity, even in quite high yield conditions and that the <b>transpiration</b> <b>ratio</b> can be increased by N fertilizer application at low levels of crop water use...|$|E

We evaluated spatio-temporal compensated and uncompensated RWU patterns of mature pecan tree in a silty clay loam orchard using the HYDRUS (2 D/ 3 D) model. HYDRUS (2 D/ 3 D) simulations, which agreed well with measured water contents and temperatures at different soil depths and horizontal distances from the tree trunk, suggested that while both compensated and uncompensated RWU varied with soil depth {{they did not do}} so laterally because of similar spatial vertical distributions of root length density (RLD) for the under-canopy and the tree canopy dripline locations. Considering compensated RWU resulted in an increase in actual transpiration by 8 %, and a decrease in evaporation and drainage by 5 % and 50 %, respectively, during a growing season.

Results from single-species studies are equivocal in {{their support of}} the classic ‘hygric hypothesis ’ {{for the evolution of}} DGC, whereas comparative analyses generally support a link between DGC and water balance. In this study, we investigated DGC prevalence and characteristics and RWL in three grasshopper species (Acrididae, subfamily Pamphaginae) across an aridity gradient in Israel. In order to determine whether DGC contributes to a reduction in RWL, we compared the DGC characteristics and RWL associated with CO 2 release (<b>transpiration</b> <b>ratio,</b> i. e. the molar ratio of RWL to CO 2 emission rates) among these species. Transpiration ratios of DGC and continuous breathers were also compared intraspecifically. Our data show that DGC characteristics, DGC prevalence and the transpiration ratios correlate well with habitat aridity. The xeric-adapted Tmethis pulchripennis exhibited a significantly shorter burst period and lower <b>transpiration</b> <b>ratio</b> compared with the other two mesic species, Ocneropsis bethlemita and Ocneropsis lividipes. However, DGC resulted in significant water savings compared with continuous exchange in T. pulchripennis only. These unique DGC characteristics for T. pulchripennis were correlated with its significantly higher mass-specific tracheal volume. Our data suggest that the origin of DGC may not be adaptive, but rather that evolved modulation of cycle characteristics confers a fitness advantage under stressful conditions.

40|$|Cultivars of {{groundnut}} (Arachis hypogaea L.) {{were subjected}} to a period of reduced soil water supply during early reproductive development. During the period of water deficit, total biomass production of two Virginia type cultivars (Virginia Bunch and Q 18801) was {{greater than that of}} a Spanish type cultivar (McCubbin), even though all cultivars used similar amounts of radiation and water. Hence, the radiation use efficiency and transpiration efficiency of Q 18801 were significantly greater than those of McCubbin. The radiation use efficiency of the stressed crops was only about 45 % of those that were fully irrigated. Throughout the period of water deficit, noon leaf water potential was lowest in McCubbin in both treatments. In the well-watered treatment, this was associated with a higher leaf temperature and lower leaf conductance, than in the Virginia cultivars. Under increasing soil water deficit, the leaves of McCubbin tended to wilt, while the Virginia cultivars displayed active leaf folding. Thus, the ratio of the fraction of radiation intercepted by the canopy to leaf area index (LAI) was always lower in the Virginia type cultivars. For a given LAI, this phenomenon may have allowed these cultivars to decrease the effective atmospheric demand within the canopy, while maintaining radiation interception at saturation for photosynthesis. The consequence of this, given that the supply of water from the roots did not differ, was that Q 18801 was able to maintain a higher LAI and a greater crop <b>transpiration</b> efficiency (<b>ratio</b> of biomass production to transpiration) than McCubbin. The existence of differences among cultivars in transpiration efficiency under drought may prove useful in improving adaptation of groundnut to these environments...|$|R

The resistance for water vapor diffusion from a leaf (RWV) became less than 20 sec cm− 1 when the soil water potential at 10 cm became greater than − 3 bars, as would occur after a 7 -mm rainfall. As a consequence of its shallow root system (mean depth of 8 cm), A. deserti responded rapidly to the infrequent rains, and the succulent nature of its leaves allowed stomatal opening to continue for up to 8 days after the soil became drier than the plant. When the leaf temperature at night was increased from 5 to 20 C, RWV increased 5 -fold, emphasizing the importance of cool nighttime temperatures for gas exchange by this plant.

The transpiration ratios of the C 3 and CAM species, which ranged between 496 g H 2 O g– 1 dry mass in the C 3 –CAM species Clusia pratensis Seeman to 54 g H 2 O g– 1 dry mass in the constitutive CAM species Aloe vera, correlated strongly with δ 13 C values and nocturnal CO 2 gain suggesting that δ 13 C value {{can be used to}} estimate both water-use efficiency and the proportion of CO 2 gained by CAM species during the light and the dark integrated over the lifetime of the tissues...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of boundary layer cumulus clouds {{and their impact}} on land surface–atmosphere exchange is presented. Seasonal trends indicate that in response to increasing insolation and sensible heat flux, both the mixed-layer height (zi) and the lifting condensation level (LCL) peak (; 1250 and 1700 m) just before the growing season commences. With the commencement of <b>transpiration,</b> the Bowen <b>ratio</b> falls abruptly in response to the infusion of additional moisture into the boundary layer, and zi and LCL decrease. By late spring, boundary layer cumulus cloud frequency increases sharply, as the mixed layer approaches a new equilibrium, with zi and LCL remaining relatively constant (; 1100 and 1500 m) through the summer. Boundary layer cloud time fraction peaks during the growing season, reaching values greater than 40 % over most of the eastern United States by June. At an Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) station in central Massachusetts, a growing season peak is apparent during 1995 – 98 but reveals large variations in monthly frequency due to periods of drought or excessive wetness. Light–cloud cover regression relationships developed from ASOS ceilometer reports for Orange, Massachusetts, and Harvard Forest insolation data show a good linear fit (r 2 5 0. 83) for overall cloud cover versus insolation, and a reasonable quadratic fit (r 2 5 0. 48) for cloud cover versus the standard deviation of insolation, which is an indicator of sky type. Diffuse fraction (the ratio of diffuse to global insolation) show...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to analyze the effects of a) {{short-term}} treatments with different concentrations of O 3 (daily 6 -hour fumigation with 0, 65, 175 and 300 ppb for 3 - 4 days); and b) a medium term treatment with O 3 (150 ppb {{three times a week}} for thirty days on the whole) and CO 2 (700 ppm) on gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and peroxidase activity in holm oak (Quercus ilex L.) leaves. The results show that net photosynthesis, <b>transpiration,</b> F(V) /F(M) <b>ratio</b> and POD activity were not influenced until an O 3 concentration of 300 ppb was reached. At this threshold, significant alterations in these physiological and biochemical parameters were found. The treatment with +CO 2 +O 3 showed an increase of net photosynthesis suggesting thus an antagonistic effect of CO 2 with regard to O 3 -induced injuries, while CO 2 alone increased photosynthesis and decreased transpiration but induced no effects on F(V) /F(M) ratio or peroxidase activity. From our data, holm oak shows a resistance to episodes of photochemical O 3 stress, that in the Mediterranean region can reach peaks of > 100 ppb. This response is likely to be due to the morpho-anatomic structure of holm oak leaves and their sclerophyllous adaptations. This might leads holm oak to adopt a stress tolerance strategy with regard to leaf response to O 3, the effects of which cannot be ameliorated by an increase of atmospheric CO 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{magnitude}} of the percentage inhibition of photosynthesis by atmospheric levels of O 2 in the C 3 species Solanum tuberosum L., Medicago sativa L., Phaseolus vulgaris L., Glycine max L., and Triticum aestivum L. increases {{in a similar manner}} with an increase in the apparent solubility ratio of O 2 /CO 2 in the leaf over a range of solubility ratios from 25 to 45. The solubility ratio is based on calculated levels of O 2 and CO 2 in the intercellular spaces of leaves as derived from whole leaf measurements of photosynthesis and <b>transpiration.</b> The solubility <b>ratio</b> of O 2 /CO 2 can be increased by increased leaf temperature under constant atmospheric levels of O 2 and CO 2 (since O 2 is relatively more soluble than CO 2 with increasing temperature); by increasing the relative levels of O 2 /CO 2 in the atmosphere at a given leaf temperature, or by increased stomatal resistance. If the solubility ratio of O 2 /CO 2 is kept constant, as leaf temperature is increased, by varying the levels of O 2 or CO 2 in the atmosphere, then the percentage inhibition of photosynthesis by O 2 is similar. The decreased solubility of CO 2 relative to O 2 (decreased CO 2 /O 2 ratio) may be partly responsible for the increased percentage inhibition of photosynthesis by O 2 under atmospheric conditions with increasing temperature...|$|R
40|$|Traditional Chinese {{medicine}} {{relies heavily}} on herbs, {{yet there is no}} information on how these herb plants would respond to climate change. In order to gain insight into such response, we studied the effect of elevated [CO 2] on Isatis indigotica Fort, {{one of the most popular}} Chinese herb plants. The changes in leaf photosynthesis, chlorophyll fluorescence, leaf ultrastructure and biomass yield in response to elevated [CO 2] (550 ± 19 µmol mol(- 1)) were determined at the Free-Air Carbon dioxide Enrichment (FACE) experimental facility in North China. Photosynthetic ability of I. indigotica was improved under elevated [CO 2]. Elevated [CO 2] increased net photosynthetic rate (P N), water use efficiency (WUE) and maximum rate of electron transport (J max) of upper most fully-expended leaves, but not stomatal conductance (gs), <b>transpiration</b> <b>ratio</b> (Tr) and maximum velocity of carboxylation (V c,max). Elevated [CO 2] significantly increased leaf intrinsic efficiency of PSII (Fv'/Fm') and quantum yield of PSII(ΦPS II), but decreased leaf non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), and did not affect leaf proportion of open PSII reaction centers (qP) and maximum quantum efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm). The structural chloroplast membrane, grana layer and stroma thylakoid membranes were intact under elevated [CO 2], though more starch grains were accumulated within the chloroplasts than that of under ambient [CO 2]. While the yield of I. indigotica was higher due to the improved photosynthesis under elevated [CO 2], the content of adenosine, one of the functional ingredients in indigowoad root was not affected...|$|E
40|$|The {{parasitic}} weed Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth. (witchweed) {{is a major}} biotic constraint to {{pearl millet}} [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br. ] production in Sahelian Africa. To address this constraint, more information is needed on host-parasite relations under varying conditions of soil water and nutrient availability typically found in the Sahel. The dynamics of moisture, N, and Striga infestation on pearl millet transpiration and growth were investigated. The effects of Striga infestation, water deficit stress, and N availability on root length and dry weight, shoot dry weight, and <b>transpiration</b> <b>ratio</b> (TR; g dry matter kg− 1 transpiration) were evaluated. Millet was grown in 36 -L pots for 45 d in a glasshouse, using two levels of water and N availability and three levels of Striga infestation. With no N, shoot dry weight of uninfested millet plants was low. Shoot weight was further reduced by 42 % at the high level (71 000 seeds pot−) of Striga infestation. With the addition of 60 kg ha− of N, shoot weight of uninfested millet plants increased five- to sixfold. A reduction of 36 % in shoot weight was observed in plants with N and highest infestation of Striga. Root dry weight was also low without N, but unaffected by Striga infestation. With the addition of N, root dry weight of millet plants increased under adequate and water-stressed conditions. Root length in the upper 0. 10 m followed a similar trend...|$|E
40|$|The {{nutritional}} {{economy of}} the fruit of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp cv Vita 3) was assessed quantitatively from intake and utilization of carbon, nitrogen, and water. Fruits failed to make net gains of CO 2 from the atmosphere during daytime, although pod photosynthesis did {{play a role in}} the fruit's carbon economy by refixing a proportion of the fruit's respired CO 2. Of every 100 units by weight of carbon entering the fruit, 70. 4 were finally incorporated into seeds, 10. 3 remained as nonmobilizable material in pod walls, and the remaining 19. 3 were lost in fruit respiration. Phloem supplied 97 % of the fruit's carbon and 72 % of its nitrogen. The xylem contribution of nitrogen occurred mainly in early growth. Ninety-six% of the fruit's nitrogen was incorporated into seeds, approximately 10 % of this mobilized from the senescing pod. The mean <b>transpiration</b> <b>ratio</b> of the fruit was very low— 8 milliliters water transpired per gram dry matter accumulated. Models of carbon, nitrogen, and water flow were constructed for the two consecutive 11 day periods of fruit development, and indicated a considerably greater entry of water through xylem and phloem than could be accounted for in changes in fruit tissue water and transpiration loss. This discrepancy was greater in the second half of fruit growth and was interpreted as evidence that a significant fraction of the water entering the fruit through phloem cycled back to the parent plant via the xylem...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} novel method to {{quantify}} the ecophysiological effects of changes in CO 2 concentration during the reconstruction of climate changes from fossil pollen assemblages. The method {{does not depend on}} any particular vegetation model. Instead, it makes use of general equations from ecophysiology and hydrology that link moisture index (MI) to <b>transpiration</b> and the <b>ratio</b> of leaf-internal to ambient CO 2 (χ). Statistically reconstructed MI values are corrected post facto for effects of CO 2 concentration. The correction is based on the principle that e, the rate of water loss per unit carbon gain, should be inversely related to effective moisture availability as sensed by plants. The method involves solving a non-linear equation that relates e to MI, temperature and CO 2 concentration via the Fu-Zhang relation between evapotranspiration and MI, Monteith’s empirical relationship between vapour pressure deficit and evapotranspiration, and recently developed theory that predicts the response of χ to vapour pressure deficit and temperature. The solution to this equation provides a correction term for MI. The numerical value of the correction depends on the reconstructed MI. It is slightly sensitive to temperature, but primarily sensitive to CO 2 concentration. Under low LGM CO 2 concentration the correction is always positive, implying that LGM climate was wetter than it would seem from vegetation composition. A statistical reconstruction of last glacial maximum (LGM, 21 ± 1 kyr BP) palaeoclimates, based on a new compilation of modern and LGM pollen assemblage data from Australia, is used to illustrate the method in practice. Applying the correction brings pollen-reconstructed LGM moisture availability in southeastern Australia better into line with palaeohydrological estimates of LGM climate...|$|R
40|$|Increased <b>transpiration</b> {{efficiency}} (the <b>ratio</b> {{of biomass}} to water transpired, TE) {{could lead to}} increased drought tolerance under some water deficit scenarios. Intrinsic (i. e., leaf-level) TE is usually considered as {{the primary source of}} variation in whole-plant TE, but empirical data usually contradict this assumption. Sunflower has a significant variability in TE, but a better knowledge of the effect of leaf and plant-level traits could be helpful to obtain more efficient genotypes for water use. The objective of this study was, therefore, to assess if genotypic variation in whole-plant TE is better related to leaf- or plant-level traits. Three experiments were conducted, aimed at verifying the existence of variability in whole-plant TE and whole-plant and leaf-level traits, and to assess their correlation. Sunflower public inbred lines and a segregating population of recombinant inbred lines were grown under controlled conditions and subjected to well-watered and water-deficit treatments. Significant genotypic variation was found for TE and related traits. These differences in whole-plant transpiration efficiency, both between genotypes and between plants within each genotype, showed no association to leaf-level traits, but were significantly and negatively correlated to biomass allocation to leaves and to the ratio of leaf area to total biomass. These associations are likely of a physiological origin, and not only a consequence of genetic linkage in the studied population. These results suggest that genotypic variation for biomass allocation could be potentially exploited as a source for increased transpiration efficiency in sunflower breeding programmes. It is also suggested that phenotyping for TE in this species should not be restricted to leaf-level measurements, but also include measurements of plant-level traits, especially those related to biomass allocation between photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic organs...|$|R
40|$|The {{degree to}} which {{branches}} are autonomous in their acclimation responses to alteration in light environment is still poorly understood. We investigated the effects of shading of the sapling crown of Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook on the whole-tree and mid-crown branch growth and current-year foliage structure and physiology. Four treatments providing 0, 50, 75 and 90 % shading compared with full daylight (denoted as Treatment(0), Treatment(50 %), Treatment(75 %) and Treatment(90 %), and Shaded(0), Shaded(50 %), Shaded(75 %) and Shaded(90 %) for the shaded branches and Sunlit(0), Sunlit(50 %), Sunlit(75 %) and Sunlit(90 %) for the opposite sunlit branches under natural light conditions, respectively), were applied over two consecutive growing seasons. Shading treatments decreased the growth of basal stem diameter, leaf dry mass per unit leaf area, stomatal conductance, <b>transpiration</b> rate, the <b>ratio</b> of water-soluble to structural leaf nitrogen content, photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency and instantaneous and long-term (estimated from carbon isotope composition) water-use efficiency in shaded branches. Differences between shaded and sunlit branches increased with increasing severity and duration of shading. A non-autonomous, partly compensatory behavior of non-shaded branches was observed for most traits, thus reflecting the dependence between the traits of sunlit branches and the severity of shading of the opposite crown half. The results collectively indicated that tree growth and branch and leaf acclimation responses of C. lanceolata are not only affected by the local light environment, but also by relative within-crown light conditions. We argue that such a non-autonomous branch response to changes in light conditions can improve whole-tree resource optimization. These results contribute to better understanding of tree growth and utilization of water and nitrogen under heterogeneous light conditions within tree canopies...|$|R
