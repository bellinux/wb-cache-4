First we analyzed <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>toward</b> multicultural practices to understand how those are developed both in the U. S., and in Brazil. We examined multicultural education as a means to generate equal academic access for students from diverse gender, race, culture, and social class. Following, we expanded our understanding of multicultural practices by examining the Affirmative Action as a social justice movement. We asked whether policies can be interculturally adopted, and adapted, to create social justice in educational systems across different countries in the Americas.
