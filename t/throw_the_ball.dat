5|$|After {{suffering}} {{an injury}} and being {{knocked out of}} Michigan's game with Nebraska (a 23–9 loss to the Cornhuskers) on October 27, Robinson returned to the lineup for the last home game of the 2012 season, a 42-17 victory over Iowa. Playing in his final game at Michigan Stadium, Robinson split his playing time between the tailback, quarterback, and wide receiver positions. He accounted for 122 yards, including 98 rushing yards on 13 carries and 24 receiving yards on two receptions. With the injury to the ulnar nerve in his right elbow, Robinson did not <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> during the game {{and was forced to}} carry the ball in his right hand.|$|E
5|$|Hilliard {{averaged}} 19.7 {{points per}} game as a senior. He was named Express-Times {{player of the year}} after leading the Hurricanes to {{the second round of the}} PIAA playoffs. Hilliard scored 1,413 points in his high school career, finishing second in Liberty history to Warren West. He committed to Villanova in November 2010. When Hilliard informed his mother he was receiving a full scholarship to Villanova, she did not understand and was trying to figure how much she would have to pay for her son's education. In addition to his basketball prowess, Hilliard was the quarterback on his high school football team and could <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> 65 yards.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{began its}} drive with an {{incomplete}} pass, which {{was followed by}} a short run. On third down, Vick prepared to <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> but he was hit by Clemson defender Keith Adams and fumbled the ball. Fellow Clemson defender Terry Jolly recovered the loose football and returned it to the Tech 14-yard line before he was tackled. Following the turnover, Dantzler was stopped on a short run then threw two incomplete passes. Rather than again attempt to convert a fourth down, Bowden sent in kicker Aaron Hunt to attempt a 28-yard field goal. The kick soared through the uprights, and Clemson narrowed Virginia Tech's lead to 1410 with 5:45 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ball</b> can be <b>thrown</b> {{in several}} ways. <b>Throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> while running causes <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{to move in}} <b>the</b> {{direction}} faced. <b>Throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> while standing still allows a 360 degree aim, with better tracking. <b>Throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> while jumping increases the force at which <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> hits.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the target}} player comes {{into contact with}} <b>the</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>ball</b> in any way (unless he or she catches <b>the</b> <b>ball),</b> {{he or she is}} penalized with one letter (i.e., S P U or D), and then is charged with <b>throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> into <b>the</b> air for the next round. If the target player does not come into contact with <b>the</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>ball</b> or <b>the</b> target player catches <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> <b>the</b> player who <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is penalized with one letter, and then is charged with <b>throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> into <b>the</b> air for the next round.|$|R
50|$|<b>Throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> into <b>the</b> stands or {{otherwise}} preventing a ball from being made live promptly after a made goal to allow one's team {{to set up}} on defense (if a blatantly unsportsmanlike act, a technical foul against the player; otherwise, a warning to that team and team technicals thereafter). This includes <b>throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to an official when such act is not required—such would likely incur a warning. In addition, <b>throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> at an opponent's head may also be considered a technical foul.|$|R
5|$|Indiana {{began the}} second quarter in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a second down at its 25-yard line. After a rushing play was stopped for a loss and Paci was forced to <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> away to avoid a sack, Indiana punted {{for the first time}} in {{the second quarter}}. Tech resumed offense at its 41-yard line. DeShazo completed a pass to the Indiana 47-yard line, then a 25-yard toss to Cornelius Wright, who carried it to the Indiana 22. Swarm carried the ball for a first down inside the Indiana 10-yard line, and two plays later, he carried it across the goal line for Virginia Tech's second touchdown of the game. Following the extra point, Tech took a 147 lead with 11:14 remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana {{completed}} 32 of 46 {{passes for}} 356 yards {{before leaving the}} game with an injury in the fourth quarter. The injury, {{similar to the one}} that ended Lee Roy Selmon's career, would require season-ending surgery and threaten Montana's football future. Steve DeBerg's 31-yard touchdown pass to Gerald Carter in the third quarter brought the Buccaneers to within a touchdown, but they would not score again. The 49ers' seven interceptions of DeBerg were a team record, and one short of the NFL record. DeBerg placed blame for the loss on himself, but teammates defended him, pointing out that he was under constant pressure from the 49ers' pass rush. Opposing safety Ronnie Lott said that DeBerg was predictable as to where he would <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> when pressured. James Wilder rushed for 81 yards and caught five passes. Selmon's number 63 was retired in a halftime ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's offense {{began work}} at its 20-yard line needing to score quickly {{in order to}} have a chance at making up the 10-point deficit, which would require two {{separate}} scores to make good. Mike Cox completed a seven-yard pass, then Maurice Williams broke free for a 15-yard rush that gave Tech a first down and drove the Hokies to the 42-yard line. Cox completed a long pass into the Air Force red zone, but the completion was negated by an offensive pass interference penalty against Tech that cost the Hokies the long completion, a loss of down, and an additional 15yards. While scrambling for extra time in which to <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> Cox was sacked by Air Force defender Chris Funk and fumbled the ball. Air Force recovered the loose football, and the Falcons' offense returned to the field with just over four minutes left to play.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the outset}} of the 2011 season, head coach Rex Ryan named Sanchez a team captain. The Jets opened the season with a 2–3 record leading to discontent within the clubhouse. The team had begun to stray from their {{philosophy}} of consistently running the ball and began to pass more often; however, the offense struggled with this adjustment. Wide receivers Plaxico Burress, Santonio Holmes, and Derrick Mason approached coach Ryan to question offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer's system as Holmes and Mason averaged only three catches per game and Burress only 2.5 catches through four games. Additionally, Sanchez drew criticism for his difficulties to effectively <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to his receivers. The struggles culminated with Holmes getting into a heated argument with another teammate in the huddle during their final regular season game against the Miami Dolphins. Holmes was benched in the fourth quarter while Sanchez threw three interceptions in the Jets' loss that eliminated the team from playoff contention {{for the first time in}} Sanchez's career. Statistically, Sanchez had similar numbers in a comparison to Eli Manning when he concluded his third year of football however, there were concerns that Sanchez was simply an ineffective quarterback and therefore expendable. During the offseason, Sanchez was criticized by anonymous teammates for his poor work ethic and his inability to improve; these claims were publicly refuted by other teammates. Despite questions surrounding his job security, after New York acquired Tim Tebow, the Jets agreed to a 3-year contract extension with Sanchez on March 9, 2012. The contract included $20 million in guarantees.|$|E
5|$|Penn State {{received}} the opening kickoff, and after achieving a first down, Christian Hackenberg threw a 68-yard pass to fellow freshman Adam Breneman for a touchdown, the first offensive touchdown Wisconsin had {{allowed in the}} previous eight quarters. Wisconsin failed to respond, going three-and-out, and punting on their subsequent drive. Penn State, though they began with poor field position, converted a few third downs, gained 52 yards on a bubble screen to Allen Robinson, and ultimately {{was faced with a}} fourth down and inches in the red zone, but committed a false start penalty bringing on the field goal unit. The field goal was blocked, continuing Penn State's special teams woes, however their defense remained stout, forcing another punt, however on the Lions' ensuing drive, Hackenberg threw his first incomplete pass of the day, forcing a punt. In the waning minutes of the first quarter, the Badgers embarked on a drive in which they scored several first downs from both the running game and passing game. At the end of the quarter, they trailed 7–0, but were threatening, and a few minutes later, tied the game via a 4-yard pass from Joel Stave to tight end Brian Wozniak. Later in the quarter, Wisconsin converted a third down and 16 situation, and ultimately scored a touchdown on a pass from Stave to Jeff Duckworth. On their next drive, Penn State was set up in the red zone after a pass interference call in the end zone that broadcaster Ed Cunningham criticized, and a few plays later scored a touchdown via a 3-yard pass to Geno Lewis. Lewis was uncovered on the goal line play, and though Wisconsin coach Gary Andersen ran down the sideline signalling for a timeout, it was not granted, and the play stood. At the half, the score was tied at 14. After Wisconsin's opening drive stalled, the Nittany Lions embarked on a demoralizing drive that fostered widespread defensive confusion from Wisconsin and ultimately ended when Jesse James caught a 7-yard touchdown pass from Hackenberg to put Penn State on top 21–14. On the ensuing Wisconsin drive, Penn State freshman linebacker sacked Stave and forced a fumble that defensive end C. J. Olaniyan returned deep into Wisconsin territory. Penn State earned points, with Ficken redeeming himself on a 28-yard field goal to put Penn State up by 10 points. On the next two drives, each team went three-and-out. At {{the end of the third}} quarter, Wisconsin was near midfield during a drive in which they looked to pull within a field goal; at the end of the quarter, Penn State led 24–14. On one of the first plays of the fourth quarter, Trevor Williams intercepted Stave's pass, ending a scoring threat, and furthering the Nittany Lions' momentum. Penn State started their drive at their own 28-yard line, and had a third down and short, but a false start backed them up to a third and long; Hackenberg was unfazed, however, as he threw a 59-yard touchdown pass to Geno Lewis, putting Penn State up by three possessions, 31–14. Down three scores, Wisconsin desperately needed a touchdown, and tried to convert a fourth down and 23, but Penn State recorded a sack, and subsequently got the ball with 9:49 to play. They failed to execute, and about a minute later, punted the ball away. Wisconsin drove down the field and pulled within 10, 31–21, on a Wozniak reception, his second touchdown catch of the day. Penn State got the ball off an onside kick with good field position, and faced a third down and three, but Donovan Smith committed his fourth false start of the day, and Penn State had to <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> and the pass was incomplete. Penn State's subsequent punt was blocked. On the ensuing drive, Jack Russell kicked a career long 48-yard field goal to pull Wisconsin within seven points. Penn State started their drive after Wisconsin kicked it deep inside their own 20-yard line. Penn State got some decent yardage on first down, but committed another false start, backing them up. Zwinak came through for the Lions, however, rushing on third-and-nine for 61 yards, his longest run of the season. From there, Penn State's drive stalled, and with 35 seconds left, Ficken attempted a 31-yard field goal, but missed, and Wisconsin consequently needed to drive the length of the field to score a touchdown, and they did get into Penn State territory, but ultimately, with nine seconds left, Stave threw the ball into the end zone, and Penn State safety Ryan Keiser came away with the interception for a touchback. Christian Hackenberg took a knee to end the game, and the Nittany Lions concluded their upset, winning 31–24.|$|E
