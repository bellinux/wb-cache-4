5|$|At {{one point}} it was {{considered}} that the two former Line E stations and tunnels {{should be used for}} Line F since the line's southern terminus would be there and <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> route would be roughly similar to the old Line E. However, it was eventually decided that the line should use new tunnels in that section due to its sharp curves.|$|E
5|$|During {{the mission}} status briefing, Jennifer Wiseman, Chief of Exoplanet and Stellar Astrophysics for Goddard Space Flight Center, {{noted that the}} repair of STIS was a major victory for both the mission and the science community, as <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{telescope}} performed unique functions, helping scientists understand the materials planets are composed of, and looking at things like the motion of stars around black holes.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, Chaoyong and Yangwei {{continued}} to operate together. They operated out of Taku, {{but since the}} water froze over during winter, they would spend <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year in the Korean port of Chemulpo (now Incheon).

5|$|According to Home Office statistics, an {{estimated}} 400businesses within {{half a mile}} (0.8km) of the blast were affected, 40% of which did not recover. The heaviest damage was sustained by the three buildings nearest the bomb: Michael House, comprising a Marks & Spencer store and a six-storey office block; Longridge House, offices for Royal and Sun Alliance, an insurance company; and the Arndale Centre, a shopping mall. Michael House was deemed beyond economic repair and demolished. Marks & Spencer {{took the opportunity to}} acquire and demolish the adjacent Longridge House, using the enlarged site for the world's biggest branch of the store. The company's fortunes changed during construction, and Selfridges subsequently co-occupied the building; Marks & Spencer leased part of the Lewis's store in the interim. The frontage of the Arndale was badly damaged and was removed in a remodelling of <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city centre.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus is {{regarded}} as senior synonym of the genera Creosaurus, Epanterias, and Labrosaurus. Most of the species that are regarded as synonyms of A. fragilis, or that were misassigned to the genus, are obscure and were based on scrappy remains. One exception is Labrosaurus ferox, named in 1884 by Marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw, with a prominent gap in the tooth row {{at the tip of}} the jaw, and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down. Later researchers suggested that the bone was pathologic, showing an injury to the living animal, and <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unusual form of the rear of the bone was due to plaster reconstruction. It is now regarded as an example of A. fragilis.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was stopped}} at Kőszeg {{and failed to}} conquer Vienna, Suleiman {{additionally}} secured his possession in Hungary by conquering several forts, since Ferdinand and Charles evaded an open field battle. Immediately after the Ottoman withdrawal, Ferdinand reoccupied devastated territory in Austria and Hungary. Nevertheless, Suleiman concluded a peace treaty with Ferdinand in 1533, in Constantinople. The treaty confirmed the right of John Zápolya as a king of all Hungary, but recognised Ferdinand's possession of <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country that enjoyed the status quo.|$|E

5|$|An angular {{unconformity}} truncates progressively older (lower) {{parts of the}} underlying Pahrump Group starting {{in the southern part}} of the area and moving north. At its northernmost extent, the unconformity in fact removed all of the Pahrump, and the Noonday rests directly on the Proterozoic Complex. An ancient period of erosion removed <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pahrump due to its being higher (and thus more exposed) than the rest of the formation.|$|E
5|$|Another {{part of the}} 5th Division had {{gathered}} unseen below Courtnay's Post, which was held by the 14th Battalion, and at 04:00 they rushed the trench, throwing hand grenades. The post was only defended by an Australian section, two of whom were killed and another two wounded; as the Turks occupied <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> post the surviving Australians retreated. The Turks were {{now in a position}} to observe and bring fire down on Monash Valley. However, from another section of the post Private Albert Jacka led a small group of men in a counter-attack on the Turks. Jacka shot five of the Turks, bayoneted another two, and chased the rest out of the post. For this feat he was awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|As {{the route}} {{traverses}} hilly terrain, {{it requires a}} substantial number of viaducts and tunnels, as well as two major bridges to span the Drava and Mura rivers. The motorway consists of two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction separated by a central reservation. There are no emergency lanes in the tunnels. All intersections of the A4 motorway are grade separated. As of October 2010, there are 12exits and 3rest areas operating along the route. As the motorway is tolled using a ticket system, each exit includes a toll plaza. Exits south of the Sveta Helena mainline toll plaza have no toll plazas, as <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> A4 route is not tolled. The same applies to the northernmost section between the Goričan exit and the Hungarian border.|$|E

5|$|As {{the second}} English {{football}} club to float on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club raised significant capital, {{with which it}} further developed its commercial strategy. The club's focus on commercial and sporting success brought significant profits in an industry often characterised by chronic losses. The strength of the Manchester United brand was bolstered by intense off-the-field media attention to individual players, most notably David Beckham (who quickly developed his own global brand). This attention often generates greater interest in on-the-field activities, and hence generates sponsorship opportunities – the value of which is driven by television exposure. During his time with the club, Beckham's popularity across Asia was integral to the club's commercial success in <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world.|$|E
5|$|By 7:00a.m. Central Daylight Time, CAPE values began {{exceeding}} 4,000 j/kg, a {{level that}} climatologically favors the development of severe thunderstorms. Despite conflicting model data on the specified area where thunderstorms would develop, the newly available information that denoted a more favorable severe thunderstorm setup in <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state prompted the SPC to upgrade the forecasted threat of severe weather to a moderate risk for south-central Kansas, much of the western two-thirds of Oklahoma, and the northwestern and north-central portions Texas at 11:15a.m. CDT that morning, which now indicated an elevated threat of strong tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Central eclipse {{is often}} used as a generic term for a total, annular, or hybrid eclipse. This is, however, not {{completely}} correct: {{the definition of a}} central eclipse is an eclipse during which the central line of the umbra touches the Earth's surface. It is possible, though extremely rare, <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> umbra intersects with the Earth (thus creating an annular or total eclipse), but not its central line. This is then called a non-central total or annular eclipse. The last (umbral yet) non-central solar eclipse was on April 29, 2014. This was an annular eclipse. The next non-central total solar eclipse will be on April 9, 2043.|$|E
