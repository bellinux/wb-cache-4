5|$|Despite {{some initial}} success, the {{expedition}} of Boleslaw to Kiev in 1018 failed to establish Svyatopolk Vladimirovich (Boleslaw's son-in-law), Prince of Turov, on the Kievan throne. The Polish ruler did at least gain the Red Ruthenia (Czerwien Grody) very briefly, <b>though</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> recovered for the Ruthenians by Grand Prince Yaroslav and Mstislav Vladimirovich, Prince of Chernigov, in 1031.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the Dip the Dips Scenic Railway {{roller coaster}} opened but was soon overshadowed in 1912 {{by the larger}} Leap the Dips ride. In 1917, Dip the Dips was razed and {{replaced}} by the Leap Frog Scenic Railway. With three roller coasters and a growing variety of other rides, Cedar Point was beginning to grow as an amusement park, <b>though</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not Boeckling's priority. He marketed the peninsula primarily as a bathing resort complete with shows, exhibits, motion pictures, {{and other forms of}} entertainment, but did not emphasize the park's rides.|$|E

5|$|Just as Julie and Keys {{celebrate}} their victory, the dog, without warning, turns {{its attention to}} Carruthers and brutally attacks him. The dog had not previously shown any aggression towards him--no explanation for this is given, but implications go that the dog's programming has somehow been reversed, <b>though</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> never Keys's intention, or that Carruthers has a similarity to the dog's original owner whom the dog hates now. To save his employer's life, Keys is forced to shoot and kill the dog, and the film ends {{with the image of}} the dog's body lying {{in the center of the}} training enclosure while Julie weeps over his dead body.|$|E
5|$|Laurence succeeded Augustine to the see of Canterbury {{in about}} 604, and ruled {{until his death}} on 2February 619. To secure the succession, Augustine had consecrated Laurence before he died, even <b>though</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{prohibited}} by canon law. Augustine was afraid though that if someone did not step into the office immediately, it would damage the missionary efforts in Britain. However, Laurence never received a pallium from Rome, so {{he may have been}} considered uncanonical by the papacy. Bede makes a point of comparing Augustine's action in consecrating Laurence to Saint Peter's action of consecrating Clement as Bishop of Rome during Peter's lifetime, which the theologian J. Robert Wright believes may be Bede's way of criticising the practices of the church in his day.|$|E
25|$|The International Maritime Bureau (IMB) reports {{worldwide}} pirate attacks {{fell for}} the third year in a row in 2006. Attacks on ships at sea in 2006 fell to 239vessels, down from 276 in 2005. That same trend echoed in the Strait of Malacca where attacks dropped from 79 in 2005 to 50 in 2006. Nonetheless, in 2004, the region accounted for 40% of piracy worldwide. The IMB reported in October 2007 that Indonesia continued to be the world's most pirate-struck region with 37attacks since January 2007, <b>though</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> an improvement from the same nine-month period in 2006.|$|E

25|$|The madaris rose as {{colleges of}} {{learning}} in the Islamic world in the 11th century, though there were institutions of learning earlier. They catered {{not only to the}} religious establishment, <b>though</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the dominant influence over them, but also the secular one.

Even to this day many Registered madaris are Working effectively and coping up with Modern Education System such as Jamia-tul-Madina which is a chain of Islamic schools in Pakistan and in European and other countries established by Dawat-e-Islami. The Jamia-tul-Madina are also known as Faizan-e-Madina. Dawat-e-Islami has grown its network of Madaris from Pakistan to Europe.|$|E
25|$|However, in English law, the {{decision}} in Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Commission (1968) is seen as having done away with the distinction, even <b>though</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not {{the intention of the}} House of Lords. In R. v. Lord President of the Privy Council, ex parte Page (1992), it was held that since Parliament only confers power on a public authority on the basis that it is to be exercised on the correct legal basis, any misdirection in law will render {{the decision}} ultra vires. Thus, in general, all errors of law are now considered as jurisdictional and ultra vires in a broad sense of the term, and the High Court can intervene to correct them.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the time}} of Newton and Hooke, {{scholarly}} discussion has also touched {{on the question of}} whether Hooke's 1679 mention of 'compounding the motions' provided Newton with something new and valuable, even <b>though</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not a claim actually voiced by Hooke at the time. As described above, Newton's manuscripts of the 1660s do show him actually combining tangential motion with the effects of radially directed force or endeavour, for example in his derivation of the inverse square relation for the circular case. They also show Newton clearly expressing the concept of linear inertia—for which he was indebted to Descartes' work, published in 1644 (as Hooke probably was). These matters do not appear to have been learned by Newton from Hooke.|$|E

500|$|A large cask of un-slaked lime {{was found}} open on Chesapeakes forecastle, and another bag of lime was {{discovered}} in the fore-top. British sailors alleged the intention was to throw handfuls {{into the eyes of}} Shannons men in an unfair and dishonourable manner as they attempted to board, <b>though</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> never done by Chesapeakes crew. Historian Albert Gleaves has called the allegation [...] "absurd," [...] noting, [...] "Lime is always carried in ship's stores as a disinfectant, {{and the fact that it}} was left on the deck after the ship was cleared for action was probably due to the neglect of a junior, or petty, officer." ...|$|E

Falle later said, [...] "We were prey for every paedophile, pervert, pimp and drug dealer that was out there." [...] The man who had recruited Falle in Chinatown became her pimp. Adults began advertising Falle's sexual services in newspapers. Falle engaged in both indoor and outdoor prostitution, working as an escort, in strip clubs, and at massage parlours. At the legal establishments where she engaged in prostitution, escort drivers engaged in organized crime, selling guns, alcohol, cocaine, and stolen goods and pimping children in massage parlours.|$|E
500|$|Bristol Cathedral {{was founded}} as St Augustine's Abbey in 1140 by Robert Fitzharding, a wealthy local {{landowner}} and royal official {{who later became}} Lord Berkeley. As the name suggests, the monastic precinct housed Augustinian canons. The original abbey church, of which only fragments remain, was constructed between 1140 and 1148 in the Romanesque style, known in England as Norman. The Venerable Bede made reference to [...] St Augustine of Canterbury visiting the site in 603ACE, and John Leland had recorded {{that it was a}} long-established religious shrine. William Worcester recorded in his Survey of Bristol that the original Augustinian abbey church was further to the east of the current site, <b>though</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt as the church of St Augustine the Less. [...] That site was bombed during World War Two and the site built on by the Royal Hotel, but archaeological finds were deposited with Bristol Museum and Art Gallery. The dedication ceremony was held on 11 April 1148, and was conducted by the Bishops of Worcester, Exeter, Llandaff, and St Asaph.|$|E
