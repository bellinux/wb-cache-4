5|$|Delayed gratification, or {{deferred}} gratification, is {{the ability}} <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> <b>temptation</b> for an immediate reward and wait for a later reward. Generally, delayed gratification is associated with resisting a smaller but more immediate reward {{in order to receive}} a larger or more enduring reward later. A growing body of literature has linked the ability to delay gratification to a host of other positive outcomes, including academic success, physical health, psychological health, and social competence.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Hobbits’ fears, Faramir {{was wise}} {{enough to realize that}} such a weapon was not to be used and if desired, should be resisted. With this knowledge, he also {{realized}} what his brother had to face, and wished that he had gone on the quest himself — knowing that Boromir {{would not have been able}} <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> <b>temptation</b> to seize the Ring for himself. Giving the Hobbits provisions, he sent them on their way to continue their quest, but warned Frodo that their guide, Gollum, was a treacherous creature, and that an unknown terror lived in Cirith Ungol, where Gollum was leading them.|$|E
5|$|The 1969–70 season {{opened with}} {{victory in the}} 1969 FA Charity Shield, as Bremner captained Leeds to a 2–1 victory over Manchester City. With new arrival Allan Clarke played upfront {{alongside}} Mick Jones and Peter Lorimer Revie had to instruct Bremner and Giles <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> <b>temptation</b> to get forward and attack. It took the team some time to gel, as only two wins came from the opening eight league games, and Leeds eventually finished a distant second to champions Everton. They chased Everton all season only {{to give up on}} the title after a home defeat by Southampton late in the campaign. In the European Cup Leeds recorded a club record 10–0 win over Norwegian side Lyn, with Bremner netting two of the goals. However they exited the competition at the semi-final stage after two defeats to Celtic; Bremner levelled the aggregate score by putting United 1–0 ahead in front of a competition record 136,505 spectators at Hampden Park, but Celtic came back to win the game and the tie with two second half goals. Further disappointment came in the 1970 FA Cup Final, where Leeds were beaten 2–1 in extra-time of the replay at Old Trafford. Bremner was named as FWA Footballer of the Year for the season.|$|E

Walter Hart, the club's chairman, spoke of the good character of the players, most of whom still worked at their own trades when not required for football, suggesting that [...] "a man who had nothing to do but loaf about from week's end to week's end was not ready for play, and such a mode of life was not conducive to good football". He praised the players' esprit de corps and pluck which had taken them {{to the top of the}} division, and encouraged them <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> <b>temptation</b> to sign for other clubs, insisting that [...] "whatever money [...] made after providing things of necessity would come to the players and... the club could do as well for its players, if they only clung together, as any club in the country".

40|$|This article {{examines}} the role of generosity in public administration from a peculiar literary perspective, that of Wallace Shawn’s play, The Designated Mourner. In the recent past, deontologists in the discipline, such as Emette Redford, articulated rich theories of demo-cratic responsiveness, but today these theories no longer command a scholarly consensus. This collapse, or “death, ” of deontology {{has led to a}} scramble for a new philosophical foun-dation to animate the study and practice of administration, with various candidates self-pro-claiming themselves to be deontology’s designated mourner. This {{article examines}} three candidates: neo-Lockean natural law, neo-Habermassean communicative competence, and neo-Nietzschean receptive generosity.

According to this perspective, an urban history of airports can be traced from the first aerodromes dedicated to large urban publics to the development of spectacular airports driven by the massive recent routinization of air transport so intricately bound up with globalization. Based on research on specific cases of the design and building of New York and Paris airports, this article aims <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> <b>temptations</b> <b>to</b> dehistoricize <b>the</b> airport topic, and to introduce a narrative mode of thinking about these specific and concrete spaces...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In Chaman Nahal's The Gandhi Quartet. illicit {{love affairs}} play {{a pivotal role}} in the fictionalisation of many {{historical}} and political events of Indian history from 1915 to 1952. They are employed mainly to serve as a literary technique to reduce the characters to mere mortals by portraying them as being unable <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> <b>temptations</b> of their carnal desires, thereby preventing them from being idealised and making them appear as ordinary human beings, not as demi-gods. But for their illicit love affairs, all the prominent characters, especially Gandhi's followers, namely Sunil, Kusum, Raja Vishal Chand, Vikram and Rahena would have appeared so ideal. Another purpose that illicit affairs serve in the epic novel is the reflection of socially unacceptable forms of man-woman relationship like elopement, free love, incest and live-in prevailing both in Indian society as well a...|$|R
40|$|The Olympic Games are an {{invention}} of the ancient Greeks. They were held in Olympia in a quadrennial rhythm, without interruption for ca. 1200 years. Compared with the modern Olympics, the ancient programme was small: running events (over several distances), the pentathlon, and the so-called heavy events: wrestling, boxing and pankration. Various equestrian events (with and without chariots) completed the programme. This programme is discussed with the athletes, their social background and ideology. Although in ancient Olympia a wreath of olive-leaves a forerunner of our modern gold medal {{was the first and}} only prize, there was no amateurism in Greek athletics. Olympic athletes happily participated in highly rewarding money games {{both before and after the}} Olympics.

2500|$|Although Plato did {{not have}} an {{explicit}} theory of natural law (he rarely used the phrase 'natural law' except in Gorgias 484 and Timaeus 83e), his concept of nature, according to John Wild, contains some of the elements found in many natural law theories. According to Plato, we live in an orderly universe. The basis of this orderly universe or nature are the forms, most fundamentally the Form of the Good, which Plato describes as [...] "the brightest region of Being". The Form of the Good is the cause of all things, and when it is seen it leads a person to act wisely. In the Symposium, the Good is closely identified with the Beautiful.

40|$|Individual {{differences}} in working memory capacity (WMC) {{have been shown to}} predict how well people perform tasks that require directed attention, but the individual differences responsible for task-set switching and noticing behaviors are less well understood. In this study, 86 undergraduate students from California State University, Northridge completed a measure of WMC, a measure of cognitive flexibility, and attempted to identify disappearing objects in change-blindness slides. WMC was not related to our measure of cognitive flexibility or change detection, but cognitive flexibility was directly correlated with the ability to notice change. The findings suggest that the ability to notice sudden changes in an environment, an ability that is of paramount importance for the safe operation of complex machinery and systems, may be supported by individual differences that are independent of WMC. Working Memory Capacity (WMC) {{has been described as a}} person’s ability to support the active maintenance of goal-relevant information in the face of interference (Conway, Kane, Engle, 2003).
