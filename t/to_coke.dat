5|$|After Parliament was {{dissolved}} in June 1802, another election saw Coke again returned, although in a contested election that cost the candidates £35,000. With {{the death of}} William Pitt in 1806, the two Whig groups agreed to an alliance, which {{took the form of}} the Ministry of All the Talents; Fox was confirmed as Foreign Secretary, and Windham as Secretary for War and the Colonies. The government apparently offered Coke a peerage, which he refused, and primarily focused on the abolition of slavery, which was accomplished only after the death of Fox on 13 September 1806. Fox's death made Parliament lose some of its appeal <b>to</b> <b>Coke,</b> as they had been close friends. His attendance {{in the next two years}} was very limited, and the next occasion of note was his support of the Corn Laws, which were highly unpopular in Norfolk and led to him being physically attacked by a mob in 1815.|$|E

That same month the government took steps <b>to</b> capture <b>Coke.</b> In a run-up <b>to</b> <b>Coke's</b> arrest, more than 70 people-all {{but one of}} them civilians-died in a 24 May 2010 raid of the Kingston neighborhood he was associated with.

25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, many changes had come to the iron industry. In addition to the shift from local to foreign ores, coke had largely replaced anthracite as the principal furnace fuel. No. 7 and 8 stacks at Alburtis were reputedly the last furnaces in the country to use anthracite, converting <b>to</b> <b>coke</b> in 1914. The shift away from local ores and fuels eliminated much of the original competitive advantage of the Lehigh Valley furnaces.|$|E
25|$|Coca-Cola uses a {{coca leaf}} extract {{prepared}} by a Stepan Company plant in Maywood as in ingredient. The facility, {{which had been}} known as the Maywood Chemical Works (and is also a known Superfund site), was purchased by Stepan in 1959. The plant is the only commercial entity in the country authorized by the Drug Enforcement Administration to import coca leaves, which come primarily from Peru. The non-narcotic extract is sold <b>to</b> <b>Coke,</b> while the active ingredient is sold to a pharmaceutical firm for medicinal purposes.|$|E
25|$|Management {{rejected}} {{an idea to}} {{make and}} sell the new flavor as a separate Coke variety. The company's bottlers were already complaining about absorbing other recent additions into the product line since Diet Coke in 1982; Cherry Coke was launched nationally nearly concurrently with New Coke during 1985. Many of them had sued over the company's syrup pricing policies. A new variety of Coke in competition with the main variety could also have cannibalized Coke’s sales and increase the proportion of Pepsi drinkers relative <b>to</b> <b>Coke</b> drinkers.|$|E

Coke's ownership in Full Throttle and Burn will be transferred to Monster. In return, Monster will transfer its ownership in Hansen's Natural Sodas and Peace Iced Tea <b>to</b> <b>Coke.</b> Muhtar Kent, Coke's Chief Executive Officer, stated {{that the company has}} the option to increase its stake to 25 percent but cannot exceed that percentage in the next four years.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, {{perhaps in}} {{response}} to the burgeoning popularity of low-carbohydrate diets such as the Atkins diet, Coca-Cola announced its intention to develop and sell a low-carbohydrate alternative <b>to</b> <b>Coke</b> Classic, dubbed C2 Cola. C2 contains a mix of high fructose corn syrup, aspartame, sucralose, and Acesulfame potassium. C2 is designed to more closely emulate the taste of Coca-Cola Classic. Even with {{less than half of the}} food energy and carbohydrates of standard soft drinks, C2 is not a replacement for zero-calorie soft drinks such as Diet Coke. C2 went on sale in the U.S. on June 11, 2004, and in Canada in August 2004. C2's future is uncertain due to disappointing sales.|$|E
500|$|Eventually, {{the king}} began {{negotiations}} with the American colonies and accepted the resignation of Lord North – an action which would, eventually, lead <b>to</b> <b>Coke</b> leaving Parliament. A new government was formed in April 1782, with Lord Rockingham as Prime Minister and Fox and Lord Shelburne as Secretaries of State. Rockingham and Shelburne disagreed constantly, particularly over the situation in North America, and with Rockingham's death on 1 July Shelburne was made Prime Minister. At this {{the rest of the}} government resigned, and after a period of political chaos the short-lived Fox-North Coalition was formed in April 1783. Coke was disgusted by this arrangement, describing it as a [...] "revolting compact". An East India Bill, which created 7 commissioners to oversee India, brought chaos to the coalition. Controversially, the commissioners would be appointed by the government, not by the crown, which challenged what the King saw as his constitutional right. Defeated in the House of Lords, the bill was used by George III to overturn Fox's government and install a government led by William Pitt the Younger. Parliament was eventually dissolved on 25 March 1784, and thanks to Coke's long-standing support of Fox and his actions, the ensuing general election led <b>to</b> <b>Coke</b> losing his seat.|$|E

500|$|The {{first to}} speak was the Speaker of the House of Commons (later Master of the Rolls), Sir Edward Philips, who {{described}} the intent behind the plot in lurid detail. [...] He {{was followed by}} the Attorney-General Sir Edward Coke, who began with a long speech—the content of which was heavily influenced by Salisbury—that included a denial that the King had ever made any promises to the Catholics. [...] Monteagle's part in the discovery of the plot was welcomed, and denunciations of the 1603 mission to Spain featured strongly. [...] Fawkes's protestations that Gerard knew nothing of the plot were omitted from Coke's speech. [...] The foreign powers, when mentioned, were accorded due respect, but the priests were accursed, their behaviour analysed and criticised wherever possible. [...] There was little doubt, according <b>to</b> <b>Coke,</b> that the plot had been invented by the Jesuits. [...] Garnet's meeting with Catesby, at which the former was said to have absolved the latter of any blame in the plot, was proof enough that the Jesuits were central to the conspiracy; [...] according <b>to</b> <b>Coke</b> the Gunpowder Plot would always be known as the Jesuit Treason. Coke spoke with feeling of the probable fate of the Queen {{and the rest of the}} King's family, and of the innocents who would have been caught up in the explosion.|$|E

500|$|In Marbury v. Madison (1803), {{the case}} that forms {{the basis for the}} {{exercise}} of judicial review in America, Chief Justice John Marshall stated that [...] "the particular phraseology of the Constitution of the United States confirms and strengthens the principle, supposed to be essential to all written constitutions, that a law repugnant to the constitution is void, and that courts, as well as other departments, are bound by that instrument". Marshall specifically used the words [...] "void" [...] and [...] "repugnant", which has been characterised as a deliberate reference <b>to</b> <b>Coke,</b> but Marshall's principle involved repugnancy to the written Constitution. instead of repugnancy to reason. In Hurtado v. California (1884), the US Supreme Court discussed Bonham's Case specifically by saying that it had not affected the omnipotence of parliament over the common law.|$|E

500|$|In the United States, Coke's {{decision}} {{met with}} a better reaction. During the legal and public campaigns against the writs of assistance and Stamp Act 1765, Bonham's Case was given as a justification for nullifying the legislation. Marbury v. Madison, the American case which forms {{the basis for the}} exercise of judicial review in the United States under Article III of the Constitution, uses the words [...] "void" [...] and [...] "repugnant", seen as a direct reference <b>to</b> <b>Coke.</b> Some academics, such as Edward Samuel Corwin, have argued that Coke's work in Bonham's Case forms the basis of judicial review and the declaration of legislation as unconstitutional in the United States. Gary L. McDowell calls this [...] "one of the most enduring myths of American constitutional law and theory, to say nothing of history", pointing out that at no point during the Constitutional Convention was Bonham's Case referenced.|$|E
500|$|Although Thomas Coke {{oversaw the}} project, he {{delegated}} the on-site architectural duties {{to the local}} Norfolk architect Matthew Brettingham, who was employed as the on-site clerk of works. Brettingham was already the estate architect, and was in receipt of £50 a year (about [...] pounds per year in [...] terms) in return for [...] "taking care of his Lordship's buildings". He was also influential {{in the design of}} the mansion, although he attributed the design of the Marble Hall <b>to</b> <b>Coke</b> himself. William Kent was mainly responsible for the interiors of the Southwest pavilion, or family wing block, particularly the Long Library. Kent produced a variety of alternative exteriors, suggesting a far richer decoration than Coke wanted. Brettingham described the building of Holkham as [...] "the great work of [...] ", and when he published his [...] "The Plans and Elevations of the late Earl of Leicester's House at Holkham", he immodestly described himself as sole architect, making no mention of Kent's involvement. However, in a later edition of the book, Brettingham's son admitted that [...] "the general idea was first struck out by the Earls of Leicester and Burlington, assisted by Mr. William Kent".|$|E
500|$|Birmingham {{had long}} been a centre of the ironworking industry. In the early 18th century the town entered a period of {{expansion}} as iron working became easier and cheaper with the transition (beginning in 1709) from charcoal <b>to</b> <b>coke</b> {{as a means of}} smelting iron. [...] Scarcity of wood in increasingly deforested England and discoveries of large quantities of coal in Birmingham's county of Warwickshire and the adjacent county of Staffordshire speeded the transition. Much of the iron was forged in small foundries near Birmingham, especially in the Black Country, including nearby towns such as Smethwick and West Bromwich. [...] The resultant thin iron sheets were transported to factories in and around Birmingham. [...] With the town far from the sea and great rivers and with canals not yet built, metalworkers concentrated on producing small, relatively valuable pieces, especially buttons and buckles. [...] Frenchman Alexander [...] wrote that while he had seen excellent cane heads, snuff boxes and other metal objects in Milan, [...] "the same can be had cheaper and better in Birmingham". [...] These small objects {{came to be known as}} [...] "toys", and their manufacturers as [...] "toymakers".|$|E

500|$|On 13 August 1582 Coke married Bridget, the {{daughter}} of John Paston, a Counsellor from Norwich. Paston came {{from a long line}} of lawyers and judges – his great grandfather, William Paston, was a Justice of the Court of Common Pleas. Having grown up nearby Coke knew the family, and asked for Bridget's hand immediately after she turned eighteen. At the time he was a thirty-one-year-old barrister with a strong practice, and her father had no qualms about accepting his offer. Six months after they married John Paston died, leaving his daughter and son-in-law his entire estate and several of his clients. Bridget maintained a diary, which reveals that she mainly ran the household. Despite this she was an independent woman, travelling without her husband and acting as a helpmate <b>to</b> <b>Coke.</b> Bridget was noted by Woolrych as an [...] "incomparable" [...] woman who had [...] "inestimable value clearly manifested by the eulogies which are lavished on her character". The couple settled at the manor of Huntingfield, described by Catherine Drinker Bowen as [...] "enchanting, with a legend for every turret... A splendid gallery ran the length of the house, the Great Hall was built around six massive oaks which supported the roof as they grew".|$|E
500|$|Speaking for the government, Edward Coke {{accused him}} of {{involvement}} in every treason since 1586, the year he returned to England. [...] According <b>to</b> <b>Coke,</b> the provincial superior {{was involved in the}} Main and Bye Plots of 1603. [...] He had sent Edmund Baynham to Rome to gain papal approval for the 1605 plot, and while at Coughton in November, had prayed [...] "for the success of the great action". Coke called Garnet [...] "a doctor of five Ds, namely, of dissimulation, of deposing of princes, of disposing of kingdoms, of daunting and deterring of subjects, and of destruction". His supposed inappropriate relationship with Anne Vaux was mentioned, but his adherence to the doctrine of equivocation proved extremely damaging. Francis Tresham's deathbed letter, which claimed that Garnet had played no part in the so-called Spanish Treason, was read aloud. [...] Tresham claimed not to have seen Garnet [...] "for fifteen or sixteen years before", despite government evidence that the two had met more recently. Garnet had not seen the letter and did not know that it referred to events before 1602, not 1605. He was unable to explain it, except by saying [...] "it may be, my Lord, that he meant to equivocate." ...|$|E
500|$|Garnet {{may have}} been {{questioned}} on as many as 23occasions. [...] His response {{to the threat of}} the rack was [...] "Minare ista pueris [...] ", and he denied having encouraged Catholics to pray for the success of the [...] "Catholic Cause". [...] His interrogators resorted to the forgery of correspondence between Garnet and other Catholics, but to no avail. [...] His jailers then allowed him to talk with another priest in a neighbouring cell, with eavesdroppers listening to every word. [...] Eventually Garnet let slip a crucial piece of information, that there was only one man who could testify that he had any knowledge of the plot. Under torture Garnet admitted that he had heard of the plot from fellow Jesuit Oswald Tesimond, who had learnt of it in confession from Catesby. [...] Garnet was charged with high treason and tried in the Guildhall on 28March, in a trial lasting from 8am until 7pm. According <b>to</b> <b>Coke,</b> Garnet instigated the plot: [...] " [...] hath many gifts and endowments of nature, by art learned, a good linguist and, by profession, a Jesuit and a Superior as indeed he is Superior to all his predecessors in devilish treason, a Doctor of Dissimulation, Deposing of Princes, Disposing of Kingdoms, Daunting and deterring of subjects, and Destruction." [...] Garnet refuted all the charges against him, and explained the Catholic position on such matters, but he was nevertheless found guilty and sentenced to death.|$|E
