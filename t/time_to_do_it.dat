25|$|In January 1684, Edmond Halley, Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke had a {{conversation}} in which Hooke claimed to not only have derived the inverse-square law, but also all the laws of planetary motion. Wren was unconvinced, Hooke did not produce the claimed derivation although the others gave him <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> and Halley, who could derive the inverse-square law for the restricted circular case (by substituting Kepler's relation into Huygens' formula for the centrifugal force) but failed to derive the relation generally, resolved to ask Newton.|$|E
25|$|The Third Test {{began at}} Chennai on 18 March with high {{expectations}} of a hard-fought series decider. Australia won the toss {{for the third time}} and elected to bat. Hayden batted through the first day for an eventual total of 203, but the rest of Australia's team contributed little to the total of 391. Again, Harbhajan Singh was the destroyer, taking 7–133. India pushed to 501 on the back of Tendulkar's 126. Australia ended day 4 at 241/7, a precarious lead of 131 runs. Early on day 5, Harbhajan again ran through the Australian tail, taking 8–84 and his series tally to an astounding 32 wickets, leaving Australia all out for 264. India had a target of 155 to chase, and plenty of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> The only question was whether Australia's bowlers could get them out first. In 42 nail-biting overs, India steadily lost wickets, sinking to 135/7, a tantalising 20 runs short of victory, but in dire danger of losing their last batsmen before they could score them. The 8th wicket fell at 151, 4 runs short of victory, and it was left to wicket-keeper Sameer Dighe and Harbhajan Singh to see out the end. Harbhajan Singh scored the winning runs past point and sealed the game and an incredible comeback series victory for India. The series victory for India meant that Australia had still not won a series in India for over 30 years.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{appointed}} Marshall to the Supreme Court {{following the}} retirement of Justice Tom C. Clark, saying that this was [...] "the right thing to do, the right <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> the right man and the right place." [...] Marshall was confirmed as an Associate Justice by a Senate vote of 69–11 on August 31, 1967. Johnson confidently predicted to one biographer, Doris Kearns Goodwin, {{that a lot of}} black baby boys would be named [...] "Thurgood" [...] in honor of this choice (in fact, Kearns's research of birth records in New York and Boston indicates that Johnson's prophecy did not come true).|$|E
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there are some}} Cons in [...] "Ho-Ren-So". First, there is a cost of management. It {{needs a lot of}} <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> Thus, {{employees}} can not get enough <b>time</b> <b>to</b> complete their assigned work. Next, a subordinate always waits for an order from his/her manager. It prevents them from considering their tasks by themselves.|$|R

They’re guys that I’ve known for years, and great guitar players, but I’d like to put them in another environment, in a situation that they’ve never been in before. And I’d like to get some sax players—jazz players and other kinds. And I’ll definitely use Shankar Mahadevan, the amazing vocalist who appears on Remember Shakti’s Saturday Night in Bombay. I’ve been thinking about this underground thing for three years but I just haven’t had <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> I’m dying to get it out. It’s like giving birth." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the radio}} premiere of [...] "Say Somethin'", {{as well as}} the video release, MTV News {{reported}} that Carey would film a music video for [...] "Fly Like a Bird" [...] at the end of March2006. According to Carey, the video had already been conceptualized by mid-March, with a script featuring Carey, Keaton and a church choir as the main focuses. In a later interview, Carey said, [...] "We don't have a lot of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> It's not a big-budget thing. But it doesn't need to be. It just needs to be about the song, capturing the song and the emotion of it." [...] While plans for the video's filming were made, a final version was never released or commissioned.|$|E
500|$|Greg Jein {{had already}} {{been working on a}} new model of the USS Excelsior for the [...] "Flashback" [...] episode of Voyager when he saw the test footage for [...] "Trials and Tribble-ations". He promised to make a new model of the Enterprise too, but warned that he didn't know when he would have <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> He {{actually}} started work on it immediately, and together with his colleagues he not only built a [...] long model of the Enterprise, but created a new model of Deep Space Station K7 and the Klingon cruiser as well. The Enterprise model was the first to be built of the original Star Trek starship in more than 30 years. Other props were also recreated, with around 1,400 tribbles created for the various scenes. They were purchased from Lincoln Enterprises, a company set up by Majel Barrett, widow of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry. The rest of the era-specific props were newly created, and were made by Steve Horsch.|$|E

500|$|Batman: Arkham Knight was {{released}} on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows on June 23, 2015. The game was originally scheduled to be released on October 14, 2014, which in turn was delayed to June 2, 2015. On the first delay, Rocksteady marketing game manager Guy Perkins stated, [...] "If we didn’t give the team more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> then we would be releasing something that we weren’t happy with. We {{want to make sure}} we’re absolutely nailing it 100%." [...] A quality assurance tester for the game added, [...] "Getting [...] to work on consoles was impossible for months. That’s part of why the game got delayed so many times, [...] totally unprepared for how hard it was on next-gen consoles." [...] In the UK, the Microsoft Windows version is only available as a digital release. Additionally, an OS X and Linux version of the game developed by Feral Interactive was scheduled for release in early 2016 after originally being scheduled to release in late 2015; it was cancelled in February 2016. Feral stated the original delay was to [...] "ensure good performance and wide-ranging support" [...] for the two platforms.|$|E
500|$|According to David Prior, {{producer}} of the subsequent two-disc special edition, the initial bare bones edition [...] "was only reluctantly agreed to by Fincher because I needed {{more time on the}} bonus material. The studio was locked into their release date, so Fincher allowed that version to be released first. It {{had nothing to do with}} Fincher 'double dipping his own movie before it even makes it to stores' and everything to do with buying more time for the special edition". He stated that the theatrical cut would only be available on the single-disc edition. Prior elaborated further: [...] "Nobody wants fans feeling like they're being taken advantage of, and I know that double-dipping creates that impression. That's why it was so important to me that consumers be told there was another version coming. In this case it really was a rock-and-a-hard-place situation, and delaying the second release was done strictly for the benefit of the final product... But this is a very ambitious project, easily the most far-reaching I've ever worked on, and owing largely to studio snafus that I can't really elaborate on, I didn't have enough <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> properly. Thus Fincher bought me the extra time by agreeing to a staggered release, which I'm very grateful for". [...] In its first week, rentals for the DVD earned $6.7 million.|$|E
500|$|Also {{returning}} to the series are Neve McIntosh as Madame Vastra, Dan Starkey as Strax and Catrin Stewart as Jenny. All three previously appeared in [...] "A Good Man Goes to War" [...] and reprised their roles both in this episode and in the prequels. They returned due to the popularity of Vastra and Jenny; Moffat considered a spin-off featuring them, {{though he did not}} have the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> Instead, he decided to bring them back in the main series. Richard E. Grant had previously played the Doctor on two occasions, as an alternative Tenth Doctor in the spoof charity special Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death, which was written by Moffat and as an alternative Ninth Doctor in the animated story Scream of the Shalka which had been intended to be a continuation of the series before it was revived in 2005. Smith commented that Grant was [...] "born to be a Who villain. He pitches it on that perfect level and tone". Grant's appearance in Doctor Who was teased by the BBC via Twitter, announcing his appearance at midnight 5 August 2012. Tom Ward was drawn to his role because of the quality of the script, and also stated his young children were pleased that he appeared in the programme. The Great Intelligence was voiced by Sir Ian McKellen. The two children Clara is governess to, Digby and Francesca, were played by real-life brother and sister Joseph and Ellie Darcey-Alden.|$|E

[...] "We wanted to give ourselves plenty of <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> because we didn't {{want to go back and}} overdub anything, because then it wouldn't have been a real live album," [...] said Gregg Allman, and in the end, the band only edited out Doucette's harmonica when it didn't fit.

500|$|The WWF {{received}} some support {{from people who}} felt that the company {{did the right thing}} by continuing the event. Vince Russo, a WWF script writer at the time, pointed to the fact that Brian Pillman, a family friend of the Harts and a member of The Hart Foundation, died shortly before the [...] pay-per-view on which he was scheduled to perform in 1997. After learning of Pillman's death, both Bret and Owen Hart went ahead with their matches on the show. Russo claimed that this showed that [...] "the night he passed away I'm sure Owen would have wanted the same thing." [...] Vince McMahon refused to comment on Hart's death until he felt sufficient time had passed. When asked if he felt responsible for the accident, he replied, [...] "I have a lot to say and I will say it. I promise you that. But this is not the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it....</b> Give me a few days. Give me {{to the end of the}} week. Then we'll talk." [...] The day after Over the Edge, the WWF published a message in the Calgary Sun, stating, [...] "We do not have much information as to how it happened and will not know until an investigation is completed. We are all shaken, and to say Owen will be missed is to fall short of a way to fully explain what he meant to us." [...] Although the WWF had no information, they reported that [...] "Our thoughts and prayers go out to the entire Hart family. We have to be strong for Owen; he was an extraordinary human being and consummate performer and knows that the highest tribute that we can pay is to go on entertaining the fans he loved so much." ...|$|E
