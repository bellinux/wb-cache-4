40|$|To produce {{national}} banknotes a new <b>two-layer</b> <b>paper</b> will use. This paper {{produced by}} formaldehid-free technology. Using <b>two-layer</b> <b>paper</b> may differ physical and optical parameters {{of paper and}} as a result ? chroma, saturation and drying time of ink prints. Therefore, the use of new materials requires research on the impact parameters of these materials for printing, technical properties and the quality of printed products. As a result, it was investigated the influence of the structure, physical, mechanical and color characteristics of two-layer banknote paper, produced by formaldehid-free technology of printing, technical features and quality printed products for special purposes. Revealed that during the application of one type of ink with the same technological conditions, color prints on different paper is slightly different. Parts of the L*, a*, b* color model SIELab prints on a <b>two-layer</b> <b>paper</b> is more close to the components L*, a*, b* color. Thus, <b>two-layer</b> <b>paper</b> allows to get color prints with less deviation relative to ink, that is to ensure better color reproduction. In general, the color deviation between single- and <b>two-layer</b> <b>paper</b> with the same thickness of ink layer is negligible - not more than three ?E. Found that <b>two-layer</b> <b>paper</b> has better strength properties compared to single layer paper (greater number of double bends, more destructive efforts, etc.). Overall, <b>two-layer</b> <b>paper</b> strength indices higher than single-layer. Thus, the notes printed on a <b>two-layer</b> <b>paper</b> will be longer in circulation, which will save materials and production facilities Banknote coin factory. ?????????? ? ???????????? ??????-??????????????? ????????? ??????????? ???????? ?????? ? ??????. ??????????? ???????? ?????????????? ????????, ????????? ??????? ??????????? ???????? ???????? ?? ??????? ?????????? ????. ?????????? ??????????? ?????????? ????????? ???????? ?? ??????? ?????????? ????...|$|E
40|$|Proposed {{are simple}} and {{available}} techniques {{that can be}} used for rapid and reliable environmental control specifically of natural water by means of instrumental and visual tests in outdoor conditions. Developed are the chemical colorimetric modes for fast detection of socially dangerous trace impurities in water such as Co(II), Pd(II), and Rh(III) as well as NO 2 [...] ions and Fe(III) serving as model impurities. Application of portable digital devices and scanner allows estimating the color coordinates and increasing the accuracy and sensitivity of the tests. The combination of complex formation with preconcentration of colored complexes replaces the sensitive but time-consuming and capricious kinetic method that is usually used for this purpose at the more convenient and reliable colorimetric method. As the test tools, the following ones are worked out: polyurethane foam tablets with sorbed colored complexes, the <b>two-layer</b> <b>paper</b> sandwich packaged in slide adapter and saturated by reagents, and polyethylene terephthalate blister with dried reagents. Fast analysis of polyurethane foam tablets is realized using a pocket digital RGB-colorimeter or portable photometer. Express analysis of <b>two-layer</b> <b>paper</b> sandwich or polyethylene terephthalate blister is realized by visual and instrumental tests. The metrological characteristics of the developed visual and instrumental express analysis techniques are estimated...|$|E
40|$|Nanoparticles of {{partially}} imidized poly(styrene-maleic anhydride) {{were applied}} from an aqueous dispersion as a one- or <b>two-layer</b> coating onto <b>paper</b> substrates, for controlling the paper surface hydrophobicity {{and improving the}} water barrier resistance. The effect of deposition conditions and thermal treatments on the topography and {{properties of the coating}} was studied by scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), contact angle measurements, and friction measurements. The wettability of paper surfaces with adsorbed nanoparticles can be controlled by tuning the chemical and topographical surface parameters: the water contact angles were found to increase at higher imide content as determined by Raman spectroscopy (depending on synthesis and thermal treatment), and higher average surface roughness determined by AFM (depending on the deposition method). The present technique may serve as a unique replacement for chemical treatments hydrophobizing fibrous substrates...|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{improved}} interaction mechanism of <b>two-layer</b> model, this <b>paper</b> proposed Pixel Component Arranging and Comparing Algorithm (PCACA) and theoretically positioning algorithm, estimated the true temperature of mixed pixel in four extreme points {{in combination with}} the measurements of dry and wet points in calibration fields and improved the reliability of positioning dry and wet line. A new two-layer energy-separation algorithm was proposed, which was simple and direct without resistance network parameters for each pixel. We also proposed a new thought about the effect of advection. The albedo of mixed pixel was also separated with PCACA. In combination with two-layer energy-separation algorithm, the net radiation of mixed pixel was separated to overcome the uncertainty of conventional energy-separation algorithm using Beer's Law. Through the validation of retrieval result, this method is proved to be feasible and operational. At the same time, the uncertainty of this algorithm was objectively analyzed.
