40|$|Transmissive {{displays}} {{dominate the}} current portable display marketplace. However, {{there is significant}} room for improvement, because the average transmission efficiency of the leading commercial liquid crystal displays is less than 10 %. We introduce a reflector technique for increasing the transmission performance of back-lit electrowetting displays. The combination of the high efficiency reflector and electrowetting light valve can lead to transmission efficiencies exceeding 80 %. Presented here is a <b>transmissive</b> <b>display</b> technology utilizing electrowetting. Electrowetting is an electrical induced change in materials ’ wettability and has presented attractive application in display technology. In this thesis three generations of standard electrowetting displays have been developed. Contact angle measurements are performed for various thicknesses of hydrophobic fluoropolymer surface corresponding to different materials to optimize the best performance of electrowetting displays. Furthermore, electrowetting displays on thin film transistor and flexible substrates are also demonstrated. The novel technique presented here utilizes integrated reflectors an...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{development}} of consumer electronics and trend {{of reducing the}} size and weight of power supplies {{is becoming more and}} more important. The development of flat panel display technology, liquid crystal display (LCD) panels have become common. As the LCD panels are <b>transmissive</b> <b>displays,</b> they need backlight illuminations. To date, cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs) have been widely used as the backlight source for large LCD panels to provide the backlight illuminations. They are considered to be one of the best backlight sources when considering factors such as cost, efficiency, and uniformity ratio of illumination...|$|R
50|$|The E5-00 is {{very similar}} to the E72. It has more DRAM memory than the E72 but also has some {{important}} cost reductions. One cost reduction is the technology of the LCDs screen. The E5-00 has a <b>transmissive</b> LCD <b>display</b> while the E-72 has a transflective LCD. E5 supports only 256k display colors. Other important cost reductions are the removal of the secondary camera, the accelerometer and the digital compass. The third is the full focus for the camera, instead of autofocus.|$|R
40|$|Due {{to their}} large {{electric}} conductivity, stand-alone metallic films are highly reflective at microwave frequencies. For this reason, {{it is nearly}} impossible to observe Faraday rotation in ferromagnetic metal layers, even in films just tens of nanometers thick. Here, we show using numerical simulations that a stack of cobalt nano-layers interlaced between dielectric layers can become highly <b>transmissive</b> and <b>display</b> a large Faraday rotation in a finite frequency band. A 45 -degree Faraday rotation can be achieved with metallic ferromagnetic layers as thin as tens of nanometers. Comment: 4 Figure...|$|R

40|$|Under NASA {{guidance}} {{an advanced}} development helmet mounted display (HMD) {{has been designed}} and fabricated. Delivery {{has been made of}} an extravehicular mobility unit (EMU) HMD demonstration unit {{as an alternative to the}} current low-resolution, chest-mounted display, and cuff-mounted checklists. Important design goals achieved with this HMD include the use of <b>transmissive</b> liquid <b>display</b> image sources with fairly high resolution (text, graphics, and video compatible), binocular viewing with total image overlap, virtual image projection, low profile packaging, low power design, and demonstration of voice control of the HMD data. Test results showed that the HMD program successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the concept and operated as designed, meeting the necessary program requirements...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} {{systematic}} photometric study of LCD based on quantum dot (QD) backlight, {{and find the}} optimal emission spectrum combination in terms of system efficiency and wide color gamut. A QD-based LCD has potential to achieve 120 % AdobeRGB color gamut in CIE 1931 and 140 % in CIE 1976 color space, while keeping the same energy efficiency as conventional backlights. Moreover, we present a <b>transmissive</b> color <b>display</b> based on voltage-stretchable liquid crystal droplet and quantum dot backlight. This polarizer-free display exhibits highly saturated colors, wide viewing angle and reasonably good contrast ratio. QD backlight allows LCD to display original colors with high fidelity, which makes LCD more competitive to organic LED. The prime time for QD-enhanced LCDs is near...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Antiferroelectric liquid {{crystals}} (AFLCs) have a {{great potential}} for high resolution displays for computers and video. We have earlier shown [1 - 3] that the contrast of <b>transmissive</b> mode AFLC <b>displays</b> is optimized by using materials with a molecular tilt angle of essentially 45 °, i. e. orthoconic materials. In this paper we show that such materials also open up for high contrast reflective AFLC displays which cannot be realized with conventional AFLCs. From a general optics treatment of AFLCs in reflective configurations we describe the evolution from a normally white to a normally black mode {{by the use of}} a passive quarter wave retarder...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop an optical method of leak detection. Various modifications of schlieren optics were explored with initial emphasis on leak detection of the plumbing within the orbital maneuvering system of the space shuttle (OMS pod). The schlieren scheme envisioned for OMS pod leak detection was that of a high contrast pattern on flexible reflecting material imaged onto a negative of the same pattern. We find that the OMS pod geometry constrains the characteristic length scale of the pattern to the order of 0. 001 inch. Our experiments suggest that optical modulation transfer efficiency will be very low for such patterns, which will limit the sensitivity of the technique. Optical elements which allow a negative of the scene to be reversibly recorded using light from the scene itself were explored for their potential in adaptive single-ended schlieren systems. Elements studied include photochromic glass, bacteriorhodopsin, and a <b>transmissive</b> liquid crystal <b>display.</b> The dynamics of writing and reading patterns were studied using intensity profiles from recorded images. Schlieren detection of index gradients in air was demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Conjugated {{polymers}} (CP) display several interesting properties which {{enable them}} their application in different {{fields such as}} solar cells, light emitting diodes, field effect transistors, electrochromic devices to cite a few. One of the most interesting properties of this class of materials is their ability of switching from a conductive to an insulating state and vice versa by changing their redox state. The possibility to switch from an oxidized to a neutral or reduced state induces variations of the optical spectrum due to changes in the electron excitation energy configuration resulting in electrochromism. Nowadays, electrochromic conjugated polymers are stimulating the development of transmissive and reflective technologies such as <b>transmissive</b> and reflective <b>displays,</b> smart windows, e-papers, optical memories, and optical shutters. In this work we prepared and investigated the electrochromic properties of a new, air stable polythiophene derivative, namely poly-naphthalenediimidequaterthiophene (PNDIT 4). PNDIT 4 thin films have been obtained by the electrochemical oxidation of the chemically synthesized monomer on transparent ITO electrodes supported on PET in two solvents mixtures having different volume ratios. The morphological and chemical investigation of the thin film have been performed by a number of surface tools including microscopy and spectroscopy techniques allowing to correlate their structure with the electrochromic performances. Spectroelectrochemical experiments have been performed in a two electrodes electrochemical cell endowed with quartz windows. Both absorbance spectra under different polarization potentials and transmittance vs time plots under different excitation wavelengths have been recorded. Figure 1 shows a typical optical contrast of a PNDIT 4 film on ITO, obtained by applying a square wave potential of ± 0. 8 V (anode vs cathode) at 900 nm. The polymer displayed a colour variation from green to beige when switched from the doped to the undoped states, respectively, along with a good optical memory in the explored time interval...|$|R
