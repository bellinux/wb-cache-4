40|$|AbstractChildren with {{cerebral}} palsy participate less in everyday activities than children in <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>populations.</b> During adolescence, rapid physical and psychological changes occur which may be more difficult for adolescents with impairments. Within the European SPARCLE project we measured frequency of participation of adolescents with {{cerebral palsy}} by administering the Questionnaire of Young People's Participation to 667 adolescents {{with cerebral palsy}} or their parents from nine European regions and to 4666 adolescents from <b>the</b> corresponding <b>general</b> <b>populations.</b> Domains and single items were analysed using respectively linear and logistic regression. Adolescents with cerebral palsy spent less time with friends and had less autonomy in their daily life than adolescents in <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>populations.</b> Adolescents with cerebral palsy participated much less in sport but played electronic games at least as often as adolescents in <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>populations.</b> Severity of motor and intellectual impairment {{had a significant impact}} on frequency of participation, the more severely impaired being more disadvantaged. Adolescents with an only slight impairment participated in some domains as often as adolescents in <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>populations.</b> Regional variation existed. For example adolescents with cerebral palsy in central Italy were most disadvantaged according to decisional autonomy, while adolescents with cerebral palsy in east Denmark and northern England played sports as often as their <b>general</b> <b>populations.</b> Participation is an important health outcome. Personal and environmental predictors of participation of adolescents with cerebral palsy need to be identified in order to design interventions directed to such predictors; and in order to inform the content of services...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the incidence of}} retinal vein occlusion (RVO) in pregnant women and in the subpopulation of pregnant women with pre-eclampsia/eclampsia compared to that in <b>the</b> age-matched <b>general</b> female <b>population</b> {{to determine if there}} is increased risk of RVO in pregnancy. Nationwide population-based retrospective study using data entered into the Korean national health claims database from 2007 to 2011. Of the incident RVO cases in the database, RVO cases that occurred during the pregnancy-associated period, which spanned a 52 -week period from 40 -weeks-before to 12 -weeks-after childbirth, were identified. Of these cases, the presence of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia was determined. The standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of RVO in <b>the</b> <b>general</b> pregnant <b>population</b> and in the pregnant population with pre-eclampsia/eclampsia were determined with respect to <b>the</b> age-matched <b>general</b> female <b>population.</b> Pregnancy-related RVO was identified in 33 cases from the 1. 8 million women who experience childbirth during the study period, while the expected number of cases calculated by the direct standardization to <b>the</b> age-matched <b>general</b> <b>population</b> was 113. Of the 33 patients, 12 patients (36. 4 %) had pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. The SIR for <b>the</b> <b>general</b> pregnant <b>population</b> in reference to <b>the</b> age-matched <b>general</b> female <b>population</b> was 0. 29 (95 % CI, 0. 20 - 0. 41).
