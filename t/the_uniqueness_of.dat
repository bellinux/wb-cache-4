5|$|Motion, {{the process}} of movement, is {{described}} using specific anatomical terms. Motion includes movement of organs, joints, limbs, and specific sections of the body.

5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, the school's population, {{academic}} program, and building {{were all in}} decline, in part reflecting the economic problems {{of the city as}} a whole. In 1977, the city school system allocated money to refurbish the school and bolster the college preparatory program. That same year the school system announced its intent to make City College coeducational; however, the all-male tradition did not end easily. Alumni argued for <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> <b>of</b> a single-sex education system, and a task force studying the issue voted 11–6 in favor of keeping the all-male tradition. In a stunning reversal, the board of school commissioners voted to admit women citing constitutional concerns over equal rights. The following year City College enrolled women for the first time.|$|E

5|$|Cantor's {{theory of}} transfinite numbers was {{originally}} regarded as so counter-intuitive – even shocking – that it encountered resistance from mathematical contemporaries such as Leopold Kronecker and Henri Poincaré and later from Hermann Weyl and L.

Some Christian theologians (particularly neo-Scholastics) saw Cantor's work {{as a challenge to}} <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> <b>of</b> the absolute infinity in the nature of God – on one occasion equating the theory of transfinite numbers with pantheism – a proposition that Cantor vigorously rejected.|$|E

It is the most complete and best preserved juvenile example known to date.

Hicks joined the project after discovering Ellie's role in the game, considering her an unusual character to include in a survival horror game. The comic's art style is different than the game art—a choice from Hicks to give the comic a unique feel and identity.|$|E

5|$|The {{beautiful}} nuthatch {{was first}} described in 1843 by British zoologist Edward Blyth, from a specimen he examined in Darjeeling.

5|$|In a 1976 referendum, New Jersey voters {{approved}} casino gambling in Atlantic City. Because {{of concerns about}} organized crime connections to gambling, New Jersey enacted strict regulations that included licensing of all casino employees and contractors, and a separation of powers between the Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) and the Casino Control Commission (CCC). The Division of Gaming Enforcement {{is part of the}} New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety, and is responsible for investigating casino license applications, monitoring casino operations, and enforcing New Jersey's casino laws and regulations as defined in Title 5, Chapter 12 of New Jersey's statutes, and Title 13, Chapter 69I of New Jersey's Administrative Code. The Casino Control Commission is an independent agency in the state Treasury Department with both quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial powers, and is responsible for creating casino regulations, hearing appeals of DGE penalties, and make decisions on casino licensing.

5|$|International {{treaties}} may {{be necessary}} for such objectives as the setting up of marine reserves. Another international agreement, the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, protects animals that migrate across the globe and need protection {{in more than one}} country. However, the protection of habitats needs {{to take into account the}} needs of the local residents for food, fuel and other resources. Even where legislation protects the environment, a lack of enforcement often prevents effective protection. Faced with food shortage, a farmer is likely to plough up a level patch of ground despite it being the last suitable habitat for an endangered species such as the San Quintin kangaroo rat, and even kill the animal as a pest. In this regard, it is desirable to educate the community on <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> <b>of</b> their flora and fauna and the benefits of ecotourism.|$|E
