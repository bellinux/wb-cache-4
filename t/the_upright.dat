5|$|The {{top floor}} of the mill is the dust floor. It could be used for storage of grain and gives {{internal}} access to the cap. The cast-iron wallower, which is driven by the brake wheel is carried at the top of <b>the</b> <b>upright</b> shaft, in the centre of the mill.|$|E
5|$|At low forward speeds, the {{precession}} of {{the front}} wheel is too quick, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to oversteer, start to lean {{the other way and}} eventually oscillate and fall over. At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to understeer and eventually fall over without ever having reached <b>the</b> <b>upright</b> position. This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is easy for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled.|$|E
5|$|Combs {{created a}} rap {{supergroup}} in 2010 {{known as the}} Dream Team. The group consists of Combs, Rick Ross, DJ Khaled, Fat Joe, Busta Rhymes, Red Café, and Fabolous. Combs made an appearance at comedian Chris Gethard's live show in January 2010 at <b>the</b> <b>Upright</b> Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York City. In June 2010 Combs played a role (credited as Sean Combs) in the comedy film Get Him to the Greek, as Sergio Roma, a record company executive. An Entourage series representative announced that Combs would guest star on an episode during the 2010 season.|$|E

30|$|Further goal {{included}} recovering {{enough space}} for prosthetic {{replacement of the}} missing lower left first molar. This objective would have been achieved by reciprocal movements of <b>the</b> <b>uprighting</b> of <b>the</b> second lower left molar and by mesial movement of the left premolars to level the lower arch. In order to enable <b>the</b> <b>uprighting</b> of <b>the</b> 3.7, the lower left third molar was extracted. The maintenance of 3.8 was considered; however, <b>the</b> <b>uprighting</b> of 3.7 {{was thought to be}} faster and more predictable without the third molar.|$|R
5|$|Robotron: 2084 was commercially successful; Williams sold {{approximately}} 19,000arcade cabinets, and mini {{cabinets and}} cocktail versions were later produced. The different arcade versions have since become {{varying levels of}} rarity; the cocktail and cabaret versions are very rare, while <b>the</b> <b>upright</b> cabinets are more available.

5|$|The fantail was made. Some of {{the small}} gears were replaced. The stocks were made from pitch pine and the blades from Douglas fir. Work at the mill over the winter {{included}} repairs to the brickwork and windows, with only one window still needing attention when the first work-in began. New beech cogs were fitted to the crown wheel, which was restored to its correct position on <b>the</b> <b>upright</b> shaft.|$|E
5|$|On <b>the</b> <b>upright</b> {{collar of}} full generals, {{lieutenant}} generals, major generals, and brigadier generals three stars were stitched within a wreath, all embroidered in gold coloring. The center star was {{slightly larger than}} the other stars. It {{was not possible to}} know which grade of general an officer was by his collar insignia. However, major generals and lieutenant generals wore two rows of nine buttons in groups of three down the front of the overcoat, and brigadier generals wore two rows of eight buttons in groups of two. However, Confederate Army Regulations had no distinction between the general officer grades, and had only the insignia for brigadier generals recognized. At least three general officers did not wear the prescribed uniform: Robert E. Lee, who wore the uniform of a colonel, refusing to wear a general's insignia until the Confederate victory; Joseph L. Hogg, who died of a fever; and Benjamin McCulloch.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{automation}} level of wrecker, fuzzy PID controller for <b>the</b> <b>uprighting</b> was proposed. First, <b>the</b> <b>uprighting</b> model was built in this article. Then, the hydraulic circuit of wrecker uprighting system was built in AMESim. Furthermore, the fuzzy PID controller and the conventional PID controller were simulated respectively in Matlab software based on this model. Simulation {{results show that the}} fuzzy PID controller has faster step response speed and smaller overshoot than that of the conventional PID controller. <b>The</b> <b>uprighting</b> can be accomplished automatically and smoothly by virtue of the fuzzy PID controller...|$|R
50|$|In most {{forms of}} {{gridiron}} football, a place kick that travels through <b>the</b> <b>uprights</b> {{is a field}} goal worth three points; on a free play following a touchdown, it is worth one point.

5|$|South-west of {{the town}} is the Friar's Oven SSSI which {{is the site of}} herb-rich {{calcareous}} grassland classified as <b>the</b> <b>Upright</b> Brome (Bromus erectus) type, and north-east is the Windsor Hill Quarry geological SSSI, and also the Windsor Hill Marsh biological SSSI, a marshy silted pond with adjacent damp, slightly acidic grassland of interest for its diverse flora, in large part down to the varied habitats present within the small area. Two species are present which are rare in Somerset: Flat-sedge (Blysmus compressus) and Slender Spike-rush (Eleocharis uniglumis). Other marshland plants found there include Purple Loosestrife, Yellow Flag (Iris pseudacorus), Hard Rush (Juncus inflexus), Soft Rush (J. effusus), Flowering Rush (Butomus umbellatus), Devil's-bit Scabious (Succisa pratensis), three species of Horsetail Equisetum spp. and seven sedges Carex spp.|$|E
5|$|Space Invaders {{was first}} {{released}} in a cocktail-table format {{with black and}} white graphics, while the Western release by Midway was in an upright cabinet format. <b>The</b> <b>upright</b> cabinet uses strips of orange and green cellophane over the screen to simulate color graphics. The graphics are reflected onto a painted backdrop of a moon against a starry background. Later Japanese releases used rainbow-colored cellophane, such as T.T. Space Invaders in 1978, followed by a version with a full-color display. The cabinet artwork features large humanoid monsters not present in the game. Nishikado attributes this to the artist basing the designs on the original title, Space Monsters, rather than referring to the in-game graphics.|$|E
5|$|The blood shift causes an {{increased}} respiratory and cardiac workload. Stroke volume is not greatly affected by immersion or variation in ambient pressure, but slowed heartbeat reduces the overall cardiac output, particularly {{because of the}} diving reflex in breath-hold diving. Lung volume decreases in <b>the</b> <b>upright</b> position, owing to cranial displacement of the abdomen from hydrostatic pressure, and {{resistance to air flow}} in the airways increases because of the decrease in lung volume. There appears to be a connection between pulmonary edema and increased pulmonary blood flow and pressure, which results in capillary engorgement. This may occur during higher intensity exercise while immersed or submerged.|$|E

5000|$|Point After Touchdown: The {{opponent}} {{holds his}} fingers in the goalpost position, and the scoring player flicks the ball through the air. The attempt is successful {{so long as the}} center of the ball travels through the imaginary area over the bottom fingers and between <b>the</b> <b>uprights,</b> even if <b>the</b> ball bounces off <b>the</b> <b>uprights</b> (but continues through the scoring area) in the process.|$|R
5|$|The {{incompletion}} on 3rd down {{stopped the}} clock with 2:11 {{left in the}} game. The field goal attempt was placed from 39 yards away, which is not considered a particularly difficult field goal distance by NFL standards. Because the game was played indoors at the Metrodome, there were no adverse weather conditions that might have affected the kick. The ball was snapped on 4th down with punter Mitch Berger holding. The Vikings faced a heavy rush from cornerback Michael Booker {{on the left side}} of the line of scrimmage and cornerbacks Ronnie Bradford and Ray Buchanan on the right, who ran into Anderson and knocked him to the ground after the kick. The ball sailed about a foot wide left of <b>the</b> <b>upright</b> with 2:07 left on the game clock. Afterward, Anderson stood with arms akimbo on the field momentarily before heading to the sideline, as Falcons players celebrated around him.|$|E
5|$|The {{stage of}} the Kaiserkeller was made of planks of wood {{balanced}} {{on the top of}} beer crates, so the two groups made a bet to see to who {{would be the first to}} break it. After punishing the stage for days, a slight crack appeared, and when Storm jumped off the top of <b>the</b> <b>upright</b> piano it finally broke. Johnny 'Guitar' Byrne remembered that as Storm hit the stage, it cracked loudly and formed a V-shape around him. He disappeared into it, and all the amplifiers and drummer Ringo Starr's cymbals slid into the hole. Koschmider was furious, and had to replace the live music with a juke box. Both groups went across the road to Harold's cafe for breakfast on the Grosse Freiheit, but were followed by Koschmider's doormen, armed with coshes, who beat them all as punishment.|$|E

Swift {{is dressed in a}} fitted pastel sundress and plays an acoustic guitar strapped over her shoulder. The backup musicians play the fiddle,the piano, the drum set, and <b>the</b> <b>upright</b> bass. The video then transitions to a clip from Hannah Montana: The Movie in which Miley Stewart (Cyrus) spots her love interest, Travis Brody (Lucas Till), riding a brown horse. The video alternates between Swift performing and more film clips. Other scenes include Stewart and Brody riding the brown horse together, Stewart staring out from a red car into the street, Brody swinging from a rope in a waterfall, and the two characters on a date. At the end of the video, the couple are slow dancing while Swift sings.|$|E

5|$|Ecclestone held BMW {{to their}} {{contract}} for the 1987 season, but the German company would only supply the laydown engine. <b>The</b> <b>upright</b> units, around which Brabham had designed their new car, were sold {{for use by the}} Arrows team. Senior figures at Brabham, including Murray, have admitted that by this stage Ecclestone had lost interest in running the team. The 1987 season was only slightly more successful than the previous year—Patrese and de Cesaris scoring 10 points between them, including two third places at the Belgian Grand Prix and the Mexican Grand Prix. Unable to locate a suitable engine supplier, the team missed the FIA deadline for entry into the 1988 world championship and Ecclestone finally announced the team's withdrawal from Formula One at the Brazilian Grand Prix in April 1988. During the season ending Australian Grand Prix, Ecclestone announced he had sold MRD to EuroBrun team owner Walter Brun for an unknown price.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the game}} was slow to gain popularity. Defender did not attract much {{attention}} at the 1980 AMOA show. In retrospect, Jarvis believed many passersby were intimidated by its complexity. The game, however, was well received in arcades, and crowds gathered around the cabinet during its first nights of play testing. The success spurred Williams to release a cocktail version as well. Defender eventually became Williams' best selling arcade game, with over 55,000units sold worldwide. By 2004, {{the game was}} a popular collector's item; <b>the</b> <b>upright</b> cabinets were common, while the cocktail models were more rare. Since its release, it {{has become one of}} the highest grossing arcade games ever, earning over US$1billion. Williams employee Larry Demar was surprised at the game's popularity, stating that it was the only game he'd seen able to earn that quantity of quarters. Six months after its release, the game was one of the top earners in the United States video game industry. Mark Stearny of JoyStik magazine called Defender the most successful game in 1981, commenting that it outperformed Pac-Man.|$|E
5|$|The Ravens' first regular-season {{win over}} the Patriots came on September 23, 2012. The game was {{emotional}} as receiver Torrey Smith was competing {{following the death of}} his brother in a motorcycle accident just the night before. Smith caught two touchdowns in a back and forth game; the Ravens erased a 13–0 lead {{in the first half and}} led 14–13, but the Patriots scored at the end of the second quarter for a 20–14 lead. The lead changed twice in the third quarter and the Patriots led 30–21 in the fourth, but the Ravens scored on Smith's second touchdown catch. The Ravens were stopped on fourth down but the Patriots had to punt; in the final two minutes a pass interference penalty on Devin McCourty put the ball at the Patriots 7-yard line; new Ravens kicker Justin Tucker booted a 27-yard field goal on the final play; the ball sailed directly over <b>the</b> <b>upright</b> and was ruled good; the quality of officiating by replacement referees caused controversy as Bill Belichick angrily reached for one of the referees as they were leaving the field, leading to a $50,000 fine later that week.|$|E

5000|$|In {{its most}} {{familiar}} form, the illusion uses an apparatus which generally resembles {{the type of}} guillotine historically used for executions.

The inner faces of <b>the</b> <b>uprights</b> contain tracks within which runs a blade, and the upper end of <b>the</b> <b>uprights</b> supports a mechanism for raising, holding and then releasing the blade. In some versions of the illusion, the apparatus also has a bench attached to <b>the</b> <b>uprights</b> at <b>the</b> same level as the neck stocks, on which the [...] "victim" [...] lies down - usually in a face-down position. On other versions, the [...] "victim" [...] simply kneels behind the apparatus and places their neck in the stocks.|$|R
5|$|The Song {{judicial}} system retained {{most of the}} legal code of the earlier Tang dynasty, the basis of traditional Chinese law up until the modern era. Roving sheriffs maintained {{law and order in}} the municipal jurisdictions and occasionally ventured into the countryside. Official magistrates overseeing court cases were not only expected to be well-versed in written law but also to promote morality in society. Magistrates such as the famed Bao Qingtian (999–1062) embodied <b>the</b> <b>upright,</b> moral judge who upheld justice and never {{failed to live up to}} his principles. Song judges specified the guilty person or party in a criminal act and meted out punishments accordingly, often in the form of caning. A guilty individual or parties brought to court for a criminal or civil offense were not viewed as wholly innocent until proven otherwise, while even accusers were viewed with a high level of suspicion by the judge. Due to costly court expenses and immediate jailing of those accused of criminal offences, people in the Song preferred to settle disputes and quarrels privately, without the court's interference.|$|E
5|$|The fantail and {{associated}} gearing was fitted to the mill. At {{the end of}} the second work-in, the cap could be turned by means of the hand crank. The fantail itself, with the blades painted red, white and blue was installed shortly afterwards. The clasp arm brake wheel was assembled around the windshaft. It was found that the wallower was eccentric on <b>the</b> <b>upright</b> shaft by ½ inch (13mm). When this was corrected the brake wheel was within 1/16 th of an inch (less than 1mm) of true. The clamps for the stocks were sawn from a baulk of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year. Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors, cleaning and painting ironwork and further repointing on the brickwork. The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at {{the end of the}} second work-in. The stock, with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the windshaft and when wedged in position and the clamps had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock. The process was repeated for the second pair of sails. The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work-in.|$|E
