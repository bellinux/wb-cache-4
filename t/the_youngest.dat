40|$|This study {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} the suitability of <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> generation family members in small and medium-sized family businesses to successfully manage the business after management succession. Data from 270 questionnaires linked to 77 family businesses were collected and analysed. An Oblimin oblique rotation was performed on the principal components of the exploratory factor analysis. Five factors with eigen-values greater than one, explaining 65, 78 % of the variance, were extracted. These five factors describing the theoretical dimensions of the dependent variable, the suitability of <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> generation to manage the family business after succession, and the independent variables, namely value adding by <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> generation, willingness of <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> generation, credibility of <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> generation and <b>the</b> degree of self-empowerment by <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> generation family members.

60|$|We were {{no sooner}} fairly off, than <b>the</b> <b>young</b> ladies' young gentleman hummed a {{fragment}} of an air, which induced a young lady to inquire whether he had danced to that the night before.

At length, a short silence occurring, <b>the</b> <b>young</b> ladies on either side of <b>the</b> <b>young</b> gentleman fell suddenly fast asleep; and <b>the</b> <b>young</b> gentleman, winking upon us to preserve silence, won a pair of gloves from each, thereby causing them to wake with equal suddenness and to scream very loud.
