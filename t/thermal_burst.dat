40|$|We {{present a}} study of 581 Hz {{oscillations}} observed during a thermonuclear X-ray burst from the low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) 4 U 1636 - 54 with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). This is the first X-ray burst to exhibit both millisecond oscillations during the rising phase as well as photospheric radius expansion. We measure an oscillation amplitude within 0. 1 s of the onset of this burst of 75 ± 17 %, that is, almost the entire <b>thermal</b> <b>burst</b> flux is modulated near onset. The spectral evolution during the rising phase of this burst suggests that the X-ray emitting area on the neutron star was increasing, similar to the behavior of bursts from 4 U 1728 - 34 with 363 Hz oscillations reported recently. We argue {{that the combination of}} large pulsed amplitudes near burst onset and the spectral evidence for localized emission during the rise strongly supports rotational modulation as the mechanism for the oscillations. We discuss how theoretical interpretation of spin modulation amplitudes, pulse profiles and pulse phase spectroscopy can provide constraints on the masses and radii of neutron stars. We also discuss the implications of these findings for the beat frequency models of kHz X-ray variability in LMXB...|$|E

The paper presents experimentally substantiated conceptual model of a mechanism for electric conductivity of vapor-gas envelope. According to the model an electric current passing in the envelope and having quasi-constant and high-frequency components is provided by ionic conductivity in electrolyte envelope-enclosing bridges and ionic conductivity in gas envelope phase. It {{has been shown that}} quasi-constant of the current component represents a composition of electric current consisting of overlapping time current impulses from electrolyte bridges that enclose the envelope with frequency of 0. 01 − 0. 90 kHz and current in a gas phase of the envelope. High-frequency current component is pre-conditioned by ionic conductivity in bridges that commutate the envelope with frequency of 2. 5 MHz. The paper theoretically substantiates excessive electrical conductivity of electrolyte in the electrolyte bridges. It has been demonstrated that formation of vapor-gas envelope and its renovation are connected with <b>thermal</b> <b>burst</b> mechanism for destruction of electrolyte bridges. Envelope vibration and hydrodynamic flows within the electrolyte occur due to impulse wave impact on electrolyte layer which is on the border of the envelope.

40|$|Aims. We {{evaluate}} {{thermal stresses}} in small, spherical, and homogeneous meteoroids with elastic rheology and regular rotation. The temperature variations {{are caused by}} the absorbed sunlight energy being conducted into the interior layers of the body. Our model assumes arbitrary thermal conductivity value, but restricts itself to a linearized treatment of the boundary conditions of the heat diffusion problem. We consider the diurnal insolation cycle only as if the body were in a fixed position along its heliocentric orbit. This constrains the upper limit to the object size to which our modeling is applicable. Methods. We derive analytical expressions for {{the components of the}} thermal stress tensor throughout the body. Using two sets of material properties (ordinary and carbonaceous chondrites), we study the conditions required for material failure caused by thermal stress leading to fission. Results. Our results indicate that the onset of thermal failure in the meteoroid depends on a number of parameters including the heliocentric distance, the size, the rotation frequency, and the orientation of the spin axis with respect to the solar direction. In our case, we find large, centimeter- to meter-size, slowly rotating meteoroids or those with a spin axis pointing towards the Sun or both, are the most susceptible to the <b>thermal</b> <b>bursting.</b> This may have implications for the (i) size distribution of meteoroids in various streams depending on their heliocentric orbit and the physical characteristics of their parent bodies; (ii) orbital distribution of sporadic complexes of meteoroids in the planet-crossing zone; and/or (iii) fate of fragments released during comet disintegration events, especially those with low perihelia (e. g., Kreutz class).

40|$|We {{develop a}} new {{sub-grid}} model {{for the growth of}} supermassive Black Holes (BHs) and their associated Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback in hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. Assuming that BHs are created {{in the early stages of}} galaxy formation, they grow by mergers and accretion of gas at a Eddington-limited Bondi accretion rate. However this growth is regulated by AGN feedback which we model using two different modes: a quasar-heating mode when accretion rates onto the BHs are comparable to the Eddington rate, and a radio-jet mode at lower accretion rates. In other words, our feedback model deposits energy as a succession of <b>thermal</b> <b>bursts</b> and jet outflows depending on the properties of the gas surrounding the BHs. We assess the plausibility of such a model by comparing our results to observational measurements of the coevolution of BHs and their host galaxy properties, and check their robustness with respect to numerical resolution. We show that AGN feedback must be a crucial physical ingredient for the formation of massive galaxies as it appears to be the only physical mechanism able to efficiently prevent the accumulation of and/or expel cold gas out of halos/galaxies and significantly suppress star formation. Our model predicts that the relationship between BHs and their host galaxy mass evolves as a function of redshift, because of the vigorous accretion of cold material in the early Universe that drives Eddington-limited accretion onto BHs. Quasar activity is also enhanced at high redshift. However, as structures grow in mass and lose their cold material through star formation and efficient BH feedback ejection, the AGN activity in the low-redshift Universe becomes more and more dominated by the radio mode, which powers jets through the hot circum-galactic medium.

40|$|We {{develop a}} subgrid {{model for the}} growth of supermassive black holes (BHs) and their {{associated}} active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback in hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. This model transposes previous attempts to describe BH accretion and AGN feedback with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique to the adaptive mesh refinement framework. It also furthers their development by implementing a new jet-like outflow treatment of the AGN feedback which we combine with the heating mode traditionally used in the SPH approach. Thus, our approach allows one to test the robustness of the conclusions derived from simulating the impact of self-regulated AGN feedback on galaxy formation vis-à-vis the numerical method. Assuming that BHs are created {{in the early stages of}} galaxy formation, they grow by mergers and accretion of gas at a Eddington-limited Bondi accretion rate. However this growth is regulated by AGN feedback which we model using two different modes: a quasar-heating mode when accretion rates on to the BHs are comparable to the Eddington rate, and a radio-jet mode at lower accretion rates which not only deposits energy, but also deposits mass and momentum on the grid. In other words, our feedback model deposits energy as a succession of <b>thermal</b> <b>bursts</b> and jet outflows depending on the properties of the gas surrounding the BHs.

40|$|Abstract: The most {{promising}} technique {{for reducing the}} weight of cooling systems for burst-mode thermal loads is by reducing the chiller size. Addition of thermal storage provides the means to achieve this weight reduction. The heat reservoir must be designed to absorb high peak thermal powers as well as having a large energy storage capacity. Storing energy as phase-change latent-heat, rather than as temperature-change sensible-heat, results in {{a significant increase in}} storage capacity. Distributing the heat through a large volume is achieved by imbedding the phase-change-material (PCM) in a porous, high thermal-conductivity matrix. When the heat load is cyclical, even higher peak power capabilities can be achieved by first absorbing the heat in a small quantity of water and then transferring it to the PCM between heating pulses. We developed high-power, high-energy dual-material heat-reservoirs consisting of graphite-porous plates impregnated with paraffin PCM combined with water in order to cool <b>bursts</b> of <b>thermal</b> pulses. The <b>bursts</b> consisted of multiple, short, high-power heating pulses followed by longer interpulse periods. Bursts were followed by longer recovery period during which the small chiller extracted energy from the Paraffin. Measurements were made to characterize the cooling performance of water-PCM graphite reservoirs under continuous and <b>burst</b> <b>thermal</b> loads, and they were compared to a theoretical model. The main conclusions are that the measurements agree well with the model and that substantial weight reduction of burst-mode cooling-systems can be achieved by using the water plus PCM graphite heat-reservoir.

40|$|We {{construct}} a two-zone model to describe {{hydrogen and helium}} burning {{on the surface of}} an accreting neutron star and use it to study the triggering of type I X-ray bursts. Although highly simplified, the model reproduces all of the bursting regimes seen in the more complete global linear stability analysis of Narayan & Heyl (2003), including the regime of delayed mixed bursts. The results are also consistent with observations of type I X-ray bursts. At low accretion rates ˙M / ˙MEdd � 0. 1, thermonuclear helium burning via the well-known thin-shell <b>thermal</b> instability triggers <b>bursts.</b> As ˙M increases, however, the trigger mechanism evolves from the fast thermal instability to a slowly growing overstability involving both hydrogen and helium burning. The competition between nuclear heating via the β-limited CNO cycle and the triple-α process on the one hand, and radiative cooling via photon diffusion and emission on the other hand, drives oscillations with a period approximately equal to the hydrogen-burning timescale. If these oscillations grow, the gradually rising temperature {{at the base of the}} helium layer eventually provokes a thin-shell thermal instability and hence a delayed mixed burst. This overstability closely resembles the delayed mixed bursts of Narayan & Heyl. For ˙M / ˙MEdd � 0. 25 there is no instability or overstability, and there are no bursts.

In terms of the mean free path for the slow bulk electrons, lambda(s), the nonlocal effects are important whenever lambda(s) /L greater than 0. 001, with the following consequences. The heat flux in the hot part of the gradient is reduced relative to the Spitzer-Haerm value q(SH) which {{does not take into account}} the heat carried away by the fast electrons. The heat flux in the cold part of the gradient is enhanced relative to the value q(SH) which does not take into account the heat deposited by the fast electrons.

The barrier to insertion on the O(D- 1) +D- 2 potential energy surface in solid D- 2 is explained as a many-body polarization effect.

There was no influence of thermal acclimation on the burst swimming performance of female G. holbrooki over the range 18 – 30 °C; however, sustained swimming performance was significantly lower in the warm- than the cool-acclimation group. For mating behaviour, we tested the hypothesis that acclimation would enhance the ability of female G. holbrooki to avoid forced matings at their host acclimation temperature relative to females acclimated to another environment. However, our hypothesis was not supported. The rate of copulations was almost three times greater for females acclimated to 30 °C than 18 °C when tested at 30 °C, indicating that they possess the ability to alter their avoidance behaviour to ‘allow’ more copulations in some environments.
