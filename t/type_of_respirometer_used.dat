40|$|Dynamic {{interactions}} between biological respiration and denitrification, and physical transport processes that modify the abiotic soil {{environment in which}} bacteria live, were studied through the development <b>of</b> a new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> experimental <b>respirometer</b> system and an explanatory simulation model. The respirometer system enables one to measure simultaneously the distribution of water, oxygen, nitrate, ammonium, and pH {{as a function of}} space and time in an unsaturated, artificially made, homogeneous, cylindrical soil aggregate. The coherent data sets that were obtained by this experimental system served to test the explanatory simulation model. The simulation model comprises four submodels: 1) biological respiration and denitrification, 2) water transport including a description to account for hysteresis, 3) solute transport, and 4) gas transport including a new description to simulate the integral soil atmosphere. Besides evaluation of the integral model with the results <b>of</b> the <b>respirometer</b> system, three <b>of</b> the submodels were also separately tested, either by means of experiments (submodel 1 and 2) or by analytical solutions (a special case of submodel 4). It was found that the new respirometer system yields valuable data to test the simulation model, and that the simulation model gives a fair description of the measured data. However, it appears that only the combined study of the results of experiments and simulations will deepen the understanding of the complicated interactions that occur in this soil biological ecosystem. It was the objective of this study to describe the respirometer system, the explanatory simulation model, and the tests that were done to evaluate the integral model and the separate submodels...|$|R

The <b>respirometer</b> is <b>used</b> to measure the dissolved oxygen concentration by monitoring the luminescence intensity of ruthenium dye immobilized in a polymer film {{in contact with the}} wastewater sample. The intensity is related to the extent of oxygen quenching of luminescence. The toxicity of chemicals can be evaluated by measuring the inhibition on respiration rate of microorganism <b>using</b> the scanning <b>respirometer.</b> The IC 50 values (concentration of a chemical that exhibits 50 % respiration inhibition) of various phenolic chemicals in activated sludge were determined.

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 In situ {{light and}} dark planktonic and benthal <b>respirometers</b> were <b>used</b> to measure the oxygen {{requirements}} of Yaquina estuary water and benthal deposits. Respirometer devices were constructed so that actual conditions of mixing could be simulated and benthal deposit disturbance would be minimized. A mathematical model <b>of</b> a benthal <b>respirometer</b> was developed and was used to make corrections for respirometer leakage and to conduct oxygen transfer parameter sensitivity studies. The effect of mixing on benthal oxygen uptake was studied by varying the simulated mixing velocities.

The device was unique because the electrode and instrumentation were provided by a clinical blood-gas analyzer. Oxygen uptake by blank controls was negligible, whereas cells and tissue consumed oxygen at rates of approximately 1 to 5 mul/h in a dose- and temperature-dependent fashion. Cyanide, heat, and freeze-thaw lysis reduced the oxygen uptake to less than 0. 6 mul/mg per h.

Several Anaerobic Toxicity tests {{have been developed to}} screen wastewater for toxicity and assess the treatability of such toxicants. However, past research and reviews on Biochemical Methane Potential (BMP) test and Anaerobic Toxicity Assay (ATA) were considered in this study. The experimental tests included ammonium-nitrogen and sodium chloride toxicity tests with varied concentration and solid retention time. These tests were designed to demonstrate the impact of ammonia- nitrogen and sodium chloride on the biological degradation process. The anaerobic test set-up includes bench-scale test reactors and <b>respirometers</b> <b>used</b> for measuring gas production volume and rate. The experimental data using the gas production volumes and rates were plotted and analyzed. The hourly rate of gas production significantly decreases before the daily production volume decreases. Also, the gas production volume curves showed little or no toxicity when the gas production rates showed toxicity and acclimation. In conclusion, the hourly production rate curves will indicate toxicity faster and extensively than the cumulative daily production volume curves, thereby reducing testing time...|$|R

30|$|This {{particular}} {{headspace gas}} respirometer {{is designed to}} measure the amount of oxygen consumed by the biomass {{under the assumption that}} the evolved carbon dioxide will be completely absorbed by the caustic scrubber placed in the scrubber tube within the reactor. Although these measurements usually over-simplify the actual situation as they do not consider the effect of liquid-phase pH and oxygen and carbon dioxide transfer limitations. However, there is an option of indirect estimation of carbon dioxide (approximately) generated in the biodegradation process. To perform this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> analysis, the apparatus needs to orient in a particular fashion where three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> wastewater samples with two replicas from each group are to be placed in the six CSBRs <b>of</b> the <b>respirometer.</b> One sample from each group is placed in a reactor having carbon dioxide scrubbing system while the other is placed in the second reactor without the scrubber.

40|$|Commonly used {{bioenergetics}} {{models of}} fish {{assume that the}} energy budget is additive, that is, each component of the budget has its own allocation and at least the basal level of this specific capacity cannot be used for other purposes. However, it has been proposed that rapidly growing fish larvae with a narrow metabolic scope may have to reduce the energy allocated to activity or maintenance {{in order to maintain}} high growth rates. This has been called previously compensatory budgeting. In the present study, we addressed this important issue by conducting swimming respirometer experiments and reanalysing previous feeding <b>respirometer</b> data <b>using</b> larval whitefish. In the swimming respirometer, the total metabolic rate of unfed larvae was lower than the total rate of fed larvae, in which the total rate increased with increasing ration. The swimming respirometer experiments suggested that the costs of digestion and activity have their own basal requirements and are at least to some extent independent. The reanalysis <b>of</b> the feeding <b>respirometer</b> data showed that up to a specific growth rate of about 16 % day- 1 no suppression of maintenance functions is needed to achieve high growth rates. These results together suggest that the energy budget of larval whitefish is indeed additive, and that this assumption is therefore justified as a theoretical base in modelling larval coregonid energetics...|$|R

40|$|Manufacturing {{industries}} synthesize new {{chemical products}} every day, which eventually {{find their way}} into domestic and industrial wastewaters. As a result, wastewater is becoming increasingly more complex in nature. The emerging pollutants escape the treatment systems and appear in the receiving water bodies. Wastewater treatment plants in India still report effluent parameters in terms of biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) at the ppm level, whereas these emerging pollutants, many of whom are non-biodegradable, can be toxic and carcinogenic at the ppb level. Therefore, it is imperative to look for alternatives or upgrade the existing systems which safely remove these harmful compounds from wastewater. In this research, efficiency of electrocoagulation process was assessed in a laboratory-scale setup in removing recalcitrant carbon from a real wastewater. The wastewater was collected from an effluent treatment plant that receives domestic wastewater and industrial effluents from chemical, bulk drugs and allied industries, for treatment. In this study, the wastewater sample was analyzed for total dissolved solids (TDS) and total organic carbon (TOC), and then treated biologically in a <b>respirometer</b> <b>using</b> aerobic microorganisms. After the oxygen uptake curve plateaued, indicating a cessation of biological process, the sample was analyzed for TDS and TOC and put in a lab-scale electrocoagulation setup. Iron and Aluminium electrodes were used in the study and efficiency of the system in removing the recalcitrant/residual carbon and TDS was studied with respect to the reaction time. The results showed that electrocoagulation can be a potential post-biological treatment system for removal of recalcitrant carbon from wastewaters...|$|R
