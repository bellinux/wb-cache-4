40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{application}} of Nd-YAG laser emitting at 355 nm to the drilling process of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polyetheretherkethone (PEEK-CF) laminates. The combination of a modern UV-laser source with a scanning technology enabling deflection speeds up to 2 m/s, suppresses heat affected zones (HAZ) and consequently detachment of fibers from the polymer matrix. The results show that minimum HAZ (about 50 μm) is achievable in machining of CFRP composite by using short pulsed UV laser. The study found that heat is easily accumulated in the material during laser processing, especially when the carbon fibres are chopped into small pieces. The paper discusses how {{to make use of}} the heat accumulation and how to avoid its potential damage to the workpiece by modulating the energy density input.

Indeed, this was their destination, as Barnaby could after a while see for himself, by the low point of land with a great, long row of cocoanut-palms growing upon it (the appearance of which he knew very well), which by-and-by began to loom up from the dimness of the moonlight. As they approached the river they found the tide was running very violently, so that it gurgled and rippled alongside the boat as the crew of black men pulled strongly against it.

I can only assure thee, courteous reader, for both our comforts, that my concern is altogether equal to thine, for my unhappiness in losing or mislaying among my papers the remaining part of these memoirs, which consisted of accidents, turns, and adventures, both new, agreeable, and surprising, and therefore calculated in all due points to the delicate taste of this our noble age. But alas! with my utmost endeavours I have been able only to retain a few of the heads.

60|$|The effect {{which this}} {{petition}} produced does not appear. Some temporary relief was perhaps obtained. But, soon after, this daring adventurer {{was engaged in}} a very dark intrigue against an exile of his own country, and placed pretty nearly in his own circumstances. A remarkable Highland story must be here briefly alluded to. Mr. Campbell of Glenure, who had been named factor for Government on the forfeited estates of Stewart of Ardshiel, was shot dead by an assassin as he passed through the wood of Lettermore, after crossing the ferry of Ballachulish. A gentleman, named James Stewart, a natural brother of Ardshiel, the forfeited person, was tried as being accessory to the murder, and condemned and executed upon very doubtful evidence; the heaviest part of which only amounted to the accused person having assisted a nephew of his own, called Allan Breck Stewart, with money to escape after the deed was done. Not satisfied with this vengeance, which was obtained in a manner little to the honour of the dispensation of justice at the time, {{the friends of the}} deceased Glenure were equally desirous to obtain possession of the person of Allan Breck Stewart, supposed to be the actual homicide. James Mhor Drummond was secretly applied to <b>to</b> <b>trepan</b> Stewart to the sea-coast, and bring him over to Britain, to almost certain death. Drummond MacGregor had kindred connections with the slain Glenure; and, besides, the MacGregors and Campbells had been friends of late, while the former clan and the Stewarts had, as we have seen, been recently at feud; lastly, Robert Oig was now in custody at Edinburgh, and James was desirous to do some service by which his brother might be saved. The joint force of these motives may, in James's estimation of right and wrong, have been some vindication for engaging in such an enterprise, although, as must be necessarily supposed, it could only be executed by treachery of a gross description. MacGregor stipulated for a license to return to England, promising to bring Allan Breck thither along with him. But the intended victim was put upon his guard by two countrymen, who suspected James's intentions towards him. He escaped from his kidnapper, after, as MacGregor alleged, robbing his portmanteau of some clothes and four snuff-boxes. Such a charge, it may be observed, could scarce have been made unless the parties had been living on a footing of intimacy, and had access to each other's baggage.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In laser {{materials}} processing, trepanning optics {{are used}} to fabricate laser drilled holes of high aspect ratios (> 10) and controllable drill-hole 1 conicity. However, trepanning optics available up to today are limited <b>to</b> circular <b>trepanning</b> geometries. Thus, only circular holes with drill-hole wall angles of rotational symmetry are feasible. Within this paper we will present a novel trepanning optic based on two piezo-actuatoric tip/tilt mirrors, being first of its kind, which allows arbitrary developments of propagation angle and lateral position of the laser beam, both being independent of each other. Consequently, the novel trepanning optic allows arbitrary drill-hole geometries such as circular, elliptical, rectangular etc. At {{the same time the}} drill-hole wall angle may be varied freely. Thus, asymmetric drill-hole wall angles are feasible such as tilt of the drill hole or wobbling of the drill-hole wall angle for instance. Demonstrative drill-holes of different shapes produced with an ultrashort pulsed laser prove the flexibility of the trepanning optic presented...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPhysically based models, {{resolved}} {{using the}} finite element (FE) method, {{are often used}} to model changes in geometry and the associated stress fields of graphite moderator bricks within a reactor.

Historically, behaviour on material properties have been obtained from Materials Test Reactor (MTR) experiments, however data relating <b>to</b> samples <b>trepanned</b> from operating reactors are increasingly being used to improve models. Geometry measurements from operating reactors offer the potential for improving the coded relationship for dimensional change in FE models. A non-linear mixed-effect model is presented for calibrating the parameters of FE models that are sensitive to mid-brick diameter, using channel geometry measurements obtained from inspection campaigns. The work makes use of a novel technique: {{the development of a}} Bayesian emulator, which is a surrogate for the FE model. The use of an emulator allows the influence of the inputs to the finite element model to be evaluated, and delivers a substantial reduction in the computational burden of calibration...|$|R

When meeting a fortune teller, Madame Blanche, he is informed that Detective Van Zwam will be in danger when he enters a castle named [...] "The Rat's Castle" [...] in Erps-Kwerps. Indeed, at that same time Van Zwam and his dog Tito are {{in the vicinity of}} said castle and hear that several people who once entered there never came back alive. A local farmer advises Van Zwam to ring the clock in the castle's bell tower in case of danger. The story then returns to Nero who enters the castle in fear that Van Zwam is in danger (unbeknownst to him Van Zwam didn't enter). Inside Nero encounters a huge rat, whom he manages to scare off, but is captured by the mad scientist Dr. Ratsjenko, who tries to murder him. Since Nero keeps dozing off he is an easy victim. Just when Ratsjenko wants to murder Nero the rat accidentally rings the bell tower clock, alarming everybody outside. Unfortunately for Nero the farmers don't come to his aid at all, but just run off. However, Zwam happens to hear the bell and enters the castle where he finds Nero. Ratsjenko has fled, but while Van Zwam and Nero try to find him they suddenly see a colossal rat of about two metres high. They panick and run away, while the reader discovers it was just Ratsjenko in a rat suit. Meanwhile, Nero and Van Zwam get back to their senses and re-enter the castle, destined to find Ratsjenko. They discover his secret hiding place, but are captured and tied up as Ratsjenko plans <b>to</b> <b>trepan</b> them for a brain transplant, where he wants to put human brains inside a rat's head. When Ratsjenko reaches for his chloroform he accidentally puts himself to sleep. At that precise moment Ratsjenko's rat happens to quarrel with his wife. She is opposed to Ratsjenko's plans, scares her husband off and gnaws Nero's ropes loose. As Nero prepares to untie Van Zwam he falls asleep again, while Ratsjenko awakes again. He prepares Nero for the operation and gives him some extra chloroform, which has the opposite effect on him. Now fully awake Nero knocks Ratsjenko unconsicous and frees Van Zwam, but the evil doctor manages to escape yet again, taking Van Zwam's dog Tito with him.|$|E

5000|$|Firstly, {{reference}} bushes {{are attached}} to the front and back surfaces of the component at the measurement location, to minimise [...] "bell-mouthing" [...] and assist with aligning the data sets during analysis. A reference hole is then drilled through a component; in engineering metals, a gun-drill is typically used due to the smooth and straight hole profile they produce. After drilling, the diameter of the reference hole is measured at frequent intervals along the full length and circumference of the measurement and reference bushes with an air probe. This is a thin rod with pressurised air forced from the end via two small holes at a normal to the reference hole axis. As the air probe is moved through the hole, changes in hole diameter will result in changes in pressure, which are detected with a calibrated transducer to convert the pressure change into a voltage. A cylinder (i.e. a core) of material containing the reference hole along its axis is then cut (trepanned) from the component using electro-discharge machining (EDM), in order to relax the stresses acting on the reference hole. Finally, the diameter of the reference hole is re-measured through the entire thickness of the cylinder and reference bushes, with the diameter measurements taken at the same locations as those measured prior <b>to</b> the <b>trepanning.</b>|$|R

The number of pulses to drill through steel and copper sheets with thicknesses up to 1 mm have been measured {{as a function of}} the repetition rate and the pulse energy. Two distinctive effects, influencing the drilling efficiency at high repetition rates, have been experimentally found and studied: particle shielding and heat accumulation. While the shielding of subsequent pulses due to the ejected particles leads to a reduced ablation efficiency, this effect is counteracted by heat accumulation. The experimental data are in good qualitative agreement with simulations of the heat accumulation effect and previous studies on the particle emission. However, for materials with a high thermal conductivity as copper, both effects are negligible for the investigated processing parameters. Therefore, the full power of the fiber CPA system can be exploited, which allows <b>to</b> <b>trepan</b> high-quality holes in 0. 5 mm-thick copper samples with breakthrough times as low as 75 ms...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Several {{research}} {{works have}} shown that Artificial Neural Networks — ANNs — have an appropriate inductive bias for several domains, since they can learn any input-output mapping, i. e., ANNs have the universal approximation property. Although symbolic learning algorithms have a less flexible inductive bias than ANNs, they are needed when a good understating of the decision process is essential, since symbolic ML algorithms express the knowledge induced using symbolic structures that can be interpreted and understood by humans. On the other hand, ANNs lack the capability of explaining their decisions, since the knowledge is encoded as real-valued weights and biases of the network. This encoding is difficult to be interpreted by humans. Aiming {{to take advantage of}} both approaches, this work proposes a method that extract symbolic knowledge, expressed as decision rules, from ANNs. The proposed method combines knowledge induced by several symbolic ML algorithms through the application of a Genetic Algorithm — GA. Our method is experimentally analyzed in a number of application domains. Results show that the method is able to extract symbolic knowledge having high fidelity with trained ANNs. The proposed method is also compared <b>to</b> <b>TREPAN,</b> another method for extracting knowledge from ANNs, showing promising results. ...|$|E

The most recent form of neuroanesthesia is the combination of carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and nitrogen.

Henry Yule noted that {{the name of the}} Byzantine negotiator [...] "Yenyo" [...] (the patrician John Pitzigaudes) was mentioned in Chinese sources, an envoy who was unnamed in Edward Gibbon's account of the man sent to Damascus to hold a parley with the Umayyads, followed a few years later by the increase of tributary demands on the Byzantines. The New Book of Tang and Wenxian Tongkao described the land of Nubia (either the Kingdom of Kush or Aksum) as a desert south-west of the Byzantine Empire that was infested with malaria, where the natives had black skin and consumed Persian dates. In discussing the three main religions of Nubia (the Sudan), the Wenxian Tongkao mentions the Daqin religion there and the day of rest occurring every seven days for those following the faith of the Da shi (the Muslim Arabs). It also repeats the claim in the New Book of Tang about the Eastern Roman surgical practice of <b>trepanning</b> <b>to</b> remove parasites from the brain. The descriptions of Nubia and Horn of Africa in the Wenxian Tongkao were ultimately derived from the Jingxingji of Du Huan (fl. 8th century AD), a Chinese travel writer whose text, preserved in the Tongdian of Du You, is perhaps the first Chinese source to describe Ethiopia (Laobosa), in addition to offering descriptions of Eritrea (Molin).|$|R
