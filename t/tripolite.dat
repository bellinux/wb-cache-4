40|$|The Mississippi Lime play is an {{important}} recent oil and gas development in the mid-continent of the United States. In April of 2007, Chesapeake Energy Corporation used horizontal drilling and tracing to bring the Howell 1 - 33 H well online. This well revitalized the Mississippi Lime play, expanding exploration with potential Mississippian reservoirs. The Mississippian section is a complex carbonate reservoir containing several distinct lithologies. An important Mississippian lithology known from outcrops in Arkansas and Missouri is tripolitic chert, or tripolite; a bleach, highly diagenetically altered, silica rock with high porosity, low density, and high permeability. <b>Tripolite</b> is {{an important}} reservoir target with the broader Mississippi dense lime play, but {{should not be confused}} with Mississippi Chat reservoirs found in Kansas or Oklahoma which commonly are described as cherty paleosols, chert breccia or conglomerates. Acoustic impedance of <b>tripolite</b> is quite low, leading to a characteristic strong negative amplitude anomaly in 3 D seismic data (i. e., a lithology bright spot). This study presents techniques and results for seismic mapping of probable <b>tripolite</b> occurrences in the Wild Creek 3 D seismic survey of Osage County, Oklahoma. Resolution estimates are also presented, along with preliminary reflection coefficient calculations indicating observed amplitude anomalies represent <b>tripolite</b> embedded in dense Mississippian limestone, a stratigraphic relationship in agreement with recent outcrop observations...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of GeologyMatthew W. TottenThe Spivey-Grabs-Basil {{oil field}} {{is a highly}} {{developed}} field in south-central Kansas, having large variability in its production and in the Pineville <b>Tripolite</b> facies. The Pineville <b>Tripolite</b> is the primary producing formation of this field having major isopach variations, possibly influencing production. The hypothesis that the field is highly compartmentalized is from the varied production, isopach {{and structure of the}} field. This study investigated the Pineville <b>Tripolite</b> facies in the Spivey-Grabs-Basil Oil Field, with the Basil area the predominant focus, and its possible compartmentalization by looking at the gas chromatograms and their biomarker signatures. This field has had several studies investigating the geophysical attributes, depositional setting and large-scale compartmentalization. Post depositional sea-level changes and possibly syntectonics exposed the Reeds Spring to a sub-aerial environment where meteoric alteration created immense porosity and the Pineville <b>Tripolite</b> facies. Geochemical data shows evidence that this section of the field is sourced from both a marine shale and carbonate source at peak oil maturity, deposited in an anoxic environment. Biodegradation appears very slight, with most alterations transpiring in the alkane ranges only, leaving all other susceptible hydrocarbons unaltered. Compartments within the field are harder to identify when comparing geological data to oil data. Isopach data shows altered thickness of the Pineville <b>Tripolite</b> from well to well, as do Pineville structure values. The isopach and structural data point to possible areas for compartments, but it is from oil geochemical data that compartments become more visible. API gravities and GOR show motley values, but do indicate two significant areas of segregation. The deepest, most southern end of the study showed lighter gravity oils than the middle, suggesting possible fill and spill between the two. However, biomarker abundance indicates three possible compartments. The southern compartment has many more biomarker volumes than do the middle compartment, both divided by a reservoir pinch-out. The third most northeastern well has high biomarker abundance, but shows no geological separators from the other wells. Production from this field may be improved by investigating the biomarkers to allocate these compartments and possible barriers close to wells...|$|E
40|$|The Boone Formation in {{northwest}} Arkansas and southwestern Missouri exposes a nearly complete sequence of Lower Mississippian chert-bearing carbonates deposited {{by a single}} 3 rd order transgression and regression. An abundant amount of chert that has replaced limestone highlights the Boone, but little is understood about the timing and development of chert in Lower Mississippian carbonates. Interpretation of the diagenetic history of the chert, in particular <b>tripolite,</b> has significant implications beyond the outcrop. Determining the origin, timing, and extent of tripolitic chert in the Lower Mississippian System improves reservoir characterization in subsurface petroleum reservoirs in the mid-continent that are laterally equivalent to the Boone Formation. The Boone exposures are used as analogs for subsurface carbonate intervals in the Mississippi Lime Play. Results from Petrographic, SEM, EDX, and carbonate weight percent analyses have determined the stratigraphic extent of tripolitization in the Lower Mississippian carbonate succession, as well the controls on <b>tripolite</b> formation. The interpretation that tripolitic chert {{occurs as a result}} of a leaching by groundwater and the presence of carbonate controls the development of tripolitic chert can be used to locate highly porous tripolitic chert in analogous carbonate reservoirs in the midcontinent...|$|E
40|$|Ground-based hyperspectral imaging {{is fairly}} new for {{studying}} near-vertical rock exposures where airborne or satellite-based imaging fail to provide useful information. In this study, ground-based hyperspectral image {{analysis was performed}} on a roadcut, where diagenetic <b>tripolite</b> facies is observed in southwestern Missouri. Laboratory-based reflectance spectroscopy and hyperspectral image analyses were also performed on collected samples. Image classification was performed using Spectral Feature Fitting (SFF) and Mixture-tuned Match Filtering (MTMF) with laboratory- and image-derived end-member spectra. SFF provided thorough yet detailed classification, whereas MTMF provided information on the relative abundances of the lithologies. Ground-based hyperspectral imaging demonstrated its potential to aid geological studies providing valuable information on mineralogical and lithological variations rapidly and with two-dimensional continuity in inaccessible rock faces of near-vertical outcrops. The results showed decreasing <b>tripolite</b> abundance going downward in the investigated vertical succession. Also, a leaching pattern has been observed such that persistent and continuous limestone layers become lenses and patches towards the upper portion of the outcrop. These observations show {{that the effect of}} tripolitization decreases when going deeper in the succession, suggesting that the fluid responsible for the weathering of siliceous precursors may have been flowing from top to bottom and thus have had a meteoric origin...|$|E
