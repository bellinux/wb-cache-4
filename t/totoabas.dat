50|$|Commercial {{fishing for}} <b>totoaba</b> {{began in the}} 1920s. The catch reached 2,000 metric tons in 1943, but had fallen to only 50 tons in 1975, when Mexico {{protected}} the <b>totoaba</b> and banned the fishery. Anecdotal evidence suggests that <b>totoaba</b> were very abundant {{prior to the start}} of the commercial fishery, but there is no hard evidence of natural population size. Recent studies indicate that the <b>totoaba</b> population has stabilized at a low level, perhaps a bit bigger than when the commercial fishery was banned in 1975. <b>Totoaba</b> are still caught, as by-catch in fishing for other finned fish and for shrimp, and in illegal fishing for <b>totoaba</b> directly. Some <b>totoaba</b> are illegally exported to the United States, often misidentified as white seabass. The government of Baja California has authorized commercial raising of <b>totoaba</b> in fish farms.|$|R
50|$|The <b>totoaba</b> or totuava (<b>Totoaba</b> macdonaldi) is {{a marine}} fish, the largest {{member of the}} drum family Sciaenidae, that is endemic to the Gulf of California in Mexico.

North American Association of Fisheries Economists (NAAFE), Corvallis, 2017. Management objectives of vulnerable fish species {{must focus on}} maintaining healthy population status. Hence, reference points should be constrained to ensure recruitment. We assessed bioeconomic reference points for the <b>totoaba</b> (<b>Totoaba</b> macdonaldi), an endemic fish to the Gulf of California, reaching lengths of 2 m and 25 years. <b>Totoaba</b> fishing is banned since 1975, after a drastic decline of catches in the upper Gulf of California. Although <b>totoaba</b> is protected by several international organizations, the demand by the Asian black market for the <b>totoaba</b> swim bladder has intensified illegal fishing {{in the past few}} years. <b>Totoaba</b> reference points were estimated as the steady state solution of a dynamic optimal management problem, taking into account: (1) fishing hook and gillnet technology with different selectivity shapes, (2) a discount factor associated with the reference points to discount future economic profits, and (3) effort levels (f) are subject to maintaining optimal spawning-stock biomass (SSB). With the introduction of economic behavior in the model, we analyzed f, yields (Y), and SSB trajectories under four scenarios, where the initial f begins at different years when <b>totoaba</b> fishery regulation decision is taken (from 2013 through 2016). Each scenario was modeled under three <b>totoaba</b> population states: recovered, mid-recovery, and depleted. Gillnet reached higher Y at lower f; however, this gear is not recommended because it is highly predatory for other protected species. Different scenario modelling showed that regulation delay has a negative impact on net present value...|$|R
50|$|The <b>totoaba</b> {{can grow}} up to two metres in length and 100 kg in weight. Their diet {{consists}} of finned fish and crustaceans.

50|$|The vanity {{price of}} a {{vanishing}} kind of maw is behind the imminent extinction of the vaquita, the world's smallest dolphin breed. Only found in Mexico's Gulf of California, the once numerous vaquita now number less than 60 in total. Vaquita die in gillnets set to catch <b>totoaba</b> (the world's largest drum fish). <b>Totoaba</b> are being hunted to extinction for its maw, which can sell for as much $10,000 per kilogram.|$|R
50|$|Vaquitas {{have never}} been hunted directly, but their {{population}} is declining, largely because of animals becoming trapped in illegal gillnets intended for capturing the <b>totoaba,</b> a large critically endangered fish of the drum family endemic to the Gulf. A trade in <b>totoaba</b> swim bladders has arisen, driven by demand from China (where they are used in soup, being considered a delicacy and also erroneously thought to have medicinal value), which is greatly exacerbating the problem.|$|R
50|$|Accidental {{drowning}} in gillnets set by fishermen meant for catching <b>totoaba</b> {{is the primary}} cause of anthropogenic, incidental mortality for the vaquita. Three fishing villages in the northern Gulf of California are primarily involved in the <b>totoaba</b> fishery and, as a result, most directly involved in threats to the vaquita. San Felipe, in Baja California, and Golfo de Santa Clara and Puerto Peñasco, in Sonora, have a total population of approximately 61,000. Up to 80% of the economy in these towns is associated with the fishing industry. A total of 1771 vessels make up the artisanal fleet that have permits to fish with nets, with the total size of the commercial fishery unknown due to the extent of the black market for <b>totoaba.</b> Around 3,000 individuals are involved in the <b>totoaba</b> industry overall. The total economic impact of the industry for the region is estimated to be approximately $5.4 million USD annually, or $78.5 million Pesos. Socioeconomic surveys of the northern Gulf have suggested that approximately $25 million, if invested in the region through education, equipment buyout, and job placement, could end the vaquita bycatch problem.|$|R
40|$|Socio-political {{issues are}} {{important}} in environmental policy outcomes but are often overlooked in conservation planning. We analyze the effects of historical social, political, and ecological contexts on conservation policy outcomes as applied to the Upper Gulf of California and Colorado River Delta Biosphere Reserve. A rushed implementation, perhaps necessary {{for the protection of}} endangered <b>totoaba</b> (<b>Totoaba</b> macdonaldi) and vaquita (Phocoena sinus), occurred with little community consultation, resulting in enduring disgruntlement among stakeholders that undermined its effectiveness. Overfishing and habitat degradation continue {{both inside and outside the}} reserve, and <b>totoaba</b> and vaquita remain Critically Endangered, with the latter's population estimated at approximately 90 individuals. Marine reserves can be useful, but when top-down enforcement is unfeasible, effective environmental policy requires full recognition and integration of political history and social structures and needs, and open discussion on trade-offs when win-win situations are not possible...|$|R
50|$|The <b>totoaba</b> {{population}} {{is found in}} two distinct groups. Larval and juvenile stages occupy the Colorado delta, while the adult breeding population lives {{for most of the}} year in deeper water towards the middle of the Sea of Cortez. The adult population migrates to the Colorado delta in April and May to spawn. One-year-old <b>totoaba</b> are metabolically most efficient in brackish water of about 20 ppt (parts per thousand) salinity, a level that occurred naturally in the delta before the diversion of water from the river that occurred {{in the middle of the}} 20th century.|$|R
5000|$|In 2014, {{estimates}} of the species' abundance dropped below 100 individuals. An international vaquita recovery team concluded that the population is decreasing {{at a rate of}} 18.5% per year, and [...] "the species will soon be extinct unless drastic steps are taken immediately." [...] Their report recommended that a ban on gillnet fishing be enforced throughout the range of the vaquita, that action be taken to eliminate the illegal fishery for the <b>totoaba,</b> and that with help from the U.S. and China, trade in <b>totoaba</b> swim bladders be halted.|$|R

A main reason has been a lack of explicit consideration of the economic dynamics and behavior of artisanal fishers. We develop a bioeconomic model that represents a series of past conservation and fisheries management policies, analyzing their empirical results from a simple economic theoretical framework. Results show how counteracting policies, and basic changes to fishing behavior, negate potential benefits to various objectives.

40|$|Different {{institutions}} and agencies have provided funding {{during the development}} and implementation of the acoustic monitoring program. The vaquita (Phocoena sinus) is the world's most endangered marine mammal with ≈ 245 individuals remaining in 2008. This species of porpoise is endemic to the northern Gulf of California, Mexico, and has historically suffered population declines from unsustainable bycatch in gillnets. An illegal gillnet fishery for an endangered fish, the <b>totoaba</b> (<b>Totoaba</b> macdonaldi), has recently resurged throughout the vaquita's range. The secretive but lucrative wildlife trade with China for <b>totoaba</b> swim bladders has probably increased vaquita bycatch mortality, but by an unknown amount. Precise population monitoring by visual surveys is difficult because vaquitas are inherently hard to see and have now become so rare that sighting rates are very low. However, their echolocation clicks can be identified readily on specialized acoustic detectors. Acoustic detections on an array of 46 moored detectors indicate that vaquita acoustic activity declined by 80 % between 2011 and 2015 in the central part of the species’ range. Statistical models estimate an annual rate of decline of 34 % (95 % Bayesian Credible Interval - 48 % to - 21 %). Based on preliminary acoustic monitoring results from 2011 – 2014 the Government of Mexico enacted and is enforcing an emergency 2 -year ban of gillnets throughout the species’ range to prevent extinction, at a cost of $ 74 million USD to compensate fishers. Developing precise acoustic monitoring methods proved critical to exposing the severity of vaquitas’ decline and emphasizes the need for continual monitoring to effectively manage critically endangered species.

The number of Mexico’s endemic porpoise, the vaquita (Phocoena sinus), is {{collapsing}} {{primarily due to}} bycatch in illegal gillnets set for <b>totoaba</b> (<b>Totoaba</b> macdonaldi), an endangered fish whose swim bladders are exported to China. Previous research estimated that vaquitas declined from about 567 to 245 individuals between 1997 and 2008. Acoustic monitoring between 2011 and 2015 showed a decline of 34 %/year. Here, we combine visual line transect and passive acoustic data collected simultaneously in a robust spatial analysis to estimate that only 59 (95 % Bayesian Credible Interval [CRI] 22 – 145) vaquita remained as of autumn 2015, a decrease since 1997 of 92 % (95 % CRI 80 %- 97 %). Risk analysis suggests that if the current, temporary gillnet ban is maintained and effectively enforced, vaquitas could recover to 2008 population levels by 2050.

50|$|In early May 2016, the IUCN SSC - Cetacean Specialist Group {{reported}} that the vaquita population had dipped to around 60 remaining individuals in 2015.

40|$|I use {{microchemistry}} in fish otoliths to {{test the}} hypothesis that diverting Colorado River flow from reaching the Gulf of California has impacted two endemic fish: the threatened gulf Corvina, (Cynoscion othonopterus) and the endangered <b>totoaba</b> (<b>Totoaba</b> macdonaldi). The oxygen and carbon stable isotope ratios in otoliths help to reconstruct conditions of the environment during key life history stages before and after the damming and diverting the Colorado River. The δ¹⁸O in otoliths illustrate that both C. othonopterus and T. macdonaldi seek out brackish habitat provided by the Colorado River during their early life history. The δ¹⁸O of C. othonopterus otolith have a strong negative correlation with Colorado River flow. I found that previously published relationships between otolith δ¹⁸O and ambient temperature along with δ¹⁸O of the water are sufficient to predict ranges of expected δ¹⁸O values for T. macdonaldi in the field. The δ¹⁸O in pre-dam T. macdonaldi otoliths show significant divergence from modern T. macdonaldi otoliths’ values, indicating that these fish used the brackish waters of the Colorado River estuary. The δ¹³C in T. macdonaldi otoliths has a significant proportion of its δ¹³C derived from diet. Pre-dam T. macdonaldi juveniles have a significantly different diet, which reflects that the Colorado River estuary had higher productivity before diversion of the river. Lastly, T. macdonaldi grew faster before the dams and in association with Colorado River flow measured by the δ¹⁸O...|$|R
40|$|<b>Totoaba</b> macdonaldi is {{the largest}} sciaenid fish. It is endemic to the Gulf of California within a {{protected}} area and listed as threatened by the IUCN red list. The history of the <b>totoaba</b> fishery begun around 1920 and formally finished in 1975, when an official ban was established {{as a result of}} the collapse of the fishery. Several previous studies had mentioned the decrease in Colorado River flow and overfishing as possible reasons of the catch and stock reduction. This paper extends the exploration of the causes of the collapse analyzing the co-variation of the trends in catch, biomass, abundance, and fishing mortality with the Colorado River flow, diverse climatic indexes as well as the reconstructed fishing effort. Our results confirm the important role of the Colorado River flow cessation on the decrement of the catch, and the simultaneous increase of the fishing effort during 1940 - 1954. A new and stronger correlation was unveiled between catch, abundance and stock biomass with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation Index (PDOI). This fact points out the influence of large temporal and spatial scale processes and stresses the importance of the interaction of anthropogenic and natural factors when exploring the historical causes of a population decline and in planning stock recovery actions.

50|$|The {{population}} decrease is largely attributed to bycatch from the illegal gillnet fishery for the <b>totoaba,</b> a similarly sized endemic drum {{that is also}} critically endangered.

A partial gillnet ban was put in place for two years in May 2015; its scheduled expiration at the end of May 2017 spurred a campaign to have it extended and strengthened. On 7 June 2017, an agreement was announced by Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto to make the gillnet ban permanent and strengthen enforcement.
