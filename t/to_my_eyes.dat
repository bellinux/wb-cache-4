500|$|In Alastair Sooke's 2013 BBC Four {{documentary}} {{that took}} place in front of Whaam! at the Tate Modern, British comic book artist Dave Gibbons disputed Sooke's assertion that Lichtenstein's painting improved upon Novick's panel, saying: [...] "This to me looks flat and abstracted, to the point of view that <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> it's confusing. Whereas the original has got a three-dimensional quality to it, it's got a spontaneity to it, it's got an excitement to it, and a way of involving the viewer that this one lacks." [...] Gibbons has parodied Lichtenstein's derivation of the Novick work.|$|E
500|$|Thomas Sotinel of Le Monde {{started his}} review by recalling the {{irritation}} the film caused upon its world premiere in Cannes, and compared the cut {{he had seen}} there to the final version: [...] "In all honesty, the difference does not jump <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> Of course, the film seems more consistent, {{but that may be}} because we've already traveled this maze once. While leaving, we might remain calmer, but still amazed by the mixture of exuberant invention and puerility." [...] A positive review came from L'Express, written by Laurent Djian, who compared the film to 2001: A Space Odyssey. He applauded how he found the strobe lights hypnotising in a way that influenced the perception of time. [...] "In 2010, no other filmmaker [...] than Gaspar Noé can shoot with such mastery, nor draw us into a vortex of sensations as vertiginous." [...] Ouest-Frances critic, on the other hand, was immensely bored by the film, and called it [...] "a padding of simple ideas, stereotypes and cliches in a heap of contrived and vain images which think they're technical prowess. Soporific cinema." ...|$|E
500|$|Macartney {{was a short}} man, {{standing}} 160cm (5" [...] 3). When batting, {{he would}} unconventionally attempt to leg glance yorkers pitched on middle stump down to fine-leg, and often lost his wicket in so doing. He was known for preferring his team-mates to give him candid criticism rather than praise. In later life he condemned modern batsmen; he would explain why he no longer watched cricket by saying [...] "I can't bear watching luscious half-volleys being nudged gently back to bowlers". Sir Neville Cardus wrote that [...] "there was always chivalry in his cricket, a prancing sort of heroism. The dauntlessness of his play, the brave beauty and the original skill bring tears <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> yet." [...] In the late 1940s, Macartney {{received a letter from}} a compiler of Who's Who in Australia, seeking information on his life. Macartney said that he had [...] "no record of figures, nor am I concerned with them. My only interest is {{the manner in which the}} runs are compiled and how wickets are taken, and in the good of the game." [...] "Those sentiments", wrote former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton, [...] "summed up the cricket story of C. G. Macartney".|$|E

500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, {{columnist}} Noel Murray graded {{the episode}} with an A-, and praised September's stumbling {{entrance into the}} lab as [...] "yet another rich and remarkable scene". Entertainment Weekly writer Jeff Jensen had a more negative opinion, and commented that the episode [...] "failed to make my dinger hum," [...] which he attributed to high expectations set by fellow staff writer and former Fringe reviewer Ken Tucker. Jensen continued, [...] "It was, <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> 'just okay.' Certainly not the equal {{of the past two}} episodes. And not the strongest possible kicker to a strong second act for Fringes fourth season, which now takes a four-week snooze before rising anew on March 23 for the first of eight consecutive episodes– a sweep of story that might represent the very end of all things Fringe. Damn, I’m such a downer this week, aren’t I? Ah, but so was this episode." [...] In January 2013, IGN ranked the episode as the fourth best episode of the series, explaining that [...] "when Season 4 needed a boost of excitement, this episode delivered it in a timely fashion. It had a thrilling pace and offered answers to some questions that have lingering since the series began." ...|$|E
500|$|Frank Proffitt, the Appalachian {{musician}} whose {{version of}} [...] "Tom Dooley" [...] the Trio rearranged, watched their {{performance of his}} song on a television show and wrote in reaction, [...] "They clowned and hipswung. Then they came out with 'This time tomorrow, reckon where I’ll be/If it hadn't a' been for Grayson/I'd a been in Tennessee.' I began to feel sorty sick. Like I’d lost a loved one. Tears came <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> I went out and bawled on the ridge." [...] Proffitt had learned the song from {{his father and his}} grandmother, who had known Tom Dula and Laura Foster, the killer and the victim in the actual 1866 murder related in the song. Both Proffitt and fellow North Carolina musician Doc Watson sang the older version of the tune, which had [...] "a lively mocking tempo... that retained some of the ghastliness and moral squalor of an actual murder," [...] according to folk historian Robert Cantwell, who also notes that the Kingston Trio's version of the song left out several verses from the traditional lyric. The slower, harmonized Trio version of the Dooley song and other traditional numbers struck Proffitt as a betrayal of [...] "the strange mysterious workings which has made Tom Dooly [...] live..." [...] As recently as 2006, folk traditionalist and influential banjo master Billy Faier remarked: [...] "I hear and see very little respect for the folk genre" [...] in their music and described the Trio's repertoire as [...] "a mishmash of twisted arrangements that not only obscure the true beauty of the folk songs from which they derive, but give them a meaning they never had." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{concluding}} musical number, [...] "Rumour Has It" [...] / [...] "Someone Like You", was acclaimed as {{its main}} highlight. Raymund Flandez described Rivera's vocals as [...] "electrifying" [...] and [...] "golden". Futterman {{wrote that the}} performance was one of Glee best sequences: [...] "Mercedes and Santana nail their vocals and the song combines great tracks {{from one of the}} year's biggest albums while capturing both the sass and sadness of the Troubletones at this particular moment." [...] Votta called it the best performance since the cast's rendition of [...] "Don't Stop Believin' in the season one finale, [...] "Journey to Regionals", and stated, [...] "Naya Rivera's powerful vocals and the strong arrangement still packs the emotional punch Glee was targeting." [...] Chaney awarded the sequence a [...] "A+" [...] grade: [...] "Given the emotional stakes raised by Santana's outing, which happened in the scene right before this performance, {{and the fact that it}} marked the series's 300th musical performance, this marriage" [...] of the two Adele songs, [...] "Rumour Has It" [...] and [...] "Someone Like You", was [...] "all the more powerful". Moyler asserted that the number was [...] "perfection" [...] and said, [...] "This is why I watch Glee. It is just brilliant from Mercedes first belting to the snaps on the beat to the choreography with the girls walking in a circle and making little whispers to Santana bringing tears <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> singing 'Someone Like You' as if it was the last song she'll ever sing in her damn life." [...] Cinema Blend's Melissa Duko stated that the show [...] "hit it out of the park" [...] and added that it was her favorite performance of the season. Slezak gave the number an [...] "A+" [...] and wrote, [...] "Nobody can completely match Adele doing Adele, and yet Naya Rivera and Amber Riley somehow made the sum of this mashup a worthy equal to Adele's glorious original parts." [...] In December 2012, TV Guide named the mash-up one of Glee best performances.|$|E

Moore's [...] "solution was breathtaking and cocky – he created a long and distinguished history for these new characters, retro-fitting a fake silver and gold age for them." [...] Moore began writing comics for many of these characters, such as Glory and Youngblood, as well as a three-part mini-series known as Judgment Day to provide a basis for the Awesome Universe. Moore was not satisfied with Liefeld, saying [...] "I just got fed up with the unreliability of information that I get from him, that I didn't trust him. I didn't think that he was respecting the work and I found it hard to respect him. And also by then I was probably feeling that with the exception of Jim Lee, Jim Valentino – people like that – that a couple of the Image partners were seeming, <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> to be less than gentlemen.

2500|$|On 8 March 1932, Puyi {{made his}} {{ceremonial}} entry into Changchun, sharing his car with Zheng who was beaming with joy, Amakasu whose expression was stern as usual, and Wanrong, who looked miserable. Puyi remembered about {{his first time}} in Changchun: [...] "I saw Japanese gendarmes, and rows of people, wearing all sots of clothes; some were in Chinese jackets and gowns, some were in Western suits and some in traditional Japanese dress, {{and they were all}} holding small flags in their hands. I was thrilled and reflected that I was now seeing the scene that I missed at the harbor. As I walked past them Hsi Hsia [...] pointed out a line of dragon flags between the Japanese ones and said that the men holding them were all Manchu [...] "bannermen" [...] who had been waiting for me to come for twenty years. These words brought tears <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> and I was more strongly convinced than ever that my future was very hopeful". Puyi also noted he was [...] "too preoccupied with my hopes and hates" [...] to realize the [...] "cold comfort that the Changchun citizens, silent from terror and hatred, were giving me". Puyi's friend, the British journalist Woodhead, who covered his arrival in Manchuria, wrote [...] "outside official circles, I met no Chinese who felt any enthusiasm for the new regime", and that the city of Harbin was being terrorized by Chinese and Russian gangsters working for the Japanese, making Harbin [...] "lawless... even its main street unsafe after dark". In an interview with Woodhead, Puyi stated he planned to govern Manchukuo “in the Confucian spirit” and he was “perfectly happy” with his new position. An Italian journalist from the Corriere della Sera newspaper wrote: “I was unable to interview this pale, tired prince who doesn’t’ like to talk, who is always plunged in his meditations and who maybe regrets his life as a simple, studious citizen. He has a fixed stare behind his black-framed glasses. When we were introduced, he responded with a friendly nod. But his smile lasted only a second. We could only await the word of the Master of Ceremonies to give us permission to bow ourselves out.
