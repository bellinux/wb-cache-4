5|$|Via a live news report, a {{high-speed}} car chase {{comes to an}} end in the Nevada desert. Assuming it to be a kidnapping, police pull the female passenger from the car and place her into the protective custody of a police vehicle. The driver, Patrick Crump (Bryan Cranston), is pushed to the asphalt and handcuffed. The woman in <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>car</b> begins violently banging her head against the car window. As the news chopper catches all of this on film, the woman's head explodes, sending a spray of blood across the window.|$|E
5|$|During {{the bridge}} sequence, Minogue and Fletcher park {{in front of}} a shop, and Minogue seductively tries to {{distract}} the cashier outside by staring and posing at him, while Fletcher tries to steal money from the till. In the last scenes, Minogue is in another outfit trying to walk out of an alley with a bag of money, but sees a police car driving towards her and tries to walk off. Fletcher is caught by police and is escorted into <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>car</b> while yelling at Minogue. Minogue, who see the alteration, drives off with the money and looks back at Fletcher while driving down the street.|$|E
5|$|The {{sequence}} at Miami International Airport {{was partly}} {{shot at the}} Dunsfold Aerodrome, in Surrey, which is known from British car show Top Gear, with some footage from the Prague and Miami airports. In filming the scene in which the engine thrust of the moving aircraft blows <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>car</b> high into the air, second unit directors Ian Lowe, Terry Madden and Alex Witt used a crane with a strong lead cable attached to the rear bumper of the vehicle to move it up and backwards {{at the moment of}} full extension away from the plane.|$|E

50|$|Each maze is {{littered}} with dollar bills which the player collects by running over them. There are also several (usually four, but the first maze configuration has five) golden dollar signs placed throughout the mazes (the equivalent of Pac-Man's energizers); hitting one of these causes <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>cars</b> to temporarily turn red. While <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>cars</b> are red <b>the</b> player can crash into them and score extra points (100 for the first, 500 for the second, 1000 for the third, and 2000 for the fourth); if contact with <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>cars</b> occurs {{at any other time}} the player loses a life. When all the dollar bills on one screen have been collected, the player advances to the next level.|$|R

5|$|In {{the next}} scene, Gaga and her eye-patch wearing boyfriend are reading {{magazines}} {{on a sofa}} in a tea room. Gaga wears a yellow jumpsuit with circular glasses and shoulder pads. The Guardian compared this look with that of Minnie Mouse. She finally takes her revenge on her boyfriend by discreetly poisoning his drink with white powder concealed in her ring. As he falls dead, Gaga calls 9-1-1 and declares that she just killed her boyfriend. The police arrive at the mansion and arrest Gaga who, wearing a tall ice cream cone corkscrew wig, walks to <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>car</b> as the paparazzi surround her once again. Images flash by, with newspapers proclaiming her innocence and that Gaga {{is back in the}} spotlight and has regained her fame. The video ends with Gaga posing for mug shots like a fashion model while wearing a tulip shaped metallic dress similar to the single cover.|$|E
5|$|As Styles was {{examining}} the ricochet marks, Alison Cahn {{was approached by}} an elderly woman, who led Cahn to a nearby apartment building. There, the woman introduced Cahn to her daughter—Carmen Proetta—who told Cahn that she had witnessed the shooting at the petrol station; although initially reluctant, she was persuaded by Cahn to give her account of the events in an affidavit. Proetta asserted that, immediately before McCann and Farrell were shot, she saw a police car travelling north on Winston Churchill Avenue with its siren activated; as she watched, <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>car</b> stopped abruptly and four men—one uniformed police officer and three men in civilian clothes—jumped out. She stated that the three men in plain clothes, all carrying pistols, leapt across the central reservation barrier, at which point she saw McCann and Farrell raise their hands. Proetta believed that all three men then opened fire, while McCann and Farrell had their hands in the air, and that neither suspect made any movements towards their clothing or Farrell's handbag. She went on to state that she witnessed {{one of the men}} crouch over McCann and Farrell while they were on the ground, and continue to shoot them. According to Styles, Proetta's account of the shooting tallied with the bullet marks he examined at the petrol station; he also found her description of the bullets striking the bodies particularly convincing, believing that only somebody who had witnessed such an event would be able to describe it so vividly. The journalists also discovered that Proetta's account of the soldiers arriving in a police car matched some of the newspaper reports from the day after the shootings.|$|E
25|$|Witnesses {{who were}} {{outside of the}} Key West Bar said Morris was {{incapable}} of standing on her own, {{and had to be}} helped into <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>car.</b> They doubted that she would have been capable, just minutes later, of getting out of <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>car</b> on her own and walking away as police officers reported.|$|E

5000|$|Night Avenger is {{a parody}} of Batman and is filmed in the present-day Chicago, IL but {{takes place in the}} fictional city of [...] "Darkdom", much like Gotham City from Batman. Directed by Howard Rightman. During the scenes, <b>the</b> Darkdom <b>Police</b> <b>Cars,</b> shown often in the film, are lettered: Police-GPD, Gotham Police Department, instead of Police-DPD, Darkdom Police Department. This is an obvious take from <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>cars</b> in Batman Begins. The plot: Night Avenger has to protect Darkdom from Big Top.|$|R

25|$|Details {{supplied}} by police about the moments {{prior to and}} following Morris' injury and discovery by a passing motorist conflicted with family members' recollections of Morris, and with witnesses' accounts prior to Morris entering <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>car</b> outside of the Key West Bar.|$|E
25|$|The cover's dark {{atmosphere}} and Vico C holding up an anti-pollution mask might represent the society's contamination with crime (blood on the street, <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>car</b> behind Vico and a barricade tape), poverty (the homeless {{man and the}} buildings deterioration) and prostitution (the strip club at the background).|$|E
25|$|Automatic {{number plate}} {{recognition}} (ANPR): This computerised system uses cameras {{to observe the}} number plates of all vehicles passing or being passed by <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>car,</b> and alerts the driver or user to any cars which are on a 'watch list' as being stolen, used in crime, or having not paid vehicle duty.|$|E
60|$|A {{deafening}} hail of fire burst loose. Small robot guns appeared everywhere, needle barrels {{emerging from}} behind hidden screens, trees and shrubs, rocks, stones. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>cars</b> {{were caught in}} a withering cross-fire, trapped {{at the base of}} the hills.|$|R
5000|$|In the 2006 South Park episode A Million Little Fibers, {{an officer}} of <b>the</b> Chicago <b>Police</b> was gunned down by Oprah Winfrey's vagina.

5000|$|The Muscle Cars car disk {{included}} five muscle {{cars from}} the 60's, a 1963 Corvette Stingray, 1969 Camaro ZL-1 COPO, 1968 Mustang Shelby GT500, 1967 Pontiac GTO and a 1969 Dodge Charger Daytona. The expansion didn't change <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>cars</b> as well, though, so the player had practically {{no chance of}} outrunning a <b>police</b> <b>car</b> when caught speeding.|$|R
25|$|The {{installation}} of this equipment {{in a car}} partially transforms it into a desk. Police officers use their car to fill out different forms, print documents, type on a computer or a console, consult and read different screens, etc. Ergonomics in layout and {{installation of}} these items in <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>car</b> {{plays an important role}} in the comfort and safety of the police officers at work and preventing injuries such as back pain and musculoskeletal disorders.|$|E
25|$|A {{few hours}} after Paglin's departure, an {{incident}} took place that could {{have led to the}} discovery of the hostages: the two lookouts at the plant noticed a police car patrolling the area. Fearing it was heading towards the plant, they hid themselves. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>car</b> was on routine patrol and went on its way, but the guard in the nearby plant noticed them slipping through the window, assumed they were burglars, and called the police.|$|E
25|$|James and Sirius are {{the heroes}} of the Harry Potter prequel, an 800-word story set three years before Harry's birth.

The policemen attempt to arrest them when three Death Eaters on broomsticks fly down towards them. James and Sirius use <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>car</b> as a barrier and the Death Eaters crash into it. In the end, they escape from the policemen by flying away on the motorbike.|$|E
50|$|It {{was filmed}} during November 1979, using only 24 cast and crew. Its {{overheads}} were surprisingly minimal, {{to the point}} that <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>cars</b> used doubled as crew and towing vehicles, and that the director Geoff Murphy performed some of the stunts himself.|$|R

25|$|Police {{vehicles}} are often fitted with audible and visual warning systems to alert other motorists of their approach or {{position on the}} road. In many countries, use of the audible and visual warnings affords the officer a degree of exemption from road traffic laws (such {{as the right to}} exceed speed limits, or to treat red stop lights as a yield sign) and may also suggest a duty on other motorists {{to move out of the}} direction of passage of <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>car</b> or face possible prosecution.|$|E
25|$|The game {{opens with}} Lee Everett {{on his way}} to prison after his {{conviction}} in Atlanta, Georgia.

The officer is killed by walkers, and Lee takes shelter in a nearby home, discovering a little girl named Clementine. Her parents went away for a few days to Savannah, when the zombie apocalypse began, though through answering machine messages, it is revealed they were involved in an attack. Lee offers to protect and care for Clementine, and help her find them.|$|E
25|$|Chief Justice Roberts {{feared the}} Court's ruling {{would limit the}} ability of police to combat {{domestic}} violence. Chief Justice Roberts {{also noted that the}} purpose of the Fourth Amendment was to protect individual privacy, but any person who shares a dwelling (or, as Chief Justice Roberts points out, a locker or a hard drive) with another person may anticipate that the other person sharing access to their belongings might turn them over to authorities. In short, to share a home with someone is to surrender privacy as to that person, who might then consent to an invasion of it. Roberts also asserted that the majority opinion was arbitrary, as previous case law had held an objecting resident who was being held in <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>car,</b> as opposed to in the house, could be ignored with respect to the search.|$|E

25|$|After an {{interlude}} by Mr. Hudson, furious {{about the}} need to re-shoot the first scene, the scene continues from where it left off. The rally car speeds up continuing the donuts that ended the first scene before speeding to the far left corner of the arena where a <b>police</b> <b>car</b> suddenly appears. <b>The</b> rally car brakes with just centimetres to spare. It then reverses half the width of the arena before performing a reverse-180 turn and driving towards <b>the</b> second <b>police</b> <b>car</b> at <b>the</b> far right of the arena. The rally car then speeds up to the left end of the arena with <b>the</b> second <b>police</b> <b>car</b> following it. At this point the rally car drifts the corner before returning to the right side performing a 180 skid to park the car perpendicular with the right wall. <b>The</b> two <b>police</b> <b>cars</b> follow performing <b>the</b> same manoeuvre resulting in the three cars being in parallel with each other. The rally car first races off the arena through the centre exit. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>cars</b> then meet in the middle and perform donuts, with the nose of each car nearly touching the next, before following the exit of the rally car. At this point the motorcyclist makes his return by shooting a third <b>police</b> <b>car</b> with his gun, which causes it to split in half.|$|R
