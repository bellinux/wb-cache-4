25|$|Jonathon Porritt's {{call for}} the Green Party to select a single leader is flawed. Rather than {{suggesting}} the Green Party becomes a little more like the conventional top down political parties, Jonathon could show a little more personal leadership.

I am calling on Jonathon to use video conferencing a little more and to fly a little less.|$|E

Sporting a scrawny beard and wearing an old Red Army uniform, he {{returned}} to Corso Re Umberto. The next few months gave him an opportunity to recover physically, re-establish contact with surviving friends and family, and start looking for work.

500|$|The Nationalist {{government}} portrayed Biko as a hater of whites, but he {{had several}} close white friends, and both Woods and Wilson insisted {{that he was not}} a racist. Woods related that Biko [...] "simply wasn't a hater of people", and that he did not even hate prominent National Party politicians like B. J. Vorster and Andries Treurnicht, instead hating their ideas. It was rare and uncharacteristic of him to display any rage, and was rare for him <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> about his doubts and inner misgivings, reserving those for a small number of confidants.|$|E

500|$|In 1890 at the {{formation}} of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), Stanton was elected president. She left such duties to Susan B.

In Greenbank, Bristol, Stanton met with English suffragist Helen Bright Clark, and spoke to a group about the Bible position of woman. Clark questioned whether Stanton's liberal views had shocked some in attendance, and Stanton replied: [...] "Well, if we who do see the absurdities of the old superstitions never unveil them to others, how is the world to make any progress in the theologies? I am in the sunset of life, and I feel it to be my special mission <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> what they are not prepared to hear..." ...|$|E
500|$|The SCLC {{decided that}} {{economic}} pressure on Birmingham businesses {{would be more}} effective than pressure on politicians, a lesson learned in Albany as few blacks were registered to vote in 1962. In the spring of 1963, before Easter, the Birmingham boycott intensified during the second-busiest shopping season of the year. Pastors urged their congregations to avoid shopping in Birmingham stores in the downtown district. For six weeks supporters of the boycott patrolled the downtown area to make sure blacks were not patronizing stores that promoted or tolerated segregation. If black shoppers were found in these stores, organizers confronted them and shamed them into participating in the boycott. Shuttlesworth recalled a woman whose $15 hat ($ in [...] ) was destroyed by boycott enforcers. Campaign participant Joe Dickson recalled, [...] "We had to go under strict surveillance. We had <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>people,</b> say look: if you go downtown and buy something, you're going to have to answer to us." [...] After several business owners in Birmingham took down [...] "white only" [...] and [...] "colored only" [...] signs, Commissioner Connor told business owners that if they did not obey the segregation ordinances, they would lose their business licenses.|$|E

500|$|On 16 October 2009, Wilders {{arrived in}} the United Kingdom and was quickly forced to move his press conference due to protests by about forty members of the {{organization}} Islam4UK, an organization that was later shut down under the UK's Terrorism Act 2000 on 14 January 2010. Though the Home Office had asserted that his entry into the country would not be blocked, a spokesman said his [...] "statements and behaviour during a visit will inevitably impact on any future decisions to admit him." [...] His visit to the UK met with protest, but Wilders called it [...] "a victory" [...] in a press conference.
