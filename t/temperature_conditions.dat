5|$|On June12, a {{tropical}} disturbance developed off {{the west coast}} of Costa Rica, moved westward and entered the eastern Pacific after crossing Panama. The system became better organized as it tracked to the west-northwest as a westerly Kelvin wave provided favorable conditions for development. Convection increased around a developing low pressure area, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated a 50% chance of tropical cyclogenesis by late on June12. After further organization, the NHC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Three-E at 0300UTC on June14, while the system was located about 515mi (830km) south-southeast of Puerto Ángel, Oaxaca. At the time, the depression was located in an area of low wind shear and warm sea surface <b>temperature</b> <b>conditions</b> that were considered favorable for intensification. In addition, it had a small circulation, which increased the possibility for rapid deepening. The system moved northwestward after forming due to an extended ridge to the northeast. About six hours after forming, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Carlotta, after rainbands increased around the center.|$|E

40|$|To {{improve the}} work {{performance}} of a 2;D mirror gimbal for the lunar;based telescope, the thermal;structural coupled analysis was carried out, and the analysis results were verified by thermal and onboard tests. According to the given input conditions, thermal loads and the thermal boundary, the finite element model was established to calculate the temperature fields of the mirror gimbal and main heating components. Through inputting the temperature loads, preloads and the boundary conditions into the finite element model, the thermal deformation and stress of the U;shape structure, precision moving shafting systems and the worm gears were obtained. Then, the expressions of friction moment were derived, and analytical data were used to the expressions to achieve the friction moment of shafting systems. On {{the basis of the}} friction moment, a proper moment motor was chosen. After calculation, the results show that the left shafting system has a larger friction moment at the low <b>temperature</b> <b>condition</b> of; 25, and the maximal one is up to 14. 163 N·mm; While the friction moment is smaller under high <b>temperature</b> <b>condition</b> 55, and the maximal one is 4. 796 N·mm. The results also show friction moment of the azimuth shafting systems at a low <b>temperature</b> <b>condition</b> of; 25 is 16. 45 N·mm. Moreover, the vertical shaft system shows its friction moment to be 16. 45 N·mm at the low <b>temperature</b> <b>condition</b> of; 25, while it is zero at the high <b>temperature</b> <b>condition</b> because of shafting system unloading. The results indicate the reflection mirror gimbal works well between; 25 to 55.

For solids content, low will handle up to 15% solid content. Above this level is considered high solids content and can also be known as dry digestion. In a single stage process, one reactor houses the four anaerobic digestion steps. A multistage process utilizes two or more reactors for digestion to separate the methanogenesis and hydrolysis phases.|$|E
25|$|To {{estimate}} insect age, forensic entomologists {{must determine}} {{the amount of}} time a particular insect spends in each stage of development and apply this information to temperature data at a crime scene to determine a post-mortem interval estimation.

Post-mortem intervals are estimated by determining the accumulated degree days (ADD) or accumulated degree hours (ADH) acquired by each insect stage on the remains; this information is then used to calculate the overall degree days or degree hours accumulated during the insect’s entire life cycle and association with the carcass, representing the minimal amount of time the body has been available for colonization by insects.
