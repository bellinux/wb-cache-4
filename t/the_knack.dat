The two victories brought him the First Class Iron Cross, awarded 19 December 1916. His first victory of 1917, over Captain Daly, inadvertently taught Voss <b>the</b> <b>knack</b> of deflection shooting. Voss later visited Daly in hospital twice.|$|E
5|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the system was determined not by how long a sensor would last in the field, but by the adequacy of coverage by a particular string of sensors. For instance, a well placed string with several failed sensors was more effective than a fully functional string placed in the wrong location. The electronic data was, however, {{only as good as}} the human analysts and operators at the ISC. <b>The</b> <b>knack</b> of timely sensor activation depended on careful study of device locations and the patterns of PAVN logistical behavior.|$|E

Notting Hill also serves as the locale for the 1999 romantic comedy Notting Hill, starring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant.|$|E
25|$|The general {{positioning}} {{of the field and}} the blocking of the batsmen's known strokes was admirable, and his placing was responsible for at least three of the catches made. He certainly has <b>the</b> <b>knack</b> of keeping his men equable and happy. If there were just a little more punch or bite in his make-up one could regard Yardley as a thoroughly satisfactory England captain of the near future.|$|E
25|$|Sorum's {{work with}} Chateau {{produced}} a four-song set that {{was covered by}} local radio stations for a short time, but the music scene changed from grandiose rock to punk and alternative new wave music.

5000|$|Fieger has {{acknowledged}} that, like many songs on <b>the</b> <b>Knack's</b> first two albums, [...] "Baby Talks Dirty" [...] was {{written about the}} same Sharona Alperin who inspired [...] "My Sharona".|$|R
5000|$|The album {{includes}} a cover version of <b>The</b> <b>Knack's</b> 1979 hit [...] "My Sharona" [...] and the hit single [...] "Sometime Samurai" [...] {{which is a}} collaboration with Kylie Minogue. Minogue and Tei collaborated previously on Tei's 1998 album Sound Museum.|$|R
5000|$|To many critics, <b>the</b> <b>Knack's</b> image {{seemed too}} {{contrived}} and their attitude too brash, and soon {{there was a}} backlash against their overnight success. San Francisco conceptual artist Hugh Brown, who had designed the Clash's Give 'Em Enough Rope album cover, started a [...] "Knuke the Knack" [...] campaign complete with T-shirts, buttons and bumper stickers. Some music writers began to criticize the band for what they perceived as arrogance, hype and a misogynist attitude expressed in their songs. The band's refusal to do interviews was also viewed negatively by the music press. One entertainment weekly, Scene magazine, refused to publish a review of <b>the</b> <b>Knack's</b> concert in Cleveland due to what it called [...] "attempts at censorship" [...] by the band's management.|$|R
25|$|Cameron was a lower-order {{right-handed}} batsman of uncomplicated {{methods and}} a bowler who {{began as a}} prodigious leg-spin and googly bowler, but turned to off-breaks when he lost <b>the</b> <b>knack</b> of finger spin. He came to early fame as a schoolboy cricketer in 1931 when, having played for Taunton School, he was picked for the Rest of England side against the Public Schools XI and took all 10 wickets in the Schools' innings for 49 runs. The next season, 1932, he played a couple of matches for Somerset.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes, the {{problems}} with pushers and helpers arose not from the hardware but the politics and the economics. In the 1880s, the BR and the Erie shared locomotive facilities at Clarion Junction. They had an agreement that each company would provide helper service {{to each other on}} the basis of whose engine was first up at the enginehouse when a train came along needing a push. After some years of this, the BR management realized that their engines were doing most of the work. The Erie crews had acquired <b>the</b> <b>knack</b> of finding something wrong with their engines, keeping them conveniently immobilized {{when it was time for}} work. The agreement ended.|$|E
25|$|Band {{members have}} cited power pop leaders Cheap Trick and Matthew Sweet as major influences. They also have cited the Talking Heads as an inspiration. John D. Luerssen of Allmusic {{has stated that}} they sound similar to <b>The</b> <b>Knack,</b> The Calling, and label-mates Fountains of Wayne. Mikael Wood of Baltimore City Paper has {{compared}} the Click Five to Fall Out Boy and the All-American Rejects in terms of sound and crossover appeal. In terms of songwriting, Bill Lamb of About.com has remarked that they seem reminiscent of The Beatles and The Beach Boys. Gary Susman of Entertainment Weekly has stated their vocal harmonies are similar to Queen, but they sing more like the Backstreet Boys.|$|E

25|$|In 1981, Bruce {{collaborated with}} guitarist Robin Trower and {{released}} two power trio albums, B.L.T. and Truce, {{the first of}} which was a minor hit in the US. By 1983, Bruce was no longer contracted to a major record company and released his next solo album, Automatic, on a minor German label, Intercord. A European tour followed to promote the album enlisting Bruce Gary from <b>The</b> <b>Knack</b> (who had also played in Bruce's 1975 band) on drums and Sancious from his 1980 band (Jack Bruce & Friends) on guitar and keyboards. In 1982, Bruce played with a short-lived ensemble A Gathering of Minds, composed of Billy Cobham, Allan Holdsworth, Didier Lockwood and David Sancious at Montreux. In 1983, Bruce sang on tracks 5 and 6 of the Allan Holdsworth album Road Games.|$|E
25|$|At age nineteen, he was {{approached}} {{to play an}} American, Junior Sailen, in the film The War Lover (1962), which starred Steve McQueen. To prepare for the role, he would spend hours listening to Woody Woodbury, a famous American comedian of the time, to try to perfect an American accent. After The War Lover, Crawford briefly returned to the stage and, after playing the lead role in the 1963 British film Two Left Feet, was offered {{a role in the}} British television series, Not So Much a Programme, More a Way of Life, as the Mod-style, tough-talking, motorbike-riding Byron. It was this character that attracted film director Richard Lester to hire him for the role of Colin in <b>The</b> <b>Knack</b> …and How to Get It in 1965. The film was a huge success in the UK.|$|E
25|$|The {{vocabulary}} of Lysias is relatively simple and {{would later be}} regarded as a model of pure diction for Atticists. Most of the rhetorical figures are sparingly used—except such as consist in the parallelism or opposition of clauses. The taste of the day not yet emancipated from the influence of the Sicilian rhetoric probably demanded a large use of antithesis. Lysias excels in vivid description; he has also <b>the</b> <b>knack</b> of marking the speaker's character by light touches. The structure of his sentences varies a good deal according to the dignity of the subject. He has equal command over the periodic style (κατεστραμμένη λέξις) and the non-periodic or continuous (εἰρομένη, διαλελυμένη). His disposition of his subject-matter is always simple. The speech has usually four parts: introduction (προοίμιον), narrative of facts (διήγησις), proofs (πίστεις), which may be either external, as from witnesses, or internal, derived from argument on the facts, and, lastly, conclusion (ἐπίλογος).|$|E
500|$|... "My Bologna" [...] {{demonstrated}} the [...] {{fine art of}} making the stupid much stupider. A later album title by this artist would be Dare to Be Stupid, and if <b>the</b> <b>Knack's</b> [...] "My Sharona" [...] had to be sacrificed at his creative altar {{for this to be}} understood, so be it.|$|R
5000|$|DJ Miko {{has also}} made many {{appearances}} on the Eurodance compilation album Dancemania series, specifically its sub-series albums including Dancemania Speed and Dancemania Covers since 1999, and on Konami's Bemani series of rhythm music video games with his covers of Jigsaw's [...] "Sky High" [...] and <b>The</b> <b>Knack's</b> [...] "My Sharona".|$|R
5000|$|... "After the Love Has Gone" [...] is a 1979 hit single for Earth, Wind & Fire, {{written by}} David Foster, Jay Graydon, and [...] Bill Champlin for the album I Am.

500|$|On September 27, 1979, Yankovic {{received}} a type-written note from Dr. Demento informing him that [...] "My Bologna" [...] was a smash hit {{on his radio}} show, and that Capitol Records had contacted the station, requesting {{a copy of the}} spoof for <b>The</b> <b>Knack</b> themselves. Later, <b>The</b> <b>Knack</b> performed at Cal Poly, and Yankovic managed to approach the band and Rupert Perry (then-vice president of Capitol Records) backstage. He informed them of who he was, and, according to Yankovic, [...] " [...] Doug Fieger [...] said 'Oh, [...] a really a great song!' and then he turned to Rupert Perry and said 'You guys oughta put this song out on Capitol Records' and Rupert said 'OK, let's do it!'" [...] Yankovic was paid $500 for the song's master, as well as the master for the soon-to-be b-side track [...] "School Cafeteria". The [...] "My Bologna" [...] single was released on Christmas Day, 1979 (a month after The Knack's concert at Cal Poly) and Yankovic was given a six-month contract.|$|E
500|$|After a fallow {{period in}} the mid-1970s, the band {{experienced}} a revival during the late 1970s and early 1980s with albums Sleepwalker (1977), Misfits (1978), Low Budget (1979), Give the People What They Want (1981) and State of Confusion (1983). In addition, groups such as [...] Van Halen, The Jam, <b>The</b> <b>Knack,</b> The Pretenders and The Fall covered their songs, helping to boost The Kinks' record sales. In the 1990s, Britpop acts such as Blur and Oasis cited the band as a major influence. The Kinks broke up in 1996, {{a result of the}} commercial failures of their last few albums and creative tension between the Davies brothers.|$|E
500|$|Although Kennedy was not {{a gifted}} skater, he {{compensated}} with a fierce determination and tireless hard work. Among modern era players his style of play {{has been compared to}} Bobby Clarke and Jarome Iginla. Line-mate Howie Meeker said that while he was a much better skater than Kennedy, [...] Kennedy was a perfect fit into coach Hap Day's coaching style of emphasizing defense, positional hockey and physical play. He brought to the Leafs a classy, humble leadership and <b>the</b> <b>knack</b> for scoring goals when they were most needed. He fought for every inch of ice and was difficult to separate from the puck. He was also known for his agility, stick-handling, playmaking, passing skills and physical toughness.|$|E

5000|$|Incomplete is {{the third}} album by the Dutch death metal band Nembrionic. It was {{released}} in 1998 by Displeased Records.

500|$|After a fortuitous {{encounter}} with Doug Fieger (the {{lead singer of}} <b>The</b> <b>Knack),</b> and Rupert Perry (then-vice president of Capitol Records), Capitol Records decided to release it as a single. Yankovic was paid $500 for the master tape of the song, and its b-side, [...] "School Cafeteria". A month after its commercial release, the single managed to sell 10,000 copies. The song also received positive—albeit limited—reviews from media outlets. Although a music video was never produced for the song, an [...] "unofficial" [...] video was filmed, featuring a young Yankovic lip-syncing to this song at Cuesta College in December 1979. [...] "My Bologna" [...] was later re-recorded and released on Yankovic's debut album (1983), and the [...] "bathroom version" [...] was re-released on the box set [...] (1994).|$|E
500|$|In 1979, {{while he}} was still a student at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) in San Luis Obispo, California, Alfred “Weird Al” Yankovic {{recorded}} a rough parody of [...] "My Sharona" [...] by <b>The</b> <b>Knack</b> entitled [...] "My Bologna". Fortuitous circumstances led to the song being released by Capitol Records on December 25, 1979. Although the single managed to sell 10,000 copies a month after its release, Yankovic soon learned that Capitol had no interest in promoting the record, or releasing a follow-up single. After graduating in 1980 with a Bachelor of Science degree in architecture, Yankovic still had an interest in releasing parody music, and soon turned his attention to [...] "Another One Bites the Dust" [...] by rock band Queen. The song had been written by Queen bassist John Deacon and released on their 1980 album The Game.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Alfred “Weird Al” Yankovic, {{was a student}} at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) in San Luis Obispo, California, and in his spare time, he was a DJ for the university’s radio station, KCPR. Yankovic had a penchant for comedy music, and often played it on his radio show. In the summer of 1979, [...] "My Sharona" [...] by <b>The</b> <b>Knack</b> was a {{particularly}} popular song, and Yankovic started to consider spoofing the single. This parody eventually came to fruition during an ad hoc jam session with his friend and fellow KCPR DJ, Jon Iverson; while Iverson played the main riff to [...] "My Sharona" [...] on his guitar, Yankovic began to write lyrics for his parody. Yankovic's lyrics eventually coalesced into [...] "My Bologna", an ode to the Oscar Mayer brand of Bologna sausage. The duo started to play it in and around the Cal Poly campus at parties and local theaters.|$|E
50|$|The group’s first {{recordings}} {{were composed}} and produced in 1986 with Sheridan’s longtime friend Jonah Koslen, and released as the soundtrack for {{an episode of}} MGM’s TV series “F.A.M.E.” which guest starred Bramlett. Soon <b>The</b> <b>Knack's</b> drummer Bruce Gary suggested that they add Crespo to their line up. After Koslen left the group, they tried a series of notable drummers until Taylor ultimately fit best.|$|R
