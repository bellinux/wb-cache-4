Comparisons of different national labour markets and the investigation of how institutions such as labour laws influence the emergence (or suppression) of dependently self-employment, or even other types of self-employment, are certainly aspects that should generate research. In addition, qualitative research may provide insights into the considerations, feelings, motivations, and experiences of <b>the</b> dependently <b>self-employed.</b> Dependent self-employment may serve these workers best, {{but even with the}} best data currently available, we are unfortunately unable to answer all these questions.|$|R

Since 2006, these labour market policy instruments are combined as start-up subsidies (Gründungszuschuss).
