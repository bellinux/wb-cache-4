50|$|The wartime {{upgrading}} {{of telecommunications}} from Townsville to Thursday Island was a dedicated defence facility, but was linked {{directly to the}} 1880s overland telegraph. An R <b>Type</b> <b>Carrier</b> System, developed in Australia during World War II to cater for pockets of telecommunications traffic congestion, particularly in places where a telephone carrier was not available to supply a channel for a voice frequency system, was installed along the old overland telegraph route from Mount Surprise to Cape York. The R Type system was limited to four duo-directional channels using a frequency between 3300 and 5220 cycles per second, which was above normal voice frequency but below the range of other established carrier systems, which used high frequency bands. There was no interference when both normal speech frequency and the carrier frequency operated over the same pair of copper wires. In effect, one pair of copper wires from Townsville to Thursday Island was to carry 3 facilities: normal voice frequency telephone, upgraded telegraph carrier, and a telephone carrier.|$|E

In this paper we introduce a new AMR method based on time and spectral domain features of the received signal. A neural network is used as the classifier.

However, the effect of impurity becomes prominent when it is applied to the sub-cell with lower current.

40|$|Disinfectants play an {{important}} role in controlling microbial contamination on hard surfaces in hospitals. The effectiveness of disinfectants in real life can be predicted by laboratory tests that measure killing of microbes on carriers. The modified Quantitative Disk Carrier Test (QCT- 2) is a standard laboratory method that employs American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) Type 430 stainless steel carriers to measure hospital disinfectant efficacy against Clostridium difficile spores. The formation of a rust-colored precipitate was observed on <b>Type</b> 430 <b>carriers</b> when testing a peracetic acid (PAA) -based disinfectant with the QCT- 2 method. It was hypothesized that the precipitate was indicative of corrosion of the <b>Type</b> 430 <b>carrier,</b> and that corrosion could impact efficacy results. The objective of this study was to compare the suitability of AISI Type 430 to Type 304 stainless steel carriers for evaluating PAA-based disinfectants using the QCT- 2 method. Type 304 is more corrosion-resistant than Type 430, is ubiquitous in healthcare environments, and is used in other standard methods. Suitability of the carriers was evaluated by comparing their impacts on efficacy results and PAA degradation rates. In efficacy tests with 1376 ppm PAA, reductions of C. difficile spores after 5, 7 and 10 minutes on <b>Type</b> 430 <b>carriers</b> were at least about 1. 5 log 10 lower than reductions on <b>Type</b> 304 <b>carriers.</b> In conditions simulating a QCT- 2 test, PAA concentration with <b>Type</b> 430 <b>carriers</b> was reduced by approximately 80 % in 10 minutes, whereas PAA concentration in the presence of <b>Type</b> 304 <b>carriers</b> remained stable. Elemental analyses of residues on each <b>carrier</b> <b>type</b> after efficacy testing were indicative of corrosion on the <b>Type</b> 430 <b>carrier.</b> Use of <b>Type</b> 430 stainless steel carriers for measuring the efficacy of PAA-based disinfectants should be avoided as it can lead to an underestimation of real life sporicidal efficacy. Type 304 stainless steel carriers are recommended as a suitable alternative...|$|R

Thin films of La 2 / 3 A 1 / 3 MnO 3 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba, Ce) and BFO were grown by magnetron sputtering on conducting lattice-matched Nb-doped SrTiO 3 substrates while the organic films were prepared as top layers onto the oxide layers by thermal evaporation. Nonlinear electrical properties and magnetoresistance of the heterostructures have been investigated in a wide temperature range (78  K   -   400  K).

40|$|Vesicular drug {{delivery}} system {{can be defined as}} highly ordered assemblies consisting of one or more concentric bilayers formed as a result of self-assembling of amphiphilic building blocks in presence of water. Vesicular {{drug delivery}} systems are particularly important for targeted delivery of drugs because of their ability to localize the activity of drug at the site or organ of action thereby lowering its concentration at the other sites in body. Vesicular {{drug delivery system}} sustains drug action at a predetermined rate, relatively constant (zero order kinetics), efficient drug level in the body, and simultaneously minimizes the undesirable side effects.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of obtaining a detailed {{picture of the}} electronic structure makes surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) eminently suitable for bridging {{the gap between the}} chemical, physical, optical and electrical properties of semiconductors. In SPS, changes in band bending (both at the free semiconductor surface and at buried interfaces) are monitored as a function of external illumination. Surface photovoltage spectroscopy can provide detailed, quantitative information on bulk properties (e. g. bandgap and <b>type,</b> <b>carrier</b> diffusion length and lifetime) and can be used for complete construction of surface and interface band diagrams, including the measurement of energy levels in quantum structures. A particular strength is that a comprehensive analysis of surface and bulk defect state distributions and properties is made possible. Measurements using SPS are contactless and non-destructive. In addition, they can be performed both in situ and ex situ, at any reasonable temperature, on any semiconducting material, at any ambient and at any lateral resolution down to the atomic scale.
