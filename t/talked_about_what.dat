[...] Chris Herbert booked the group's first professional songwriting session with the producers at the Strongroom in Curtain Road, East London, in January 1995. Rowe recalls feelings similar to Stannard's: [...] "I love them. Immediately. [...] They were like no one I'd met before, really." [...] The session was productive; Stannard and Rowe discussed the songwriting process with the group and <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> the group wanted to do on the record. In her autobiography, Brown recalls that the duo instinctively understood their point of view and knew how to incorporate [...] "the spirit of five loud girls into great pop music." ...|$|E
500|$|Scholarship {{since the}} 1970s {{has tended to}} move away from a pure study of iconography, instead {{emphasizing}} the paintings' and artists' relation to the social history of their time. According to Craig Harbison, [...] "Social history was becoming increasingly important. Panofsky had never really <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> kind of people these were." [...] Harbison sees the works as objects of devotion with a [...] "prayer book mentality" [...] available to middle-class burghers who had the means and the inclination to commission devotional objects. Most recent scholarship is moving away from the focus on religious iconography; instead, it investigates how a viewer is meant to experience a piece, as with donor paintings that were meant to elicit the feeling of a religious vision. James Marrow thinks the painters wanted to evoke specific responses, which are often hinted at by the figures' emotions in the paintings.|$|E

HuffPost TV Crystal Bell applauded Adler [...] "for doing such an amazing job" [...] on the suicide scene. She stated, [...] "I would have preferred if Karofsky's story line would have been the focus of the entire episode." [...] VanDerWerff commented that [...] "as the show got the little details of Karofsky's desperate act just right, the whole thing took on a weight", and singled out the scene [...] "where the teachers <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> had happened and the smash cut to Karofsky's father screaming at him to get up" [...] as [...] "heart-wrenching". Bell declared that the [...] "best scene in the entire episode is when Kurt visits Karofsky in the hospital". Lynch called it [...] "one of the most touching scenes of this season" [...] and [...] "guileless, well-acted and eye-watering".

500|$|After {{the season}} finale, Bell talked about Coulson losing his arm, saying that [...] "he paid a price—that was {{important}} to us. You don't mess with {{the forces of nature}} without getting bitten, {{and the fact that he}} literally saved everyone on the ship by that crystal not shattering was a wonderful, heroic thing and showed you that at heart, Coulson is a heroic man whose actions back up his words." [...] Bell also talked about the cliffhanger involving Simmons being absorbed by a Kree monolith: [...] "When we first started talking about the Monolith, we knew that it needed to present a threat and we needed to demonstrate some of that threat and the promise of more story... It's easy to kill a character for shock value or whatever, and we did have a number of deaths this season, but ... we prefer to leave you with something to talk about, to walk away with. This is something that came up in the room, we <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> it meant ... The idea of getting Fitz and Simmons—who had been one person—to become two whole people, come back together, agree to go on a date, and then have this happen, felt beautifully poetic".|$|E
500|$|The {{sequence}} where Karofsky attempts suicide {{was greatly}} praised on many levels; Slezak called it [...] "as devastating as anything I’ve seen on TV this year".

Crystal Bell of HuffPost TV applauded Adler [...] "for doing such an amazing job" [...] on the suicide scene. She stated, [...] "I {{would have preferred}} if Karofsky's story line {{would have been the}} focus of the entire episode." [...] BuddyTV John Kubicek was critical of the entire storyline, and wrote that teen suicide was [...] "one of those incredibly sensitive issues" [...] that [...] "shouldn't be taken on so directly by a light, silly musical comedy like Glee". VanDerWerff commented that [...] "as the show got the little details of Karofsky's desperate act just right, the whole thing took on a weight", and singled out the scene [...] "where the teachers <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> had happened and the smash cut to Karofsky's father screaming at him to get up" [...] as [...] "heart-wrenching"; he added, [...] "This was the Glee I had first loved, the Glee that could blend music and romance and comedy and highly volatile drama into one cocktail", though he also said that the episode had failed to [...] "pay off those emotions". Bell declared that [...] "best scene in the entire episode is when Kurt visits Karofsky in the hospital". Joseph Brannigan Lynch of Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "one of the most touching scenes of this season" [...] and [...] "guileless, well-acted and eye-watering".

500|$|In May 1969, U.S. Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird began {{publicly}} questioning North Vietnamese {{treatment of}} U.S. prisoners. [...] On June 5, 1969, a United Press International report described a Radio Hanoi broadcast that denied any such mistreatment. The broadcast used excerpts from McCain's forced [...] "confession" [...] {{of a year}} before, including a statement where {{he said he had}} bombed [...] "cities, towns and villages" [...] and had received [...] "very good medical treatment" [...] as a prisoner. [...] In late 1969, treatment of McCain and the other POWs suddenly improved. [...] North Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh had died the previous month, possibly causing a change in policy towards POWs. [...] Also, a badly beaten and weakened POW who had been released that summer disclosed to the world press the conditions to which they were being subjected, and the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, which included McCain's brother Joe, heightened awareness of the POWs' plight. [...] In December 1969, McCain was transferred back to the Hoa Lo [...] "Hanoi Hilton"; his solitary confinement ended in March 1970. [...] When the prisoners <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> they wanted to do once they got out, McCain said he wanted to become President. [...] McCain consented to a January 1970 interview outside Hoa Lo with Spanish-born, Cuban psychologist , that was published in the official Cuban newspaper Granma. McCain talked about his life and expressed no remorse for his bombing North Vietnam, and Barral proclaimed him [...] "an insensitive individual without human depth." [...] The POWs issued an edict forbidding any further such interviews, and despite pressure from his captors, McCain subsequently refused to see any anti-war groups or journalists sympathetic to the North Vietnamese regime.|$|E
