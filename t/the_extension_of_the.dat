5|$|In 1956, Toronto's midtown {{area was}} {{starting}} to experience growth.

5|$|By 1951, Dawson Creek {{had more}} than 3,500 residents. In 1952, the John Hart Highway linked the town {{to the rest of}} the British Columbia Interior and Lower Mainland through the Rocky Mountains; a new {{southbound}} route, known locally as Tupper Highway, made the town a crossroads with neighbouring Alberta. The next year, western Canada's largest propane gas plant was built and federal government offices were established in town. In 1958, <b>the</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Great Eastern Railway to the Peace from Prince George was completed, and the village was re-incorporated as a city. Between 1951 and 1961, the population of Dawson Creek more than tripled. The RCAF center reemerged on 1 October 1956 and was declared functional in 1958. It was disbanded a final time in March 1964.|$|E

To allow for <b>the</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line south from Times Square, the entire western wall of the subway between 43rd Street and 44th Street was removed, all while service continued uninterrupted. The line was mostly built in an open-cut, excluding the segments {{within the limits of}} Battery Park, the widened portions of Varick Street, and the new Varick and Seventh Avenue Extensions. Filled in ground was found south of Varick Street along Greenwich Street, which approximately marked the old shore line of the Hudson River {{during the time of the}} American Revolution. Many buildings had to be underpinned during the construction of the line, especially those on the lower sections through Greenwich Street.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Metropolitan Railway to Ruislip, and the {{resulting}} influx of visitors to the area, Albert Cross built a bungalow from where teas were served to day-trippers. This became a success and Cross had the building expanded, which soon became the Orchard Hotel. Between 1933 and 1971 it became an Ansells licensed bar and well known high class restaurant. It then became a Beefeater steak house, which it remains, and was recently extended with a Premier Inn hotel. During the Battle of Britain, the Orchard was very popular with the pilots of No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron stationed at RAF Northolt, who celebrated many of their successes in battle there. The owner was known to open {{a bottle of champagne}} for each German aircraft shot down by the squadron.|$|E
