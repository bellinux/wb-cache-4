25|$|The contradictions between <b>the</b> <b>Ordinary's</b> {{and other}} {{accounts}} {{can be found}} in the differences of tone used; the real problem is not <b>the</b> <b>Ordinary's</b> imaginative power, but his credulity or sensitivity to the fantasies of criminals sentenced to die.|$|R

5|$|Of <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> magistrates, {{there are}} two further divisions: the higher magistrates, {{composed}} of consuls, praetors, their prorogued equivalents, and the censors; and the lower magistrates, composed of the tribunes, aediles, quaestors, and other minor positions.

5|$|Although {{not usually}} {{identified}} as a genre writer, William S.

5|$|If that is so, {{it is not}} unthinkable that {{circumstances}} could arise {{where the}} courts may have to qualify a principle established on a different hypothesis of constitutionalism.

5|$|In United States v. More (1805), the Court {{held that}} <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> means of appeal, the writ of error, {{could not be}} {{utilized}} in criminal cases from the circuit courts.
