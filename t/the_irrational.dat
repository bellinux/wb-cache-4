50|$|Under {{the usual}} (Euclidean) {{distance}} function d(x, y) = |x &minus; y|, the real numbers are a metric space and hence also a topological space. Restricting the Euclidean distance function gives <b>the</b> <b>irrationals</b> <b>the</b> {{structure of a}} metric space. Since <b>the</b> subspace of <b>irrationals</b> is not closed,the induced metric is not complete. However, being a G-delta set - i.e., a countable intersection of open subsets - in a complete metric space, <b>the</b> space of <b>irrationals</b> is completely metrizable: that is, there is a metric on <b>the</b> <b>irrationals</b> inducing <b>the</b> same topology as the restriction of the Euclidean metric, but with respect to which <b>the</b> <b>irrationals</b> are complete.

5|$|The Cuu Long {{conference held}} between 6 and 10 October {{was the first}} provincial-level conference to be held. By 22 October, 21 provinces had held provincial-level party conferences. The central party {{leadership}} faced less criticism on the draft Political Report and socio-economic policies from the provincial-level conferences than by district-level conferences. The provincial-level conferences criticized central policies less and were evasive about critical issues. However, the provincial-level conferences were not completely dormant and scored some minor victories, such as reducing the average age needed to join an executive committee and they adopted a more flexible and efficient mode of planning and organization. As during the district-level conferences, there were certain convocations which attracted attention; the An Giang Party Committee criticized past economic performance, while the Ha Son Binh Congress criticized <b>the</b> <b>irrational</b> management of provincial economic affairs. While these committees criticized past policies or well-known deficiencies, none of them criticized {{the policies of the}} central party leadership.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present some}} new methods for {{constructing}} a Michael space, a regular Lindelöf space {{which has a}} non-Lindelöf product with <b>the</b> space of <b>irrationals.</b> <b>The</b> central result is a combinatorial statement about <b>the</b> <b>irrationals</b> which is a necessary and sufficient condition {{for the existence of}} a certain class of Michael spaces. We also show that there are Michael spaces assuming d =cov(M) and that it is consistent with cov(M) < b < d that there is a Michael space. The influence of Cohen reals on Michael’s problem is discussed as well. Finally, we present an example of a Michael space of weight less than b under the assumption that b = d =cov(M) =ℵω+ 1 (whose product with <b>the</b> <b>irrationals</b> is necessarily linearly Lindelöf).

25|$|Some {{economists have}} criticized the {{efficiency}} of democracy, citing the premise of <b>the</b> <b>irrational</b> voter, or a voter who makes decisions without {{all of the facts}} or necessary information {{in order to make a}} truly informed decision. Another argument is that democracy slows down processes because of the amount of input and participation needed in order to go forward with a decision. A common example often quoted to substantiate this point is the high economic development achieved by China (a non-democratic country) as compared to India (a democratic country). According to economists, the lack of democratic participation in countries like China allows for unfettered economic growth.|$|E

The earlier painting uses witchcraft imagery in a manner that inverts the order of traditional Christian iconography.
