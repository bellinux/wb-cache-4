30|$|Eleven {{volatile}} compounds were measured: (E)- 2 -Hexenal, 1 -Hexanol, Heptanal, 2 -acetyl- 1 -pyrroline, Octane, 1 -Heptanol, 1 -Octen- 3 -ol, Octanal, Benzyl alcohol, Benzeneacetaldehyde, and 3, 8 -Dimethylundecane. For Yuxiangyouzhan, shading treatments {{significantly increased}} relative content in (E)- 2 -Hexenal. S 3 significantly increased relative content in 2 -AP. Shading treatments (S 2 and S 3) significantly decreased relative content in Octane. S 1 treatment significantly increased <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> content <b>of</b> Octanal and Benzyl alcohol. For Nongxiang 18, shading treatments (S 2 and S 3) significantly increased <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> content <b>of</b> (E)- 2 -Hexenal.

40|$|Three pigeons {{performed}} on two-component multiple variable-interval variable-interval schedules of reinforcement. There were two independent variables: component duration and <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> frequency <b>of</b> reinforcement in a component. The component duration, which {{was always the}} same in both components, was varied over experimental conditions from 2 to 180 sec. Over these conditions, <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> frequency <b>of</b> reinforcement in a component was either 0. 2 or 0. 8 (± 0. 03). As the component duration was shortened, <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> frequency <b>of</b> responding in a component approached a value equal to <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> frequency <b>of</b> reinforcement in that component. When <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> frequency <b>of</b> reinforcement was varied over conditions in which the component duration was fixed at 5 sec, <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> frequency <b>of</b> responding in a component closely approximated <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> frequency <b>of</b> reinforcement in that component. That is, the familiar matching relationship, obtained previously only with concurrent schedules, was obtained in multiple schedules with a short component duration...|$|R

40|$|Nine pigeons {{were used}} in two {{experiments}} in which a response was reinforced if a variable-interval schedule had assigned a reinforcement and if the response terminated an interresponse time within a certain interval, or class, of interresponse times. One such class was scheduled on one key, and a second class was scheduled on a second key. The procedure was, therefore, a two-key concurrent paced variable-interval paced variable-interval schedule. In Exp. I, the lengths of the two reinforced interresponse times were varied. <b>The</b> <b>relative</b> frequency <b>of</b> responding on a key approximately equalled <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> reciprocal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> length of the interresponse time reinforced on that key. In Exp. II, <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> frequency and <b>relative</b> magnitude <b>of</b> reinforcement were varied. <b>The</b> <b>relative</b> frequency <b>of</b> responding on the key for which the shorter interresponse time was reinforced was a monotonically increasing, negatively accelerated function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> frequency <b>of</b> reinforcement on that key. <b>The</b> <b>relative</b> frequency <b>of</b> responding depended on <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> magnitude <b>of</b> reinforcement in approximately {{the same way as}} it depended on <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> frequency <b>of</b> reinforcement. <b>The</b> <b>relative</b> frequency <b>of</b> responding on the key for which the shorter interresponse time was reinforced depended on the lengths of the two reinforced interresponse times and on <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> frequency and <b>relative</b> magnitude <b>of</b> reinforcement {{in the same way as}} <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shorter interresponse time depended on these variables in previous one-key concurrent schedules of reinforcement for two interresponse times...|$|R

30|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> {{permittivity}} <b>of</b> concrete {{in the old}} bridges {{were strongly}} influenced by seasonal variations. A statistical analysis showed that <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> humidity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air was the most influential factor affecting <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> permittivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concrete, among the four main weather factors (temperature, rainfall, wind speed, and <b>relative</b> humidity). <b>The</b> <b>relative</b> permittivity <b>of</b> concrete measured using the surface reflection method is informative of near-surface conditions of the bare concrete bridge decks, where the water ratio is reasonably assumed {{to be close to}} <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> humidity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air. Therefore, seasonal variations in relative humidity should be properly taken into account for more accurate interpretation of concrete conditions when using relative permittivity measurements.|$|R
5|$|A Book of the Dead papyrus was {{produced}} to order by scribes. They were commissioned {{by people in}} preparation for their own funeral, or by <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> someone recently deceased. They were expensive items; one source gives {{the price of a}} Book of the Dead scroll as one deben of silver, perhaps half the annual pay of a labourer. Papyrus itself was evidently costly, as there are many instances of its re-use in everyday documents, creating palimpsests. In one case, a Book of the Dead was written on second-hand papyrus.|$|E
5|$|Many crash {{survivors}} suffered long recoveries {{from the}} physical and psychological traumas they endured. A month after the crash, an orderly caravan of around 1,000 vehicles drove to JFK while some demonstrators laid wreaths in the international terminal lobby to protest {{the handling of the}} flight. Some survivors sued the FAA, accusing the agency of failing to ensure the flight's safety. In July 1990, Avianca offered $75,000 to crash survivors and <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> those killed. The U.S. government eventually joined Avianca and reached a settlement estimated at over $200million in damages to the victims.|$|E
5|$|Then {{the girl}} was pulled into the tent and the men started to beat on the shields so her screams could not be heard. Six men entered the tent to have {{intercourse}} with the girl, after which they forced her onto her master's bed. Two men grabbed her hands, and two men her wrists. The angel of death put a rope {{around her neck and}} while two men pulled the rope, the old woman stabbed the girl between her ribs with a knife. Thereafter, <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> the dead chieftain arrived with a burning torch and set the ship aflame.

5|$|Rosecroft {{was sold}} to Mark Vogel in 1987. Vogel made several {{mistakes}} that hurt the horse racing industry in Maryland. Three years later, {{he was arrested for}} possession of cocaine, and his company went into bankruptcy. Rosecroft {{was sold to}} Weisman's Colt Enterprises in 1991. In that same year, the grandstand caught fire and was reconstructed in 1993 for $3.6 million. In 1995, after losing millions, <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> Weisman sold Rosecroft to Cloverleaf Enterprises. In the 2000s, Cloverleaf attempted to sell Rosecroft multiple times, but due to lawsuits and politics, all the potential buyers became uninterested. Nearby states legalized casinos to help their racetracks. Money generated from the casinos was used to increase the purses and handle (daily betting turnover), and Rosecroft was unable to produce the same amount of money. After filing for bankruptcy once again, Rosecroft Raceway closed down in 2010. The next year, Penn National Gaming purchased the racetrack with the hope to make it a racino, and Rosecroft reopened in 2011.|$|E

5|$|The jury deliberated for 23hours. On June 2, 1997, McVeigh {{was found}} guilty on 11counts of murder and conspiracy. Although the defense argued for a reduced {{sentence}} of life imprisonment, McVeigh was sentenced to death. In May 2001, the Justice Department announced that the FBI had mistakenly failed to provide over 3,000documents to McVeigh's defense counsel. The Justice Department also announced that the execution would be postponed for one month for the defense to review the documents. On June 6, federal judge Richard Paul Matsch ruled the documents would not prove McVeigh innocent and ordered the execution to proceed. After President George W. Bush approved the execution (McVeigh was a federal inmate and federal law dictates that the President must approve the execution of federal prisoners), he was executed by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute in Terre Haute, Indiana, on June 11. The execution was transmitted on closed-circuit television so that <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> the victims could witness his death.

5|$|Within 12 {{hours of}} the attack the UVF's Brigade Staff (Belfast leadership) issued a statement. It was {{released}} under the heading Ulster Central Intelligence Agency – Miami Showband Incident Report:A UVF patrol led by Major Boyle was suspicious of two vehicles, a minibus and a car parked near the border. Major Boyle ordered his patrol to apprehend the occupants for questioning. As they were being questioned, Major Boyle and Lieutenant Somerville began to search the minibus. As they began to enter the vehicle, a bomb was detonated and both men were killed outright. At the precise moment of the explosion, the patrol came under intense automatic fire from the occupants of the other vehicle. The patrol sergeant immediately ordered fire to be returned. Using self-loading rifles and sub-machine guns, the patrol returned fire, killing three of their attackers and wounding another. The patrol later recovered two Armalite rifles and a pistol. The UVF maintains regular border patrols due to the continued activity of the Provisional IRA. The Mid-Ulster Battalion has been assisting the South Down-South Armagh units since the IRA Forkhill boobytrap which killed four British soldiers. Three UVF members are being treated for gunshot wounds after last night but not in hospital.It {{would appear that the}} UVF patrol surprised members of a terrorist organisation transferring weapons to the Miami Showband minibus and that an explosive device of some description was being carried by the Showband for an unlawful purpose. It is obvious, therefore, that the UVF patrol was justified in taking the action it did and that the killing of the three Showband members should be regarded as justifiable homicide. The Officers and Agents of the Ulster Central Intelligence Agency commend the UVF on their actions and tender their deepest sympathy to <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> the two Officers who died while attempting to remove the bomb from the minibus.|$|E
