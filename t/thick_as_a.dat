5|$|Anderson {{performed}} the entire album live on tour in 2012, the first complete performances since the original tour. In August 2014, Anderson released the CD/DVD/Blu-ray <b>Thick</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Brick - Live in Iceland. The concert {{was recorded in}} Reykjavík, Iceland, on 22 June 2012 and featured complete <b>Thick</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Brick and <b>Thick</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Brick 2 performances by the Ian Anderson Touring Band. Some of the humour and stage antics were maintained, specially the telephone ringing {{in the middle of}} the song, replaced by a cell phone and a Skype call.|$|E

5|$|The {{follow-up}} {{album was}} released on 2 April 2012. It describes five different scenarios of Gerald Bostock's life, where he potentially becomes a greedy investment banker, a homeless homosexual man, {{a soldier in the}} Afghan War, a sanctimonious evangelist preacher, and a most ordinary man who runs a corner store and is married and childless. <b>Thick</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Brick 2 lists 17 separate songs merged into 13 distinct tracks (some labelled as medleys), although also all flowing together much like a single song. To follow the style of the mock newspaper on the original <b>Thick</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Brick, a mock online newspaper was set up.|$|E

5|$|<b>Thick</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Brick is {{the fifth}} studio album by the British rock band Jethro Tull, {{released}} in March 1972. The album contains a continuous piece of music, split over two sides of an LP record, and was deliberately designed to parody the concept album genre. The original packaging, designed like a newspaper, claims the album to be a musical adaptation of an epic poem by the fictional 8-year-old genius Gerald Bostock, though the lyrics were actually written by the band's frontman, Ian Anderson.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thick</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Brick was {{originally}} {{scheduled for release}} on 25 February 1972. It was held back a week to 3 March following production problems relating to the 1972 miners' strike. The album reached the top 5 in the UK charts, and number one in Australia, Canada and the United States, where it was certified Gold.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in late 1971, featuring music composed by Anderson and arranged with the contribution of all band members. The live show promoting the album included the playing of the full suite, with various comic interludes. <b>Thick</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Brick is considered by critics {{to be the first}} release by Jethro Tull entirely consisting of progressive rock music. It received mixed reviews upon its release: nonetheless, it was a commercial success and topped various charts in 1972. Today it is regarded as a classic of progressive rock and has received several accolades. Anderson produced a follow-up to the album in 2012, focusing on the adult life of the fictional Gerald Bostock.|$|E
60|$|I can not {{conceive}} of such <b>a</b> thing <b>as</b> Genoa in ruins. Such massive arches, such ponderous substructions as support these towering broad-winged edifices, we have seldom seen before; and surely the great blocks of stone of which these edifices are built can never decay; walls that are <b>as</b> <b>thick</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> ordinary American doorway is high cannot crumble.|$|R
50|$|On the {{outskirts}} of Przyborze {{there is an old}} Evangelical-Augsburg cemetery from 19th century, where ancient iron crosses are preserved (the oldest is from 1862). The oldest grave of a landsowner Carl Gottlib is from 1858. The cemetery is also known for the common ivy, which grows on the trees and its stems are <b>thick</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> arm of an adult human.|$|R

5|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} is very thin {{compared}} to its lateral dimensions. If a typical mammalian cell (diameter ~10 micrometers) were magnified {{to the size}} of a watermelon (~1ft/30cm), the lipid bilayer making up the plasma membrane would be about as <b>thick</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> piece of office paper. Despite being only a few nanometers thick, the bilayer is composed of several distinct chemical regions across its cross-section. These regions and their interactions with the surrounding water have been characterized over the past several decades with x-ray reflectometry, neutron scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thick</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Brick {{was viewed}} by some critics as Jethro Tull's first {{progressive}} rock album. The album has {{a variety of}} musical themes, time signature changes and tempo shifts – all of which were features of the progressive rock scene. Although the finished album runs as one continuous piece, it is made up of a medley of individual songs that run into each other, none of which individually lasts {{more than a couple of}} minutes. Parts of the suite blend classical and folk music into the typical rock music framework.|$|E
25|$|The largest impacts {{produced}} melt {{sheets of}} molten rock that covered {{portions of the}} surface that could be as <b>thick</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> kilometer. Examples of such impact melt {{can be seen in}} the northeastern part of the Mare Orientale impact basin.|$|E

50|$|Most of {{the health}} {{concerns}} associated with polycythemia vera are caused by the blood being <b>thicker</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of the increased red blood cells. It {{is more common in}} the elderly and may be symptomatic or asymptomatic. Common signs and symptoms include itching (pruritus), and severe burning pain in the hands or feet that is usually accompanied by a reddish or bluish coloration of the skin. Patients with polycythemia vera {{are more likely to have}} gouty arthritis. Treatment consists primarily of phlebotomy.|$|R
60|$|I {{have had}} further {{experience}} as well. I {{spent three years}} in the graduate school of Chicago, where coeducational girls were <b>as</b> <b>thick</b> <b>as</b> autumn leaves, and some <b>thicker.</b> And <b>as</b> <b>a</b> college professor at McGill University in Montreal, I have taught mingled classes of men and women for twenty years.|$|R
25|$|Since 2000, more {{products}} and techniques {{have been developed}} to make lip augmentation more effective and patient friendly. The relative ease of many injections is due to surgeons using tiny 30 and 31 gauge (about as <b>thick</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> dozen human hairs) needles that are used to inject the very sensitive lips. Nonetheless, topical anesthesias are often used for lip augmentation procedures.|$|E
500|$|Prog {{magazine}} included <b>Thick</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Brick {{at number}} 5 in their list [...] "The 100 Greatest Prog Albums of All Time", while Rolling Stone listed the album at number 7 in their [...] "Top 50 Prog Albums of All Time". <b>Thick</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Brick is ranked number 2 in the user-managed website Prog Archives's top albums list, {{with an average}} rank of 4.64 stars. Rush's Geddy Lee has said <b>Thick</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Brick {{is one of his}} favourite albums, as did Iron Maiden's Steve Harris.|$|E
500|$|The {{thematic}} elements Jethro Tull explored on the album—those of {{the effects}} of urbanisation on nature, and {{of the effects}} of social constructs such as religion on society—would be developed further on most of the band's subsequent releases. Ian Anderson's frustration over the album's labelling as a concept album directly {{led to the creation of}} <b>Thick</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Brick (1972), intended to be a deliberately [...] "over the top" [...] concept album in response.|$|E

50|$|Boomslangs are oviparous, {{and produce}} up to 30 eggs which are {{deposited}} in hollow tree trunks or rotting logs. The eggs {{have a relatively}} long (three months on average) incubation period. Male hatchlings are grey with blue speckles, and female hatchlings are a pale brown. They attain their adult coloration after several years. Hatchlings are approximately 20 cm in length and pose no threat to humans, but are dangerously venomous {{by the time they}} reach a length of about 45 cm and <b>a</b> girth <b>as</b> <b>thick</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> adult's smallest finger.|$|R
50|$|When a {{plate of}} oceanic crust is subducted beneath an {{overriding}} plate of oceanic crust, as the underthrusting crust melts, it can cause upwelling of magma that can cause volcanism along the subduction front on the overriding plate. This produces an oceanic chain of volcanoes, like Japan. This volcanism causes metamorphosis of rocks, intrusions of magma that produce rocks such as granite, and thickens the crust by depositing additional layers of rock from volcanoes. This tends to make the crust lighter and <b>thicker,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result making it immune to subduction.|$|R
500|$|Contemporary reviews were mixed. Chris Welch of Melody Maker {{praised the}} musicianship {{of the band}} and Anderson's flute playing, writing also that [...] "the joke {{at the expense of}} a local {{newspaper}} wears thin rather rapidly, but should not detract from the obvious amount of thought and work that has gone into the production of Thick"; he described the music as a creative effort where [...] "the ideas flow in super abundance" [...] but that [...] "needs time to absorb" [...] and [...] "heard out of context of their highly visual stage act... does not have such immediate appeal". Tony Tyler in his review for New Musical Express generally appreciated the construction of the suites and the arrangements, but he had doubts about the album's possible success. He called <b>Thick</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Brick [...] "Jethro Tull's own stand-or-fall epic after the lines of Tommy" [...] and [...] "an assault on the mediocrity and harshness of lower-middle-class existence in '70s Britain". Ben Gerson in Rolling Stone magazine called <b>Thick</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Brick [...] "one of rock's most sophisticated and ground-breaking products". Going further, the reviewer stated: [...] "Martin Barre's guitar and John Evan's keyboards especially shine, and Ian's singing is no longer abrasive. Whether or not <b>Thick</b> <b>As</b> <b>A</b> Brick is an isolated experiment, it is nice to know that someone in rock has ambitions beyond the four- or five-minute conventional track, and has the intelligence to carry out his intentions, in all their intricacy, with considerable grace." [...] Rolling Stones Dave Marsh gave it 2 out of 5 stars in The Rolling Stone Record Guide, judging it had [...] "relatively undifferentiated movements". American critic Robert Christgau disliked the album, calling it [...] "the usual shit: rock (getting heavier), folk (getting feyer), classical (getting schlockier), flute (getting better because it has no choice)".|$|E

500|$|While TAAB 2 was a {{follow-up}} about Gerald Bostock, the 2014 Ian Anderson solo album Homo Erraticus {{was presented as}} {{a follow-up}} work by Gerald Bostock. In the backstory Anderson created for the album, the now middle-aged Bostock came across an unpublished manuscript by one Ernest T. Parritt (1873–1928), entitled [...] "Homo Britanicus Erraticus". Parritt was convinced he lived past lives as historical characters, and wrote detailed accounts of these lives in his work; he also wrote of fantasy imaginings of lives yet to come. Bostock then created lyrics based on Parritt's writings, while Anderson set them to music. As with the original <b>Thick</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Brick, authorship of each song on this album is explicitly credited to both Anderson and Bostock.|$|E

50|$|The {{life cycle}} of the hamadryad is rather complex: {{juvenile}} and near-adult hamadryads are snake-like limbless creatures, of minimal intelligence, with a very simple central nervous system. The juvenile owned by Cahuella is described as being 12 metres in length and roughly <b>as</b> <b>thick</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> adult human's torso for most of that length, weighing more than a tonne. Being limbless, the creatures move like snakes on Earth. Their cold-bloodedness means that they generally move slowly, feeding infrequently, and are remarkably long-lived, with a longevity of hundreds of years. Being the largest native land-based lifeforms, the hamadryad has no real predators.|$|R
