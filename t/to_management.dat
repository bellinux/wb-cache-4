He briefly took up advisory roles at Wrexham and then at Tranmere Rovers, helping former Liverpool captain Ron Yeats at the latter. In November 1976, the press speculated that Shankly would make a return <b>to</b> <b>management</b> as the successor to Dave Mackay at Derby County, but the position went to Colin Murphy instead. John Toshack recalled that Shankly was a great help to him when he went into management with Swansea City in 1978. Despite being in his sixties, Shankly kept himself fit and often took part in five-a-side football. If nothing else was available he would join teams of youngsters in kickabouts.|$|E

He signed goalkeeper Marius Røvde, midfielder Jim Whitley, and gave striker Hector Sam his debut, but failed to keep Wrexham away from the relegation zone. With relegation confirmed, new signing Lee Jones scored all five goals in a 5–0 win over Cambridge United, leaving cause for optimism at the Racecourse Ground.|$|E

40|$|The “opt-out revolution” {{has become}} a much-discussed {{phenomenon}} over the last decade. According to media reports, highly educated women are increasingly opting out of careers that would place them {{on the fast track}} <b>to</b> top <b>management</b> levels. However, little attention has been devoted to whether the opt-out revolution may also apply to highly educated men. The present study examined individuals' aspirations <b>to</b> top <b>management,</b> which provide an indication {{of the extent to which}} they are opting in or opting out of careers that might lead <b>to</b> top <b>management.</b> Participants were drawn from two populations, undergraduate business students and part-time (evening) MBA students. Part-time MBA students were found to be significantly less likely to aspire <b>to</b> top <b>management</b> (i. e., more likely to “opt out” of careers aimed at the highest managerial level) than undergraduate business students, especially male part-time MBAs compared with male undergraduates; male part-time MBAs were least likely to aspire <b>to</b> top <b>management</b> of the four combinations of sex and population. However, contrary to prior research, women's and men's aspirations <b>to</b> top <b>management</b> did not significantly differ. Also, individuals with a gender identity of high masculinity were significantly more likely to aspire <b>to</b> top <b>management</b> (i. e., “opt in”) than individuals with a low-masculinity gender identity. These results suggest that further study of the opt-out revolution should incorporate gender-related constructs such as gender identity and devote attention to men's as well as women's aspirations <b>to</b> top <b>management...</b>|$|R
