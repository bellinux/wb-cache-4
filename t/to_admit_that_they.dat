5|$|Attitudes {{and social}} {{stereotypes}} can create {{barriers to the}} detection and treatment of alcohol abuse. This {{is more of a}} barrier for women than men. Fear of stigmatization may lead women to deny that they are suffering from a medical condition, to hide their drinking, and to drink alone. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be less likely to suspect that a woman they know is an alcoholic. In contrast, reduced fear of stigma may lead men <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are suffering from a medical condition, to display their drinking publicly, and to drink in groups.

Investigators speculated that Kinne had already crossed the border from Mexico into Guatemala, mooting the purpose of a Mexican manhunt, but noted that Kinne was fluent in Spanish after her years in Mexican prison, and she could therefore be [...] "get along rather well" [...] in nearly any Spanish-speaking area of the world.

500|$|Some serious {{discrepancies}} between Allied squadron records and German claims have caused some historians and Allied veterans {{to question the}} accuracy of Marseille's official victories, {{in addition to those}} of JG 27 as a whole. Attention is often focused on the 26 claims made by JG 27 on 1 September 1942, of which 17 were claimed by Marseille alone. Another biographer, Franz Kurowski, claims that 24 of the 26 victories were verified through Allied records after the war. A USAF historian, Major Robert Tate states: [...] "or years, many British historians and militarists refused <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had lost any aircraft that day in North Africa. Careful review of records however do show that the British [...] did lose more than 17 aircraft that day, and in the area that Marseille operated." [...] Tate also reveals 20 RAF single-engined fighters and one twin engined fighter were destroyed and several others severely damaged, as well as a further USAAF P-40 shot down. However, overall Tate reveals that Marseille's kill total comes close to 65–70 percent corroboration, indicating as many as 50 of his claims may not have been actually kills. Tate also compares Marseilles rate of corroboration with the top six P-40 pilots. While only the Canadian James Francis Edwards' records shows a verification of 100 percent other aces like Clive Caldwell (50% to 60% corroboration), Billy Drake (70% to 80% corroboration), John Lloyd Waddy (70% to 80% corroboration) and Andrew Barr (60% to 70% corroboration) are at the same order of magnitude as Marseille's claims. Christopher Shores and Hans Ring also support Tate's conclusions. British historian Stephen Bungay gives a figure of 20 Allied losses that day.|$|E

[...] On 12January therefore, Kent enlisted the aid of the two physicians who attended Fanny in her last days, and with Broughton, went to Cock Lane. [...] On the house's upper floor Elizabeth Parsons was publicly undressed, and with her younger sister was put to bed. [...] The audience sat around the bed, positioned in the centre of the room. [...] They were warned that the ghost was sensitive to disbelief and told that they should accord it due respect. [...] When the séance began, a relative of Parsons, Mary Frazer, ran around the room shouting [...] "Fanny, Fanny, why don't you come? [...] Do come, pray Fanny, come; dear Fanny, come!" [...] When nothing happened, Moore told the group the ghost would not come as they were making too much noise.

40|$|The 1961 case of King v Barclay is {{something}} of a footnote in the history of discrimination against Black Canadians. If it is cited at all, it is usually cited alongside the more famous racism cases, such as Christie v York, as proof of the widespread nature of racism in Canada. In this paper, I re-read the trial decision and examine the original case file to show that the facts of King and the racism in the case are more complex than usually realized. King emerged out of a series of errors from both King and Barclay’s Motel which resulted in the latter assuming, or seeming to assume, that King wished to visit two prostitutes working out of the motel. For obvious reasons, however, Barclay’s Motel could not state such an allegation explicitly as that would have been tantamount <b>to</b> <b>admitting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> knew the women in question were prostitutes. In order to recapture the full legal and social contexts of King this paper examines both the history of racial discrimination in public accommodations and the longstanding struggle to prevent prostitutes from using such accommodations to ply their trade. The paper also argues that King’s legal action, even though he lost in court, was ultimately successful in that it prompted a legislative amendment, which removed the technicality upon which King turned...|$|R
