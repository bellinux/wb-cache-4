5|$|One of the Millennium Projects in the UK was the Scottish Seabird Centre, {{near the}} {{important}} bird sanctuaries on Bass Rock, Fidra {{and the surrounding}} islands.

5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} {{similar to a}} saw, except {{the height of the}} teeth {{increases}} over the length of the tool. Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining process because it has the feed built into the tool. <b>The</b> <b>profile</b> of the machined surface is always the inverse of <b>the</b> <b>profile</b> of the broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed {{and the size of the}} chip. The broach can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all of the features are built into the broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A broach is effectively a collection of single-point cutting tools arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is {{considered}} a powerful technique for generating personalized recommendations. Centralized storage of user profiles in CF systems presents a privacy breach, since <b>the</b> <b>profiles</b> are available to other users. Recent works proposed enhancing {{the privacy of the}} CF by distributing <b>the</b> <b>profiles</b> between multiple repositories. This work investigates how a decentralized distributed storage of user profiles combined with data perturbation techniques mitigates the privacy issues. Experiments, conducted on three datasets, show that relatively large parts of <b>the</b> <b>profiles</b> can be perturbed without hampering the accuracy of the CF. The experiments also allow conclusion to be drawn regarding the specific users and parts of <b>the</b> <b>profiles</b> that are valuable for generating accurate CF predictions. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} was {{designed}} to examine <b>the</b> <b>Profiles</b> of Prevention among non-drinking and non-smoking adolescents. Research across age groups (elementary, middle and high school), populations (U. S., U.

These profiles have demonstrated both internal and external validity in cross-sectional data. This longitudinal research focuses on students who remain substance free (movement within <b>the</b> <b>profiles</b> of prevention) and students who acquire the use of substances over time (movement out of <b>the</b> <b>profiles</b> of prevention). ^ This study investigates the acquisition of drinking and smoking among <b>the</b> four <b>profiles</b> of preventions as well as the movement within <b>the</b> <b>profiles</b> of prevention over time.
