Due to the extended length of time that trapping {{has been a part}} of the community, it should come as no surprise that the practice of trapping has gained cultural significance in southeastern Mexico. Unfortunately, the nature of the traps used in the past by the Mayan's is a mystery now, but present methods of gopher trapping can be observed. Two popular snares used in the modern day both make use of a spring, a snare, and a <b>tension</b> <b>line.</b> One trap is set off by a gopher running into a <b>tension</b> <b>line,</b> and another by a gopher chewing through a baited line.|$|E

40|$|In {{this letter}} the <b>line</b> <b>tension</b> {{associated}} with screw dislocations is considered.

Secondly, the relative magnitudes of the <b>line</b> <b>tension</b> on relevant cross-slip planes are calculated. The <b>line</b> <b>tension</b> on 〈 100 〉 and 〈 111 〉 screw dislocations {{is found to be}} fully independent of the cross-slip plane, whereas that of 〈 110 〉 screw dislocations depends sensitively on the cross-slip plane and is at a maximum on the cube cross-slip plane for most materials. The implications of a negative <b>line</b> <b>tension</b> are discussed and a locking mechanism of elastically unstable screw dislocation is proposed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The <b>line</b> <b>tension</b> of an {{electrolyte}} wetting a non-polar substrate is computed analytically and numerically. The {{results show}} that, {{depending on the}} value of the apparent contact angle, positive or negative <b>line</b> <b>tension</b> values may be obtained. Furthermore, a significant difference between Young's contact angle and the apparent contact angle measured several Debye lengths remote from the three-phase contact line occurs. When applying the results to water wetting highly charged surfaces, <b>line</b> <b>tension</b> values of the same order of magnitude as found in recent experiments can be achieved. Therefore, the theory presented may contribute to the understanding of <b>line</b> <b>tension</b> measurements and points to the importance of the electrostatic <b>line</b> <b>tension.</b> Being strongly dependent on the interfacial charge density, electrostatic <b>line</b> <b>tension</b> is found to be tunable via the pH value of the involved electrolyte. As a practical consequence, the stability of nanoparticles adsorbed at fluid-fluid interfaces is predicted to be dependent on the pH value. The theory is suited for future incorporation of effects due to surfactants where even larger <b>line</b> <b>tension</b> values can be expected. Comment: 8 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

The village of Tayap is not electrified {{despite the presence of}} a high <b>tension</b> <b>line</b> at the village of Omog. The absence of electricity is an important obstacle to the development of Tayap. The very light winds do not allow a wind-power solution. On the other hand, there is no river with hydroelectric potential close to the village (except at about 8k, accessible only by a bush path).|$|E
40|$|For the {{assessment}} of safety against free drift (loss of position) of semi-submersibles, the mooring system of a semi-submersible is introduced, and the mooring <b>line</b> <b>tension</b> is looked into based on the laboratory model test and the numerical simulations of Veslefrikk B platform. The work is mostly about the prediction of the mooring <b>line</b> <b>tensions.</b> Based on the model tests data, the characteristic mooring <b>line</b> <b>tension</b> is obtained, the breaking strength is the characteristic mooring <b>line</b> <b>tension</b> multiplied by safety factor. Then both 10 - 2  and 10 - 4 annual extreme mooring <b>line</b> <b>tensions</b> are estimated. By fitting the maximum 10 - 2  and 10 - 4  annual extreme mooring <b>line</b> <b>tensions</b> to a Gumbel distribution, the probability of any extreme mooring <b>line</b> <b>tension</b> can be obtained according to the Gumbel distribution. Thus the single mooring line failure probabilities for different given safety factors can be determined. In the time domain simulation program SIMO (MARINTEK), the mooring <b>line</b> <b>tensions</b> are simulated under the same environmental conditions as the model tests, and the same analysis procedure is carried out to the numerical simulations. At last, the full long term analysis is {{carried out by the}} numerical simulations. Large numbers of sea states are simulated. For every sea state, there are 10 seeding tests, and the 3 -hour extreme mooring <b>line</b> <b>tensions</b> are fitted to Gumbel. Then the response surfaces of Gumbel parameters are defined by the MATLAB 4 gird data method. The long term wave statics of the Veslefrikk field are given in the Veslefrikk Metocean Desgin Basis report [10]. After that, the long term probability for certain mooring <b>line</b> <b>tensions</b> can be calculated by integrating the conditional distribution of the 3 -hour maximum mooring <b>line</b> <b>tensions</b> for the given wave characteristics times the joint distribution function of the significant wave characteristics in the critical area of Hs and Tp. The long term distribution of the extreme mooring <b>line</b> <b>tensions</b> is finally determined. And the 100 -year and 10000 -year extreme values are estimated. </p...|$|R

When the <b>line</b> <b>tension</b> is negative, although equilibria would be unstable against modes that make the contact line wigglier and wigglier, the length over which the oscillations of destabilizing modes are effective can become too short compared ti the natural cut-off length given by the ratio between the line and the surface tensions of the droplet. Thus, provided that the <b>line</b> <b>tension</b> strength is not too large, conditionally stable equilibria exist, even when the <b>line</b> <b>tension</b> is negative...|$|R

Some possible complications of Z-plasty include flap necrosis, haematoma (blood clot) formation under the flaps, wound infection, trapdoor effect and sloughing (necrosis) of the flap caused by wound tension and inadequate blood supply.|$|E

In contrast, for non-retarded Van der Waals forces, and forces of still longer range, the <b>line</b> <b>tension</b> diverges at first-order wetting. The boundary tension along the prewetting line is positive and finite. Approaching wetting, it increases (with diverging slope) and converges {{to the value of}} the <b>line</b> <b>tension</b> at first-order wetting. Approaching first-order wetting at bulk phase coexistence, the <b>line</b> <b>tension</b> is finite provided the potentials decay faster than r- 5, and increases (with diverging slope) towards its limit at wetting.

40|$|The {{three-phase}} {{contact line}} of a liquid–liquid–fluid system is considered as {{the intersection of the}} three interfaces of different surface tensions and thickness.

40|$|We {{report a}} computer-simulation {{study of the}} free-energy barrier for the {{nucleation}} of pores in the bilayer membrane under constant stretching lateral pressure. We find that incipient pores are hydrophobic but as the lateral size of the pore nucleus becomes comparable with the molecular length, the pore becomes hydrophilic. In agreement with previous investigations, {{we find that the}} dynamical process of growth and closure of hydrophilic pores is controlled by the competition between the surface tension of the membrane and the <b>line</b> <b>tension</b> associated with the rim of the pore. We estimate the <b>line</b> <b>tension</b> of a hydrophilic pore from the shape of the computed free-energy barriers. The <b>line</b> <b>tension</b> thus computed is in a good agreement with available experimental data.
