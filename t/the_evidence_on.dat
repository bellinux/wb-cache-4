5|$|<b>The</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>on</b> the {{convergence}} of prices in the eurozone {{with the introduction of}} the euro is mixed. Several studies failed to find any evidence of convergence following the introduction of the euro after a phase of convergence in the early 1990s. Other studies have found evidence of price convergence, in particular for cars. A possible reason for the divergence between the different studies is that the processes of convergence may not have been linear, slowing down substantially between 2000 and 2003, and resurfacing after 2003 as suggested by a recent study (2009).|$|E
5|$|Fertility {{awareness}} methods involve {{determining the}} most fertile {{days of the}} menstrual cycle and avoiding unprotected intercourse. Techniques for determining fertility include monitoring basal body temperature, cervical secretions, or {{the day of the}} cycle. They have typical first-year failure rates of 24%; perfect use first-year failure rates depend on which method is used and range from 0.4% to 5%. <b>The</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>on</b> which these estimates are based, however, is poor as the majority of people in trials stop their use early. Globally, they are used by about 3.6% of couples. If based on both basal body temperature and another primary sign, the method is referred to as symptothermal. Overall first-year failure rates of <2% to 20% have been reported in clinical studies of the symptothermal method.|$|E

The NTSB determined that the only way for the observed split elevator condition to occur was if the left seat pilot (the captain's position) was commanding nose up while the right seat pilot (the first officer's position) commanded nose down.

500|$|In 1883, Middlesex {{refused to}} arrange matches with Lancashire {{due to the}} {{perceived}} unfair bowling of Crossland {{and some of his}} teammates. Nottinghamshire had their own complaints, and protested to the MCC regarding Crossland's residential qualification to play for Lancashire. During the previous season, a letter had been written to Cricket magazine suggesting that Crossland's qualification for Lancashire was invalid, as they claimed that although he was engaged on the Old Trafford ground staff for the summer, he continued to reside in Sutton-in-Ashfield during the winter. Crossland was summoned to Lord's over the matter, but the Lancashire committee refused to send him, stating that he was playing for them that day. The protest was eventually dismissed, though the MCC noted that [...] "it would be of value ... to have <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>on</b> both sides for future reference." [...] Neutral umpires were introduced in 1883, and there was some concern in Lancashire about whether Crossland would be no-balled during the first match of the year. The match against Derbyshire featured one of the most highly-regarded umpires, Thomas Brownhill from Yorkshire, and Crossland bowled without censure. In June that season, Crossland travelled as part of the Lancashire team to Lord's, to play against the Marylebone Cricket Club. The umpires for the match had been advised to be strict in applying the law on throwing, and it was noted in the press that Crossland had modified his bowling action, and no complaints could be made against it. The Daily News did suggest that [...] "if [...] always bowled as he bowled yesterday there would be no disputes about him—and he would not get many wickets." ...|$|E
500|$|During this period, Hand {{took part}} in three notable cases that posed a {{particular}} challenge to his impartiality on Cold War issues: United States v. Coplon, United States v. Dennis, and United States v. Remington. Department of Justice worker Judith Coplon had been sentenced to 15 {{years in prison for}} stealing and attempting to pass on defense information. In 1950, her appeal came before a Second Circuit panel that included Learned Hand. It rested on her claim that her rights under the Fourth Amendment had been infringed by a warrantless search, and that details of illegal wiretaps had not been fully disclosed at her trial. Hand made it clear that Coplon was guilty of the charges. However, he rejected the trial judge's conclusion that a warrantless arrest had been justified. He ruled therefore that papers seized during the arrest had been inadmissible as evidence. The trial judge's failure to disclose all the wiretap records, Hand concluded, made a reversal of Coplon's conviction necessary. In his written opinion, Hand stated that [...] "ew weapons in the arsenal of freedom are more useful than the power to compel a government to disclose <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>on</b> which it seeks to forfeit the liberty of its citizens." [...] Many followers of the trial sent Hand hate mail for his decision. By contrast, in the 1950 case United States v. Dennis, Hand affirmed the convictions under the 1940 Smith Act of eleven leaders of the Communist Party of the United States for subversion. He ruled that calls for the violent overthrow of the American government posed enough of a [...] "probable danger" [...] to justify the invasion of free speech. After the case, he was attacked from the opposite political direction for appearing to side with McCarthyism.|$|E
