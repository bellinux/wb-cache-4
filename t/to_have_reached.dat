5|$|High (early) dating hypothesis: Giovanni Pettinato {{supports}} {{an early}} dating for Ebla {{that would put}} the destruction at around 2500 BC. Pettinato, while preferring the date of 2500 BC, later accepted the event could have happened in 2400 BC. The scholar suggests the city was destroyed in 2400 BC by a Mesopotamian such as Eannatum of Lagash—who boasted of taking tribute from Mari—or Lugalzagesi of Umma, who claimed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>reached</b> the Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|On May 14, a {{tropical}} cyclone was observed {{just east of}} Samar, {{an island in the}} east-central Philippines.

The storm curved northeastward in the South China Sea, striking Taiwan on May 20. The storm proceeded through the Ryukyu Islands and was last noted on May 23.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps seen by Amerigo Vespucci in 1503, it {{was first}} {{formally}} described in 1839.

The species is classified in the otherwise mostly African genus Trachylepis and is thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>reached</b> its island from Africa by rafting. The enigmatic Trachylepis tschudii, supposedly from Peru, {{may well be the}} same species.|$|E

5|$|Development was {{initially}} slowed by locally cooler sea surface temperatures and dry air, and the depression became Tropical Storm Patricia later that day. Once {{clear of the}} unfavorable region, Patricia traversed anomalously warm waters within an environment exceptionally conducive to rapid intensification. Dramatic strengthening began late on October21 and continued through October23. Patricia reached hurricane strength shortly after 00:00UTC on October22, featuring prominent outflow, well-defined banding features, and a developing eye. Data from Hurricane Hunters investigating the cyclone indicated Patricia <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>reached</b> Category4 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale by 18:00UTC.|$|E

5|$|Early on July 23, {{the storm}} briefly became disorganized, with the {{low-level}} circulation becoming ill-defined. Around the same time, Emilia passed about 175mi (280km) southwest of Manzanillo, which was its closest approach to southwestern Mexico; {{it is believed}} to have caused tropical storm force wind gusts along the coastline. Later that day, after turning west-northwestward, the convection increased markedly as an eyewall began to form. Operationally, it was estimated <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>reached</b> winds of 70mph (115km/h), and it was forecast to continue strengthening to attain Category2 status on the Saffir-Simpson scale. However, the NHC later re-assessed Emilia as reaching peak winds of 65mph (105km/h), since the eye feature was temporary and not well-defined.|$|E
5|$|From 1972 to 2006, {{dramatic}} reductions {{continued in}} the number of feral honey bees in the U.S. and a significant though somewhat gradual decline {{in the number of}} colonies maintained by beekeepers. This decline includes the cumulative losses from all factors, such as urbanization, pesticide use, tracheal and Varroa mites, and commercial beekeepers' retiring and going out of business. However, in late 2006 and early 2007, the rate of attrition was alleged <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>reached</b> new proportions, and people began to use the term colony collapse disorder to describe this sudden rash of disappearances (or sometimes spontaneous hive collapse or the Mary Celeste syndrome in the United Kingdom).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Elida was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} of the 2002 Pacific hurricane season to reach Category5 strength on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Forming on July 23 from a tropical wave, the storm rapidly intensified from a tropical depression into a Category5 in twodays and lasted for only sixhours at that intensity before weakening. It {{was one of only}} sixteen known hurricanes in the East Pacific east of the International Date Line <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>reached</b> such an intensity. Although heavy waves were able to reach the Mexican coastline, no damages or casualties were reported in relation to the hurricane.|$|E
